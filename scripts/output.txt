TSLA 2.13% is voluntarily recalling about 123,000 Model S sedans globally after discovering that certain corroding bolts in cold weather climates could lead to a power-steering failure.  The Silicon Valley auto maker on Thursday said the recall, believed to be the company’s largest ever, applies to Model S sedans built before April 2016. Tesla said the issue is known to have involved less than 0.02% of the potentially affected vehicles in the U.S.  Tesla has sold about 280,000 total vehicles through the end of last year.  “There have been no injuries or accidents due to this component, despite accumulating more than a billion miles of driving,” according to an email being sent to customers by Tesla. The recall to retrofit the power steering component adds to the string of challenges Chief Executive Elon Musk is dealing with as he tries to boost production of the Tesla’s mass-market Model 3 sedan and conserve the company’s cash supply. Moody’s Investors Service this week downgraded Tesla’s credit rating, concerned that the company won’t meet its first-quarter goal of making 2,500 Model 3s a week. The milestone is important because further delays could crimp Tesla’s cash and threaten to derail Tesla’s bid to build electric cars for the masses. The downgrade, along with news this week that federal investigators were probing a fatal crash of a Tesla car, have led to a heavy selloff of the company’s shares and bonds, making it potentially more difficult to raise capital. On Thursday, Tesla’s stock rose 3.2%, to $266.13, during the regular trading session, and fell slightly in after-hours trading following the recall news. It has been a rough month for the stock, which has fallen about 20% over the 30-day period. Tesla is expected to reveal first-quarter production results early next week. The recall on Thursday only involves the Model S. Tesla said its service center in Montreal began noticing the issue in Model S sedans and attributed the corrosion to the calcium or magnesium salts used to treat roadways during the winter months. If the bolts fail, the car can still be steered but requires additional force. “This primarily makes the car harder to drive at low speeds and for parallel parking, but does not materially affect control at high speed, where only small steering wheel force is needed,” the company said. The cost of the recall is expected to be minimal, Tesla said, with the supplier paying for the new part.

Tesla Inc. TSLA 2.13% said it updated the pay package for Chief Executive Elon Musk with a plan that again ties his compensation entirely to key performance benchmarks—albeit this time much larger ones, including an ultimate goal to hit $650 billion in market value.  The pay plan, which shareholders must still approve, is designed to keep Mr. Musk as Tesla’s top leader for years to come—although allows for the prospect that he might evolve away from the day-to-day role of CEO into one of executive chairman and chief product officer.  The plan, which is modeled on an earlier program set for Mr. Musk in 2012, entails a 10-year grant of stock options that would vest in 12 tranches. Each would vest only if a set of two milestones are achieved, one based on market value, the other on a measure of revenue or profit. For each tranche achieved, Mr. Musk would receive shares equal to 1% of the company’s total shares outstanding as of Jan. 21, 2018.  For example, the first tranche would vest if Tesla hits $100 billion in market value and $20 billion in revenue or $1.5 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, after adjusting for stock compensation. For all 12 tranches to vest, Tesla’s market value would have to reach $650 billion.  Tesla, which reported revenue of $7 billion for 2016, had a market value of about $58.8 billion as of Monday’s close. Mr. Musk owns about 20% of the company, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.  “This ensures that Elon will continue to lead Tesla’s management over the long-term while also providing the flexibility to bring in another CEO who would report to Elon at some point in the future,” Tesla said in a statement about the plan released around 12:30 a.m. on Tuesday in California. “Although there is no current intention for this to happen, it provides the flexibility as Tesla continues to grow to potentially allow Elon to focus more of his attention on the kinds of key product and strategic matters that most impact Tesla’s long-term growth and profitability.”  Tesla said that if none of the tranches are achieved, Mr. Musk wouldn’t receive any compensation. That would put him in similar territory to some other prominent Silicon Valley leaders who own enormously valuable stakes in their companies but receive little or no salary.  Mr. Musk’s previous compensation program, granted in 2012, targeted a market value of $43.2 billion along with meeting certain milestones by 2022. It required him to remain as CEO.  Since Tesla overtook Ford Motor Co.’s market value last year, and flirted with that of General Motors Co. , the Silicon Valley auto maker’s valuation has been a continual point of conversation. Critics question why investors are betting so much on a company that has yet to turn an annual profit and that has delivered a fraction of the sales of much larger competitors.  Fans say they are betting on Mr. Musk’s vision for personal transportation that includes electric cars that drive themselves and are powered off the company’s solar panels and charged from its storage batteries.  Investor enthusiasm fueled Tesla’s growth last year, even as Mr. Musk struggled to ramp up production of the Model 3 sedan, which is testing his ability to evolve the company into a more mainstream auto maker from one of a luxury niche player.  Mr. Musk has previously outlined a way for the company to reach a market cap of $700 billion, something he reiterated last year.  “I could be completely delusional but I think I see a clear path to that outcome,” he told analysts in May.  Mr. Musk, who also heads other companies including Space Exploration Technologies Corp., or SpaceX, has hinted that he might want to change his role at Tesla.  In May, an analyst asked Mr. Musk if he still intended to step away from Tesla after bringing out the Model 3, as he had previously suggested.  “I intend to be actively involved with Tesla for the rest of my life,” Mr. Musk said. “Hopefully, stopping before I get too old—or too crazy, I don’t know. But that doesn’t mean I should be CEO forever.” He suggested a role contributing in “product design and technology.”  Write to Tim Higgins at Tim.Higgins@WSJ.com

https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-earnings-what-to-watch-1517999400
Tesla Inc. is expected to release fourth-quarter financial results after the market closes Wednesday. Here’s what you need to know:  EARNINGS FORECAST: Tesla is expected to post an adjusted loss of $3.15 a share, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet, compared with an adjusted 69 cent-a-share loss a year earlier. Adjusted results exclude stock-based and acquisition costs, and other items.  REVENUE FORECAST: Revenue is expected to rise to $3.29 billion, according to FactSet, from $2.28 billion a year earlier. Tesla has said deliveries of the Model X sport-utility vehicle, Model S sedan and new Model 3 sedan totaled 29,870 during the quarter, up 35% from a year ago. The company delivered 1,550 units of the Model 3, which began production in July.  WHAT TO WATCH:  PRODUCTION HELL: “We believe an update on the Model 3 production ramp will be the first question on many investors’ minds,” James Albertine, an analyst for Consumer Edge Research, said in a note to investors. Investors have watched Tesla fall months behind in its production goals after running into bottlenecks at its Fremont, Calif., assembly factory and Nevada battery plant. Chief Executive Elon Musk once had predicted reaching a rate of production of 5,000 Model 3 vehicles a week by the end of the last year’s fourth quarter—a prediction that had already fallen from 20,000 in December and, at one point, as many as 200,000 in the second half of 2017. Tesla ended up making 2,425 Model 3s in the fourth quarter, the company reported in January as it pushed back the goal of reaching 5,000 a week until the end of June.  CASH BURN: Mr. Musk has long said the ramp-up of the Model 3, a sedan with a $35,000 price tag aimed at making Tesla vehicles more accessible, would generate the cash needed to fund the company’s expansion. The sedan’s delays put that vision at risk. Tesla began the final three months of 2017 with $3.5 billion on hand and planned to spend $1 billion during the period on capital expenditures. Earlier this month, the company raised about $550 million from bonds. Tesla executives have said they need a minimum of $1 billion each quarter for working capital. Colin Langan, an analyst for UBS, estimates Tesla can generate about $1 billion in working capital once it produces 5,000 Model 3s a week. Even so, he and others expect Tesla will need to raise additional money.  WHAT’S NEXT: In recent months, Mr. Musk has generated attention talking about plans for new vehicles—a two-door Roadster sports car, commercial truck and compact SUV—as well as new factories in Europe and China. All would cost billions of dollars. In November, he and Chief Financial Officer Deepak Ahuja hinted at internal discussions about whether Tesla needed to back away from some of its growth plans to rein in spending. Investors are anxious for clarity about the evolving strategy. Excitement over the new products may already be helping Mr. Musk’s cash situation. Deposits in the fourth quarter for the new commercial truck and the sports car, as well as a sell-down in Model S and Model X inventory, may have boosted Tesla’s working capital by $700 million, according to Mr. Langan’s estimates.

Photo: Vadim Ghirda/Associated Press  Lately, even the good news at Tesla arrives with serious strings attached.  Analysts at brokerage firm Jefferies upgraded Tesla to hold on Monday morning, a welcome development after a brutal week for the high-flying electric automaker.  “We consider a small possibility of Tesla releasing supportive data this week,” the analysts wrote, in reference to Tesla’s forthcoming vehicle production and delivery report. The analysts also suggest a “high probability that management and the Board will take more drastic action on guidance and funding to restore credibility.”

A still image taken from a SpaceX livestream video shows ‘Starman’ sitting in a Tesla roadster after the Falcon Heavy rocket delivered it into orbit on Tuesday. Photo: SpaceX/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images  Tesla is literally flying high after Elon Musk’s successful rocket launch, which blasted a vehicle into outer space. Fourth-quarter earnings out Wednesday, however, still point to a number of challenges back here on Earth.  Tesla reported fourth-quarter revenue of $3.3 billion and an adjusted loss of $3.04 a share. That just beat the analyst consensus loss of $3.11. But a year ago, the consensus for the fourth quarter was a loss of 17 cents a share.  There were bright spots besides the earnings. Tesla burned just $277 million in free cash, a significant improvement from recent quarters. And the company managed to avoid lowering its Model 3 production forecast for a third time in three months. The cash burn appeared lower because Tesla included customer deposits for its planned new truck and roadster in its operating cash flow. That is deceiving because these deposits aren’t drawn from current operations.  Meanwhile, an alarming trend of negative operating leverage has yet to reverse itself—the more cars it sells the worse its margins become. Automotive gross margin fell to 13.8%, down more than 8 percentage points from a year earlier. That trend isn’t likely to meaningfully reverse any time soon. Tesla forecasts about 100,000 deliveries of its older Model S and X vehicles this year, which offer better profits than the Model 3. That won’t offer much, if any, growth from the 2017 tally of 101,000 cars.  The Model 3 is supposed to carry prices up to 65% below Tesla’s average selling price on older products; there will have to be substantial cost-cutting and improvements in production efficiency to even hold margins constant. Meanwhile, new industry competition coming this year won’t improve pricing power.  Granted, investor faith in Mr. Musk is as strong as ever, and Tesla still enjoys open access to capital markets. Fears of a crash in the stock price aren’t likely to materialize anytime soon.  However, Tesla’s chances of becoming a sustainable business that doesn’t need constant capital markets access to survive seems less likely than a sports car in orbit.

Tesla on Wednesday said the driver of the car was to blame, while his family said they were exploring legal options following the fatal accident. Photo: /Associated Press  Tesla Inc. TSLA 2.13% defended its semiautonomous Autopilot system in the wake of a fatal crash last month, blaming the incident on the driver after his family hired a lawyer to explore legal options.  Walter Huang died on March 23 after the Model X sport-utility vehicle he was driving southbound on Highway 101 near Mountain View, Calif., collided with a barrier and was struck by two other vehicles. The auto maker a week later said that the SUV’s Autopilot was activated in the moments leading up to the crash and that the driver’s hands weren’t detected on the wheel for six seconds before the crash.  On Wednesday, Tesla more explicitly assigned blame to the driver. “The crash happened on a clear day with several hundred feet of visibility ahead, which means that the only way for this accident to have occurred is if Mr. Huang wasn’t paying attention to the road, despite the car providing multiple warnings to do so,” a Tesla spokesman said in a statement.  Earlier on Wednesday, San Francisco-based Minami Tamaki LLP announced in a statement that the family had retained its services and plans to file a wrongful-death lawsuit. The family appeared on local television on Tuesday night defending Mr. Huang’s driving.  “The firm believes Tesla’s Autopilot feature is defective and likely caused Huang’s death, despite Tesla’s apparent attempt to blame the victim of this terrible tragedy,” the law firm said in a statement.  Investigators for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board are probing the crash. On April 1, the NTSB said it was unhappy with Tesla for releasing detailed information about the crash.  NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt and Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk had a recent discussion that appeared to defuse the tension. “Chairman Sumwalt had what he described as a very constructive conversation with Mr. Musk over the weekend,” a spokesman for the NTSB said. “They discussed the investigation of the March 23 Tesla crash, NTSB investigative processes, and Tesla’s work to address the safety recommendations that were issued last year as a result of the May 2016 Tesla crash in Williston, Florida.” ​The latter was a reference to a fatal crash involving Autopilot for which the NTSB determined Tesla shared blame.  Tesla declined to comment on the discussion.  The NTSB declined to comment​ on Tesla’s defense of its technology in the most recent fatal crash, while NHTSA had no immediate comment.​Separately, the NTSB spokesman said the agency was investigating a battery fire linked to a Tesla Model X SUV that crashed into a garage in Lake Forest, Calif., in August 2017. The NTSB is primarily interested in the battery fire in that incident, the spokesman said. Tesla declined to comment on the battery-fire probe.  Tesla’s Wednesday statement intensified its defense of semiautonomous technology amid greater scrutiny of whether humans can remain alert while using these systems. Auto makers are rolling out partially automated systems that pass control back and forth between vehicle and driver, some with technology designed to keep the driver alert, such as eye-tracking technology. Others, like Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo, believe there should be no need for a human to take control in driving situations.  Autopilot, which is a collection of “driver assistance features,” isn’t a self-driving system. Tesla tells users in its owner’s manual and in-vehicle display warnings that users need to remain alert and maintain control of the vehicle.  “We empathize with Mr. Huang’s family, who are understandably facing loss and grief, but the false impression that Autopilot is unsafe will cause harm to others on the road,” Tesla said Wednesday. “The reason that other families are not on TV is because their loved ones are still alive.”  Tesla had said earlier that the driver took no action despite having five seconds and about 500 feet of unobstructed view of the concrete highway divider.  The 2016 fatal crash in Florida put Tesla’s technology into the spotlight. The NTSB said Tesla shared partial blame for the crash, noting Autopilot allowed the driver to go long periods without his hands on the wheel and ignore the company’s warnings. NHTSA, however, said the system wasn’t defective and that Tesla vehicles’ crash rate dropped by almost 40% after the auto-steer feature was installed. The vehicle in the 2016 accident was equipped with the auto-steer feature.  After the NTSB findings in the 2016 crash, Tesla said it would continue to be clear with current and potential customers that Autopilot doesn’t render vehicles fully self-driving and that motorists must always remain attentive.

Emergency personnel work at the scene where a Tesla vehicle crashed in Mountain View, Calif., on March 23. Tesla said it had withdrawn from a so-called party agreement with the NTSB. Photo: KTVU/Associated Press  An unusual public feud between Tesla Inc. TSLA 2.13% and federal accident investigators escalated Thursday over the examination of a fatal car crash, sidelining the auto maker from an official probe concerning its semiautonomous driving system.  In dueling explanations, Tesla and the National Transportation Safety Board clashed over whether the company withdrew or was removed as an official party to the agency’s investigation into last month’s crash of a Model X sport-utility vehicle that killed the driver near Mountain View, Calif.  The NTSB said Thursday that it tossed Tesla from the probe, asserting the auto maker violated a formal agreement when it released detailed information this week about the crash before government investigators had vetted it.  Tesla late Wednesday, and again on Thursday, contended it dropped out, saying restrictions on disclosures could jeopardize public safety by blocking the timely release of relevant information to the public including about its semiautonomous driving system, called Autopilot.  The safety board countered that its procedures call for immediate recommendations if emergency safety fixes are required.  The dispute between an unconventional Silicon Valley electric-car maker and a small government agency with sizable influence over transportation safety illustrates how both sides are grappling with new investigative and public-relations issues stemming from crashes of vehicles with driverless-car technologies.  The safety board, with five members confirmed by the Senate, is responsible for investigating accidents across various transportation modes and then issuing nonbinding recommendations to regulatory authorities.  Despite a sterling world-wide reputation for dissecting aviation disasters, the NTSB lacks extensive experience looking into the complexities of autonomous systems controlling passenger vehicles.  While the safety board has no regulatory mandate, over the years its findings and recommendations have shaped aviation, railroad and pipeline operations. It has relied on companies and unions to participate in accident probes by contributing technical expertise, but those so-called parties to federal investigations have to follow strict prohibitions against unilaterally giving out information to the public or prematurely announcing conclusions to the media.  Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D., Conn.), who has long delved into auto-safety issues, said Thursday he was “troubled by Tesla’s reckless disregard” of its obligations to the NTSB. “If autonomous-vehicle manufacturers like Tesla cannot be trusted to fully cooperate, then it’s clear that Congress must act,” he said in a written statement.  A Tesla employee driving one of the company’s Model S electric vehicles, equipped with the semiautonomous Autopilot system Photo: Jasper Juinen/Bloomberg News  Removals from NTSB party agreements are rare. The agency in 2014 revoked party status for United Parcel Service Inc. and a pilots union in the probe of a crash of one of the package-delivery company’s cargo planes after public comments were made by each side about circumstances surrounding the accident.  For Tesla, a departure from the NTSB agreement risks diminishing the car maker’s influence over and insight into an investigation that could ultimately reach critical conclusions about one of the company’s signature products.  Tesla’s pugnacity toward the NTSB reflects its iconoclastic approach to corporate communications that often involves Chief Executive Elon Musk assailing critics on Twitter, even to the point of joking about the company’s financial ruin.  Unlike other car makers, Tesla doesn’t shy from confronting government agencies. On Thursday, it repeated an earlier point Mr. Musk had tweeted, calling the NTSB an “advisory body” as opposed to a “regulatory” one and describing its own relationship with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the main federal agency that oversees vehicle makers, “strong and positive.”  Autopilot has garnered investor enthusiasm and helped Tesla at one point surpass General Motors Co. as the U.S.’s most valuable auto maker by market capitalization. The technology has also drawn scrutiny, though, with the NTSB determining after the May 2016 fatal crash of a Tesla car that Autopilot allowed a driver to go long periods without hands on the wheel and ignore warnings, among other shortcomings from the vehicle.  The NTSB is also investigating the January crash of a Tesla Model S into the back of a firetruck near Culver City, Calif. The vehicle’s driver said Autopilot was engaged at the time of the crash, according to local firefighters. And the NTSB is probing the March 18 death of a pedestrian struck and killed in Arizona by an Uber Technologies Inc. self-driving car, though not a Tesla, that had a safety operator behind the wheel.  Tesla released information about the March 23 fatal crash under investigation several times recently, suggesting that the driver, Walter Huang, was to blame because, though Autopilot was activated before the crash, he still had at least five seconds to take over the wheel before it collided with a highway barrier.  The NTSB said such releases can prompt “speculation and incorrect assumptions about the probable cause of a crash, which does a disservice to the investigative process and the traveling public.”  NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt and Mr. Musk last Friday appeared to defuse tension, with the two men discussing the agency’s investigative processes and recommendations U.S. investigators made after the May 2016 fatal Tesla crash, according to a letter released Thursday.  But on Wednesday, Tesla came out with a stronger statement defending Autopilot and blaming the incident on Mr. Huang after his family hired a lawyer to explore legal options.  “The crash happened on a clear day with several hundred feet of visibility ahead, which means that the only way for this accident to have occurred is if Mr. Huang wasn’t paying attention to the road, despite the car providing multiple warnings to do so,” the company said.  The NTSB said it alerted Mr. Musk to the decision to revoke the company’s status as a party to the probe on Wednesday evening and through a letter delivered to the company the following day. “It is unfortunate that Tesla, by its actions, did not abide by the party agreement,” Mr. Sumwalt said.  Tesla said Thursday it needed to correct “misleading claims that have been made about Autopilot” that suggested the technology undermined safety. The auto maker accused the NTSB of being “more concerned with press headlines than actually promoting safety” and releasing “partial bits of incomplete information to the media in violation” of its own rules.  Tesla said it would make an official complaint to Congress, as well as a public-records request to “understand the reasoning behind [the NTSB’s] focus on the safest cars in America while they ignore the cars that are the least safe.”  Mr. Musk has been aggressive in rolling out partially automated driving technology, contending it enhances safety when used correctly. He has been working on making Tesla vehicles capable of fully piloting themselves, and investors have bid up the company’s stock partly because of Tesla’s progress with automated-driving technology.

The number of U.S. homeowners putting solar panels on their roofs declined last year after leading installers including Tesla Inc. abandoned aggressive sales practices that had helped drive breakneck growth.  Residential solar had been on a tear, averaging 49% annual growth between 2010 and 2016, but the number of megawatts added last year dropped by 16% compared with the year before, according to new data from GTM Research, a firm that tracks renewable energy. It was the first annual decline since at least 2000, which is as far back as GTM tracks figures.  Industry executives and energy experts said the slowdown was driven by a sharp retreat by national solar installers, including Tesla’s SolarCity and Vivint Solar Inc. VSLR -2.44% Those big outfits had deployed large sales forces to pitch homeowners on the benefits of rooftop solar, and heavily marketed deals to lease panels that required little to no money down.  The race to build a dominant national solar brand led companies to burn through cash. Unable to maintain that pace, companies scaled back and focused on profits over growth, or in some cases, got out of the rooftop solar business altogether.  SolarCity, purchased by Tesla in 2016, posted the largest declines. Once the clear-cut leader among solar installers, with one-third of the national market two years ago, it ended door-to-door sales last year and cut customer-acquisition spending. Its sales, as measured by megawatts deployed, fell by 38% in 2017, according to company figures, which include both residential and commercial installations.  Tesla said it was moving away from no-money-down leases and toward sales. It appears to have been passed by rival Sunrun Inc. RUN 0.35% in recent months as the top solar installer in the country, according to GTM.  “We expect growth to resume later this year,” Tesla said last month.  Other companies also retreated from heavily marketing their home solar businesses, including NRG Energy Inc., NRG 0.37% which shut its business last year, and Vivint, which posted a 17% drop in residential sales volume in 2017 as it moved to prioritize profitability. Sungevity Inc. filed for bankruptcy protection last year after an aggressive growth strategy resulted in too much debt, the company said in a court filing.  The industry’s sales strategies have attracted scrutiny by regulators in some states, including New Mexico, where the state attorney general, Hector Balderas, filed a lawsuit last month claiming that Vivint used “false, misleading and fraudulent statements” to sign customers up for long-term deals.  Rob Kain, Vivint’s vice president of investor relations, said the company disagrees with the allegations and plans to contest them in court.  “Could we have had a salesperson who was aggressive? I wouldn’t be surprised,” Mr. Kain said, adding that the company would have fired a salesperson for misrepresentations.  SolarCity grew with help from a hard-charging sales culture. Before being acquired by Tesla, the company, which was run by Lyndon Rive, the cousin of Tesla founder Elon Musk, tapped salespeople from the mortgage industry and Las Vegas casinos to sell solar panels, and gave them aggressive quotas, according to current and former managers and employees interviewed by The Wall Street Journal.  Last year, Tesla changed course and began selling solar panels through the same stores that sell its cars. Other sales approaches were shut down in order to “focus on projects with better margins,” the company said.  Eric White, president and chief executive of Dividend Finance , a San Francisco-based company that provides loans to homeowners putting solar on their roofs, said many solar companies acted too much like Silicon Valley firms, pursuing growth at all costs in hopes of becoming leaders in a nascent market.  Mr. White said that while the industry’s prior growth is “not sustainable and leaves bodies in its tracks,” 5%-to-15% annual increases are achievable.  Solar energy grew rapidly in recent years as the cost of solar panels declined. The all-in cost of a typical rooftop solar system fell by 61% between 2010 and 2017 to $2.80 per watt, or roughly $16,000 for the average home system, according to the federal government.  Solar executives and industry analysts believe annual residential solar growth will resume in 2018. But two developments risk hurting sales in coming years, say industry analysts. First, new Trump administration tariffs on imported solar modules, mostly from China, are expected to marginally raise costs. Second, a federal government tax incentive to homeowners worth 30% of the value of the solar array is set to end by 2021.  Lynn Jurich, chief executive of Sunrun, said rising utility electricity rates and falling solar panel costs will drive increased interest in solar.  “We saw an unnaturally high growth rate because there was a lot of capital coming in to spend on advertising and customer origination, and not a lot of discipline on focusing on profitable growth,” she said of the sector as a whole. “You suck all the advertising out of an industry and it shrinks.”  Still, companies continue to spend considerable amounts acquiring customers. Sunrun estimates it spends about 28 cents on marketing for every dollar spent on purchasing and installing panels.  Sophie Karp, an analyst at Guggenheim Securities, said industrywide customer-acquisition costs were higher.  “Solar is not a product that you buy,” she said. “It is a product that gets sold.”  —Kirsten Grind contributed to this article.

The wreckage of a Tesla vehicle after it crashed into a barrier on U.S. Highway 101 in Mountain View, Calif., last month.  The wreckage of a Tesla vehicle after it crashed into a barrier on U.S. Highway 101 in Mountain View, Calif., last month. Photo: stringer/Reuters  The National Transportation Safety Board expressed displeasure with Tesla TSLA 2.13% Inc.’s recent disclosure that the company’s semiautonomous driving system was activated before a fatal crash last month in California.  The agency, which dispatched a team last week to investigate the March 23 crash, said Sunday it is “unhappy” that Tesla revealed detailed information it had gleaned from vehicle logs about the collision, including its suggestion that the driver had time to put his hands on the wheel and react.  Tesla declined to comment Sunday about the NTSB statement.  The rare rebuke from the U.S. agency, which investigates significant accidents involving various transportation modes, comes amid mounting scrutiny of partial and fully automated driving technologies. The NTSB is also probing the March 18 death of a pedestrian fatally struck by an Uber Technologies Inc. self-driving vehicle with a safety operator behind the wheel in Tempe, Ariz.  Not long after the NTSB expressed its disapproval Sunday, Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk joked on Twitter that the company was going bankrupt. “Despite intense efforts to raise money, including a last-ditch mass sale of Easter eggs, we are sad to report that Tesla has gone completely and totally bankrupt,” he wrote. “So bankrupt, you can’t believe it.”  Mr. Musk’s tweet, which doesn’t appear to be in response to the NTSB, was timed for April Fools’ Day and Easter. But it also comes at a particularly sensitive time for Tesla, which is also in a tight cash situation as it tries to ramp up production of its mass-market car, the Model 3.  Tesla is expected to report first-quarter vehicle sales numbers this week, and the market will be carefully examining the company’s guidance on whether or not it can hit its oft-delayed goal, of producing 5,000 Model 3 cars each week, by the end of the second quarter. Analysts say that milestone is an inflection point for Tesla when the company can start generating cash.  Tesla’s shares had surged over the past couple of years on the promise that Mr. Musk could not only deliver an all-electric car for the masses, but also fulfill his vision of creating cars that drive themselves.  Tesla’s disclosure on Friday that the semiautonomous system, called Autopilot, was engaged before the fatal crash near Mountain View, Calif., immediately reignited questions about the technology. A man was killed after his Tesla Model X sport-utility traveling southbound on Highway 101 collided with a barrier and was struck by two other vehicles, according to the California Highway Patrol.  Tesla late Friday said Autopilot was activated in the seconds leading up to the crash. The driver’s hands weren’t detected on the wheel for six seconds before the collision, the company said. Tesla said vehicle logs showed the driver took no action despite having five seconds and about 500 feet of unobstructed view of the concrete highway divider.  On Sunday, the NTSB said it needs Tesla to decode the data recorded by the vehicle. “In each of our [past] investigations involving a Tesla vehicle, Tesla has been extremely cooperative on assisting with the vehicle data,” an agency spokesman said. “However, the NTSB is unhappy with the release of investigative information by Tesla.”  Newsletter Sign-up  The NTSB said it would probe all aspects of the crash, including suggestions the driver had expressed previous concerns about Autopilot. It said it would publish a preliminary report on the investigation, likely within a few weeks of completion of field work.  “We’ve been doing a thorough search of our service records and we cannot find anything suggesting that the customer ever complained to Tesla about the performance of Autopilot,” Tesla said in a statement. “There was a concern raised once about navigation not working correctly, but Autopilot’s performance is unrelated to navigation.”  The NTSB probe won’t necessarily lead to sanctions against the electric car company. The NTSB determines probable causes of accidents and makes recommendations to policy makers, but doesn’t issue penalties or take other punitive actions.

Tesla Inc. shares just finished their worst month in more than seven years. Now, options traders are gearing for more turbulence.  A measure of expected volatility in the stock is at the highest its been over the past year, indicating that there could be more gyrations ahead. An options measure called skew–a yardstick of how much its costs to protect against further stock declines–is near a year-long high for Tesla, Trade Alert data show.  The electronic auto maker’s shares fell about 5% on Monday, and options investors have been positioning for extreme moves in the company’s future stock price, Trade Alert data show.  Some of the top open interest positions–or number of options contracts outstanding–pay out if Tesla shares lose almost all of their value by January. The top open interest position on data provider Trade Alert is a bearish put contract that can be exercised if shares hit $50, about 80% below its share price. The last time the stock traded near that level was 2013. Tesla shares closed Monday at $252.48.  Options confer the right, not the obligation, to buy or sell a stock. Investors can tap options contracts to make directional bets or to hedge their portfolio holdings.  Such put contracts can be “some type of disaster insurance because the company is burning through so much cash,” said Fred Ruffy, analyst at Trade Alert, via email.  The electronic auto maker is voluntarily recalling about 123,000 Model S sedans around the world, and the National Transportation Safety Board has also expressed displeasure with Tesla’s recent disclosure that its semiautonomous driving system was activated before a crash last month.  Last week, Moody’s Investors Service downgraded the company, mentioning concerns about its cash levels.  After Tesla had its worst month in more than seven years, Chief Executive Elon Musk posted April Fools’ Day tweets which said the car company had gone bankrupt.  Others may be positioning for a rebound, springing for options tied to a strike price as high as $680, which expire January, Trade Alert data show. Tesla shares have never climbed to that level.  There are signs traders also remain on edge about other hot tech names as regulatory concerns swirl. A group that powered the S&P 500’s rally higher for much of last year has been clobbered recently.  Skew is also nearing a year-long high for Apple, Amazon and Netflix, Trade Alert data show. This could indicate that people are paying up for stock hedges, fearful of a deeper stock slide.  Shares of Amazon.com Inc. and Netflix Inc. fell about 5% on Monday. Apple shares lost 0.7%.

Tesla TSLA 2.13% will soon need money again. The trouble is, raising it suddenly looks a lot more challenging.  Moody’s Investors Service downgraded Tesla’s debt on Tuesday afternoon, citing persistently negative cash flow and continued production issues with the Model 3 mass-market sedan. Moody’s is keeping a negative outlook on the credit due to “the likelihood that Tesla will have to undertake a large, near-term capital raise in order to refund maturing obligations and avoid a liquidity shortfall.”  Tesla’s bonds due in 2025, issued just last summer, were quoted near 90 cents on the dollar after hours. Meanwhile, the stock is down 23% in about a month, making equity more expensive. There are plenty of reasons that Tesla’s magic touch with the capital markets is fading fast.  For starters, Tesla’s financial statements paint an alarming picture of the group’s long-term viability. Tesla had $3.4 billion in cash and equivalents at the end of the year and raised an additional $550 million from bonds backed by lease payments in February. Not all of that is available for spending. Customer deposits, which are mostly refundable, topped $850 million at last count.  Tesla burned more than $3.4 billion last year in free cash, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures. If that pace were to keep up, Tesla would run out of its usable cash before this year ends. Worse still, there is reason to believe the free cash burn figure was understated.  Tesla booked $666.5 million in upfront payments to install solar-energy systems as an investing cash outflow. That normally would be an operating expense, depressing free cash flow. Tesla also has managed to flatter its operating cash flow picture by stretching its working capital. Accounts payable grew by nearly $530 million in 2017 to about $2.4 billion, while accounts receivable grew by just $15 million. The difference generated more than half a billion in cash. That was a smart move to conserve resources, but the trouble is that eventually these suppliers will demand their money. They won’t be comfortable if Tesla can’t meet its forecast production rate of 2,500 Model 3 cars a week by the end of the first quarter.  Newsletter Sign-up  Production issues are only one part of the Model 3 problem, however. The car doesn’t seem to be in as high demand as Chief Executive Elon Musk once promised investors. Analysts at Bernstein said in a research note last week that fewer than 30% of customers who have been invited to take delivery of the Model 3 have actually done so.  And Tesla can’t simply cut spending to solve its cash challenge if it hopes to ramp up production. The company has racked up about $10 billion in long- term debt and has $23 billion in total liabilities. To survive long term, Tesla needs to stop overpromising and to scale back its ambitions to goals it actually can achieve. Right now, though, it just needs more money.  More debt isn’t a practical solution given the current bondholder losses. An equity raise is still possible, but the recent selloff across the tech sector won’t help—nor will the fact that the reality of the Model 3 has so far proven to be much less attractive than the fantasy of yesteryear.  If next week’s delivery update is worse than feared, the odds of keeping the lights on through this year will get a lot longer.

A Tesla Model 3 sedan on display. Its production numbers remain uncertain. Photo: Reuters  Tesla’s first-quarter production figures underscored two things about the maker of electric cars: The company seems to pack lots of activity into the final days of its quarters, and it keeps having trouble meeting its hugely optimistic targets.  Tesla TSLA 2.13% said Tuesday it had produced 2,020 of its Model 3 sedans in the previous seven days. What few noticed is that production for those seven days (which actually extended a bit into the second quarter) amounted to 21% of all the Model 3s Tesla built during the first quarter. That’s well above the level it should have been if production ramped up more gradually during the quarter, as Tesla had predicted it would in January.

https://www.wsj.com/articles/small-tesla-contractor-sues-car-maker-claiming-nonpayment-1523041054
A small Tesla Inc. TSLA 2.13% contractor has sued the auto maker claiming it hasn’t been paid for work at a Fremont, Calif., assembly plant where Tesla is now trying to ramp up production of the Model 3 sedan.  American Integrated Services Inc. claims Tesla hasn’t paid $513,473 for lead and asbestos abatement-related work under a $3.57 million contract signed in January 2016. It filed the lawsuit Tuesday in a California state court in Oakland.  Tesla called the matter “a minor commercial dispute.”  “We paid AIS for all the work we authorized them to do,” a Tesla spokesman said in a statement Friday. “The additional payment they’re seeking is for work that we did not authorize and that clearly was unnecessary. When we asked for documentation showing that Tesla had authorized this unnecessary work, they were unable to provide it.”  The claim comes as the auto maker faces questions about its cash level while it spends heavily to ramp up production of the Model 3, a compact sedan that is designed to turn the electric-car maker from a niche player to one that sells to the masses.  Large automotive suppliers are generally loath to file claims against car makers and can often carry unpaid bills while its customer works to improve its situation, betting there will be future business to win. Small companies, however, can’t always make that bet, or aren’t willing to do so, especially if they don’t expect to do further business with the car company.  Dennis Virag, a manufacturing consultant who has worked in the automotive industry for 40 years, said auto makers generally try to pay vendors quickly unless there is a dispute about the quality or fulfillment of a contract.  The lawsuit claims the contractor had an agreement to be paid within 30 days of receipt of invoices.  “Tesla purchased furnishing lead and asbestos abatement, demolition and removal and other environmental and remediation services, goods, materials, labor, supplies and equipment from on or about Feb. 19, 2017, to present,” the lawsuit said.  A lawyer for American Integrated Services declined to comment, citing ongoing litigation.  Production of the Model 3 began last July and has failed to reach multiple milestones set by Tesla, including one last quarter to make as many as 2,500 sedans in a single week. Tesla on Tuesday worked to reassure investors about its capital needs for the year, saying it was on track to ramp production to around 5,000 Model 3 cars a week in about three months and that would lay the ground work for “strong positive operating cash flow” in the third quarter.  “As a result, Tesla does not require an equity or debt raise this year, apart from standard credit lines,” the company said in the quarterly sales report.  That update followed an April Fools’ Day Twitter post by Chief Executive Elon Musk that joked the company had gone bankrupt and a report from Moody’s Investors Service last week downgrading Tesla’s credit rating, concerned about the company’s cash levels and production delays.  The company finished last year with $3.4 billion in cash on hand after its negative cash flow averaged about $1 billion a quarter on average—a pace analysts have said means the company would need to raise more money this year unless it significantly boosts production.  Tesla has more than $10 billion in debt and its accounts payable has swelled to $2.39 billion at the end of the year from $1.86 billion a year earlier.  Following Tuesday’s assurance that Tesla doesn’t need to raise money, several analysts said they expect the company will do so later this year. Brian Johnson, an analyst for Barclays, wrote in a note to investors that he expected Tesla would need to raise $2.5 billion in the third quarter.  —Andrew Scurria and Lisa Schwartz contributed to this article.
