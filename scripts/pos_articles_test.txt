Apple Inc.’s takeover of music-identification service Shazam may threaten competition and should be reviewed by the European Commission, the regulator said.  Apple will be told to file the transaction to the Brussels-based antitrust authority, who will take over the merger review from Austria, where it was originally declared.  Big technology mergers involving startups with insignificant revenue usually fall through the EU’s usual net for checking whether deals harm competition across the bloc. However, alarmed that it nearly missed Facebook Inc.’s takeover of messaging service WhatsApp, the EU is seeking to change its rules to allow it to take charge of acquisitions where a target company makes no money but holds valuable technology or intellectual property.  Apple announced its purchase of the U.K.-based app in December, for a reported $400 million, according to people familiar with the transaction, which would make it one of Apple’s largest acquisitions. The Shazam app uses the microphone on a smartphone or computer to identify almost any song playing nearby, then points users to places they can listen to it, such as Apple Music or Spotify Ltd.  The acquisition would help Apple embed that capability more deeply into its music offerings. The company’s digital assistant Siri was integrated with Shazam in 2014, so users could ask it what song is playing in the background.  The EU may be worried that once Shazam is under Apple’s control, the iPhone maker could choose to make Apple Music the only option for listening to tracks. That could divert some of the referrals from Shazam that currently go to London-based Spotify. The acquisition also gives Apple access to a large user data base of people’s musical interests.  Apple hasn’t indicated that it plans to make Shazam an exclusive for Apple Music, but in the past the company has sometimes made acquired features compatible only with its products. It also has sometimes kept support for properties it’s bought, for example, when Cupertino, California-based Apple acquired Beats Music to develop Apple Music, Apple released an Android version of the program.  Apple said it would work with the EU on the matter, but declined to provide further detail. The EU took up the review after Austria, Iceland, Italy, France, Norway, Spain and Sweden all asked it to do so.  The EU reviewed and approved the Facebook-WhatsApp deal after several European authorities asked the commission to step in. Facebook was later fined for misleading the EU during the merger probe. It had told the regulators it couldn’t combine WhatsApp data with its other services but moved to do so shortly after the deal was finalized.  — With assistance by Mark Gurman

Two pairs of Beats headphones. The new Apple headphones will have a similar look. Hollis Johnson  Apple is making over-ear headphones, according to a new report.  The accessory will be Apple-branded and focus on audio quality.  Apple is developing a new pair of over-ear headphones, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the KGI Securities analyst with an excellent track record of predicting future Apple products. Apple Insider first found Kuo's report.  Kuo says the headphones will have a new design, but doesn't go into specifics. It sounds like the headphones will be similar to the over-ear headphones Apple makes through its Beats subsidiary. They would also build on the success of AirPods, Apple's wireless earbuds and carry the Apple branding, not Beats branding.  Apple is also likely to focus on audio quality to set the headphones apart from Beats and other similar headphones. They could launch as soon as this year.  Read more details on Apple Insider.

Photo  EAT THE APPLE  A Memoir  By Matt Young  251 pp. Bloomsbury. $26.  The trouble with writing the unvarnished truth in a memoir is that it requires you to be hard not only on others, but also on yourself.  Matt Young’s inventive, unsparing, irreverent and consistently entertaining “Eat the Apple” is that, but it is also a useful corrective to the current idealization of the American soldier — or in this case a Marine. Patriotism and respect for the military is so high in this country that we have lately held a national debate over whether professional athletes should be required to stand for the national anthem. Men and women in uniform are given preference in boarding airplanes, and are so routinely thanked for their service that the expression has become rote. Each new season brings a crop of movies and glossy TV serials dramatizing the heroics of our Special Operations.  Young sees hollowness and potential harm in this.  “Enforcing the idea that every service member is a hero is dangerous,” he writes. “Like creating a generation of veterans who believe everything they did was good.” Young warns of “creating an army of fanatics.”  Service deserves respect, of course, but it does not in itself guarantee stirring and selfless acts of bravery. Young is his own case in point. He sees his experience — three tours in Iraq — as far from heroic. He is at least as disturbed by his duty as he is proud of it. These contradictory feelings are a central theme in his book. Years removed, he both loathes and pines for the man he became in the Marine Corps. What he calls his “Past-me” was a reckless, selfish, cruel and dangerous man.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  “The infantrymen are called grunts and crunchies,” he writes. “They are stupid and intelligent and cruel and beautiful and black and white and brown and yellow and fat and lazy and lithe and godlike and frightening in their dedication to death.”  Photo  It is useful for many reasons to better understand the teenagers we uniform and train and send to war. That way we can better see what happens when they are deployed. Young writes less about war here than about the culture of being a Marine, one of the few and the proud. His memoir — its title, “Eat the Apple,” refers to a vulgar Marine proverb — is in its own way a loving portrait, but it is also unsparing, ugly and outrageous. I can’t see it making the commandant’s reading list.

The new iPad is great tablet for those that want just that: a tablet. It's shorn of the power and performance of the iPad Pro range, but the addition of Apple Pencil compatibility and the A10 chipset bring it pretty close, and for a lot less cash. It irks that you need to buy the Pencil separately to unlock a key feature, and design-wise we're seeing something pretty old-school here… but for the price it's hard to criticize too much, and this is still the best tablet on the market.  The new iPad for 2018 is designed to achieve one thing: deliver the best of Apple’s tablet efforts at a more affordable price.  Note that we say more affordable, rather than cheap – because the cost is still higher than many other tablets out there – but the new upgrades bring a lot to the iPad, bridging the gap between a ‘standard’ slate and the more impressive iPad Pro range.  Support for the Apple Pencil adds another dimension to the tablet, enabling a new method of interaction and bringing with it a slew of new apps to interact with, and the upgraded chipset inside – the same one that powered the iPhone 7 – offers more power than many will know what to do with.  The upshot? You’ve now got a hugely capable tablet, one with more power and offering more possibilities, at a fairly reasonable price point.  You may be thinking that this is a ‘student’s iPad’, as Apple has made a big deal about the new tablet's classroom credentials, but in reality most of the people who buy it will be those who want something to use on the commute and around the house – and as you’ll see, it fares pretty well in those respects.  While this might all sound impressive, it’s still not the full picture, as all these features are combined with the best tablet platform out there, iOS – there’s a reason the iPad has sat atop our best tablet rankings for so long.  The new iPad was launched in March 2018, and comes with a range of storage and connectivity options.  The new iPad 2018 price starts at $329 (£319, AU$469), but schools will get a discount in the UK and US of around 10%.  At $329 (AU$469) the new iPad price is exactly the same as the starting price of the new iPad (2017) – and both come with 32GB of storage – in the US and Australia, while in the UK it looks like consumers are being treated to a discount, as currency fluctuations mean the basic 32GB version is actually £20 cheaper than last year's iPad.  That's for the Wi-Fi only model, with the 32GB slate with cellular connectivity setting you back $459 (£449, AU$669).  The 128GB version begins at $429 / £409 / AU$599 for those who want more storage, with an extra premium to pay if you want some bytes of data floating in on the go.  Apple Pencil  Useful addition for artists  Costs extra to buy  The Apple Pencil… it’s tough to work out whether it’s a genuinely innovative tool or not. We’ve been using it for a few years now, and have found that it’s great for some things, but useless for others.  Also, let’s not forget that it costs £99 / $99 / AU$145, which means you need to pay around 33% of the price of the new iPad, on top of the cost of the slate itself, in order to access the key new feature.  It’s cheaper for those in education, and there is the Logitech Crayon available in the US for half the price (and less functionality), but it’s worth bearing in mind when buying the new iPad.  If you’re looking for something to replace a notepad, we wouldn’t recommend the new iPad – or any iPad for that matter, as it’s really difficult to write legibly on them, thanks to the way the tip of the Pencil glides across the surface.  Apple could make the glass more matte and ridged to help, but that would make the display harder to see, so it’s not an easily solved conundrum.  The Notepad app is fine, and allows you to write and sketch, and now the iWork Suite from Apple is collaborative, and you can mark-up documents on it (it took Apple far too long to enable this feature, with Microsoft inexplicably adding in mark-up functionality first to its iPad apps.  This would be a lovely feature if, as referenced, writing on it was easy; but notes can't simply be jotted, they require concentrated efforts of penmanship… and most of the people we work with are on Google Docs, so sharing a marked-up Pages document was useless.  In a classroom environment it will be more useful if a teacher and the students are all on the same platform… as long as the teacher has immaculate handwriting and patience to write a little slower.  If you’re just underlining sections or pointing to things then the finger is just as good – so maybe make sure you really need the Pencil before forking out all that cash.  However, where the stylus does become worth the outlay is when you want to be artistic – there are a few good apps out there for the Apple Pencil that let you color, change the shading of a photo or get pretty deep into some photo / video manipulation.  We had a great time coloring and sketching during our review, and even if you’re bereft of any kind of talent there’s a lot you can do.  The multi-level pressure of the Pencil comes into its own here, and if you’re in any way artistic then you’ve got loads – and loads, and loads – of different styles of brush, pen and other drawing implements you can work with.  Just note that most of the time you’ll be charging the Pencil by plugging it into the bottom of the iPad… it doesn’t look good.  A10 Fusion chip  Impressive power  Comes with 2GB of RAM  We were all expecting Apple to stick with the same ‘good enough’ A9 chipset from 2017’s iPad and drop the price, but it’s gone up and shoved in the A10 Fusion chip that powered the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, and which is close to the A10X chip in the new iPad Pro range.  That's combined with 2GB of RAM, so there's more than enough power here for nearly any task that most users will want to do with the new iPad, and certainly for emailing, web browsing or watching video.  We noticed some slowdown with heavier apps, for example when processing and opening multiple photos, but we never had to wait too long, and rendering times were still pretty impressive.  That said, if you’re going to do a lot of more demanding work, that’s why Apple has the iPad Pro 10.5 , with the extra power in the CPU and double the RAM.  In our tests, the new iPad (2018) returned a similar single-core benchmarking score to the more powerful iPad Pro 10.5, showing that if you’re not going to be using the cheaper iPad intensively then there’s no reason to spend the extra cash.  It might seem hard to fathom why Apple has thrown in the extra power here, but users will hang onto their iPads for a long, long time (much longer than they would an iPhone), and having more power means they’ll keep running smoothly, and remain upgradeable, for longer.  You’ll be unlikely to use most of the power in the new iPad, to be honest, but the upshot it that it runs incredibly smoothly, and apps open and close with ease… and it’s likely to keep doing that for longer, so you won’t need to upgrade as soon.

When Giannandrea stepped down, initial reports indicated that he would stay at Google in a position that gave him more "hands on" time. It's apparent that he'd either had a change of heart or had planned to jump to Apple for a while. Whatever his reasons, Giannandrea has been crucial to Google in recent years. He ran the efforts to make AI technology central to the company's products. He clearly succeeded -- Assistant is everywhere, and machine learning plays a role in everything from mobile photography to visual search. We'd expect that cross-disciplinary approach to continue at Apple.  Between this, a Siri-related hiring spree and earlier high-profile hires like Carnegie Mellon's Russ Salakhutdinov, one thing is clear: Apple is determined to improve the AI in its products. The company was the first to introduce a modern, conversational AI helper to smartphones with Siri, but that lead quickly eroded as Amazon, Google and Microsoft hopped in. Siri isn't as adept at answering general questions as its rivals, to the point where its limitations became a drawback for the HomePod. Giannandrea might not give Siri directly comparable intelligence (Google has the luxury of its own search engine), but he could close the gap and help Apple keep pace.

On the Advanced Setting screen, flip the button on next to “Save form entries.” After you fill out an address form once, the browser should remember it for the next one and offer to finish entering the information for you.  Photo  AutoComplete is not quite the same thing as the “autofill” function available with some other browsers like Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox (or, for Mac users, Apple’s Safari browser). Instead of offering suggestions to complete web forms, the autofill tool stores address information — and, in some browsers, credit-card numbers as well — and then automatically fills in all the form fields with a click or a keystroke. Third-party programs like Fillr’s AutoFill for Microsoft Edge, Dashlane and RoboForm can supply an autofill function for Microsoft’s browser.  Keep in mind that the personal autofill data stored in a web browser can also be a target for hackers and malicious phishing scripts that can do things like quietly collect the information in web pages with invisible form fields. If you are concerned about online security, you may want to forgo convenience for safety.

Q. Can Windows 10 track how much time a child spends playing games?  A. If the child is using a specially configured Microsoft account, the “family” feature built into Windows 10 can compile reports about how a session was spent — including any games played on the computer or on an Xbox One console. These activity reports are emailed to a parent’s account and list the games and apps used by the child, along with the websites browsed. The keywords used on search engines are also noted — as long as either the Microsoft Edge or Internet Explorer browser was used.  Photo  The Windows 10 parental controls can set limits on a child’s screen time, as well as the types of content available without getting permission. To set up the family options, a parent needs to be signed into a Windows 10 PC with a Microsoft account. The parent then needs to create a separate Microsoft account for the child — and persuade the child to log in and use it.  Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story How Do You Use Tech?

British users are finding it difficult to part with their desktop PC despite the number of 2-in-1 devices available, new research has found.  Despite the growing number of flexible devices such as Microsoft's Surface Pro, many UK users are sticking to their classic desktop, according to a report from online retailer reichelt elektronik.  The firm found that only five per cent of Brits currently own a 2-in-1 device, despite many analyst predictions that the form factor will be the major growth sector in years to come, with 84 per cent saying that had never used such a device.  Classic  Older users were the biggest fans of desktop PCs, with 79 per cent of over 55s still using them, compared to just 45 per cent of millennials.  Tablet usage was also skewed in favour of older users, but it was 35-44 year olds who scored highest, with 52 per cent saying they owned a handheld device, with 60 per cent of all consumers saying they use a tablet more than once a week.  Overall, 39 per cent of Brits own unused desktop PCs, showing that although the devices remain popular with some, their days could be numbered.  “Whilst many people may still own a desktop, they’re gathering dust in the corner of the room as more portable, easy to use devices fit in with modern lifestyles and the need to be able to be connected and access videos, emails and work on the move. Millennials are driving this shift in computing choices," said Frank Gerwarth, product manager at reichelt.  "The time has come to make the switch from traditional desktops to mobile devices that offer the best of both worlds.“

Leaders of Apple Inc., Google and other U.S. technology giants head to China this weekend to pursue a familiar goal: To do more business in the world’s most populous nation. The effort has had mixed results, at best, in the past.  With a trade war brewing between the world’s two largest economies, the goal has gotten loftier still.  Tim Cook, chief executive officer of Apple, Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, and Ginny Rometty, head of IBM, are scheduled to attend the China Development Forum, an annual gathering that helps Western corporations build relationships with the country’s government officials.  Cook is co-chairing the event this year, and Apple has the most at stake in China among U.S. tech companies. Its iPhones and other gadgets have sold well in the country, but revenue from the region fell in Apple’s last fiscal year. The Cupertino, California-based company has also been criticized recently for relocating the data of Chinese iCloud users to state-controlled server farms.  Last year, International Business Machines Corp. announced a deal with Chinese company Wanda Group at the forum. The deal was meant to help IBM expand in the country’s cloud market, though Caixin reported recently that Wanda would stop working with the U.S. company.  Google pulled out of mainland China in 2010 over government censorship of its search results. The company has been trying to return in recent years, but has made little progress.  These hurdles will only get higher if a trade war erupts between the U.S. and China. On Thursday, President Donald Trump ordered 25 percent tariffs on at least $50 billion of Chinese imports, including information and communication technology. He also accused China of stealing intellectual property. China responded with its own duties on some U.S. imports.  Apple could see a negative effect on about 15 percent of its business if China were to retaliate with duties on imports of U.S. products, Loup Ventures’ Gene Munster said in an email earlier on Thursday.  Steve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm’s CEO, will attend the conference but has canceled his plan to speak.  The conference comes just days after Bloomberg News reported that Chinese regulators are seeking more protections for local companies before approving Qualcomm’s proposed purchase of NXP Semiconductors NV. China’s Ministry of Commerce isn’t satisfied with the remedies that Qualcomm has offered so far and has told the company to propose more, people familiar with the matter have said.  China is the world’s biggest market for smartphones and a crucial customer base of Qualcomm’s chips for mobile phones. The San Diego, California-based company won the right to extend its technology licensing business in China in 2015 after paying a fine and agreeing to charge lower rates to local customers on phones for that market.  — With assistance by Mark Bergen, Ian King, and Gerrit De Vynck

Once enabled, this means their business entry on Google Maps or Google Search will display a female symbol captioned “Women led” alongside other attributes, or badges which give users more information at a glance and may include “Has Wi-Fi” or “Free Parking,” for example.  “We strive to organize the world’s information in a way that is inclusive of all peopl  e,” a Google spokesperson told TechCrunch. “Last year, we added an LGBTQ-friendly attribute in time for Pride. This year we’ve added the women-led attribute to empower women-led businesses to succeed online and enable people to find businesses to visit using Google Maps and Search.”  (If you’re wondering how Google ensures businesses that select the “Women led” attribute are actually led by women, business owners can self-identify their gender during Google My Business’ verification process. Business owners must verify their listings before they are able to manage its information on Google Maps, Search and other services.)  As part of its announcement today, Google highlighted three women-led businesses: Progetto Quid in Verona, Italy, a textile company created to give women more employment opportunities; Reaching Out Teahouse in Hoi An, Vietnam, which provides jobs and a support network to people with physical disabilities; and Chicago’s Yogolandia Yogurt & Botana Bar.

Google Wifi is the easiest and most manageable router that we’ve ever set up, period. It might not be the most powerful or offer precise controls, but it more than makes up for any lack of depth in unmatched simplicity.  As devices like Netgear Orbi and Eero have shown: the age of routers and range extenders has ended. The future is tri-band or Wi-Fi mesh systems. And, surprising no one, the smart-home obsessed Google is all over it with the eponymous Google Wifi  And, it turns out that Google may have very well crafted the best Wi-Fi mesh system yet. Google’s managed to create a system that offers more mesh units than competitors at a lower price, and a focus on simple setup and management. The result? We never want to look at another router again.  Price and availability  Unsurprisingly, Google doesn’t ask for a lot of money for what’s on offer. Google Wifi costs $279 (about £197, AU$360) for a set of three units – that’s one primary ‘WiFi Point’ (the one you hook up to the modem or gateway) and two secondary WiFi Points.  In the UK, Google Wifi comes with a two unit set costing £229.  A single Google Wifi unit can be had for $119 (around £84, AU$153). Google promises that three Wifi Points can cover up to 4,500 square feet (418 square meters) in a home.  Unfortunately, at the time of writing, Google has made no mentions of pricing or availability in Australia. However, when we spoke to Google just before the UK launch, it suggested that it was looking to release Google Wifi globally in the future.  Google offers more units for less money than any competitor, like the Netgear Orbi, with all others costing at least $400 (about £320, AU$520) for the same amount.  Spec Sheet Wireless Connectivity: IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, AC1200 2x2 Wave 2 Wi-Fi (expandable mesh; dual-band 2.4GHz and 5GHz, TX beamforming); Bluetooth Smart ready Processor: Quad-core ARM CPU (each core up to 710MHz) Memory: 512MB RAM Storage: 4GB eMMC flash Beamforming: Implicit and Explicit for 2.4 & 5GHz bands Ports: 2 x Gigabit Ethernet ports per Wifi point (1 WAN and 1 LAN port each) Dimensions: 4.1 x 2.7 inches (106.1 x 68.7mm; D x H) each Weight: 12oz (340g) each  Design and setup  Not only does Google have the clear advantage of pricing on its hands, but it also has the best-designed individual units and easiest setup of any offering. Each Google Wifi unit, a tiny, unassuming cylinder with a simple white LED band in its center, is capable of the same functionality.  This means that any of the three units could function as the “router” of the system, while the others can bestow wired internet (which is beamed to the unit wirelessly) with their included Ethernet ports as well as wireless internet. All three units are powered via USB-C.  Setup is as sublime as Google’s hardware design, using a free iOS and Android app to facilitate the process. While we won’t belabor you with the entire procedure, but the app configures your Wi-Fi network by first scanning the QR code on the Wifi Points connected to your modem or gateway and power.  From there, the app tells you to name your network and set a password, then pair the additional Wifi Points and label them in the app for reference. Again, it takes seconds for the “router” to recognize the Wifi Points and for them to begin broadcasting.  But, you’re not going to get the same depth of access as even Netgear Orbi provides, so no band switching for you. However, Google Wifi handles this in the background automatically.  However, the app offers plenty more useful features, like constant monitoring of your network, its Points and the devices connected to it. The app has an included internet speed test similar to that of Ookla’s, a mesh test that measures the health of your Points’ connections as well as a Wi-Fi test that measures your connection strength from within the network.  You can also prioritize bandwidth to one device for a time, control smart home devices and pause internet access to certain devices in a family setting – all from within this app.  By far, this is the most complete and elegant suite of control settings we’ve seen from a Wi-Fi mesh system so far, despite its lack of dropdown boxes and toggles.  Benchmarks Here is how the Google Wifi fared in our brief suite of tests (conducted on a 100Mbps service): Ookla Speed Test 5GHz (Download | Upload): Within 5 feet/1.52 meters; no obstructions: 101.41 | 117.83 Mbps Within 13 feet/3.96 meters; three plaster walls: 97.05 | 118.67 Mbps Ookla Speed Test 2.4GHz (Download | Upload): Within 5 feet/1.52 meters; no obstructions: 47.53 | 96.72 Mbps Within 13 feet/3.96 meters; three plaster walls: 50.95 | 82.98 Mbps 1.5GB Steam download 5GHz (peak speed): Within 5 feet/1.52 meters; no obstructions: 12.6 MB/s Within 13 feet/3.96 meters; three plaster walls: 12.2 MB/s 1.5GB Steam download 2.4GHz (peak speed): Within 5 feet/1.52 meters; no obstructions: 7.2 MB/s Within 13 feet/3.96 meters; three plaster walls: 8.8 MB/s  Performance  We’ve seen just as impressive, if not better, performance from the Google Wifi system as we have Netgear Orbi. Google Wifi draws the absolute most from our 100Mbps Wi-Fi service that we’ve seen any router able to, but can do so from every room of our, albeit small, house.  We’ve been able to stream 4K video through Netflix to our Roku Premiere in the basement as well as we’ve been able to play Overwatch in the office where the modem is located: without issue. Wi-Fi mesh systems like Google Wifi aren’t focused so much about throughput as they are coverage, but this product delivers regardless.  The traffic prioritization feature can ensure that your gaming session is getting more of that crucial bandwidth than the other devices in your house that are Facebooking and streaming HD video.  Plus, the network can automatically repair itself should one or more of the Wifi Points be accidentally unplugged or otherwise lose power.  While we know that Google Wifi operates its mesh system over existing Wi-Fi bands (2.4GHz and 5GHz) over the 802.11s mesh protocol rather than Netgear Orbi’s tri-band system that communicates over a second 5GHz Wi-Fi band, we haven’t found a terrible difference between either’s performance. We do see slightly faster download speeds in MB/s on the 2.4GHz band from the Orbi over the Google Wifi, but that could also be an anomaly.  The true benefit of Google Wifi over others is, simply put, its coverage for the price. You can get equal amounts of coverage in pure square footage from competing systems with fewer units, but the versatility having more units gives you in terms of shoring up dead spots can’t be ignored.  We liked  Google Wifi is incredibly easy to setup and manage on a day-to-day basis despite its lack of some finer control. The fact that the system includes three units for less than some competitors charge for two or fewer is also a huge benefit. Finally, these units look even better in terms of design than systems like Netgear Orbi, and are much easier to hide in plain sight.  We disliked  While there isn’t much to gripe about regarding Google Wifi, some might like finer control over Wi-Fi settings, like controlling which bands are broadcast and when. Also, as it uses AC1200 technology, Google Wifi isn’t capable of the AC3000 or even AC2200 throughput that Netgear Orbi and Linksys Velop are, respectively, which might turn off those paying big for super-fast internet speeds.  Final verdict  Google Wifi is the easiest router that we’ve ever set up, period. And, that’s considering the two extra devices required to complete it. For a relatively affordable price, Google offers more units than most competitors and the best setup and management app by far.  For all of the finer hardware controls it lacks, Google considered every toggle and test it could present in an easily understandable way through its app. (There’s even bandwidth priority control.) Couple that with a hardware design that’s easier to hide in plain sight than any we’ve seen yet, and you’re looking one of the best Wi-Fi systems that money can buy today.  First reviewed April 2017.

"We are not engaging in any dubious practices regarding reviews," the developer writes. "We don't incentivize reviews, we don't review the game ourselves and we don't even tell our friends to review it."  Since the game hit Google Play early this month, it's been downloaded between 10,000 and 50,000 times. Greenheart says the reviews started disappearing slowly at first but within the first week, over a quarter had vanished. Each day after that, the game lost hundreds more. Greenheart hypothesizes that if the algorithm hadn't stepped in, Game Dev Tycoon would have around 3,000 reviews by now. Instead two weeks after it was released, there are around 700 -- just over what the game had on launch day.  The silver lining? Its overall rating hasn't suffered despite these losses. Of those 716 reviews, there are only a pair of one-star scores, and the average score is 4.9. We've reached out to Google for more information and will update this post should it arrive.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc (FB.O) will prioritise “trustworthy” news in its feed of social media posts, using member surveys to identify high-quality outlets and fight sensationalism and misinformation, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said on Friday.  FILE PHOTO: Facebook Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks on stage during the annual Facebook F8 developers conference in San Jose, California, U.S., April 18, 2017. REUTERS/Stephen Lam/File Photo  The company, which has more than 2 billion monthly users, said its members, not experts or Facebook executives, would determine how news outlets rank in terms of trustworthiness. It also said it would put an emphasis on local news sources.  The move is likely to send shockwaves through the media landscape in nearly every country, given the ubiquity of the world’s largest social network and how central it has become in some places to the distribution of news.  Zuckerberg said on Friday he expects recently announced changes to shrink the amount of news on Facebook by 20 percent, to about 4 percent of all content from 5 percent currently.  The chief executive outlined the shakeup in a post on Facebook, saying that starting next week the News Feed, the company’s centrepiece product, would prioritise “high quality news” over less trusted sources.  “There’s too much sensationalism, misinformation and polarization in the world today,” Zuckerberg wrote.  “Social media enables people to spread information faster than ever before, and if we don’t specifically tackle these problems, then we end up amplifying them,” he wrote.  The quality of news on Facebook has been called into question after alleged Russian operatives, for-profit spammers and others spread false reports on the site, including during the 2016 U.S. election campaign.  Two years ago, Facebook users saw hoaxes saying Pope Francis endorsed Republican Donald Trump for U.S. president and that a federal agent investigating Democrat Hillary Clinton was found dead. Facebook initially proposed fighting false stories by letting users flag them.  The change will affect not only links posted by news outlets but also news stories that individuals share, Facebook said.  News organizations immediately began considering how they would fare in the ranking.  FIGHTING FAKE NEWS  The trust ranking will help to address fake news stories, said David Chavern, president of the News Media Alliance, a trade group for old-line U.S. newspapers.  “For some time, we have argued that Facebook should give priority to news from trusted sources,” he said in a statement.  Tom Gara, opinion editor at BuzzFeed News, wrote on Twitter that he expected partisan outlets to fare worse: “This sounds like extremely good news for news publishers that aren’t hated by one side or the other.”  Facebook has had a stormy relationship with news organizations, especially those with strong political leanings. In 2016, Republican U.S. lawmakers expressed concern that Facebook, based in liberal Northern California, was suppressing news stories of interest to conservative readers.  Facebook said that ranking by trustworthiness was not intended to directly impact any specific groups of publishers based on their size or ideology.  Zuckerberg said he settled on the idea of surveying Facebook users after rejecting having the company itself rank news outlets’ trustworthiness.  “We decided that having the community determine which sources are broadly trusted would be most objective,” he wrote in his post.  Facebook said it did not plan to release the survey results because they will represent an incomplete picture of how a story’s position in a person’s feed is determined.  Many factors determine where a post appears in a Facebook user’s News Feed such as subject of the post, who wrote it and who is commenting on it.  Last week, Zuckerberg said the company would change the way it filters posts and videos on News Feed to prioritise what friends and family share.  News Corp (NWSA.O), owner of the New York Post and other outlets, responded to the earlier Facebook announcement with a pledge to look for “any signs that the weighting of news sites is politically motivated.”  The Rupert Murdoch-led company had no immediate comment on Friday.

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen called a rival “crazy and stupid” on Tuesday over his petition to try to get Facebook to release details of the way the Southeast Asian country’s ruler has used social media.  Cambodia's Prime Minister Hun Sen waves upon his arrival at Air Force Station Palam in New Delhi, India, January 24, 2018. REUTERS/Adnan Abidi  Former opposition leader Sam Rainsy’s legal team filed the lawsuit in California last week, saying that Hun Sen was using the platform to commit human rights abuses and deceive the electorate.  Among other allegations was that Hun Sen was paying for false Facebook “likes” to mislead voters about his support.  “This person is crazy and stupid,” Hun Sen told thousands of university graduates in the capital Phnom Penh, saying Rainsy was just jealous because his official Facebook page had 9.4 million “likes” to only 4.5 million for Sam Rainsy’s.  Hun Sen said he had no idea who had liked his own page.  The case has drawn attention to the central role of Facebook in political discussion in Cambodia, where the government has shut the main opposition party, arrested its leader and cracked down on media and civil rights groups over the past year.  A 29-year-old man was ordered to pre-trial detention on Monday over comments posted on Facebook, which included calling the government “authoritarian.” He was arrested last week on his wedding day.  Sam Rainsy’s petition against Facebook said the platform had been used by the government to make death threats and alleged that state money had been spent in advertising on Facebook, where Hun Sen’s backers have built a strong presence.  Facebook’s public relations department has not responded to Reuters requests for comment on the case.  Sam Rainsy lives in France, where he fled in 2015 after a conviction for defamation that he says was politically motivated. He did not respond immediately to Hun Sen’s comments on Tuesday.

Facebook Inc. reached a deal with Major League Baseball for exclusive rights to stream 25 afternoon games on the social network in the U.S.  It’s the first time a major U.S. league has agreed to show regular season games exclusively on Facebook, which has been building a portfolio of live sports. MLB owners unanimously approved the move, the league said. Neither MLB nor Facebook disclosed the financial terms, though people with knowledge of the matter put the price at $30 million to $35 million. They asked not to be identified because the terms are private.  “Much like the migration of sports from broadcast to cable, you’re reaching these milestones where the combination of the financial incentive and the audience allow you to make the next great leap,” said Lee Berke, an industry consultant. “This is part of the next great leap.”  The games add to Facebook’s growing sports lineup. Last year, the company struck deals with Fox Sports to stream the UEFA Champions League and with Univision to broadcast live games from Mexico’s top soccer league. The company also had 20 non-exclusive MLB games last season and acquired exclusive rights to stream 47 college basketball games involving smaller conferences this year.  With 1.4 billion active daily users, the world’s biggest social network is also still growing, in contrast with conventional TV networks that have been losing viewers and advertising. Facebook’s ad revenue last year totaled $40 billion.  Weekday Afternoons  All of the games will take place on weekday afternoons, primarily Wednesdays. The agreement begins with the April 4 game between the Philadelphia Phillies and New York Mets. Viewers will be able to watch on smartphones, tablets, computers and other connected devices, including home TVs.  The games will be produced by the MLB Network, meaning they’ll have a broadcast look and feel. For Facebook, however, the rights allow for experimentation with things like social integration and graphics during the broadcast, enhancements popular with younger viewers drawn to digital platforms.  Facebook will also have rights to show the baseball games globally, though they won’t be exclusive outside the U.S. MLB and Facebook will update the schedule on a monthly basis.  MLB will produce and distribute specially curated content, in addition to each live game broadcast, including on-demand highlight packages for every regular season game, as well as club-specific weekly recap packages for all 30 MLB teams. These will be available on Facebook Watch in the U.S. and around the world.  Football Rights  Earlier this year, Facebook opted against bidding for the National Football League’s Thursday Night package, which Amazon.com Inc. carried last season. Facebook had bid the previous two years. The company did acquire the rights to NFL recaps and highlights, giving the league a way to reach fans on the social media service.  Facebook offered $600 million for the rights to an Indian cricket league, losing out to Fox, and has been boosting its budget for content, including live sports and original shows.  — With assistance by Gerry Smith

Landing a Facebook job isn't just about your degree or who you know. Glassdoor  • Facebook jobs might seem unattainable, but you should still apply.  • That's VP of HR Janelle Gale's advice for prospective candidates.  • Facebook isn't looking for people with inside connections or educations from top schools, she said.  • Gale said they're mostly looking for people who are going to be able to bring a lot of passion into their roles.  Jobs at Facebook require a killer application. But that doesn't mean you should immediately disqualify yourself.  The tech giant recently topped Glassdoor's 2018 Employees' Choice Awards, and a whopping 94% of Facebook employees who've left reviews on Glassdoor would recommend the company to a friend. That's why Facebook VP of HR Janelle Gale is set to address how the company keeps its employees happy and engaged at Glassdoor's Best Places to Work Tour.  Gale said job candidates with an interest in Facebook shouldn't second guess themselves. Instead, you should just find a role that you know you'd truly enjoy, and apply. It's as simple as that.  "Make sure that's the central part of your story, because we're looking for the thing you enjoy," she told Business Insider. "We may ask you, 'Tell us about a time when time flew for you when you were working on a project?' because that is a signal for us. That is work you are going to be good at because you enjoy it."  She also cleared up two major misconceptions about landing a job at Facebook:

Q. I often get interrupted by little pop-up windows showing comments from friends when I’m using Facebook on my computer. I looked in the notification settings for a place to turn off the pop-ups, but didn’t see anything. Am I stuck with these annoyances?  A. Unlike the simple notification alerts that appear quickly and disappear, those windows that rise up from the lower part of the window when you are browsing Facebook are intended to keep you in the loop when your friends comment and start a conversation on a post you have made. (Facebook does not pop up windows for every conversation connected to your posts, but concentrates on the conversations it has determined you might care about the most.) The pop-up windows are more immediate than email notifications about comments on your posts. If you dislike the alerts, you can turn them off — but not in the main Facebook settings.

Like Mark Zuckerberg, Doctor Frankenstein was a good guy whose experiment just got out of hand. Now the mobs are howling after Facebook , Mr. Zuckerberg’s creature.  It is true that Facebook’s release of personal “friend data” into the ozone through Cambridge Analytica remains in the news only because of the prevailing superstition that the Facebook monster allowed Donald Trump to be elected president. The idea that omnipotent technology manipulated the 2016 election has greater appeal to advanced progressive thinking than Hillary Clinton’s explanation that married white women sold her out.  But really, all that is a sideshow. The backlash against this technology, the belief that the creature must be controlled, has been building for several years. Along with Google, Facebook is the biggest web target, so Mark Zuckerberg is about to get torched by Congress and any regulator within reach for abusing “data.”  Data is the oxygen of the internet. Any online click for any reason inputs data. In the beginning this data, organized into things like family Facebook groups or Google Maps or Wikipedia, was seen as good.  For several years BTTP—BTTP being human history Before The Trump Presidency —articles and books poured forth describing the dark side of this technology. In the past year, that criticism has reached critical mass.  Researchers and parents agree that social media is distorting the lives of young people, especially adolescent girls. No one knows what to do about it.  Web forums fill with millions of young men exchanging sexual and political rants. No one knows what to do about it.  Terrorists wallow in jihadist videos on YouTube, brainwashing themselves into acts of mass murder. No one knows what to do about it.  People write articles saying they have forgotten how to read books.  Major advertisers accuse social-media companies of allowing their ads to appear alongside pornography, a bog beyond anyone’s control.  The cyberwarfare spies of Russia’s Internet Research Agency ran around the U.S. uncaught for years.  Social media’s contribution to the Arab Spring and Ukraine’s Orange Revolution was an era ago. The technology has been captured since by dictators who use it as an instrument of surveillance and control that would startle Philip K. Dick.  In one week, Facebook the good communitarian has become Facebook the abuser of everyone’s privacy.  The story of Frankenstein endures as a metaphor of good intentions gone haywire because it keeps happening. Some people used to argue that because Albert Einstein explained how energy could be released from atoms, he bore responsibility for the atomic bomb. By this logic blame should fall on Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, for electing Donald Trump.  Do not for a moment think that Mr. Zuckerberg, Mr. Berners-Lee or any of the others who created modern life online are unaware that history may conclude their creations were a mistake.  Mr. Berners-Lee, reacting to the Facebook mess, accused social-media companies of abusing his creation: “The fact that power is concentrated among so few companies has made it possible to weaponize the web at scale.”  “Weaponize” evokes the idea of dual-use technology, which is tech that can be put to both a peaceful and military purpose, such as rocket guidance systems. The internet has finally been recognized as a dual-use technology, good and bad.  Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO and inheritor of Steve Jobs’s creations, weighed in this week, ironically from China, the global leader in Orwellian surveillance systems. “The ability of anyone to know what you’ve been browsing about for years,” said Mr. Cook, “who your contacts are, who their contacts are, things you like and dislike and every intimate detail of your life—from my own point of view it shouldn’t exist.” Of course, the iPhone became the universal gateway into this dystopia.  One can imagine that when Sergey Brin and Larry Page created Google’s early motto, “Don’t Be Evil,” they sensed what Robert Oppenheimer and his colleagues on the Manhattan Project knew: The power of what they had created might be a problem.  Back when superstition ruled the world, the solution to a larger-than-life problem was known as forcing the genie back into the bottle. Today, when algorithms rule the world, one would think that an industry with aggregate IQ greater than any ever assembled could figure this out. But maybe IQ correlates with the problem.  If the issue is privacy, why does every app and site incentivize users to scroll past pages of legal boilerplate to hit “I Agree,” rather than writing up top in large type: “THIS IS THE ONE SENTENCE YOU’VE GOTTA THINK ABOUT BEFORE YOU AGREE”?  There is another alternative to trying to dam up the internet torrent with regulation: Every time anyone clicks into an app or search engine, they should see this more needed personal motto for our times: Don’t Be Stupid.

Tesla’s Model 3 production “hell” continues.  Elon Musk, in a testy Twitter exchange, said he is “back to sleeping at the factory” while trying to fix production delays with the Model 3 electric car. It’s a move reminiscent of Tesla’s last vehicle launch—the Model X—when Musk famously kept a sleeping bag near the production line so he could immediately address any hiccups.  “Car biz is hell,” Musk said.  The posts on Twitter came as investors await Tesla’s first-quarter production numbers, which are expected to fall short of company forecasts. The exchange, with a reporter at the Information, a tech and business news site, followed a story by the outlet that Musk had taken over Model 3 production from Tesla’s head of engineering, Doug Field.  For the past year, Field has managed engineering of both the vehicle and its production. Musk said Field had originally been tasked with both jobs to ensure Tesla doesn’t design cars that are “crazy hard to build,” but now that the company was back in the thick of production, “it’s better to divide and conquer.”  Tesla Inc. is under enormous pressure to build the Model 3 fast enough to meet customer demand—and to bring in revenue to offset billions of dollars spent preparing for its rollout. An experimental tracking model developed by Bloomberg estimates that Tesla was able to produce 9,285 Model 3s for the quarter and achieved a final burst of production of as many as 2,200 cars a week. Musk had vowed to reach 2,500 a week by the end of the first quarter—a target that was already scaled back from a prior forecast of 5,000 a week by the end of 2017.  See more about the Bloomberg Model 3 Tracker here.  Tesla has built up a die-hard fan base, with some half a million people putting down $1,000 reservations for the Model 3 since it was unveiled two years ago. But the company is still trying to prove it has what it takes to be a true mass-production company. Tesla reports production and delivery results within a few days of each quarter ending.  When Tesla rolled out the Model X in late 2015, it was years behind schedule, and production was marred by problems with its complicated falcon wing doors, custom mono-post rear seats and other unique new high-tech features. Musk told investors in 2016 that he kept a sleeping bag on hand and moved his desk to wherever the factory problems were most troublesome.  It’s not clear where Tesla’s current bottlenecks reside. During a first-quarter earnings call, Musk said the primary holdup was with robots at the company’s battery Gigafactory near Reno, Nevada. A new production line had been built for it at Tesla’s Grohmann Automation labs in Germany and was scheduled to be installed at the Gigafactory last month. If Musk is instead camping out at the automaker’s Fremont, California, car factory, that would suggest his attention has shifted away from the batteries to car assembly. Tesla wants to double production in the next three months, to 5,000 cars a week. Fremont is where that will, or won’t, happen.  Even if Tesla reaches its first-quarter production target, it’s not clear whether the company will be able to sustain and build off of it. According to Musk’s latest posts on Twitter, the company hasn’t emerged from production hell just yet.  See the final estimates from Bloomberg’s Model 3 Production Tracker.

“You have to have a finished car rolling off the line every couple of minutes,” said Mark Wakefield, global co-head of automotive and industrial at AlixPartners, a consulting firm. “And each one has maybe 5,000 parts that come from different suppliers and have to arrive just in time, and each car is available in a couple of thousand build combinations with different colors and features. And all this has to happen at a competitive cost. There’s a lot that can trip you up.”  Even as he introduced the Model 3 at an event last summer, Mr. Musk warned that the company would find itself in “production hell” — and as those words proved prescient, he has had to repeatedly dial back his forecasts for how many Tesla could churn out.  Mr. Musk once envisioned producing as many as 500,000 cars this year, and last summer he was hoping to be able to make 20,000 Model 3s a month by December. More recently, Tesla had aimed to produce at least 2,500 Model 3s per week by the end of the first quarter.  But that is more than it managed in the entire fourth quarter, and it has produced fewer than 10,000 in the first quarter, the company said Tuesday.  There have been signs of momentum, however. In the past seven days, Tesla said, it had produced 2,020 Model 3s, a rate it said it expected to sustain in the coming week.  In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Tesla said it expected its output to “climb rapidly” through the second quarter and reach 5,000 per week in about three months. It added that it was “rapidly addressing production and supply-chain bottlenecks, including several short factory shutdowns to upgrade equipment.”  Tesla has closely guarded the details of its manufacturing system, but Mr. Musk has described it as highly automated.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Ron Harbour, a partner and auto-manufacturing specialist at Oliver Wyman, a consulting firm, said that adding more automated equipment tends to create a more complex production environment. “You have more new equipment to launch, there’s more programming, more maintenance,” he said. “More automation doesn’t necessarily make it more efficient.”  The highest-volume plants he’s seen, Mr. Harbour added, often have more assembly workers and fewer robots. “It’s a little counterintuitive, but that’s how it is,” he said.

With a starting price of $35,000, the Model 3 is more affordable than Tesla’s other models and a crucial part of its ambitions to become a mass-market automaker — as well as to stabilize its finances and turn a profit.  But Mr. Wakefield noted that working out bottlenecks and hitches in auto production often isn’t as straightforward as it could appear. For example, modifying one part to make it fit better or stronger can require other parts to be modified, or can alter the car’s driving characteristics.  “If you make a change to solve one problem, you can create five other problems,” he said. “People think you just find a problem and solve it, but it’s not like that. There are literally millions of problems that come up and require thousands of engineers, working in teams, either at the car company or the suppliers, to deal with.”  While Tesla scrambled to work out the kinks in making the Model 3 in the first quarter, deliveries of the Model S and Model X declined by 23 percent from the previous quarter — to 21,800 — even as the company reported “the most productive quarter in Tesla history.”  Tesla said it had been hurt by a shortage of battery packs for its cars, made at the plant it calls the Gigafactory, near Reno, Nev.  Michelle Krebs, a senior analyst at Autotrader.com, said the decline in deliveries of the Model S and Model X might suggest that the allure of Tesla vehicles has somewhat faded. Electric cars make up fewer than 1 percent of all vehicles sold in the United States.  “You just wonder if there’s enough growth in electric vehicles,” she said. “At first everybody who wanted a Tesla and could afford a Tesla hopped on. But it’s not the newest thing anymore.”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  In its statement on Tuesday, the company said that “demand remains strong” for the Model S and Model X. But a sustained slump in sales of those vehicles could complicate Tesla’s efforts to trim the losses it has been reporting every three months — including a net loss of $771 million in the fourth quarter.  Even aside from its production struggles with the Model 3, the company has been hit by a barrage of negative news in recent weeks.  Concern has grown over the safety of Autopilot, its driver-assistance system, after a fatal crash on March 23 that occurred while the system was engaged. It was at least the third fatal crash that has taken place while a driver was using Autopilot.  On Friday, Tesla said the driver had not heeded several visual and audible warnings to put his hands on the steering wheel before his Model X hit a concrete barrier. Neither the driver nor the car appeared to activate the brakes before impact.  Also last week, Moody’s Investors Service downgraded Tesla’s credit rating and said the company risked running short of cash by the end of the year.  The company said Tuesday that it saw no need to take special measures this year to raise cash. Its shares closed up 6 percent on Tuesday after the regulatory filing, but they have still shed 23 percent of their value in barely three weeks.

====================================
Despite this wave of negative publicity, it seems clear that Tesla will rise or fall based on the performance, safety, design and value of its cars. If it gets those things right, all the other issues will sort themselves out. Tesla has already defied skeptics and attracted legions of die-hard fans by surmounting seemingly impossible odds to build all-electric cars that have drawn lavish praise from automotive critics.  That includes the Model 3, which Popular Mechanics named its 2018 Car of the Year. (It was a finalist for Motor Trend’s similar award. That it lost out to the Alfa Romeo Giulia has drawn howls of online protest.)  When my Model 3 test vehicle pulled up to the curb on Eighth Avenue, it didn’t quite stop pedestrian traffic the way opening the gull-wing doors on the Model X had, but I could see why the automotive press is so excited. The interior features a single slab of wood sweeping around the cockpit interrupted only by a touch-screen interface that houses nearly all the controls, many of them voice activated.  With its Zen minimalism, it doesn’t look or feel like any other car I’ve been in. The synthetic-leather seats are comfortable, and there’s ample room for someone my size (6-foot-3). This all comes at a cost: $57,500 for this luxurious long-range version, far from the $35,000 base price that has excited many potential Tesla buyers.  The Model 3 may not have the rocketlike acceleration of the X, but I found it nimble and responsive. I easily accelerated from a full stop into traffic flowing at highway speed, usually a nerve-racking maneuver in a conventional car. Driving the Model 3 was such a pleasure I was reluctant to cede any control to Autopilot.  For someone with decades of experience driving a conventional car, my first taste of semiautonomous driving last fall had come as a shock. The sensation of a vehicle moving on its own was so bizarre that I instinctively gripped the steering wheel, which immediately transferred control back to me.  This time I was more relaxed, willing to see how the car would behave. I gave the voice-activated navigation system a destination (Garden State Plaza, a New Jersey shopping mall about 20 miles away), and the car accelerated, braked, stayed in the center of the lane and maintained a comfortable three-car distance ahead of me, all without my intervention. At the mall, it detected an empty parking place, and flawlessly backed into it.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  One of its most impressive features is the ability for the driver to change lanes simply by pressing the turn-signal lever. The Tesla scans for traffic in the adjacent lane, waits for an opening and then glides into place, eliminating the danger of a blind spot.

Although I’d been briefed on its limitations, so successful was Autopilot that I was tempted to let down my guard by not bothering to look in the rearview mirror. That would have been a mistake.  For all its vision capabilities (including in darkness), Autopilot became confused when lanes weren’t clearly marked or split in two or at exit ramps. You can’t simply program the destination and let the car find its way. It’s reassuringly cautious about changing lanes, but in heavy traffic, I would have missed an exit while waiting for it to find a suitable opening, and had to assert manual control.  While heading south on the New Jersey Turnpike, I could see in the rearview mirror a BMW bearing down at high speed. I pushed the turn signal for a lane change, and despite its ultrasonic sensors, the Tesla seemed oblivious to the onrushing car. It started to move into its lane; the driver laid on his horn, and I had to grab control to avoid an accident.  Blog posts indicate that other drivers have experienced the same issue.  The Tesla owner’s manual describes this situation as one that the system can’t yet manage. Tesla said it expected future upgrades to solve the problem, but for now, drivers need to be as attentive to the rearview mirror as with any other car.  Tesla had no comment for this column.  At this juncture, Autopilot is a misnomer, as many others have observed. “This is not self-driving technology,” said Bryan Reimer, a research scientist and expert on autonomous vehicle technology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “It’s a collaborative system that leaves responsibility for safety in the drivers’ hands and isn’t intended to let them sit in the back seat or pursue other activities while driving.” Even though some companies have said they plan driverless ride services in as little as two years, Mr. Reimer said full automation was likely to be many years or even decades in the future.  Self-driving automation systems are ranked from zero (no automation) to 5 (full automation). Tesla’s Autopilot is Level 2. It requires drivers to keep at least one hand on the wheel. The car issues a prompt if it doesn’t detect a hand on the wheel, and Autopilot shuts down if there’s no response. In the Mountain View accident, Tesla has said, the driver “received several visual and one audible hands-on warning,” but “the driver’s hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds prior to the collision.”  Given that this was my first extended drive using Autopilot, I was hypervigilant, maybe even more so than in a conventional car. I’m told that wears off in time, as using Autopilot becomes second nature. The risk is that complacency contributes to driver inattention. Mr. Reimer and other experts are conducting research into the issue.  “As technology supplants human performance,” Mr. Reimer said, “the bigger question is how safe is safe enough. If lane-changing technology is 50 percent more effective than humans, is that good enough? That’s the big question no one wants to answer.”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  At the same time, he said, he worries that “intense media coverage of accidents like Mountain View will scare people off.” He said it was too soon to draw any conclusions from that fatality, but noted that Tesla’s excellent safety record over the many millions of miles its cars have now traveled suggested that using Autopilot “can’t be substantially more risky than conventional controls.” (There were more than 40,000 traffic fatalities in the United States last year.)  After investigating a fatal 2016 crash involving a Tesla S and a tractor-trailer in Florida, the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration found no flaws in the Autopilot system. The National Transportation Safety Board concluded that Autopilot had performed as intended, but that the driver had become overly reliant on the technology.  After my drive in the Model 3, my sense is that even with its flaws, Tesla’s Autopilot is a vast improvement over conventional controls, and enhances (rather than supplants) the driving experience. I’m tempted to join the Model 3 waiting list, which numbers over 400,000 customers.  Investors, too, seem to have reassessed Tesla’s recent bad news. This past week, Tesla said it had succeeded in ramping up production of the Model 3, though it still fell short of targets, and had adequate capital for the rest of the year. From Monday morning through the end of trading Thursday, Tesla shares jumped more than 24 percent.

NEW YORK — Wall Street shares plunged on Monday as investors fled technology stocks amid resurgent trade war worries, with key indexes trading below their 200-day moving averages and the S&P 500 closing below that pivotal technical level for the first time since Britain's vote to leave the European Union in June 2016.  The first trading day of the second quarter began with a broad selloff concentrated in the technology and consumer discretionary sectors, as losses by Amazon.com, Tesla and Microsoft, among others, took center stage from retaliatory trade measures China unveiled on Sunday.  With the S&P 500 in a 10 percent correction from its record high in late January, investors were increasingly concerned a nine-year bull market might be in danger of ending.  "It’s more complicated than just a tech selloff. What's hurting everything is that the S&P went through its 200-day moving average," said Brian Battle, director of trading at Performance Trust Capital Partners in Chicago. "That attracts momentum sellers and they don't care what the fundamentals are."

Using the new controls is pretty simple. When in Traffic-Aware Cruise Control mode, you just roll the right-hand scroll button up or down to adjust your speed. To change the distance between you and the car ahead, push the right button to the left or the right. "You can still adjust these settings from the touchscreen and press down on the button to activate voice commands," Tesla adds in the 2018.12 update notes.  Engadget's Roberto Baldwin specifically complained about the lack of physical adjustments for cruise speed and follow distance. "On the Model 3 you have to tap the display to adjust the cruise control speed," he noted. "Even worse, you have to go into a submenu to adjust the adaptive cruise control follow distance." That not only removes driver attention from the road, but makes it easy to tap the wrong function if there's a bump in the road.  The new software also addresses another of our complaints, letting you adjust the side mirrors using those same buttons (though you first have to select the items from the screen). All of those things are crucial on the road, so Tesla seems to be focusing on safety first while adding physical control functionality.  As we also noted in our review, Tesla's unique ability to add new functionality via software updates can completely change an EV's utility over the course of months or years. That especially applies to the Model 3, which depends more on technology than the other models.

(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc is cutting hundreds of jobs in its consumer business in Seattle, a person familiar with the matter said on Monday, as the company shifts resources into fast-growing areas like its work on voice assistant Alexa.  People walk by the main entrance of the Amazon Spheres at Amazon's Seattle headquarters in Seattle, Washington, U.S., January 29, 2018. REUTERS/Lindsey Wasson/Files  The job cuts, rare for the world’s largest online retailer, are in the low hundreds, the person said on condition of anonymity. Amazon determined through planning for 2018 that certain mature areas of its business no longer required as much staff for the results it was seeking, the person said.  It was unclear which specific teams inside Amazon were affected. Amazon’s consumer organization includes its retail and marketplace businesses, as well as programs like food delivery service Amazon Restaurants.  Seattle-based Amazon has been on a hiring tear, creating some 130,000 jobs worldwide in 2017 and announcing plans to open a second headquarters in North America, anticipating up to 50,000 more jobs there. Its full-time and part-time headcount surged 66 percent in the fourth quarter to 566,000 from a year earlier. That figure includes employees at Whole Foods Market, which Amazon acquired in a $13.7 billion deal last year.  But many of the corporate jobs are going to areas of soaring profit, like cloud-computing division Amazon Web Services, or areas where Amazon sees potential, like voice-controlled computing.  “Our 2017 projections for Alexa were very optimistic, and we far exceeded them,” said Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder and chief executive, in a statement earlier this month. “We don’t see positive surprises of this magnitude very often — expect us to double down.”  Amazon hopes Alexa will become a regular part of consumers’ lives and will spur shopping orders by voice.  The company currently has 3,900 jobs open in Seattle, and staff facing job cuts can apply for them. The company has contracts for 1 million square feet or more of new office space in the city to hire still more employees.  The Seattle Times earlier reported the job cuts.

Last week Amazon.com Inc. bought the Santa Monica, California-based smart home equipment maker Ring for an estimated $1 billion in cash. Though filled with less import than the company’s $13.4 billion acquisition of Whole Foods Market last year, the deal was the second-largest in Amazon’s history. And like all acquisitions, it gives us a rare glimpse into the way Jeff Bezos sees the future.  In the short term, Ring gives Amazon another piece in its Alexa puzzle and a leg up in its race against Google and Apple to control homes that will increasingly be filled with connected appliances. Alexa is a nice novelty now, great for serving up the weather, reading the news and hosting the occasional trivia game. But it will be really useful when it’s the hub that lets people use their voice to arm their security systems, open locked doors and flash video of the person who’s ringing the doorbell out front. Google understands this as well; the new $229 Nest doorbell will come with a free Google Home Mini when it starts shipping this spring.  Alexa currently works with a host of third-party smart home products. But owning Ring’s varied assortment of video doorbells, security cameras and accessories allows Amazon to accelerate their development and make them exclusive to Alexa. (It bought a similar company, Blink, last year.) Amazon can also do the typical Amazon thing and lower prices, probably by incorporating the optional subscription plans for keeping recorded video into the soup of benefits that is a Prime membership.  There’s also a medium-term benefit to adding Ring. Package theft, a.k.a. “porch pirates,” is a rampant problem in much of the country, one that has required Amazon delivery people to start emailing customers photographs of packages left by the front door, and which, in the past, has forced the company to restrict same-day delivery from neighborhoods with high crime rates. Last year, Amazon introduced a home camera and a service called Amazon Key, which automatically opens doors for verified delivery people. Amazon Key works with so-called “smart locks” made by other companies. Ring doesn’t sell door locks just yet, but you can imagine a day when Amazon owns all the components to make such a service work.  The implications of the Amazon-Ring deal are really interesting to contemplate when we start thinking farther out. We know Amazon wants to deliver groceries. But leaving bags of kale and cartons of milk outside for hours doesn’t work, and many Amazon Fresh subscribers aren’t crazy about accumulating those bulky blue totes filled with dry ice. When Amazon is behind your home security system, your doorbells and door locks, Amazon workers will be able to walk in, unpack the bags and bring the milk right to the refrigerator.  But why stop with groceries? With its endless appetites, Amazon wants to expand in the massive home-services category, fertile ground for companies like Handy Technologies Inc. and Thumbtack Inc. Imagine sitting at school or in your office and being able to buzz in the cable guy or a plumber after verifying they are who they say they are with live video on your phone. Or we can go even further: The Amazon front door and security system could one day open for your trusted housekeeper, dog-walker or exterminator, and no one else.  To keep growing at 30 percent a year, Amazon has to start selling us services, not just stuff. The Ring acquisition, with its smart doorbells and security cameras, is another step along that path. Rivals should beware: Amazon’s move into smart home devices is going to give all new meaning to the words “lock in.”  This article also ran in Bloomberg Technology’s Fully Charged newsletter.

Amazon has renewed Lore for a second season, bringing on Sean Crouch (from The Exorcist and Numb3rs) as showrunner.  Lore is an anthology series focused on the supernatural, adopted from the Lore podcast by Aaron Mahnke.  The first season of Lore came out last year, using dramatic scenes, animation, narration and docu-style scenes to root the supernatural in truth. Executive producers include Ben Silverman (The Office), Howard T. Owens (Killing Kennedy), Gale Anne Hurd (The Walking Dead), Brett-Patrick Jenkins (Face Off), and Jon Halperin and Mark Mannucci (A Year in Space).  Silverman and Owens said in a prepared statement that season two will explore “global, real-life horror stories that make this series unlike anything on television,” and that the upcoming season will be “scarier than ever.”  Amazon has been taking a slightly more focused approach to original programming, renewing a handful of series for a second season in the past few months, including The Tick and Sneaky Pete.  The show will begin shooting in April, but there’s no word on when Lore Season 2 will go live on the Amazon Prime Video platform.

KERNERSVILLE, N.C. — As soon as the first robot arrived at a FedEx shipping hub in the heart of North Carolina tobacco country early last year, talk of pink slips was in the air.  Workers had been driving the “tuggers” that navigated large and irregular items across the vast concrete floor of the 630,000-square-foot freight depot since it opened in 2011.  Their initial robotic colleague drew a three-dimensional digital map of the place as it tugged freight around. A few months later, three other robots — nicknamed Lucky, Dusty and Ned in a nod to the movie “¡Three Amigos!” — arrived, using the digital map to get around on their own.  By March, they were joined by two others, Jefe and El Guapo. Horns honking and warning lights flashing, the autonomous vehicles snaked through the hub, next to about 20 tuggers that still needed humans behind the wheel.

Cryptocurrency, once strictly the domain of techies, has grabbed mainstream attention due to the skyrocketing values of the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum, two of the more popular virtual currencies.  At the heart of these digital currencies is the technology of the blockchain, which dates back to 2008. This is distributed ledger tech that provides a decentralized and transparent method for transactions, while maintaining a high level of security.  To date, the most successful application of the blockchain has been in cryptocurrency. However, this same technology will certainly make itself felt across a variety of other sectors – which should brace themselves for the impending disruption. In this article, we’re highlighting 10 such arenas that will certainly feel the impact of the blockchain…  Check out how Microsoft is making a blockchain that’s fit for business  1. Voting  A limitation to modern elections is that they require the voter to be physically present at the polling booth to cast their vote, which can often make things awkward in terms of finding the time to travel – and makes little sense in our mobile, connected society. Another bone of contention is the possibility of voter fraud, with losing candidates potentially engaging in legal battles which can delay the result, and even cost the taxpayer when it comes to conducting a recount.  The application of blockchain technology could eliminate voter fraud, providing a clear record of the votes cast, and preventing any chance of a rigged election. Furthermore, this could all be done on a mobile platform, allowing busy individuals the opportunity to cast their vote without going to a polling station. Follow My Vote promises an ‘online voting solution for the modern age’ via blockchain technology.  2. Healthcare  While healthcare has mostly moved on from paper-based records, it’s still an industry which is ripe for modernization via the blockchain. Current challenges in this sector include keeping patient records private from hackers, while allowing authorized access by providers.  Applying blockchain technology to healthcare records promises improved data security, with better access for healthcare professionals and patients alike, and greater transparency for healthcare transactions. Gem has partnered with healthcare tech firm Philips in this space.  3. Photography  Photographers can face challenges when it comes to getting paid royalties for their snaps, especially in our digital world where image theft is often just a click away.  With that in mind, at the recent CES show in Las Vegas, Kodak revealed its new digital currency, KODAKCoin, which is backed by a blockchain ledger and image rights platform called KODAKOne. Kodak hopes that the new virtual currency will help protect digital image rights for photographers, allowing them to securely register their work.  4. Internet of Things (IoT)  The IoT promises an ever-growing number of online devices to monitor and contribute to our connected lifestyle. But a significant barrier to the adoption of various smart gadgets is the walled ecosystems which some manufacturers insist upon, locking out devices from other vendors, and generally making things harder for the consumer looking to use a variety of different bits of hardware.  In 2015, IBM and Samsung showed off an application of the blockchain known as ADEPT (Autonomous Decentralized Peer-to-Peer Telemetry), which is designed to decentralize the IoT, and allow devices to communicate directly, without a manufacturer’s hub getting in the way and trying to lock users into a particular ecosystem.  5. Cloud storage  Storing data in the cloud has become an increasingly popular and convenient practice, although it still has potential problems – like downtime and losing access to your data temporarily, or more seriously, the cloud service being hacked.  Storj is a company that’s using the blockchain for open source cloud storage. Users are connected via blockchain and peer-to-peer technology, with a distributed network to store their data on. Folks with spare storage can also rent it out for income via the Storj app, as the storage space is crowd-sourced.  6. Public records  Our governments are entrusted to store a wide variety of information about individual citizens, including a lot of sensitive material such as financial data on tax returns or property records. Much of this information still exists only in paper form, or in siloed databases, and managing this data can be complicated, as it must be available, without error, and protected from hacking and manipulation.  The use of the blockchain represents an innovative solution to encode this data in a digital ledger, keeping the info safe from being altered. In the US, Delaware-based Ubitquity has the first blockchain-based system (currently in alpha) for property record management including titles, which is in testing overseas at the Land Records Bureau in Brazil.  7. Banking  Financial institutions continue to face challenges with identity theft, cost efficiency of transactions, and just general security. The blockchain will certainly digitally disrupt this industry, and holds the potential key to faster transactions, at less cost, and with a higher degree of security. IBM has partnered with Axoni and R3 to develop and deploy distributed ledger technology to the financial industry.  8. Car leasing  Leasing a car can end up being a protracted process, with multiple parties involved in the transaction, all needing to verify information before the car rolls off the lot. DocuSign, which specializes in secure digital documents, has partnered with credit card giant Visa to apply blockchain technology to Smart Contracts that promise a streamlined ‘click, sign and drive’ approach to securely leasing a vehicle. Now if only they could reduce the price of those floor mats...  9. Music rights  Soon after music went digital with MP3 files, music piracy was close behind, with artists losing control of their work, and record companies unhappy over the lost revenue stream.  The entertainment industry is looking to blockchain technology to secure digital rights for music and other media, with the potential to recapture that income. The British company JAAK has grabbed attention with its effort to create Smart Content with a “global view of content ownership and rights”.  10. Worker credentials  When companies hire an individual for a job, they want to get the best qualified person with the most appropriate experience levels. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to discern the truth behind the average resume or CV, as more than half of folks reportedly lie on their job applications – and indeed one study showed that a quarter of applicants said they’d worked for companies which in fact had never employed them.  This problem also arises at universities that need to verify the credentials of their faculty, and at hospitals that face a similar challenge when it comes to staff physicians and other healthcare professionals.  The Learning Machine is a company that hopes to change this. By applying blockchain technology, worker and professional credentials can be verified and kept in a secure digital ledger, which cannot be altered down the road to fit another position the applicant is subsequently interested in. The firm promises inherent fraud protection which could make choosing the right person for a job a good deal easier.

Fifty years ago next month, invitation-only audiences gathered in specially equipped Cinerama theaters in Washington, New York and Los Angeles to preview a widescreen epic that director Stanley Kubrick had been working on for four years. Conceived in collaboration with the science-fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke, “2001: A Space Odyssey” was way over budget, and Hollywood rumor held that MGM had essentially bet the studio on the project.  The film’s previews were an unmitigated disaster. Its story line encompassed an exceptional temporal sweep, starting with the initial contact between pre-human ape-men and an omnipotent alien civilization and then vaulting forward to later encounters between Homo sapiens and the elusive aliens, represented throughout by the film’s iconic metallic-black monolith. Although featuring visual effects of unprecedented realism and power, Kubrick’s panoramic journey into space and time made few concessions to viewer understanding. The film was essentially a nonverbal experience. Its first words came only a good half-hour in.  Audience walkouts numbered well over 200 at the New York premiere on April 3, 1968, and the next day’s reviews were almost uniformly negative. Writing in the Village Voice, Andrew Sarris called the movie “a thoroughly uninteresting failure and the most damning demonstration yet of Stanley Kubrick’s inability to tell a story coherently and with a consistent point of view.” And yet that afternoon, a long line—comprised predominantly of younger people—extended down Broadway, awaiting the first matinee.  Stung by the initial reactions and under great pressure from MGM, Kubrick soon cut almost 20 minutes from the film. Although “2001” remained willfully opaque and open to interpretation, the trims removed redundancies, and the film spoke more clearly. Critics began to come around. In her review for the Boston Globe, Marjorie Adams, who had seen the shortened version, called it “the world’s most extraordinary film. Nothing like it has ever been shown in Boston before, or for that matter, anywhere. The film is as exciting as the discovery of a new dimension in life.”  ‘Stanley and I are laughing all the way to the bank.’  Although incomprehensible by prevailing Hollywood standards, Kubrick’s cryptic, mostly dialogue-free structure fit well with the radical avant-garde artistic innovations of the period, and the movie was an immediate countercultural hit. John Lennon quipped, “‘2001’? I see it every week,” and David Bowie was inspired to record his hit single “Space Oddity” just under a year later—a clear allusion to the film. “2001” became a genuine late-’60s cultural happening and a bellwether of the decade’s generational divide. With ticket sales brisk from day one, the production ended up the highest-grossing film of 1968. “As for the dwindling minority who still don’t like it, that’s their problem, not ours,” Clarke wrote. “Stanley and I are laughing all the way to the bank.”  Fifty years later, “2001: A Space Odyssey” is widely recognized as ranking among the most influential movies ever made. The most respected poll of such things, conducted every decade by the British Film Institute’s Sight & Sound magazine, asks the world’s leading directors and critics to name the 100 greatest films of all time. The last BFI decadal survey, conducted in 2012, placed it at No. 2 among directors and No. 6 among critics. Not bad for a film that critic Pauline Kael had waited a contemptuous 10 months before dismissing as “trash masquerading as art” in the pages of Harper’s.  Although the film’s vision of humanity expanding throughout the solar system proved overoptimistic, its portrait of a screen-based, technology-mediated future now seems almost uncannily accurate, and it devastatingly evokes the dehumanization that can result from such communication. As for the cyclopean HAL-9000 supercomputer, often considered the most human character in “2001,” it foreshadowed our anxious contemporary discussion about the potentially dystopian impact of artificial-intelligence technologies.  The film’s extraordinary predictive realism was entirely premeditated, the result of Kubrick and Clarke’s questing, cerebral commitment to scientific and technical accuracy. By all accounts the production was run less like a big-budget Hollywood production than an extended futurological R&D exercise. A broad slate of top aerospace and computer companies were brought on board as consultants and advisers, with such leading innovators as IBM , Bell Labs and Hewlett-Packard all playing important roles.  In the summer of 1965, Kubrick received two detailed Bell Labs reports written by A. Michael Noll (a trailblazer in the development of digital arts and 3-D animation) and information theorist John R. Pierce (who coined the term “transistor” and headed the team that built the first communications satellite). They recommended that the spacecraft systems in “2001” all feature multiple “fairly large, flat and rectangular” screens, with “no indication of the massive depth of equipment behind them.” Flat screens were, of course, unknown in the ’60s—at least outside of movie theaters—and they helped to ensure 2001’s futuristic sheen.  The film featured forward-looking flat-screen tablet computers. Photo: Mary Evans/Everett Collection  The role of the film’s sentient supercomputer, originally named Athena, grew throughout the film’s development, under the influence of discussions that Kubrick and Clarke held with MIT cognitive scientist and artificial intelligence pioneer Marvin Minsky and British cryptologist and mathematician I. J. Good. The computer’s physical look resulted from advice provided by IBM’s influential design bureau-think-tank—the Apple Industrial Design Group of its day—then led by industrial designer Eliot Noyes.  In July 1965, Noyes and his team provided drawings of astronauts floating within a kind of “brain room”—a concept that Kubrick initially rejected but later recognized as having intriguing dramatic possibilities. The astronaut Dave Bowman’s methodical lobotomization of the computer after it—or rather, “he”—had killed off the rest of the crew, conducted within the dappled red confines of the film’s remarkable brain-room set, remains one of the most powerfully disturbing scenes ever committed to celluloid.  HAL stood for “Heuristic Algorithmic,” a Minsky suggestion. The computer’s homicidal tendencies emerged only gradually, forcing the production to remove its original IBM nameplate and to substitute another acronym—a kind of subliminal cognate, with “HAL” being displaced from “IBM” by only one letter in each case, something that both Kubrick and Clarke strenuously denied was intentional.  Another fascinating result of the production’s consultation with Big Blue was the film’s forward-looking flat-screen tablet computers, which retained their IBM logos and were called “Newspads.” Constructed long before such technologies were feasible, the movie’s seemingly portable Newspads were actually welded to the tables on which they appeared casually placed, with hidden 16mm film projectors recessed underneath to provide content for their frosted-glass displays.  In the film’s final cut, the Newspads were only used by the astronauts to watch a TV program ostensibly from the BBC and were thus largely indistinguishable from the various other displays embedded in the sets. But the production had received permission from the New York Times to use its logo, and Kubrick’s designers had mocked up a digital front page for the Newspads, complete with multiple story choices to be accessed by touch-screen command. If the page had been used, the movie would almost certainly now be seen as having predicted the internet.  More than four decades later, however, the predictive futurism of “2001” was decisively ratified when Apple released its first iPad in 2010. Samsung issued a similar device a year later, and Apple immediately sued for patent infringement. That August the Korean company filed a response in federal court in San Jose, Calif., asserting that Apple couldn’t possibly have invented the iPad because the device had already been envisioned in “2001: A Space Odyssey.”  Samsung’s unusual defense, which featured both stills and YouTube links from the film, was ultimately ruled inadmissible as evidence, but it confirmed what many fans have long appreciated: the continuing relevance and still-startling prescience of Kubrick’s masterpiece.  —Mr. Benson is the author of “Space Odyssey: Stanley Kubrick, Arthur Clarke and the Making of a Masterpiece,” which will be published on April 3 by Simon & Schuster.

NAIROBI, Kenya—Amid a push from Washington, Kenya’s president and his opposition rival on Friday promised to bury the hatchet on months of bitter standoff, an unexpected turn that came hours before Secretary of State Rex Tillerson landed in Nairobi.  The East African country, an important player on the continent in the U.S. war on terror, has been mired in political uncertainty after two fraught elections and bursts of violence.  In a news conference, President Uhuru Kenyatta and opposition leader Raila Odinga —who has refused to concede the vote—promised dialogue, and said they would soon roll out a specific path to reconciliation.  “We shall bring a process of bringing of our people together, and find out what really divides our nation,” Mr. Kenyatta said. “We must bring together all our people where no single person is left behind.”  Mr. Tillerson’s arrival, after stops in Ethiopia and Djibouti, reflects Kenya’s role as a top ally in combating al-Shabaab, the al Qaeda affiliate in Somalia. Nairobi is also home to regional headquarters to some major U.S. corporations like IBM , Google and Coca-Cola .  Mr. Tillerson congratulated the two men in a news conference in Nairobi later Friday, and he played down the U.S. role in the sudden reconciliation.  “The U.S. obviously has been very supportive of Kenya’s journey moving forward after what’s been a difficult election period,” he said. “This was very important action on their part to show that they are ready to work on behalf of all Kenyans … all the credit goes to the two leaders this morning.”  Ahead of the visit, a senior State Department official said the U.S. had extensively engaged with Mr. Odinga to bring about reconciliation.  “What we said to him ... is that you have a really tremendous opportunity for historic times to really push forward political and economic reforms,” said acting assistant Secretary of State for Africa Donald Yamamoto.  The U.S. diplomatic mission has been involved in attempting mediation as the political crisis deepened.  In the past few months, anti-U.S. sentiment has been on the rise. Opposition supporters saw U.S. recognition of Mr. Kenyatta as a partisan move, and protesters demonstrated outside the U.S. embassy earlier this year over what they called U.S. interference.  Unrest following the two elections led to dozens of fatalities and has reopened the ethnic rifts that in 2007 left more than 1,000 people dead in postelection violence.  Mr. Odinga, who represents a large swath of the population who feel cut off from the country’s elite, has accused Mr. Kenyatta of being a dictator and declared himself the “people’s president.”  On Friday he shook Mr. Kenyatta’s hand and promised to “end these differences.”  “We need to save our children from ourselves,” Mr. Odinga said.  The surprise moves comes amid an escalation of a standoff that started last year ahead of August presidential elections.  In a first for Africa, the outcome of those elections was annulled by the country’s Supreme Court, which ruled they had been marred by irregularities. Mr. Odinga boycotted new elections in October. Only one in three Kenyans took part, and Mr. Kenyatta was re-elected to another 5-year term with 98% of the vote.  Kenya’s economy, a pole for international investment where Chinese-built mega infrastructure like a $4-billion dollar railway runs alongside an equally ambitious highway being built by U.S. construction giant Bechtel, felt the pain of the prolonged crisis.  Its growth rate, previously among the continent’s highest at above 6%, and multiple times the world average, slowed down to 4.8% in 2017, according to the International Monetary Fund.  The Kenyan shilling inched higher against the dollar soon after the joint statement by the two leaders.  Write to Matina Stevis-Gridneff at matina.stevis@wsj.com

====================================
I always admired the way Steve Jobs could enrapture the world about a new product. His briefings of Apple breakthroughs over the years were legendary, and featured huge visuals behind him as he paced the stage. He was not just an innovator but also a master communicator. When I had to give addresses back in my military days, I would dive into Carmine Gallo’s “The Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs” for inspiration.  Watching Russian President Vladimir Putin roll out a similar display of fearsome new weapons at his state of the federation speech the other day had the distinct feeling of watching a Steve Jobs-style brief put together by "Q," the gadget-loving quartermaster from MI6, in a twisted James Bond movie. But this bag of tricks is neither a new iPhone nor an Aston Martin with machine guns, or even an exploding pen. Putin was talking about nuclear weapons moving toward the U.S. on a variety of new platforms. How seriously should we take this?  Let’s put aside that the video's special effects seemed straight from a 1990s video game, and start with the purported weapons themselves. In each case, U.S. intelligence has been tracking the development of these systems over the past decade. There is a nuclear-tipped and nuclear-powered torpedo; a new generation intercontinental ballistic missile with longer ranges; a nuclear-powered cruise missile that could theoretically fly more or less forever and attack the U.S. from any location; an air-launched high-speed cruise missile; and a hypersonic glide missile capable of flying 20 times the speed of sound. He also mentioned new laser systems to deploy against U.S. weapons. He described several of the weapons as “invincible.”  His motivation in hyping these systems is threefold. First, in the “all politics is local” category, he has an election coming up on March 18. While he is predictably and comfortably in the lead in all the polls (fairly easy to do when your opponents are assassinated or jailed and you have complete media control), he still wants to play to his base, as the saying goes. Russians, like people everywhere, enjoy nothing so much as a big spectacle on a huge stage. Add to that a good bashing of Russia’s enemy No. 1, and you have a sure winner.  Second, Putin is communicating with his circle of dictatorial allies and partners around the world. His message to Bashar al-Assad in Syria, Kim Jung Un in North Korea, and the ayatollahs in Iran (can you spell “axis of evil”?) is one of reassurance that someone can stand up to the U.S. in terms of global deterrence and high-end military technology. The demonstration is also a good way to enhance the sales of Russian weapons systems globally -- its producers are currently the second-largest supplier of weapons in the world and would love to surpass the U.S. Indeed, Russia exports as much as Germany, France and the U.K. combined, and triple what China sells globally.  Finally, Putin is sending a very direct signal to Washington. He hates U.S. and Western interference with Russia at any level, from the sanctions over the invasion of Ukraine and annexation of Crimea to the Olympic punishments meted out after the massive doping scandal. The intent here is simple and brutal: We are a nuclear power and can destroy your nation. The fact that the U.S. can do the same to Russia is not lost on Putin, but he will never miss a chance to remind the U.S. that Russia has an equally lethal nuclear arsenal.  In terms of serious military capability, last week's demonstration was a mixed bag. Nothing he displayed represented either a shock to the U.S. intelligence community or a significant change in the existing balance of nuclear and conventional power. Several of the systems have not been demonstrated publically, nor put into serious production. The most worrisome over time is probably the nuclear torpedo, but the idea of a Russian first-strike remains extremely remote. And it is hard to envision a scenario in which the U.S. decides to strike Russia. The odds are extremely high that we will continue along with the same deterrent regime that has kept the nuclear peace since the end of World War II: mutual assured destruction.  In terms of policy issues, Putin's display of braggadocio underscores several important points. First is that stepping up the U.S. conventional force posture in Europe is going to be critical to deterring Russia from using these kinds of weapons to threaten the Europeans. For a start, this means having a full four U.S. brigade combat teams in place and permanently stationed in Europe. We also must continue to push NATO allies to up their game in terms of forces that are combat-ready.  It also emphasizes the importance of avoiding an escalation on both sides, in terms of producing and deploying low-yield nuclear weapons, which could very quickly intensify in a tense scenario and cause Russia to use one of these strategic weapons -- what analysts refer to as the "escalate to de-escalate" doctrine. Finally, it will require the Pentagon to develop comparable systems to maintain deterrence, particularly hyper-sonic nuclear-tipped cruise missiles, where Russian progress is outstripping out own.  Another striking aspect of Putin's presentation was his hyper-vitriolic tone, even compared to his previous stridency on such occasions. Given that he will in all likelihood remain Russia's leader for life, we should pay significant attention to the uber-aggressive style of the display. It is hard to imagine any U.S. president in modern history, including even the current incumbent, depicting nuclear attacks on Russia on a large-screen display. It screams of a man desperate for respect, and such men can be very dangerous over time -- especially if they hold a relatively weak overall hand of cards.  And Putin does: Russia has profound demographic problems (also alluded to in Putin’s speech); serious environmental challenges; a struggling economy highly concentrated on hydrocarbons; and few real allies in the world. In many ways, we should worry more about Russian weakness than Russian strength.  For the U.S., the best move with Russia remains simple and transactional: confront where we must (Ukraine, Syria, cyber-intrusions); but cooperate where we can. The latter includes counter-narcotics, counter-piracy, counterterrorism, Afghanistan, the Arctic and other mutual concerns. And there are reasonable “Track 2” diplomatic options for the nations, such as exchanges between academic institutions, think tanks, laboratories and commercial entities.  We are not quite yet in a new Cold War, but it isn’t hard to see one shimmering in the near distance. Most worrisome of all, U.S. and Russian military forces are in combat in close proximity in Syria, and we are watching our military jets and warships maneuvering at close quarters in the Black and Baltic Seas. We are one significant tactical mistake away from stumbling into real danger. Leaders on both sides need to take a deep breath and encourage their subordinates to do the same. Big-screen videos of nuclear missiles and torpedoes attacking the U.S. don’t help.  This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.

Intel CEO Brian Krzanich Intel  Intel disclosed Friday it now faces 35 lawsuits related to the Spectre and Meltdown attacks.  Customers are charging they were harmed by the attacks; shareholders charge that Intel misled them about the state of its business, because it didn't disclose them sooner.  At least one shareholder suit is taking aim at alleged insider trading at Intel; questions have been raised about a massive stock sale by the company's CEO after Intel was informed of the attacks but before it disclosed them to the public.  The Spectre and Meltdown attacks were a public relations nightmare for Intel. Now they've become a legal headache as well.  The chip making giant, its board members, and executives face 35 lawsuits related to the attacks, the company disclosed in its annual report on Friday. Because the suits are in their early stages, Intel said it couldn't determine how much they could potentially cost it.  "We dispute the claims ... and intend to defend the lawsuits vigorously," the company said in its annual report.  A company representative declined to comment on the lawsuits.  Security researchers disclosed the Spectre and Meltdown attacks last month. Taking advantage of a particular feature found in nearly all computer processors, the attacks could allow a malicious actor to view secret data stored on PCs, tablets, and smartphones, including users' passwords. In recent weeks, chip makers, device manufacturers, and operating system vendors have been scrambling to patch their devices and software to protect them from the vulnerabilities.  The attacks were actually discovered in June, and Intel was made aware of them soon thereafter. The vulnerability the attacks exploit has been present in nearly all Intel chips made over the last 20 years. And, unlike chips made by other manufacturers, Intel's processors are vulnerable to both Spectre and Meltdown.  Intel's handling of Spectre and Meltdown has drawn criticism — and now lawsuits  Intel's handling of the situation has raised eyebrows not just because it waited more than six months to disclose the attacks to the public despite the fact that its chips were particularly at risk of them, but also because of a massive stock sale made by company CEO Brian Krzanich after the company found out about the attacks. In sale — through which Krzanich saw a $24 million windfall — the CEO sold off all of the shares of Intel he was allowed to sell under his contract.  Intel has noted that the sale, which Krzanich made in November, was done as part of a planned stock divestiture. But Krzanich only put that plan in place a month earlier, which was more than four months after Intel became aware of the attacks.  Thirty of the lawsuits filed against Intel are seeking class action status and were filed by customers who claim they were harmed by the attacks or by the company's failure to disclose them, according to the annual report. Two of the suits, also seeking class action status, were filed on behalf of shareholders who charge that the disclosure of the attacks shows that statements Intel made about its products or business were false or misleading.  Additionally, another three Intel investors have filed shareholder derivative suits in California state court, according to the annual report. Those suits charge that Intel's executives or directors failed in their duties to shareholders by delaying disclosure of the breach or not doing anything about insider trading at the company.  The Intel representative declined to say whether the company's board has investigated Krzanich's stock trade.

Reuters/Albert Gea  Two major flaws in how modern computers process information has sent the tech world scrambling for a fix.  Amid the scramble, Intel, the company most affected by the flaws, has seen its stock price slump.  But, as the company prepares to report earnings soon, one analyst thinks the company will be fine in the near term.  Watch Intel's stock price move in real time here.    Spectre and Meltdown, arguably the two biggest flaws ever found in modern computers, might not have a big impact on the near-term earnings of Intel, the company hit the hardest by the flaws.  At least, that's the thinking of John Pitzer, an analyst at Credit Suisse.  "While our calendar first quarter estimates embed NO negative impact to revenue from the Meltdown/Spectre security issues – near term we would highlight that the uncertainty created could cause at least some calendar first quarter server/client purchases to be deferred as IT managers look for more clarity," Pitzer said in a note to clients.  Spectre and Meltdown are flaws in a technique modern CPUs use to speed up computing. There are three total variations of the two flaws, and Intel is the only company whose chips have been reported to be affected by all three. The company has seen its share price decline about 8.73% so far this year after the flaws were disclosed publicly.  Pizter previously released a report the day after the flaws were disclosed that claimed everyone was making "mountains from molehills" regarding the flaws. A lot of new information about the flaws has surfaced since then, but Pizter is holding his ground, saying Intel's near-term revenue largely won't be affected.  There have been confusing and conflicting reports around the flaws since their public disclosure, however. AMD, which is Intel's main rival in the space, initially said its hardware would not be affected by the flaws, and later reversed its stance. Nvidia, which makes GPUs, created confusion when it issued Spectre and Meltdown patches for its products which were thought to be impervious to the flaws. Nvidia later clarified that its patches were only precautionary, and its products are not affected.  Patches to fix CPUs affected by the flaws were initially thought to slow down certain programs by as much as 30%, and an exact impact on performance has yet to be determined. Pitzer said IT managers and big data centers could delay planned purchases of Intel chips until more clarity is found, and the long-term effects of the flaws for chipmakers won't be evident for some time.  If certain companies' chips are found to be faster than others after all the final Spectre and Meltdown patches have been issued, there could be a sector-wide shift to the faster chips, Pitzer said.  Pizter has a "neutral" rating on Intel, but said it's mostly because he thinks the company is too expensive right now, not because of the potential risks associated with Spectre and Meltdown.  Intel reports fourth quarter earnings January 25, and Pitzer thinks the results will fall in line with Wall Street's expectations. Pizter is expecting earnings per share of $0.86 on revenue of $16.3 billion.  Markets Insider

In the United States, regulators have repeatedly thwarted attempts by Chinese tech groups to acquire American firms. And espionage concerns have for years kept Huawei — one of the world’s biggest suppliers of telecom gear, and a powerhouse of China’s tech scene — largely out of the American market.  Photo  The Trump administration says it wants to level the playing field, dishing out to Chinese companies the kind of treatment that American ones have been receiving in China for some time.  “China’s abilities and ambitions have shifted much further up the value-added chain, to tech that represents our crown jewels economically and that is relevant for national security,” said Scott Kennedy, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “So there’s no way to kick this can down the road anymore.”  Still, as much as American companies complain about how they are treated in China, it could get even worse if Beijing amplifies its retaliation beyond the tariffs, announced Friday, on $3 billion worth of goods.  China could require that foreign tech companies undergo costly additional tests for new products, or simply make it more difficult to operate in the country. Apple, whose iPhones remain coveted among well-off Chinese, made nearly $18 billion in the country in the last quarter of 2017. Qualcomm, the San Diego microchip maker, has earned half its revenue in China in recent years.  It could also devise new regulatory hoops for foreign companies to jump through. China’s Ministry of Commerce has not yet approved Qualcomm’s proposed, $44 billion purchase of NXP Semiconductors, a Dutch chip maker. The deal, more than a year in the making, needs a signoff from Chinese antitrust authorities because the two companies count a large number of electronics makers in China as customers.  Both countries’ efforts to kneecap each other’s tech champions are as much about national security as economic might. Likewise with the race to dominate frontier fields such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing and next-generation wireless internet. Mr. Trump recently blocked a hostile bid by Broadcom to buy Qualcomm. He did so not because the bidder was Chinese — Broadcom is headquartered in Singapore — but because the administration said the deal would weaken Qualcomm, leaving Huawei with a stronger hand to shape 5G, or fifth-generation mobile technology.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  This is why the present tensions are so difficult to resolve. In a previous era, Japan was a technological rival but a military ally. The Soviet Union was a tech rival in defense, though a laggard in the commercial sphere.  Photo  “The U.S. and China have so intertwined their science and technology systems through trade and investment and cooperative research — but see each other, and continue to see each other, as strategic competitors and adversaries,” said Adam Segal, a tech and security expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. “That hasn’t happened before.”  China’s angst about foreign tech dominance runs deep.  For most of the past decade, Beijing has blocked many American internet services, including Facebook’s and Google’s, to control the flow of information and head off social media-fueled movements such as the Arab Spring.  Another great paroxysm of worry came in 2013, when Edward J. Snowden leaked documents showing ties between American technology providers and the National Security Agency’s vast surveillance program.  For China, “one of the major takeaways was, ‘We are overly reliant on American technology over which we have very little control,’” said Rogier Creemers, a scholar of Chinese tech policy at Leiden University in the Netherlands.  A Communist Party-linked newsmagazine singled out the American companies that it said had penetrated most deeply into China’s information infrastructure. The “Eight Guardian Warriors,” as they were called — Apple, Cisco, Google, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Oracle and Qualcomm — had been able to “drive right into China,” the article said, whereas Huawei and another Chinese equipment maker, ZTE, had been kept out of the United States.  Beijing swung into action. It banned government offices from installing the most recent version of Microsoft Windows, and antitrust investigators raided Microsoft’s offices. Cisco, Apple and Intel products were removed from state lists that officials use as guides when buying equipment. Qualcomm got slapped with a $975 million fine for anticompetitive behavior.  The political pressure sent American companies scrambling to link up with Chinese partners, leading to joint ventures of the sort that the Trump administration, and some in the American business community, have decried as unfair.

Microsoft, in conjunction with a state company closely tied to the Chinese military, developed a version of Windows more suitable for China’s government. Advanced Micro Devices, Intel and Qualcomm began working with Chinese organizations in microchips, which China imports in huge quantities to put into smartphones, computers and other electronics.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Despite the boost from America’s giants, and hefty doses of state funding, China’s semiconductor push is still in its early days. But most observers believe that it is only a matter of time before Chinese factories catch up to those at industry leaders in the United States, South Korea and Taiwan.  “They are very conscious that they still have a long way to go,” said Dieter Ernst, a senior fellow at the East-West Center, a research and educational organization based in Honolulu. “But they also know that in semiconductors, they are by far the most important market for American companies.”  One stumbling block for China: Attempts to scoop up foreign chip makers mostly have not worked out. State-owned Tsinghua Unigroup tried to buy Micron Technology, a memory chip maker based in Idaho, for $23 billion in 2015, but regulatory worries scuttled the deal.  The Trump administration last year blocked a China-backed investor from buying Lattice Semiconductor, an Oregon-based manufacturer. And regulatory concerns scotched a Chinese investment group’s plan to buy Xcerra, even though the Massachusetts-based company makes chip-testing equipment and not chips themselves.  In Washington, concern about the emerging rivalry with China has been reflected in a number of recent reports, from the likes of the Pentagon and the Department of Energy, that warn about the country’s growing tech capabilities. Still, shorter-term considerations could mean that Washington would back down before Beijing in an all-out trade war.  “If the markets take a nose-dive as we move closer to the midterm elections,” Mr. Kennedy of the Center for Strategic and International Studies said, “that would put some pressure on Trump to look for face-saving solutions, even if final problems haven’t been addressed.”

====================================
When we first heard of Intel’s H-series Coffee Lake processors for laptops, we had a hunch it would include some of company’s first hexa-core CPUs. But, we never expected Core i9 to make the jump to laptops .  On desktops, high-end processors, like the Intel Core i9-7980XE , have brought the highest-core counts we’ve seen on consumer chips and the greatest multi-core performance we’ve tested.  In similar fashion, the top-of-the-line chip boasts a six-core and 12-thread arrangement for the first time on a mobile part, with the addition of higher clock speeds up to 4.8GHz, thanks to its fully unlocked status. Intel claims that its Core i9-8950HK is the best gaming and content-creation laptop processor it has ever built. Even amongst its 8th generation H-series brethren, this top-end part is claimed to deliver at least 10% more performance than the second-most powerful Intel Core i7-8850H.  Of course, there’s always a greater story behind any legendary leap forward such as this, and Fredrik Hamberger, general manager of premium and gaming notebooks at Intel, is excited to tell all.  “We saw the demand from our highest-end enthusiasts for more performance,” Hamberger says, explaining the origins of the first mobile Core i9 processor. “They wanted something more, different and higher-end than just what we were scaling with our entire category.”  “So, we looked at that and we had an opportunity to squeeze a little more out of our process and by doing some unique things, like Thermal Velocity Boost.”  Thermal Velocity Boost will require the best cooled notebooks  Going into overdrive  Just what is Thermal Velocity Boost (TVB) anyway? It’s basically a feature that allows Intel’s top-end processor to achieve an additional 200MHz of additional frequency on top its standard 4.6GHz Turbo Boost.  “By taking advantage of the fact that, at lower temperatures, you can actually achieve higher frequencies,” Hamberger explains, “we’ve done some tweaking to our process and microcode to enable an additional boost in frequency when the processor temperature allows. “  Like most of Intel’s Turbo Boost technology, Thermal Velocity Boost turns on automatically applies the 200 extra megahertz of additional frequency as long as a workload – such as a video encode or rendering 3D models – requires it and the chip is operating at 50-degrees Celsius or lower.  As Hamberger explains it, TVB is centered around burst workloads rather holding a sustained overclock for tasks such as gaming.  “As the part heats up, you might drop down to only 100MHz of additional frequency and when it reaches something above 70- or 80-degrees Celsius you might not get that any additional speed,” Hamberger says.  Still, you can expect the chip to operate at its guaranteed turbo boost frequency of 4.6GHz up to 100-degrees Celsius. Any hotter than that, and you’ll most likely have other problems on your hands.  Bringing desktop power to laptops  Following our talks with Intel, it is abundantly clear that the ultimate goal of its new Intel Core i9 chip is to bring the power of desktops to the laptop. The concept isn’t exactly new to the mobile space: over the years, we’ve seen plenty of manufacturers implement desktop processors into gaming laptops , such as the Origin EON15-X .  Intel, being the actual maker of the processors, wasn’t about to just ramshackle a desktop-level part into a notebook. Rather, it engineered a chip completely designed for mobile with a thermal design and power delivery that notebooks could support.  “We saw the wish for power and performance and that’s what we’re trying to deliver, giving them as much as we can in a mobile-friendly form factor,” Hamberger tells us. “You get that better form factor, battery life and tuning that you wouldn’t get with a socketed part in a notebook chassis.”  “If you look at what we did with our highest-end performing SKU. The Core i9 is on par with last year’s desktop chip.  The thinnest Intel Core i9-powered laptop  For the most part, Hamberger sees musclebook – a new phrase Intel has coined for thicker workstations and gaming notebooks – users being able to take the full advantage of Core i9’s overclocking capabilities as they offer a higher level of cooling, allowing for TVB to kick in more often. That said, there will also be thinner laptops capable of supporting Intel’s highest-end chip, such as the Dell XPS 15 .  “It’s also going to show up in the sub 20mm category that has thinness and greater battery life than six hours,” he says.  If you look at the history of silicon in computers, there’s always been a trickle-down effect, especially in Intel’s case. Intel Core i9, and the greater Core X series, brought server capability into a desktop format with megatasking.  Now, Intel Core i9 brings the performance of a desktop and server-borne megatasking to notebooks, all within the company’s first hexa-core processors for laptops. Here’s to hoping the trend continues and we see mobile CPUs with eight or more cores in the near future.

Intel is making life a little easier for PC gamers on a budget. A new driver update for its 6th-gen Core processors and above will configure a game to your rig's specs automatically. As PC World reports, this includes the "Kaby Lake G" processors on addition to Skylake. Finally, no more fiddling in the menus on your machine running integrated graphics to get a game to run above 20FPS. At least that's the idea. It's a lot like how NVIDIA's GeForce Experience works for discrete graphics cards. The first games to benefit from this include Battlefield 1, Dota 2, Grand Theft Auto V, League of Legends and Overwatch. Sure, you'll probably lose out on shadow detail and texture filtering, but at least you'll be able to play, period.

Shenoy also discussed how the Spectre and Meltdown fixes will affect servers, staying true to Intel's promise to be more transparent. He revealed the initial data the company got from benchmarking server platforms using two-socket Intel Xeon Scalable -- its latest microarchitecture -- systems. It found that the fixes don't affect servers' energy efficiency and it didn't detect a slowdown when running Java business applications. However, it detected minimal impact of around 2 to 4 percent in some cases and saw significant slowdowns when it ran tests simulating different types of input/output (I/O) loads.  When it stressed the CPU to use 100 percent of its power to read data, it didn't see a decrease in speed. But when it tasked the system to use 100 percent of its power to write data, its speed decreased by a whopping 18 percent. In addition, when the company tested the system using tools for writing high performance, scalable, user-mode storage applications, it saw a 25 percent decrease in speed when only using a single core.  Intel says it's working with partners and customers to address the areas where it saw significant slowdowns. One of the options it's looking at is Retpoline, the technique a Google engineer conjured up to protect the tech titan's systems from the second variant of Spectre without affecting performance.

(Reuters) - Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) is offering more than $300 million to buy a company that owns billboards across Los Angeles, including on West Hollywood’s famed Sunset Strip, a move that could help it save money maintaining a high profile in the world’s entertainment capital, according to people familiar with the matter.  The purchase of Regency Outdoor Advertising, if successful, would be the largest yet for the fast-growing Silicon Valley streaming video company, which has a studio in Hollywood and is now one of the world’s biggest film and TV producers.  Netflix’s motivation was not immediately clear, but it could save money over time with the deal, according to industry analysts, as it ramps up spending on marketing for its original shows and movies to $2 billion this year. Netflix used Regency Outdoor billboards to promote its “Stranger Things” and “The Crown” drama series.  A billboard ad on Los Angeles’s Sunset Strip can cost $140,000 per month, said Barry Lowenthal, president of The Media Kitchen, a New York-based media buyer.  “This is a smart move for Netflix because it is a very important viewing market,” Lowenthal said. “Los Angeles matters to the people in the industry.”  Tech firms Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Hulu and Facebook Inc (FB.O) and traditional media companies such as Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) are all vying with Netflix to win subscribers.  Netflix is just one of the bidders for Los Angeles-based Regency Outdoor and there is no certainty that its offer will prevail, the sources said this week, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential.  Netflix declined to comment. Its shares were close to unchanged in a slightly lower market. Regency Outdoor did not respond to a request for comment.  The Netflix logo is pictured on a television in this illustration photograph taken in Encinitas, California, U.S., January 18, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake  ANALOG ADS, DIGITAL CONTENT  The world’s leading streaming media company still uses physical advertising space such as billboards to promote its shows. Billboards are holding their own compared to other forms of traditional advertising such as ads in newspapers or TV that are easy to skip.  Regency Outdoor, owned by brothers Drake and Brian Kennedy, owns billboards on Sunset Strip, a portion of Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles known for its live music and night clubs and filled with splashy billboards promoting upcoming TV shows and movies.  It also has billboards at Los Angeles International Airport, on major freeways, near the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) campus, and close to the Los Angeles Angels baseball stadium, according to the company’s website.  Netflix said in a letter to shareholders earlier this year that its marketing spending was growing “a little faster” than its revenue.  As a result of the bigger marketing expenditure, Netflix’s expenses per subscriber will jump around 25 percent to $16 per subscriber, up from $13 per subscriber, according to a recent MoffettNathanson report. The company reported it had 117.6 million worldwide streaming subscribers at the end of 2017, more than any direct competitor.  “As the marketplace for original content becomes more crowded, Netflix is turning up the volume to promote the increasing number of Netflix originals,” Michael Nathanson, a MoffettNathanson analyst, wrote in the research note.  Netflix’s first known acquisition was last year’s purchase of comic book publisher Millarworld for an undisclosed sum.

At last an end to geoblocking in Europe? Nope, not by a long chalk…  The European Commission is holding a press conference later today to trumpet progress made on ending “unjustified geoblocking”, as it tells it, with the stated aim of greasing the wheels of pan-EU ecommerce in time for Christmas.  Which, from a consumer point of view, sounds great. Unfortunately it’s not quite as great as it sounds. Especially if you were imagining it would apply to popular digital media streaming services like Spotify and Netflix . Nope, sorry.  Geoblocks for digital media are not being vanquished in this round of EU Digital Single Market regulation chess.  What is being agreed by EU lawmakers is an end to geoblocks for the sale of goods and services — just not if the electronic services in question happen to be stuff like, er, streaming music, TV, video and so on…  Don’t be fooled if a speaker says that we abolished #geoblocking, though. We didn’t. Only for buying goods & services, but not for digital media like videos, games, ebooks. Progress is slow. https://t.co/T9LnFEul1y — Julia Reda (@Senficon) February 5, 2018  A crumb of comfort on that front is last year agreement was reached among EU institutions on new rules around the portability of digital content for travelers — meaning that from this year EU citizens traveling across the 28 Member State bloc can now access the online media services which they have already subscribed to when they are on holiday in another EU country.  But if you want to actually subscribe to — and continuously consume — those sorts of audio-visual digital services across EU borders, well, you’re going to be out of luck. Copyright being the major blocker here.  What does this mean in practice? Well, EU geoblocks are certainly alive and well if you try to sign up to — for example — Netflix from a different Member State to the EU country where you live (or where your bank cards were issued).  Or even if you attempt to buy a Spotify gift card for a person who lives in a different EU country to the country you do.  The digital service providers will simply deny these kind of transactions — and the notion of an EU ‘digital single market’ will be shown up as rather more aspiration than actual at this point. Nor is that situation going to change this year.  The Commission does know this — because it’s at least making an attempt to address the regulatory dissonance. In September 2016 it proposed additional EU legislation aimed at facilitating the provision of cross-border audiovisual services.  But an EC spokeswoman confirmed to us that those provisions remain under negotiation.  And, as MEP Julia Reda tweeted yesterday, progress is slow. The progress-blocking culprit? Take a bow Hollywood et al…  That’s why we will still vote in favour. It’s important to note though that also the Parliament position would have left copyright and licensing regimes completely intact. It’s just excluded because nobody wants to fight the powerful entertainment industry. — Julia Reda (@Senficon) February 5, 2018  In a 2016 impact assessment document attached to the Commission’s proposal — and specifically discussing the licensing of video on demand rights — the EC wrote that its preferred option “includes a European stakeholders’ dialogue and a negotiation mechanism that would facilitate the conclusion of licences for the online exploitation of audiovisual works by removing contractual blockages”.  Which is a long-winded way of saying they need to get the entertainment industry to agree to cross-border licensing. So, frankly speaking, I wouldn’t hold your breath for the arrival of that truly seamless digital single market dream.  The EC’s VP for the # DigitalSingleMarket recognized the problem in comments made at a plenary meeting yesterday — saying it intends to pay “particular attention” to the “non-audio visual copyright protected services like software, games, e-books and music”, and admitting the current regulation only partially covers this sort of digital content.  His comments also confirm that services like Netflix represent the hardest digital content cross-border portability problem to fix. (Even — and here’s the consumer kicker — as they’re likely to be the kind of services EU citizens really do want ‘seamless’ access to… )  What about #geoblocking of content protected by #copyright?  ➡️We'll review the scope of #geoblocking rules 2 years after entry into force  ➡️I urge MEPs & Member States to agree on #satcab rules on cross-border access to audiovisual content online & keep level of ambition pic.twitter.com/AwMSi6cPxY — Andrus Ansip (@Ansip_EU) February 6, 2018  So, for the circa 20 million EU citizens the EC says were born in a different EU Member State from the one where they live now, there will be around three years’ wait before the Commission is even going to take a closer look at the kind of geoblocks they’re still being saddled with.  And the Christmas 2018 consolation prize of a partial end to geoblocks is just that: A piecemeal offer that doesn’t change much.  Instead of seamless cross-border access to popular streaming media services this year, EU citizens might be able to shop online for physical goods from another EU Member State which they then have to go and pick up themselves (or arrange their own shipping).  They may also be able to purchase an electronic service like web hosting from another Member State without having to pay any additional fees (though not necessarily obtaining the service at the same price).  And they could perhaps be able to purchase a service provided in a specific physical location without being redirected to a local website to do so.  All thanks to the Commission’s ‘unjustified geoblocks’ regulation. (‘Might’, ‘may’ and ‘could’ because the EC notes the regulation does not impose an obligation on companies to sell. Nor does it harmonise prices, as noted above.)  The point of this piecemeal regulation, says the EC, is to address discrimination in access to goods and services “in cases where it cannot be objectively justified (e.g. by VAT obligations or different legal requirements)”.  It’s just a shame it’s the Commission has failed to embrace a meaningful reform of digital copyright rules across the bloc. And you’ll therefore have to forgive some of us EU consumers for not finding a whole lot to celebrate here.

Think of Netflix as the Upside Down in its sci-fi series “Stranger Things.” By this I don’t mean that it’s a nefarious or dangerous force. But it is a kind of alternative TV dimension, overlaying and replicating the known world of traditional television, that tries to acquire one of everything that exists in the universe of TV.  Initially, the company did this through literal acquisition: buying streaming rights to hit TV series. Then it did it through imitation: reviving Fox’s “Arrested Development” and creating originals, like “House of Cards,” in the mold of premium cable. Now it’s imitating through acquisition, spiriting away the likes of Mr. Murphy and Ms. Rhimes to its well-remunerated plane.  The history of TV is one of upstarts and competitors, and my first instinct was to liken Netflix to something like cable, which rose as a serious competitor to broadcast TV in the 1980s.  But there’s an important difference between cable channels and Netflix (besides whom you write your check to). Cable channels have brands. That was what made them different from broadcast networks, which tried to be, and had to be, everything. Cable channels had specialties and sensibilities: CNN was news; ESPN was sports; HBO was adult sophistication (give or take an “Entourage”).  Photo  A cable brand might evolve — Bravo went from an arts channel to the “Real Housewives” channel — but the idea was to offer a specific aesthetic to a specific audience.  Netflix doesn’t have that; in fact, it is specifically anti-that. Its brand is “stuff that you like to watch on TV.” It developed a vast library of reruns, and with that, a proprietary trove of data on who likes to watch what and how much. Then it made more of that, or bought it. If you liked “30 Rock,” here’s “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.” If you liked “Damages,” here’s “Bloodline.”  Look at just the past few months of Netflix programming. There’s “The Crown,” a BBC-style historical drama. “Wormwood,” an Errol Morris docudrama. “One Day at a Time,” a 21st-century reboot of a 1970s network TV multicamera sitcom. “Dirty Money,” a “Frontline”-esque documentary anthology. “She’s Gotta Have It,” a risqué romantic comedy. “My Next Guest Needs No Introduction,” a David Letterman interview series. Oh, and why not — let’s throw in a “Cloverfield” sequel and a Will Smith movie.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Something for everyone — that was the ethos of broadcast TV in the old three-network era. The obvious analogy, then, is that Netflix isn’t cable at all; it’s a broadcaster, pitching a big tent.  But, as I’ve written before, there’s one very important difference. Broadcasters, whose advertising model required millions of eyeballs on every individual show, had to make sure that everything they aired appealed to a broad range of people.  That business imperative had aesthetic results: It gave us family sitcoms and comfort-food cop dramas. It’s less true today, in the era of smaller audiences — but it’s still much more true of NBC than, say, of IFC.

View all New York Times newsletters.  Netflix, on the other hand, is breathtakingly broad and microscopically niche at the same time. It’s selling a platform to everyone, but by providing products for very specific tastes.  Netflix assumes a future in which we’re watching our faves on our own screens, rather than gathering around an electronic fireplace — and as long as the monthly payment clears, it’s all the same to the company. It’s less a big tent than a Dothraki tent city, to borrow a metaphor from “Game of Thrones.”  What does this mean for Ryan Murphy and Shonda Rhimes? Maybe not much at all. They were both powerful producers with a lot of freedom who will now have a lot of freedom and more money.  Photo  Mr. Murphy was, in a way, the Netflix-iest of producers to begin with: He’d made everything from a broadcast network sitcom (“The New Normal”) to an action show (“9-1-1”) to a marquee cable drama (“Feud”) to an HBO film (“The Normal Heart”). He may be able to branch out even more, but he was hardly fettered.  What Ms. Rhimes does at Netflix will be interesting. She’s the consummate network TV producer, having essentially defined the current voice of ABC with “Grey’s Anatomy” and “Scandal.”  She might do something very different with the license of streaming — but if she doesn’t, that will fit in all the same at Netflix, which resurrected the broadcast favorite “Gilmore Girls” with much the same tone, give or take a few curse words. One curious thing about Netflix is that every sensibility — niche and mass, G-rated and NSFW — exists on the same platform and the same plane.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Is all the deal-making worth it? Whether Netflix is emptying its deep pockets wisely by making itself into a Hall of Fame for established stars (see also Dave Chappelle) isn’t my concern as a TV critic.  What I do care about is whether Netflix can nurture original, distinctive art, especially if it continues growing into a huge, all-encompassing alterna-TV.  And I worry whether it can do that when derivation is the business strategy itself: selling people new versions of things they already like. It’s fine that Netflix can toss around enough money to reactivate David Letterman. But does it have the kind of culture that could discover a new David Letterman?  In its short life as an original programmer. Netflix has made a few series I’d consider legitimately great. But most of them have involved making deals with creators with limited track records (“BoJack Horseman,” “American Vandal”) or talented artists relatively new to creating series (“Master of None,” “Lady Dynamite”). (As I’ve also written before, these shows tend to be comedies, which may translate more directly and easily to the streaming format.)  A more familiar experience on Netflix is the good-enough version of a drama you’ve seen elsewhere. “Godless,” say, was a perfectly decent dark western, but no “Deadwood.” “Stranger Things” is a joy, but it’s a pastiche by design: It’s the Netflix ethos in story form, reproducing and remixing memories in ways that tickle just the right nostalgia pleasure centers.  It may be that Netflix’s approach means more competence and fewer out-and-out stinkers. And I have no reason to believe that Mr. Murphy and Ms. Rhimes will become any less creative because Netflix backed up a money truck.  But if Netflix is truly becoming a parallel TV universe, I hope its algorithm finds room for the experimental and untried. It’s hard to be groundbreaking when your whole purpose is to take people where they’ve already been.

Hastings addressed this and a wide range of other topics during a 30-minute chat with members of the media. One of the most notable things the Netflix chief mentioned is that his streaming service doesn't have any plans whatsoever to do live TV, even if rivals like Hulu and Amazon's Prime Video are investing heavily in that space. "To follow a competitor, never, never, never," he said. "We have so much we want to do in our area, so we're not trying to copy others, whether that's linear cable, there's lots of things we don't do. We don't do [live] news, we don't do [live] sports. But what we do do, we try to do really well."  He said that while "all of these media companies" are trying to get into video, specifically newcomers such as Facebook, Netflix has been competing with seasons rivals like Amazon for a decade and he's happy with the success of his company thus far. Earlier this year, during its Q4 2017 earnings report, Netflix announced that it added 8.3 million new customers that quarter, its largest single-quarter growth ever. Those numbers certainly seem to bolster Hasting's confidence. He said that, while it's a very competitive market at the moment -- and it's only going to get tougher with others like Facebook and YouTube joining the fray -- he believes that if Netflix continues to produce great series and content, it has nothing to worry about.  "If we do our own Prime service, we'll never succeed," he said, referring to the idea that Netflix could offer something beyond its on-demand content. He added that what hurts Netflix's competitors is that "their strategy is to win by being broad, you know, a little bit of everything." Hastings said it's also key to ensure customers that they're never going to see ads on a Netflix product, despite the potential for lower prices and creating more revenue. Hastings didn't have to mention Hulu or YouTube by name to know those are the platforms he was referring to. "Really having great experience -- no advertisements or chopping up all of the content -- vastly outweigh the fact that one company is gaining a lot of influence."

The only thing better than the Ultra HD graphics and silky-smooth gameplay that PC gaming affords is all the cool gear surrounding your computer. From keyboards to mice, monitors, gaming chairs and headsets, PC gaming hardware goes much farther than your main rig.  While we’re all still lusting after that ultra-wide gaming monitor or fancy keyboard, there are always new products to pine after. This year at CES 2018 , we got our first glimpse of some of the most desirable pieces of gaming gear we’ve seen yet.  Asus Bezel-Free Kit  Multi-monitor setups for PC gaming can be amazing, especially for flight simulators and racing games but the only thing that sucks is seeing gaps between each of your screens. Asus’ Bezel-Free monitor kit aims to eliminate the problem by optically merging two or more screens into a seamless picture.  Because it only uses prisms and the magic of light refraction, they can be slipped between practically any monitors with thin bezels and require no electronic control or power to work. If you’re already using a dual or triple monitor setup, this is the easiest way to DIY an ultra-wide screen rather than outright buying a whole new display.  Expected: Late 2018  HP Omen X 65 BFGD  Nvidia Big Format Gaming Displays made a huge splash at CES 2018, and we came away most impressed by the HP version: the Omen X 65 BFGD . Just looking at specifications that include a 65-inch panel, 4K resolution, HDR compliancy, a 120Hz refresh rate and 1 millisecond response rate, it’s hard not to be wowed. This truly is the ultimate display for PC gaming.  Expected: Fall 2018  Nvidia GeForce Now for PC beta  While this might not be a physical bit of kit, Nvidia GeForce Now coming to PC is something everyone will love. This gaming streaming service turns every Windows laptop, desktop and tablet into a gaming PC – whether it be a lowly netbook or a top of the line Ultrabook, almost anyone can access Nvidia’s extensive online PC game library.  Expected: Available now  Corsair Dark Core RGB SE & MM1000 Qi  We’ve seen a plenty of wireless mice and even a few wireless charging mice, but the Dark Core RGB SE is the first Qi-charging gaming mouse in the world. When paired with Corsair’s new MM1000 Qi wireless charging mouse pad, you can practically run the Dark Core RGB SE forever. As a bonus, the whole wireless charging setup is fully compatible with Qi-charging phones, including the latest iPhone X and Samsung Galaxy Note 8 .  Expected: Available now  Cooler Master MasterKeys MK851  The Cooler Master MasterKeys MK851 might just look like another RGB backlit mechanical keyboard, but it comes with the unique feature of analog keys. Modern keyboards are fully digital inputs, but on its latest product, Cooler Master has included eight analog keys around and including the WASD keys.  These analog switches allow you to lightly press keys to move characters around more slowly. Alternatively, they could act like physical pedals for racing games and many more precise controls we’ve yet to even imagine.  Expected: Mid 2018  Zotac AMP Box  We’ve seen prototypes of Zotac external GPU box for well over a year now, so it was exciting to finally see it in its final form at CES 2018. Unlike the Razer Core and Asus ROG Station 2, the Zotac AMP Box is quite a bit smaller and designed for only mini GPUs. That said, this is one of the finest GPU boxes built completely out of aluminum while also featuring a fully customizable RGB lighting setup.  Expected: Early 2018  Razer Nommo Pro  Computer speakers are often overlooked for a PC gaming setup, but Razer’s new Razer Nommo Pro delivers an incredible audio bang that headphones could never muster. The 2.1 THX certified speaker system features a Dupont Kevlar coated driver that projects solid mids, while silk-woven tweeters produce smooth and balanced highs.  Meanwhile, a cylindrical downward-firing subwoofer is designed to generate airflow for consistent, deep tones. Put all together, it’s one of the fullest-sounding and loudest PC gaming speaker systems we’ve ever heard.  Expected: Early 2018  Vertagear PL4500 RGB Gaming Chair  We never thought it would be possible, but Vertagear has integrated RGB lighting into a gaming chair. The PL4500 RGB comes with lighting built into the harness through-holes and underneath its base for an underglow effect. The whole thing is powered by batteries – that Vertagear claims can power its RGB gaming chair for 30 hours – and it can even wirelessly sync effects and colors to your PC through NZXT CAM. It’s the perfect piece of furniture to complement your RGB lit PC, keyboard, mouse, mousepad and room lighting.  Expected: Spring 2018  SteelSeries Rival 600  The SteelSeries Rival 600 is one of the first dual-sensor gaming mice we’ve seen. Going with two sensors not only makes it more accurate, it also reduces sensor drifting when you lift off with your mouse. This gaming mouse also comes with eight 4g weights, allowing users to increase its weight from 96g all the way to 128g.  Expected: Available now  MSI Optix MPG27CQ  We’ve seen RGB lighting come to gaming monitors before, but the MSI Optix MPG27CQ might be the first display to actually put it to good use. Rather than putting the lights behind the screen or give monitors an underglow effect, they’re right below the panel. This way users can set lights to signal ability cooldowns and other in-game timers or Discord chat notifications. We’ve seen the same sort of utility come to keyboards, but it makes much more sense to get this information on a monitor you’re already staring at.  Expected: Late 2018

Whether it's snug in your PC cabinet or soldered on your laptop, the graphics card is the key component for PC gaming. Anyone even remotely interested in gaming would tell you that integrated graphics solutions don't really work, if you want to play the top and newest games.  A graphics card doesn’t even need to take up a ton of space. With Nvidia’s cutting-edge Max-Q tech for instance, you can run games in 4K in considerably thin laptops. But it comes at a pretty hefty price tag. Take the Asus ROG Zephyrus for an example.  AMD's renewed interest in high-end components showcased by the Radeon RX Vega has started a whole new battle in the best graphic cards market. So, here's some help to make your choice easier.  Best high-end GPU: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 Ti  Titan X performance without the Titan X cost  Stream Processors: 3,584 | Core Clock: 1,480MHz | Memory: 11GB GDDR5X | Memory Clock: 11GHz | Power Connectors: 1 x 6-pin; 1 x 8-pin | Outputs: 3 x DisplayPort, 1 x HDMI  Titan X-like gaming performance  Improved cooling  A pricey investment for most  The GTX 1080 Ti is exactly what the Titan X Pascal should have been. Thanks to 11GB of GDDR5X VRAM, the GTX 1080 Ti is more capable than the GTX 1080, without costing an arm and a leg.  Performance-wise, the GTX 1080 Ti can’t compete with dual-wielding 1080s, but it is cheaper and it supports a larger pool of games than two lesser SLI cards. Aside from the mysterious absence of a DVI port, the GTX 1080 Ti looks identical to any of the other Pascal-series GPUs. However, take a closer inside and you’ll notice a sophisticated cooling system needed to keep all of your games running smoothly in up to 4K resolutions.  Read the full review: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 Ti  Best mid-range GPU: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060  The best GPU to start PC gaming  Stream Processors: 1,280 | Core Clock: 1,506MHz | Memory: 6GB GDDR5 | Memory Clock: 8Gbps | Power Connectors: 1 x 6-pin | Outputs: 3 x DisplayPort 1.4, 1 x HDMI 2.0, DL-DVI  Solid 1080p performance  Great overclocker  No SLI compatibility  For Indian buyers though, value for money is often more important than raw power. And we think the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 is unparalleled when it comes to sheer value.  For a reasonable price, this graphics card offers 1080p gaming and – perhaps with a bit of overclocking – even 1440p. At the same time, however, the GTX 1060 doesn’t have SLI support, so you’re limited to a single card at a time.  Read the full review: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060  Best entry-level GPU: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 Ti  Competitive for both eSports and in price  Stream Processors: 768 | Core Clock: 1,290MHz | Memory: 4GB GDDR5 | Memory Clock: 7Gbps | Power Connectors: PCIe | Outputs: 1 x DisplayPort 1.4, 1 x HDMI 2.0, DL-DVI  Solid 1080p performer  Good overclocking potential  Greater than 75W TDP  The Nvidia GTX 1050 Ti is another an affordable option. It supports a lot of games at 60fps, however, it is a tad more expensive than the GTX 1050.

The 15-inch model is particularly interesting as a graphics and gaming unit, since it comes with a nicely powerful NVIDIA GTX 1060 graphics card (the 13-incher has NVIDIA GTX 1050 graphics). Though you might be tempted to buy it as a gaming machine, know that the power supply isn't enough to sustain a charge if you're running games like Destiny 2, however. Microsoft has yet to say how or whether it will rectify that rather weird issue.  The original Surface Book suffered from power management and other bugs, but Microsoft told Engadget last year that it learned from that experience for the Surface Book 2. In fact, Microsoft fixed nearly everything we didn't like about the last one, strengthening the hinge, improving the screen and making it work better as a tablet. With an eight-gen Intel CPU and NVIDIA 1060 graphics, it's certainly powerful, and incredibly light for a hybrid laptop/tablet at 4.2 pounds.  As mentioned, pre-orders start today for the 15-inch model in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Over the next few months, both the 13- and 15-inch models will go on sale in Bahrain, China, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Korea, Kuwait, Malaysia, Oman, Portugal, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Spain, Taiwan, Thailand and the United Arab Emirates.

Search For Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) researchers want to build out their operations at two facilities, BBC reported, but they can't find GPUs to buy.  "We'd like to use the latest GPUs [graphics processing units]... and we can't get 'em," SETI chief scientist Dan Werthimer told the BBC. "This is a new problem, it's only happened on orders we've been trying to make in the last couple of months."  Crudely speaking, cryptocurrency miners harness the great processing power of GPUs to work out complex math problems that, when solved, grant coin portions as a payday. SETI researchers need the high-performing processors to scan many communications frequencies at once to ensure they don't miss out on an extraterrestrial's potential call; Berkeley SETI alone has 100 GPUs.  Facilities in Green Bank, West Virginia and Parkes, Australia are trying to expand, which the shortage is preventing: "We've got the money, we've contacted the vendors, and they say, 'we just don't have them'," Werthimer told the BBC.  Last June, AMD and NVIDIA tried to stem the tide by announcing new graphics cards specifically for the cryptocurrency mining market, and Samsung followed suit with its own GPU last month. But that hasn't made them easier for everyone else to buy. NVIDIA might be apologizing for the shortage all the way to the bank after rising profits last quarter, but the real tragedy might not be all the sweet gaming hours lost like tears in rain -- it could be the alien missive gone unnoticed while humans whip their GPUs to puzzle out more digital money.

BII  This story was delivered to BI Intelligence "E-Commerce Briefing" subscribers hours before appearing on Business Insider. To be the first to know, please click here.  JD.com reported its Q4 2017 results, with net revenue growing 38.7% year-over-year (YoY) to 110 billion yuan ($16.9 billion) for the quarter, while GMV grew to 403.4 billion yuan ($63.6 billion), a 33% YoY increase.  The revenue growth, while impressive, marked a deceleration from 39% YoY revenue growth in Q3 2017. Growth in revenue also failed to outpace mounting expenses in fulfillment, marketing, and most notably, in retail investments designed to head off Alibaba — the company posted a net loss for Q4 of 909 million yuan ($140 million).  The company's domestic and international growth efforts came at a heavy price:  Alibaba, Tencent, and JD.com spent billions to carve up China. In an effort to counter rival Alibaba as it forces physical retailers to give up partnerships with its competitors, JD.com and Tencent, JD.com's largest shareholder, embarked on a spending spree throughout 2017. Through investments ranging from hundreds of millions of dollars to billions, the pair secured exclusive partnerships with shopping malls, convenience stores, cinemas, hotels, and other commercial businesses across China.

Fulfillment costs are swelling in China and overseas. To power international expansion and maintain its domestic leadership in China, JD.com invested dearly in fulfillment, including procurement, warehousing, and delivery. Fulfillment costs rose to 8 billion yuan ($1.2 billion) in Q4, a 45.7% YoY increase. JD.com ended the year operating 486 warehouses, a 90% YoY increase from 256 warehouses in 2016. To maintain momentum in 2018, JD Logistics, JD.com's logistics arm, which was made into its own business in April 2017, raised $2.5 billion from multiple investors in a funding round announced two weeks ago.

Marketing costs to compete on Singles' Day are rising.JD.com's marketing expenses grew to 4.7 billion yuan ($0.7 billion) in the fourth quarter, up 35% YoY. A major factor behind those rising costs was marketing for Singles' Day 2017, which paid off in the form of $19.1 billion in transaction volume for JD.com, more than 50% higher than a year earlier. The leading beneficiary of Singles' Day is Alibaba, which generated $25.3 billion in revenue on that day.  International growth plans are key to JD.com's success in 2018. Outside of China, JD.com's war against Alibaba is fiercest in Southeast Asia. The region is critical because it will see its internet economy grow to $200 billion by 2025, according to Google estimates cited by TechCrunch. In 2017, JD.com's investments in Southeast Asia expanded beyond its beachhead in Indonesia, for example, through large investments in e-commerce companies in Thailand and Vietnam. A key factor behind JD.com's overall success in 2018 will be whether the firm can grow its volume in Southeast Asia against mounting competitive pressure form Alibaba and others.

BEIJING—The Chinese government is considering plans that would allow shares in technology giants such as Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to trade back home, a move that could raise the profile of the country’s tightly controlled capital markets.  The country’s securities regulator has reached out to a number of state-owned investment banks to explore ways to let already-listed companies and private businesses issue shares on the mainland, according to investment bankers briefed on the discussions.  ‘The government has a long-term plan to wean these companies off the U.S.’ —Paul Gillis, Peking University’s Guanghua School of Management  One option being considered is to allow such companies to issue depositary receipts, so they can bypass Chinese law prohibiting firms incorporated overseas from going public on the mainland. The likes of Tencent and Alibaba are incorporated abroad in a special corporate structure so they can get around Chinese restrictions on foreigners investing in sectors like technology.  It is part of China’s longer-term goal to turn the tide on years of the country’s businesses going public overseas. Beijing would like to see more Chinese companies choose the mainland capital market as their primary listing destination eventually, the investment bankers said.  “At some point, it makes sense for Alibaba and Tencent to have their primary listings in China,” said Paul Gillis, an accounting professor at Peking University’s Guanghua School of Management. “The government has a long-term plan to wean these companies off the U.S.”  “This would be a step in that direction,” he said.  Tencent and Alibaba are already among the world’s most valuable companies, and China has earmarked frontier technologies such as artificial intelligence as important growth drivers for the country’s economy.  Shares in Hong Kong-listed Tencent—the owner of China’s most popular messaging app, WeChat—more than doubled last year. In the process Tencent became the first Chinese technology company to crack the $500 billion valuation club, joining industry titans such as Facebook Inc. and Apple Inc.  NYSE-listed shares of Alibaba, China’s largest e-commerce company, almost doubled last year. Alibaba now has a market capitalization of more than $460 billion.  In recent days, a number of tech companies said they are open to a China listing, though executives haven’t gone into details. Tencent Chief Executive Pony Ma said the company would “actively consider” listing inside China. Baidu Inc. Chairman Robin Li said recently that the search-engine company has “always wanted to come home to China.” Richard Liu, chairman of Nasdaq-listed e-commerce company JD.com Inc., said “if the authorities allow it, we are willing.” The executives were speaking on the sidelines of China’s annual legislative meetings, currently taking place in Beijing.  Chinese technology firms have in the past often opted for overseas listings, many in the U.S., for the prestige and to benefit from rules allowing dual-class share structures that give company owners more control over the business. The Chinese regulator’s tough listing rules, such as the requirement for companies to be profitable for three years before listing, have also deterred high-growth technology firms from seeking direct share sales at home.  The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month that Chinese regulators have already approached smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp., which has plans to go public in Hong Kong. Investors say it would be sensible for China’s technology companies to list at home, given the brand awareness they command there and the likelihood their shares would trade at high valuations.  Still, analysts have some concerns. Depending on how contracts are drawn up, Chinese individual investors buying depository receipts could lack full shareholder rights, they say. The listings of a few hot names could also fuel speculation by Chinese individual investors, who dominate trading on the mainland.  “When the government is supporting something, everyone rushes in,” said T.J. Wong, a professor of business administration and accounting at the University of Southern California’s Marshall School of Business. “What you don’t want is a huge bubble, then a burst.”  Chinese companies often have to wait years before getting approval from the market regulator to list their shares. The authorities would likely expedite this process for some tech firms, the investment bankers said.  Letting a number of top-quality companies issue shares on the mainland could help the Chinese market mature, analysts said. Beijing’s goal, said one foreign banker, is to “take the winners.”  It isn’t clear when the regulator would formally invite specific companies into its market, given that changes to Chinese securities law would need high-level leadership approval.  —Yoko Kubota contributed to this article.
