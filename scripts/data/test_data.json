[{"article": "CHICAGO/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc on Tuesday rolled out a new iPad and classroom software aimed at grabbing more of the U.S. education market, but did not cut the price of its entry-level tablet despite schools flocking to laptops costing a third less.  Apple is looking to reassert dominance in U.S. schools, where inexpensive laptops running software from Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google and Microsoft Corp now top iPad by sales, offering a cheap way to get to cloud-based productivity tools.  The new iPad has a more powerful computing chip and an extensive set of new, free software for teachers to manage students and schoolwork. But the unchanged starting price of $299 for students and $329 for the general public, without a keyboard or case, compares with less than $200 for some Windows and Google Chrome models.  Apple shares were down 1.4 percent to $170.26 after the event, slightly better than the NASDAQ Composite, which was down 1.6 percent in midday trading.  Some analysts had believed Apple might cut prices, but the company stuck with its more traditional approach of packing more features into a device.  Despite the new software, Apple faces a tough battle in the educational market given the popularity of Google and Microsoft\u2019s productivity suites, said Carolina Milanesi of Creative Strategies. Google\u2019s G Suite fueled Chromebook sales because it was seen as easy to use to manage assignments.  \u201cMost teachers don\u2019t look past G Suite for education,\u201d she said.  Apple, as part of its response, on Tuesday announced improvements in its iWork suite at an event in Chicago, where school bells and announcements over a public address system directed press and more than 300 teachers into an auditorium at Lane Tech College Prep High School.  The event came during a spring buying season when many schools are making purchasing decisions for the upcoming school year.  \u201cWe\u2019ve been at this for 40 years and we care deeply about education,\u201d Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said at the event.  Apple executives said the new iPad works with its pencil accessory and features an upgraded A10 Fusion chip, the same CPU that powers the iPhone 7. It is available immediately.  The Apple Pencil remains priced at $99 for the public and $89 for schools, though Lenovo will release a device called Crayon for $49, the first third-party stylus to work with the iPad.  Apple's Vice-President of iOS, iPad and iPhone Product Marketing, Greg Joswiak, speaks at an education-focused event at Lane Technical College Prep High School in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., March 27, 2018. REUTERS/John Gress  Apple made up just 17 percent of the K-12 U.S. educational market in the third quarter, according to data from Futuresource Consulting. Meanwhile 60 percent of mobile computing shipments to schools ran Google\u2019s Chrome and 22 percent had Windows.  Chromebooks sold by Dell Technologies Inc cost as little as $189. Microsoft last year introduced an education-focused laptop from Lenovo Group Ltd running Windows 10 S for a similar price.  Acer Inc announced a tablet that runs Chrome OS for $329 on Monday that comes with a built-in stylus.  Apple in recent years made changes to its operating system so that more than one student can log into an iPad, and to its software to let teachers better manage students.  On Tuesday it updated iWork - which includes word processing, spreadsheet and presentation software - to allow students to take handwritten notes more easily, along with adding more free storage on its iCloud service.  Apple also released a new app called Schoolwork to help teachers create assignments and track student progress. Google has a similar app for managing student profiles, but analysts highlighted Apple\u2019s Schoolwork app as unique in helping teachers manage assignments and progress.  The previously iPad-focused Classroom teacher administration app would start working on Mac computers in June, Apple said.  In the fall Apple will roll out \u201cEveryone Can Create\u201d lessons on video, photography, music, and drawing, joining existing \u201cEveryone Can Code\u201d guides for computer programming skills.  The new courses highlight features that some low-priced laptops do not have, such as a camera and microphone.  \u201cIf you look at it as a Chromebook competitor, it\u2019s expensive. But if you look at it and say, I can do music with GarageBand, I can take pictures or use it as a video camera and now I can do (augmented reality) ... it appeals to teachers and schools that want to push the envelope on education,\u201d Milanesi said.

Apple will be told to file the transaction to the Brussels-based antitrust authority, who will take over the merger review from Austria, where it was originally declared.  Big technology mergers involving startups with insignificant revenue usually fall through the EU\u2019s usual net for checking whether deals harm competition across the bloc. However, alarmed that it nearly missed Facebook Inc.\u2019s takeover of messaging service WhatsApp, the EU is seeking to change its rules to allow it to take charge of acquisitions where a target company makes no money but holds valuable technology or intellectual property.  Apple announced its purchase of the U.K.-based app in December, for a reported $400 million, according to people familiar with the transaction, which would make it one of Apple\u2019s largest acquisitions. The Shazam app uses the microphone on a smartphone or computer to identify almost any song playing nearby, then points users to places they can listen to it, such as Apple Music or Spotify Ltd.  The acquisition would help Apple embed that capability more deeply into its music offerings. The company\u2019s digital assistant Siri was integrated with Shazam in 2014, so users could ask it what song is playing in the background.  The EU may be worried that once Shazam is under Apple\u2019s control, the iPhone maker could choose to make Apple Music the only option for listening to tracks. That could divert some of the referrals from Shazam that currently go to London-based Spotify. The acquisition also gives Apple access to a large user data base of people\u2019s musical interests.  Apple hasn\u2019t indicated that it plans to make Shazam an exclusive for Apple Music, but in the past the company has sometimes made acquired features compatible only with its products. It also has sometimes kept support for properties it\u2019s bought, for example, when Cupertino, California-based Apple acquired Beats Music to develop Apple Music, Apple released an Android version of the program.  Apple said it would work with the EU on the matter, but declined to provide further detail. The EU took up the review after Austria, Iceland, Italy, France, Norway, Spain and Sweden all asked it to do so.  The EU reviewed and approved the Facebook-WhatsApp deal after several European authorities asked the commission to step in. Facebook was later fined for misleading the EU during the merger probe. It had told the regulators it couldn\u2019t combine WhatsApp data with its other services but moved to do so shortly after the deal was finalized.  \u2014 With assistance by Mark Gurman", "stock": "AAPL", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-06", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-06/apple-shazam-deal-may-threaten-competition-in-europe-eu-says"}, {"article": "Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg hit back against Tim Cook, calling the Apple Inc.

A day after, Cook said he \"wouldn\u2019t be in this situation\" if he were in Zuckerberg\u2019s shoes, in an interview with Recode and MSNBC. While Facebook makes money selling targeted advertisements based on user data, Apple\u2019s profit comes from hardware products like the iPhone, iPad, and Mac.  Zuckerberg responded in an interview with Vox, published Monday: \"I find that argument \u2014 that if you\u2019re not paying, that somehow we can\u2019t care about you \u2014 to be extremely glib and not at all aligned with the truth.\"  \"There are a lot of people who can\u2019t afford to pay\" for a service and that having an \"advertising-supported model is the only rational model that can support building this service to reach people,\" Zuckerberg said. \"If you want to build a service which is not just serving rich people, then you need to have something that people can afford.\"  In times of crisis, tech companies sometimes huddle together to defend the industry.

Apple shares were down about 1.4 percent at $165.42 in early trade on Friday.  The iPhone X was the first phone to get a major design overhaul since the launch of the iPhone 6 in 2015, and many expected it to lead to blockbuster sales.  On Thursday, the Cupertino-based tech giant said it sold fewer iPhones over the holiday quarter than Wall Street expected, and sees revenue of $60 billion to $62 billion and gross margins of between 38 percent and 38.5 percent for its fiscal second quarter ending in March.  Analysts were expecting $65.7 billion in sales and a gross margin of 38.9 percent for the March quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Analysts at Longbow Research said the revenue guidance implied a low 50 million iPhone shipment forecast against a consensus of 58.5 million.  \"We now forecast 221 million iPhone shipments for fiscal 2018, versus the prior 235 million consensus.\"  On Thursday, Apple also said it was planning, over time, to \"target a capital structure that is approximately net neutral,\" adding that it will \"take that balance down from $163 billion to zero,\" referring to Apple's level of cash net of debt.  The comments sent its shares up about 3 percent Thursday after the bell.  \"iPhone sell-through appears to have declined in the December quarter, which, along with weaker-than-expected  second quarter revenue guidance, reinforces our view of a saturated market,\" KeyBanc analysts said in a note, cutting the rating on the stock to \"sector weight\" from \"overweight.\"\"Further, gross margin results and guidance both missed our expectations, which reduces our view of potential profit growth going forward.\"  Of 39 analysts who cover the stock, 29 rate it 'buy' or higher. However, the mixed results triggered varied responses from analysts. At least three brokerages raised their target price on the company's stock largely banking on the possibility of cash returns, while three cut price targets.  \"(Apple's) cash return should support the stock, but we see little to drive upside,\" KeyBanc analysts said.

Major technology companies are battling for dominance in U.S. schools, a market seen as important for hooking young consumers.  Apple in March 2017 lowered the price of its 9.7-inch tablet to $329, the lowest starting price ever for one of its full-sized tablets. But laptops running operating systems by Alphabet Inc's Google or Microsoft Corp can be had for less than $200.  Apple's previous price cutting, along with software changes, have been followed by an improvement in iPad sales. Analysts believe the teacher- and student-geared event on Tuesday at Lane Tech College Prep High School will include an update to its iPad lineup, including possibly a lower-priced model.

The tech giant, in announcing the sales date Tuesday, didn\u2019t explain why the product missed a promised December ship date. The HomePod can be preordered online beginning Friday.  Market leaders Amazon.com Inc. AMZN -1.22% and Alphabet Inc. GOOGL -0.12% continued to sell Echo and Google Home devices during the holidays, while Apple worked on a rival product it said wasn\u2019t ready for sale.  Amazon was the first major tech company to enter the smart-speaker market in late 2014, opening a wide lead by selling more than 20 million Echos even before tallying sales for the recent Christmas season. Its hockey puck-sized Echo Dot is estimated to account for more than half of Amazon\u2019s speaker unit sales, largely because of its lower price, which dropped to $30 during the holidays before rising to $50.  The smart-speaker shipments world-wide are expected to rise more than 50% this year to 56 million units, according to the market researcher Canalys. The U.S. will account for more than half of those sales, it said.  At $349, the HomePod costs considerably more than Amazon\u2019s latest Echo and a Google Home, whose list prices are $100 and $129, respectively.  Apple has tried to differentiate its speaker by emphasizing sound quality, particularly when playing music, over the device\u2019s ability to perform tasks.  Voice-activated speakers have moved to the forefront in a battle over what some technology analysts see as the future of computing. Virtual assistants such as Apple\u2019s Siri, Amazon\u2019s Alexa, Microsoft Corp.\u2019s Cortana and Google Assistant are expected to be embedded in more than 4 billion consumer devices by the end of 2018, allowing people to perform simple computing tasks by voice such as searching for information or turning off lights, according to the research firm IHS Markit.

WSJ's Joanna Stern recaps what you need to know about the most important announcements (Originally published Sept. 8, 2017) .  Apple\u2019s Siri has a much wider presence by virtue of being featured on more than a billion iPhones and iPads. However, Amazon and Google are aiming to catch up by cutting deals to put their assistants into such products as Toyota Motor Corp. vehicles and Sony Corp. televisions. They also offer greater functionality; Amazon\u2019s Alexa, for example, can perform thousands of commands compared with hundreds by Siri.  The HomePod was the latest in a series of Apple products that faced delayed. The AirPods earbuds missed their promised ship date last year, and the Apple Watch, promised in early 2015, arrived late in April of that year.  Apple said the HomePod initially will be available in the U.S., U.K. and Australia, and will arrive in France and Germany this spring.

Real-estate private equity firm Walton Street Capital has hired Eastdil Secured to market the Norman Foster-designed Apple Store that opened last fall and has become a popular new attraction along the reinvigorated Chicago River waterfront.  Walton last year paid $370 million for the Apple Store, which at the time was under development, along with 401 N. Michigan Ave., the 35-story office and retail building next door.  Now the firm is hoping to sell the 20,000-square-foot Apple Store along with 10,000-square-feet of retail space in the office building for as much as $175 million, according to people familiar with the offering.  Walton would retain the office space. Real-estate investors often buy mixed-use properties and then split off the valuable retail space and sell it separately.  Eastdil and potential buyers of the Apple Store were having preliminary discussions last week at the global Mipim real estate conference in Cannes, France, according to people at the conference. Eric Mogentale, managing principal of Walton, declined comment.  The sale comes at a time when retail real-estate in general is under enormous pressure because of competition from online shopping and the contraction and failure of many big name retailers. Values of many malls and shopping centers have been falling.  Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s CEO, attended the store opening. Photo: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg News  But Apple Stores have long been the gold standard in the retail world because of the high traffic they attract. Not only do they ring up strong sales, but they also boost traffic and sales at neighboring stores.  A report by Green Street Advisors in 2016 found that average sales for 220 malls with Apple Stores came to $710 per square foot, compared with $630 per square foot for malls without Apple Stores. The study was based on a database that covered about 1,400 properties.  Apple is well aware of the power of its brand and uses it to negotiate low rents. The rent it is paying for the new Apple Store in Chicago is well below the average $400 to $500 per square foot being paid nearby along Michigan Avenue, in an upscale retail area known as the Magnificent Mile, said people familiar with the matter.  Apple began discussing the new Chicago store more than two years ago with Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who has made development of the Chicago River waterfront a big priority. More than $60 million was spent on the standalone store, which has a 32-foot-tall glass fa\u00e7ade and a thin carbon roof.  The project included the redevelopment of the surrounding plaza area so that now Michigan Avenue is linked to the riverfront by granite staircases on either side of the store. The plaza, once cut off from the water, now \u201cflows effortlessly down to the river,\u201d Jony Ive, Apple\u2019s chief design officer, said when the store opened.  The store opened in October in a ceremony attended by Mr. Emanuel and Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook.  Apple officials describe the store as the company\u2019s most ambitious partly because of its design and its connection to the river. The store is also bringing in well-known professionals to teach Apple device users about the products, an experience that isn\u2019t available at most other Apple stores around the world.

WSJ's Joanna Stern has tips on how to defuse the situation. Photo: Natalia Osipova/The Wall Street Journal.  Every night, I compose the following letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook :  Dear Mr. Cook,  Your iCloud storage is full.  Yours,  Joanna Stern  I never send it because I\u2019m not as unsympathetic as Apple, which by my count blasts out millions of annoying out-of-iCloud-storage alerts a day. Hey look! You got one just now.  I call them iCloud ransom notes. Don\u2019t pay Apple for storage and the threats will persist and all your data will be unsafe. Pay and the messages will end. Plus, you\u2019ll get some\u2026 iCloud. Whatever that is.  Apple is pretty matter-of-fact about it: \u201cWe notify our customers when they need more storage to continue to keep their information safely backed up in iCloud,\u201d a spokesman says.  If you have an iPhone, you\u2019ve probably seen one of these. Apple sends notifications to millions of customers when they need more storage space so their information remains safely backed up in iCloud. These messages can be avoided. Photo: APPLE  Yet after the holiday iPhone buying season, I began to realize that many of even the most tech-savvy people in my life don\u2019t quite understand how iCloud works. Heck, I had to go to an Apple Store\u2019s iCloud class to get some clarity. And my dad didn\u2019t know he had \u201cthe iCloud\u201d until he remembered the $1 monthly charge.  So I decided to tackle the messy, many-tendriled storage system. What do we need to understand? What does Apple need to start doing better? The following guide helps those who pay for iCloud get their money\u2019s worth\u2014and those who refuse to pay for iCloud live a happier, notification-free life.  What is iCloud?  Lose your iPhone but have iCloud? You won\u2019t lose much at all. That\u2019s the simplest way to understand this thing.  If your photos, videos, contacts and more are backed up to iCloud, they\u2019re safe and accessible from any other Apple device\u2014and most web browsers\u2014by just logging in. For a quick overview of what you actually have stored, log into icloud.com with your Apple ID and poke around.  Here\u2019s the big catch, though: Apple offers only 5 gigabytes of free iCloud storage space. That\u2019s like offering a Siberian tiger a Tic Tac for dinner. With the amount of photos and videos we take today, it\u2019s not enough. For a company with about $270 billion in the bank, I\u2019d expect it to at least match Google\u2019s 15GB of free cloud storage\u2014or beat it. Do I hear 20GB?  If you do need more, Apple charges you: $1 a month for 50GB, $3 for 200GB, $10 for 2 terabytes.  Before we dive into the rest, take out your iPhone. Go to Settings, then tap your name up top, then tap iCloud. You should be looking at a handy bar graph of your own iCloud storage allotment.  Photo: The Wall Street Journal  Chances are your bar graph is going to be dominated by two big chunks:  Backups. When your device is on Wi-Fi, locked and charging, iCloud automatically backs up all the data\u2014messages, settings, your homescreen layout, app data and more.  Photos. The Photos app has a clever trick: It uploads shots as soon as you take them. This iCloud Photo Library setting is on by default; if you turn it off, photos and videos are included in backups.  If that bar graph is getting filled up, you\u2019re probably starting to get those nagging out-of-storage notifications, which brings us to Mr. Frost\u2019s two diverging roads.  Road 1: Fine, I\u2019ll Pay  OK, so you agree to pay Apple every month.  First, you\u2019ve got to decide on a plan, and the new iCloud storage family sharing is incentive to pay for the 200GB or 2TB plans. Since last fall\u2019s iOS 11 release, you can share those buckets of storage with up to five members of your family. Don\u2019t worry, Johnny, if you upload a photo of your new vape, Mom won\u2019t be able to see it.  Whichever plan you choose should cover your phone backups and all-important photo storage. But you still need to fine-tune the way photos are handled.  On your iPhone, go to Settings, then scroll down and tap Photos. If you are worried about running out of space on your iPhone itself, select \u201cOptimize iPhone Storage.\u201d  Photo: The Wall Street Journal  This ensures that full-resolution photos and videos are stored in iCloud. You\u2019ll still see preview images on the phone, but it sometimes takes a few seconds before you can view the sharp original pic.  How do you tell what is actually backed up? You should see the update status on the bottom of the first Photos tab.  Once your backups are on track and your photos are squared away, you may find you have leftover space. This is where iCloud Drive comes into play. You can dump random files into it through the iCloud web interface, or\u2014on a Mac with the latest OS\u2014sync your Desktop and Documents files.  On iPads and iPhones, there\u2019s a new Files app, which is, confusingly, another door to iCloud Drive. Plus, you can add files in iOS through supported Apple apps such as Pages, Keynote and Notes, or through the sharing function: Tap the share button, then \u201cSave to Files.\u201d  While you can use iCloud Drive to sync files across your multiple devices, it still lacks some of the basics you get with Google Drive or Dropbox. For instance, on iCloud.com you can\u2019t upload a folder of files from your desktop.  Road 2: Nope, Not Paying  OK, you\u2019ve bought a phone for $700 or more and decided not even $1 more for Apple. Understandable.  So how do you survive with just 5GB and make the ransom notes cease? First, try to clear room. Delete backups of your old devices by going to iCloud > Manage Storage > Backup.  Photo: The Wall Street Journal  Apple doesn\u2019t offer a way to see the thousands of compressed files in these old backups. There are third party apps, such as AnyTrans, that do.  You can also thin out your current backup: Tap on the backup labeled \u201cThis iPhone\u201d then turn off third-party apps. There\u2019s no real need to back up apps like Twitter and Facebook ; just back up games that save your progress.  If that isn't enough, turn off iCloud backup altogether (iCloud > iCloud Backup). You can still manually back up your iPhone by syncing to iTunes\u2014even via Wi-Fi.  Backing up photos, of course, remains a necessity. For that, I recommend Google Photos, since it offers unlimited cloud storage for photos and videos. Photos with resolution over 16 megapixels will be downsized, but you can use Google\u2019s included 15GB of storage to keep those higher-resolution shots.  I find the transition process to be cleanest on a computer. Pull all the photos you have from your phone\u2014plus any photos that may live in your iCloud storage\u2014into the Photos app on your Mac, then go to File > Export. On Windows, use the iCloud for Windows app.  Go to Google Photos, then either drag all your photos to it, or use the uploader tool. Back on your iPhone or iPad, in the iCloud settings, turn off iCloud Photo Library and download the Google Photos app.  I leave you here with a moral challenge: Every time a storage-full message makes you mad, take to social media and urge Apple to give us 20GB free. Or just pay Apple the damn dollar.

REUTERS/Brian Snyder/File Photo  The figure was cited by plaintiffs suing Microsoft for systematically denying pay raises or promotions to women at the world\u2019s largest software company. Microsoft denies it had any such policy.  The lawsuit, filed in Seattle federal court in 2015, is attracting wider attention after a series of powerful men have left or been fired from their jobs in entertainment, the media and politics for sexual misconduct.  Plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys are pushing to proceed as a class action lawsuit, which could cover more than 8,000 women.  More details about Microsoft\u2019s human resources practices were made public on Monday in legal filings submitted as part of that process.  The two sides are exchanging documents ahead of trial, which has not been scheduled.  Out of 118 gender discrimination complaints filed by women at Microsoft, only one was deemed \u201cfounded\u201d by the company, according to the unsealed court filings.  Attorneys for the women described the number of complaints as \u201cshocking\u201d in the court filings, and said the response by Microsoft\u2019s investigations team was \u201clacklustre.\u201d  Companies generally keep information about internal discrimination complaints private, making it unclear how the number of complaints at Microsoft compares to those at its competitors.  In a statement on Tuesday, Microsoft said it had a robust system to investigate concerns raised by its employees, and that it wanted them to speak up.  Microsoft budgets more than $55 million a year to promote diversity and inclusion, it said in court filings. The company had about 74,000 U.S. employees at the end of 2017.  Microsoft said the plaintiffs cannot cite one example of a pay or promotion problem in which Microsoft\u2019s investigations team should have found a violation of company policy but did not.  U.S. District Judge James Robart has not yet ruled on the plaintiffs\u2019 request for class action status.  A Reuters review of federal lawsuits filed between 2006 and 2016 revealed hundreds containing sexual harassment allegations where companies used common civil litigation tactics to keep potentially damning information under wraps.  Microsoft had argued that the number of womens\u2019 human resources complaints should be secret because publicizing the outcomes could deter employees from reporting future abuses.  A court-appointed official found that scenario \u201cfar too remote a competitive or business harm\u201d to justify keeping the information sealed.", "stock": "MSFT", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-13", "source": "reuters", "url": "https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-microsoft-women/microsoft-women-filed-238-discrimination-and-harassment-complaints-court-documents-idUKKCN1GP077"}, {"article": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp on Tuesday backed the Justice Department\u2019s request that the U.S. Supreme Court dismiss a case pitting the two against each other over whether prosecutors can force technology companies to hand over data stored overseas after Congress passed a law that resolved the dispute.

The slip left it at risk of its worst weekly retreat since June. The tumble -- almost 1 percent from its pre-market high -- comes hours before Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. are scheduled to report.  Volatility is rising in computer and software makers. An options-derived gauge of turbulence in the Nasdaq 100 Index touched its highest level Tuesday since the election of President Donald Trump. Along with uneven quarterly results, investors are dealing with stiffening resolve among Federal Reserve policy makers toward inflation and the highest bond yields in four years.  Weakness Thursday was driven by PayPal, which fell 8.2 percent; Nvidia, which lost 2.1 percent3nt and Netflix, which lost 0.3 percent.  Apple was down 0.2 percent, falling for the third time this week, amid concerns about sales of its flagship iPhone abound. Deutsche Bank said in a note late Monday that the iPhone X is too expensive and Wall Street expectations for fiscal second and third quarters are overly optimistic.  Facebook rose 2.1 percent, paring a gain of as much as 3,.5 percent. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, said the company\u2019s advertising business is \u201cstrong,\u201d despite weakness in key areas -- time spent and average daily users. Fourth-quarter sales rose 47 percent year-over-year to $12.97 billion, topping estimates. The stock initially fell as much as 5.2 percent in after-hours trading after the company reported a drop in time spent by users on the site and the first-ever decline in North American daily users.  Microsoft results were buoyed by brisk demand for online versions of its productivity programs, including Word and Excel, and the company\u2019s business of selling storage and other computing tasks in its own data centers. Sales in the fiscal second quarter climbed 12 percent to $28.9 billion, exceeding the average analyst estimate of $28.4 billion.  The stock was down 0.4 percent Thursday morning.  EBay Inc. gave an optimistic revenue forecast for the current quarter, boosting investor confidence in the company\u2019s efforts to generate more traffic on the site. Gross merchandise volume, a key metric, rose 10 percent to $24.4 billion in the fourth quarter, the company said Wednesday, as the number of active buyers on the platform increased. The stock was up 13.1 percent.  Some of the other big tech companies reporting Wednesday struck a more somber tone.  Qualcomm Inc., a key Apple supplier, gave revenue and profit forecasts that underscored weakening demand for smartphones. Sales will be $4.8 billion to $5.6 billion in the current quarter, while analysts are predicting revenue of $5.6 billion. Earnings per share, excluding some items, will be 65 cents to 75 cents, short of the 86 cents predicted by analysts. The shares fell 1.3 percent.

Peggy Johnson is the executive vice president for business development at Microsoft. Business Insider/Michael Seto  Peggy Johnson is the executive vice president for business development at Microsoft.  Before Microsoft, she spent 25 years at Qualcomm, on the technical side as an engineer and on the business side.  As \"deal-maker-in-chief,\" Peggy Johnson gets paid millions to help make Microsoft billions.  Her actual title is executive vice president for business development, and she's helped lead over 40 investments with Microsoft Ventures. One deal was the acquisition of LinkedIn \u2014 for $26 billion.  \"It takes an army for sure,\" Johnson said on Business Insider's podcast, \"Success! How I Did It,\" about making those investments. \"Clearly, one of that size needs to be assessed fully, and we have fantastic teams across the company who are so good at that assessment.\"  She joined the company three years ago after spending 25 years at the telecommunications company Qualcomm. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella personally called her on a Saturday to get her on board.  Business Insider US Editor-in-Chief Alyson Shontell recently caught up with Johnson at the World Economic Forum, in Davos, Switzerland. On this episode of \"Success, How I Did It,\" Johnson talks about making it to Microsoft and how her team decides which companies to invest in or acquire.

Microsoft's Peggy Johnson, right, spoke with Business Insider US Editor-in-Chief Alyson Shontell at the World Economic Forum, in Davos, Switzerland, in January 2018. Business Insider  To understand Peggy Johnson and the qualities that have made her successful, you have to know about her family. She was the 14th of 15 kids. As a child she was a quiet listener who learned to read her siblings' facial expressions from the kitchen countertop (with so many people, her chair wouldn't fit around the family table). Eventually Johnson followed some of her brothers and sisters to San Diego State University, where she started studying business, even though she really loved math and science. It was there that a chance encounter changed her life's trajectory.  Peggy Johnson: My parents had two rules: You had to go to college, and you had to pay for it yourself. So we all did. I was delivering mail and happened to deliver mail to the engineering department one day. Two ladies at the end of this long hallway with linoleum floors could hear me coming, and they were super excited to see me \u2014 like more excited than they should've been just because I was delivering mail.  It was because they thought I was there to ask about engineering. And they were disappointed. They said, \"We thought you wanted to know something about the School of Engineering.\" I said, \"Nope \u2014 just delivering the mail.\" They said, \"Well, do you know anything about engineering?,\" and I said, \"You know, absolutely nothing.\"  No one had ever really talked to me about engineering, and so they asked me the same question, \"Do you like math and science?\" I said, \"I love it.\" They just started to work on me, and after 15 to 20 minutes I felt, like, \"You know, this might be something I want to do.\"  The next day I changed my major to engineering \u2014 yeah, to electrical engineering.  Alyson Shontell: Wow.  Johnson: I credit those two ladies. They just, you know, worked on me and changed my mind.  Shontell: They changed your life.  Johnson: My life. The whole trajectory of my life really changed in that conversation.  Shontell: So you wound up getting a job at GE after this great electrical-engineering major. And you spent a couple years there.  Johnson: Yeah, I started as an intern while I was still at school, and again, San Diego State put me on a great course because they had a number of great internship opportunities, and this area of General Electric was in their military electronics division. I worked on anti-submarine warfare for surface ships. So it sounds very interesting, I'm sure. You want to know more about that, but I can't say anything because I had a clearance.  But it was a job I might still be in today if not for it seemed like it was going to move to Syracuse, New York, and of course I was in San Diego, California, but I didn't want to move, and well, \"I've got to look for a job here in San Diego,\" and ended up saying no to GE.  Johnson spent 25 years working her way up the ladder  Johnson worked at Qualcomm for 25 years on both the technical engineering side and the business side. Thomson Reuters  Shontell: Is that when you went to Qualcomm?  Johnson: Yes, and I just answered an ad in the newspaper, which they don't do anymore. You probably never even heard of that, but yes, that's how you used to get jobs, look through the newspaper.  Shontell: In the classifieds.  Johnson: The classifieds, and there it was. It was this new company, and they were hiring, and my husband had had an internship at the predecessor to Qualcomm, called Linkabit. He said, \"You know, Irwin Jacobs is an amazing man.\" He had owned and been in Linkabit, and he said, \"I don't know what Qualcomm does, but I think you should \u2014 \"  Shontell: He's the founder of Qualcomm?  Johnson: Irwin Jacobs is, yeah. And so prodded by my husband, who was at that time pursuing his master's degree, and we were married, and one of us needed to work, and that was me. So I went in, had an interview. Hardest interview of my life, and ended up getting the job, and stayed there for 25 years.  Shontell: Yeah, it's incredible. But while you had a long career there, at first it seemed as if you were soft-spoken and it was hard to kind of get your point across in a loud room with those guys.  Johnson: It was.  And I'm soft-spoken probably going back to the family experience. Number 14 out of 15 wasn't an enviable position to be in. You were just one of so many voices at the table, and I was one who had to sit at the side table. So I was at the kids' table until I was, like, 24 years old.  So I was more of a listener, and I was quiet largely because I couldn't ever really break in to that chaos at the big table. But I was a listener and I would watch people, and I would try to understand their mood. Those skills were what I brought into my job at Qualcomm, and maybe not great skills, because when I got to Qualcomm the expectation really at that time was, \"You need to speak up more. You need to be more assertive in meetings. We want to hear from you more.\" Whenever I did that, whenever I tried to be what I wasn't, it didn't really turn out very well, and I didn't feel very authentic, and in fact people would kind of look at me \u2014 \"Why is she being so assertive and aggressive here? That's not like her.\" And it wasn't. It wasn't my authentic self.  So pretty much I had decided, \"I think I have to leave the industry, the company. I'm just not suited for this.\" My manager at the time said, \"No, we are going to figure this out. You're going to stay right where you are,\" and really I credit him for making a lot of changes in the HR department at the time because we were ranked by certain attributes that I didn't have. So I remember being marked off for not being aggressive and assertive in meetings, and he said, \"We are going to change this, and we are going to make sure we have a broader set of qualities that we're looking for.\" Things like teamwork and being collaborative, and he really pushed. It was early, early days, and things changed from that point on. Once I was able to be my more authentic self I felt like that's when my career really took off. I was just my own voice.  Shontell: Yes, so he sort of gave you permission to be yourself and helped you find your own leadership style.  Johnson: He did, yes. I always credit him for that because I might have just left like, I think, a lot of women did at the time. They just didn't feel comfortable and it didn't feel like a very inclusive environment, and he helped change that.  Shontell: So you go on to stay for many, many more years at Qualcomm \u2014 25 years.  Johnson: Yes.  Shontell: What made you so dedicated to that one company?  Johnson: Right, yes. So first of all, Qualcomm's a great company, and they gave me the opportunity to really thrive in a number of roles. So I was an engineer to start with, and I was in the engineering department for several years. Then I had been going out on business trips because we needed to explain the product to the industry we were selling into, and on one of the flights home the general manager happens to be sitting next to me and he said, \"I don't understand. Why don't you just come over to the business side? You really seem to love doing that, and I like the way you translate the technical world into the business world. I think you could be well suited for that.\"  And I thought, \"Well, thank you very much but no, thank you. I'm an engineer.\" I identified with being an engineer, and I remember thinking engineering at that time at Qualcomm was in one building, and all the business people were in the other building, and we made fun of them all the time because they dressed up, and we got to wear our Qualcomm shirts and jeans. We thought we didn't want to have anything to do with that world, but it started to weigh on me, and probably four or five weeks went by, and I remember sitting at our holiday party, and all of sudden I had one of those aha moments, and it was:\" \"You need to do this. You need to make that leap.\" Because while I liked what I did, I loved being in front of the customer. So I did, and I moved over into program management, which is sort of a technical and business role, and that was really the start of my business career at Qualcomm.  Shontell: So you switched from engineering to the business-development side, and that's when things really took off.  Johnson: Yeah, and I think part of it was the time. It was early days of the mobile phones. We were making the digital standard that was eventually embedded into mobile phones in the US, and so everything was exciting and new. We were forging new paths, and it was such a great time to be at the start of a business. None of us had any idea what it would turn into. I don't think any of us at that time envisioned that everybody would be carrying cellphones. I mean, we thought, \"That'll be a good business. Maybe a few million of those will sell.\" So it was fun to be there at the start of that, but I had great managers along the way, and any time I wanted to do something different they really supported me.  Shontell: And switching careers isn't easy. I mean, it's a big risk.  Johnson: Exactly. It is, and you're not quite sure, and if it doesn't work out, can I go back? Once I switched over I had to learn a lot. Clearly I didn't have a business degree, and a lot of it was on-the-job learning, but I had some great mentors and folks who leaned in and helped me. And I just loved every hat I wore after that point, until I moved on to Microsoft from Qualcomm.  How Johnson decided to make the leap and start a new career at Microsoft  Johnson was recruited by Satya Nadella as his first big hire after becoming Microsoft's CEO in 2014. Microsoft  Shontell: It sounds like you had a great setup. You established yourself through the ranks, had great mentorship. So Microsoft calls. You'd been rejecting other calls before, kind of just hanging up the phone on recruiters. What was it about Microsoft?  Johnson: Well, I wouldn't call them back. I wouldn't hang up on them.  Shontell: OK: You were polite about it.  Johnson: That's it. But it was one of those interesting times. I hadn't ever called any back because everything was great at Qualcomm. I loved it, and also I was living in San Diego, my family was there. Everything was fantastic, but at the time of the industry Satya had just taken over, Satya Nadella, as CEO of Microsoft. We did business with Microsoft. We sold them chips, and so we know, of course, of Microsoft. We didn't really know Satya, and one of the first things he did is he decided to put Office on IOS and Android phones, and that blew us away. I mean, probably not just us in Qualcomm, but the industry.  That was quite a bold move, and so when I got the call from Microsoft they said, \"Well, it's a job reporting to Satya. You'd be running business development.\" I thought, \"I just want to call back to understand what it's about. The company seems to be in this big transition, and I just want to learn a little bit basically.\" But of course was never going to go anywhere. I lived in San Diego there wasn't any question that I was going anywhere. When I called back I was just drawn in, and eventually I had a conversation with Satya.  Shontell: He called you on a Saturday.  Johnson: He did, yeah. He did, and so I was chatting with him, and again it was kind of like another aha moment. He was talking about his world view of a mobile-first, cloud-first world, and all of a sudden it just connected with me because obviously I'd been living in a mobile-first world, a wireless world. That was what I knew inside and out. I felt very comfortable in that world. Then when data left the phone it went off to that thing called the cloud and Qualcomm didn't have much to do with that. As he was talking about this idea of ambient computing and having intelligence everywhere it just clicked with me that this is something I need to know more about, and I wanted to understand more about Satya's vision, and eventually took a trip to Seattle.  I remember getting on the plane in San Diego feeling like, \"I hope nobody sees me because I've never done this before. I'm gonna go visit another company for a job possibly.\" And had a chance to meet the rest of the management team, and then to sit down with Satya. His vision to empower every person and organization on the planet, to achieve more, it just struck me, and it resonated with me, and I ended up saying yes, making the move with my family. We had only one child at home at that time, and so we moved up to Seattle, where I live today.  Shontell: He's done incredible things with Microsoft.  Johnson: He has, absolutely.  Shontell: What's he like to work with?  Johnson: Very empathetic. He's a listener. He's a learner. Curious. We're allowed to fail, learn from it, but it's super important. He's really changed the company at its core, and we are following a growth mindset, which he introduced to the company, and I feel like whenever we sort of get off path a little bit, we come back to the growth mindset. We'll say, \"Are we exhibiting a growth mindset here?\" You know? It's easy to say no. Any idea you can have 10 nos. It's a lot harder to say yes. So the growth mindset allows us to push boarders a little bit, and to say yes more, try things out, fail fast. I believe it's changed the core of the company, and I hear that from others outside, which is very gratifying. But what's so exciting is that the campus is energized, and it's just been a wild, crazy, fun ride for the last three years.  What it takes to be Microsoft's deal-maker-in-chief  As executive vice president for business development, Johnson has overseen more than 40 investments, including the $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn. REUTERS/Robert Galbraith  Shontell: So it's been three years. You've done a lot. One thing that stands out: You worked with a big team on the LinkedIn deal. Microsoft bought LinkedIn for $26 billion-plus.  Johnson: Yeah: $26 billion.  Shontell: So how does a $26 billion deal happen? How long did it take? What happens behind the scenes? Because most of us don't get to that level.  Johnson: It takes an army, for sure. I mean, I would say the evolution of an acquisition that big has to go through many, many gates, and it starts with sort of conversations. It starts with a strategy. \"Are we the better owners?\" Looking at it from all different angles.  Clearly, one of that size needs to be assessed fully, and we have fantastic teams across the company who are so good at that assessment. Also, the engagement, once we decided to make the decision to go forward, the engagement with the company, the integration part, which is super important. You can make all of the great strategic assessments ahead of time, but if you can't integrate well after, you've lost a lot of money. The teams at Microsoft are just first class at that.  Shontell: So is it a 10-month process? Faster?  Johnson: I can't remember. There were conversations for a long period of time, but then once we sort of pulled the trigger, I want to say \u2014 I don't know \u2014 maybe it was somewhere between six and 12 months. I can't quite remember from the time of the first conversations until we announced that we were going to proceed with an acquisition.  Shontell: When I saw the headline, and we were writing it on Business Insider, it was like, \"Oh, whoa. This is a huge deal.\" It went totally under the radar. You didn't get scooped.  Johnson: Another thing that I think we did a very good job on ... because obviously a team that size inside the company did a very good job of keeping things quiet on both sides. Including the transactional folks in between. So all of that had rolled out very, very well. It was sort of the example of how you'd like to do an acquisition.  Shontell: I'm sure you say no, of course, much more than you say yes. One that stands out is Slack, I think, was an opportunity to buy, and I think Microsoft ultimately passed, along with some others. On a deal like that, how do you weigh it?  Johnson: Well, without commenting specifically on Slack, I would say for any acquisition we ask that question, \"Are we the better owners? Does it fulfill a strategic gap that we have?\" Because many times a partnership is even better oftentimes because to be an owner you have to be all in, but if a partnership can work to fill a gap, we'll go that route. Sometimes we'll make an investment in a company because they're on a quicker path to filling a gap, but they may need a little help in the form of resources to get there. Then finally if the right answer is, \"Yes, we are the better owners,\" we'll go the full way and go forward with an acquisition.  So we do sort of an assessment that way, and we try to be very, very disciplined, and stick to our core ambitions, and not go too far off of that, because that's where you get into trouble. So we talk ourselves in and out of things often.  Johnson explains how to be a good leader  Johnson learned a lot of leadership skills growing up in a family with 15 children. Microsoft  Shontell: You've said that prioritization is a skill that you learned really early on. Do you have tips? How do you figure out, in a job as huge as yours \u2014 I'm sure you have a million different things that you could be doing \u2014 how do you focus, and how do you zero in on the right things?  Johnson: Well, I think I learned it from my mom, who is probably the program-manager-in-chief to run a house like that. Because one of the things she used to say is, \"We may have 15 kids, but we're not gonna be a messy house. When people come in the house we don't want them to say, 'Oh yeah, this is what I thought a house with 15 kids would look like.'\" So she was very disciplined. She made lists \u2014 and I love lists \u2014 and checking things off the list always feels good.  So I learned sort of that prioritization from my mom, and that it's not important to get everything on the list done but really to make sure that you set out in the morning to get the top ones done. That's what your focus should be. You shouldn't be stressed that you didn't get to the bottom of the list. She was very good at that.  Shontell: Another skill of yours is you're great, from what I've heard your coworkers say, you're great at building these relationships that last a long time. Especially in that business \u2014 it's so critical to have that. How do you do that? What are your tips for building long-lasting work and general life relationships?  Johnson: I think it goes back to that family table when I was the listener in the room, and that is something that is probably a little bit underrated, but for me has been, I feel like, the core of my leadership abilities is the ability to listen, and to deeply listen, and to understand and put myself in the other person's shoes. Once you do that you can solve whatever problem there is on the table whether it's a business problem or a technical problem, I think, more quickly having that ability to put yourself on the other side.  Shontell: Then I have a kind of more general landscape question. I think someone asked you once what you thought the biggest issue women face in the workforce is, and you said harassment. Certainly we've seen a lot of stories about that this year, Harvey Weinstein on up. What do you think we can do better? How do you think we can fix it? What have you seen that makes you say that?  Johnson: Well, I just feel like you should be able to have a respectful work environment, because if you do you'll be your best self. You'll bring your best self to work, and over the years there was always that whispering at work when there was people you avoided because you didn't want a comment about your dress or something, and I think about all of the cycles that my friends and I would share, you know, \"Don't go by that person's office. Go the long way around.\" Those cycles could have been put to a lot better use. So there's kind of a business reason to stop this, and there's obviously all of the other reasons that we've been talking about since the #MeToo movement started, but there's also a basic business reason. We could be so much more productive if we didn't have to spend all those cycles sort of fending off that sometimes subtle harassment, but it sort of exists there, and if we can together say, \"Let's just have an inclusive, respectful environment at work,\" and teach our boys and our girls, I think we'll be far more productive. We'll be our best selves. We'll bring our best selves to work because we'll know we'll be in a comfortable environment.  Shontell: You've had an incredible career, many years ahead of it still, but the point that you've gotten to is just really inspiring. If you're looking back or you're giving someone advice who's just starting their career, what do you wish you had known then, and what would you advise someone who wants to rise to the top like you have?  Johnson: Well, I think the best advice I ever got was just to be myself, and I think once I settled into who I am, I'm quiet, I'm somewhat introverted, and decided that's OK, it's OK to be who I am. Then my career took off. So for someone starting I would say, \"Be who you are. If you are aggressive and assertive that's fine, too. Just embrace who you are because we really need that diversity of thought at work. We don't need a bunch of Peggy Johnsons of any one type. We really need the sort of the mix and the blend of all the different opinions and voices.\" That I think would be good advice for someone just stepping into their career.  Shontell: Thank you so much, Peggy. It's really been fun.  Johnson: Thank you, Alyson. Thanks for having me. I appreciate it.", "stock": "MSFT", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-02", "source": "business-insider", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/peggy-johnson-microsoft-linkedin-interview-2018-2"}, {"article": "Tech firms seem to be clashing more with law enforcement, though their interests needn\u2019t be irreconcilable. On Tuesday the Supreme Court will consider if U.S. internet providers can subvert federal law and public safety.  At issue in Microsoft v. U.S. is whether warrants issued under the 1986 Stored Communications Act apply to records stored on the cloud. The law allows the government to obtain records from a U.S. internet provider if there is probable cause of a crime. A special Section 2703 warrant functions like a subpoena since law enforcement doesn\u2019t directly seize records from servers.  In 2013 the U.S. government sought such a warrant for contents associated with an MSN.com email account believed to include evidence of narcotics trafficking. A federal magistrate issued a warrant covering \u201cinformation associated with\u201d the account \u201cstored at premises owned, maintained, controlled, or operated by Microsoft Corporation.\u201d  While Microsoft agreed to disclose records stored on its U.S. servers, it refused to turn over content on its \u201ccloud\u201d servers in Dublin, Ireland. The Redmond, Wash.-based company, which was held in civil contempt, says the law doesn\u2019t authorize extraterritorial warrants. It\u2019s right on this point, but wrong on everything else.  In Morrison (2010) and RJR Nabisco, Inc. (2016), the Supreme Court developed a two-step analysis to determine if a law applies overseas. First, courts must ask whether a law includes a \u201cclear, affirmative indication that [the statutory provision] applies extraterritorially.\u201d If not, the statute is presumed not to be extraterritorial.  But then courts must assess whether a case primarily \u201cinvolves a domestic application of the statute\u201d by looking at its \u201cfocus.\u201d As the Court held in Nabisco, \u201cIf the conduct relevant to the statute\u2019s focus occurred in the United States, then the case involves a permissible domestic application even if other conduct occurred abroad.\u201d  This second part is key in the Microsoft case. There\u2019s no disputing that the Stored Communications Act doesn\u2019t expressly apply to foreign parties. The government could not compel an internet provider based in France to hand over a French citizen\u2019s emails. But as the judge who issued the warrant observed, the government\u2019s application of the law \u201cdoes not criminalize conduct taking place in a foreign country\u201d and doesn\u2019t deploy U.S. cops overseas.  Employees at Microsoft headquarters could obtain records stored on foreign servers with a few keystrokes. Internet providers typically decide where to store data to maximize efficiency. Google cuts up emails into \u201cshards,\u201d which can move between countries within seconds without human intervention. U.S. internet users aren\u2019t entitled to know where in the cloud their records are stored, let alone to recourse under U.S. law if a company moves them.  A federal district judge held that the Microsoft warrant wasn\u2019t extraterritorial since the disclosure of records to the government occurs in the U.S. But a Second Circuit Court of Appeals panel disagreed in 2016, and tech companies have since resisted warrants for data stored overseas. While the circuit refused to hear the case en banc, Judges Jos\u00e9 Cabranes, Dennis Jacobs, Reena Raggi and Christopher Droney wrote an incisive dissent on the far-reaching implications of the panel\u2019s rogue ruling, which conflicts with every other district and magistrate decision.  The panel \u201chas substantially burdened the government\u2019s legitimate law enforcement efforts; created a roadmap for the facilitation of criminal activity; and impeded programs to protect the national security of the United States and its allies,\u201d the judges explained.  Tech firms argue that a Court decision upholding the government\u2019s authority to compel disclosure of data overseas would cause international friction due to conflicting legal regimes on data privacy. But more than a dozen countries including Australia, France, Ireland, Canada and the U.K. assert this authority. The U.S. would be an outlier.  They also argue that Congress is better situated to resolve the complicated issues of cloud computing that were never envisioned three decades ago. Senators Orrin Hatch and Chris Coons have introduced legislation to modernize the Stored Communications Act and clarify legal obligations for internet providers.  But pending legislation shouldn\u2019t obviate a judicial decision on a black-and-white legal question critical to public safety. Letting a flawed ruling stand would lead to more needless failures in law enforcement.", "stock": "MSFT", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-27", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsofts-legal-cloud-cover-1519689734"}, {"article": "Microsoft's new offices in Leopardstown, Ireland.

The company says it shouldn\u2019t have to hand over emails stored on a server in Ireland. Photo: NIALL CARSON/PRESS ASSOCIATION/GETTY IMAGES  WASHINGTON\u2014Technology companies will square off with law enforcement on Tuesday as the Supreme Court hears arguments on whether emails and other customer data stored overseas are subject to U.S. search warrants.  The case is one of several legal battles on law-enforcement access to private online data, and it requires the justices to interpret a law that Congress wrote before email and cloud computing were part of everyday life.  A federal appeals court, in a 2016 case involving Microsoft Corp. , handed a blow to prosecutors by ruling that such warrants can\u2019t be enforced on U.S. providers if the data is stored exclusively on foreign servers. That is the decision the Supreme Court is reviewing.  The case highlights broader tensions between tech titans, which view protecting user privacy as a priority, and authorities who believe privacy concerns should take a back seat to public safety in certain circumstances.  Battle lines have been firmly drawn, with opposing camps warning of serious harm if the court rules against their position.  The Justice Department and state attorneys general say the lower court ruling has hampered investigations into an array of crimes, from narcotics trafficking to arson to child pornography. Emails and electronic evidence are now critical to virtually every criminal investigation, they say.  Microsoft, Google and other technology companies say the Justice Department\u2019s position would leave them stuck between U.S. law enforcement and their obligation to abide by privacy laws in foreign jurisdictions. The companies also say the case could threaten American dominance in the $250 billion cloud-computing industry, because foreign clients won\u2019t use U.S. firms if their data isn\u2019t protected.  Foreign governments also have weighed in, urging the Supreme Court not to interpret U.S. law in a way that intrudes on their sovereignty.  \u201cThis may be a case in which the Supreme Court has no truly satisfying outcome available to it, in part because it is being asked to interpret a 1986 law that is not a good fit for the kind of large-scale, cross-border data-storage practices of today,\u201d said David Newman, a lawyer with Morrison & Foerster LLP who closely follows privacy and data-security issues.  The law at issue is the Stored Communications Act, passed by Congress more than 30 years ago to provide privacy protections for electronic records.  The Justice Department applied for a warrant requiring Microsoft to turn over email information from an account allegedly tied to illegal drug activity in the U.S. A magistrate judge issued the warrant after finding the government had established probable cause that the account was connected to narcotics trafficking.  Newsletter Sign-up  Microsoft handed over some account data that was stored in the U.S. but said it shouldn\u2019t have to hand over the emails, which were stored on a server in Ireland. The company said the government has never suggested that the account holder is a citizen or resident of the U.S.  The Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with Microsoft, ruling the 1986 law didn\u2019t apply beyond U.S. territory.  Microsoft said in its Supreme Court brief that the materials targeted for government seizure are covered by Irish and European Union law. That means the U.S. is seeking to assert the 1986 law beyond domestic borders, which isn\u2019t allowed, the company argued.  Microsoft conceded that U.S. law is outdated but said that was an issue for lawmakers, not judges, to address.  \u201cOnly Congress has the authority and tools to rewrite the statute to strike a new, 21st-Century balance between law-enforcement interests, our relations with foreign nations, the privacy of our citizens, and the competitiveness of our technology industry,\u201d the company said in its brief.  A bipartisan group of lawmakers has introduced legislation to tackle cross-border data issues, but it isn\u2019t clear if the bill will advance in Congress.  The Justice Department said it isn\u2019t seeking to apply the current U.S. law extraterritorially. It noted the government sought disclosure in the U.S., where officials at Microsoft\u2019s headquarters in Redmond, Wash., have ready access to files stored abroad.  \u201cMicrosoft\u2019s employees could prepare that disclosure without leaving their desks in the United States,\u201d Solicitor General Noel Francisco wrote in a court brief.  The department argued that Microsoft\u2019s position could keep investigators from accessing emails and other files even if the subject of the investigation is based in the U.S., if a company chooses to store the consumer\u2019s files overseas.  There is a diplomatic process, governed by legal assistance treaties, that allows the U.S. to request that foreign law-enforcement counterparts share sought-after data, but it can be slow and ineffective, the department said.  WSJ's Joanna Stern \"bumps\" into Peggy Johnson in the elevator at D.Live and asks about Microsoft's next big investments, Solitaire and women in technology. Photo: Andria Chamberlin for The Wall Street Journal  While the case before the court involves Microsoft, the government also took aim at Google, whose network-management practices often involve dividing data from a single customer file into chunks that are moved within an international network of data centers.  If Microsoft\u2019s arguments prevail, then Google\u2019s practices would make its data inaccessible to law enforcement, the Justice Department said.  Google has been involved in several warrant battles with federal and state authorities, agreeing to be held in contempt in some cases for failing to turn over data. The company, like Microsoft, is pushing for a legislative solution.  Since the Second Circuit ruling, legal battles between prosecutors and tech companies have continued in other jurisdictions, and several courts have ruled in the government\u2019s favor, including in California, Florida, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.  A Supreme Court decision is expected by the end of June.

Photo: Elaine Thompson/Associated Press  Microsoft Corp. MSFT -0.53% is downgrading the role of Windows, the storied franchise that put the company atop the personal-computer market at a time when cloud computing didn\u2019t exist.  Now, amid the massive shift in the way computing power is harnessed, the software giant will reorganize its business around its growing Azure cloud-computing operations and its stalwart Office productivity business.  Executive Vice President Terry Myerson, who ran the Windows business, will leave the company, according to an internal email from Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella on Thursday.  The move is designed to focus Microsoft on its biggest areas of growth. In its latest quarter Azure revenue jumped 98% while Office 365 grew 41%, though the company doesn\u2019t give totals for those segments. In the same period, the More Personal Computing unit, which includes Windows, gained 2% to $12.17 billion.  \u201cHaving a deep sense of customers\u2019 unmet and unarticulated needs must drive our innovation,\u201d Mr. Nadella said in the email he sent to employees Thursday morning. \u201cWe can\u2019t let any organizational boundaries get in the way of innovation for our customers. This is why a growth-mindset culture matters.\u201d  Microsoft declined to make executives available for comment.  In a post on Microsoft\u2019s LinkedIn page, Mr. Myerson, who has run the Windows business since 2013, said the day was an \u201cemotional\u201d one for him but expressed his \u201congoing enthusiasm for Microsoft.\u201d  For most of its 43 years, Microsoft and Windows have been nearly synonymous. Under Mr. Nadella\u2019s predecessor, Steve Ballmer, products were sometimes stalled, or even killed, because they didn\u2019t help expand the market for the operating system.  That Mr. Nadella is willing to shift the company\u2019s focus away from Windows illustrates the irreversible migration from personal computing to mobile devices and the web. It also shows how Mr. Nadella is putting his own imprint on the tech giant.  \u201cHe\u2019s clearly not handcuffed by history,\u201d said Stifel Nicolaus & Co. analyst Brad Reback.  Mr. Nadella is able to break from the past because, during his four years as chief executive, Microsoft has emerged as a leader in cloud computing. Its Azure operations is No. 2 behind Amazon.com in the cloud-infrastructure market. And its Office 365 productivity apps and its Dynamics business-software services are rapidly growing, multibillion-dollar businesses.  \u201cThe Microsoft of old could never have made this move,\u201d Mr. Reback said. \u201cBut the pieces were not in place to make the move.\u201d  Mr. Myerson, a 21-year Microsoft veteran, will leave the company and help with the transition \u201cover the coming months,\u201d Mr. Nadella wrote.  \ufeff The company is breaking Windows in pieces. The platform technology, on which Microsoft\u2019s partners build their own devices, apps and services, will now fall under Scott Guthrie, who runs the Azure business. Mr. Guthrie\u2019s unit, called Cloud + AI Platform, will also include the company\u2019s mixed-reality business, including Microsoft\u2019s Hololens device, as well as its artificial-intelligence business.  Microsoft\u2019s devices business, including its Surface lineup of computers, will fall to Rajesh Jha, who has been in charge of Microsoft\u2019s Office group. The new, bigger unit, called Experiences & Devices, will also include Microsoft\u2019s efforts to develop new features in Windows.  In his note, Mr. Nadella called the future of Windows \u201cbright,\u201d as the company pushes to develop features that take advantage of new types of devices and emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence. Nearly 700 million devices run Windows 10, the software\u2019s latest version. All told, some version of Windows is on more than 1.5 billion devices world-wide. In the most recent quarter, the More Personal Computing unit accounted for 42% of Microsoft\u2019s revenue.  \u201cThis is the most sweeping reorg that I can recall,\u201d said Brad Silverberg, who ran the Windows division when Microsoft launched its seminal Windows 95 operating system.  In the 1990s, Windows was so dominant that a federal judge ruled that it was a monopoly. The U.S. Department of Justice sought to break up Microsoft, accusing the company of abusing its dominance in the PC operating system market to crush rivals. The company ultimately signed a consent decree in 2002, agreeing, in part, to make Windows interoperable with non-Microsoft software.  While Microsoft is still focused on building the platform upon which other tech companies run their technology, that focus is now on Azure, said Mr. Silverberg, a venture capitalist who co-founded Fuel Capital, a San Francisco-based firm. He praised Mr. Nadella\u2019s acknowledgment of Windows\u2019 reduced importance.  \u201cHe recognizes the world for what it is, not what it used to be,\u201d Mr. Silverberg said.

In one way it\u2019s the best: By nearly eliminating the bezel around the display, Dell squeezed the XPS 13 into a smaller body than all of its competitors. Without those big borders, the screen just looks better. The XPS 13 scored the second-best time in my battery tests, it has all the right chips and features, and it looks like it cost good money.  But\u2026 that tiny bezel forced Dell to move the webcam down below the screen, which is a terrible place. Rather than framing my face, the camera stares up my nose. (Dell says most users don\u2019t mind the placement.)  The bigger problem is that the XPS 13 you want costs $1,200. The standard model comes with a paltry four gigs of RAM and 128 gigs of storage\u2014neither of which will suffice.  Microsoft | Surface Pro $958 Battery Looks Power  Versatility  PROS  CONS  Hard to use on your lap; low-end processor  Light, thin and versatile; most tablet-like of the bunch  The Portable One  Like the best camera, the best laptop is the one you have with you. No Windows computer combines portability and functionality quite like Microsoft Corp.\u2019s Surface Pro, the tablet/laptop hybrid that inspired so many competitors. It\u2019s the size and shape of an iPad, with the full power of Windows.  Unfortunately, all that versatility compromises the Surface Pro\u2019s utility, and I don\u2019t just mean the smaller screen. And, because the crucial keyboard accessory sells separately for $160, it\u2019s deceptively expensive. (I\u2019ve included it in my pricing, because you need it.) The only way to hit the $1,000 target and still get the whole kit is to buy the cheapest model, which uses a vastly underpowered processor. You might opt for Microsoft\u2019s other offering in this range, the Surface Laptop but, as comfortable as it is to use, it doesn\u2019t measure up to my other picks.  | Swift 3 Acer $999 Battery Looks Power  Versatility  PROS  CONS  Big and heavy; more desktop than laptop  Lots of ports; big screen and roomy keyboard  The Powerful One  Many laptops in this price range offer enough processing oomph for web browsing, Netflixing and Exceling, but not gamer-grade horsepower. Acer Inc.\u2019s Swift 3 does a little better. Its Core i7 processor, more powerful than you\u2019ll often find at this price, makes the machine more suitable for Photoshop users or inveterate tab-hoarders. Just don\u2019t expect it to run \u201cFortnite.\u201d  Acer also added a large selection of ports to the Swift 3 and a relatively large 14-inch display. But all that extra stuff makes it larger and heavier than my other picks. It works as a stashable in-home family PC, but by today\u2019s standards, it isn\u2019t especially mobile.  Lenovo | Yoga 720 $989 Battery Looks Power  Versatility  PROS  CONS  Shallow keyboard; subpar speakers  Light and flexible; often cheapest of the bunch  The Affordable One  Lenovo Group Ltd.\u2019s Yoga 720 has almost everything you\u2019d want in a laptop, and I\u2019ve seen it on sale for as little as $750. Its screen back flips to lie flat against the keyboard so you can hold it like a tablet. It\u2019s fast enough, lasts long enough and looks good enough.  My issues with the Yoga individually feel minor: The speakers sound mushy, the keyboard is a bit shallow, the design is bland. Together, they make clear why the 720 is cheaper than the others: It\u2019s a good computer for the price, but if you spend more on something else, you\u2019ll be glad.  HP | Spectre x360 $999 Battery Looks Power  Versatility  PROS  CONS  Gets dirty easily; uneven keyboard backlight  Clean, attractive look; excellent keyboard  The Best One  If all you want is to stop reading and just buy a new computer, here\u2019s your answer: The best $1,000 Windows computer is HP\u2019s latest Spectre x360, a machine that does everything well. We\u2019ve been recommending this line for a few years now, and HP just keeps improving it.  The x360 checks all the spec boxes, looks as good as anything out of Cupertino, Calif., and is enjoyable to use, from the speakers to the keyboard. It has a 360-degree hinge that flips the laptop into a tablet for drawing or using in a cramped space. It uses new USB-C ports for charging and data, but also offers an older-style standard USB-A port.  In my testing, the x360\u2019s biggest problem has been the lid\u2019s tendency to scuff in my bag. It came in third on my super-harsh battery test, behind the Surface Pro and nearly in line with the Dell: You should have no trouble using it through a workday. It\u2019s not rich with new ideas about what computers can be, but when you have work to do, that isn\u2019t the priority. You just want a laptop, and HP made a terrific one.

A malfunction in Google's devices could cause WiFi routers to become overwhelmed and temporarily shut down.  TP-Link has confirmed the issue, and WiFi routers from other companies are also reportedly affected.  Several of Google's hardware devices, including the popular Chromecast video streaming dongle and the new top-of-the-line smart speaker, appear to suffer from a glitch that can temporarily freeze a consumer's home wireless network.  Numerous owners of the devices have recently reported experiencing WiFi network issues, and several tech blogs say Google is to blame.  On Tuesday, a maker of networking products by the name of TP-Link wrote in a blog post that its routers have been affected by Google devices that use the Google \"casting\" feature. The company said a glitch caused a WiFi network to become temporarily unresponsive or disconnect from other devices that were connected to the network.  WiFi routers from other companies, including Linksys, Asus, Netgear, and Synology are also reportedly affected.  It's not clear whether the problem stems from a flaw in Google's hardware, or whether it's the result of a broader software issue.  But the news represents the latest blow to Google's efforts to enter the hardware market, where it has limited experience and competes against longtime gadget makers like Samsung and Apple. In October, Google was forced to disable a button on the Home Mini smart speaker before the product even shipped due to a privacy problem.  Google \"casting\" devices come out of sleep mode and cause disruptions  According to TP-Link's blog post on the WiFi issue, the problems began in October 2017.  Google The company explained that under normal circumstances, Google's casting devices are designed to wake from a sleep state every so often to communicate with a WiFi router with small bits of data, called \"packets.\"  The problem is that some of Google's devices were malfunctioning and wouldn't rise out sleep mode for longer periods of time. When they did awake from their slumber, they flooded a WiFi router with huge amounts of data packets at a \"very high speed,\" which would overwhelm certain routers and cause the disruptions. The amount of data that would be sent to a WiFi router depended on how long a Google casting device was in sleep mode.  TP-Link has issued firmware updates for its affected WiFi routers, and a statement from Google to Engadget said \"We're aware that a small number of users are having issues and our team is working quickly to share a solution.\"  One of the ways to prevent WiFi network issues is to disable the casting feature in your Google casting devices. Of course, if the product is a Chromecast, that means you're effectively making the product useless.  Business Insider has contacted Google for comment, as well as a clarification of which devices can become affected, but the company hasn't yet replied.  There are several devices that support Google's casting feature, like smartphones, tablets, media streamers, and smart TVs. It's unclear if its specifically Google's own casting hardware causing the disruptions, or if it's Google's casting software feature found in several devices, too.", "stock": "GOOGL", "label": -1, "date": "2018-01-16", "source": "business-insider", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/google-casting-devices-causing-problems-home-wifi-networks-2018-1"}, {"article": "Photo  SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Google is joining Facebook in banning advertising for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

The new restriction would apply both to space on Google\u2019s platforms, like YouTube, and to third-party websites where Google sells advertising space.  Facebook announced in January that it would ban all ads for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in order to stop misleading and deceptive promotions.

The difficulty of dealing with inappropriate online content stands out with the Parkland shooting because the tech companies have effectively committed to removing any accusations that the Parkland survivors were actors, a step they did not take after other recent mass shootings, such as last October\u2019s massacre in Las Vegas. In the past, the companies typically addressed specific types of content only when it was illegal \u2014 posts from terrorist organizations, for example \u2014 Mr. Morgan said.  Facebook and YouTube\u2019s promises follow a stream of criticism in recent months over how their sites can be gamed to spread Russian propaganda, among other abuses. The companies have said they are betting big on artificial intelligence systems to help identify and take down inappropriate content, though that technology is still being developed.  The companies have in the meantime hired or said they plan to hire more people to comb through what is posted to their sites. Facebook said it was hiring 1,000 new moderators to review content and was making changes to what type of news publishers would be favored on the social network. YouTube has said that it plans to have 10,000 moderators by year\u2019s end and that it is altering its search algorithms to return more videos from reliable news sources.  Mary deBree, head of content policy at Facebook, said the company had not been perfect at staving off certain content and most likely would not be in the future.  \u201cFalse information is like any other challenge where humans are involved: It evolves, much like a rumor or urban legend would.

The sites have automated detection systems that often search for specific terms or images that have previously been deemed unacceptable. So to evade those systems, people sometimes can alter images or switch to different terminology.  Sam Woolley, an internet researcher at the nonprofit Institute for the Future, said far-right groups had started using internet brands to describe minorities \u2014 like \u201cSkype\u201d to indicate Jewish people \u2014 to trick software and human reviewers.  Those who post conspiracy theories also tend to quickly repost or engage with similar posts from other accounts, creating a sort of viral effect that can cause the sites\u2019 algorithms to promote the content as a trending topic or a recommended video, said David Carroll, a professor at the New School who studies tech platforms.  That duplication and repackaging of misinformation \u201cmake the game of snuffing it out Whac-a-Mole to the extreme,\u201d he said.  That game played out across the web in the past few days, after a video suggesting that one of the most vocal Parkland survivors, David Hogg, was an actor became the No. 1 trending video on YouTube. After a public outcry, YouTube removed the video and said it would take down other \u201ccrisis actor\u201d videos because they violated its ban on bullying.

A video posted last week by Alex Jones, the founder of the conspiracy theory site Infowars, titled \u201cRed Alert!

They do\u2014more than ever. The problem is that the money generated by news audiences flows mostly to Google and Facebook , not to the reporters and publishers who produce excellent journalism.  The Duopoly now captures 83% of all digital ad revenue growth and 73% of U.S. digital advertising, according to a CNBC report. As a result, newspapers\u2019 online audience growth does not produce revenue to match. According to data from Pew, newspaper advertising revenue fell from $22 billion in 2014 to $18 billion in 2016 even as web traffic for the top 50 U.S. newspapers increased 42%.

Photo: Elise Amendola/Associated Press  Google and Facebook have become the primary and de facto regulators of the news business, and governments around the world are starting to recognize the danger. British Prime Minister Theresa May announced earlier this month that her government would review the economics of internet news consumption. Regulators in Germany, Israel and South Korea are investigating how Google\u2019s business practices have disrupted the media market and harmed publishers and consumers. U.S. regulators, on the other hand, have rarely looked into Google or Facebook\u2014and never at their influence in the news marketplace.  Some voices on the left and right are calling for Google and Facebook to be regulated as utilities. But there is an easier solution: exempt news publishers from certain aspects of antitrust regulation.  U.S. antitrust laws, designed to promote fair competition and prevent consolidation, actually make it harder for traditional news outlets to compete with Silicon Valley giants. Under current law, for instance, news publishers cannot get together and agree to withhold their product unless they receive a return on their investment. Let\u2019s start by changing that simple inequity. News publishers should be able to use their collective leverage in negotiations with big tech.  Rep. David Cicilline, top Democrat on the House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee, is expected to introduce a bill to do that next week. The Journalism Competition and Preservation Act of 2018 is a low-regulation, pro-market way to unleash the news industry\u2019s negotiating power. If antitrust enforcers can\u2019t protect society from the outsize influence of modern-day trusts, the least the government can do is get out of the way and let publishers protect themselves and their readers.

Since its founding in 2013, CoreOS raised $48 million in venture capital \u2014 likely making this a solid exit for its high-profile bunch of Silicon Valley investors, including Kleiner Perkins, Intel Capital, Y Combinator, and GV (formerly Google Ventures).  Indeed, CoreOS has a history with Google: In 2015, at the same time as it announced the investment from GV, CoreOS made a big bet on supporting Kubernetes, a Google-created developer technology. Since then, Kubernetes has become a predominant standard in the market for software containers, raising the profile of CoreOS.  \"We made the right bets along the way,\" CoreOS CEO Alex Polvi told Business Insider on Tuesday.  Polvi points out that CoreOS and Red Hat have long had a business relationship, and says the acquisition will let them keep doing what they've been doing \"in a bigger and better way.\"  This is actually the second time Polvi has led a company to an acquisition. In 2010, he sold his company Cloudkick to Rackspace for a reported $30 million, after raising a relatively modest $2.75 million.  CoreOS was one of the first and most visible companies in the container space, seen for a long time as the chief rival to $1.3 billion startup Docker, which basically invented the market. Indeed, in 2014, the two of them had a public falling out over the future of containers.  Think of these \"containers\" as a metaphor. Shipping yards put goods into a bunch of shipping containers all the same shape and size because it makes them easy to stack onto boats. Software containers are a standard way to package up software, so it all runs the same way whether it's running on your laptop, a corporate server, or in a massive cloud like Amazon Web Services.  Red Hat president Jim Whitehurst Red Hat  In this metaphor, Kubernetes is the gantry crane that lifts and loads these containers: It helps IT departments and developer teams keep all their containers moving smoothly across their infrastructure. As containers grow in popularity, so too has Kubernetes as a way to manage them.  This is the root of Red Hat's interest in CoreOS. CoreOS originally rose to prominence as the developers of a custom, lightweight version of the Linux operating system designed for smart gadgetry like DVD players.  However, it turned out that the CoreOS software was ideal for lightweight software containers, too, ultimately leading it towards Kubernetes. Now, in addition to the CoreOS software, Red Hat offers Tectonic, a Kubernetes-based container management system of its own.  Red Hat supports Kubernetes in its own server-side software products, and offers its own Kubernetes-based container management tools. It turns out that CoreOS, in developing its own container offerings, made it super-easy to keep a Kubernetes system up to date with the latest security patches and other updates \u2014 bolstering Red Hat's play.  \"A lot of their operations have been around making things easier,\" Matt Hicks, a senior VP of engineering at Red Hat, told Business Insider on Tuesday. He says CoreOS technology is \"kind of complementary in terms of how we work together.\"  In particular, Red Hat is excited about how CoreOS and its Linux distribution make it easier to keep a bunch of Kubernetes-managed containers up-to-date in terms of security patches and new feature updates.  \"We think our largest customers will benefit from this,\" Red Hat VP and general manager Ashesh Badani told Business Insider.  According to Polvi, there's not going to be much change in the game-plan in the short-term. But in the long-term, expect to see deeper integrations between Red Hat's whole product suite and the CoreOS offering.  \"Over the coming months, we'll set the longer-term roadmap and figure it out,\" Polvi told us.", "stock": "GOOGL", "label": -1, "date": "2018-01-31", "source": "business-insider", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/red-hat-coreos-acquisition-explanation-2018-1"}, {"article": "Google cofounder Larry Page Getty  Google crossed a red line on Tuesday.  Actually, Google crossed the line sometime before Tuesday, but it was only with Gizmodo's report about Google's contract providing AI technology to the U.S. Department of Defense that the world learned about the situation.  For anyone who has followed Google for some time, the revelation of its contract with the Pentagon is stunning. That's because Google has long resisted playing any part in the military industrial complex.  It's not a policy that's explicitly written in any of Google's bylaws, but it's easy enough to recognize.  In the past 10 years of records available on USAspending.gov, there are roughly a dozen public contracts between Google and the Department of Defense.  These contracts are all inconsequential: $10,ooo for access to Google Earth here, or $6,000 for Google's search hardware there. It's less than pocket change for the deep-pocketed Google.  A company like Google would need to go out of its way to avoid working with the military  For a company at the leading edge of tech innovation, Google's lack of military contracts is pretty remarkable. Compare that to Microsoft, for instance, which has hundreds of contracts with the DoD during the past ten years, including a $78 million multi-year consulting deal with the Air Force.  A Boston Dynamics robot Boston Dynamics When Google acquired the robotics company Boston Dynamics in 2013, Google even went so far as to publicly say that, while it would honor any of Boston Dynamics' existing military contracts, Google would not pursue new work with the DoD and that it did not plan to become a military contractor.  Google has since sold Boston Dynamics, and Google is not building killer robots for the military. But the AI contract with the military is clearly a break from tradition \u2014 according to Gizmodo, the accidental revelation of the contract within Google set off a firestorm among some employees.  According to the report, the military is using Google's TensorFlow \u2014 open source technology that anyone can use to create applications that harness artificial intelligence \u2014 to help analyze video footage collected by drones.  The collaboration is part of a pilot project known as Project Maven, and most likely involves Google staffers helping the military figure out how to use TensorFlow and other AI technology. Google is not disclosing the financial terms of the contract.  This is not what most people think the words \"non-offensive\" means  Google is trying to downplay the revelation as business as usual. The company's official statement stresses that Google has always worked with \"government agencies,\" as if there were no difference between working with the Department of Education and the Department of Defense.  Google also insists that the contract is for \"non-offensive\" uses of its technology.  Still, it's not clear what exactly \"non-offensive\" really means. Sure, Google technology may not be part of a Skynet-like system that allows drones to automatically fire missiles when Google's AI detects an enemy target.  But Google is using a much narrower definition of \"non-offensive\" than what most people probably imagine.  Google's AI technology will allow drones to distinguish between a school with students carrying books and a bunker with gun-toting fighters. Yes, it will be up to military analysts to then decide whether or not to strike a target. But to describe Google's role in these scenarios as \"non-offensive\" stretches credulity.  Google is jeopardizing its biggest asset  This is a big reversal of what appears to have at the very least been an unofficial policy long espoused by the company that brought you Don't be Evil.  It's worth noting that former Google CEO and Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt was appointed to a Pentagon advisory board in March 2016 aimed at bringing Silicon Valley innovation to the military. In December 2017, Schmidt resigned his position as Executive Chairman of Alphabet (though he remains on the board and a technical advisor) so that he could \"dive into\" the latest science, technology and philanthropy.  Whatever the cause of the change, it's alarming because Google's biggest asset is consumer trust. Specifically, the trust that a company that has accumulated so much personal data about our lives (from our search history, to the places we go using Google Maps) and that has so much power, will remain loyal to the principles on which founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin built the company.  As Google, and its now-parent company Alphabet, expand into more areas of our lives (Waymo for cars, Verily for health), and as the company's founders get older, it's reasonable to wonder if it still represents the values it once did.  To be clear, there's nothing wrong with Google working with the military. Plenty of tech companies do it. It's every company's prerogative to make that decision. But Google made a choice many years ago to not dedicate its technology to warfare.  If it's going to change that, especially as Google becomes a major developer of sophisticated artificial technology, it owes the world and the employees working on that technology an honest explanation.", "stock": "GOOGL", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-06", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/google-working-with-united-states-department-of-defense-2018-3"}, {"article": "Flight delay predictions, mobile trip-planning, automatic itinerary management, language translation through Bluetooth earbuds, and a smartphone that enables users to learn about landmarks by tapping an icon and aiming the phone at them: These are among the travel innovations Google has been introducing in recent days and weeks.

Last year, the company struck deals with Fox Sports to stream the UEFA Champions League and with Univision to broadcast live games from Mexico\u2019s top soccer league. The company also had 20 non-exclusive MLB games last season and acquired exclusive rights to stream 47 college basketball games involving smaller conferences this year.  With 1.4 billion active daily users, the world\u2019s biggest social network is also still growing, in contrast with conventional TV networks that have been losing viewers and advertising.

The proposal, written by Ellen Weintraub, a Democrat and vice chair of the commission, would require online advertisements to carry the same disclaimers from their sponsors as do radio, television and print ads. The commission will consider the framework, known as a notice of proposed rule making, at its next public hearing on March 8.  The move comes as tech companies face growing scrutiny in Washington ranging from concerns about market dominance to concerns that online platforms are used for sex trafficking of children.  Congress has been examining how Russians used social media platforms to influence the 2016 election, and bipartisan bills have been introduced in both the House and Senate that would require companies like Facebook and Google to disclose information about sponsors of political ads on their sites, including how much they\u2019re spending and what audiences the ads are focusing on.    FEC Disclaimers  Though the FEC proposal, which was shared by Weintraub, would apply to campaigns, political parties and other organizations that try to influence federal elections, tech companies could also be affected. They might have to adapt their platforms to accommodate the kind of disclaimers the FEC envisions.  In 2011, Facebook asked the FEC for an exemption from disclaimer rules because its ads used a \"sponsored\" tag that did not identify the sponsor, and did not necessarily link back to the sponsor\u2019s website. The election commission deadlocked on granting an exemption.  In the wake of revelations that Facebook, Google and other online sites were used by Russians in 2015 and 2016 to influence Americans on hot button social and political issues, the FEC reopened the rule making process to require more disclosure for online ads. The draft rule would require text and graphic ads to include the name of a sponsor \"in letters of sufficient size to be clearly readable.\"  Political ads on streaming music services or Internet radio stations would have to include oral disclaimers, while candidates buying online video and audio ads would have to state their names and add, \"And I approve of this message.\"  Paid Advertisements  The notice also seeks input on whether political organizations that use free services -- like uploading videos to YouTube -- should be required to say they are responsible for the ads. Under current law, disclaimers are only required on paid advertisements.  The notice, which will require the support of Republican commissioners to be adopted, also tries to anticipate how developing technologies, including virtual and augmented reality, should be regulated.  The last time the FEC issued a ruling on internet advertising was in 2006, the year after YouTube was founded. That ruling required individuals and committees buying online political ads to disclose how much they spent on the ads. It also called for a disclaimer for all \"paid Internet advertising placed on another person\u2019s website,\" such as banner ads. The requirement exempted other forms of Internet communications, such as blog posts.  The six-member commission, which enforces election laws, can include no more than three members from one party.

Facebook doesn't have much incentive to listen.  The company is already reticent about being seen as a media company and is moving away from the news business.  Media companies don't have a ton of leverage over Facebook or Google.  Plus the technological challenges involved in either getting paid or choking off Facebook are significant.  The newsrooms at the 'old media' Wall Street Journal and 'digital native' BuzzFeed may not see eye-to-eye on much, but suddenly their bosses have lots to bond over.  That's because, in one way or another, both News Corp. chairman Rupert Murdoch and BuzzFeed CEO Jonah Peretti believe that Facebook and Google aren't giving news organizations a fair deal. They want them to pay up for news stories shared on the platforms.  In each case, however, it's not clear whether any single news organization has serious leverage against the duopoly, or, as Business Insider's Nathan McAlone noted, the technical wherewithal to actually pull or block all of their content from either platform.  Still, it's not crazy to think that Facebook, in particular, could and probably should pay publishers to distribute their content. But who says they care enough or see what's in it for them?  Why should Facebook listen to Rupert Murdoch?  Murdoch doesn't make any explicit threats in his fiery note. It's easy to see why. What threat could he make? Could he pull down the New York Post's Facebook page tomorrow? Would people notice or care? This isn't like MTV going dark on a cable system in the 1990s, which would inevitably lead to fans calling their cable switchboard to complain.  More importantly, Murdoch couldn't stop people from posting New York Post articles to Facebook, could it? I asked Gabriele Boland, manager of content strategy at the social media analytics firm News Whip, and she said she's not sure how they would.Making links 'not shareable' is one potential way but that seems counterproductive. Publishers want people passing around their stories. One way to go would be for the New York Post to charge for everything,  \"A news site could extremely limit its own Facebook traffic by \"pay-walling\" their content,\" Boland said, noting that even a fully pay-walled property like the Financial Times still racks up tons of engagement on Facebook.  Ok, what about the idea that Facebook needs good content, that it's part of the reason people like hanging out there?  \"The publishers are obviously enhancing the value and integrity of Facebook through their news and content but are not being adequately rewarded for those services,\" Murdoch wrote on Monday.  Maybe this is true. But if anything, the tech giant seems to want to make news go away on Facebook, rather the get further into bed with it.  Murdoch has talked tough about this before  Back in 2009, Murdoch talked about blocking all of his company's news stories from Google search entirely. He had support in the \"Google is bad for news\" camp. Around that time, noted mogul Mark Cuban (\"Shark Tank\") called Google a \"vampire.\"  There was even industry chatter - believe it or not - that a bunch of news organizations could ban together and pull their content from Google searches in favor or Microsoft's Bing.  But alas, nobody went through with it, as it was likely way too scary to give up the traffic Google searches deliver.  The same kind of fears would be top of mind for anyone mulling a full Facebook boycott.  Here's the case for paying publishers, besides being a nice thing for the world  If you think about it, an exclusive programmed, strategy is exactly what Facebook is trying to do with Facebook Watch, where only partner companies can upload video and some are being paid by Facebook to do so. Thus it's not outside the realm of possibility that Facebook could do the same for news.  This kind of members-only approach could keep Facebook out of trouble. It would be an abrupt change, but what if you could only find content on Facebook from an approved set of limited, vetted partners?  This could be seen as a vital, pro-journalism, pro-democracy gesture by Facebook (which, you may recall, has recently had some unwanted meetings with Congress over its anti-democracy impact). And it could keep the company out of more fake news trouble in 2020.  Plus, Murdoch's right. It really wouldn't cost that much. \"Carriage payments would have a minor impact on Facebook's profits,\" he wrote. For a company that pulls in $10 billion-plus in revenue a quarter, a few checks to some newspapers is pocket change for Zuckerberg.  The case against paying is that it makes Facebook a media company  Facebook is by nature open. It's that Silicon Valley utopian ideal that makes Facebook Facebook. Do they really want to change that? \"At our heart we're a tech company,\" COO Sheryl Sandberg told Axios last October.  After all, people like what they like, whether its fake news or mean stories about Trump. Who is Facebook to say they can't share conspiracy theories or the like?  Allison Shelley/Getty Images  Plus, does Facebook want to manage another few hundred publisher relationships on top of what it's doing with Watch? At least with Watch, the promise is hitting Google's YouTube where it hurts and ultimately stealing some TV ad budgets. Watch is a relatively small project (Facebook is spending about $1 billion on it).  Becoming the Internet's curated newsstand (Facebook Read anyone?) is a whole other level. It makes Facebook a media distributor much like Comcast. Which is exactly where it doesn't want to be.  Lastly, paying a select group of publishers probably won't do much for Facebook's bottom line. And that's usually the bottom line.", "stock": "FB", "label": 1, "date": "2018-01-22", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/rupert-murdoch-may-be-right-about-facebook-paying-media-companies-2018-1"}, {"article": "Separately, White House officials left the details of the president\u2019s $1.5 trillion infrastructure plan to Congress.

Photo  Back Story  On this day in 1887, Harvey Wilcox, a real estate developer from Kansas, filed a plan with Los Angeles County for a small, gridded subdivision that he called Hollywood. (The origin of the name is a subject of dispute.)  Over the next decade, Mr. Wilcox and his wife, Daeida, conjured out of the desert a strict Christian community of orchards and Victorian cottages, connected to Los Angeles by a lone streetcar line.  Photo  There were just a few hundred residents, and the hamlet banned alcohol, bowling alleys and even, briefly, movie theaters. But in 1910, Hollywood voted to merge with Los Angeles.  Soon, movie studios fled the enforcement of Thomas Edison\u2019s monopoly on film patents and started setting up in the ideal Southern California light.  In 1923, the Hollywoodland sign went up (it was truncated to Hollywood in 1949). The original sign was an illuminated billboard for a segregated housing development that called itself a fortress against \u201cmetropolitanism\u201d; one ad urged, \u201cProtect your family.\u201d  The sign was left up as the so-called Golden Age of Hollywood arrived, a noirish era embodied by the starlet Peg Entwistle, who jumped to her death from the H in 1932.

Wang-Li Moser resigned late last year, people with knowledge of the situation said Friday. Ms. Moser wanted to return to the U.S. for personal reasons, one of these people said.  Ms. Moser couldn\u2019t be reached for comment. Her exit was first reported by the New York Times.  Analysts say the loss of Ms. Moser only adds to Facebook\u2019s challenges in re-entering China, where it has been blocked since 2009, reflecting the government\u2019s concern over the ability of large social networks to stir unrest.

Last week, in a move widely seen as a possible back door into China for the Silicon Valley company, Facebook joined with Beijing-based smartphone company Xiaomi Corp. to launch a new virtual-reality headset called Mi VR Standalone, modeled after Facebook\u2019s Oculus Go.  Ms. Moser, a U.S. citizen born in China, was hired to help build face-to-face relations with government officials. Before joining Facebook, Ms. Moser spent more than a decade at Intel Corp. in China, where former colleagues said she helped Intel build a $2.5 billion factory.  In a 2011 essay, she called arranging meetings with Chinese officials a \u201clong, trivial and pressing\u201d task. She had some successes at Facebook, joining Mr. Zuckerberg for a meeting with Lu Wei, then China\u2019s top internet regulator, at Facebook headquarters in late 2014.  She also accompanied Mr. Zuckerberg in March 2016 to Beijing meetings with Mr. Lu and the Communist Party\u2019s ideology chief Liu Yunshan.  William Shuai, a former government official who Ms. Moser hired away from LinkedIn Corp.\u2019s China operations in September, has assumed her duties for now, according to one person familiar with the situation. LinkedIn is the only major U.S. social network to have a foothold in China, after it agreed to submit to government censorship to gain access to the market.

Facebook has struggled to respond to mounting ire from users, politicians, customers and others over its role in facilitating the spread of misinformation and divisive content. Photo: Paul Sakuma/Associated Press  Facebook Inc. FB 0.40% is contending with a new wave of criticism prompted by the U.S. indictment alleging that Russia manipulated social-media platforms\u2014and by a Facebook executive\u2019s attempts to address the issue.  The indictment against Russian companies and individuals described how an organization called the Internet Research Agency allegedly used Facebook, Twitter Inc., TWTR -0.83% and the YouTube arm of Alphabet Inc.\u2019s GOOGL -0.12% Google to sow discord in the U.S. starting in 2014. The document\u2019s description of events showed that Facebook and its Instagram photo-sharing unit were particularly central to the alleged Russian attempts to influence U.S. public opinion.  Researchers who study social media said the indictment, secured by special counsel Robert Mueller, showed that Facebook was ill-prepared for such efforts. Facebook has more than 25,000 employees, but fewer than 100 Russian provocateurs armed with social-media savvy and widely available technological tools were able to manipulate its platform for years, the indictment says.  Comments by Facebook\u2019s head of advertising, Rob Goldman, after the indictment was handed up Friday fueled further criticism. Mr. Goldman, writing on Twitter, said there are \u201ceasy ways to fight\u201d the Russian campaign, starting with having a \u201cwell educated citizenry.\u201d He also tweeted that the Russians\u2019 main goal wasn\u2019t to sway the 2016 election, but more broadly to sow division in the U.S.  Mr. Goldman\u2019s series of eight tweets provoked more than 9,000 responses on Twitter, many of them angry.  \u201cYou really are not in a position to preach and your astonishing tweets have created confusion and anger,\u201d Mainardo de Nardis, a senior executive at advertising giant Omnicom Group Inc., said in a tweet Sunday. \u201cEnough damage done over the past 2+ years. In the absence of real actions silence would be appreciated.\u201d Mr. de Nardis didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.  A Facebook spokesman said Mr. Goldman, who didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment, had sent his tweets in a personal capacity. The company pointed to a statement from Joel Kaplan, Facebook\u2019s vice president of global public policy, saying, \u201cNothing we found contradicts the Special Counsel\u2019s indictments.\u201d  Russia\u2019s government has repeatedly denied any government effort to influence the U.S. election.  Facebook has struggled for much of the past year to respond to mounting ire from users, politicians, customers and others over its role in facilitating the spread of misinformation and divisive content.  The indictment shows that \u201cthere are lots of levers that get pulled in social media for the sake of manipulation and a lot of those levers aren\u2019t even known by the companies themselves,\u201d said Sam Woolley, an Oxford University research associate who has studied propaganda efforts on social-media platforms.  The indictment documented an unprecedented manipulation campaign targeting Facebook, its Instagram platform, Twitter and YouTube. Starting in 2014, the Russians built an influence operation that drew followers to bogus accounts that spread disinformation, organized U.S. demonstrations and even paid a person to dress up like Hillary Clinton in a prison uniform at a West Palm Beach, Fla., rally, the indictment says.  While much of the attention around the Russian manipulation focused on its efforts to stoke divisions ahead the 2016 U.S. presidential election, it is clear the campaign continued since then. The Wall Street Journal reported in October that some of the Russian-backed social-media accounts posted divisive messages at least as recently as last August.  The Twitter comments of Mr. Goldman, Facebook\u2019s head of advertising, also fueled disagreement about the intent of the Russian efforts. One of Mr. Goldman\u2019s tweets said \u201cswaying the election was *NOT* the main goal\u201d of the Russian ads, and that \u201cthe majority of the Russian ad spend happened AFTER the election.\u201d  On Saturday, President Donald Trump cited Mr. Goldman\u2019s comment in support of the idea that Russia\u2019s actions didn\u2019t affect the election.  Following criticism that he was obscuring the intent of the Russians, Mr. Goldman later tweeted that \u201cthe Russian campaign was certainly in favor of Mr. Trump.\u201d He also dialed back some of his claims. \u201cI am only speaking here about the Russian behavior on Facebook. That is the only aspect that I observed directly,\u201d he tweeted.  Clint Watts, a fellow with the Foreign Policy Research Institute who studied the Russian influence campaign, said the ads bought on Facebook were only \u201ca much smaller part of a very large effort.\u201d  \u201cMr. Goldman should have stayed silent,\u201d Mr. Watts said, adding that playing down the effect of the influence campaign risked further angering Americans. \u201cThe public is upset that they got duped on Facebook\u2019s platform. Facebook got duped,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes it seem like they don\u2019t get it.\u201d  While Facebook\u2019s role in the Russian campaign is in the spotlight, some researchers who have studied the efforts note that it was far from the only institution to fall short.  \u201cLet\u2019s not mince words. The Obama administration did not react quickly enough to this problem. The intelligence community did not react quickly enough to this problem,\u201d said Thomas Rid, professor of strategic studies at Johns Hopkins University.  Facebook has said it is taking a number of steps to prevent efforts like the Russian campaign from happening again, including hiring 10,000 employees tasked with policing hate speech, as well as coming up with ways to uproot fake accounts. Facebook officials also have emphasized that the company provided information to Mr. Mueller.  Based on the information that's now coming out of congressional committees, Russian goals to interfere in the 2016 election were very broad. WSJ's Gerald F. Seib explains just how sophisticated the Russian efforts were using social media. Photo: AP (Originally published Nov. 2, 2017)  Mr. Goldman, too, said Facebook is taking \u201caggressive steps to prevent this sort of meddling in the future,\u201d including verification for all political advertisers. Still, his comments struck some observers as tone deaf.  \u201cIt was an almost perfect example of Silicon Valley overconfidence and lack of sophistication when it comes to politics,\u201d said Josh Hendler, former director of technology for the Democratic National Committee, which suffered a cyberattack ahead of the 2016 election that U.S. officials blamed on Russia.

I love Facebook and don't want to delete it. When I signed up, I made a deal with Facebook and I was OK with it: I get to use it for free and in exchange I willingly share some info about me to let Facebook serve me relevant ads. Sure, Facebook, go ahead and send me all the ads you want about things I want to buy: bicycles, skiing, fitness, fashion, travel, pets, movies, books and so on. It sounded great.  But as Facebook's data privacy scandal has embroiled the company, I've grown increasing disgusted.  Back in 2014, Facebook began watching people as we wander across the internet. At that time, it instituted privacy controls that seemed to put me in control, to tell Facebook which people can see my posts, friends or the public.  But that's only half of the story.  Zuckerberg also repeatedly told Congress that Facebook doesn't share my info directly with advertisers, nor does it sell my data. It uses data on me to decide which ads to show to which people.  But it's harder to tell Facebook which data on me to use for its ads. And Facebook is still tracking more information about me for this purpose than I want. For instance, the Facebook Audience Network is used by mobile apps serves ads in a mobile apps and analyzes what people do with a mobile app.  Ad blocker AdGuard recently analyzed 2,556 popular apps and found 41% of them use Facebook Audience Network. That means, even if you don't use Facebook, these apps could be sharing data about you with Facebook.  By the way, Google does this on an even bigger scale. 65% of the apps that AdGuard analyzes used one of Google's tracking services.  On top of that, if I visit a website that is using the Facebook Pixel, Facebook knows I've been to that website and can show me an ad for the company in my newsfeed. That's creepy and annoying. Pixel is a popular tool used by website owners to track and analyze what you do on their websites.  Now, Zuckerberg insisted many times in his congressional testimony that I can control the ads I see.  It's not easy to do that, but through its Ad Preferences page, I can opt out of seeing ads based on how Facebook is monitoring my internet use by clicking on \"no\" \"no\" and \"no one\" in the settings.  Facebook/Business Insider  I also adjusted what Facebook thinks it knows about me. This requires sifting through the list of stuff it tracks on me, one by one, and deleting.  I started with the \"Your categories\" setting.  Facebook/Business Insider  Next up, I went through the \"Your interests\" settings: what Facebook thinks it knows about me in terms of business, hobbies, sports, travel, etc.. I had to delete them one-by-one, including the ones listed in \"more.\"  Facebook/Business Insider  I started to do the same for the section marked \"Advertisers you've interacted with.\" But after 15 minutes, with no way to know how close I was to the end, I gave up for now. I will come back to it and delete more each day.  This was perhaps the most shocking section, as it involves lists shared with Facebook where my name appears, even though I have no idea who some of these companies are, or how they wound up identified with my Facebook profile. It was also filled with politicians (like Doug Robinson, below), most of whom I didn't know.  Facebook/Business Insider  But because Facebook is ad-supported, it warns that I will still see ads.  Again, I'm A-OK with that, especially ads on topics of interest to me. But I don't get to choose. The advertiser, who is paying the bill, gets to choose.  Facebook says that, even if I limit my interests, it will still show me ads based on the following:  \"Your age, gender or location.  The content in the app or website you're using.  Your activity off of the Facebook Companies.\"  That last bit, \"Facebook Companies\" is particularly worrisome.  In addition to the Facebook Pixel and Facebook Audience Network, Facebook owns a company, Atlas that puts a bit of code on your browser to watch what you do on the internet. Facebook also owns \"Moves,\" a fitness tracking app that monitors your location, if you use that app. And it owns Onovo, a security app that was the subject of another privacy scandal for its policy of sharing data with Facebook.  In other words, while you can control the ads you see, you can't really control the information that Facebook gathers on you.  So, if the nation wants more control over how our lives are being watched, we'll need to push, and probably regulate, Facebook and the whole internet ad industry.  In the meantime, for people like me, that don't want to quit Facebook, we can limit the ads Facebook shows us through its internet spying practices, limiting the financial reward it gets for such creepy behavior.  If you are an ad industry employee with information about surprising or unethical ways internet companies gather and use data, we want to hear it. jbort@businessinsider.com or DM me @Julie188 on Twitter.", "stock": "FB", "label": -1, "date": "2018-04-11", "source": "business-insider", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-control-your-data-on-facebook-like-mark-zuckerberg-says-you-can-2018-4"}, {"article": "Markets Insider  Tesla beat Wall Street's earnings expectations on Wednesday, but the stock is falling near its lowest levels of 2018.  You can follow Tesla stock in real-time on Markets Insider>>    Shares of Tesla are down more than 8% in trading Thursday, nearing their lowest point of 2018 so far.  The company on Wednesday posted a smaller-than-expected fourth quarter loss as well as a slower cash burn, but it wasn\u2019t enough to keep the stock in the green.  The electric car maker said it lost an adjusted $3.04 per share, on revenues of $3.29 billion \u2014 analysts had expected a loss of $3.16 per share on revenues of $3.28 billion. Tesla also reaffirmed its forecast for Model 3 production through the second quarter.  Tesla has historically missed key production deadlines, delivering just half of the cars analysts expected last month, yet its stock price generally continues to climb.  In January, CNBC reported that production of the company's Model 3 sedan could be even further delayed thanks to an ongoing battery assembly issue. Tesla denied the reports.  \"2018 will be a transformative year for Tesla, with a high level of operational scaling,\" CEO Elon Musk said in a press release. \"As we ramp production of both Model 3 and our energy products while keeping tight control of operating expenses, our quarterly operating income should turn sustainably positive at some point in 2018.\"  Wall Street remains mixed on the company\u2019s ability to deliver. Analysts polled by Bloomberg \u2014 only a third of whom have a buy rating for the stock \u2014 give Tesla an average target price of $319, or 5% below where shares were trading Thursday morning.  Oppenheimer, one of Tesla\u2019s more optimistic research shops, says the company continues to \u201cwade through the weeds\u201d while production delays remain.  \u201cAutomation fixes being done in Germany suggest that Model 3 production targets are at risk and that investors will not be surprised by such delays, which we expect will allow TSLA to push out capex payments, reducing near-term cash pressure,\u201d analyst Colin Rusch said in a note to clients.  \u201cWe expect investors will remain split on results and that shares will trade sideways as bulls remain patient on Model 3 production.\u201d  This bullishness is reflected in a measure called short interest, which indicates bets that a stock will drop. The $29.2 million currently being held short is the least in three months, and 11% lower than a seven-month high reached in December.

Justin Sullivan/Getty Images  The idea that Apple should buy Tesla has been floated many times.  Apple now has more than enough cash coming back to the US to do the deal.  Tesla needs to be saved from its delusional idea about the company's future growth \u2014 and Apple needs to be saved from the disaster of its car project.  Last November, Rolling Stone published a profile of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, written by Neil Strauss, a neo-gonzo journalist who made his name with a book about pickup culture. And in that interview Musk made a confession.  \"I wish we could be private with Tesla,\" Musk told Strauss. \"It actually makes us less efficient to be a public company.\"  Tesla has been public since its 2010 IPO and since then the stock has risen from about $20 a share to nearly $400 at one point in 2017. The company's market cap is now close to $60 billion. Investors who jumped in seven years ago have enjoyed a return of nearly 1,200%.  Musk might be the only person who wishes Tesla were private. Even short-sellers, recently clobbered by Tesla's surge, have been delighted when the stock has gone through one of its periodic swoons of $100 in a few months. And ironically, Musk's next ten years of compensation are now completely tied to Tesla's market performance, which the board of directors thinks can yield a $650-billion market cap.  That's delusional. In many ways, it sets Musk up for both continued inefficiency \u2014 a lot of second-guessing about investments in automation, for example, at the expense of hitting production targets \u2014 and potentially epic failure. It also represents a radical formulation of shareholder value theory.  Tesla is wildly overvalued, and what it needs now isn't a fatter stock price but rather an ability to satisfy customers. For the Model 3 mass-market vehicle, currently stalled amid production bottlenecks, Tesla has 400,000 mostly unfulfilled pre-orders.  Apple buying Tesla is an idea that always seems to be on the table  Apple CEO Tim Cook. Getty  In the past, there's been talk about somebody buying Tesla. Usually, Apple is the one that gets everybody's heart racing. I've shot down this idea several times. But with the announcement of Musk's new pay package, I think Tesla needs to be rescued from itself. And that Musk should get his wish.  Tesla is worth so much that there aren't very many companies able to buy the automaker. And Tesla going truly private would be too much of a reversal of history as well as a financial improbability, although if the bottom falls out some investors might someday snap up what's left of Tesla on the cheap.  Apple, thanks to the new tax bill, will repatriate over $250 billion is cash that it has been keeping overseas. Even after paying taxes on it, at the reduced corporate rate, it will have arguably too much left over. It could easily wind up going into share buybacks or a dividend, or Apple could continue its pattern of making small acquisitions.  Or the company, which is sitting on a mature iPhone business that mints the profits but could be looking at more severe growth headwinds in coming years, could swing for the fences and get a piece of the multi-trillion global transportation industry. If Tim Cook agrees with the Tesla board that the company will be worth $650 billion in a decade, then buying Tesla now would be a staggering bargain.  The obvious question is, \"Who would be Tesla's CEO?\" Musk's pay package is designed to ensure that it's him, an extreme evolution of addressing the \"great man\" risk that companies led by visionary founders face. But Musk is also running SpaceX and he's on the verge of launching a huge rocket that could pave the way for a Mars mission. Dealing with Tesla's difficulties could be seen as a needless distraction.  That said, Musk could remain CEO of Tesla as an independent business unit of Apple, while Tim Cook would run the entire show (Musk could also relinquish the CEO title but continue as chairman of the board). In a way, Cook isn't really a CEO in the Musk/Steve Jobs vein anyway. He's more like a mega-COO.  And that's just what Tesla actually needs right now. If it was Jobs who rescued Apple and put it on the path that led to the iPod and the iPhone, it was Cook who turned the company into the profit-making colossus it has become. The guy is a supply-chain genius. Making stuff is his bag. And at the moment, Tesla is struggling mightily to make stuff, falling well behind its ambitious production targets for the Model 3 mass-market vehicle.  Tesla would also witness its cash-burn challenges \u2014 over $1 billion per quarter \u2014 vanish. Apple could fund losses for years.  Tesla could help Apple get into the car business The Apple Car project isn't going well. Apple  Apple has a history of falling into innovations troughs. It's in one now, following the monumental success of the iPhone. The Apple Watch hasn't been a gamechanger, and the company is chasing Amazon on smart speakers. Apple clearly wants to do something in the transportation space, but thus far its efforts have been at best confused and at worst pathetic.  Buying Tesla would change that overnight. The Apple Car, really, is a Tesla car anyway. The whole philosophy behind Tesla's vehicles, and especially the ultra-minimalist Model 3, is Apple-esque. The wait for the Apple Car would be immediately over.  And that would enable Apple to focus on bringing to Tesla what Apple's engineers and designers are now probably working on: an entirely new vehicle interface \u2014 an operating system for the car of the future.  Tesla has aspects of such a system in place, from over-the-air software updates to an increasing focus on single screens for all vehicle operations. Apple would enhance and unify these components and transform them into something unexpected. This is Apple's mojo: take something that works and make it much, much better.  Missing out on a mega-return \u2014 but one that isn't likely  Tesla market cap has become epic. Andy Kiersz/Business Insider  For investors, of course, Apple buying Tesla would eliminate any chance of a mega-return. But I think the odds are low that the 1,000%-plus payback of the past seven years will be matched by another 1,000% surge over the next ten years (Tesla is, after all, 14 years old \u2014 hardly a startup). If Tesla stays public, stockholders will also have to put up with numerous, diluting capital raises and the ever-present threat that Tesla's lack of cash and debt burden will lead to a bankruptcy.  If Apple bought Tesla, the carmaker's growth would be piped into Apple shares, and Tesla investors would certainly get a premium for their holdings, as Apple can afford to overpay. I don't even think that government regulators would have issues with the merger. Sure, Apple would be buying the dominant electric-car manufacturer. But as of 2018, the EV market makes up only 1% of global sales.  I would have stuck to my guns on the foolishness of an Apple acquisition of Tesla were it not for the reckless pay package that Tesla concocted for Musk. But I now think that Tesla is fueling a dangerous idea about the company's capabilities. Somebody needs to save Tesla from its hubris. That somebody is Apple.", "stock": "TSLA", "label": 1, "date": "2018-01-27", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/why-apple-should-buy-tesla-2018-1"}, {"article": "Although valued similarly, there are vast differences between the companies. Ford sold 6.6 million vehicles last year, some 64 times Tesla\u2019s sales of 103,000. Ford earned $7.6 billion, which the market found disappointing. Tesla lost $2.24 billion on sales of $3.3 billion, which the market shrugged off, at least until recently. That tells you how the stock market values the future of both companies and of E.V.s in particular.  It\u2019s not a belief that\u2019s universally held. For at least a year, there has been open warfare between the Tesla believers and the Tesla skeptics and short sellers. The believers see the advance orders for the Model 3 as testimony to the company\u2019s disruptive brilliance. The Tesla shorts \u2014 investors who bet against the stock \u2014 see the company as an automotive Ponzi scheme. To them, the founder and chief executive, Elon Musk, is beginning to look more like Tesla\u2019s corporate eponym, Nikola Tesla, the brilliant but eccentric scientist who in 1888 created the alternating current electrical grid that powers the world today and who died penniless.  Yet you want to believe that Mr. Musk can pull this off. He rescued Tesla once before, when the company was days away from running out of cash. And in SpaceX, Mr. Musk has proved that he can run a highly sophisticated private spacecraft company.  Tesla\u2019s problem, unfortunately, isn\u2019t rocket science. In some ways it\u2019s more complex.  Tesla can\u2019t seem to run an auto production line, something that the Detroit auto companies that Mr. Musk mocks are very good at. Ford\u2019s electric vehicles and hybrids, such as the Fusion Energi, may not match the Tesla Model X in style or speed, but Ford can knock out millions of fenders and hoods in its stamping operations with absolute certainty and to tight specifications.  Tesla is operating out of the former G.M./Toyota joint venture plant in Fremont, Calif., which produced more than 400,000 cars annually at its peak. Tesla has been running at a quarter of that rate, and has had to resort to pulling cars off the line and finishing them by hand.

In recent days, though, Mr. Trump has targeted Amazon in tweets, asserting that the company has an unfair advantage. It\u2019s not clear what he could do to hurt Amazon\u2019s business, but the company\u2019s stock has plunged. Amazon\u2019s shares may well bounce back, but the criticism has added to investors\u2019 concerns about the outlook for large technology companies, whose soaring stock prices spearheaded the rally that took to the S.&P. 500 to its all-time high in January.  Too much blame can be placed on the White House, however.  Before investors began fretting about tech and trade, the underpinnings of the stock market\u2019s ascent were perhaps not as robust as they looked. Wall Street analysts expect earnings for the companies in the S.&P. 500 to increase 25 percent this year, according to data compiled by Standard & Poor\u2019s, an unusually large jump that was reflected in the stock market valuations. Much of that projected earnings increase is coming from tax cuts and some from expectations that companies\u2019 revenue would grow at a nice clip as global growth stayed strong.  The tax cuts are certainly going to improve profits. But rising interest rates around the world could weigh somewhat on companies\u2019 revenue growth. And if wages and other costs come in higher than expected \u2014 a significant possibility when the economy is suffering a shortage of some workers \u2014 profit margins could get squeezed. \u201cI don\u2019t think either of those are in the numbers,\u201d said Jim Paulsen, chief market strategist at the Leuthold Group.  \u2014 Peter Eavis  Photo  Not Funny  A little humor has not cleared the clouds over Tesla.  Shares in the company were once again sliding on Monday after the company\u2019s C.E.O., Elon Musk, joked on April 1 that Tesla had gone bankrupt, an apparent attempt to make light of concerns that the electric car maker is straining under its debt load.  Tesla\u2019s stock is now down 35 percent from its high of last year. A major reason for the slide is the company\u2019s struggles to meet production targets for its lower-priced Model 3 car. Delays, of course, raise questions about Tesla\u2019s ability to become an efficient mass producer of autos. The company needs to sell a significantly higher number of cars to generate the cash to finance its business and meet debt payments. Tesla is expected early this week to release its first-quarter production and delivery numbers.  Electrek, a publication that covers electric vehicles, reported late Monday morning that Mr. Musk had sent out an email to employees saying that the company was producing more than 2,000 Model 3s a week. Tesla\u2019s stock bounced after the report.  Tesla\u2019s technology is also facing intense scrutiny after one of its Model X cars crashed on March 23, killing the driver. Tesla said late Friday that its assisted driving system, called Autopilot, was engaged in the car before its collision with a concrete divider. As our colleague Neal E. Boudette wrote:  The accident renews questions about Autopilot, a signature feature of Tesla vehicles, and whether the company has gone far enough to ensure that it keeps drivers and passengers safe.  Tesla\u2019s website says one of Autopilot\u2019s safety features is \u201cAutomatic Emergency Braking.\u201d But a Tesla owner\u2019s manual warns riders that this feature \u201cis not designed to avoid a collision.\u201d Wired recently reported that systems like Autopilot are not necessarily designed to detect static obstacles. In the words of one expert:  Raj Rajkumar, who researches autonomous driving at Carnegie Mellon University, thinks those assumptions concern one of Tesla\u2019s key sensors. \u201cThe radars they use are apparently meant for detecting moving objects (as typically used in adaptive cruise control systems), and seem to be not very good in detecting stationary objects,\u201d he says.  Doubts about the fundamental capabilities of Tesla\u2019s Autopilot could crimp demand for its cars among a customer base that is often seeking the best technology.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Questions are also swirling around the timing of Tesla\u2019s announcement about the crash. In its first communication about the accident, the company said:  Out of respect for the privacy of our customer and his family, we do not plan to share any additional details until we conclude the investigation.  The investigation is not over. Yet Tesla went ahead and provided its update on Friday. The motive for doing so is not clear. The United States National Transportation Safety Board on Sunday said it was \u201cunhappy\u201d that Tesla had released information about the crash.  - Peter Eavis  Investors are running from FAANG stocks again.  Tech companies are again dragging down stocks on Wall Street.  The S.&P. 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite are off 3.1 percent and 3.5 percent Monday. The continued fall in the share prices of some of the biggest tech companies is weighing heavily on the indexes.  Amazon is down 5.4 percent, Netflix is off 5.9 percent, Facebook fell 3 percent, Google-parent Alphabet slipped 3.6 percent and Apple dropped 5.9 percent.  After leading the market higher for much of the past two years, tech stocks have hit some turbulence. Since March 16, Facebook, Alphabet, Netflix and Amazon are all down more than 12 percent, while Apple is down 7.3 percent.  Over that period the business models of those companies have come under increased scrutiny. News that Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm hired by President Trump\u2019s 2016 election campaign, gained access to private information on more than 50 million Facebook users has weighed not only on the shares of Facebook but on Alphabet as well. Amazon, meanwhile, has come under attack from President Trump.  In all, those companies have lost more than $300 billion in market value the past two weeks.  Photo  Trump continues to go after Amazon.  President Trump attacked the e-commerce again on Monday morning.  Monday\u2019s tweet is the latest over the past five days from Mr. Trump criticizing Amazon. Over that period, Mr. Trump has accused Amazon of not paying enough taxes, of putting thousands of local retailers out of business and of using the United States Postal Service as its \u201cDelivery Boy.\u201d  Mr. Trump\u2019s willingness to again single out Amazon and characterize it as a tax cheat and a job killer is a remarkable use of the presidential bully pulpit that could have serious implications for the company even without any formal moves by the federal government.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Amazon\u2019s shares are down 4 percent and are off nearly 11 percent since Axios reported on Wednesday about Mr. Trump\u2019s anger toward the company.  Context  \u2022 Amazon has said that the Postal Regulatory Commission, which oversees the service, has consistently found that its contracts with Amazon are profitable.  \u2022 The internet giant collects sales taxes on its own products in all 45 states that have one, but third-party vendors who sell products on the site often do not collect sales tax, a fact that rivals say is unfair. In addition, some municipalities complain that the company does not collect local taxes.  Critic\u2019s corner  DA Davidson analyst Tom Forte wrote in a note via Reuters:  \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s comments are consistent with industry sources we have spoken to in the shipping industry, who often label Amazon\u2019s deal with the USPS as a sweetheart deal. An argument, however, could be made that the USPS was losing billions before it expanded its service offerings for Amazon and would, still, likely lose billions if Amazon discontinued its use of the USPS tomorrow.\u201d  Intel isn\u2019t helping, either.  Shares of the chip maker are down 9 percent, their steepest decline in more than two years, after Bloomberg reported that Apple is planning to use its own chips in Mac computers beginning as early as 2020.  Citing anonymous sources, Bloomberg\u2019s Ian King and Matt Gurman report:  \u201cThe initiative, code named Kalamata, is still in the early developmental stages, but comes as part of a larger strategy to make all of Apple\u2019s devices \u2014 including Macs, iPhones, and iPads \u2014 work more similarly and seamlessly together.\u201d  Apple provides Intel with about 5 percent of its annual revenue.  Who says there are no rivalries in the hedge fund world?  Kenneth C. Griffin\u2019s Citadel has just hired Phil Villhauer, a former top trader at Steven A. Cohen\u2019s investment firm. Mr. Villhauer will become deputy head of global equities at Citadel, a newly created position. He will officially join the Chicago-based hedge fund in the middle of April and work out of Citadel\u2019s office in New York, a Citadel spokesman confirmed.  \u201cWe see this as a big hire for us,\u201d said Zia Ahmed, a Citadel spokesman.  Mr. Villhauer left Mr. Cohen\u2019s family office, Point72 Asset Management, in October after working for the billionaire investor for roughly 15 years. Mr. Villhauer had started at Mr. Cohen\u2019s former firm, SAC Capital Advisors, and most recently served as head of global trading at Point72.  The timing of Mr. Villhauer\u2019s departure came just months before Mr. Cohen was to begin managing money for outside investors.  In January, Mr. Cohen reconfigured Point72 as a hedge fund after establishing it as a family office in 2014 to manage $11 billion of his personal wealth. Point72 has said it has raised between $2 billion and $4 billion in outside money.

He was there when SAC turned into a powerhouse hedge fund, and he was there when the fund pleaded guilty to insider trading charges in 2013. The guilty plea required the firm to stop managing money for outside investors.  When Mr. Villhauer left Point72, Mr. Cohen, in a letter to employees, called the departure a \u201cretirement\u201d and said he was sad to see Mr. Villhauer go.  Now Mr. Villhauer will start a new chapter in his career at another well-known hedge fund firm.  ____________________________  Photo  Why Facebook\u2019s rivals have stayed mum  As Facebook lurches from crisis to crisis, other tech leaders like Marc Benioff and Tim Cook have criticized the company. But, for the most part, it\u2019s in their culture to stick together, Nick Wingfield writes.  Part of the silence, people in the industry say, comes from a desire to avoid the business equivalent of bad karma \u2014 knowing that they, too, may one day face the buzz saw of public censure.  Customers have less trouble speaking out, but those looking to punish major tech companies are finding that but boycotts are easier said than done.

Elon Musk recently proposed a new compensation plan at Tesla. If approved, he will receive billions of dollars in compensation if he manages to double, triple and quadruple the value of the company. He will receive nothing if he does not.  Rick Smith, the chief executive of Axon, followed Mr. Musk\u2019s lead and proposed a nearly identical plan, albeit with smaller targets for the market valuation.  Mr. Musk and Mr. Smith are outliers. But even for less ambitions executives, the same principle holds.  \u201cYou want the C.E.O. fully aligned and driving a strong return on the investment,\u201d said Shirl Penney, the founder of Dynasty Financial Partners. \u201cThe investors want the senior leadership team as all in as possible.\u201d  Not everyone is willing to put all their eggs in one basket, however.

But it can be virtually impossible for executives or founders at private start-ups, many of whom have preferred stock or founders shares that are illiquid until a sale or initial public offering.  \u201cSelling or diversifying out of that stock has not only a financial ramification for it, but could have ramifications around who much control they have,\u201d said Mr. Penney.  And when start-up executives and founders do sell, the results can vary widely. Peter Thiel, an early investor in Facebook, has sold most all of his shares in the company, even as he remains a board member. It\u2019s a prudent bet \u2014 Facebook shares are hovering near their all-time high.  Photo  But sometimes, selling too early can be disastrous. Ronald Wayne, a co-founder of Apple, sold his stake in the company for $800 in 1976. That stock would today have been worth about $90 billion today, making him one of the richest men in the world.  Even if an executive or founder does want to sell stock, they need to be careful about not timing any sales to create the impression that they have lost faith in the company, or were trading on nonpublic information.  Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich recently drew scrutiny for selling about $39 million worth of shares after the company learned of a major security flaw in its chips, but before the news was made public.  Intel said the sale was unrelated to security issues and was part of a prearranged annual trading plan.

Sophisticated financial planners have myriad ways to minimize risk, beyond simply diversifying. Executives with large stock holdings can hedge their positions, minimizing downside risk. Sometimes it\u2019s possible to sell upside call options.  And in so-called exchange funds, executives from various companies will pool their stock into a fund run by an asset manager, diversifying their exposure without having to sell shares and pay any immediate capital gains taxes.  Even then, however, undue complexity can backfire. In 2012, the founder of Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, Robert Stiller, was ousted as chairman of his own company after he sold five million shares, worth about $125 million. His motivation: he had taken out loans against his sizable stake in Green Mountain, now known as Keurig Green Mountain, but when the value of the shares fell, Mr. Stiller was caught in a margin call.  The most common pitfall for executives who are rewarded with stock, however, is simply ignorance. Too often, planners say, executives don\u2019t know what they have, or what options they are entitled to. Frequently, people become aware of their options only at the last minute, or even after the fact.  \u201cThe worst-case scenario is that those options expire in the money,\u201d said Mr. Senseney. \u201cWaiting too long can be devastating.

A Tesla representative declined to comment on the company\u2019s finances.  But the company\u2019s recent troubles extend beyond its balance sheet. Federal investigators are looking into a fiery crash that killed a Tesla driver last week in California, including the possibility that Autopilot was in use. (Autopilot was in use during a 2016 crash in Florida that killed a Tesla driver, but safety officials concluded that the crash did not result from a flaw in the system but found it lacked safeguards to prevent its misuse.)  And on Thursday, Tesla said it was recalling 123,000 Model S cars made before April 2016 to replace bolts that hold a power-steering motor in place. The bolts can become corroded and break, leaving drivers with only manual steering. The company said no crashes or injuries related to the issue had been reported.  Tesla\u2019s reversal of fortune is a jolt for both the company and its chief executive, who had built a reputation not only as a visionary but also as an achiever, masterminding an automotive brand, breaking ground on a battery plant that would be the world\u2019s biggest building, and launching rockets through his SpaceX venture.  For years, Tesla has ridden a wave of enthusiastic support from its customers and a certain set of investors, even though it generated barely any profit in the 15 years since its founding. Company events to present new models tend to have the feel of a religious revival, with hundreds or thousands of owners cheering wildly at each new pronouncement from Mr. Musk. Anticipation for the Model 3 prompted nearly 400,000 prospective customers to put down deposits of $1,000 each.  In November, before a screaming audience of several hundred guests, Mr. Musk unveiled a battery-powered semi truck and a two-seat roadster. He vowed to begin producing the truck by the end of 2019, even though the company does not have a factory to build it, and is still trying to work the kinks out of the Model 3 assembly process at its manufacturing plant in Fremont, Calif.

You add all that up and there\u2019s a real question about whether this company can deliver what it promises.\u201d  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  There\u2019s no doubt Tesla has achieved some breakthroughs that have left the established automakers scrambling to catch up. It has proved that there is a viable market for electric cars, and that they can command premium prices. It has pioneered methods of upgrading cars through software updates beamed over the air, the way iPhones can download new operating systems.  And it was Autopilot that set off a race to develop advanced driver-assistance systems that can guide cars under certain circumstances and actively prevent collisions \u2014 though Tesla\u2019s technology appears to have been surpassed by the self-driving systems from other companies, including G.M. and the Google spinoff Waymo.  Along the way, Mr. Musk has also courted controversy, including his move in 2016 for Tesla to take over SolarCity, a maker of home solar panels run by his cousin. A group of investors has filed a lawsuit contending that Mr. Musk had a conflict of interest because he was SolarCity\u2019s chairman, and this week a judge cleared the way for the case to go forward.  In January, Tesla gave Mr. Musk a new compensation plan tied entirely to the company\u2019s market value and other performance goals. If he hits all of the goals, he could be rewarded with stock worth more than $50 billion.  But the company has repeatedly failed to meet its own targets and deadlines, especially with the Model 3. Mr. Musk originally predicted that the Model 3 would arrive in 2017 and that the car would push the company\u2019s sales to 500,000 cars a year by 2018. He later lowered his prediction to 100,000 Model 3s in 2017. Backtracking again, he said last August that the company hoped to make 20,000 a month by December, and added that \u201cpeople should have zero concerns\u201d about Tesla\u2019s ability to increase its output of the Model 3.  But in the fourth quarter of last year, Tesla made only 2,425 Model 3s. In its most recent plan, it hopes to lift production to 2,500 Model 3s a week. The company is expected to release first-quarter production totals in early April.  The Model 3 is crucial. The company needs to ramp up its Model 3 business to generate revenue so that it can pay back investors and fund development of future vehicles including its electric truck.  Moody\u2019s concluded that Tesla probably needed to raise more than $2 billion from investors to be able to finance its operations, continue capital investment and pay debts and other financial obligations that will come due soon. According to Moody\u2019s, Tesla has $200 million in convertible bonds due later this year, and $900 million due in early 2019.  \u201cLiquidity is going to be very tight by the end of the year,\u201d Bruce Clark, a senior vice president at Moody\u2019s, said in an interview. \u201cThey need to re-establish credibility with the capital markets.\u201d", "stock": "TSLA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-29", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/29/business/tesla-elon-musk.html"}, {"article": "Tesla TSLA 2.13% will soon need money again. The trouble is, raising it suddenly looks a lot more challenging.  Moody\u2019s Investors Service downgraded Tesla\u2019s debt on Tuesday afternoon, citing persistently negative cash flow and continued production issues with the Model 3 mass-market sedan. Moody\u2019s is keeping a negative outlook on the credit due to \u201cthe likelihood that Tesla will have to undertake a large, near-term capital raise in order to refund maturing obligations and avoid a liquidity shortfall.\u201d  Tesla\u2019s bonds due in 2025, issued just last summer, were quoted near 90 cents on the dollar after hours. Meanwhile, the stock is down 23% in about a month, making equity more expensive. There are plenty of reasons that Tesla\u2019s magic touch with the capital markets is fading fast.  For starters, Tesla\u2019s financial statements paint an alarming picture of the group\u2019s long-term viability. Tesla had $3.4 billion in cash and equivalents at the end of the year and raised an additional $550 million from bonds backed by lease payments in February. Not all of that is available for spending. Customer deposits, which are mostly refundable, topped $850 million at last count.  Tesla burned more than $3.4 billion last year in free cash, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures. If that pace were to keep up, Tesla would run out of its usable cash before this year ends. Worse still, there is reason to believe the free cash burn figure was understated.  Tesla booked $666.5 million in upfront payments to install solar-energy systems as an investing cash outflow. That normally would be an operating expense, depressing free cash flow. Tesla also has managed to flatter its operating cash flow picture by stretching its working capital. Accounts payable grew by nearly $530 million in 2017 to about $2.4 billion, while accounts receivable grew by just $15 million. The difference generated more than half a billion in cash. That was a smart move to conserve resources, but the trouble is that eventually these suppliers will demand their money. They won\u2019t be comfortable if Tesla can\u2019t meet its forecast production rate of 2,500 Model 3 cars a week by the end of the first quarter.  Newsletter Sign-up  Production issues are only one part of the Model 3 problem, however. The car doesn\u2019t seem to be in as high demand as Chief Executive Elon Musk once promised investors. Analysts at Bernstein said in a research note last week that fewer than 30% of customers who have been invited to take delivery of the Model 3 have actually done so.  And Tesla can\u2019t simply cut spending to solve its cash challenge if it hopes to ramp up production. The company has racked up about $10 billion in long- term debt and has $23 billion in total liabilities. To survive long term, Tesla needs to stop overpromising and to scale back its ambitions to goals it actually can achieve. Right now, though, it just needs more money.  More debt isn\u2019t a practical solution given the current bondholder losses. An equity raise is still possible, but the recent selloff across the tech sector won\u2019t help\u2014nor will the fact that the reality of the Model 3 has so far proven to be much less attractive than the fantasy of yesteryear.  If next week\u2019s delivery update is worse than feared, the odds of keeping the lights on through this year will get a lot longer.

Amazon hadn\u2019t just invaded the home turf of the home-shopping channel QVC. As it has done with food delivery, travel and online payments, the Seattle giant had more or less recreated a rival\u2019s entire approach. In this case, the weapon was an online show, \u201cStyle Code Live,\u201d staffed with bubbly millennials promoting beauty and fashion products you could buy on Amazon.  \u201cThey tried to copy everything about our show,\u201d QVC Chief Executive Officer Mike George said in an interview.  Usually, this is the moment that foreshadows doom for a rival. But QVC didn\u2019t bend to Jeff Bezos\u2019s iron will. In May 2017, a little more than a year after introducing \u201cStyle Code Live,\u201d Amazon canceled the show. The retreat proved that QVC\u2019s formula\u2014unscripted hosts demonstrating products to an audience of mostly women on live television\u2014isn\u2019t as easy as it looks. (Amazon declined to comment.)  QVC hasn\u2019t been immune to the ongoing struggles in retail and television. It had four straight quarters of sales declines before posting an increase last quarter. Sales in some categories, such as hair care and jewelry, have continued to struggle. Like many other pay-TV networks, QVC\u2019s main channel has lost subscribers as more consumers drop their cable subscriptions.  But QVC isn\u2019t just another channel trying to adapt to the rise of cord-cutting or a retail brand looking for a toehold online. About half of QVC sales already happen online, and two-thirds of those purchases come from mobile devices. In January, after completing a $2.1 billion purchase of its rival, the Home Shopping Network, QVC Group became the third largest e-commerce retailer in North America, according to Internet Retailer. That means the combined cable channels trail only Amazon.com Inc. and Walmart Inc. among companies selling products in multiple categories.  Wall Street has noticed, with shares of QVC Group, which includes QVC and smaller retail brands, soaring 51 percent in the past year. The company is owned by John Malone\u2019s Liberty Interactive Corp., which lists the business as a separate tracking stock to reflect its value.  The executives running a channel whose name stands for Quality, Value, Convenience believe their business can survive because it does something that Amazon can't: \u201cYou\u2019re not going to be inspired by Amazon,\u201d said George, a 56-year-old former McKinsey & Co. partner who buys Keurig machines on QVC as birthday gifts. \u201cShopping should be joyful. It should be inspirational. That\u2019s what we can do.\u201d  On set at the QVC campus in West Chester, Pennsylvania. Source: QVC  Standing next to a clothing rack on a recent morning, QVC host Pat James-Dementri urged viewers not to wait to buy a blouse and tank-top set. Order now, she said using a familiar lure, and you can get 30 percent off. She translated the price into the channel's signature math: \u201cThree easy pays of $16.66.\u201d  In a dark room perched above the studio, producer Kevin McGovern wore a headset and monitored two screens. One tracked call volume; the other showed the colors and sizes left. The wine-colored blouse was the hot item this morning, and that real-time dashboard helped create a sense of urgency with shoppers at home. McGovern whispered into the host\u2019s earpiece, and the information went out to QVC\u2019s 100 million homes in James-Dementri\u2019s bright voice: \u201cThe wine is flying out of here!\u201d she told viewers.  While the format looks easy, a complex ballet takes place behind the scenes to make things go smoothly. There are no teleprompters or scripts. QVC hosts improvise, fielding calls and social media questions from viewers in real time. The channel features 770 products each week on the air in the U.S., and the average shopper spends more than $1,200 a year on the network\u2019s products.  \u201cQVC is a retail format that appeals to a woman who loves to shop. It would appear this woman is born every year.\u201d  QVC broadcasts every day, except on Christmas, from a 58,000-square-foot campus in West Chester, Pennsylvania, about 30 miles outside of Philadelphia. The main studio has more than 20 sets that resemble scenes torn from a Pottery Barn catalog, with plush couches and spotless kitchens. There's a 130-seat theater used for live segments with such celebrities as chef Rachel Ray or Catherine Zeta-Jones, who recently launched a home collection. A warehouse nicknamed Noah\u2019s Ark holds 300,000 items\u2014at least two of everything that QVC features on TV each day. There are parallel broadcast operations in seven countries, including China.  In one room, a headless mannequin wore a bra as part of an upcoming segment on Breezies underwear, which was to be a featured item known as \u201cToday\u2019s Special Value.\u201d On a brightly lit set nearby, Dennis Basso, a charismatic white-haired fashion designer, held up one of his dresses as the cameras rolled. \u201cI'm telling you,\u201d Basso said, \u201cthis is sooooo special.\u201d  Seated in a conference room at QVC\u2019s headquarters, George talks about the marriage with Home Shopping Network as something that will do more than save costs or unite celebrity pitchwomen: Serena Williams and Nicki Minaj sell clothing and perfume on HSN, while Martha Stewart and Ellen DeGeneres pitch home d\u00e9cor, beauty products and other items on QVC. The combined channels, George argues, will have the resources to innovate.  HSN was the pioneer in shopping by remote control instead of requiring viewers to pick up the phone or visit a website. Following the merger, George said, QVC is in talks with Comcast Corp. to enable the cable giant\u2019s 22 million subscribers to order items on the channel from their remote controls.  But that strategy will pay off only if QVC viewers keep their cable TV subcriptions. \u201cWe expect QVC to have more difficulty acquiring new customers,\u201d Citi analyst Jason Bazinet wrote in a September note that downgraded its parent company\u2019s stock to sell.  And the shoppers that are sticking around aren\u2019t young. George describes the typical viewer as an upscale woman in her 50s. A recent summary of the stereotypical QVC fan in Philadelphia magazine evoked \u201csilver-haired grannies ordering slow cookers and vibrating belly bands from landline phones.\u201d The public perception of a certain fustiness to the home-shopping demographic makes it challenging to attract millennials.  \u201cIf you go to other online retailers, it\u2019s a transaction. When you come to QVC, it\u2019s a social experience.\u201d  QVC executives insist they\u2019re mostly protected from the pressures facing both TV networks and brick-and-mortar retailers. Cord-cutters are cost-conscious young men, they say, while QVC viewers are women of a certain age with enough disposable income to afford cable-TV subscriptions and discretionary purchases. QVC executives refer to their viewers, who are about 80 percent female, simply as \u201cshe\u201d and \u201cher.\u201d  Those celebrity deals also give the channel a measure of protection by ensuring those products aren\u2019t available on Amazon. Martha Stewart\u2019s chambray blouse and electric snowblower are exclusive to the channel, and her on-air appearances are also streamed live on her Facebook page, introducing many of Stewart\u2019s fans to the shopping channel.  To reach the younger generation, QVC introduced a TV channel, Beauty IQ, that is simulcast on Facebook Live and features beauty experts who have big followings on Instagram and YouTube. In 2015, two years before the deal for the Home Shopping Network, QVC also paid $2.4 billion for Zulily, a flash sales site aimed at millennial moms.    QVC\u2019s digital strategy has started to pay off. The channel added about 417,000 new customers last quarter, the second-biggest increase for that period in 15 years. Amazon is perpetually lurking, of course. It has started to broaden Twitch Interactive, a video-game streaming site it acquired in 2014, to allow artists, chefs and musicians to sell products to their viewers. And about three-quarters of QVC shoppers are also users of the almost inescapable e-commerce site.  But analysts increasingly see QVC\u2019s future as \u201cthe anti-Amazon,\u201d in the words of Barton Crockett at B. Riley FBR Inc. Amazon is about inexhaustible selection, he said, while a 24-hour shopping show is a matter of constant salesmanship.  \u201cQVC is a retail format that appeals to a woman who loves to shop,\u201d Crockett said. \u201cIt would appear this woman is born every year.\u201d  QVC Control room Source: QVC  Some viewers tune in to just see hosts like David Venable. A 53-year-old former TV news anchor in Altoona, Pennsylvania, Venable got his start at QVC in 1993 selling patio furniture during the overnight shift. Today, he hosts two live cooking shows each week, deploying a folksy manner that evokes his southern upbringing. His nonstop patter is filled with anecdotes about how his grandmother and mother taught him to cook.  \u201cIn the Kitchen With David\u201d is one of QVC\u2019s most popular shows, drawing on average more than 2 million viewers. Wearing his apron, Venable answers questions on social media, makes new recipes and demonstrates cookware. He has sold almost 900,000 air fryers. Whenever Venable tastes a dish he really enjoys, he raises his hands and turns in a circle while saying \u201chappy dance, happy dance\u201d over and over. It\u2019s his signature move.  \u201cWe\u2019re establishing a relationship with viewers,\u201d Venable said in an interview. \u201cIf you go to other online retailers, it\u2019s a transaction. When you come to QVC, it\u2019s a social experience.\u201d  One of his most devoted fans is Cam Brockman, a 23-year-old retail sales associate in Charlotte, North Carolina. Brockman recently tweeted that she was \u201caddicted\u201d to QVC and was \u201cthe only 23-year-old wearing Denim and Co. and planning her life around David Venable.\u201d  Brockman got Venable to sign a copy of his cookbook. On Sundays, she and her boyfriend watch his show during halftime of NFL games.

Amazon.com Inc. is a convenient scapegoat for just about any issue. The mail is no different.  Amazon isn\u2019t killing the post office. Since signing a landmark contract in 2013 to expand their business relationship and deliver packages on Sunday, revenue has ticked up; losses are down; and shipping is just about the only growth segment in the mailbag. The Postal Service is saddled by larger issues. Sure, there\u2019s the internet, and nobody is sending postcards anymore, but the big financial dilemma is the agency\u2019s yearly obligation to set aside cash to cover health care costs for future retirees. This accounts for billions in losses.  Give Up? U.S. Postal Service makes small improvements but is nowhere close to sustainable Source: U.S. Postal Service  U.S. mail is also required to cover every American, employing carriers who roam neighborhoods six days a week (or seven, if Amazon has a package ready). The Postal Service has said it actually makes money on the Amazon deal. E-commerce revenue provides \u201cessential support to pay for the network and infrastructure that enables us to fulfill our universal service obligation,\u201d David Partenheimer, a spokesman for the Postal Service, wrote in a January op-ed. \u201cAll users of the mail benefit.\u201d  The Amazonification of U.S. Mail Shipping revenue overtook junk mail for the first time last year Source: U.S. Postal Service  Amazon rebuilt its delivery network around the post several years ago. The company operates \u201c sortation centers\u201d that complement warehouses and organize packages by zip code before sending them to post offices for the final leg of delivery. In Kenosha, Wisconsin, Amazon has a million-square-foot warehouse, connected to a 500,000-square-foot sort center with a covered conveyor belt that resembles an airport skybridge.  Ending the U.S. mail relationship would probably be a bigger setback for Amazon than for the Postal Service. On a dark day in late 2011 when the postmaster general proposed cutting 100,000 staff and shutting thousands of post offices, EBay Inc. shares dropped more than 6 percent. Amazon\u2019s deal came soon after, and radical cuts were avoided\u2014probably not a coincidence.  So the e-commerce giant got the Postal Service off life support, but any benefit beyond that is minimal. Nothing short of a complete overhaul of the mail system, some kind of bankruptcy-style financial restructuring or reneging on those health-care promises would turn the Postal Service into a sustainable business.  Maybe that\u2019s Trump\u2019s goal. Building an antitrust case against Amazon\u2014an idea the President has floated\u2014is a tall order. Amazon\u2019s five-year contract with the Postal Service could be up for renewal this year.

Getty/Stephen Brashear  Amazon Go is Amazon's futuristic store that uses cameras and sensors to charge customers for what they take from shelves.  Loup Ventures' Andrew Murphy thinks that Amazon will license the tech for other stores.  In this way, Amazon would have a \"Trojan horse\" into traditional brick-and-mortar retail.  Amazon may be going in another direction with its \"just-walk-out\" technology.  According to a new bit of analysis from Loup Ventures' Andrew Murphy, Amazon could leverage the technology in Amazon Go \u2014 the company's futuristic store that uses sensors, not cashiers, to correctly charge customers for what they take \u2014 in a different way than anticipated.  Instead of simply opening more Amazon Go stores, he thinks the company will instead license the technology to other retailers, which would give Amazon a \"Trojan horse into the brick and mortar retail space.\"  In this way, it would be similar to the infrastructure Amazon built with its cloud-computing platform, AWS, and its third-party marketplace offering, Fulfillment by Amazon.  Amazon is clearly interested in moving into the brick-and-mortar space, and the technology in Amazon Go could be \"a turnkey solution for automated retail,\" Murphy said.  This probably doesn't mean you're going to see the tech in general merchandise competitors like Walmart or Target, but specialty retailers, like Nike, that already sell their goods on Amazon could look to add it to their growing retail presence. It could save on labor costs, or ensure workers focus on customer service instead of rote jobs like cashing out customers.  The race to automate cashiers' jobs as Amazon Go does has the company in the \"pole position\" to cash in on what Murphy says is a $50 billion opportunity for retailers.  The technology could be a strong driver to bring more brands into the fold as the company courts more and higher-end brands to work with.  Amazon partnered with Calvin Klein over the holidays, using its Echo smart speakers in fitting rooms to answer customers' questions or change the lighting.

He reportedly feels that Amazon is not paying its fair share of taxes, and has previously claimed that The Washington Post is being used to cover up Amazon's supposed evasion, as Jeff Bezos runs Amazon and owns the newspaper. President Trump is also unhappy with how he believes Amazon is hurting the retail industry, and brick-and-mortar retailers in particular.  President Trump does not currently have a specific plan to attack Amazon, and one may never comes to pass, but there are several ways he could go about it.  Antitrust regulation: Amazon captures a huge percentage of US e-commerce sales and e-commerce growth, without showing signs of slowing down, which has led many to consider the case that it is a monopoly that should be broken up. Such a case would not be close to a slam dunk, as it's unclear if Amazon is a threat to competition or considered to be one under antitrust laws. But if it was successful, the resulting regulations would alter Amazon significantly.

President Trump could lead the charge on finding ways to increase Amazon's federal tax bill in order to take a bigger piece of its revenue and hinder the company.

President Trump could lead the charge on finding ways to increase Amazon's federal tax bill in order to take a bigger piece of its revenue and hinder the company. Sales taxes:Amazon collects sales tax in jurisdictions where it is required to, but online sales tax laws vary from state-to-state and city-to-city, and this complexity leads to Amazon not having to collect taxes in certain places. Additionally, in many states, Amazon does not collect taxes for sales from its third-party vendors, leaving it up to them. However, many of these merchants are unclear of their responsibilities, and therefore hesitate to charge sales tax. Although some states are looking into the missing taxes, others have yet to make an effort to solve the problem; until every affected state starts cracking down, Amazon's marketplace will continue to have a price advantage over competitors. If President Trump were to make a push for tougher online sales taxes nationwide, it could give him his desired result of a weakened Amazon.  Meanwhile, the company is still selecting the location for its second headquarters, and has fielded bids that could further shield it from taxes. Amazon has received a number of bids that feature tax breaks, the ability to keep its employees' income taxes, and likely much more, all of which would make it easier for Amazon to pay less in taxes. While these deals would be valuable to Amazon, the potentially extreme level of tax immunity they provide may lead to public backlash, which could bring on new regulations and laws that would hurt the company.", "stock": "AMZN", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-29", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-how-president-trump-could-go-after-amazon-2018-3"}, {"article": "BI Intelligence  This story was delivered to BI Intelligence Transportation and Logistics Briefing subscribers hours before it appeared on Business Insider.

Amid President Donald Trump's ongoing public feud with Amazon, CNBC reports that the e-commerce behemoth has been fighting with UPS for the past few years.  The argument seems to be over the United States Postal Service's (USPS) cost structure, which has a direct impact on Amazon, its largest and most highly publicized customer, as well as UPS, which has struggled to lower its prices to match USPS' rates. Amazon's relationship with USPS directly affects the competitive landscape of parcel deliveries in the US, a market in which UPS and FedEx are the dominant players.  The dispute stems from how USPS splits up its fixed costs \u2014 including driver salaries, trucking fees, and other overhead expenses \u2014 between its two business segments. The two units are its letter business, a government-protected monopoly, and the competitive parcel business, which competes with UPS, FedEx, and other parcel delivery companies.  Under the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006, USPS is currently required to cover at least 5.5% of its fixed costs with revenue from its competitive business. Competing logistics providers, however, argue that this low-cost coverage requirement is outdated because of the explosive growth in e-commerce over the last few years \u2014 the competitive business now accounts for 30% of USPS' total revenue, up from only 11% a decade ago.  Last year, UPS argued in a filing with the Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC) that the law gave the postal service an unfair competitive advantage. That's because USPS can cover a large portion of its costs with its letter business, and therefore offer lower prices than other logistics companies.  Amazon routes the majority of its deliveries through USPS as a result of these lower rates, meaning UPS and other logistics providers are losing out on a plethora of business. Moreover, the e-tailer has argued for keeping the requirement as is, saying that a higher minimum would provide no benefits to stakeholders and isn't necessary to create a level playing field. UPS argued in its filing that the postal service's competitive business should cover a much larger share of its fixed costs, somewhere around 29%.  Tensions between the e-commerce titan and logistics companies will only intensify as Amazon moves further into the logistics market over the next few years.Amazon's well-publicized ambitions in the logistics space have grown more intense over the last few months, and will likely only continue to become more serious. It launched Fulfillment by Amazon, which allows third-party sellers to store and ship some of their products in the online retailer's proprietary logistics network, way back in 2006, and it now serves millions of retailers around the world.  Last year, the company started trialing Seller Flex in several locations on the West Coast, which took over management of its third-party sellers' deliveries to speed up delivery times and lower costs, and last month, The Wall Street Journal reported that the company is preparing to launch a stand-alone shipping service for any retailer. Amazon still has a long way to go before it even comes close to posing a direct threat to UPS, FedEx, and DHL, but as it continues to make inroads into the logistics space, it's likely that the company will only further inflame these existing tensions.", "stock": "AMZN", "label": 1, "date": "2018-04-09", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-and-ups-were-feuding-before-trump-2018-4"}, {"article": "Photo  The fledgling plan from Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase to create an independent health care system for their American employees is just as bare-bones as it is bold.

AMZN -1.22% has tapped NBC Entertainment President Jennifer Salke to head Amazon Studios, its movie and television unit, succeeding Roy Price, who resigned amid allegations that he engaged in sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior toward a producer.  At Amazon, Ms. Salke, 53 years old, will oversee a deep-pocketed and ambitious online video service with an annual budget of more than $4.5 billion, according to people at the company.  Its best-known television series include \u201cTransparent,\u201d \u201cThe Tick\u201d and \u201cBosch.\u201d Its most successful films have been \u201cThe Big Sick\u201d and Oscar winner \u201cManchester by the Sea.\u201d However Amazon has struggled to find broadly popular hits like HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and Netflix Inc.\u2019s \u201cStranger Things.\u201d  Among the challenges facing Ms. Salke will be improving relations with the creative community, some of whom criticized the way Amazon operated during Mr. Price\u2019s seven-year tenure. Several producers expressed frustration at what they called creative interference by Amazon executives, often leading to production delays and greater expenses. David E. Kelley, who created the legal drama \u201cGoliath\u201d for Amazon, told The Wall Street Journal last fall that the company is \u201cin way over their heads.\u201d  \u201cWhat stood out about Jen was the deep relationships she has nurtured with creators and talent over her career,\u201d Jeffrey Blackburn, the Seattle-based Amazon executive to whom Ms. Salke will report, said in a statement. \u201cShe\u2019s built an impeccable reputation as a big leader who emphasizes creativity, collaboration, and teamwork.\u201d  Since Mr. Price left in October, Amazon Studios has been overseen by Chief Operating Officer Albert Cheng, whose background is primarily in technology and digital media.  Related Video Amazon wants to deliver everything you want to your doorstep, anywhere in the world. But the e-commerce giant faces several challenges in its pursuit of a global empire. WSJ's Karan Deep Singh breaks down the basics with the help of an Amazon delivery box.  Shortly after Mr. Price stepped down, his lawyer, Eric George, said the executive had never been accused of sexual harassment \u201cwith the sole exception of the incident alleged by [the producer], the portrayal of which he vigorously contests.\u201d  The hiring of Ms. Salke, who has run NBC\u2019s prime-time entertainment since 2011, comes after a very public and drawn-out search for Mr. Price\u2019s successor. A leading candidate, Fox Television Group Chairman and Chief Executive Dana Walden, took herself out of consideration early on; another candidate\u2014A&E Networks Group Chief Executive Nancy Dubuc\u2014was also in the running. Fox\u2019s parent, 21st Century Fox Inc., shares common ownership with News Corp., which owns The Wall Street Journal.  In a statement, Ms. Salke said Amazon has \u201cinnovated, disrupted, and created characters that are already an indelible part of pop-culture.\u201d  One of Ms. Salke\u2019s biggest tasks will be overseeing Amazon\u2019s production of \u201cLord of the Rings,\u201d an ambitious and expensive series based on J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s popular fantasy novels. Amazon won a bidding war for the rights to the series, which was given a multi-season commitment.  Ms. Salke has a solid track record as a television development executive. Shows developed on her watch at NBC include the drama \u201cThis Is Us\u201d and the comedy \u201cThe Good Place.\u201d She also oversees Universal Television, the production studio at NBCUniversal which produces shows for NBC and other networks and services. NBCUniversal is a unit of Comcast Corp.  However, Ms. Salke has no experience running a world-wide digital business or in movies, both of which she will oversee in her new post. Amazon is taking a bet that she can successfully handle those new responsibilities.  Prior to joining NBC, Ms. Salke was a television-studio executive at 21st Century Fox. She started her career at Aaron Spelling Productions.  No successor for Ms. Salke was named by NBC Entertainment Chairman Robert Greenblatt. Other senior entertainment executives who will likely be under consideration include Pearlena Igbokwe, who is president of Universal Television, and NBC programming executives Bruce Evans and Lisa Katz.

Among its biggest clients are companies like Walmart and Nestl\u00e9. It also disclosed a list of banks and trade companies using its blockchain.  Blockchain technology is often associated with cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, but enterprises are taking it on as a new tool for trade and payments.  IBM's foray into blockchain technology is catching on with customers, according to an investor briefing shared by the company on Thursday.  At least 400 IBM customers are now running blockchain-based projects, according to the briefing. Among those customers are 63 that work together with certain themes: 25 companies in global trade, 14 companies in food tracking, and 14 companies in global payments. Some of IBM's most recognizable blockchain clients include Nestl\u00e9, Visa, Walmart, and HSBC.  While blockchains continue to be widely associated with startups and crypto-millionaires, IBM's client list shows that large enterprises are truly embracing the technology.  IBM and Walmart actually launched a joint food safety blockchain project globally last year, which enables the grocery chain to figure out where specific produce originated in a matter of seconds.  Why the blockchain?  Blockchains, the technology that underlies cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, have caught on in enterprise as an efficient and comprehensive way of tracking both physical and digital items \u2014 from inventory to online payments. Often, these blockchains are decentralized, meaning they're spread across many machines on a network. This redundancy makes it difficult for any one party to falsify the information contained on the blockchain.  Conventionally, blockchains like the one that powers bitcoin are public, so that anyone can see the changes that are made. It's an important aspect of most cryptocurrencies that the blockchain is accessible to all, to eliminate the possibility of shady dealings.  But IBM's product, which is built on top of an open-source blockchain called Hyperledger Fabric, uses \"permissioned networks.\" This means companies can have some of the information on their bespoke blockchain be publicly viewable, and some of it locked behind a password or other security mechamism.  A global trader like the Dow Chemical Company (an IBM blockchain user) may want to have an immutable receipt between itself and its trade partners in order to guarantee that no one is being scammed. But it doesn't necessarily want that information to be viewable by its competitors \u2014 or, say, the media.  In global shipping, IBM's clients include Maersk, Du Pont and Dow Chemical. Its food trust customers include Walmart, Nestl\u00e9, Kroger and Unilever. Its global payment customers include Visa, the Polynesian payments company KlickEx, EarthPort, Nab,, BBVA and CIBC. And in trade finance, IBM's customers include Societe General, WeTrade, HSBC, Unicredit, and Santander.  They're not the only ones rushing towards the blockchain, either. JD.com, the Amazon of China, is launching a project to put high-end beef imports on a blockchain so that its customers can see where their meat has been.  Editor's note: The original headline for this story said IBM has at least 63 blockchain clients. The actual number is over 400.

Six years later, Intel agreed to sell a majority stake of that business to the investment firm TPG.  Ms. James was considered a candidate to succeed Paul Otellini, who stepped down as Intel chief executive in May 2013. Instead, she and Brian Krzanich successfully pitched Intel directors on a joint plan to run the company.  She was named president, the highest-ranking job ever held by a woman at the company, and Mr. Krzanich became chief executive. Ms. James later decided to seek a chief executive spot elsewhere, opting in early 2016 to first become an operating executive at Carlyle.  Ms. James learned management skills from Andrew Grove, the acclaimed former Intel chief. Before he died in 2016, she said, Mr. Grove encouraged her to follow her dream of a chip start-up \u2014 a plan with parallels to the 1968 founding of Intel as a breakaway from a chip pioneer, Fairchild Semiconductor.  \u201cHe said, \u2018I just want you to know, this is a really hard job,\u2019\u201d Ms. James recalled. \u201cI said: \u2018I know.

One selling point is reduced power consumption, a hot topic in data centers.  Ampere\u2019s underlying technology originated at Applied Micro Circuits, which built three generations of ARM-based server chips. The Silicon Valley company was acquired in early 2017 by Macom Technology Solutions, which in October agreed to sell the business to what is now Ampere. Essentially all of Applied Micro\u2019s 300-person development team joined the new venture, Ms. James said.  She declined to disclose how much Carlyle was investing but said Ampere was well funded.

Ms. James sounds undaunted. She said Ampere\u2019s chips topped rival products on price, speedy connections to retrieve data from memory and other features.

When you get bored you ignite the \u2018default mode\u2019 in your brain, and this is where we do our most original thinking  \u201cThere is nothing new about the existence of an attention economy that monetises our eyeballs,\u201d says Cal Newport, associate professor of computer science at Georgetown University and author of Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World. \u201cBut when you combine this business model with powerful handheld devices that are always connected to the internet, algorithms being weaponized to extract as much of our time and attention as possible, and hundreds of billions of dollars of investment, suddenly the societal impacts become worrisome.\u201d  Prof Newport is worried about the next generation. \u201cIt is almost certainly true that young people are suffering a rapid decline in their ability to concentrate. Given the increasing share of the economy dedicated to knowledge work, in which concentrated thought is the primary driver of value production, this decline might start to impact large scale economic metrics, if it hasn\u2019t already\u201d.  Overcoming overload is hard, because we are addicted to information \u2014 or, more specifically, to novelty  If information overload stops us concentrating deeply, it also stops us resting deeply \u2014 and that is just as damaging. Boredom, zoning out and absent-mindedness are all fertile mental states for creativity. \u201cWe\u2019re at an interesting moment in neuroscience in terms of understanding how boredom is a gateway to mind-wandering,\u201d says Manoush Zomorodi, host of the WNYC podcast Note to Self and author of Bored and Brilliant.  \u201cWhen you get bored, say you are folding laundry, or doing something that doesn\u2019t require focused attention, you ignite the \u2018default mode\u2019 in your brain, and this is where we do our most original thinking,\u201d she says. \u201cWe take two seemingly disparate ideas and smash them together to make something new. And we do autobiographical planning. We look back at our life, take note of highs and lows, create personal narratives, and look at our future and decide where we want to go.\u201d  If in a quiet moment we instead check for emails or social media updates, then we may be in danger of losing the experience of boredom entirely.  Overcoming overload is hard, because we are addicted to information \u2014 or, more specifically, to novelty. This was helpful in the hunter-gatherer era, because it could lead us to food and resources. It is less helpful online, where we cannot ever be satiated. Companies are tapping this foraging-related brain circuitry to make products more addictive. One gamification firm, with clients including Disney and Google, even named itself Dopamine, after the brain chemical.  Some of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest names are raising the alarm, from Facebook\u2019s founding president Sean Parker to former Google design ethicist Tristan Harris.  Is there a solution?  \u00a9 EPA  Yet there are glimmers of hope. Consumers, and even investors, are paying more attention to the problem. Facebook published a study confirming that its users do indeed feel worse after \u2018passively\u2019 consuming social media. It argued however that social media increased wellbeing when people used them actively, especially when \u201csharing messages, posts and comments with close friends and reminiscing about past interactions\u201d. It recently announced changes to its news feed, to prioritise the sharing of meaningful content between friends.  At work, companies are deploying software, artificial intelligence and machine learning to bring order and structure to the informational chaos that many office workers now feel. Slack can reduce email overload by shifting high-volume, open-ended communications into chat forums. IBM Verse and SalesforceIQ sift information and prioritise actions for staff. Google has rolled out auto-reply suggestions on Gmail, with algorithms proposing possible replies to messages, and tools like Evernote consolidate scattered online and offline notes, links and resources.  Then there are the apps and internet blockers which forcibly disconnect people from certain sites, or during certain times, including Thrive App, from Arianna Huffington\u2019s wellbeing consultancy and Samsung.  The power of the humble notebook  Meanwhile Prof Newport, who gained tenure at the young age of 33 without working in the evenings or at weekends, says the humble notebook is his tool of choice. His reasons are subtle, relating to the ways in which the finitude of three dimensional space shapes our thinking. \u201cWhen scheduling your day in a notebook, the fact that the page is a fixed size embodies the reality that your time and attention are limited commodities. Days scheduled on paper tend to be more realistic and balanced than those driven [by] a bottomless inbox or voluminous digital task list.\u201d  Research also shows that writing on paper fires up the brain circuitry associated with language processing and engenders more attentive reading. All of which might give us reason to pause before rolling out the tablets, laptops and digital education for an already screen-sapped generation.

Fourth-quarter revenue rose 3.6% to $22.54 billion. The last time IBM had revenue growth from the prior year was the first quarter of 2012, Ms. Rometty\u2019s first as chief.  Several factors drove growth in the latest quarter: sales of industrial-strength computers\u2014which the company typically refreshes every few years\u2014 rose 32% to $3.33 billion, while cloud-computing revenue climbed 30% to $5.5 billion. Also, currency exchange rates have been working in IBM\u2019s favor lately, accounting for 3 percentage points of the quarter\u2019s revenue growth after years of being a headwind.  IBM said it took a $5.5 billion charge related to the new U.S. tax law, helping to push it into the red for the period. Its tax rate, excluding the charge but including certain one-time benefits, was 6%.  In all, the company reported a fourth-quarter loss of $1.05 billion, or $1.14 a share, compared with profit of $4.5 billion, or $4.72 a share, a year earlier.  The loss stemmed partly from a deep erosion in profits in IBM\u2019s services business, showing IBM still has work to do. Pretax profit margins in the two services segments that manage large companies\u2019 software and hardware needs sank 35% and 23%, respectively, from a year ago. In its conference call with analysts, IBM described high investments and \u201clarge contract dynamics\u201d in those businesses.  Since becoming CEO, Ms. Rometty has struggled to shift IBM from older, shrinking businesses, such as selling and maintaining equipment in customers\u2019 own facilities, to newer ones that promise rapid growth.  She has staked out a position in helping large corporate customers integrate their traditional operations with cloud computing, and has focused on buzzy areas such as artificial intelligence and the Internet-based ledger technology known as blockchain.  But growth has been elusive, as even high-profile initiatives\u2014such as IBM\u2019s Watson AI, a collection of cloud tools as well as apps for industries including medicine and finance\u2014haven\u2019t delivered a clear financial boost.  Even some of Ms. Rometty\u2019s biggest fans have lost patience. IBM\u2019s largest and arguably most prominent stakeholder\u2014Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which invested more than $10 billion for a 5.4% stake in 2011\u2014sold more than half its holdings last year. Berkshire held about 37 million shares as of Sept. 30.  Shares of the 106-year-old tech company dropped 3.1% in after-hours trading after finishing Thursday\u2019s regular session with a marginal gain at $169.12. The price stands roughly where it did a year ago, while the S&P 500 index has risen more than 23%.  While achieving quarterly growth is noteworthy, IBM is working toward what it sees as a more significant milestone: getting more than half its revenue from so-called strategic imperatives \u2014 mostly newer technologies such as AI that customers can access in the cloud.  Revenue from strategic imperatives made up 49% of the total in the quarter, edging toward the point at which sales of the higher-growth offerings will outweigh the rest of IBM, heralding faster growth overall.  In an interview, James Kavanaugh, IBM\u2019s new finance chief, said the company is \u201cahead of track\u201d in working toward its goal of hitting an annual revenue rate of $40 billion for strategic imperatives by the end of this year.  \u201cThat gives us the confidence to say we\u2019re going to grow revenue overall in 2018,\u201d he said.  Jim Lebenthal, a portfolio manager at HPM Partners LLC, said there is evidence of Ms. Rometty\u2019s progress. He shed IBM in 2015 after \u201ca lot of disappointments\u201d but recently added the company to his stable of 20 stocks. He is betting IBM\u2019s newfound revenue growth is sustainable and that strategic imperatives will grow to more than 50% of sales in 2018.  When Ms. Rometty took the CEO reins from Samuel Palmisano in January 2012, revenue started slipping almost immediately and the threat of cloud computing to IBM\u2019s traditional businesses became evident. Ms. Rometty purchased cloud-computing platform SoftLayer Technologies Inc. the following year and committed to developing Watson into a flagship offering.  By 2014, it was clear IBM had diverged from Mr. Palmisano\u2019s financial road map for $20-a-share in profit by 2015. Ms. Rometty set aside that goal, reorganized the company around her strategic imperatives and redirected about $4 billion away from stock repurchases toward priorities such as Watson and the cloud, according to UBS AG analyst Steven Milunovich.  IBM\u2019s challenges now include holding on to its large customers as cloud leaders such as Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google beckon.  \u201cStrategic imperative revenue may cross over the core franchises later this year,\u201d Mr. Milunovich said, \u201cbut there are a lot of industry trends working against a large incumbent like IBM.\u201d  Hardware revenue rose 32%, driven by sales of mainframe computers\u2014on IBM\u2019s conference call with analysts, former finance chief Martin Schroeter called mainframes \u201can enduring and growing franchise\u201d\u2014which accounted for nearly 15% of total revenue in the quarter.  Those sales are critical, as they drive related sales of support services, software, storage and financing that historically have made up roughly 40% of IBM\u2019s operating profit, according to analyst Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein Research. They also can cement long-term customer relationships that drive recurring revenue such as software subscriptions, he said.  On an adjusted basis, which omits such items as acquisition- and retirement-related charges, IBM had profit of $5.18 a share, a penny more than the $5.17 expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters.  The Armonk, N.Y., company\u2019s guidance for 2018 called for operating earnings of $13.80 a share and free cash flow of about $12 billion.

As he assessed his opportunities, he became convinced that the tech start-up world had often come up short in meeting society\u2019s challenges.  This area, he said, is where he hopes he can have an impact.  Consider Mr. Chenault some much-needed adult supervision.  \u201cWhat I think is happening right now in the digital space is a maturation cycle and some people, as we\u2019ve seen, are going to handle that well and some people are going to crash and burn,\u201d he said, without naming names.  Of course, he could be talking about any of a host of companies, like Uber, Google or Facebook, the latter of which is facing a revolt among consumers and possibly regulators over the way fake news proliferates on its site.

As start-ups are staying private longer, venture capital firms are finding that someone has to actually run the companies they invest in, to think beyond the early stages of fast growth \u2014 and a quick sale or initial public offering \u2014 and to help them scale over a decade.  \u201cThe median time to I.P.O. has risen dramatically over the last decade, from 4.9 years in 2006 to 8.3 years in 2016,\u201d according to a report from Pitchbook, a data company that tracks deals. Airbnb has been private for 10 years, Uber for nine.  When Mr. Chenault joined Airbnb\u2019s board last week, a company co-founder, Brian Chesky, whom Mr. Chenault has mentored for years, wrote a note to employees announcing the appointment. \u201cMany companies are designed to be finite,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Chesky wrote. \u201cFinite companies are focused on beating their competitors and appeasing short-term interests. But business is not finite. Unlike sports, there is no time clock, so there can be no winning or losing \u2014 there is merely surviving and innovating to endure.\u201d  Mr. Chenault believes there is real value in trying to influence start-ups early in their life cycle, so that patience and foresight become embedded in the DNA.  One problem Mr. Chenault wants to address \u2014 conspicuous to anyone paying attention, but bafflingly inconspicuous to those in the Valley \u2014 is the lack of diversity, both in gender and race, in the tech industry.  \u201cDiversity in the technology digital industry is a big issue,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t make accelerated progress in that area, it will have dire consequences for our society.\u201d  It is even worse in the venture capital industry, where there are few women and even fewer African-Americans.  The numbers are embarrassing and depressing: African-Americans make up only 3 percent of the venture capital work force, according to a study conducted in 2016 by the National Venture Capital Association and Deloitte University Leadership Center for Inclusion. Latinos represented only 4 percent of the venture capital industry.

Intel logo is seen behind LED lights in this illustration taken January 5, 2018. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration  Most of the lawsuits - 30 - are customer class action cases that claim that users were harmed by Intel\u2019s \u201cactions and/or omissions\u201d related to the flaws, which could allow hackers to steal data from computers.  Intel said in a regulatory filing it was not able to estimate the potential losses that may arise out of the lawsuits.  Security researchers at the start of January publicized two flaws, dubbed Spectre and Meltdown, that affected nearly every modern computing device containing chips from Intel, Advanced Micro Devices Inc and ARM Holdings.  The companies have issued fixes but some patches slowed down computers, leading sector analysts to say producers could potentially face suits from clients and consumers claiming damages because their devices did not work as they should.  The company said the remaining two suits were securities class actions, where the plaintiffs allege that Intel and some of its officers violated securities laws by making statements about products or its internal controls that were later revealed to have been false or misleading.  The company\u2019s filing also listed three individual Intel shareholders who had filed actions against members of Intel\u2019s board and other managers, alleging that they failed their duties to Intel by failing to take action in relation to alleged insider trading.  It did not specify what allegations of wrongdoing the suit dealt with.  Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich sold 889,879 shares in the company on Nov. 29 as per a trading plan adopted on Oct. 30, making roughly $39 million from the sale, well before the details of the flaw were made public.  Bloomberg reported last month that although Intel says Krzanich\u2019s sales were part of a pre-arranged stock plan, securities lawyers believed the larger-than-usual transaction could be examined by the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC).  Krzanich said last month that Google researchers told Intel of the flaws \u201ca while ago\u201d.  Google says it informed the affected companies about the Spectre flaw on June 1, 2017 and reported the Meltdown flaw after the first flaw but before July 28, 2017.

Thompson\u2019s favorite drugs, CES, held in Las Vegas each January, has always been a little surreal. This year\u2019s bacchanal was crammed with drones, self-driving cars, and internet-connected toilet seats\u2014and the opening keynote speech was stranger than any of that. On Jan. 8, 5,000 ticket holders made their way through a sea of hired models and ultra-high-definition TVs to the Monte Carlo Resort and Casino on the Strip, where they squeezed into a theater to watch a two-hour psychedelic variety show. The opening act, a Blue Man Group-style quartet called Algorithm \u2019n Blues, pantomimed a performance of Human by the Killers, backed up by a digital bassist on a giant LCD screen, flying drones that played keys on a giant piano, and a trio of acrobats, dressed like extras from Tron, who performed a trampoline routine. And that\u2019s not the weird part.  After the music came Brian Krzanich, chief executive of Intel Corp., doing about the best Willy Wonka impression one can do in a button-down blue dress shirt and jeans. \u201cI\u2019d love nothing more than to simply put my phone away and take this evening to truly celebrate innovation with you,\u201d the 57-year-old CES regular said, bragging about his company\u2019s advances in virtual reality and new partnerships with autonomous-vehicle technology companies. Former NFL quarterback Tony Romo appeared onstage to talk up Intel\u2019s work in 3D video, and Krzanich showed off a full-size pilotless helicopter before capping the evening by suggesting they head outside to see a light show over the famous Bellagio fountains involving hundreds of drones\u2014all, of course, either made by Intel or running on Intel chips.  CEO Krzanich holds Intel\u2019s latest drone, the Shooting Star Mini, as he speaks at CES in Las Vegas on Jan. 8. Photographer: Rick Wilking/Reuters  The whole thing was a dizzying reminder that although Intel isn\u2019t the household name it was during the PC boom of the 1990s, it can still put on a show. The company makes about 90 percent of the world\u2019s computer processors and 99 percent of the server chips in the data centers that effectively run the internet. While the world\u2019s largest chipmaker has struggled to expand beyond those core businesses, it reported $60 billion in 2017 revenue at a gross margin of 63 percent, an unimaginable profit for most factory owners.  What made the Intel keynote so surreal was that Krzanich barely mentioned the potentially catastrophic news that was on everyone\u2019s mind. The previous week, the Register, a British technology journal, reported that independent researchers had discovered flaws in Intel\u2019s chip designs that hackers could exploit to steal data thought to be the most secure. These vulnerabilities, known as Meltdown and Spectre, are a very, very big deal, allowing hackers to peek at the part of the computer where companies and individuals store passwords, encryption keys, and most anything sensitive. The flaws are unprecedented. Every PC, every smartphone, and every server in the world is exposed. The episode has already led to lawsuits and calls for investigations, and undermines more than a decade of Intel\u2019s technical wizardry.  For the past few years, major cloud providers have sought ways to reduce their dependence on Intel\u2019s server chip monopoly, quietly developing their own models or funding nascent competitors. And just days before Krzanich took the stage in Vegas, Intel gave those companies\u2014and everybody else\u2014a massive incentive to accelerate those efforts.  Even the researchers who discovered Meltdown and Spectre initially didn\u2019t believe what they were seeing. \u201cThat would have been such a major f--- -up by Intel that it can\u2019t be possible,\u201d researcher Michael Schwarz recalls thinking. Spectre affects all modern chips, including those made by competitors, but the easier hack, Meltdown, applies almost exclusively to chips made by Intel.  The flaws can be patched, but those patches could slow the Intel chips by as much as 30 percent, the equivalent of turning a state-of-the-art server chip into one from 2013. \u201cThere is no playbook for something like this,\u201d says Charles Carmakal, a vice president at Mandiant, the arm of security company FireEye that consults on high-profile hacks. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen a vulnerability that worked across so many different operating systems and devices.\u201d  If the slowdown turns out to be anywhere near as bad as some think it could be, it\u2019ll amount to a major price increase for data center owners, who could in turn demand that Intel cover the cost. (So far, the big cloud providers have said their customers won\u2019t be affected. Their plans, and the costs, remain unclear.) And because Intel is so reliant on chip revenue, there\u2019d be no easy way to make up those losses. Intel\u2019s stock is down 5 percent since the Register report; shares of Advanced Micro Devices Inc., its only real competitor for PC and server chips, are up 11 percent.  During the six months Intel was quietly working to try to fix the vulnerabilities, Krzanich sold $24 million in company shares. Intel says the stock sale was part of a plan that had been in place before anyone there knew about Meltdown or Spectre, but the day after Krzanich\u2019s CES speech, two U.S. senators sent letters to the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice demanding investigations. Consumer and shareholder lawyers have filed a dozen class actions against Intel, and there are few signs the pressure will let up on Krzanich anytime soon. In a research note, an analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. called the stock sale \u201cindefensible.\u201d  \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen a vulnerability that worked across so many different operating systems and devices\u201d  Intel, which declined to make Krzanich available for comment, has treated Meltdown and Spectre as something close to a nonstory. In its initial statement, issued on Jan. 3, the company disputed that Spectre and Meltdown represented \u201cflaws,\u201d describing them as merely a new field of \u201cresearch\u201d into an industrywide phenomenon. It said any slowdowns would be minimal, close to zero for most people, and that the episode would have no impact on Intel\u2019s business. At CES, after Algorithm \u2019n Blues but before Romo, Krzanich briefly addressed the not-flaw by thanking Intel\u2019s peers for \u201ccoming together\u201d to \u201caddress the recent security findings.\u201d  Intel\u2019s clients, including the biggest companies in the technology industry, have mostly kept quiet. They have no alternative supplier. Privately, some are seething. The day after Krzanich\u2019s big show, Microsoft Corp. published a blog post disputing Intel\u2019s earlier assertion that users wouldn\u2019t notice the slowdowns. Navin Shenoy, an Intel executive vice president, said in a statement that customer security is \u201ca critical priority\u201d for the company. In private conversations with clients, Intel\u2019s top managers haven\u2019t always acted that way, treating a disaster that threatens the security of every computer user and the profits of a whole category of businesses as no big deal, according to an executive at one of Intel\u2019s large customers. The potential fallout isn\u2019t an academic concern, the executive says, \u201cit\u2019s f---ing scary.\u201d  Part of what makes Meltdown and Spectre so terrifying is that they upend more than a decade of conventional wisdom about information security. Starting in the mid-2000s, Intel added a layer of security within its chips and began encouraging developers to store users\u2019 most sensitive information in the walled-off area rather than in regular software memory. Only about two years ago did researchers first notice, and begin trying to crack, a feature called speculative execution that Intel uses to speed up its chips. It essentially allows a chip to access any data it guesses a user is about to ask for, even if it\u2019s inside the secure area, before checking whether the user is allowed to access it. This is a big reason computers and smartphones have kept getting faster year after year. It also left a gaping security hole.  The feature\u2019s vulnerabilities were discussed at conferences and in academic papers but were considered merely theoretical until last spring, when Jann Horn, a 22-year-old researcher in Google\u2019s elite cybersecurity division, succeeded in reading private data from the secure area. Horn informed Intel in June, beating out three other research teams that discovered the flaw later in 2017. Together, they began working with Intel to patch the flaws; until the Register report, they\u2019d planned to disclose their findings on Jan. 9. As Google pointed out in a blog post about the discovery, the security flaws could allow a cloud user to covertly snoop on another customer\u2019s machine. Anyone with an Amazon Web Services account could, in theory, steal another AWS user\u2019s login data and access their files, though that would often require physical access to the target machine.  In interviews, Intel executives dispute suggestions that the company\u2019s focus on chip speeds led it to overlook obvious vulnerabilities. Intel says it\u2019s already provided software fixes for 90 percent of its chips and that this is nothing out of the ordinary. \u201cWe have an ongoing process to make our products better,\u201d says Stephen Smith, general manager of the company\u2019s data center group. \u201cWe just happen to be doing it under a spotlight now.\u201d At CES, Krzanich told the crowd that \u201cas of now\u201d Intel had \u201cnot received any information that these exploits have been used to obtain customer data.\u201d  This sounds more comforting than it probably should. Security analysts say that if four groups of researchers independently figured out the exploits, then some number of governments with sophisticated cyberweapons programs (China, Russia, the U.S.) likely did, too. An intelligence agency armed with Spectre or Meltdown would likely aim big, according to Mandiant\u2019s Carmakal. \u201cA government wouldn\u2019t use this to break into Target,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019d use it to get into the Department of Defense.\u201d  So far, Meltdown and Spectre probably pose less risk to the average person than, say, a simple phishing attack in which a hacker tries to send you to a malicious website. They won\u2019t lead to the kind of widespread panic that resulted from the 2017 hack of Equifax\u2019s customer database.  But that could change. Hackers who hadn\u2019t tried to break into Intel\u2019s hardware, believing there was no way it would leave a side door open, are now seeking ways in. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be looking for other things like this,\u201d says Jeff Pollard, an analyst with the research firm Forrester. \u201cThis is a new kind of attack. This is going to linger.\u201d  And long-term fixes won\u2019t be easy. While coders can pull a few all-nighters to close holes in software, a chip takes years to design, test, and mass-produce. Each model can cost tens of millions of dollars to develop. For now, computer owners and data center operators will have to make an unsavory choice: Use Intel\u2019s software patches and accept slower speeds, or skip the patches and remain at risk. (Intel has already said patches are causing some machines to reboot more often than usual.) Future designs will include hard-wired fixes that speed things up, but the first versions of those won\u2019t appear until later this year, the company says.  All of this puts Intel in a tough spot. The company is a nonfactor in the smartphone-chips business dominated by Samsung, Qualcomm, and ARM, and rival Nvidia has taken a commanding lead in the fast-growing market for graphics chips used in artificial intelligence applications. Now, Meltdown and Spectre threaten the core of Intel\u2019s business. The company has no competitor in server chips at the moment, but this episode could change that. Microsoft and Google have publicly praised Qualcomm Inc.\u2019s first server chip, which went on sale in November, and Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook all have internal divisions working on chip designs.  Intel\u2019s more immediate threat is political. It\u2019ll almost certainly have to withstand criticism from lawmakers at a time when governments around the world are increasingly skeptical of tech companies with de facto monopolies. \u201cThis hyper-dependence on one chipmaker, indeed one technology, although billed as a way to lower prices, has had the effect also of greatly increasing society\u2019s exposure not only to hackers but also to \u2018shock events\u2019 that disrupt entire systems,\u201d the Open Markets Institute, a Washington think tank that advocates for controls on market concentration, wrote in its weekly newsletter on Jan. 11. For now, Intel\u2019s big problem is Krzanich\u2019s stock sales, but if it becomes clear that customers have been harmed by hacking or higher costs, regulators will likely seek recourse through consumer protection suits, antitrust investigations, or both.  Intel has faced this kind of public pressure before. In 1994 the company was heavily criticized for trying to ignore evidence that its Pentium chips were generating errors for certain obscure calculations. The crisis caused IBM to announce that it would no longer ship machines that used the flawed chips. Intel\u2019s meticulously constructed brand, Intel Inside, which had served as a sort of Good Housekeeping Seal for computer buyers, suddenly looked questionable. As part of Intel\u2019s extensive mea culpa, then-CEO Andy Grove offered to replace all the buggy chips and took an inventory writedown of $475 million, about half its annual R&D budget at the time.  Grove\u2019s lesson, as he recounted in his business-advice book Only the Paranoid Survive, was that Intel had been caught out. Even a quarter-century into its existence, the massive company still saw itself as a scrappy tech startup. With its size and influence, he acknowledged, came new responsibilities. \u201cThe trouble was,\u201d Grove wrote, \u201cnot only didn\u2019t we realize that the rules had changed, but what was worse, we didn\u2019t know what rules we now had to abide by.\u201d  Intel has been the top chipmaker for the past 25 years, but Meltdown and Spectre could turn out to be much worse than the Pentium bug. If the company wants to maintain its position, it\u2019ll need real humility, not cheap theatrics.  \u2014With Dina Bass, Mark Bergen, Alex Webb, and Dune Lawrence", "stock": "INTC", "label": 1, "date": "2018-01-20", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-01-18/intel-has-a-big-problem-it-needs-to-act-like-it"}, {"article": "Deutsche Telekom AG has created a digital glasses startup with manufacturer Carl Zeiss AG, as Europe\u2019s biggest telecoms company joins the race in developing usable augmented reality devices.

The world\u2019s largest online TV network late Monday reported its strongest year of subscriber growth to date. Netflix added 24 million customers in 2017, bringing its global total to 117.6 million. For the final three months of the year, the Los Gatos, California-based company crushed Wall Street estimates and suggested it will continue to do so in 2018.  Media's Biggest Market Caps Netflix heads past $100 billion in market value after a blowout fourth quarter Source: Bloomberg data  While rival media companies merge, fire staff and fret about the future of their businesses, Netflix keeps chugging along, adding customers at home, in Europe and Latin America. Fourth-quarter sales grew by a third to $3.29 billion, the company said, while earnings almost tripled from a year prior to 41 cents, meeting estimates.  Netflix will plow all of that and more into new TV shows and movies. The company has said it will spend as much as $8 billion on programming this year, and disclosed Monday it will shell out another $2 billion for marketing. Netflix is also dramatically increasing its non-English programming, with plans to release 30 local language productions in 2018.  The shares rose as much as 13 percent to $257.71 in New York, marking a new high for the stock, which had already gained 19 percent this year through Monday.  Netflix signed up 8.33 million customers in the fourth quarter, surpassing analysts\u2019 estimates of 6.34 million, thanks in large part to the popularity of the fantasy series \u201cStranger Things\u201d and the new Will Smith movie \u201cBright.\u201d  That success has inspired Facebook Inc., Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. to try their hand at original programming. It has also spurred rivals like Walt Disney Co. to invest more in online services and acquire competitors. Yet Netflix enjoys a head start on all those players.  International Gains  International territories accounted for the bulk of the subscriber growth and hold the key to Netflix\u2019s future, with additions of 6.36 million topping the 5.05 million average of analysts\u2019 estimates. Netflix said Rodolphe Belmer, the chief executive officer of Paris-based Eutelsat Communications SA, will join its board.  The U.S. business, where growth had been slowing, also showed vigor. The company signed up 1.98 million new customers at home, up from a year ago and beating analysts\u2019 projections of 1.29 million, according to Bloomberg data.  Netflix churns out a wide range of new shows every month to entice new viewers and keep old ones. In the latest quarter it also released \u201cThe Crown,\u201d the first season of David Fincher\u2019s \u201cMindhunter\u201d and its first original German series, \u201cDark.\u201d  \u201cIn only five years since launching our first original series, Netflix had three of the top five most searched TV shows globally for the second year in a row,\u201d the company said in its letter to shareholders.  Netflix expects to add 6.35 million customers in the first quarter, more than the average 5.18 million projection of analysts. That includes 1.45 million new subscribers in the U.S.  Quarterly Profit  Splurging on new shows comes at a cost. Netflix will burn through as much as $4 billion in cash this year and said it will borrow again. Critical analysts continue to wonder when spending will level off. The company has stayed around break even for most of its existence, but continues to need cash because of lavish spending on programming.  Long-term debt stood at $6.5 billion at year-end, while long-term content liabilities totaled $3.33 billion.  The ability to raise prices could boost Netflix\u2019s profitability in the long-term. The company\u2019s October price increase -- $1 a month for the most popular plan -- had little impact, if any, on growth in the quarter.

It\u2019s also a boy\u2019s club. An episode about home cooking is the only one with an equal representation of women and men among the significant speaking roles. In all the others men outnumber women by 2 or 3 to 1; in the pizza episode it\u2019s 8 to 1. This may reflect the state of affairs in the food industry, but it\u2019s surprising for a series that wants to talk about diversity and representation.  (African-American chefs and commentators are even less present, appearing almost exclusively in an episode about the coded meanings and cultural signifiers of fried chicken.)  The show often allows Mr. Chang\u2019s rough edges to show, and sometimes its picture of him is unflattering in ways that don\u2019t seem intentional. His jibes can cross over into meanness, and his pontifications can appear oblivious, as when he compares the art of barbecue to the art of jazz in an episode focused entirely on white and Asian cooks.  \u201cI don\u2019t know how the hell it all happened,\u201d Mr. Chang says, contemplating the franchise that he has become. The claim seems unlikely, and one way to see the show, with its focus on pizza and tacos and dumplings, is as a branding exercise \u2014 a pivot away from high-intensity cooking toward the ugly deliciousness of comfort food. The penultimate episode ends with him holding a plate of kimchi and Spam fried rice toward the camera. In the Chang vernacular, it looks bonkers, and you\u2019ll want to crush it.", "stock": "NFLX", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-23", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/23/arts/television/ugly-delicious-review-david-chang-netflix.html"}, {"article": "So you sketch out what\u2019s next for Season 2, then what happens?  Going into Season 2, we knew we wanted to end with Lydia having the stroke and that the final episode would be an homage to the \u201cMaud\u201d episode that he and I both love. It\u2019s where everyone gets to do a monologue. So along the way, we knew we wanted to build in some of the stroke stuff. We knew we wanted to have Penelope in a relationship and for it to amicably \u2014 over something like having children \u2014 end. That just felt like something a lot of women I know who are nearing 40 are experiencing.  Same with Elena. We knew we wanted her to have a girlfriend and to start this positive relationship with her. We knew we wanted to make a baby step with Victor [Penelope\u2019s ex-husband and the children\u2019s father, played by James Martinez]. It\u2019s not a complete resolution, but something that seemed hopeful. We came in with those things, sat with the writers, and they tell us what\u2019s going on in their lives and what\u2019s been important. We find a middle ground and break the stories, and that\u2019s that.  The country\u2019s politics have changed since the premiere of Season 1. How did you decide to incorporate that into the show \u2014 like the episode when Alex gets called an ethnic slur?  That was based on a real incident. That happened to my brother at a beach in San Diego. We\u2019ve lived in San Diego for 20 years. He called me up post-Trump, \u201cI was just at the beach, and someone told me to go back to Mexico!\u201d He was laughing about it because he doesn\u2019t care. But it\u2019s like, \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d We try on the show to show many points of view. Obviously, the show has a liberal bent, but we try to show all sides of an issue so all sides of the conversation can start. This is something we thought would affect this family, so how would they talk about it? What would that look like?  Do you worry whether any of the characters might become unrelatable as you\u2019re preparing for the next season?

My mom had a stroke and didn\u2019t tell me for 12 years! That\u2019s real! I was just talking with her and she said, \u201cAye, when I had a stroke \u2026 \u201d \u201cWait, what stroke?\u201d \u201cAh, your wedding was happening, I didn\u2019t want to bother you.\u201d \u201cOye, mom, you better tell somebody!\u201d All that is real. It seems dramatic, but in a wonderful way in the arms of Rita Moreno, it has that diva turn.  A colleague of mine has written about how the show has this wonderful sense of joy. It feels like a celebration of Cuban culture, Latino identity, the immigrant experience and family. Is that a conscious choice when writing?  Well, that\u2019s just my experience. Really, my house is not a sad place ever. We feel so blessed, we feel so grateful. We have a really good time. In the media, Latino families are always in crisis \u2014 there\u2019s gang violence, people weeping. That\u2019s just not what I know it to be. I wanted to reflect my experience, too, and to throw that in the ring. It seems a lot of people relate to that, too.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Last season, you addressed immigration with Elena\u2019s friend Carmen and her parents\u2019 deportation. This time, you have Lydia and Schneider (Todd Grinnell) going through the citizenship process. Was that something you wanted to keep exploring?  In my family, not all of the Cubans became citizens. My parents became citizens, but I have aunts and uncles who did not. When you become a U.S. citizen, you have to renounce your Cuban citizenship. They\u2019re green card holders \u2014 they pay taxes, social security and they can\u2019t vote. When Trump started deporting people, my cousins got really concerned. \u201cShould we have mom become a citizen?\u201d There was all this worry. What if Lydia had never become a citizen? Then it would be fun to have her and Schneider go on that journey together.  Another story line you kept exploring this season was Penelope\u2019s depression, and how she\u2019s still struggling with the social stigma and the need to rely on antidepressants to help her.  We really wanted to get that right. It also seemed like something veterans really struggle with; Latinos have a lot of issues with discussing it or going on medications. We wanted to explore what that was like for this character. Also, she\u2019s at a great point in her life, so it\u2019s that placebo of \u201cEverything is going great, and I don\u2019t need to do any of this stuff anymore.\u201d Then, we saw what the reality of that looked like for her. She couldn\u2019t talk to her mom about it, and she couldn\u2019t talk to her boyfriend about it because she was embarrassed. It was also a way to deepen her relationship with Schneider because he was the only person she could talk to about it.  Is there a story you\u2019re looking forward to continuing in Season 3?  Well, we have a few things built in already. Penelope is in school, so she still will be in school, or maybe graduate. We get to see her journey to being a nurse practitioner. Seeing what else is out there for her dating life as well. Deepening Elena\u2019s relationship. Maybe Alex will get to have a little love in his life. And of course, we\u2019ll be taking into consideration what's happening in the next month or two months from now.

Here are 11 great movies and TV shows leaving Netflix in April.  Tom Hanks in \u201cApollo 13.\u201d Universal Pictures  \u2018Apollo 13\u2019  Leaving Netflix: April 1  April 1 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  There\u2019s no greater testament to the skill and craft of this 1995 smash from Ron Howard than the fact that he manages to build (and sustain, for two-plus hours) tension and suspense around an event with a widely known outcome. That event is the Apollo 13 lunar mission in 1970, intended to be the third manned landing on the moon but aborted after a mechanical failure that put the lives of its three astronauts in jeopardy. Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon and Bill Paxton project credible professionalism in those roles, finding the proper, fleeting moments to let their understandable fear and frustration blast through; an Oscar-nominated Ed Harris is brilliant as the flight director on the ground, marshaling the minds tasked with bringing their boys home.  \u2014  Michael Keaton, left, and Jack Nicholson in \u201cBatman.\u201d Warner Bros., via Everett Collection  \u2018Batman\u2019 / \u2018Batman Returns\u2019  Leaving Netflix: April 1  Once upon a time, a big-budget, big-screen adaptation of a popular comic book was actually a big deal. But the attraction to Tim Burton\u2019s 1989 \u201cBatman\u201d wasn\u2019t just its subject, but its style: The Gothically-inclined Burton (\u201cBatman\u201d was released between \u201cBeetlejuice\u201d and \u201cEdward Scissorhands\u201d) followed the lead of the graphic novels by Frank Miller, eschewing the fizzy, cartoon-pop sensibility of the \u201960s television series (and its film spinoff) and crafting a decidedly darker take on the Dark Knight, casting Michael Keaton against type in the title role opposite a riveting (and scenery-chewing) Jack Nicholson as the Joker. It was so successful, Burton was given more even freedom on its 1992 follow-up, which takes Gotham into grimmer territory thanks to Danny DeVito\u2019s freakish take on the Penguin and Michelle Pfeiffer\u2019s sizzling turn as Catwoman.  \u2014  A scene from \u201cCaddyshack.\u201d Warner Bros.  \u2018Caddyshack\u2019  Leaving Netflix: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  One of the most quotable comedies of the modern era (\u201cCinderella story,\u201d \u201cBe the ball,\u201d \u201cSo I got that goin\u2019 for me, which is nice\u201d), this 1980 favorite from director Harold Ramis (\u201cGroundhog Day\u201d) often feels like channel surfing between several movies at once: a W.C. Fields-style personality comedy starring Rodney Dangerfield; a wiseguy, post-\u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 vehicle for Chevy Chase; a slapstick farce starring Bill Murray; and an earnest coming-of-age comedy-drama featuring Michael O\u2019Keefe. But the inconsistency and incongruity somehow mesh, due in part to the picture\u2019s spirit of cheerful, slobs-vs.-snobs anarchy, resulting in something akin to a coked-up Marx Brothers movie.  \u2014  A scene from \u201cCool Runnings.\u201d Buena Vista Pictures  \u2018Cool Runnings\u2019  Leaving Netflix: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  One of the highlights of the 1988 Winter Olympics (from a storytelling perspective, if not a sporting one) was the debut of the Jamaican national bobsled team, which quickly became a fan favorite for their clear discomfort with an event not exactly common to their tropical home. But it soon became a feel-good underdog story of teamwork in the face of adversity \u2014 in other words, ideal fodder for a big-screen dramatization by Disney. And what could have been a one-joke physical comedy play instead became a warmhearted \u201990s classic, thanks to the energetic direction by Jon Turteltaub (\u201cNational Treasure\u201d) and the charismatic turns by Doug E. Doug, Leon, Malik Yoba, and Rawle D. Lewis as the team members, and (in one of his final performances) the great John Candy as their coach.  \u2014  0  John Mulaney on \u201cJohn Mulaney: New in Town.\u201d Comedy Central  \u2018John Mulaney: New in Town\u2019  Leaving Netflix: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  This 2012 special from John Mulaney, the former \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d writer and stand-up comic extraordinaire, which originally aired on Comedy Central, was only his second such showcase, but he already showed an old-timer\u2019s mastery of the form. His deceptively simple persona, of a meek but good-hearted soul doing his very best to navigate a complicated world, proves durable and reliable as he explores dating, doctor\u2019s visits and basic social interactions. The show\u2019s funniest (if somewhat specialized) bit, however, may be his lengthy rumination on the pleasures of \u201cLaw & Order: Special Victims Unit\u201d and its resident skeptic, Ice-T.  \u2014  Alex Bailey/Fox Searchlight Pictures  \u2018Never Let Me Go\u2019  Leaving Netflix: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Kazuo Ishiguro\u2019s 2005 dystopian romance novel gets the big-screen treatment in this 2010 drama from director Mark Romanek (\u201cOne Hour Photo\u201d). Keira Knightley, Carey Mulligan and Andrew Garfield star as three students and occasional romantic partners who discover, in their teens, that all of them are clones \u2014 born and raised for the eventual harvesting of their organs. Screenwriter Alex Garland displays the thoughtful, chamber-music approach to science fiction of his subsequent \u201cEx Machina\u201d and \u201cAnnihilation\u201d (both of which he directed). Romanek, meanwhile, pulls off the neat trick of creating a cold, sterile world that is nonetheless infected by warmth and humanity \u2014 attributable in no small part to the skillful work of his crackerjack cast.  \u2014  Morgan Freeman in \u201cThe Shawshank Redemption.\u201d Columbia Pictures, via Everett Collection  \u2018The Shawshank Redemption\u2019  Leaving Netflix: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Removing this 1994 prison drama from Netflix probably won\u2019t dent its ubiquity \u2014 it\u2019s a regular topper of IMDb\u2019s Top 250 list and it seems to pop up on TNT or TBS on a near-weekly basis. But it still smarts not to have this cinematic comfort food a mouse-click away, as it features the quintessential Morgan Freeman performance (wise, calm, and narrating for clarity) and some of Tim Robbins\u2019 most complicated work (as a man who says little and reveals even less). Frank Darabont\u2019s patient filmmaking, in which a series of seemingly casual vignettes crescendo into an emotionally overwhelming climax, makes this a particularly re-watchable film, in which little throwaways and asides take on extra meaning upon second (and third, and tenth) viewings.  \u2014  David Bowie in \u201cThe Prestige.\u201d Touchstone Pictures  \u2018The Prestige\u2019  Leaving Netflix: April 21  April 21 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Between his first and second cracks at Batman, director Christopher Nolan slid in this twisty, stylish exercise in sleight-of-hand moviemaking, as if to assure the fans of his breakthrough movie \u201cMemento\u201d that he was still up to his old tricks. This time around, the term \u201ctricks\u201d is literal: In \u201cThe Prestige,\u201d Nolan tells the story of two stage magicians in 1890s London, whose friendly rivalry first becomes fraught, then deadly. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale scheme and connive appropriately in the leading roles; a standout supporting cast includes Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall and David Bowie.  \u2014  Banksy in a scene from \u201cExit Through the Gift Shop.\u201d Paranoid Pictures  \u2018Exit Through the Gift Shop\u2019  Leaving Netflix: April 22  April 22 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  The enigmatic and eccentric street artist Banksy directs this Oscar-nominated 2010 documentary, in which he profiles the rise of Thierry Guetta, known by the street-art name \u201cMister Brainwash.\u201d Frisky and funny, it casts a cynical insider\u2019s eye on the art world, as well as on Banksy\u2019s place inside it \u2014 particularly in retrospect because of rumors that Guetta was, in fact, a creation of Banksy\u2019s and that the entire story is a made-up prank. The director (who never reveals his face in the film) has denied the rumors, but they lend an extra dimension to this film, in which everything (and perhaps everyone) could be a bluff.  \u2014  Mark Ruffalo and Keira Knightley in \u201cBegin Again.\u201d Andrew Schwartz/Weinstein Company  \u2018Begin Again\u2019  Leaving Netflix: April 27  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  The Irish writer and director John Carney revisited his microbudget, Oscar-winning indie sensation \u201cOnce\u201d with a well-financed, star-cast exploration of the same themes: the magnificence of pop music, the semi-romantic charge of collaboration and the power of a song to say what can\u2019t be put into words alone. Keira Knightley is charming (and believable) as a songwriter who finds an unexpected champion in a burned-out record executive (Mark Ruffalo). The musical numbers are stirring, and the dramatic beats land, but its best scene is its simplest: its two protagonists, wandering through New York City with their headphones, playing each other their favorite songs. Sweet but not saccharine, it is full of tiny moments of truth.  \u2014", "stock": "NFLX", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-22", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/22/watching/leaving-netflix-movies-april.html"}, {"article": "Matters that seem arcane are often vitally important, because they can be worth tens of billions of dollars. Such is the case with \u201crisk adjustment\u201d in health care. Medical spending is not spread evenly across all people in society. Half the population uses hardly any care in a given year\u2014only 3% of total spending. Conversely, 10% of Americans consume about two-thirds of all health-care spending.  Consequently, when someone buys an ObamaCare plan or enrolls in a Medicare Advantage managed-care plan, the federal government needs to adjust the fixed premium (or subsidy) it pays to account for how sick the person is. Patients who have serious conditions come with bigger government payments. Without this adjustment, insurers and health-care providers would have a strong incentive to care only for healthy people.  Photo: istock/getty images  While the concept sounds simple, risk adjustment is among the factors that make health care so maddeningly complicated. For an \u201caverage patient\u201d in Erie County, N.Y., the government will pay a private insurer offering a Medicare Advantage plan roughly $9,500 a year. But for a patient with lung cancer, diabetes with complications, depression and macular degeneration, risk adjustment triples the amount to just over $27,000 a year.  That large difference is intended to ensure that the sick patient can continue to get care. But consider the incentives it sets up. As every physician knows, many diseases are diagnosed and their severity assessed based on clinical judgment as opposed to objective criteria. Others may be under control or no longer relevant and aptly characterized as \u201cpast medical history.\u201d Finally, many conditions emerge in almost everyone with age.  Risk adjustment gives doctors and Medicare Advantage insurers a financial reason to ignore these nuances. Instead they have incentives to find every possible diagnosis\u2014and then to make the patient\u2019s conditions sound as severe as possible\u2014so as to raise government payments the most.  This gaming is pervasive enough to have a name: up-coding. In 2016 the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services audited 37 Medicare Advantage health plans. Thirty-five had overcharged the government, commonly by overstating the severity of diabetes and depression. A 2016 study from the Government Accountability Office suggests this practice costs taxpayers billions of dollars a year in overpayments.  Because Medicare cannot police every plan, it has attacked the problem with a sledgehammer, enacting an annual \u201ccoding intensity adjustment,\u201d which in 2018 will reduce premiums by \u201cat least 5.91%.\u201d But this adjustment, which insurers aggressively lobby to minimize, penalizes honest Medicare Advantage plans, too. Ultimately, it does not solve the problem because insurers build the \u201cpenalty\u201d into their premiums.  Up-coding also diverts providers and insurers from finding ways to improve care and reduce costs. This effect is reinforced by the Affordable Care Act\u2019s \u201cmedical loss ratio\u201d rules, which require insurers to spend at least 85% of premiums on clinical care. The only way to increase profits, then, is to raise revenues while keeping administrative costs the same. Gaming risk adjustment is an easy way to do that.  Doctors find risk adjustment incredibly frustrating. Medicare Advantage plans torment them with reminders to do annual visits, in the guise of \u201cwellness visits,\u201d to code every disease in every patient. A whole industry of opportunistic intermediaries like Inovalon, hired by health-insurance companies, support up-coding by retrieving patient charts, mining them for abnormal lab values or prescriptions indicative of diseases that aren\u2019t being billed, and then faxing back \u201csuggestions\u201d for added diagnoses. This distracts doctors, provides no value for patients, and sucks tons of money out of the system.  How to clean up this mess? Begin by acknowledging that current methods of risk adjustment are not very good. On average, the factors used by Medicare today\u2014mainly data from past claims\u2014can account for only about 36% of the true variation in patient spending due to disease. That means lots of extra money is flowing for diagnoses that do not necessarily imply the assumed increased costs.  One way for Medicare to do better would be to emulate Netflix . Beginning in 2006, Netflix ran a world-wide contest to improve Cinematch, its proprietary algorithm for predicting how users would rate films they\u2019d never seen. The grand prize was $1 million. Within a year, over 2,000 separate teams from 150 countries had submitted more than 13,000 algorithms. Eventually, the winning team, which included researchers from AT&T Labs, Yahoo and an Austrian consulting firm, improved the algorithm by more than 10%. For a tiny cost, Netflix got a huge amount of computer-science research that even its highly skilled employees could not perform.  Medicare should do the same: create a contest open to anyone in the world who can beat its current risk-adjustment model. To ensure fairness and encourage competition, administering it should be outsourced to the X Prize Foundation or a similar group. The winner should be able to use objective patient data to account for at least 45% of the spending variation caused by disease. Medicare could award a $10 million grand prize and several million for second and third place. It also should be required to adopt one of the top methods. (There may be practical reasons not to pick the winner.)

While Donald Trump\u2019s broadsides this week against what he deemed unfair trade practices focused on industrial metals, comments he made over the past couple of months about the tech industry indicate it could soon come in for targeting as well. In January, Trump said the U.S. was considering a fine on China because it had forced U.S. companies to share their intellectual property as a cost of doing business there. Then in his first State of the Union address, Trump pledged \u201cstrong enforcement\u201d of U.S. rules that protect business secrets.  Those warnings are now sounding more ominous to investors concerned about a trade war between the world\u2019s two biggest economies.  Chris Krueger, an analyst at Cowen Washington Research, notes that semiconductors are one of six \u201ccore industries\u201d in Trump\u2019s America First agenda, along with steel, aluminum, vehicles, aircraft and shipbuilding. He said a U.S. Trade Representative report on forced technology transfers by China may come in a matter of weeks, way before the official Aug. 18 deadline, and could recommend tariffs or bans on Chinese investment or joint ventures.  If Trump does decide to crack down on intellectual property theft, U.S.-based semiconductor companies that have Chinese customers or factories in China could get caught in the crossfire. China is the largest market for the chip industry and if it were to retaliate some U.S. companies may suffer.  \u201cReciprocity on the part of China in IP crackdowns could have a substantial effect on manufacturing and IP of companies,\u201d said Matt Larson, a Bloomberg Intelligence litigation analyst.  One sector high-flier with significant China exposure, Nvidia Corp., had been up 25 percent year-to-date. It sold off as much as 5.7 percent yesterday after Trump made his steel tariff comments, and is dropped as far as 4.5 percent today before recovering. The move over the past two days is worse than the broader market selloff of about 2 percent, reflecting the concern about a Trump tech crackdown.

Goldman Sachs and Citron Research both announced a pullback on their optimism while maintaining a good overall outlook.  Watch Nvidia trade in real time here.    Nvidia's short-term future is looking bleak.  The stock is down 1.52% to $236.84 after Goldman Sachs removed Nvidia from its conviction list, and Citron said the stock is about to drop about 15% to $200.  The two firms are both concerned about how red-hot Nvidia shares have been recently. Shares have been on a meteoric tear over the last year, gaining 104.31%, as revenues grew just 11%. In 2018, stock has posted a 16.74% gain, which Citron thinks is too much.  \"Is Nvidia really worth $36 billion more than it was New Years Eve with $15k BTC?\" Citron asked on Twitter. Nvidia has gotten a boost from cryptocurrency miners buying huge numbers of graphics cards to speed up their rigs, especially as the price of bitcoin hit its high of nearly $20,000 in December. Prices have come crashing down to just under $9,000, which could mean demand from miners could wane.  Citron and Goldman both fear the boost Nvidia has seen from cryptocurrency mining is unsustainable and unreliable as a way to grow sales. Goldman said it could lead to volatile earnings as Wall Street struggles to find concrete ways to predict the demand of the crypto market.  For context, during its recent earnings call, AMD's leadership said crypto mining added about $300 million in revenue, or about 5-6%, in 2017. Nvidia is set to report its earnings, and its boost from crypto mining, on February 8.  Crypto isn't the only worry for Nvidia, though.  The company's data center business was just starting when Goldman added the stock to its conviction list in late 2016. Since then, it's exploded as artificial intelligence and cloud computing have become the hottest new trend in enterprise computing. The sector is now better understood, which means more players are starting to nip at the heels of Nvidia's dominance, according to Citron.  Citron said that Nvidia used to be the only player in AI and autonomous driving computing, but is facing stiff competition in both categories going into 2018.  While both Goldman and Citron criticize the company and predict a more difficult 2018, the firms agree that Nvidia is still at the top of its game. Goldman maintained its buy rating on the company, and Citron said it still loves the company's CEO, Nesen Huang. 2018 may just be a slower year for the company.

Morgan Stanley, Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. were among at least 10 banks that helped to make the so-called margin loan, which is guaranteed only by Softbank\u2019s Alibaba holding, said the people, who requested anonymity as the details aren\u2019t public. The deal won\u2019t be reflected in the Tokyo-based company\u2019s debt, which may help shield it from a ratings downgrade, and could help its plans to sell shares in a domestic subsidiary, the people said.  The participation of the world\u2019s biggest banks in the trade reflects their continued appetite for complex share-based trades linked to their most-prized clients even after banks lost more than $1 billion combined on a margin loan linked to Steinhoff International Holdings NV. The South African retailer has lost more than 90 percent of its market value following disclosures of accounting errors that dated back several years.  \u201cTo my knowledge, I would agree that $8 billion is the largest margin loan ever,\u201d said Bethany Knight, a former Deutsche Bank executive who now advises on equity derivatives at Riverside Risk Advisors LLC in New York. \u201cThere are only a handful of sizable margin loans due to the significant ownership stake needed in a large, liquid, public company.\u201d  SoftBank couldn\u2019t immediately be reached for comment. Shares in Alibaba fell 2.2 percent to $168.86 at 12.25 p.m. in New York.  BNP Paribas SA, Deutsche Bank AG, Nomura Holdings Inc., Societe Generale SA, UBS Group AG and ING Groep NV were among other lenders on the deal, the people said. Representatives for the banks either declined to comment or didn\u2019t return calls and emails.  The margin loan\u2019s interest rate is the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, plus about 150 basis points, or 1.5 percent, two of the people said. Softbank sold $2 billion of 10-year bonds last year that had a yield of 5.7 percent in London.  The margin loan may also remove an obstacle to the initial public offering of its domestic telecommunications unit SoftBank Corp., which had been used as collateral for its earlier debt, one of the people said. A successful IPO -- possible only after the division proves its independence by canceling debt guarantees -- could help the parent raise capital and relieve some of its debt burden, which reached 15.8 trillion yen ($147 billion) at the end of last year. A Tokyo listing could raise more than 2 trillion yen, people with knowledge of the matter said this year.  Masayoshi Son Photographer: Akio Kon/Bloomberg  Billionaire founder Masayoshi Son, who has said he aims for a listing within a year, is seeking to separate SoftBank\u2019s activities into investing and telecommunications arms as it branches out into businesses ranging from ride-hailing to insurance.  SoftBank Group\u2019s debt risk last month jumped to the highest in almost two years following a successful exchange of its dollar- and euro-denominated bonds for new securities, allowing the mobile-phone unit to release its loan guarantee. That swap eases the way for the IPO, prompting concern among bondholders that the unit\u2019s listing may reduce the amount of cash flow for the parent company.  In a margin loan, a borrower secures the debt by pledging an asset with the understanding that they\u2019d need to pay up if the value of the collateral declines. The lender can typically sell some of the collateral if the borrower is unable to provide the cash.

Singaporean state investment firm Temasek Holdings Pte wants to be the lead investor ahead of a highly anticipated initial public offering, one of the people said.  If the deal goes ahead, Ant would be the world\u2019s largest fintech company and the biggest startup. The company, in which Alibaba plans to acquire a one-third stake, controls the country\u2019s premier mobile payments service and money market fund, and has moved deeper into areas from consumer lending to credit scoring.

Ant\u2019s however had a string of recent setbacks, with its U.S. expansion thwarted by the collapse of a deal for MoneyGram International Inc., while its Chinese business faces scrutiny from regulators and increased competition from Tencent Holdings Ltd., the social media behemoth that runs WeChat.

Shoppers in China largely accept Alibaba\u2019s voracious data collection, which allows the company to create detailed behavioral profiles across its many platforms.

CDRs are expected to trade in yuan, potentially creating an arbitrage opportunity with the dollar-denominated American Depositary Receipts or Hong Kong dollar-denominated shares they will be based on. Beijing is still in discussion with regulators, bourses and bankers on the issue.  Different trading mechanisms also present other issues. China has a 10 percent daily trading limit, up or down, on mainland stocks, which most expect would apply to CDRs.  \"If Alibaba rises or falls more than 10 percent in the US in an extreme situation, but in China, existing rules cap its move,\" said Wu Beihong, an investor who buys stocks in both China and overseas. \"How do you solve this issue?\"  Another question is how much tech champions would be expected to list at home, and how those shares would be sold.  If China's biggest four internet groups - Tencent, Alibaba, Baidu and JD.com - were to sell 5 percent of their existing shares in the mainland, that would drain $55 billion from the market, equivalent to a fifth of all the funds raised in the onshore market in 2017, according to UBS analysts.  That could hit the pipeline of mainland IPO candidates hard - or prompt a sell-off in smaller shares if investors wanted to raise cash for the returning giants.  The sales might also prove difficult to execute. Last month, Naspers, the one-third owner of Tencent, sold a 2 percent stake in the tech giant, raising $9.8 billion in Asia's largest-ever block sale and dwarfing any single sale in the mainland.  \"Do Shanghai or Shenzhen have the expertise to sell $10 billion in Tencent or Alibaba?\" asked one Hong Kong official who requested anonymity. \"That is a big ask.\"  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  The irony of potentially selling and trading shares in China based on offshore listings of Chinese companies domiciled outside the mainland - which they have to be to list overseas - is not lost on investors and bankers.

Soon after Sports Illustrated published a report detailing those allegations, Richardson, 82, said he would sell the team.  Certain N.F.L. owners have already started to make their preferences known. Many owners have said that, all bids being equal, they prefer Tepper because he already owns a stake in the Steelers, which he would have to sell if he bought the Panthers, and because he has the financial wherewithal, with a net worth of roughly $11 billion.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Rubin, who teamed up on his bid with Joe Tsai, the co-founder of the Alibaba Group, is also known to N.F.L. owners because Fanatics is the official retail partner of team merchandise.  While both Tepper and Rubin appear willing to continue bidding for the team, neither are prepared to pay $2.5 billion, according to several people with knowledge of the auction, though they could be posturing.  Representatives for Tepper, Rubin, Kestenbaum and Navarro all declined to comment.  At the meetings here, three owners who declined to be identified because they did not want to be seen injecting themselves into the process, said that Navarro\u2019s holdings in companies that lend to subprime borrowers might be a stumbling block for them.  Navarro\u2019s company, Sherman Financial Group, has stakes in financial services companies around the world, but 90 percent of the revenue and income comes from Credit One Bank, which issues credit cards to credit-challenged customers. Credit One has been sued for using aggressive collection techniques.  Among other things, Sherman Financial also buys and manages consumer debt. Sherman Financial also paid a $175,000 penalty to settle a case brought by New York attorney general Eric Scheiderman for unlawful debt collection.  Additionally, Sherman Financial also owns about half of a joint venture with the Chedraui family in Mexico that provides similar lending services. The company, Consupago, offers loans that are among the most expensive in Mexico to a captive market of government employees.  On Sunday, Bob McNair, the owner of the Houston Texans, voiced support for Navarro. He cited his philanthropic giving and said he had no issue with his line of work. \u201cHis business is a legitimate business,\u201d McNair told reporters. \u201cFor me, that wouldn\u2019t be a problem.\u201d", "stock": "BABA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-27", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/27/sports/nfl-panthers-sale.html"}, {"article": "BEIJING\u2014The iQiyi Inc. video-streaming unit of search-engine giant Baidu Inc. BIDU -1.37% has filed for an initial public offering in the U.S., promoting its ability to use artificial intelligence and user data to deliver videos that generate billions of views.  In a U.S. regulatory filing, Baidu said it would list iQiyi on the Nasdaq exchange and is seeking to raise around $1.5 billion. Analysts at Jefferies have valued iQiyi at $17 billion.  The move comes as Baidu looks to raise money for the loss-making unit to stay ahead in the fiercely competitive video-streaming sector where tech titans Tencent Holdings Ltd. TCEHY -3.15% and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA -2.21% also have strong plays. Baidu told investors in its most recent earnings call that it would remain iQiyi\u2019s controlling shareholder.  IQiyi, which was founded in 2010 and will list under the ticker IQ, said it is China\u2019s largest video-streaming service by amount of time spent watching, with more than 50 million paid subscribers.  Two of its original series, \u201cThe Mystic Nine\u201d and \u201cBurning Ice,\u201d have together garnered more than 13 billion views, the company said in its filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  \u201cWe distinguish ourselves in the online entertainment industry by our leading technology platform powered by advanced AI, big data analytics and other core proprietary technologies,\u201d the company said in its filing. \u201cOur core proprietary technologies are critical to producing content that caters to user tastes, delivering superior entertainment experience to our users.\u201d  In China, people spend the majority of their online-entertainment time on video, and the market overall is expected to grow to 688 billion yuan ($109 billion) by 2022, up from about 51 billion yuan in 2012, iQiyi said, citing a report by iResearch Consulting Group.  But a tough competitive environment and the costs of providing content have made streaming a money-losing proposition for Baidu, as well as for its internet rivals Tencent and Alibaba.  \u201cWe incurred net losses since our inception,\u201d iQiyi said in its filing, including losses of 3.7 billion yuan in 2017.  Junwen Woo, a senior analyst at IHS Markit who tracks online video in Asia, said iQiyi has potential because of its use of AI, which helps the company differentiate from competing Chinese video platforms operated by much bigger rivals Alibaba and Tencent.  \u201cThey can know what is the most popular content and what are the most favorite things viewers like\u2014and what is coming up next,\u201d she said.  In fundraising last year, iQiyi raised $1.53 billion, an investment that came months after investors balked at a $2.3 billion buyout bid from a group led by Baidu Chief Executive Robin Li, saying the proposal undervalued the unit.  Goldman Sachs , Credit Suisse and Bank of America Merrill Lynch are the lead underwriters of the IPO.  \u2014Wayne Ma in Hong Kong contributed to this article.
