[{"article": "Netflix  While some investors may be wary about Netflix's estimated billions-of-dollars in spending on new and original content, one Wall Street analyst believes Netflix can back it up with its brand.  Viewers often have positive feelings about Netflix movies and TV shows even before they've seen them, which should help the streaming giant keep a healthy pace in subscriber growth, Bernstein analyst Todd Juenger says.  Watch Netflix's stock move in real time here.  When video watchers hear Netflix is behind a movie or TV show, they most often conclude that it has to be good, or at least worth the minimal investment of time to check it out.  That positive association with Netflix's brand could be hard for competitors to beat, and could help justify its estimated $12 billion investment in original content.  \"The positive brand association Netflix has created among its members provides a positive halo for its content, giving Netflix a huge advantage because members are pre-disposed to think they will 'like' Netflix content, which usually becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy,\" wrote Todd Juenger, a Bernstein analyst.  With some of its recent successes, such as \"Bright,\" featuring Will Smith, the German production \"Dark,\" and the Oscar award-winning documentary, \"Icarus,\" Netflix has proven that it produces original content that will keep driving new and loyal subscribers back to its platform.  This is also helping the video streaming company draw some key Hollywood talent such as Ryan Murphy, the man behind \"American Horror Story\" and \"Glee,\" and Shonda Rhimes, the producer behind such hits as \"Grey's Anatomy\" and \"Scandal.\" The fact that Netflix is able to pull such high-profile names also keeps them away from competitors, Juenger notes.  \"While the price tag is high, the value of a 'hit show' for Netflix is also high, and it's nice to have your $12 billion in capable hands,\" Juenger said.  Netflix plans to spend billions of dollars on roughly 700 new original TV shows in 2018 as part of its strategy to build \"a global moat\" that would widen its competitive advantage, according to another Wall Street analyst.  In fact, investor confidence was so high for Netflix that a Stifel analyst downgraded the stock, claiming the \"share price may have sprinted ahead of fundamentals in the short-term.\"  Netflix was up 3.78% on Friday at $328.84 per share. It was up 63.62% for the year.

It\u2019s hard to imagine Mr. Rock releasing a club set after hardly any time to refine it, the way Mr. Chappelle did over New Year\u2019s. Mr. Rock is too much of a perfectionist. And while Mr. Chappelle shows up at clubs and spends hours onstage riffing, gathering ideas through free association, Mr. Rock\u2019s process is much more focused and linear, like his comedy.

Whereas Mr. Chappelle escapes tricky territory through sweeping history lessons or literary flourishes, Mr. Rock builds forceful arguments that culminate in precise and memorable epigrams. \u201cPressure makes diamonds, not hugs\u201d is the pithiest defense of bullying you will hear.  Mr. Rock\u2019s booming act has always been built for bigger rooms, but he goes smaller for this special, with the help of the comic Bo Burnham, whose artfully idiosyncratic direction emphasizes intimacy and studiously avoids clich\u00e9. The show begins with a casual shot of the back of Mr. Rock\u2019s head while he is chatting backstage and ends abruptly. When the star drops the microphone, Mr. Burnham fades to black before we hear the familiar sound of it hitting the floor. Crisp images of the front row of the theater, juxtaposed with smoky backdrops and ghostly lighting, make the audience appear on the same level as the performer, creating unusually striking images for stand-up comedy.  In filming just the first joke \u2014 \u201cYou would think that cops would occasionally shoot a white kid, just to make it look good\u201d \u2014 Mr. Burnham shifts angles four times, but he also knows when to stop moving the camera. As Mr. Rock confesses he cheated on his wife, he goes in for the close-up and lingers.  This risks heavy-handedness but displays a perceptive eye for the importance of a pivot point where the star could lose his audience. Kevin Hart, who recently confessed to cheating on his wife before announcing a tour called \u201cIrresponsible,\u201d might face a similar onstage moment soon.  When I saw Mr. Rock play Madison Square Garden in December, he took a few glancing shots at Matt Lauer, the \u201cToday\u201d host who was fired over allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior, but the comic mostly avoided #MeToo as he does in the new special. Though Mr. Rock evoked the movement at one point by shifting from his mistakes with his wife to a broader question: \u201cWhat is wrong with men?\u201d  Over the course of his career, mixing the voice of a preacher with that of a litigator, Mr. Rock has built up an authority skewering the foibles of the world while keeping his own offstage. This special represents a shift in that dynamic. In describing his flaws, Mr. Rock says he was hooked on pornography. There is a lot of comedy about pornography, but to hear a superstar break down how watching it made him \u201csexually autistic\u201d is bracing, and may even provide grist to certain warnings against online porn.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  In that North Carolina show, Mr. Rock went into more detail about his affairs. That was cut from the special, leaving nothing to invite jealousy. His tone is contrite, but it also suggests he has recovered, both from porn addiction and cheating, which he says he\u2019s done with. In an hour dense with jokes, he gets serious. \u201cWhen guys cheat, we want something new,\u201d he says, still in close-up. \u201cBut you know what happens? Your woman finds out and now she\u2019s new. She\u2019s never the same again. You got new but you got a bad new.\u201d  Offstage, Chris Rock is soft-spoken, thoughtful, even shy \u2014 an alter ego to the strutting superhero he becomes in his stand-up specials whose titles (\u201cBigger & Blacker,\u201d \u201cNever Scared\u201d) telegraph swagger. In the age of Trump, he has shifted to something quieter, more humble, and yet, with the same old confidence, with lessons learned at the end.

In this 2003 film, Zellweger plays a tomboyish woman in the beautiful mountains of rural North Carolina who goes to live with a lonely neighbor (Nicole Kidman) who\u2019s waiting for her husband (Jude Law) to come back from the Civil War. Their characters become close friends and rely on each other for survival, which becomes a wonderful (nonromantic) relationship to watch.  \u2014  A scene from \u201cThe Iron Giant.\u201d Warner Bros.  \u2018The Iron Giant\u2019  Starts streaming: April 1  April 1 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Although the robotic star of this movie makes a big cameo in Steven Spielberg\u2019s \u201cReady Player One,\u201d his role in a fight scene in that film presents a sharp contrast with how audiences first met the gentle Iron Giant in 1999. In the original animated film, a boy named Hogarth finds the large robot from outer space during the paranoia-filled age of the Cold War. He is forced to keep his new best friend a secret even though the giant comes in peace. Unloved at the box office during its first run, \u201cThe Iron Giant\u201d later gained a devoted following and helped get its director, Brad Bird, into Pixar Studios, where he went on to make \u201cThe Incredibles.\u201d  \u2014  From left, Roberto Benigni, Giorgio Cantarini and Nicoletta Braschi in \u201cLife Is Beautiful.\u201d Sergio Strizzi/Miramax Films  \u2018Life Is Beautiful\u2019  Starts streaming: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  In this three-time Oscar-winner (one of which resulted in this moment), a Jewish Italian father tries to protect his young son from the horrors of a concentration camp after they are captured by Nazis. Roberto Benigni starred in, wrote and directed the movie, which uses slapstick comedy to balance some of the film\u2019s tragic scenes.  \u2014  0  Corey Feldman, left, and Corey Haim in \u201cThe Lost Boys.\u201d Warner Bros.  \u2018The Lost Boys\u2019  Starts streaming: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Before Joel Schumacher became known as the director behind two of the worst \u201cBatman\u201d sequels (\u201cBatman: Forever\u201d and \u201cBatman & Robin\u201d), he made this thrilling horror-comedy about a group of troublemaking vampires who roam a California boardwalk, seducing victims and squaring off against a group of comic-book nerds. It is delightfully \u201980s in every respect: the hair, the clothes, the kinds of mischief the kids get up to. And then there\u2019s the cast, which includes \u201980s stars like Corey Feldman, Corey Haim, Alex Winter, Dianne Wiest and Kiefer Sutherland, as the leader of the vampire pack.  \u2014  Michelle Pfeiffer and Al Pacino in \u201cScarface.\u201d Universal Pictures, via Everett Collection  \u2018Scarface\u2019  Starts streaming: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  This is the Brian De Palma movie that launched a handful of catchphrases, many bad Al Pacino impressions and countless movie posters on dorm rooms across the country. Written by Oliver Stone, the film follows the ruthless Cuban gangster Tony Montana as he climbs his way up from being a low-level hood to ruling a slice of the Miami drug scene in the decadent \u201980s. In his perverted sense of the American dream, nothing is off limits. It\u2019s a mentality that eventually leads to so many scenes of violence and drug use that it makes \u201cMiami Vice\u201d look like a kid\u2019s show.  \u2014  Netflix Original TV Series  A scene from \u201cChef\u2019s Table: Pastry.\u201d Martin Westlake/Netflix  \u2018Chef\u2019s Table: Pastry\u2019  Starts streaming: April 13  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  TV\u2019s prettiest-looking cooking series gets its second spinoff, focused on four of the world\u2019s most acclaimed dessert-makers: the Milk Bar\u2019s Christina Tosi, Room 4\u2019s Will Goldfarb, El Celler de Can Roca\u2019s Jordi Roca and Caff\u00e8 Sicilia\u2019s Corrado Assenza. As always, expect the director-producer David Gelb and his crew to combine these chefs\u2019 philosophical ruminations with drool-worthy images of food.  \u2014  Parker Posey in \u201cLost in Space.\u201d Netflix  \u2018Lost in Space\u2019 Season 1  Starts streaming: April 13  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Although it only ran for three seasons in the 1960s, the family-friendly science-fiction series \u201cLost in Space\u201d has maintained a steady presence in popular culture, thanks largely to its memorable characters and endearingly wonky science. Netflix\u2019s new remake appears to be keeping most of what worked the first time out, albeit with updated special effects and a more modern outlook on gender roles. The comically dour Dr. Smith, for example \u2014 played by Jonathan Harris in the original \u2014 is a woman in this version, and she\u2019s played by a cleverly cast Parker Posey.  \u2014  Robert F. Kennedy in his apartment in New York City in 1966. via Netflix  \u2018Bobby Kennedy for President\u2019  Starts streaming: April 27  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  President John F. Kennedy\u2019s life, career and death have been covered extensively in documentaries, movie dramas, and TV mini-series, much more than his brother Robert\u2019s political career and assassination. The four-hour docu-series \u201cBobby Kennedy for President\u201d is an effort to correct that imbalance, using the landmark cultural moment of Kennedy\u2019s 1968 White House run \u2014 and its abrupt, tragic end \u2014 as a lens through which to observe what he stood for and what he meant to a generation of young idealists.  \u2014  Also of interest: \u201cThe Boss Baby: Back in Business\u201d Season 1 (April 6), \u201cThe Magic School Bus Rides Again\u201d Season 2 (April 13), \u201cThe Chalet\u201d Season 1 (April 17), \u201cDope\u201d Season 2 (April 20).  New Netflix Original Movies  Dave Franco and Abbi Jacobson in \u201c6 Balloons.\u201d Netflix  \u20186 Balloons\u2019  Starts streaming: April 6  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  The accomplished young comic actors Abbi Jacobson and Dave Franco play against type in the writer-director Marja-Lewis Ryan\u2019s \u201c6 Balloons,\u201d an edgy drama about the stress of dealing with a loved one who\u2019s hooked on drugs. Franco is a heroin addict suffering through a relapse and Jacobson is the hyper-organized, strait-laced sister who spends one long, tense day trying to get him the help he needs while also making sure that his life isn\u2019t totally upended \u2014 two goals that aren\u2019t necessarily compatible.  \u2014  Chiwetel Ejiofor in \u201cCome Sunday.\u201d Tina Rowden/Netflix  \u2018Come Sunday\u2019  Starts streaming: April 13  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Chiwetel Ejiofor gives one of the best performances of his long, accomplished career in \u201cCome Sunday,\u201d playing the real-life evangelical minister Carlton Pearson, who around the turn of the millennium began preaching \u201cthe Gospel of Inclusion,\u201d arguing that Jesus Christ had saved everyone regardless of a person\u2019s religious beliefs. Directed by Joshua Marston and written by Marcus Hinchey, the film is intended as a bracing challenge to fervent Christian believers, asking them to consider the true purpose of their faith.  \u2014  From left, Ed Harris, Elizabeth Olsen and Jason Sudeikis in \u201cKodachrome.\u201d Christos Kalohoridis/Netflix  \u2018Kodachrome\u2019  Starts streaming: April 20  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Based on a true story, the indie dramedy \u201cKodachrome\u201d stars Ed Harris as a cranky, ill old man who takes a road trip with his compassionate nurse (Elizabeth Olsen) and his estranged son (Jason Sudeikis), in order to drop off some undeveloped rolls of film at the last lab in the country that can process them. Similarities to the recent Oscar nominee \u201cNebraska\u201d are unmistakable, but this move has its own tone and rhythm, paying off in some satisfyingly emotional moments.  \u2014  0  A scene from \u201cMercury 13.\u201d via Netflix  \u2018Mercury 13\u2019  Starts streaming: April 20  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  In 1960, not long after NASA publicly announced the names of the seven pilots who became the first American men in space \u2014 the so-called Mercury Seven \u2014 a private organization started recruiting women to undergo some of the same psychological and physical tests administered to those men. The purpose: to see if the challenges of flying beyond Earth\u2019s atmosphere differed by gender. The documentary \u201cMercury 13\u201d is a look into this lesser-known project, considering the way the codified sexism of the post-World War II era denied a one-of-a-kind opportunity to some would-be (and perfectly capable) adventurers.  \u2014  Chris Rock, left, and Adam Sandler in \u201cThe Week Of.\u201d Netflix  \u2018The Week Of\u2019  Sarts streaming: April 27  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  For the most part, the movies that Adam Sandler has delivered to Netflix as part of his recent four-picture deal have been embarrassingly broad. But there\u2019s reason to hope that this last film in the batch will be the best \u2014 in part because it is directed by the incisive veteran comic Robert Smigel (who also wrote the film with Sandler), and in part because it also stars Sandler\u2019s old \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d castmate Chris Rock. Sandler and Rock play parents who spend an anxious seven days leading up to their kids\u2019 wedding. Rachel Dratch and Steve Buscemi also star, in a film that could potentially hearken to more emotionally complex Sandler projects like \u201cThe Wedding Singer.\u201d  \u2014  Also of interest: \u201cThe 4th Company\u201d (April 6), \u201cAmateur\u201d (April 6), \u201cOrbiter 9\u201d (April 6), \u201cPickpockets\u201d (April 12), \u201cDude\u201d (April 20), \u201cPsychokinesis\u201d (April 25) and \u201cCandy Jar\u201d (April 27).  New to Amazon Prime Video  Kurt Russell in \u201cEscape From New York.\u201d Avco Embassy Pictures  \u2018Escape From New York\u2019  Starts streaming: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell) is a man of action and few words. In the not-too-distant future (1997 \u2014 the film was released in 1981), Air Force One crash lands in the prison colony of Manhattan, and Plissken is enlisted to rescue the president before the crooks who kidnapped him seek revenge. Along with \u201cThe Thing,\u201d this is one of the best 1980s collaborations between Russell and the movie\u2019s director, John Carpenter. Between Russell\u2019s gruff macho-man character, exaggerated villains and dystopian view of New York City, this movie is pretty out there. Breaking up all the seriousness, the classic-movie star Ernest Borgnine shows up for comic relief as an old-school cabdriver looking to help Plissken with his mission.  \u2014  Robert De Niro in \u201cThe King of Comedy.\u201d 20th Century Fox  \u2018The King of Comedy\u2019  Starts streaming: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  In his mind, Rupert Pupkin (Robert De Niro) is a TV star, and he\u2019ll do just about anything to make his dream come true \u2014 including stalking and kidnapping. This is perhaps one of Martin Scorsese\u2019s more understated movies. It doesn\u2019t have the same amount of violence that movies like \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d or \u201cGoodfellas\u201d have. It\u2019s a psychological drama that is tense and sometimes tragically funny.  \u2014  Michelle Pfeiffer and Alec Baldwin in \u201cMarried to the Mob.\u201d MGM  \u2018Married to the Mob\u2019  Starts streaming: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Angela de Marco (Michelle Pfeiffer) has a husband in the mafia (a young and dashing Alec Baldwin), and she wants out. Unfortunately, leaving the mob is harder than breaking a marriage, and Angela is left to defend for herself from gangsters and the feds. The premise sounds bleak, but \u201cMarried to the Mob\u201d is a lively Jonathan Demme romantic comedy that gives Pfeiffer a chance to play for laughs. It\u2019s funny but poignant, bubbly but still dark at times \u2014 all in equal measure so nothing is out of whack.  \u2014  A scene from \u201cParanormal Activity.\u201d Paramount Pictures  \u2018Paranormal Activity\u2019  Starts streaming: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  This is the low-budget found-footage horror film that helped kick off a craze in the late 2000s. Suspecting there\u2019s something strange lurking in their new home, a young couple sets up stationary cameras to capture whatever might be creeping around at night. But the cause of the disturbances is more terrifying than they anticipated. For best results, watch this movie at night, right before you go to bed.  \u2014  Sally Field, left, and Julia Roberts in \u201cSteel Magnolias.\u201d TriStar Pictures  \u2018Steel Magnolias\u2019  Starts streaming: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  This is both a great mother-daughter movie and a good one to watch with girlfriends. \u201cSteel Magnolias\u201d is about a group of women in the South and the many highs and lows of their collective experiences. The central story follows a hard-to-please mother (Sally Field) and her diabetic daughter (Julia Roberts), who despite her fragile health still wants kids. Field and Roberts are amazing, but there isn\u2019t a bad performer in a cast that includes Shirley MacLaine, Daryl Hannah, Olympia Dukakis and Dolly Parton in one of her best onscreen roles.  \u2014  Chavela Vargas as seen in \u201cChavela.\u201d Music Box Films  \u2018Chavela\u2019  Starts streaming: April 2  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  For those not familiar with the Mexican musician Chavela Vargas, let this inspiring documentary be your guide. She was a pants-wearing pioneer in an era when Mexican women didn\u2019t sing ranchera music onstage without wearing super frilly dresses. But Vargas ditched the costume, picked up a guitar and sang haunting songs of longing and loss. This documentary goes to great lengths to explain the mysterious Vargas through old interviews and recordings, but it can sometimes feel as if she\u2019s just out of reach. She\u2019s keeping some secrets to herself.  \u2014  0  From left, Christopher Rivera, Brooklynn Prince and Valeria Cotto in \u201cThe Florida Project.\u201d A24  \u2018The Florida Project\u2019  Starts streaming: April 6  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Sean Baker made a splash at Sundance a few years ago with \u201cTangerine,\u201d a sun-drenched, foul-mouthed comedy starring two transgender actresses and shot with an iPhone. His follow-up, \u201cThe Florida Project,\u201d is no less daring. Set amid a string of pastel-colored roadside motels in Orlando, Fla., just outside the Happiest Place on Earth, the movie follows a precocious 6-year-old troublemaker named Moonee (Brooklynn Prince) as she and her friends wreak havoc and her quick-tempered mother (Bria Vinaite) tries to keep up with the rent. Willem Dafoe gives a career-best performance as their motel\u2019s beleaguered manager, who becomes a kind of surrogate father to Moonee.  \u2014  Also of interest: \u201cBasic Instinct\u201d (April 1), \u201cCarrie\u201d (April 1), \u201cFor a Few Dollars More\u201d (April 1), \u201cFriday the 13th\u201d (April 1), \u201cThe Karate Kid\u201d (April 1), \u201cMarathon Man\u201d (April 1), \u201cMystic River\u201d (April 1), \u201cPhiladelphia\u201d (April 1), \u201cProject Nim\u201d (April 1) and \u201cSpaceballs\u201d (April 1).  New to Hulu  Nicolas Cage in \u201cCon Air.\u201d Touchstone Pictures  \u2018Con Air\u2019  Starts streaming: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  It is difficult to pick the movie with the best Nicolas Cage reaction shots, but this bombastic Jerry Bruckheimer movie from 1997 is near the top. In it, Cage plays a convict and former soldier who is on his way out of jail when the plane he is on gets hijacked by his fellow inmates. Of course, it wouldn\u2019t be a \u201990s Cage action movie without lots of fighting, over-the-top explosions and some pithy one-liners.  \u2014  Meryl Streep in \u201cDeath Becomes Her.\u201d Mary Evans/Universal Pictures, via Everett Collection  \u2018Death Becomes Her\u2019  Starts streaming: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Meryl Streep is at her funniest in this little black comedy about jealousy and magic. In it, Streep plays Madeline, a gorgeous movie star who steals the handsome fianc\u00e9 (Bruce Willis) of the much plainer Helen (Goldie Hawn), thus setting a disastrous course for both women. Their jealousy drives them to dark magic, which has some interesting physical side effects. \u201cDeath Becomes Her\u201d has a lighthearted, macabre sense of humor, full of morbid slapstick stunts and neck-twisting pratfalls. But it is also a bittersweet comedy about female friendships and impossible beauty standards.  \u2014  From left, Omar Sharif and Peter O\u2019Toole in \u201cLawrence of Arabia.\u201d Columbia Pictures  \u2018Lawrence of Arabia\u2019  Starts streaming: April 1  April 1 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  This 1962 war epic from director David Lean is on a lot of \u201cbest movies\u201d lists \u2014 and with good reason. The film is among the best of its genre, with its sweeping views of windswept battlegrounds and its penetrating look into the ways that war drives men mad. It\u2019s the story of T.E. Lawrence, who during World War I goes from being an insubordinate officer to a troubled leader. \u201cLawrence of Arabia\u201d is celebrated for Lean\u2019s stunning direction, for Maurice Jarre\u2019s unforgettable score, for Anne V. Coates\u2019s brilliant editing and for its remarkable cast, which includes Peter O\u2019Toole, Omar Sharif, Alec Guinness and Claude Raines. Don\u2019t let the three-and-a-half-hour run time scare you off. Just put the movie on the biggest screen you can find, and make enough popcorn to get you to the intermission.  \u2014  Sarah Polley in \u201cStories We Tell.\u201d Roadside Attractions  \u2018Stories We Tell\u2019  Starts streaming: April 1  April 1 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Although it is classified as a documentary, this deeply personal film from Sarah Polley almost feels like a work of fiction.

Thus truly began a long-promised deluge of what the kids call \u201ccontent,\u201d and just how much original content Netflix will put up before the year is over is something not even Netflix can say.  The influx of original programs coincides with news reports about Netflix\u2019s thorny relationship with cinema. The Cannes Film Festival, making good on a pledge last year, has codified its ban on Netflix-produced films in its competition. (If it\u2019s a Netflix movie, it will not screen in competition.) This is because of what Cannes regards as Netflix\u2019s intransigence about showing its films in theaters. Add to that a recent interview with the director Steven Spielberg in which he said that films produced by Netflix and other streaming platforms ought not to be eligible for Oscar consideration but compete for the Emmy Awards instead. That brings the immortal question \u201cWhat Is Cinema?\u201d to the forefront yet again. Along with it are the debates over the ostensibly sacrosanct value of the Communal Theatrical Experience.  It\u2019s not this column\u2019s job to provide definitive answers to the questions these debates raise.

Mr. Jones is known for the films \u201cMoon\u201d (2009), a well-received original, and \u201cWarcraft\u201d (2016), a video game adaptation that confused critics who thought it a little cheesy relative to Mr. Duncan\u2019s previous projects.

It\u2019s a peculiar grab bag of ideas and visual modes, and Mr. Jones has said it was influenced by his impressions of Berlin during his childhood, when he spent time there with his father, David Bowie, in the \u201970s. The movie is dedicated to Bowie and to Marion Skene, Mr. Jones\u2019s childhood nanny.

Last season we shot in the winter, and it got darker in many ways. And now in Season 5, even more than in 4, it\u2019s very much more serialized and intense, while still obviously maintaining comedy first. It goes deeper than we ever have in the friendship.  Amy Poehler is an executive producer of the show. And until this coming season, so was her manager, Dave Becky, who has been criticized for ignoring sexual misconduct allegations against his client Louis C.K.  It just didn\u2019t feel right to have his name on a show that represents the exact opposite of what was going on with Louis.  Do you have your own #MeToo moment?  I don\u2019t have a major story particularly to tell, but there are so many stories within my story. The world of comedy is definitely a boys\u2019 club.

But it is a kind of alternative TV dimension, overlaying and replicating the known world of traditional television, that tries to acquire one of everything that exists in the universe of TV.  Initially, the company did this through literal acquisition: buying streaming rights to hit TV series. Then it did it through imitation: reviving Fox\u2019s \u201cArrested Development\u201d and creating originals, like \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d in the mold of premium cable. Now it\u2019s imitating through acquisition, spiriting away the likes of Mr. Murphy and Ms. Rhimes to its well-remunerated plane.  The history of TV is one of upstarts and competitors, and my first instinct was to liken Netflix to something like cable, which rose as a serious competitor to broadcast TV in the 1980s.  But there\u2019s an important difference between cable channels and Netflix (besides whom you write your check to). Cable channels have brands. That was what made them different from broadcast networks, which tried to be, and had to be, everything. Cable channels had specialties and sensibilities: CNN was news; ESPN was sports; HBO was adult sophistication (give or take an \u201cEntourage\u201d).  Photo  A cable brand might evolve \u2014 Bravo went from an arts channel to the \u201cReal Housewives\u201d channel \u2014 but the idea was to offer a specific aesthetic to a specific audience.  Netflix doesn\u2019t have that; in fact, it is specifically anti-that. Its brand is \u201cstuff that you like to watch on TV.\u201d It developed a vast library of reruns, and with that, a proprietary trove of data on who likes to watch what and how much. Then it made more of that, or bought it. If you liked \u201c30 Rock,\u201d here\u2019s \u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.\u201d If you liked \u201cDamages,\u201d here\u2019s \u201cBloodline.\u201d  Look at just the past few months of Netflix programming. There\u2019s \u201cThe Crown,\u201d a BBC-style historical drama. \u201cWormwood,\u201d an Errol Morris docudrama. \u201cOne Day at a Time,\u201d a 21st-century reboot of a 1970s network TV multicamera sitcom. \u201cDirty Money,\u201d a \u201cFrontline\u201d-esque documentary anthology. \u201cShe\u2019s Gotta Have It,\u201d a risqu\u00e9 romantic comedy. \u201cMy Next Guest Needs No Introduction,\u201d a David Letterman interview series.

The obvious analogy, then, is that Netflix isn\u2019t cable at all; it\u2019s a broadcaster, pitching a big tent.  But, as I\u2019ve written before, there\u2019s one very important difference. Broadcasters, whose advertising model required millions of eyeballs on every individual show, had to make sure that everything they aired appealed to a broad range of people.  That business imperative had aesthetic results: It gave us family sitcoms and comfort-food cop dramas. It\u2019s less true today, in the era of smaller audiences \u2014 but it\u2019s still much more true of NBC than, say, of IFC.

It\u2019s selling a platform to everyone, but by providing products for very specific tastes.  Netflix assumes a future in which we\u2019re watching our faves on our own screens, rather than gathering around an electronic fireplace \u2014 and as long as the monthly payment clears, it\u2019s all the same to the company. It\u2019s less a big tent than a Dothraki tent city, to borrow a metaphor from \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d  What does this mean for Ryan Murphy and Shonda Rhimes? Maybe not much at all. They were both powerful producers with a lot of freedom who will now have a lot of freedom and more money.  Photo  Mr. Murphy was, in a way, the Netflix-iest of producers to begin with: He\u2019d made everything from a broadcast network sitcom (\u201cThe New Normal\u201d) to an action show (\u201c9-1-1\u201d) to a marquee cable drama (\u201cFeud\u201d) to an HBO film (\u201cThe Normal Heart\u201d). He may be able to branch out even more, but he was hardly fettered.  What Ms. Rhimes does at Netflix will be interesting. She\u2019s the consummate network TV producer, having essentially defined the current voice of ABC with \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d and \u201cScandal.\u201d  She might do something very different with the license of streaming \u2014 but if she doesn\u2019t, that will fit in all the same at Netflix, which resurrected the broadcast favorite \u201cGilmore Girls\u201d with much the same tone, give or take a few curse words. One curious thing about Netflix is that every sensibility \u2014 niche and mass, G-rated and NSFW \u2014 exists on the same platform and the same plane.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Is all the deal-making worth it? Whether Netflix is emptying its deep pockets wisely by making itself into a Hall of Fame for established stars (see also Dave Chappelle) isn\u2019t my concern as a TV critic.  What I do care about is whether Netflix can nurture original, distinctive art, especially if it continues growing into a huge, all-encompassing alterna-TV.  And I worry whether it can do that when derivation is the business strategy itself: selling people new versions of things they already like. It\u2019s fine that Netflix can toss around enough money to reactivate David Letterman. But does it have the kind of culture that could discover a new David Letterman?  In its short life as an original programmer. Netflix has made a few series I\u2019d consider legitimately great. But most of them have involved making deals with creators with limited track records (\u201cBoJack Horseman,\u201d \u201cAmerican Vandal\u201d) or talented artists relatively new to creating series (\u201cMaster of None,\u201d \u201cLady Dynamite\u201d). (As I\u2019ve also written before, these shows tend to be comedies, which may translate more directly and easily to the streaming format.)  A more familiar experience on Netflix is the good-enough version of a drama you\u2019ve seen elsewhere. \u201cGodless,\u201d say, was a perfectly decent dark western, but no \u201cDeadwood.\u201d \u201cStranger Things\u201d is a joy, but it\u2019s a pastiche by design: It\u2019s the Netflix ethos in story form, reproducing and remixing memories in ways that tickle just the right nostalgia pleasure centers.  It may be that Netflix\u2019s approach means more competence and fewer out-and-out stinkers. And I have no reason to believe that Mr. Murphy and Ms. Rhimes will become any less creative because Netflix backed up a money truck.  But if Netflix is truly becoming a parallel TV universe, I hope its algorithm finds room for the experimental and untried.

The restaurant visits and chef interviews are broken up with fake commercials, animations, film clips and parodies of Japanese TV comedies or the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d Julia-Child-bleeds-out skit. The season finale is structured as a debate between Mr. Chang and the chef Mario Carbone over the relative merits of Italian filled pastas and Asian dumplings.  These techniques, and a generous Netflix budget, are on display in the pizza episode, which was filmed in Brooklyn, Tokyo, New Haven, Copenhagen, Naples, Los Angeles and Las Vegas. Demonstrating his trademark contrarianism, Mr. Chang praises Domino\u2019s \u2014 even donning the company vest and delivering pies \u2014 and declares New Haven and then Tokyo as the homes of the world\u2019s best pizza.

What the show is really selling is the Chang attitude and mystique, a combination of ego, exactitude, foul-mouthed rebelliousness and self-deprecatory nerdiness.

An important part of Mr. Chang\u2019s persona at the start was his outsider status, casting stones at (or at least making withering remarks about) the bastions of haute cuisine where he had learned his trade. That became problematic as he built an international restaurant empire that recently added the 200-plus-seat Momofuku Las Vegas.  And in \u201cUgly Delicious\u201d he moves with a band of insiders that includes Mr. Meehan, the superstar Danish chef Ren\u00e9 Redzepi and Mr. Ansari, Mr. Chang\u2019s fellow Netflix star. It\u2019s also a boy\u2019s club. An episode about home cooking is the only one with an equal representation of women and men among the significant speaking roles. In all the others men outnumber women by 2 or 3 to 1; in the pizza episode it\u2019s 8 to 1. This may reflect the state of affairs in the food industry, but it\u2019s surprising for a series that wants to talk about diversity and representation.  (African-American chefs and commentators are even less present, appearing almost exclusively in an episode about the coded meanings and cultural signifiers of fried chicken.)  The show often allows Mr. Chang\u2019s rough edges to show, and sometimes its picture of him is unflattering in ways that don\u2019t seem intentional. His jibes can cross over into meanness, and his pontifications can appear oblivious, as when he compares the art of barbecue to the art of jazz in an episode focused entirely on white and Asian cooks.  \u201cI don\u2019t know how the hell it all happened,\u201d Mr. Chang says, contemplating the franchise that he has become. The claim seems unlikely, and one way to see the show, with its focus on pizza and tacos and dumplings, is as a branding exercise \u2014 a pivot away from high-intensity cooking toward the ugly deliciousness of comfort food. The penultimate episode ends with him holding a plate of kimchi and Spam fried rice toward the camera. In the Chang vernacular, it looks bonkers, and you\u2019ll want to crush it.", "stock": "NFLX", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-23", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/23/arts/television/ugly-delicious-review-david-chang-netflix.html"}, {"article": "Watching is The New York Times\u2019s TV and film recommendation website.

Here are 12 great movies and TV shows leaving Netflix in March.  A scene from \u201cJaws.\u201d Universal Pictures  \u2018Jaws\u2019  Leaving Netflix: March 1  : March 1 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  This 1975 horror thriller from Steven Spielberg did nothing less than revolutionize the movie industry \u2014 once studio executives realized exactly how much money could be made by a single summer blockbuster, it changed the way movies were released and advertised. But that\u2019s not the reason to see it (or see it again); it was a hit then, and it has endured for more than four decades because it is a masterfully constructed adventure ride, filled with bruising set pieces, eerily convincing effects, quotable dialogue (they are, in fact, gonna need a bigger boat), and memorable characters. Ultimately, we care about this ragtag crew of would-be shark hunters, which renders their breathless encounters with the great white all them more compelling.  \u2014  Guy Pearce in \u201cMemento.\u201d Danny Rothenberg/Newmarket Films  \u2018Memento\u2019  Leaving Netflix: March 1  : March 1 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Christopher Nolan\u2019s second feature \u2014 and first big hit \u2014 is an expertly constructed windup toy of a movie, spinning an exhilarating 113 minutes out of a fairly simple premise: A man with short-term memory loss (Guy Pearce), tries to solve his wife\u2019s murder. But Nolan augments the storytelling with an appropriate stylistic flourish, presenting it in reverse chronological order, so that in each new scene, the viewer is as uncertain about what\u2019s happening as the protagonist. Replete with neo-noir styling and a cast of top-notch character actors (including Joe Pantoliano, Carrie-Anne Moss, and Stephen Tobolowsky), \u201cMemento\u201d is a deliciously inventive mystery with a potent dose of melancholy right under its surface.  \u2014  Kitty Winn and Al Pacino in \u201cThe Panic in Needle Park.\u201d 20th Century Fox  \u2018The Panic in Needle Park\u2019  Leaving Netflix: March 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Before \u201cSerpico,\u201d before \u201cDog Day Afternoon,\u201d before even \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d Al Pacino made his big-screen breakthrough in this 1971 drug drama from director Jerry Schatzberg (\u201cStreet Smart\u201d). As a heroin addict and street hustler whose nights and days are an endless search for money, drugs or both, Pacino is both scarily convincing and offhandedly charismatic; you get a sense of why his new girlfriend, Helen (Kitty Winn, also terrific), would fall for him, and also why she should stay far away. Joan Didion and John Gregory Dunne\u2019s low-to-the-ground script and Schatzberg\u2019s gritty, neorealist-inspired photography create scenes that feel less written and staged than overheard and captured, resulting in an uncomfortable but powerful viewing experience.  \u2014  Natasha Lyonne in \u201cSlums of Beverly Hills.\u201d Fox Searchlight Pictures  \u2018The Slums of Beverly Hills\u2019  Leaving Netflix: March 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  American comedies don\u2019t deal in matters of class nearly as much as they could (and should), which is part of what makes this 1998 comedy from the writer-director Tamara Jenkins (\u201cThe Savages\u201d) unique, and valuable. Set in 1976, it concerns a lower-income family\u2019s attempts to keep the kids in good schools by dwelling in sketchy apartments right on the edge of Beverly Hills. Alan Arkin is a marvel as the hyper-neurotic patriarch, and David Krumholtz is uproariously funny as the unreasonably confident older son. But the showcase performer is Natasha Lyonne, warm and winning as the teenager daughter in the midst of a poorly-timed sexual awakening.  \u2014  0  A scene from \u201cThe Craft.\u201d Columbia Pictures  \u2018The Craft\u2019  Leaving Netflix: March 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Misfits and weirdos will love this 1996 supernatural thriller-drama, in which a nervous new girl (Robin Tunney) at a Catholic boarding school turns to a trio of outcasts (Neve Campbell, Fairuza Balk and Rachel True) for friendship, and their tight-knit group turns into a witches\u2019 coven. The witty script (by Peter Filardi and director Andrew Fleming) nicely quenches one\u2019s thirst for teenage vengeance, with all the proper parties getting their deserved comeuppance. But it\u2019s not just a gimmick movie; all four protagonists create distinctive characters of genuine depth, lending weight to what could have been a throwaway genre exercise.  \u2014  Eva Mendes and Will Smith in \u201cHitch.\u201d Columbia Pictures  \u2018Hitch\u2019  Leaving Netflix: March 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Between \u201cIndependence Day,\u201d \u201cMen in Black\u201d and \u201cI Am Legend,\u201d Will Smith got so good at saving the world, he rarely got the chance to flex his considerable romantic charm. This 2005 hit filled that niche a bit, casting Smith as a relationship expert and one-on-one date coach whose latest client (a sweet and likable Kevin James) is something of a challenge \u2014 one that arrives just as he meets (and finds himself atypically tongue-tied around) the woman of his own dreams (Eva Mendes). Director Andy Tennant mines plenty of laughs from Smith\u2019s built-in swagger and James\u2019s customary oafishness, and he also has a great time turning those personas inside out. Smith and Mendes generate real chemistry, provoking a genuine rooting interest in the midst of this lightweight romp.  \u2014  Marlon Brando in \u201cThe Chase.\u201d Horizon Pictures  \u2018The Chase\u2019  Leaving Netflix: March 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  A knockout ensemble cast \u2014 including Marlon Brando, Jane Fonda, Robert Redford, Robert Duvall and Angie Dickinson \u2014 assembles for this swampy, boozy, atmospheric thriller, in which a small town is rocked by a prison escape that unlocks their secret affairs, desires and lesser instincts. The pacing is a little punchy and the proceedings are a tad overheated, but it\u2019s worth a watch for the skill of the performers (Brando is particularly strong as a sheriff who\u2019s rapidly approaching the end of his rope) and for the inventive direction of Arthur Penn, whom we see tinkering with some of the thematic and stylistic interests he harvested to greater effect for his next film, \u201cBonnie and Clyde.\u201d  \u2014  Mireille Enos and Joel Kinnaman, right, in \u201cThe Killing.\u201d Chris Large/AMC  \u2018The Killing\u2019 (Seasons 1-2)  Leaving Netflix: March 13  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Normally, the removal of the first two seasons of a mystery serial would be a real bummer. But this four-season crime drama is something of an exception, as the split between Season 2 and Season 3 signaled the end of one story (and the end of an era, changing out all but two of the key cast members, which happened again for the fourth) and the beginning of the next. The first two years of the series, based on the Danish crime show \u201cForbrydelsen,\u201d tell a story about the murder of a Seattle teen in meticulous detail \u2014 each episode covers just 24 hours of the investigation. Taut and disturbing, intricate and moody, \u201cThe Killing\u201d is the kind of meaty crime drama that sticks to your ribs.  \u2014  Clockwise from top left: Cyril Figgis, Krieger, Cheryl, Pam Poovey, Sterling Archer and Ray Gillette in \u201cArcher.\u201d FX  \u2018Archer\u2019 (Seasons 1-7)  Leaving Netflix: March 14  : March 14 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  When it began in 2009, this animated FX comedy from Adam Reed sounded like a one-joke premise, and not exactly a fresh one either: an extended spoof on James Bond-style spy stories, set at a secret intelligence agency during an indeterminate and anachronistic pseudo-Cold War period. And yet it took flight (eight seasons and counting) thanks to the show\u2019s frisky writing, winking self-awareness, willingness to reboot itself entirely (full seasons have reset the narrative as a \u201cMiami Vice\u201d spoof and a private eye yarn), and most of all, the skills of the uproarious voice cast, including the \u201cArrested Development\u201d star Jessica Walters as another unstable mother and the \u201cBob\u2019s Burgers\u201d gem H. Jon Benjamin as the boozing, womanizing title character.  \u2014  From left, Judy Hopps (voiced by Ms. Goodwin) and Nick Wilde (voiced by Jason Bateman) in \u201cZootopia.\u201d Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures  \u2018Zootopia\u2019  Leaving Netflix: March 20  : March 20 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  On the surface, there shouldn\u2019t be anything particularly revelatory about a Disney movie with cuddly talking animals. What\u2019s fresh and fascinating about this 2016 smash Byron Howard and Rich Moore, however, is the way it takes the conventions of those movies and injects them with a subtle dose of social commentary \u2014 without turning preachy or detracting from its surface pleasures. Ginnifer Goodwin is plucky and charming as Judy Hopps, a bunny cop in a utopian city who is drawn into a mysterious case wherein tame animals are reverting to their wilder instincts. Jason Bateman is a marvelous counterpoint as the con-artist fox who leads her into the city\u2019s criminal underworld, creating a buddy cop dynamic that recalls \u201c48 HRS.\u201d as much as \u201cBambi.\u201d  \u2014  From left, Roger Rabbit (voiced by Charles Fleischer) and Bob Hoskins in \u201cWho Framed Roger Rabbit.\u201d Walt Disney Studios  \u2018Who Framed Roger Rabbit\u2019  Leaving Netflix: March 24  : March 24 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  \u201cZootopia\u201d wasn\u2019t Disney\u2019s first tale about crime-solving anthropomorphic mammals in the big city. One of its biggest hits of the 1980s was this clever story about cartoon animals and cynical humans who exist together in 1940s Los Angeles, where the movie star Roger Rabbit is accused of murdering a local tycoon. He hires Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins), a hard-boiled private eye, to clear his name, and they embark on a hilarious investigation of the animated movie industry, with cameo appearances by iconic characters from not only the Disney stable but also those of Warner Brothers, Max Fleischer and Walter Lantz. It\u2019s a treat for movie buffs and cartoon aficionados. It\u2019s also an entertaining potboiler, dipping into the juicy, \u201cChinatown\u201d-like mysteries and scandals of postwar Hollywood.  \u2014  From left: Waris Ahluwalia, Michael Gambon, Anjelica Huston, Noah Taylor, Bud Cort, Bill Murray, Matthew Gray Gubler, Seu Jorge, Jeff Goldblum, Cate Blanchett, Willem DaFoe in \u201cThe Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou.\u201d Phlippe Antonello/Touchstone Pictures  0  \u2018The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou\u2019  Leaving Netflix: March 26  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Bill Murray stars as Steve Zissou, a Jacques Cousteau-style oceanographer and documentarian, in this frisky yet bittersweet comic drama from director Wes Anderson. Working for the first time with Noah Baumbach (\u201cThe Squid and the Whale,\u201d \u201cFrances Ha\u201d) as his co-writer, Anderson indulges in an absurdist streak that meshes nicely with the familial discord and dry wit of his previous pictures. He also marshals one of his most impressive casts to date, which includes Cate Blanchett, Willem Dafoe, Michael Gambon, Jeff Goldblum, Anjelica Huston and Owen Wilson, who is both touching and goofy as Zissou\u2019s estranged son.  \u2014  Interested in getting suggestions on what to watch?

Going into Season 2, we knew we wanted to end with Lydia having the stroke and that the final episode would be an homage to the \u201cMaud\u201d episode that he and I both love. It\u2019s where everyone gets to do a monologue. So along the way, we knew we wanted to build in some of the stroke stuff. We knew we wanted to have Penelope in a relationship and for it to amicably \u2014 over something like having children \u2014 end. That just felt like something a lot of women I know who are nearing 40 are experiencing.  Same with Elena. We knew we wanted her to have a girlfriend and to start this positive relationship with her. We knew we wanted to make a baby step with Victor [Penelope\u2019s ex-husband and the children\u2019s father, played by James Martinez]. It\u2019s not a complete resolution, but something that seemed hopeful. We came in with those things, sat with the writers, and they tell us what\u2019s going on in their lives and what\u2019s been important. We find a middle ground and break the stories, and that\u2019s that.  The country\u2019s politics have changed since the premiere of Season 1. How did you decide to incorporate that into the show \u2014 like the episode when Alex gets called an ethnic slur?  That was based on a real incident. That happened to my brother at a beach in San Diego. We\u2019ve lived in San Diego for 20 years. He called me up post-Trump, \u201cI was just at the beach, and someone told me to go back to Mexico!\u201d He was laughing about it because he doesn\u2019t care. But it\u2019s like, \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d We try on the show to show many points of view. Obviously, the show has a liberal bent, but we try to show all sides of an issue so all sides of the conversation can start. This is something we thought would affect this family, so how would they talk about it? What would that look like?  Do you worry whether any of the characters might become unrelatable as you\u2019re preparing for the next season?

My mom had a stroke and didn\u2019t tell me for 12 years! That\u2019s real! I was just talking with her and she said, \u201cAye, when I had a stroke \u2026 \u201d \u201cWait, what stroke?\u201d \u201cAh, your wedding was happening, I didn\u2019t want to bother you.\u201d \u201cOye, mom, you better tell somebody!\u201d All that is real. It seems dramatic, but in a wonderful way in the arms of Rita Moreno, it has that diva turn.  A colleague of mine has written about how the show has this wonderful sense of joy. It feels like a celebration of Cuban culture, Latino identity, the immigrant experience and family. Is that a conscious choice when writing?  Well, that\u2019s just my experience. Really, my house is not a sad place ever. We feel so blessed, we feel so grateful. We have a really good time. In the media, Latino families are always in crisis \u2014 there\u2019s gang violence, people weeping. That\u2019s just not what I know it to be. I wanted to reflect my experience, too, and to throw that in the ring. It seems a lot of people relate to that, too.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Last season, you addressed immigration with Elena\u2019s friend Carmen and her parents\u2019 deportation. This time, you have Lydia and Schneider (Todd Grinnell) going through the citizenship process. Was that something you wanted to keep exploring?  In my family, not all of the Cubans became citizens. My parents became citizens, but I have aunts and uncles who did not. When you become a U.S. citizen, you have to renounce your Cuban citizenship. They\u2019re green card holders \u2014 they pay taxes, social security and they can\u2019t vote. When Trump started deporting people, my cousins got really concerned. \u201cShould we have mom become a citizen?\u201d There was all this worry. What if Lydia had never become a citizen? Then it would be fun to have her and Schneider go on that journey together.  Another story line you kept exploring this season was Penelope\u2019s depression, and how she\u2019s still struggling with the social stigma and the need to rely on antidepressants to help her.  We really wanted to get that right. It also seemed like something veterans really struggle with; Latinos have a lot of issues with discussing it or going on medications. We wanted to explore what that was like for this character. Also, she\u2019s at a great point in her life, so it\u2019s that placebo of \u201cEverything is going great, and I don\u2019t need to do any of this stuff anymore.\u201d Then, we saw what the reality of that looked like for her. She couldn\u2019t talk to her mom about it, and she couldn\u2019t talk to her boyfriend about it because she was embarrassed. It was also a way to deepen her relationship with Schneider because he was the only person she could talk to about it.  Is there a story you\u2019re looking forward to continuing in Season 3?  Well, we have a few things built in already. Penelope is in school, so she still will be in school, or maybe graduate. We get to see her journey to being a nurse practitioner. Seeing what else is out there for her dating life as well. Deepening Elena\u2019s relationship. Maybe Alex will get to have a little love in his life. And of course, we\u2019ll be taking into consideration what's happening in the next month or two months from now.

Photo  Ted Sarandos, the chief content officer at Netflix, laid down the gauntlet five years ago when he said, \u201cThe goal is to become HBO faster than HBO can become us.\u201d  That statement seemed unlikely, coming from an executive who had only recently begun overseeing original programming at a company better known for tucking DVDs into postage-paid red envelopes.  Jump-cut to the present: Netflix is valued at some $115 billion and has 110.6 million subscribers worldwide. It has shown off its might by signing David Letterman to a deal at reportedly $2 million an episode for his new talk show series, giving Chris Rock a reported $40 million for two standup specials and handing Jerry Seinfeld a reported $100 million for his interview program, \u201cComedians in Cars Drinking Coffee,\u201d and standup shows.  Dana Walden, a co-chief executive of the Fox television group, said Mr. Sarandos\u2019s signing of Ms. Rhimes was the deal that had evinced a deep change in Hollywood.  \u201cWhat Ted did was extremely disruptive and sent a message to the entire talent community: These old deals that seemed incredibly lucrative at the time, there\u2019s a new template in town,\u201d Ms. Walden said. \u201cFor any uber-premium creator, the value has gone up 10 times. And Ryan is a once-in-a-lifetime creator.\u201d  Rick Rosen, the head of TV at the agency WME, said it had become clear that Netflix was now able to outspend the companies that had been around since the early days of the movie business.

While that is no match for Netflix, the company has seen growth in each of the last two quarters.  Apple is the wild card.

With the old Hollywood model disrupted, or perhaps broken, Disney, Fox, CBS, Viacom and Time Warner have moved to gain scale in their efforts to compete against the deep-pocketed upstarts.  Pending governmental approval, Disney will acquire much of 21st Century Fox in a $52.4 billion deal that the two companies reached in December. CBS and Viacom, which were part of the same corporation from 2000 to 2006, are in talks to reunite. And AT&T is working to purchase Time Warner \u2014 a deal that is in jeopardy because of a lawsuit filed by the Justice Department to block it on antitrust grounds.  The mergers and acquisitions taking place in the background are, for now, a destabilizing force in the entertainment industry \u2014 one that likely contributed to Mr. Murphy\u2019s decision to leave old Hollywood for the streaming space.  Photo  \u201cWere the Disney deal to have never happened, I think he would have been close to a new deal with us,\u201d said Ms. Walden, the Fox executive who has worked closely with Mr. Murphy. \u201cIf the Disney move happened a year ago, and the transaction was completed by now and we were part of the Disney Company, I think he would be part of us.\u201d  Mr. Murphy declined to comment for this article.  Disney \u2014 a part-owner of Hulu that is building new streaming services under its chief executive, Robert A. Iger \u2014 has repeatedly cited 21st Century Fox\u2019s ability to create popular programming as one of the main reasons it sought to acquire it from Rupert Murdoch. Disney\u2019s own television studio has not been a reliable supplier.  The day after losing Mr. Murphy to Netflix, John Landgraf, the chief executive of FX, which is part of 21st Century Fox, pointed to his cable network\u2019s long record of producing talent, including Donald Glover (\u201cAtlanta\u201d) and Pamela Adlon (\u201cBetter Things\u201d).  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  \u201cWith more than 20 scripted original series on our schedule or upcoming, FX has a very successful track record of identifying and developing talented writers who have produced award-winning hit shows, and it will continue to do so,\u201d he said.  The money aside, Mr. Murphy may have decided that he had a better chance of creating new shows with minimal interference from above at Netflix, rather than at a Disneyfied version of 21st Century Fox. Referring to Disney\u2019s agreement to acquire much of the company at a news media event last month, the producer said: \u201cWhen this deal first went down, I got a call from the Murdochs and I got a call from Mr. Iger. And I said point-blank, you know, the stuff that I do is not specifically Disney, and I\u2019m interested in that and I\u2019m concerned about that.\u201d  The Murphy deal is a distillation of what may prove to be a once-in-a-generation Hollywood moment. He was looking for security at a time when the old-line companies had yet to take the expanded form they are likely to assume in the next year \u2014 and when the streaming services are spending in manic style.  And it helps that Mr. Murphy has become a Netflix obsessive in his own right.  \u201cAll Ryan has watched for the last year has been Netflix,\u201d said Ms. Walden, who is the godmother to Mr. Murphy\u2019s children. \u201cHe loves their Y.A. series, he loves their documentaries, he watched \u2018The OA\u2019 and loved it, he loved \u201813 Reasons Why,\u2019 he admires the brand, the programming. It was the right timing and right company for him.\u201d  The question now is: How long will the streaming companies continue to spend in a George Streinbrenner-like fashion for talent? Last month, Netflix told investors that it had generated a net income of more than $559 million in 2017, but said its free cash flow was negative $2 billion \u2014 a figure that could balloon to $4 billion this year, the company said.", "stock": "NFLX", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-15", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/14/business/media/streaming-wars-ryan-murphy.html"}, {"article": "\u201cIt\u2019s such a beautiful thing that you don\u2019t have to waste,\u201d he said of the oft-discarded end of the cheese block.

But when I cut open that avocado, he looked over in this childlike wonder and was actually amazed.\u201d  He lamented that negativity was a natural response to a program that elevates ordinary people to \u201chero\u201d status. \u201cI think that\u2019s why the show is doing so well,\u201d he said, noting that \u201cQueer Eye\u201d is available to stream in 190 countries. \u201cIt\u2019s about kindness, and we haven\u2019t seen that in a really long time.\u201d  Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Of the Moment The lifestyle newsletter from the Styles, Travel and Food sections, offering the latest trends to news you can use.

Netflix threatens to move the movie business onto our television screens and laptops. Film attendance in the United States is at its lowest level in 23 years. Only the occasional superhero makes real money.  But don\u2019t tell that to the intrepid programmers of New York, who somehow keep the city\u2019s multiplexes, art houses, archives, film societies and cultural centers awash in festivals and specialty series.

Tom Hanks in \u201cApollo 13.\u201d Universal Pictures  \u2018Apollo 13\u2019  Leaving Netflix: April 1  April 1 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  There\u2019s no greater testament to the skill and craft of this 1995 smash from Ron Howard than the fact that he manages to build (and sustain, for two-plus hours) tension and suspense around an event with a widely known outcome. That event is the Apollo 13 lunar mission in 1970, intended to be the third manned landing on the moon but aborted after a mechanical failure that put the lives of its three astronauts in jeopardy. Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon and Bill Paxton project credible professionalism in those roles, finding the proper, fleeting moments to let their understandable fear and frustration blast through; an Oscar-nominated Ed Harris is brilliant as the flight director on the ground, marshaling the minds tasked with bringing their boys home.  \u2014  Michael Keaton, left, and Jack Nicholson in \u201cBatman.\u201d Warner Bros., via Everett Collection  \u2018Batman\u2019 / \u2018Batman Returns\u2019  Leaving Netflix: April 1  Once upon a time, a big-budget, big-screen adaptation of a popular comic book was actually a big deal. But the attraction to Tim Burton\u2019s 1989 \u201cBatman\u201d wasn\u2019t just its subject, but its style: The Gothically-inclined Burton (\u201cBatman\u201d was released between \u201cBeetlejuice\u201d and \u201cEdward Scissorhands\u201d) followed the lead of the graphic novels by Frank Miller, eschewing the fizzy, cartoon-pop sensibility of the \u201960s television series (and its film spinoff) and crafting a decidedly darker take on the Dark Knight, casting Michael Keaton against type in the title role opposite a riveting (and scenery-chewing) Jack Nicholson as the Joker. It was so successful, Burton was given more even freedom on its 1992 follow-up, which takes Gotham into grimmer territory thanks to Danny DeVito\u2019s freakish take on the Penguin and Michelle Pfeiffer\u2019s sizzling turn as Catwoman.  \u2014  A scene from \u201cCaddyshack.\u201d Warner Bros.  \u2018Caddyshack\u2019  Leaving Netflix: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  One of the most quotable comedies of the modern era (\u201cCinderella story,\u201d \u201cBe the ball,\u201d \u201cSo I got that goin\u2019 for me, which is nice\u201d), this 1980 favorite from director Harold Ramis (\u201cGroundhog Day\u201d) often feels like channel surfing between several movies at once: a W.C. Fields-style personality comedy starring Rodney Dangerfield; a wiseguy, post-\u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 vehicle for Chevy Chase; a slapstick farce starring Bill Murray; and an earnest coming-of-age comedy-drama featuring Michael O\u2019Keefe. But the inconsistency and incongruity somehow mesh, due in part to the picture\u2019s spirit of cheerful, slobs-vs.-snobs anarchy, resulting in something akin to a coked-up Marx Brothers movie.  \u2014  A scene from \u201cCool Runnings.\u201d Buena Vista Pictures  \u2018Cool Runnings\u2019  Leaving Netflix: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  One of the highlights of the 1988 Winter Olympics (from a storytelling perspective, if not a sporting one) was the debut of the Jamaican national bobsled team, which quickly became a fan favorite for their clear discomfort with an event not exactly common to their tropical home. But it soon became a feel-good underdog story of teamwork in the face of adversity \u2014 in other words, ideal fodder for a big-screen dramatization by Disney. And what could have been a one-joke physical comedy play instead became a warmhearted \u201990s classic, thanks to the energetic direction by Jon Turteltaub (\u201cNational Treasure\u201d) and the charismatic turns by Doug E. Doug, Leon, Malik Yoba, and Rawle D. Lewis as the team members, and (in one of his final performances) the great John Candy as their coach.  \u2014  0  John Mulaney on \u201cJohn Mulaney: New in Town.\u201d Comedy Central  \u2018John Mulaney: New in Town\u2019  Leaving Netflix: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  This 2012 special from John Mulaney, the former \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d writer and stand-up comic extraordinaire, which originally aired on Comedy Central, was only his second such showcase, but he already showed an old-timer\u2019s mastery of the form. His deceptively simple persona, of a meek but good-hearted soul doing his very best to navigate a complicated world, proves durable and reliable as he explores dating, doctor\u2019s visits and basic social interactions. The show\u2019s funniest (if somewhat specialized) bit, however, may be his lengthy rumination on the pleasures of \u201cLaw & Order: Special Victims Unit\u201d and its resident skeptic, Ice-T.  \u2014  Alex Bailey/Fox Searchlight Pictures  \u2018Never Let Me Go\u2019  Leaving Netflix: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Kazuo Ishiguro\u2019s 2005 dystopian romance novel gets the big-screen treatment in this 2010 drama from director Mark Romanek (\u201cOne Hour Photo\u201d). Keira Knightley, Carey Mulligan and Andrew Garfield star as three students and occasional romantic partners who discover, in their teens, that all of them are clones \u2014 born and raised for the eventual harvesting of their organs. Screenwriter Alex Garland displays the thoughtful, chamber-music approach to science fiction of his subsequent \u201cEx Machina\u201d and \u201cAnnihilation\u201d (both of which he directed). Romanek, meanwhile, pulls off the neat trick of creating a cold, sterile world that is nonetheless infected by warmth and humanity \u2014 attributable in no small part to the skillful work of his crackerjack cast.  \u2014  Morgan Freeman in \u201cThe Shawshank Redemption.\u201d Columbia Pictures, via Everett Collection  \u2018The Shawshank Redemption\u2019  Leaving Netflix: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Removing this 1994 prison drama from Netflix probably won\u2019t dent its ubiquity \u2014 it\u2019s a regular topper of IMDb\u2019s Top 250 list and it seems to pop up on TNT or TBS on a near-weekly basis. But it still smarts not to have this cinematic comfort food a mouse-click away, as it features the quintessential Morgan Freeman performance (wise, calm, and narrating for clarity) and some of Tim Robbins\u2019 most complicated work (as a man who says little and reveals even less). Frank Darabont\u2019s patient filmmaking, in which a series of seemingly casual vignettes crescendo into an emotionally overwhelming climax, makes this a particularly re-watchable film, in which little throwaways and asides take on extra meaning upon second (and third, and tenth) viewings.  \u2014  David Bowie in \u201cThe Prestige.\u201d Touchstone Pictures  \u2018The Prestige\u2019  Leaving Netflix: April 21  April 21 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Between his first and second cracks at Batman, director Christopher Nolan slid in this twisty, stylish exercise in sleight-of-hand moviemaking, as if to assure the fans of his breakthrough movie \u201cMemento\u201d that he was still up to his old tricks. This time around, the term \u201ctricks\u201d is literal: In \u201cThe Prestige,\u201d Nolan tells the story of two stage magicians in 1890s London, whose friendly rivalry first becomes fraught, then deadly. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale scheme and connive appropriately in the leading roles; a standout supporting cast includes Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall and David Bowie.  \u2014  Banksy in a scene from \u201cExit Through the Gift Shop.\u201d Paranoid Pictures  \u2018Exit Through the Gift Shop\u2019  Leaving Netflix: April 22  April 22 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  The enigmatic and eccentric street artist Banksy directs this Oscar-nominated 2010 documentary, in which he profiles the rise of Thierry Guetta, known by the street-art name \u201cMister Brainwash.\u201d Frisky and funny, it casts a cynical insider\u2019s eye on the art world, as well as on Banksy\u2019s place inside it \u2014 particularly in retrospect because of rumors that Guetta was, in fact, a creation of Banksy\u2019s and that the entire story is a made-up prank. The director (who never reveals his face in the film) has denied the rumors, but they lend an extra dimension to this film, in which everything (and perhaps everyone) could be a bluff.  \u2014  Mark Ruffalo and Keira Knightley in \u201cBegin Again.\u201d Andrew Schwartz/Weinstein Company  \u2018Begin Again\u2019  Leaving Netflix: April 27  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  The Irish writer and director John Carney revisited his microbudget, Oscar-winning indie sensation \u201cOnce\u201d with a well-financed, star-cast exploration of the same themes: the magnificence of pop music, the semi-romantic charge of collaboration and the power of a song to say what can\u2019t be put into words alone. Keira Knightley is charming (and believable) as a songwriter who finds an unexpected champion in a burned-out record executive (Mark Ruffalo). The musical numbers are stirring, and the dramatic beats land, but its best scene is its simplest: its two protagonists, wandering through New York City with their headphones, playing each other their favorite songs. Sweet but not saccharine, it is full of tiny moments of truth.  \u2014", "stock": "NFLX", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-22", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/22/watching/leaving-netflix-movies-april.html"}, {"article": "Photo  The plan to have every episode of the second season of Marvel and Netflix\u2019s \u201cJessica Jones\u201d directed by women was conceived a year before the Harvey Weinstein revelations. But now that season arrives like a presciently timed herald of the #MeToo-Time\u2019s Up revolution, with 13 female directors and 9 of 13 episodes written or co-written by women. For added emphasis, it begins streaming on Thursday, which is International Women\u2019s Day.  This concentration of female creators is unusual, of course, particularly for a high-profile, comic-book-based drama. But \u201cJessica Jones\u201d was already one of the more women-centric dramas around when its first season appeared more than two years ago.  Its creator and showrunner, Melissa Rosenberg of the \u201cTwilight\u201d movies, focused tightly on Jones (Krysten Ritter), a moody private eye who had super strength forced on her as a child, and a few other female characters: Trish Walker (Rachael Taylor), a talk-radio host who is Jones\u2019s only friend, and Jeri Hogarth (Carrie-Anne Moss), a ruthless lawyer who helps Jones when it aligns with her own agenda.  In the first five episodes of Season 2 (an atypically small number for Netflix to provide for review), that triumvirate is even more central to the plot. And their portrayals have taken on new shades. Already isolated \u2014 none has children or a spouse \u2014 they are defined even more than before by their pain and rage and their desperate efforts to assert control over their lives. Jones is an emotional cripple unable to confront her past; Hogarth\u2019s monomaniacal focus on her career leaves her unprepared to face mortality. The relatively well-adjusted Walker is an abuse victim and recovering addict who can\u2019t commit to a relationship.

We\u2019ve seen a powerful person\u2019s downward spiral play out in a room with multiple hookers, cocaine and embarrassing dancing, but that person usually isn\u2019t a woman. We\u2019ve seen protagonists whose bottled-up anger turns them sullen, violent and heedless of others, but they\u2019re usually men. We\u2019ve seen the heroes of mystery-thrillers worry about their investigations putting loved ones in danger, but heroines not so much. (Conversely, traditional roles are preserved in a plot element involving Walker\u2019s past as a child star that explicitly invokes #MeToo.)

But a clich\u00e9 is still a clich\u00e9, whether it\u2019s presented from a female or male point of view. And the early episodes of the season make a lot of room for fairly static character development, with proportionally less attention paid to the traditional genre pleasures, like atmosphere and action, which were central to the first season\u2019s invigorating noir-superhero synthesis. (The noir part of the equation is still present, but dimly, in Jones\u2019s occasional voice-overs and in a preponderance of detective work that\u2019s pretty basic and arbitrary, a step or two above Googling when it isn\u2019t simply Googling.)", "stock": "NFLX", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-07", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/07/arts/television/marvel-jessica-jones-review-netflix.html"}, {"article": "Netflix NFLX 0.78% is glowing. \u201cWe had a beautiful Q4,\u201d the company preened in its letter to shareholders. It isn\u2019t wrong.  The streaming service reported earnings per share of 41 cents, up from 15 cents a year ago, and revenue of $3.29 billion, slightly beating analysts\u2019 estimates of $3.28 billion. Most impressively, it added 8.3 million subscribers globally\u2014the highest in the company\u2019s history\u2014even as it raised its subscription price to $11 a month. That is an 18% year-over-year increase, exceeding the company\u2019s own forecast of 6.3 million subscribers. Shares shot up 9% in after hours trading.  Legacy media, says Rich Greenfield of BTIG Research, should \u201cbe afraid, be very afraid.\u201d With hit content like \u201cStranger Things\u201d and \u201cThe Crown,\u201d Netflix has created a virtuous cycle: Subscribers keep joining at higher price points, allowing the company to spend more on content, which in turn allows them to draw in and retain more subscribers.  Of the over 8 million new subscribers, 6.36 million came from international markets. They have finally made Netflix\u2019s global segments profitable, delivering earnings of $227 million in 2017.  With an eye on competition, the company is accelerating its investments for 2018. It will raise marketing spending to $2 billion and spend $7.5 billion to $8 billion on new content, including 30 international original series in places like Poland, India, and Japan.  \u201cThis is a land grab opportunity,\u201d says Mr. Greenfield. \u201cThey see Disney , Apple , Amazon coming, and they\u2019re trying to extend their lead as far as possible before the competition gets going.\u201d  Netflix is slated to have a long lead indeed. Disney, which hopes to break into international markets with its acquisition of assets from 21st Century Fox , will find that Netflix has already beaten them there. It also plans to launch its own Disney-branded streaming service. Yet this likely won\u2019t happen before late 2019. Meanwhile, Hulu, in which Disney will have a 60% stake after the Fox deal, has added far fewer subscribers than Netflix even though it maintains a lower price.  Hit shows from HBO and Amazon will draw viewers. But content is unique, meaning streaming services can coexist comfortably. As long as Netflix continues producing such popular content, viewers will keep watching, and recently they are watching even more. In 2017, streaming hours per membership grew by 9% year-over-year.  Netflix\u2019s already ugly balance sheet will look even worse next year with negative free cash flow of $3 billion to $4 billion. The company expects to sell more high-yield bonds. None of that has mattered so far to its soaring stock price\u2014its market cap hit $100 billion\u2014or to its bonds.

Photo: facundo arrizabalaga/epa-efe/rex/EPA/Shutterstock  The world\u2019s media titans are locked in battle over Sky. The company driving the multibillion-dollar bidding drama is happily sitting on the couch: Netflix . NFLX 0.78%  Comcast gate-crashed an already lively party Tuesday by offering \u00a312.50 ($17.50) a share for Sky. That is 12% more than the \u00a310.75 on offer from 21st Century Fox and, by extension, Disney , DIS -0.04% which wants to buy Sky along with other Fox assets.  Including debt, the Comcast offer values Sky at $41 billion, which works out at 13 times expected earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, according to FactSet. Dish Network, traditionally a satellite distributor like Sky, trades on roughly five times Ebitda, after stripping out its spectrum assets, according to Will Milner at research house Arete.  Admittedly, Sky has a much stronger market position than Dish. It was the U.K.\u2019s first pay-TV company, with an offer anchored by Premier League soccer, and it has kept at the forefront of industry innovations like the set-top box and \u201cover-the-top\u201d streaming. As a result, it still serves more than twice as many U.K. households as its closest peer, Liberty Global\u2019s Virgin Media cable network.  This is Sky\u2019s essential appeal to both Comcast and Disney. It has a direct relationship with 23 million customers, not far from Comcast\u2019s 29 million. And they are mainly in markets\u2014the U.K. and Ireland\u2014that are already familiar with the kind of English-language TV content that both Comcast and Disney own and produce. In this Sky has no real peers.  Streaming giant Netflix\u2019s high stock-market valuation shows the appeal to investors of a global \u201cdirect-to-consumer\u201d platform. Something of this high valuation is now rubbing off on Sky as Disney and Comcast are both feeling increasing pressure to roll out something that competes with Netflix.  Both U.S. cable-and-media groups look set to be major beneficiaries of U.S. tax cuts, giving them cash to splurge. And given the antitrust uncertainty surrounding AT&T\u2019s bid for Time Warner, it is easy to see why Comcast has opted to focus on Sky rather than Fox. For regulators, Comcast may be the preferred bidder, with none of the issues about concentration of ownership in British media that have dogged Fox\u2019s bid.  The irony here is that Sky is itself being disrupted by streaming. Its growth has become increasingly dependent on its own over-the-top product, Now TV, which is much cheaper than its old full-service package. Some 2% to 3% of households are trading down from the premium package to Now TV a year. Stripping out mobile-phone contracts, research firm New Street Research estimates that Sky\u2019s U.K. subscription revenue\u2014the bedrock of its business\u2014rose just 0.8% year over year in the most recent quarter. Meanwhile, heavy technology investments have weighed on cash flows.  Sky shares rose to \u00a313.40 in afternoon trading Tuesday, suggesting investors expect a counteroffer from Fox or Disney. But the U.S. media giants should be wary of engaging in a bidding war for what is essentially an incumbent TV provider. Sky could end up part of the problem, not part of the solution.  The cable industry is undergoing a major transformation, as more Americans cut the cord on their cable subscriptions and flock to streaming services like Hulu and Netflix. So how did we get here?

In a letter to shareholders, Netflix acknowledged the emergence of more premium video content from technology companies like Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc., ad-supported platforms such as Facebook and Google\u2019s YouTube, and entertainment companies like Walt Disney Co. , which underscored its direct-to-consumer ambitions when it agreed to purchase most of 21st Century Fox for $52.4 billion.  \u201cThe market for entertainment time is vast and can support many successful services,\u201d the company said in the letter. \u201cEntertainment services are often complementary given their unique content offerings.\u201d  The expansion of direct-to-consumer video gave viewers an all-time high of 487 scripted shows across streaming and traditional TV in 2017, according to research from FX Networks.  Los Gatos, Calif.-based Netflix has been spending heavily on original programs to attract new subscribers. Netflix said Monday it would spend $7.5 billion to $8 billion on content this year, up from a forecast of $7 billion to $8 billion previously, far outstripping investments from rivals including Hulu, Amazon and HBO.  And Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings said on the company\u2019s earnings call that content costs will continue to rise in 2019 and 2020.  Netflix said it now has $17.7 billion in streaming-content obligations, a measure of current and future costs for content acquisition, licensing and production.  In a rare move, the company took a $39 million noncash charge in the fourth quarter on content it decided not to release, which Chief Financial Officer David Wells said was \u201crelated to the societal reset around sexual harassment.\u201d Last year, Netflix cut ties with actor Kevin Spacey after he was accused of sexual harassment, and the streaming service said it would bring the hit drama \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d back for one final season without Mr. Spacey.  Netflix also said it would boost its spending on technology and increase its marketing budget to $2 billion this year from $1.3 billion.

So how did we get here? Illustration: Shaumbe Wright/WSJ  The increased spending comes with a trade-off, as Netflix blew through $2 billion more in cash than it brought in last year, and this year the company projects negative free cash flow of $3 billion to $4 billion. But the company said Monday that rising operating profits and slowing growth in original content spending will eventually lead to positive free cash flow.  \u201cThey are spending more on content and burning more cash,\u201d Anthony DiClemente, internet analyst at Evercore ISI, said. \u201cHowever, as long as the revenue growth is accelerating and the net subscriber additions continue, investors will look past the spending.\u201d  Netflix shares set a record closing price on Monday at $227.58, about 227 times earnings.  The company added 6.36 million foreign subscribers in the quarter, compared with its forecast of 5.05 million. It added 1.98 million U.S. subscribers, compared with its outlook for 1.25 million.  Netflix expects the growth to continue in the current quarter, projecting net additions of 1.45 million U.S. subscribers and 4.9 million international customers.  Netflix has increased its international investments in recent years. More than half of its total subscribers are from countries outside the U.S. and it plans over 30 international-focused original series this year, including in France, Poland, India and Korea. Monday, the company said the international segment contributed positively to the company\u2019s full-year profit for the first time.  Netflix said revenue increased 33% to $3.29 billion in its fourth quarter, above analysts\u2019 estimates.  Net income came in at $185.5 million, or 41 cents a share, compared with $66.7 million, or 15 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter.  Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had expected earnings of 41 cents a share on $3.28 billion in revenue.

He and his cast sampled the Mexican staple everywhere from the Yucat\u00e1n to Copenhagen.  One of his favorite tacos came from a food truck in L.A. It featured ingredients usually associated with the Middle East\u2014shawarma (meat sliced from a turning spit) and a thick, pitalike flour tortilla. In the show, he traced the history of these \u201cArab tacos\u201d back to the city of Puebla, about 80 miles southeast of Mexico City. There, Mr. Chang learned, immigrants from the Middle East helped to create the tacos decades ago.  He came across plenty of other cross-cultural connections in exploring other iconic dishes for the show. In Houston, he tasted Viet-Cajun crawfish, a combination of a New Orleans Creole dish with Vietnamese seasoning. In Italy, he noted how much tortellini look like wontons. \u201cEvery type of food came from somewhere else,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that just sprouted from someone\u2019s head.\u201d  Mr. Chang, 40, is best known for founding the Momofuku Group, with over a dozen Asian-inspired restaurants around the world, as well as six locations of the fast-casual chain Fuku and 13 Milk Bar dessert stores. He\u2019s still expanding his restaurant empire, which offers indulgent, sometimes oddball dishes such as kimchi bacon burgers and his much-imitated barbecued pork-belly buns. The chef and his restaurants have won five James Beard Awards, and one of the New York locations, Momofuku Ko, has carried two Michelin stars since 2009.  \u201cI think Momofuku has always tried to be a merger of things that don\u2019t always go together,\u201d Mr. Chang says. As for his show, \u201cwhen you say the word \u2018ugly delicious\u2019 it made sense.\u201d Many of his favorite dishes, such as curries and noodles, look ugly, he says.  The show\u2019s eight thematic episodes range from fried chicken to pizza to barbecue. The series asks why some cultures and not others readily assimilate new foods and dishes from afar. An area\u2019s tradition and its immigration history are major factors, Mr. Chang discovered. New Orleans, he found, was hesitant to accept new flavors and experimentation, in part thanks to a proud Creole culinary past. Houston, on the other hand, embraced waves of immigrants and their cooking techniques.  Mr. Chang now appreciates his own culture more, he says, partly because he \u2018ran away from it to begin with.\u2019 Photo: Austin Hargrave for The Wall Street Journal  For Mr. Chang, such stories have a strong personal resonance. The son of Korean immigrants, he grew up outside of Washington, D.C., in suburban Virginia. His mother made fried rice and chicken soup and his grandmother would make Korean dumplings, he remembers. His father used to take him to local pho and ramen spots, where Mr. Chang would watch in wonder as the chefs worked the dough and pulled it into long strands. \u201cThat\u2019s how my dad expressed love to me, by going out to eat,\u201d he says.  His parents were in the restaurant business for a time, but their two establishments served American fare\u2014 salads, soups and steaks. Mr. Chang never thought he would grow up to be a chef. \u201cI knew restaurants were in my dad\u2019s blood,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand until later that it could be a profession.\u201d  Mr. Chang was a champion golfer in high school, and his father wanted him to try being a professional, but he didn\u2019t enjoy the sport. Unsure of a career, he spent two years after college teaching English in Japan, where he fell in love with the local ramen shops. He kept copious notes of what he saw there, right down to the flavorings in the first slurp of soup.  When he returned to the U.S., he took a desk job in finance\u2014and hated it. He quit after six months and enrolled at the French Culinary Institute (now the International Culinary Center) in New York, with stints afterward at high-end restaurants in the city such as Craft and Caf\u00e9 Boulud.  When he finally decided to strike out on his own, it was to embrace the Asian food of his childhood: \u201cI think part of it is accepting being me.\u201d He now appreciates his own culture more, he says, partly because he \u201cran away from it to begin with.\u201d  In 2004, Mr. Chang started Momofuku Noodle Bar as a casual ramen spot. In six months, once he adjusted the menu to his liking, lines started forming out the door. His restaurant empire has expanded relentlessly since then.  Critics heaped praise on Mr. Chang\u2019s early restaurants but have not been as enthusiastic about one recent venture. A 2016 review of his new Italian-inflected restaurant by New York Times food critic Pete Wells was headlined: \u201cDavid Chang\u2019s Magic Shows a Little Wear.\u201d  Mr. Chang responded to the review in a New Yorker profile of Mr. Wells, saying, \u201cHe\u2019s being a [expletive] bully.\u201d These days, Mr. Chang thinks that customer reviews on services such as Yelp carry just as much weight as the opinions of professional critics.  Mr. Chang has experienced some failures as his business has expanded. Last year, he attempted to launch his own meal-preparation and delivery service, and a few years before that he invested in another. Both have since closed. Mr. Chang has said that delivery services were difficult to get right.  But the chef is still creating new concepts for restaurants and figuring out where to start them. Majordomo, which opened earlier this year in L.A., offers creative takes on basics and recently included short ribs with beef rice and shiso rice paper, and macaroni and chickpeas with black pepper.  Mr. Chang remains committed to experimenting and expanding. \u201cIt\u2019s this giant thing, and I don\u2019t know how it grows, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s going to grow.\u201d But he worries, too: \u201cEvery day feels like it\u2019s all going to end simultaneously.\u201d  Write to Alexandra Wolfe at alexandra.wolfe@wsj.com", "stock": "NFLX", "label": 1, "date": "2018-04-07", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/david-changs-culinary-mash-ups-1523030104"}, {"article": "Matters that seem arcane are often vitally important, because they can be worth tens of billions of dollars. Such is the case with \u201crisk adjustment\u201d in health care. Medical spending is not spread evenly across all people in society. Half the population uses hardly any care in a given year\u2014only 3% of total spending. Conversely, 10% of Americans consume about two-thirds of all health-care spending.  Consequently, when someone buys an ObamaCare plan or enrolls in a Medicare Advantage managed-care plan, the federal government needs to adjust the fixed premium (or subsidy) it pays to account for how sick the person is. Patients who have serious conditions come with bigger government payments. Without this adjustment, insurers and health-care providers would have a strong incentive to care only for healthy people.  Photo: istock/getty images  While the concept sounds simple, risk adjustment is among the factors that make health care so maddeningly complicated. For an \u201caverage patient\u201d in Erie County, N.Y., the government will pay a private insurer offering a Medicare Advantage plan roughly $9,500 a year. But for a patient with lung cancer, diabetes with complications, depression and macular degeneration, risk adjustment triples the amount to just over $27,000 a year.  That large difference is intended to ensure that the sick patient can continue to get care. But consider the incentives it sets up. As every physician knows, many diseases are diagnosed and their severity assessed based on clinical judgment as opposed to objective criteria. Others may be under control or no longer relevant and aptly characterized as \u201cpast medical history.\u201d Finally, many conditions emerge in almost everyone with age.  Risk adjustment gives doctors and Medicare Advantage insurers a financial reason to ignore these nuances. Instead they have incentives to find every possible diagnosis\u2014and then to make the patient\u2019s conditions sound as severe as possible\u2014so as to raise government payments the most.  This gaming is pervasive enough to have a name: up-coding. In 2016 the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services audited 37 Medicare Advantage health plans. Thirty-five had overcharged the government, commonly by overstating the severity of diabetes and depression. A 2016 study from the Government Accountability Office suggests this practice costs taxpayers billions of dollars a year in overpayments.  Because Medicare cannot police every plan, it has attacked the problem with a sledgehammer, enacting an annual \u201ccoding intensity adjustment,\u201d which in 2018 will reduce premiums by \u201cat least 5.91%.\u201d But this adjustment, which insurers aggressively lobby to minimize, penalizes honest Medicare Advantage plans, too. Ultimately, it does not solve the problem because insurers build the \u201cpenalty\u201d into their premiums.  Up-coding also diverts providers and insurers from finding ways to improve care and reduce costs. This effect is reinforced by the Affordable Care Act\u2019s \u201cmedical loss ratio\u201d rules, which require insurers to spend at least 85% of premiums on clinical care. The only way to increase profits, then, is to raise revenues while keeping administrative costs the same. Gaming risk adjustment is an easy way to do that.  Doctors find risk adjustment incredibly frustrating. Medicare Advantage plans torment them with reminders to do annual visits, in the guise of \u201cwellness visits,\u201d to code every disease in every patient. A whole industry of opportunistic intermediaries like Inovalon, hired by health-insurance companies, support up-coding by retrieving patient charts, mining them for abnormal lab values or prescriptions indicative of diseases that aren\u2019t being billed, and then faxing back \u201csuggestions\u201d for added diagnoses. This distracts doctors, provides no value for patients, and sucks tons of money out of the system.  How to clean up this mess? Begin by acknowledging that current methods of risk adjustment are not very good. On average, the factors used by Medicare today\u2014mainly data from past claims\u2014can account for only about 36% of the true variation in patient spending due to disease. That means lots of extra money is flowing for diagnoses that do not necessarily imply the assumed increased costs.  One way for Medicare to do better would be to emulate Netflix . Beginning in 2006, Netflix ran a world-wide contest to improve Cinematch, its proprietary algorithm for predicting how users would rate films they\u2019d never seen. The grand prize was $1 million. Within a year, over 2,000 separate teams from 150 countries had submitted more than 13,000 algorithms. Eventually, the winning team, which included researchers from AT&T Labs, Yahoo and an Austrian consulting firm, improved the algorithm by more than 10%. For a tiny cost, Netflix got a huge amount of computer-science research that even its highly skilled employees could not perform.  Medicare should do the same: create a contest open to anyone in the world who can beat its current risk-adjustment model. To ensure fairness and encourage competition, administering it should be outsourced to the X Prize Foundation or a similar group. The winner should be able to use objective patient data to account for at least 45% of the spending variation caused by disease. Medicare could award a $10 million grand prize and several million for second and third place. It also should be required to adopt one of the top methods. (There may be practical reasons not to pick the winner.)  To prevent insurers from figuring out how to game this updated risk-adjustment model, Medicare should run a new contest every five to seven years. Tens of millions in prize money could save taxpayers tens of billions a year in up-coding gimmicks.

The streaming video giant\u2019s stock is down 4.9% in the first two days of the week to about $316, a rare pullback for shares that have more than doubled over the last 12 months and climbed 22% in the last month alone. The gains have outshone many of Netflix\u2019s high-flying tech-focused peers.  The recent drop followed remarks by short-seller Andrew Left of Citron Research, who said in a tweet Monday that shares, \u201ccan be shorted back to $300,\u201d after the company\u2019s market cap surged in the preceding week.  \u201cI think the market has become over-enthused by the product and not realistic about the economics,\u201d he said in an interview. Mr. Left, who is known for shorting such companies as Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc., said he is currently betting against the stock.  Netflix shares have a long history of momentum-driven growth that\u2019s drawn passionate arguments from both bulls and bears. The company has posted consistently strong subscriber growth and invested heavily in its original content. It\u2019s also been burning through cash and borrowing heavily. It faces a slew of upstart rivals, from Amazon.com Inc. to Walt Disney Co.  Scott Devitt, an analyst at Stifel, recently dropped his rating on the company to \u201chold,\u201d from \u201cbuy.\u201d In a report to clients last week, he wrote that the \u201cshare price may have sprinted ahead of fundamentals in the short-term.\u201d  The company\u2019s chief executive, Reed Hastings, has counted himself among the stock price skeptics in the past. In the summer of 2015, when the stock was at about $100, Mr. Hastings said in response to a question about whether the stock is overpriced: \u201cwhen the stock was half this price, I described it as euphoric. So it\u2019s a mystery to me.\u201d  Still, the recent surge has its benefits, the company has said. In a recent quarterly letter, the company noted that a thick \u201cequity cushion\u201d has been good for its borrowing in the junk bond market. The company has about $6.5 billion in total debt, according to FactSet, and its bond prices have held up relatively well recently. A spokesman for the firm declined to comment.  The Netflix critics have had a tough run recently. The stock had an average short position worth $5.5 billion so far this year, which has sustained paper losses of nearly $3 billion in 2018 through the end of last week, according to financial analytics firm S3 Partners. So far this week, they\u2019ve made back about $319 million.  Short sellers bet against a stock by borrowing from a lender and selling it, hoping to buy it back at a lower price when they return it later on. They pocket the difference if the stock has fallen, but can expose themselves to sharp losses if it rises, as Netflix has done.  The number of shorted shares has fallen recently as investors pared their positions. Many have bumped up against limits on how much risk they can take as the stock price has risen, according to Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3. Short interest as a share of float hit an all-time low of just under 5% last month, as fewer shares were shorted and the number of outstanding shares increased.  \u2013 Ken Jimenez and Sam Goldfarb contributed to this article", "stock": "NFLX", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-13", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2018/03/13/netflixs-massive-rally-draws-attention-of-skeptics/"}, {"article": "The biggest antitrust trial since U.S. v. Microsoft begins Monday in a federal court in Washington. The Justice Department seeks to block the $108 billion merger between AT&T and Time Warner. But the government doesn\u2019t stand a chance\u2014like Wile E. Coyote chasing Road Runner off a cliff and ending up suspended in midair.  What may have started as a Trumpian jab at #FakeNewsCNN has tragically turned into a serious antitrust action. The Justice Department\u2019s case stands on such modern foundations as Section 7 of the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, which can block mergers whose effect \u201cmay be substantially to lessen competition.\u201d  The crux of the case is that AT&T\u2019s subsidiary DirecTV, with its 21 million U.S. subscribers (about a fifth of the cable and satellite market), should not be combined with Time Warner\u2019s HBO, with its 54 million U.S. subscribers. The result would be a \u201cvertically integrated programmer\u201d with the alleged ability to raise prices at will on other cable operators. It could even (horrors) withhold HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d from DirecTV\u2019s competitors.  I\u2019ve got to admit, even four or five years ago, I might have agreed. The cable industry has abused geographic monopolies to raise prices almost since the first coaxial cables were strung on telephone poles. Comcast \u2019s 2011 merger with NBCUniversal was potentially anticompetitive, which is why the government imposed 150 different conditions on it. But the landscape has changed since then. A lot.

Fallon/Bloomberg News  If I were AT&T\u2019s attorney, I\u2019d introduce as evidence a clip from the \u201cFranchise Prequel\u201d episode of \u201cSouth Park,\u201d which makes fun of Netflix for funding so many new TV series. A Netflix employee answers the phone saying: \u201cNetflix, you\u2019re greenlit. Who am I speaking with? . . . Would you like a pilot or just go straight to an order of six episodes?\u201d  Since \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d took off in 2013, Netflix has run amok, releasing an estimated 126 original series and films in 2016, and maybe 200 last year. That\u2019s something on the order of 1,000 hours, or 40 full days, of binge watching. Some of these efforts are great, some are good, and most are just filler, like \u201c Bill Nye Saves the World.\u201d But so what? The point is they are distributed on the internet, via cable modems or mobile phones. AT&T and Time Warner have little influence, and nobody\u2014from ABC to HBO\u2014has a lock on entertainment these days.  Netflix has 55 million American subscribers and, gulp, raised its prices in November. Netflix doesn\u2019t license its shows to anyone else in the U.S.! Should the government break it up? By the way, that \u201cSouth Park\u201d episode is available on Viacom \u2019s Comedy Central, though Hulu\u2019s 17 million subscribers can also watch it online.  Amazon Prime has something like 80 million subscribers in the U.S., and 26 million of them watch the company\u2019s original content. Google\u2019s YouTube is now offering streaming TV, basically a $40-a-month substitute for cable. Similarly, Hulu has Live TV and Sony has PlayStation Vue. All March Madness games can be streamed online. Consumers have choices.  And we\u2019re just getting started. Worried about cord-cutting, Disney has paid $2.5 billion for a 75% stake in BAMTech, Major League Baseball\u2019s streaming company. RBC analyst Steven Cahall suggests Disney could spend $15 billion a year on streaming shows. That partially explains why Mickey Mouse is chasing 21st Century Fox .  Or look at the raw figures. Programming is a $90-billion-a-year business. Both Fox and Time Warner spend around $8 billion on nonsports content. Netflix spent $6 billion last year and hopes to hit $8 billion in 2018. Amazon spends $5 billion. Where is the market dominance?  Apple has sold more than a billion iPhones and is spending $1 billion this year getting its feet wet with original programming. The company recently put up millions for two seasons of a show about, ugh, a TV morning show, produced and starring Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston. If anything, extreme competition has shifted the balance of power to actors\u2014or, as some in Silicon Valley call them, meat puppets.  The AT&T antitrust case smells quite similar to the arguments for net neutrality, which also ignore real competition and emerging technologies. The feds are chasing ghosts. As they should be well aware, vertically structured companies tend to fall ill or die from natural causes\u2014see General Motors , IBM and, well, AT&T. No one pays 25 cents a minute for long-distance calls anymore.  Still, I\u2019m not sure why AT&T needs to get in bed with Hollywood, which year after year degrades the meaning of \u201cBest Picture.\u201d AT&T should instead return to a focus on technical excellence.

VZ -0.17% and Comcast Corp. CMCSA -0.33% are in tight competition for least-inspiring telecom company.  Cable network subscribers have gone from single-digit growth, to flat and now to declining. For Verizon and Comcast, both of which reported fourth-quarter earnings this week, those losses are getting worse as subscribers opt for streaming services like Netflix.  Verizon lost 29,000 Fios video customers this quarter, up from 18,000 in the third quarter and 15,000 in the second. Comcast similarly reported a loss of 33,000 video customers, an increase from 22,390 last quarter.  The erosion is unlikely to slow soon. \u201cWe don\u2019t expect the level of competition to diminish,\u201d Comcast said of the video sector.  \u201cWhy watch live TV?\u201d says Rich Greenfield of BTIG Research. \u201cThe amount of content on demand has gotten really good, really fast. And cable networks are competing not just against new shows, but against every great show ever made.\u201d  Verizon offset these losses as more customers signed up for wireless plans and high-speed internet. It narrowly missed analysts\u2019 expectations, reporting 86 cents per share, rather than 88 cents, and revenue of $33.96 billion. Savings from tax cuts will give it $3.5 billion to $4 billion in extra cash, boosting full-year earnings. Shares are up 1% since it announced results on Tuesday.  Comcast\u2019s results were stronger, reporting 49 cents per share above the 47-cent estimates, and revenue of $21.92 billion. It will use its tax windfall to increase its dividend by 21% and buy back $5 billion in stock this year. Investors are likely disappointed that the company wasn\u2019t more aggressive in its share buybacks. Shares were flat after the announcement on Wednesday.  \u201cIt\u2019s impolitic to buy back too much at once. Trump has said he doesn\u2019t want that to happen,\u201d said Craig Moffett, a media analyst at MoffettNathanson.  The buyback also leaves little room for acquisitions. Despite a deal-making rush in the industry, Verizon similarly insisted that it will not seek a merger.  Neither company looks compelling for the foreseeable future. But with strong growth in its NBCUniversal business and the Super Bowl and Winter Olympics expected to bring in $1.4 billion in ad revenue, Comcast remains slightly less uninspiring.  The cable industry is undergoing a major transformation, as more Americans cut the cord on their cable subscriptions and flock to streaming services like Hulu and Netflix. So how did we get here?

Image: Netflix/Beta Films  The roaring 1920s are given a German twist in \u201cBabylon Berlin,\u201d a lavish television series that chronicles the social turmoil leading up to the Third Reich.  It premiered last October in Germany and became one of the country\u2019s most-watched shows, just behind the seventh season of \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d On Tuesday it begins streaming in the U.S. via Netflix , with subtitles. The show\u2019s depiction of crime, corruption and political unrest led German newspaper Die Zeit to note its \u201calmost eerie parallels to the present.\u201d  \u201cAt the time people did not realize how absolutely unstable this new construction of society which the Weimar Republic represented was,\u201d says series co-director Tom Tykwer. \u201cIt interested us because the fragility of democracy has been put to the test quite profoundly in recent years.\u201d  Hitler\u2019s name is only mentioned once during the German-language show\u2019s first season, and then only when he is referred to as a joke candidate. In the German federal election of 1928, Nazis won a mere 2.6% of the vote. Five years later, they took 44%.  Tom Tykwer previously directed \u2018Run Lola Run\u2019 and other films before tackling \u2018Babylon Berlin.\u2019 Photo: Axel Schmidt/REUTERS  Based on novels by the German crime writer Volker Kutscher, \u201cBabylon Berlin\u201d cost about $40 million, making it one of the most expensive German TV series ever made, according to a spokeswoman for Beta Film, which sold the series in 60 countries. It is also the first German co-production between a public broadcaster, ARD, and a private one, Sky, she said.  Co-written and co-directed by Mr. Tykwer and fellow German filmmakers Henk Handloegten and Achim von Borries, the show required 180 days of shooting, nearly 300 locations, 5,000 extras and features a jazzy soundtrack from Bryan Ferry. It stars 37-year-old Volker Bruch \u2014one of the leads in the Emmy-winning \u201cGeneration War\u201d\u2014as Gereon Rath, a haunted, self-medicating police commissioner from Cologne who is transferred to the vice squad in Berlin, a city he knows little about.  \u201cFrom the first day the city swallows him up in a big breath,\u201d says producer Stefan Arndt, who helped develop the show. \u201cCologne is old-fashioned, while in Berlin there\u2019s sex, drugs and women with short hair.\u201d  One of these women is Charlotte Ritter (Liv Lisa Fries) who supports her impoverished family by working as an archivist for the police by day and a prostitute by night. Her dream is to become the first woman to be employed as a detective in the all-male Berlin police force.  Liv Lisa Fries plays Charlotte Ritter in \u2018Babylon Berlin.\u2019 Photo: X Filme Creative Pool  \u201cBy 1929, new opportunities were arising,\u201d says Mr. Tykwer, whose fast-paced direction is reminiscent of his 1998 breakout film \u201cRun Lola Run.\u201d \u201cWomen had more possibilities to take part in society, especially in the labor market as Berlin became crowded with new thinking, new art, theater, music and journalistic writing.\u201d  Nonetheless Mr. Tykwer says that he and his co-directors were determined not to idealize those days. \u201cPeople tend to forget that it was also a very rough era in German history,\u201d the 52-year-old director says. \u201cThere was a lot of poverty, and people who had survived the war were suffering from a great deal of trauma.\u201d  Mr. Rath\u2019s first case when he arrives in Berlin is to bust a pornography ring whose members have been covertly filming prominent public figures having sex with prostitutes. The show also examines police brutality toward communists in the Weimar Republic and the stealthy, post-World War I buildup of a secret army that is far greater than the one permitted by the Treaty of Versailles.  \u201cFrom an historical perspective the series is very acute in showing how Weimar democracy was under attack both from the communist left, as well as by traditional conservatives, in a kind of unholy alliance,\u201d says Thomas Weber, a German historian not involved with the show but whose 2010 book \u201cHitler\u2019s First War\u201d is in development as a TV series.  By the end of season two of \u201cBabylon Berlin,\u201d which has already aired in Germany, the Nazi Party is beginning to make its xenophobic presence felt, as citizens grow disillusioned with the Weimar Republic\u2014a period Mr. Weber sees as mirrored in Germany today with the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany party.  The AfD has rejected any comparison with the Nazi party. But it is robustly anti-immigration and some of its leaders have called for a reassessment of 20th-century German history.  On Netflix, the two eight-episode seasons of \u201cBabylon Berlin\u201d are joining other foreign-language shows available to U.S. subscribers, including France\u2019s \u201cThe Frozen Dead,\u201d South Korea\u2019s \u201cBlack\u201d and Spain\u2019s \u201cLa Casa de Papel.\u201d  Mr. Handloegten says that the show\u2019s third season, currently being written, will encompass the 1929 stock market crash, which was devastating to Germany\u2019s working class.  \u201cOne of the main reasons to make \u2018Babylon Berlin\u2019 was to show how all these Nazis did not just fall from the sky,\u201d he says. \u201cThey were human beings who reacted to German society\u2019s changes and made their decisions accordingly.\u201d  Write to Tobias Grey at wsje.weekend@wsj.com", "stock": "NFLX", "label": 1, "date": "2018-01-27", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-hit-drama-in-germany-babylon-berlin-crosses-the-atlantic-1517054137"}, {"article": "(Reuters) - Chipmaker Nvidia Corp said on Tuesday it has suspended self-driving tests across the globe, a week after an Uber Technologies Inc autonomous vehicle struck and killed a woman crossing a street in Arizona.

The price of Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, rose more than 1,300 percent in 2017. Prices have, however, dropped about 40 percent this year.  Nvidia\u2019s revenue from gaming, for which it is best known, rose 29 percent to $1.74 billion, accounting for a more than half of its total revenue in the fourth quarter, and also beating analysts\u2019 estimate of $1.59 billion.  The company forecast current-quarter revenue of $2.90 billion, plus or minus 2 percent, well above the analysts\u2019 average estimate of $2.47 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Net income rose to $1.12 billion, or $1.78 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Jan. 28 from $655 million, or 99 cents per share, a year earlier.  Results include a $133 million gain related to the new U.S. tax law.  Total revenue rose 34 percent to $2.91 billion, topping estimate of $2.69 billion.  Excluding items, the company said it earned $1.72 per share.  Nvidia earned $1.57 per share, excluding the tax benefit, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, beating estimate of $1.17.

The company\u2019s share price rose 6 percent in early trading on Friday after at least 14 Wall Street brokerages raised their price targets on the stock - a measure of the confidence around the stock among sector analysts.  Gamers use GPUs to play high-quality video games, but Nvidia\u2019s high-performing cards are also now used by those building machines to solve the complex math puzzles used to validate transactions and earn more of cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and bitcoin.  The company\u2019s Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said on a conference call on Thursday that inventory levels for gaming GPUs were at historically low levels due to cryptocurrency miners.  \u201cWe do think that cryptocurrency has been a very significant factor in both revenue and pricing, creating a shortage environment that is boosting pricing,\u201d Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore said in a note after the results.  Analysts also say Nvidia\u2019s competitive advantage is only likely to increase when it moves its Volta chip architecture, launched last year and only currently present in data-center GPUs, into gaming chips later this year.  The new GPU gaming chip, code named Turing, is expected to be unveiled next month. Even without it, Nvidia\u2019s revenue from gaming rose 29 percent to $1.74 billion in the fourth quarter, accounting for more than half of its total revenue.  The company\u2019s quarterly data center revenue - powered by the Volta-based data center GPU, Tesla V100 - more than doubled to $606 million as companies such as Alibaba (BABA.N), Amazon (AMZN.O), Alphabet (GOOGL.O), IBM (IBM.N) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) adopted the new chip in their servers.  Data centers outperformed despite high expectations and Barclays analyst Blayne Curtis said they should do so again given that Volta is in the early stages of adoption.  One pocket of concern was an 8 percent fall in automotive revenue quarter over quarter.

The NYSE FANG+ index, tracking the FANG block and its megacap brethren, tumbled 5.6 percent in the biggest rout in data going back to September 2014.  Twitter Inc. led the plunge with a 12 percent decline as all 10 index members retreated. Facebook Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Netflix Inc. and Google\u2019s parent Alphabet Inc. slumped at least 3.8 percent.  Many of the big names in the industry had their own reasons for bad days: Twitter being targeted by short sellers, Facebook\u2019s ongoing privacy scandal and Nvidia Corp.\u2019s suspension of driving vehicle testing, for starters. Not to mention growing doubts over Tesla Inc.\u2019s new models and a second probe into a car crash.  But for skeptics such as Jeff Gundlach and Howard Marks, the plunge is long overdue. The FANG index\u2019s advance from early 2016 through this month\u2019s peak reached an annualized rate of 67 percent, outpacing even the Nasdaq Composite Index\u2019s return in the final two years of the dot-com bubble.  \u201cIt\u2019s been such a good performer that at this point it\u2019s kind of on the defensive,\u201d Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Co., said by phone. \u201cThere\u2019s so many people with so many gains in technology.\u201d  There is also a valuation case to be made for the intensified selling. While the FANG companies\u2019 dominance in areas from social media to e-commerce will foster faster growth, their multiples are eye-watering.  Valuation Case  At 65 times earnings in mid March, the group was valued almost three times as richly as the S&P 500 Index. That\u2019s comparable with tech stocks in March 2000.  Since peaking on March 12, the FANG index has fallen in all but three days, sliding 12 percent along the way. Tuesday\u2019s drop wiped off about $180 billion in market value.  \u201cThe fact that the tech selloff accelerated in afternoon on heavy volume probably means a selloff will continue,\" said Stephen Carl, head trader at Williams Capital Group. \u201cOne thing is feeding into another here: uncertainty over the tariffs, Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony, weakness in Tesla.

Thanks to fresh blows to companies from Nvidia Corp. to Facebook Inc., the biggest industry in the S&P 500 Index dropped 3.5 percent, the biggest decline since the broad market selloff reached its worst point on Feb. 8. The Nasdaq 100 Index sank for a ninth decline in 11 days. Facebook gave up gains to slump 4.9 percent, with Mark Zuckerberg expected to appear before a House committee in the latest development in the company\u2019s escalating privacy scandal.  While the loss pales in comparison to last week\u2019s worst tumble since 2015, the renewed weakness underscores the vulnerability in an industry whose growth prospects have lured investors, spurring stock gains that have doubled the market in the past three years.

The computer-chip maker Nvidia Corp. didn't fumble an earnings forecast, but its stock tumbled this week, too. Facebook Inc.'s financial power hasn't weakened (so far), yet it has shed a Morgan Stanley worth of market value in two weeks.  Right now, investors worry technology companies might succumb not to competition or business missteps, but to consequences of their own hubris or market power. It all feels overdue, but also odd. We've been writing for so long about the looming technology reckoning that it's surprising to realize investors finally care.  Amazon's stock price fell 4.4 percent on Wednesday after Axios reported that President Donald Trump is \"obsessed\" with the e-commerce titan and imagines ways to curtail its power. In a tweet on Thursday, Trump confirmed that he's concerned about Amazon's impact on cities and states, the U.S. Postal Service and smaller retailers. In response, Amazon shares are falling in early trading.  Facebook has dropped since revelations that a political consulting firm took advantage of the company's formerly lax data rules. Nvidia shares are down almost 10 percent this week after the company said it would suspend tests of driverless cars on public roads in response to an Uber autonomous car hitting and killing a pedestrian. (Nvidia provides technology for Uber's autonomous cars.)  Feeling the Pain A half dozen prominent U.S. tech companies have lost more than $80 billion of combined stock market value this week Source: Bloomberg  These companies aren't all faultless victims. Amazon is not a cuddly charity. Years of Facebook's cavalier attitude about data privacy and the downsides of its social network have created this crisis. Right now, though, investors are realizing that tech companies are so big, pervasive and economically important that suspicion is a permanent fact of life now, and backlash has become a real cost of doing business.  I was both surprised, and not, at Amazon's stock reaction. The U.S. president's antipathy for Amazon or CEO Jeff Bezos is no secret. Last summer, Trump tweeted a not-quite-accurate criticism about Amazon's tax payments. He also said previously that Amazon had a \"huge antitrust problem,\" and tweeted that the company is hurting U.S. cities and states. In December and again in Thursday's tweet, Trump said the U.S. Postal Service's finances were hurt by its business with Amazon. (That one is more complicated than 280 characters can convey). It's tough to know whether Trump truly believes Amazon is causing harm, or whether he harbors a grudge against the Bezos-owned Washington Post. Maybe both.  Trump isn't alone in questioning Amazon's power, but there's not an easy legal weapon to wield. Axios said Trump has \"talked about changing Amazon's tax treatment,\" but it's not clear how tax changes could specifically target Amazon. The company is well-regarded by consumers. Amazon is a bogeyman of many industries, but it only captures perhaps a few percentage points of total U.S. retail spending. Conventional approaches to antitrust law don't apply easily to Amazon, although some academics have said the applications of the law need to change. And needless to say, the White House doesn't directly control U.S. antitrust authorities.  Losing Their Bite An index of 10 large global technology companies, including Facebook and Apple, has dipped 14 percent from a mid-March peak Source: Bloomberg  Assuming Trump's tweet barrage against Amazon doesn't continue, the company's stock decline is likely to be short-lived. But investors' temporary panic is understandable. It's far better for powerful tech companies like Amazon to fly under the radar right now. Apple and Amazon should have sent thank-you cards to Mark Zuckerberg for drawing 100 percent of the fire recently from members of Congress, global regulators and skeptical tech journalists. But the fresh glimpse at Trump's thinking showed that there's plenty of unwanted attention to go around for the tech giants.  There's also general investor rethinking -- not for the first time -- about the tech concentration in the stock market after several years of outsize gains in the sector. As with market reaction to the tech backlash, this has little to do with the tech superpowers' current businesses, which remain solid. Nothing has changed. Except everything has changed.

How\u2019d Zuck Do?  The early market gains from Xi\u2019s trade-war-soothing keynote held, for the most part, and accelerated once Zuckerberg took the stage at the first of two congressional hearings. The response was overwhelmingly positive to his cool, calm, and collected demeanor, as traders bid up Facebook (FB +4.5%) and the rest of the tech space (S5INFT +2.2%). Here\u2019s what the Street had to say about the performance:  Evercore ISI analyst Anthony DiClemente, who rates FB an outperform, said Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony was \"sometimes tedious, other times repetitive, but mostly -- and this is a good thing -- uneventful\"; he added that Zuckerberg delivered balanced and reasonable answers to questions and \"seemed to strike the right tone\" as he found plenty of common ground with the lawmakers; DiClemente saw little in the testimony that should negatively impact investors\u2019 view of Facebook\u2019s long-term growth and business opportunity  Suntrust analyst Youssef Squali, who rates FB a buy, said that while no major news emerged from the testimony, \"we believe that this is a seminal event, one that\u2019s likely to lead to increased regulation (a la GDPR)\" that should still favor larger platforms like FB and GOOGL in the end  Big Move, But Still Range Bound  Energy stocks had the best day of all (S5ENRS +3.3%, biggest upside move since Nov. 2016) thanks to a continuation of the rip in crude prices. The sector has been the big winner so far in April while the defensive sectors, like utilities and REITs, and the industrials (blame Brent oil\u2019s surge through $70/bbl for weakness in the airlines) have been clear laggards.  The market\u2019s move to the upside was on relatively decent volumes too. They were the second highest on the consolidated tape this month, and a major bounce back from Monday, where we saw the second lowest number all year.  We closed near the high end of the S&P\u2019s recent range, just shy of resistance at ~2,660 (while support still holds at the 200-day moving average of ~2,596) and we could see further optimism creep back into the market if we can break above this mark.  Excuses to Fade the Rally  But something we\u2019ve become accustomed to lately is these huge swings to the upside followed by swift plunges in the opposite direction, so it\u2019s altogether possible that investors will be looking for any excuse to fade yesterday\u2019s move.  Perhaps day two of Zuckerberg\u2019s grilling (scheduled for 10am) doesn\u2019t elicit the same response as day one, and the FAANGs, the semis, and the rest of tech fade hard -- Goldman is already out slashing estimates on chip darling NVDA and sell-rated AMD, with both stocks down ~1% in pre-market trading.  Maybe the latest headlines tied to Mueller, or the Cohen raid, or possible action in Syria will spill over into the market. Or perhaps a scorching hot CPI print (today at 8:30am), after yesterday\u2019s firmer-than-expected PPI, and some eyebrow-raising language in the FOMC Minutes (at 2pm) might help to spook the tape.  Watch the BKX for clues as we\u2019re only two days away from the kickoff to bank earnings. And as for tech\u2019s next major non-Facebook catalyst, it\u2019ll be NFLX\u2019s earnings on Monday after the close. The sell-side has been aggressively bumping up numbers over the past few days, so expectations are riding high: Morgan Stanley yesterday gave bull case $440 on higher conviction, Goldman today raised price target to $360 on a likely beat, and many others making similar tweaks to their models.

The shares were down 2.1 percent Thursday as of 10:34 a.m. in New York, while the Nasdaq 100 climbed 0.5 percent.  Trump features again when it comes to Apple Inc. shares, which are more than 8 percent off their record high partly on concerns about the prospect of a trade war between the U.S. and China. In a worst-case scenario, the U.S. could impose a tariff that affects iPhones and other Chinese-manufactured electronics. And car accidents have roiled market darlings Tesla Inc. and Nvidia Corp.  Not to worry, say analysts, who\u2019ve flooded email inboxes with reports reaffirming a bullish stance on the broader industry. The bull case? Tech fundamentals remain strong and, for all the worry over privacy, fake news and tech power, the U.S. giants are still cranking out products that people want to buy.  Facebook is sitting on a pile of cash so big that fines equaling the largest corporate penalties ever would amount to less than 7 percent of it. Alongside Google, its online dominance is so complete that there are few alternatives for users or advertisers.  Scarred, Intact  \u201cThey\u2019ll come out bruised and scarred but they\u2019ll come out intact,\u201d said James Cakmak, an analyst at Monness Crespi Hardt & Co. who has maintained his buy rating and $210 price target on Facebook. \u201cRadio and TV aren\u2019t the future, we know that, digital is. And it\u2019s not going to affect the direction of the dollars, which is toward Google and Facebook. The question is what is the speed that they get there.\u201d  The damage to all these stocks over the past couple weeks remains contained if viewed through a wider lens. Even after Tuesday\u2019s 7 percent rout, Nvidia\u2019s stock is double where it was a year ago. Tesla, while losing almost a fifth of its value this year, is still up sevenfold from the start of 2013.  Analyst estimates and fund flows show few signs of panic. In fact, profit forecasts for the tech industry have been barely changed over the past two weeks despite the market turmoil. At 30 percent, the expected pace of growth exceeds all but one industry in the S&P 500 Index.  Investors in ETFs seem in no rush to bail. Take the PowerShares QQQ Trust Series, the biggest fund tracking the Nasdaq 100. Outflows peaked around $2 billion on March 19 and trickled down to less than one-tenth of that amount Tuesday, a day when Nasdaq companies lost $260 billion in market value.  \u201cTech has given us more than it has taken away,\u201d said Kim Forrest, senior portfolio manager at Fort Pitt Capital Group LLC in Pittsburgh. \u201cThe future is going to have more connected devices.\u201d  \u2014 With assistance by Tom Giles", "stock": "NVDA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-28", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-28/in-precarious-moment-for-tech-stocks-are-still-finding-friends"}, {"article": "Facebook added to losses in high-flying tech peers on Monday. But today, they\u2019re standing strong.  Apple Inc., Netflix Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. are up at least 0.5 percent, compared with Facebook Inc.\u2019s dip of as much as 6.2 percent. The social media company has lost 12 percent this week, its biggest two-day retreat since 2012, based on closing prices.  News that a company linked to President Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign may have collected data from Facebook users without permission sparked concern that the social media giant -- and potentially its peers -- could face increased regulatory scrutiny. Investors seem to be mostly shrugging off this concern, at least for now. Shares of Facebook have been under pressure for months amid concern over the company\u2019s role in Russian meddling in the 2016 election, even as its peers in the FANG Index of tech megacaps managed to withstand the pressure.  \u201cWhile the last two days were exceedingly harsh, the stock has been losing ground on a relative basis for quite some time,\u201d said Frank Cappelleri, senior equity trader at Instinet LLC. \u201cWhat if Facebook continues to struggle but the rest of the market can shrug it off? That\u2019s just a question to consider.\u201d  A Congressional official familiar with the matter said Facebook tentatively agreed to brief House Judiciary members as early as Wednesday over the use of Facebook users\u2019 personal data by Cambridge Analytica, a firm hired as a consultant to Trump\u2019s campaign. The news helped the Nasdaq 100 Index erase earlier gains and briefly trade in the red. This compares with a 1.1 percent gain in Netflix, a 2.5 percent jump in Nvidia Corp. and a 2 percent rally in Amazon. Twitter Inc., facing its own potential regulatory scrutiny in Israel, fell 9.6% in its worst day since July.  What if tighter regulation spreads to market darlings like Amazon and Netflix? To Michael Purves, chief global strategist at Weeden & Co., it could force investors to rotate out of the group that has grown in strides, partly because of the absence of any regulatory pressure. To London Capital Group\u2019s Jasper Lawler, the potential regulation of tech megacaps will make investors question whether the group, which jumped twice as much as the S&P 500 Index last year, is still a smart purchase.  \u201cThe tech giant\u2019s fast-and-loose handing of private data will feed the niggling doubt investors have had all along that the big U.S. tech stocks cannot keep going up so rapidly forever,\u201d said Jasper Lawler, London Capital Group\u2019s head of research. \u201cLooking further out, legal action and greater industry regulation are huge headwinds \u2018the Zuck\u2019 has to contend with.\u201d  \u2014 With assistance by Stephen Sweeney", "stock": "NVDA", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-20", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-20/not-my-problem-tech-stocks-decouple-from-facebook-as-woes-mount"}, {"article": "Among those making heavy bets on technology stocks during the sector\u2019s worst week in nearly eight years were quant funds.  As of Wednesday, firms that use technology and formulas to automate the investment process had their highest gross exposure to the sector on record, according to Credit Suisse Group AG prime services data going back to 2013. At 18.4 percent, the measure of firms\u2019 long and short positioning was nearly 2 percentage points higher than for February.  Technology Overload Quant funds have boosted tech stock exposure 2 percentage points since start of year Source: Credit Suisse Services Risk Advisory  Quants on the Credit Suisse platform are roughly defined as funds that invest in thousands of equities and trade based on patterns, rather than making stock-specific bets.  It\u2019s mounting evidence that investors following some of the most popular quantitative strategies -- such as momentum investing -- are heavily concentrated in technology. Over the past year, chipmakers Micron Technology Inc. and Nvidia Corp. alone accounted for more than a tenth of gains in the Bloomberg pure U.S. momentum index, which tracks stocks that have gained the most over the past year.  Yet if quant investors had stepped in Wednesday programmed to expect dip-buying, they found no such luck. Following the funds\u2019 peak in technology exposure, the stocks fell about 5 percent to trade at the lowest in more than a month. For the week, global tech shares fell 7.3 percent.  On Monday, the stocks rallied back, with chipmakers among the biggest gainers in the S&P 500 Index.  As for fundamental managers, equity long-short hedge funds tracked by Credit Suisse maintained their elevated technology exposure, at about 22 percent of total holdings. Overall, equity managers appeared largely unmoved by last week\u2019s bout of selling, according to Mark Connors, the head of risk advisory at the Swiss bank.  \u201cStable equity gross and net positioning across most equity managers indicates recent volatility has not prompted unwinds at this point,\u201d Connors wrote in a Friday note. \u201cThe currently odd mix of hedge fund positioning reflects neither concern of further risk-off, nor longer-term optimism regarding global growth.\u201d", "stock": "NVDA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-26", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-26/quants-footprint-in-tech-hit-record-just-as-selloff-accelerated"}, {"article": "Investors in technology shares are concerned that the industry could be the next victim of the Trump administration\u2019s increasingly combative stance toward global trade partners.  While Donald Trump\u2019s broadsides this week against what he deemed unfair trade practices focused on industrial metals, comments he made over the past couple of months about the tech industry indicate it could soon come in for targeting as well. In January, Trump said the U.S. was considering a fine on China because it had forced U.S. companies to share their intellectual property as a cost of doing business there. Then in his first State of the Union address, Trump pledged \u201cstrong enforcement\u201d of U.S. rules that protect business secrets.  Those warnings are now sounding more ominous to investors concerned about a trade war between the world\u2019s two biggest economies.  Chris Krueger, an analyst at Cowen Washington Research, notes that semiconductors are one of six \u201ccore industries\u201d in Trump\u2019s America First agenda, along with steel, aluminum, vehicles, aircraft and shipbuilding. He said a U.S. Trade Representative report on forced technology transfers by China may come in a matter of weeks, way before the official Aug. 18 deadline, and could recommend tariffs or bans on Chinese investment or joint ventures.  If Trump does decide to crack down on intellectual property theft, U.S.-based semiconductor companies that have Chinese customers or factories in China could get caught in the crossfire. China is the largest market for the chip industry and if it were to retaliate some U.S. companies may suffer.  \u201cReciprocity on the part of China in IP crackdowns could have a substantial effect on manufacturing and IP of companies,\u201d said Matt Larson, a Bloomberg Intelligence litigation analyst.  One sector high-flier with significant China exposure, Nvidia Corp., had been up 25 percent year-to-date. It sold off as much as 5.7 percent yesterday after Trump made his steel tariff comments, and is dropped as far as 4.5 percent today before recovering. The move over the past two days is worse than the broader market selloff of about 2 percent, reflecting the concern about a Trump tech crackdown.

Quantitative investors have long used liquidity signals to strengthen their automated models. Simply put, bets on the least traded stocks should, in theory, outperform the market because there\u2019s a reward for taking on the extra liquidity risk.  But since December the opposite has been occurring, with the most liquid stocks rewarding investors to the greatest degree in nine years.  In normal times, heavily traded shares don\u2019t overlap much with momentum stocks. Reliable companies carry the market higher without any frenzied buying or selling. Amazon.com Inc., for example, has one of the lowest turnover ratios in the S&P 500 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Yet in a long-short Bloomberg index that bets on the most actively traded stocks, a hefty chipmaker presence has the gauge headed toward its best month since 2009. That semiconductor shares are rising so quickly despite a high turnover is an ominous signal, indicating that trigger-happy, short-term investors are wading into momentum, according to Vitali Kalesnik, head of equity research at Research Affiliates LLC.  Pure Panic  \u201cWhen you see very strong momentum combined with a sharp rise in trading volume, that can serve as a signal of overheating and speculative behavior,\u201d Kalesnik said by phone.\u201cThe issue with speculator money is they can come in and drive prices up and once they see signs of something happening, they quickly leave and drag prices down.\u201d  Nvidia Corp., VMware Inc. and Micron Technology Inc. hold the biggest positions in the Bloomberg trade activity portfolio, and have gained as much as 22 percent in January alone. But the potential for sharp reversals was put on display Wednesday, when semiconductor stocks in the S&P 500 tumbled 2.4 percent, the most in seven weeks, on the heels of a disappointing earnings report from Texas Instruments Inc.  The only other instances of liquid share outperformance occurred when equities began to recover from the bear market lows in 2002 and 2009. But the difference is that in those periods this was a healthy sign because the most beaten up shares had been oversold during the downturn, enabling them to outperform off those lows when the market rebounded, according to Joseph Mezrich, head of U.S. quantitative analysis at Nomura Instinet LLC.  This time, gains in the most liquid shares are pointing to pure panic, he said.  \u201cWhat you\u2019re observing is a panicked market,\u201d Mezrich said. \u201cYou have people panicking to get into these stocks because of a fear of missing out.

Trump had a few biting tweets out over the weekend, including one lashing out at the EU (\"we will simply apply a Tax on their Cars which freely pour into the U.S.\") and another about the state of America\u2019s steel and aluminum industry (\"Sorry, it\u2019s time for a change!\"). Meanwhile, Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro made it clear that there are no country exemptions to the tariffs, even for U.S. allies like Canada and Great Britain.  Major company-specific news from the weekend include a wrench thrown into Broadcom\u2019s $117 billion bid for Qualcomm (CFIUS issuing an order to delay tomorrow\u2019s vote) and reinsurer M&A with France\u2019s Axa buying XL Group for more than $15 billion, the largest-ever European acquisition of a U.S. insurer.  The market\u2019s focus has shifted quickly from inflation fears, and what the Fed is going to do about it, to the potential for an all-out trade war, and whether the threat from Trump is real or if he is testing the waters to gauge sentiment. The market will be paying close attention over the next few days to retaliatory efforts from the rest of the world, as well as Trump\u2019s next steps: Will he lob more insults at our trade partners? Will he ratchet up the call to exit Nafta (as talks come to a close tomorrow)? Will he clarify or walk the stiff tariff levels back?  Until now, stocks haven\u2019t felt too much of an impact from the recent noise out of D.C., of which there has been plenty over the past week or so. For example, the confusion over what to do about gun control, Lindsay Graham calling for a war with North Korea, Jared Kushner losing top security clearance, Hope Hicks resigning, The Mooch getting banned, and swirling speculation of key point people in the administration taking their leave, from Gary Cohn and H.R. McMaster to John Kelly and Jeff Sessions.  But given the recent shock from the tariff announcement as well as how the calendar is shaping up (we won\u2019t get a major inflationary datapoint until Friday\u2019s jobs & wage hike data), we should expect traders to pay much closer attention to the headlines coming out of the Trump administration in the near term. This is especially true if the rumors get louder about someone like Cohn throwing in the towel.  Scenario #1: Trump Escalates Trade War Fears  Here is what could happen if Trump doesn\u2019t back down on his tariff call (25% on imported steel, 10% on foreign aluminum) and keeps the potential for a trade war very broad by targeting the entire world instead of singling out a country like China:  Steel and aluminum stocks resume their vicious rally from last Thursday, when Trump shockingly introduced the tariffs: CLF surged 10%, AKS +9.5%, CENX +7.5%, X +5.8%, STLD +4%, and so on  NAFTA-exposed names take it further on the chin as the market turns sour on the prospects for a renegotiated pact; this would include the rails (especially KSU and the Canadians like CNI and CP), the autos (GM, FCAU, etc) and the auto parts companies (like MGA and LEA)  Semiconductors with exposure to China (NVDA, MU, AMD, INTC) could come under further pressure given read-across to some of Trump\u2019s past comments on the tech industry and whether he may decide to crack down on alleged intellectual property theft  Watch for rotation into small caps (Russell 2000 clear outperformer in past two sessions) and sectors that are more insulated to a potential trade war like biotechs (IBB ETF up 2.4% on Friday) and the banks  Focus on single-name stocks that have low exposure to a trade war; on Friday, Fundstrat\u2019s Tom Lee put out a bullish buy-the-dip note on equities where he listed 20 stocks that fit the bill given low export as percent of sales and low international sourcing as percent of COGS; included HSY, MSI, and a bunch of energy and healthcare names like EOG, HES, PXD, ALXN, AMGN, BIIB, and GILD  And some will just stick with what has worked, for example NFLX (which rose 5.3% last week to completely shrug off any weakness in FAANG or the SPX) and AMZN (which was flat last week); these two are up 57% and 28% year-to-date, respectively  Scenario #2: Trade War Fears Are Scaled Back  Here\u2019s what might happen if Trump caves in from all of the negativity surrounding the tariff announcement and walks back some of his comments from last week:  We\u2019ll likely see a reversal in some of the actions mentioned above, for example the metal stocks pare some of their tariff-fueled gains while the Nafta names, especially the autos, catch a relief rally  Expect strength in names that got hit late last week on speculation of how the tariffs might crimp margins, for instance heavy machinery like CAT, DE, TEX, MTW and truck machinery like CMI and PCAR Sidenote: Truck machinery names got some good news late Friday night after preliminary Class 8 data for February showed elevated demand (positive for CMI, PCAR, and NAV)  May also see outperformance in HOG, which got caught in the crossfire of potential retaliation from the EU  Tick-by-Tick Guide to Today\u2019s Actionable Events", "stock": "NVDA", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-05", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-05/here-s-how-to-trade-trump-s-next-trade-war-tweet-taking-stock"}, {"article": "Megacap tech shares slumped again Wednesday as pessimism about the sector showed few signs of letting up.

There's no U.S. firm more at risk from trade retaliation.  If there's a poster child for the tonic the current U.S. government has delivered to the country's corporate sector, it's Boeing Co.  Fueled by Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg's cozy relationship with President Donald Trump, orders for Super Hornet fighter jets and corporate tax cuts, its 146 percent share-price increase since election day in 2016 has outpaced every other company on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.    Thursday's 3.5 percent fall after Trump tweeted out plans to impose tariffs on metal imports should be a warning sign that, beyond the current clear skies, a storm is building.  One obvious risk is increased costs. About 80 percent of an aircraft's weight is aluminum, and Trump's promise to slap levies of 10 percent on imports of that metal represents a pricing handicap in Muilenburg's endless battle for market share with Airbus SE.  Flying High Boeing has put in by far the best share-price performance of any company on the Dow since Trump's election Source: Bloomberg  At the same time, that blow is likely to be cushioned by the fact that managing raw-materials costs is part and parcel of being a manufacturer. Aluminum prices have risen or fallen by 10 percent or more in all but eight of the past 30 years. Boeing, moreover, isn't a major buyer of aluminum straight from the pot: Most of its supply comes from Arconic Inc., the specialty-products half of the old Alcoa Corp. business. Shares of Arconic slipped 1.5 percent on Thursday, an indication it's expected to take part of the hit.  The bigger risk depends on how the coming days and months are handled.  There's probably no U.S. firm more at risk of trade retaliation from China than Boeing. Of the 10 American businesses that declare more than $5 billion of sales in the country, three -- Apple Inc., Las Vegas Sands Corp. and Procter & Gamble Co. -- are dependent on consumer spending, so probably somewhat immune to government diktats. Six more are in the semiconductor and tech businesses that China wants to encourage domestically, so they should also enjoy a degree of protection. Against that backdrop, Boeing stands out like a sore thumb.  Odd One Out Boeing is the only non-consumer, non-tech U.S. company that declares more than $5 billion in revenue from China Source: Bloomberg  Most of its biggest customers in China are state-owned airlines and lessors affiliated with government-controlled banks. The few independent players could easily be leaned on by authorities to defer existing orders.  China Inc. has a sound self-interested rationale for pursuing an aggressive path. Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China Ltd., or Comac, is hoping to pitch its C919 jet as a home-grown competitor to Boeing's 737 and Airbus's A320, and announced last month it would make its first delivery in 2021.  Using a trade war to put one of the C919's rivals on the back foot seems the perfect way to crack open the Boeing-Airbus duopoly and advance the interests of China's own manufacturers. Should the current tit-for-tat over steel and aluminum spiral toward a trade war, few firms will find themselves in a more precarious position than Boeing.

The latest financing will bankroll investments in parallel fields such as autonomous driving and augmented reality, cover the growing cost of AI talent and shore up its computing power. It\u2019s developing a service code-named \u201cViper\u201d to parse data from thousands of live camera feeds -- a platform it hopes will prove invaluable in mass surveillance. And it\u2019s already in talks to raise another round of funds and targeting a valuation of more than $4.5 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.  \u201cWe\u2019re going to explore several new strategic directions and that\u2019s why we shall spend more money on building infrastructure,\u201d SenseTime co-founder Xu Li said in an interview. The company turned profitable in 2017 and wants to grow its workforce by a third to 2,000 by the end of this year. \u201cFor the past three years the average revenue growth has been 400 percent.\u201d  Read more: China\u2019s Plan for World Domination in AI Isn\u2019t So Crazy After All  AI Supremacy China houses some of the world's largest privately backed artificial intelligence startups Source: CB Insights, Bloomberg  Alibaba, the e-commerce giant that\u2019s also the country\u2019s biggest cloud service provider, could help with its enormous infrastructure needs. SenseTime plans to build at least five supercomputers in top-tier cities over the coming year to drive Viper and other services. As envisioned, it streams thousands of live feeds into a single system that\u2019re automatically processed and tagged, via devices from office face-scanners to ATMs and traffic cameras (so long as the resolution is high enough). The ultimate goal is to juggle 100,000 feeds simultaneously.  Police can use Viper to track everything from vice and accidents to suspects on blacklists. While civil libertarians say such systems have been used to track activists and oppress minorities in places like the Western region of Xinjiang, Xu believes the technology is essential and deployed in various ways by authorities around the world. China\u2019s police forces and surveillance footage are also important sources of training data for SenseTime\u2019s image recognition systems -- it claims to work with 40 city authorities in the country.  \u201cIt will not affect privacy because only authorized persons can access it,\u201d he said.  SenseTime claims some 400 clients and partners including Qualcomm, chipmaker Nvidia Corp. and smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp. For 2018, it\u2019s projecting several billion yuan in revenues, Xu said. The startup\u2019s expanding its reach across augmented reality, popularized by services like Snapchat that impose digital stickers and images on the real world. And it\u2019s working with Honda Motor Co. to develop autonomous driving systems and is in talks to work with health institutions.  \u201cIn China there is an advantage in areas like facial recognition because of the privacy that exists in the U.S. and elsewhere in the EU, and some of the very best facial recognition technology in the world that I\u2019ve seen is in China,\u201d said Breyer Capital founder Jim Breyer, an indirect investor in SenseTime through IDG.  SenseTime is the largest, according to CB Insights, of a plethora of private AI outfits. Fellow facial-recognition startup Megvii Inc. raised $460 million last year, while smaller niche players from Yitu to Malong Technologies have also won funding. A key partner, Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology, is one of the world\u2019s biggest suppliers of security cameras and developing its own competing AI technology.  Xu says its ability to work across wide datasets and diverse products sets it apart from rivals. \u201cWhat is difficult is if you\u2019re dealing with different video streams in different formats,\u201d he said. While the company has long considered an initial public offering, Xu said those plans are on hold pending rules that facilitate tech listings in mainland China.  \u201cWe are still waiting for a fixed rule to come up with a new strategy,\u201d he said. \u201cProbably not this year.\u201d  \u2014 With assistance by David Ramli", "stock": "NVDA", "label": 1, "date": "2018-04-09", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-09/sensetime-snags-alibaba-funding-at-a-record-3-billion-valuation"}, {"article": "REUTERS/Steve Marcus  Nvidia's stock is rising after reporting an across the board beat on earnings.

Since January 1, bitcoin has fallen 35% while the total market for cryptocurrencies has lost 30% of its value, or roughly $182 billion.  \"With crypto likely contributing larger-than-expected revenue, it is unclear if Q1 will be flattish next quarter,\u201d RBC Capital Markets analyst Mitch Steves said in a note to clients following Nvidia\u2019s record fourth quarter earnings release.  \"We think it is still doable without material crypto exposure given that GPUs are difficult to purchase due to pent-up gaming demand.\"  Despite the fears, Steves maintains an outperform rating for shares of Nvidia, with a target price of $280 \u2014 22% above where the stock was trading early Tuesday.

Cryptocurrencies have provided Nvidia, and other chipmakers, with a big boost to their top line in recent quarters.  Crypto miners have been buying up huge swaths of GPUs as the prices of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies skyrocketed. The huge demand drained Nvidia's supply chains and sent the prices of the cards soaring in secondary markets. All of this extra demand is estimated to have boosted Nvidia's revenue in the fourth quarter, but that leaves Nvidia with a big problem as it looks to report earnings on Thursday.  \"We think the Company will need to see material Outperformance to see appreciation on the print (largely due to near-term run-up),\" Mitch Steves, an analyst at RBC, said in a note to clients on Tuesday.

The company can't just report overall revenue growth, it will have to show that it's growing revenue outside of its graphics division because the boost from crypto could eventually disappear as prices of cryptocurrencies fluctuate and interest wanes.  AMD, Nvidia's main rival in the GPU space, saw its shares plummet about 6% immediately after reporting an across-the-board beat on earnings. AMD said it got a 5-6% boost in annual revenue in 2017, and said about 1/3 of its growth in its graphics and computing division was from increased GPU demand from cryptocurrencies, which wasn't enough for investors watching the earnings.

Citron Research and Goldman Sachs both recently expressed concerns over how much Nvidia has risen over the past year because of enthusiasm around crypto demand, leading Citron to lower its price target and Goldman to remove the stock from its conviction list. Both firms are still bullish on Nvidia in the long term.  Steves thinks new data center chips will revitalize growth in that unit. Nvidia is also working on more partnerships for its autonomous driving chips that should improve sales as more automakers release cars with self-driving capabilities, even if they are initially limited. These two units are potential growth areas that Nvidia could highlight in its earnings to show it's not just a crypto mining company.

The stock is down 1.52% to $236.84 after Goldman Sachs removed Nvidia from its conviction list, and Citron said the stock is about to drop about 15% to $200.  The two firms are both concerned about how red-hot Nvidia shares have been recently. Shares have been on a meteoric tear over the last year, gaining 104.31%, as revenues grew just 11%. In 2018, stock has posted a 16.74% gain, which Citron thinks is too much.  \"Is Nvidia really worth $36 billion more than it was New Years Eve with $15k BTC?\" Citron asked on Twitter. Nvidia has gotten a boost from cryptocurrency miners buying huge numbers of graphics cards to speed up their rigs, especially as the price of bitcoin hit its high of nearly $20,000 in December. Prices have come crashing down to just under $9,000, which could mean demand from miners could wane.  Citron and Goldman both fear the boost Nvidia has seen from cryptocurrency mining is unsustainable and unreliable as a way to grow sales. Goldman said it could lead to volatile earnings as Wall Street struggles to find concrete ways to predict the demand of the crypto market.  For context, during its recent earnings call, AMD's leadership said crypto mining added about $300 million in revenue, or about 5-6%, in 2017. Nvidia is set to report its earnings, and its boost from crypto mining, on February 8.  Crypto isn't the only worry for Nvidia, though.  The company's data center business was just starting when Goldman added the stock to its conviction list in late 2016. Since then, it's exploded as artificial intelligence and cloud computing have become the hottest new trend in enterprise computing. The sector is now better understood, which means more players are starting to nip at the heels of Nvidia's dominance, according to Citron.  Citron said that Nvidia used to be the only player in AI and autonomous driving computing, but is facing stiff competition in both categories going into 2018.  While both Goldman and Citron criticize the company and predict a more difficult 2018, the firms agree that Nvidia is still at the top of its game.

Nvidia's chips for power infotainment systems and self-driving cars are off to a slow start, but the company could just be a bit too far ahead of the curve, Steves said.

When the D.M.V. opened the mailed application on Friday, it called the company to confirm, a department spokeswoman said, and Uber asked to withdraw the request. The D.M.V. asked for the withdrawal in writing, and it received an email on Saturday.  Uber has said it is cooperating with investigations by the Tempe police, the National Transportation Safety Board and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. None of the investigations have determined whether Uber was at fault in the crash.  The intense focus on the accident has also prompted Uber\u2019s suppliers to evaluate its technology. On Tuesday, a spokesman for Nvidia, a supplier of semiconductors and other computer hardware used in Uber\u2019s autonomous vehicles, said it was suspending its tests of self-driving cars on public roads in order to \u201clearn from the Uber incident.\u201d The price of Nvidia shares fell 8 percent on the news.  Uber has not said when it plans to resume testing its autonomous vehicles. The bulk of Uber\u2019s testing was in Arizona, but it was also driving autonomous vehicles on roads in San Francisco, Pittsburgh and Toronto. Alexis Campbell, a community relations manager for Pennsylvania\u2019s Department of Transportation, said it would work with Uber to ensure that safety was the top priority if tested was restarted in the state.

In 2016, Uber started testing its self-driving cars in San Francisco without a permit, arguing that one wasn\u2019t necessary because a safety driver was monitoring the vehicles.  The D.M.V. disagreed and ordered Uber to apply for a permit. When Uber refused, the department revoked the registrations for the 16 cars that Uber was testing in the city.  After California revoked the registrations, Mr. Ducey said Arizona welcomed Uber\u2019s cars with \u201copen arms and wide open roads.\u201d In a public showing, Uber loaded its cars onto a truck and hauled them to Arizona.

And as we\u2019ve seen after previous fervors, investors can take a long time to regain their faith.  Facebook is down 20 percent from its recent high. Most of the slide came after news reports showing how the company\u2019s data was misused. Investors have to grapple with the possibility that Facebook won\u2019t be sharing as much data as it does, undermining its ability to generate ever-increasing amounts of advertising revenue.  Nvidia, a computer chip maker intent on being a leader in automated driving technology, is off 12 percent from its recent high. The company said on Tuesday that it would halt tests of its autonomous driving technology on public roads after an Uber self-driving car hit and killed a pedestrian in Arizona.  Tesla is not a tech stock, but it is included in the FANG+ index, and its supporters believe deeply in its power to revolutionize the auto industry. Growing fears about Tesla\u2019s ability to finance its expansion have helped drag its stock down 33 percent from its recent high. Ominously, the price of Tesla\u2019s bonds is also falling, signaling that the company is losing the confidence of creditors.  Of course, on their march higher, tech stocks overcame obstacles, like management problems at Uber and the poor performance of Snap\u2019s initial public offering.  But the latest problems have raised deeper, broader doubts, and that may keep the uncertainty around longer. Investors have viewed automated driving technology as a huge potential source of growth for some companies. But after the Uber incident in Arizona, those companies may take a more realistic look at what they have to spend to create a technology that is efficient and safe, and conclude that they have to pull out of the race or pare back. Users of social media and regulators may prevent social media companies from sharing so much of their data with advertisers, and that could restrain revenue growth.  And if the passion for two or three big tech companies wanes, the cooling may spread.  \u2014 Peter Eavis  Amazon has shed more than $50 billion in market value.  The reason?  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Reports that President Trump wants to rein in the e-commerce giant.  Jonathan Swan of Axios, citing anonymous sources, reported:  \u201cTrump has talked about changing Amazon\u2019s tax treatment because he\u2019s worried about mom-and-pop retailers being put out of business.\u201d  Mr. Swan added:  \u201cTrump\u2019s wealthy friends tell him Amazon is destroying their businesses. His real estate buddies tell him \u2014 and he agrees \u2014 that Amazon is killing shopping malls and brick-and-mortar retailers.\u201d  Shares of Amazon have tumbled more than 7 percent at one point Wednesday, but they pared those losses after a White House official told Reuters there were no specific policy changes related to Amazon being considered at the moment. But the official added that the administration is always looking at different options on a range of policy issues.  How concerned should investors be?  GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives writes:  \u201cWhile it\u2019s now a hand holding time for Amazon given this new regulatory potential threat, we believe the reality of these worries altering the company\u2019s business model and future tax structure are low and we would be buyers of the name on weakness.\u201d  Guess which companies are benefiting from Amazon's woes? Retailers, the FT points out.  On a day when the stocks on Wall Street are flat, Macy\u2019s was up 3.5 percent, J.C. Penney has gained 5.5 percent, Walmart rose 1.7 percent, Target increased 1.8 percent, and Kohl\u2019s was up 2.4 percent.  Photo  Are investors waking up to Tesla\u2019s real problem?  The electric carmaker\u2019s shares are down 7 percent Wednesday, after plunging 8 percent on Tuesday.  Tuesday\u2019s slide was driven, in part, by the National Transportation Safety Board\u2019s announcement that it was investigating a fatal crash last week involving a Tesla vehicle in California. News that Jaguar Land Rover was teaming up with Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Waymo unit probably didn't help either.  But the continued decline in Tesla\u2019s stock \u2014 its shares are down more than 20 percent since mid-March \u2014 speaks to the bigger concern surrounding Tesla: How it funds itself.  Investors have grown increasingly worried as Tesla burns through cash and struggles to meet its own production goals for the Model 3. Late Tuesday, Moody\u2019s downgraded Tesla\u2019s credit rating further into junk territory and said its outlook on the company is negative. The credit ratings agency cited production delays and said Tesla may soon need to raise more than $2 billion.  Those concerns can be seen not just in Tesla\u2019s stock price but also in the trading of its debt. The FT points out that \u201cTesla\u2019s eight-year bond maturing in 2025 traded on Wednesday at 87.6 cents to the dollar, the lowest since issuance. The yield has surged to 7.5 percent from 6.59 percent on Monday.\u201d  Liam Denning of Bloomberg Gadfly writes:  \u201cChallenges on the factory floor and the balance sheet are converging. Drawing inexorably closer to a refinancing wall, Tesla needs a real shot of confidence, and capital, to keep its money machine turning over this year. \u201cGiven Tuesday\u2019s bond blowout, that almost certainly means tapping the equity market again. Nothing like being a motivated seller to put a floor under a stock price, right?\u201d  Is Twitter vulnerable to privacy regulation?  The fallout from Facebook\u2019s Cambridge Analytica scandal has spread to Twitter.  The stock tumbled 12 percent Tuesday after Citron Research\u2019s Andrew Left said he was betting against the social media company because of its vulnerability to regulation around how it handles user data.  But analysts at Barclays disagree. They argue in a recent note to clients that Twitter\u2019s data business likely won\u2019t be impacted much by any regulation on its use of user data.

Photo  Why the first Trump trade deal may not lead to others  President Trump has scored a significant trade deal with South Korea.  But with Mr. Trump preparing to meet with North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un \u2014 who just took an armored train trip to Beijing \u2014 and the North apparently pressing on with nuclear developments, an \u201cAmerica first\u201d trade stance was far from the only thing pushing the South to sign. More from Michael D. Shear and Alan Rappeport:  The political success of the trade agreement \u2014 and its ability to be replicated in other negotiations \u2014 is not guaranteed. Many countries have reacted coolly to Washington\u2019s pugilistic approach to trade, viewing the president\u2019s preference to punch first and negotiate later as counter to global interests.  The Trump administration continues to ramp up its trade rhetoric with China. Unidentified sources told Bloomberg that it is considering invoking an emergency law to restrict Chinese investments in sensitive U.S. tech. A separate plan to enact tariffs on $60 billion of Chinese goods has left companies wondering which industries will be targeted. Other Asian countries increasingly fear being caught in the crossfire of a trade war, the WSJ reports.  And nations are already reacting to Trump\u2019s trade moves, erecting barriers to stop the steel and aluminum that faces tariffs in the U.S. being dumped in their markets.

NVDA -1.32% is scheduled to announce earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter after the market closes Thursday. Here\u2019s what to look for:  EARNINGS FORECAST: Analysts expect Nvidia to report per-share earnings of $1.16 cents, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters, up 17% from the same quarter a year earlier.  REVENUE FORECAST: Analysts expect total revenue of $2.68 billion for the quarter, up 23% from a year earlier.  WHAT TO WATCH:  CHIPS FOR AI: Sales to giant internet companies are the biggest driver of Nvidia\u2019s stock, analysts say. Customers like Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com and Microsoft Corp. have been buying up the company\u2019s graphics chips to drive artificial-intelligence calculations that help them, for instance, auto-tag objects in photos. Data-center growth, which has increased by double digits from quarter to quarter for most of the last two years, declined to 2% in the second quarter, then rebounded to 20% in the third. Investors will be looking for sustained momentum, said analyst Mitch Steves of RBC Capital Markets LLC. He\u2019s looking for mid-single to double-digit sequential growth in data-center sales.  CRYPTOCURRENCY MINING: Miners of electronic currencies like Ethereum have embraced graphics cards to speed up calculations that unearth the digital coins. But such sales, which Nvidia reports in its gaming and OEM segments, are a double-edged sword for the company, analysts said: They\u2019ve been bringing in substantial revenue in recent quarters, but they might disappear if the vogue for cryptocurrency mining wanes. \u201cNvidia has played down importance of crypto because they know it can be fickle depending on the price of the currency, and they want to support their fan base among gamers,\u201d said Stifel Financial Corp. analyst Kevin Cassidy. It is hard to differentiate between online sales to gamers and purchases by miners, he said, but investors will be looking for clues to crypto-related revenue in the quarter and beyond.  NEXT-GEN GAMING CARDS: Sales of gaming gear account for more than half of Nvidia\u2019s annual revenue, propelled by new products. The company has been shipping data-center chips based on its Volta design in significant volume since last summer, but it hasn\u2019t said on when, or even whether, it will roll out gaming cards based on the new architecture. \u201cThe timing is something people will be curious about because it should provide a decent tailwind,\u201d said analyst Blayne Curtis of Barclays PLC.

NVDA -1.32% , which has made a broad push to bring its computing platform into self-driving cars, said Tuesday it will temporarily halt testing of its driverless technology on public roads following the fatal crash of an Uber Technologies Inc. autonomous vehicle.  The company said its suspension involves its own fleet of test cars, which are being driven on public roads in California and New Jersey.  Uber has also used Nvidia\u2019s computing technology in its Volvo XC90 SUVs, the same type of vehicle that struck a pedestrian on March 18 in Tempe, Ariz. The two companies in January officially announced that Uber selected Nvidia\u2019s artificial-intelligence computing system for its fleet of self-driving cars and freight trucks. Nvidia\u2019s chips and software help robot cars instantly crunch the vast amounts of data from sensors and cameras to make split-second decisions.  It isn\u2019t clear if Nvidia\u2019s technology was in the car that struck 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg, who later died of her injuries.  \u201cMost self-driving vehicle prototypes and test vehicles use Nvidia technology,\u201d an Nvidia spokesman said in a statement. \u201cIn some case, customers are developing their own software and we don\u2019t have details of their algorithms.\u201d The spokesman said Nvidia is seeking to find out more details on Uber\u2019s configuration and software.  An Uber spokeswoman declined to comment on the matter.  Police said the Uber vehicle was traveling at about 40 miles an hour and didn\u2019t brake before hitting Ms. Herzberg, who was crossing her bike outside of a crosswalk. Specialists in autonomous technology said the car\u2019s sensors should have detected Ms. Herzberg, and that the car\u2019s artificial-intelligence system should have understood she was a pedestrian.  Following the crash, Uber said it was temporarily suspending testing of its self-driving cars in four cities as investigators studied the incident. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey on Monday barred Uber from testing its cars in the state. At least one auto maker, Toyota Motor Corp. , decided to temporarily halt public testing of its own self-driving vehicles.  Nvidia, a graphics-chip specialist that lately has become the leader in chips for artificial intelligence, said in a prepared statement it was temporarily suspending tests \u201cto learn from the Uber incident.\u201d Its fleet of cars for data collection, which are driven by human drivers, will continue to operate.  Nvidia\u2019s stock was recently down more than 7% to $226.39 on Tuesday following the company\u2019s announcement, which was reported earlier by Reuters.  Nvidia has made big bets on developing artificial intelligence for self-driving cars, and competes head-to-head with Intel Corp. in developing autonomous technology. The company said Tuesday it is working with 370 companies on autonomous vehicle technology, including auto makers such as Audi AG , Daimler AG , Toyota, Volkswagen AG and Volvo Group.  Nvidia has emphasized safety in its autonomous-vehicle program. On Tuesday, the chip maker introduced a system for training self-driving cars using simulation rather than real-world driving of the type that resulted in the fatality in Arizona.  That system feeds computer-generated imagery into the company\u2019s automotive brain, as though the car were viewing the world through cameras and other sensors. The brain\u2019s reactions feed back into the simulator, which alters its imagery accordingly. The technology allows self-driving cars to encounter particular hazards any number of times so they can fine-tune their responses, the company said, ultimately improving their handling of real-world conditions.  In January, Nvidia announced that its self-driving car platform met the international safety standard known as ISO 26262, including features such as redundant functions in case one part of a system fails.

It\u2019s everything else.  Such was illustrated well on Tuesday when a late-market selloff hit the technology sector particularly hard. The Nasdaq Composite slid nearly 3%\u2014double the loss of the Dow. And the selling hit every segment, from internet companies to chip makers to software providers. Even Apple , AAPL 0.34% which kicked off the day with a cheery event designed to showcase new iPad and other offerings for the education market, shed 2.6% by the close.

It isn\u2019t clear if that vehicle was using Nvidia\u2019s chip products, and these chips are just a small part of its business, but the news still cast a pall over the stock.  For Facebook, the selloff came on news that CEO Mark Zuckerberg will testify before Congress about the social network\u2019s handling of user data. That would be an ignominious milestone for the 33-year-old billionaire, and raises fears about government regulation for the company.

Above, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang speaks at CES earlier this year. Photo: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg News  Nvidia NVDA -1.32% and Facebook are two very different companies. But both have recently come to learn a painful lesson: When tech is everywhere, so are the risks.  Facebook, of course, has been battered over its handling of user data. Nvidia\u2019s challenges are very different. The company, whose main business is making chips for videogames, has spent the past couple of years aggressively building chips designed to run self-driving cars. This has led to partnerships with several auto makers as well as companies like Uber, which has been developing its own fleet of autonomous vehicles.  But the problem with putting tech in the driver\u2019s seat is that the buck tends to stop there as well. One of Uber\u2019s self-driving cars was involved in a fatal accident on March 18. Nvidia\u2019s technology wasn\u2019t blamed for the incident, and CEO Jensen Huang said late Wednesday that Uber doesn\u2019t even use the company\u2019s self-driving car system.  But Nvidia still elected to temporarily suspend tests of the vehicles using its platform while investigating the matter. That has meant a lot of bucks for Nvidia\u2019s investors. The highflying stock has shed 12%\u2014nearly $18 billion in market value\u2014since the accident.  Nvidia still generates most of its sales from graphics chips used in videogames. But the company\u2019s significant advancements with artificial intelligence has opened the door to new and expansive opportunities. Companies like Google, Microsoft and Amazon are snapping up Nvidia\u2019s chips to deploy artificial intelligence capabilities in their data centers. Nvidia\u2019s sales into this segment more than doubled in the fiscal year ended January and are expected to surge more than 60% this year to about $3.2 billion. The company also told analysts on Tuesday that it now sees its total addressable market in this space as being worth about $50 billion in the next five years.  The opportunity for self-driving cars is further out. Nvidia is projected to get 5% of its total revenue from autos in the next two years, but much of that will come from infotainment systems, not autonomous vehicles. But while that may limit the actual business risk, Nvidia\u2019s name is now closely synced to the development of autonomous cars. That means mishaps involving those types of cars will likely weigh on the company\u2019s shares.  That is far different from Facebook, whose core business is under fire. Yet both stocks have fallen sharply over the past two weeks. Nvidia\u2019s was hit so hard in part because its market value has doubled over the past year.  That has put the chipmaker\u2019s value on par with that of much-larger tech names like IBM . Nvidia also is one of the more expensive chip stocks on the market at 35 times forward earnings, though its rapidly expanding bottom line has moderated that valuation a bit. The company\u2019s record to this point suggests it can still deliver on some outsize expectations. But investors should be ready for new twists in the road.

Nvidia announced it was temporarily halting road tests of its driverless-car technology following a fatal crash. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg will testify before Congress about the social network\u2019s handling of user data. Tech stocks have been on a long winning streak on strong demand for hardware, software and services. But the sector\u2019s growing clout over everyday life also raises the risks of what can go wrong, writes Dan Gallagher for WSJ Heard on the Street.  Highflying technology stocks have been ignoring rising threats for a while, writes WSJ\u2019s James Mackintosh in his Streetwise column. The market is waking up to the broader threat of politics. It might also be sniffing another danger, from economics.  Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix\u2019s sales pitch was simple and powerful: his firm\u2019s personality-profiling ability would let politicians win votes by tapping into people\u2019s deepest fears and desires. Clients of the company, including Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, said Cambridge Analytica struggled to make good on Nix\u2019s bold claims.  Europe\u2019s economic boom and its increasingly stable politics have fulfilled investors\u2019 deepest wishes over the last year. All bar one: European stocks haven\u2019t made them a single euro. In the past 12 months, the Stoxx Europe 600 has delivered a 1% loss in local-currency terms, accounting for both share-price appreciation and dividends.  Shares in Shire spiked as much as 20% on the news that Japan\u2019s Takeda Pharmaceutical was considering making an offer for the $40 billion drugmaker. Takeda said it hasn\u2019t approached Shire\u2019s board and the proposal is at a \u2018preliminary and exploratory\u2019 stage. But it added a deal could create a global biopharmaceutical leader and balance its geographic focus.  The Bank of England said that companies relying on European Union passporting rights to provide financial services in the UK will be able to continue doing so for the duration of the prospective Brexit implementation period.  As investors increasingly turn to low-fee, so-called passive funds that track an index, one leader of a global fund company says actively managed funds should learn from a company that makes vacuum cleaners.

Amazon, the worst-hit stock on the S&P 500, is on pace to close in correction territory, according to the WSJ\u2019s Market Data Group.

The logo for Twitter, which fell more than Facebook on Tuesday, on a phone post at the New York Stock Exchange in 2015. Photo: Richard Drew/Associated Press  The highflying technology stocks had been ignoring rising threats for a while. Reality reasserted itself on Tuesday.  The immediate cause for plummeting tech shares was company-specific: Chip maker Nvidia Corp. NVDA -1.32% halted road tests of driverless vehicles after an Uber Technologies Inc. test car was involved in a fatal crash, and Facebook Inc. FB 0.40% CEO Mark Zuckerberg will be hauled before Congress. The announcements highlighted the risks to two of the biggest tech disruption themes, self-driving cars and social media.  But the market fall wasn\u2019t just about Facebook and Nvidia, or even self-driving cars and social media, although the themes mattered, with Tesla Inc. dropping more than Nvidia, and Twitter Inc. TWTR -0.83% losing more than Facebook.  Instead, the market is waking up to an even broader threat: politics. It might also be sniffing another danger, from economics.  The political risk is obvious for Facebook, which stands at the unpleasant intersection of privacy fears and fake news. Facebook is accused of unwittingly aiding the manipulation of the U.S. election by Russian agents, of helping swing the Brexit referendum and, linked to both cases, failing to notice that the personal details of 50 million users had been snatched.  The arguments about who, what, where and why are far from being resolved, but Facebook highlights the forces gathering against tech investors. Disruptive companies are bound to make powerful enemies in old industries, but the tech companies have alienated many natural supporters among the wider public through their swagger, wealth and tax avoidance. Businesses that were once beloved by consumers for taking on the corporate establishment have become the corporate establishment in the eyes of many of their customers.  Cities and states were first to flex their muscles, forcing companies such as Uber and Airbnb Inc. to follow local rules and pay taxes. The threats now are much bigger.  The European Commission is pushing for a 3% tax on the revenue of internet giants, while pressure is increasing for \u201cgig economy\u201d workers to be treated as employees. The rush by companies to pull their ads from Facebook may be merely temporary, but it shows just how far the social network has slumped in public opinion and how much privacy is becoming an issue for Americans. In Europe, privacy rules have just been tightened again.  There is also a backlash to the sheer scale of many of the big internet companies. Earnest discussion among economists about the new monopolies is unlikely to lead directly to government intervention, but a change in public perception makes antitrust action more likely. Again, Europe has been leading the way by taking on Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google.  There is a further danger, from the economy. A stronger economy should mean more companies are able to demonstrate rising sales. Investors who want growth will be able to buy businesses exposed to the economic cycle, and the fast-expanding tech companies will lose some of their exclusivity in the minds of shareholders. The same point can be seen by looking at interest rates. As rates rise, profits far in the future look less attractive, which should compress the valuation of disrupters reinvesting all their earnings in the hope of future returns. If\u2014and it is a big if\u2014you expect the economy to improve and bond yields to rise, disruptive tech stocks should be less appealing.  Tech stocks rode high in the past three years, ignoring all these concerns as investors focused on the extraordinary profits and dominant market shares many were producing. Sentiment was overly positive, and the backlash was ignored.  It isn\u2019t always true that highflying stocks fall further, but it certainly was on Tuesday. Out of the top 100 stocks in the S&P 500 for the year to Monday, 39 were in the bottom 100 on Tuesday, about double what would be expected by chance. It worked the other way, too, with just over one-third of the bottom 100 stocks for the year in the top 100 on Tuesday, led by General Electric Co. , the fifth-worst performer this year and the best on Tuesday.  In the short run, the drop means the overly fast upward momentum of the big tech stocks has abated, leaving them less exposed to further selling driven by technical factors, although Amazon.com Inc. led more falls on Wednesday after a report that President Donald Trump wants to target the company.  In the longer run, expect lots of contrition from tech company CEOs as they try to head off political pressure on the bottom line.

Two ETFs slated to launch Wednesday had to erase the word \u201cblockchain\u201d from their name after a last-minute intervention by the Securities and Exchange Commission, according to two ETF firms. The SEC insisted on the name changes amid a speculative frenzy for anything associated with bitcoin or blockchain, the technology behind the cryptocurrency.  \u201cYou can understand the SEC\u2019s point of view,\u201d said Eric Ervin, chief executive officer of Reality Shares, one of the firms that had to change the name of its ETF. \u201cThere are a lot of retail mom-and-pop investors buying anything blockchain without really understanding what\u2019s in it.\u201d  As a result of the SEC\u2019s prohibition, the Reality Shares Nasdaq Blockchain Economy ETF will be called the Reality Shares NexGen Economy ETF and the Amplify Blockchain Leaders ETF will instead be named the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF. The former will trade under the ticker BLCN, while the latter will use the symbol BLOK.  The SEC declined to comment.  The Amplify and Reality Shares ETFs plan to buy stock in companies that have invested in blockchain, such as International Business Machines, chip company Nvidia and financial companies such as J.P. Morgan Chase. Amplify\u2019s portfolio will be actively managed while Reality Shares will follow an index.  Several similar proposals from other ETF issuers may likewise have to revise their names. The SEC was concerned that using \u201cblockchain\u201d in the fund name could be misleading because many of the companies the ETFs will invest in don\u2019t get the bulk of their revenue from blockchain-related activities, said Christian Magoon, CEO of Amplify.  \u201cThe SEC\u2019s whole concern is protecting investors,\u201d said Mr. Magoon. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this phenomenon that has pushed up valuations of companies that put blockchain in their name or announce a blockchain ETFs.\u201d  One recent example is Eastman Kodak, whose stock price more than doubled Jan. 9 after the company announced that it would work with a partner to launch a digital currency.

Now investors are dealing with a new menace, and it\u2019s wreaking more havoc than anything in two years.  It\u2019s the bond market, where the biggest jump for interest rates since March has bulls questioning the staying power of an equity advance now seven months from being the longest ever. So drastic is the runup in yields that it\u2019s knocking stocks down during a period when analysts are pushing up earnings estimates four times faster than any time since 2012.  Looking at the week\u2019s drumbeat, you can\u2019t help but wonder, is this the start of something big? Warnings about valuations have been pouring forth from bears for so long that barely anyone listens anymore. With the S&P 500 up almost 50 percent in less than two years, some see the end of the blissfully easy money that equities have spewed out for 13 straight months.  For more on the equity selloff:  Everything\u2019s Expensive in Stocks Now Vulnerable to Lockstep Pain  Signs of Old Age Abound in a Bull Market Closing on History  It\u2019s Getting Hard for S&P 500 to Elude Bond Market Violence  One Indicator Says Bond Rout Going Too Fast for Stocks to Escape  \u201cIt\u2019s the turning point of volatility,\u201d said Jeffrey Schulze, chief investment strategist at Clearbridge Investments, which manages $137 billion. \u201cWe were all very fortunate to go through a year like 2017. But there\u2019s a number of different dynamics this year that will make volatility more part of the equation than it has been in quite some time.\u201d  \u201cBut it\u2019s definitely not the end of the bull market,\u201d Schulze said. \u201cIn order to see the end of the bull market, you need to see the U.S. go into a recession. We have an economic dashboard at Clearbridge, 12 variables that have done a very good job of foreshadowing an economic downturn. Out of the 12 variables, only one of them is flashing any type of caution.\u201d  When Friday\u2019s dust cleared, the S&P 500 was down 2.1 percent on the day to 2,762.13, and 3.9 percent for the week -- the most since January 2016. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 665.75 points to 25,520.96, bringing its total points lost over five days to 1,095.75. The Nasdaq 100 Index fell 3.7 percent for the week while the Cboe Volatility Index surged 56 percent.  The most significant feature of this selloff has been its breadth. While past declines in the U.S. stock market have been notable for their narrowness -- when one industry fell, another rose -- this time there\u2019s been no cushion. All 11 industries in the S&P 500 declined in the last week, something that hasn\u2019t happened since the month of Donald Trump\u2019s election.  Selling has also been spread among asset classes. A simple comparison that adds up percentage losses in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF and iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF showed a concerted selloff that was the worst since January 2009.  The swoons are taking a toll on one of the most popular asset allocation strategies: those lumped together under the rubric of 60/40 mutual funds. Among 35 such funds that have at least $1 billion in assets, all suffered losses during the week. Their decline averaged 1.2 percent, the most since September 2016, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  A big concern for investors is the timing of the rout -- the middle of earnings season, a calendar period that for the last six years has a nearly perfect record of boosting stocks. Bulls hoping for a broader celebration of brisk iPhone X demand at Apple or surging holiday sales Amazon.com were disappointed. Even the seventh straight weekly upgrades to S&P 500 earnings estimates was no help.  To be sure, even a decline such as this week\u2019s is barely notable in a stock chart that goes back more than a few months. The S&P 500 just had its best January since 1997, stocks from Nvidia to Boeing Co. to Vertex Pharmaceuticals all came close to doubling last year, and turbulence as measured by the average level of the VIX was never lower than it was in 2017. Friday\u2019s downdraft came on a day the Labor Department said U.S. employers added 200,000 jobs and unemployment held at a 17-year low.  \u201cThe underlying strength of the economy is still healthy. The overall level of interest rates is still quite low. If anything, we\u2019re surprised that it took so long for us to get a 3, 5 percent correction in the market,\u201d said Evan Brown, New York-based director of asset allocation on the investment solutions team at UBS Asset Management, which oversees $776 billion. \u201cThis is a healthy repricing of bonds and equities, and not a signal of something dire.\u201d  At the same time, a lot that looks straightforwardly good for investors could be framed as bad. Buying stocks when unemployment is this low and consumer confidence this high hasn\u2019t been a great bet: Four of the last five peaks in the S&P 500 came after the jobless rate fell to between 50 and 100 basis points below 4.5 percent, data compiled by Credit Suisse Group AG show.  The past year\u2019s rally has also attracted a category of investors whose enthusiasm isn\u2019t always welcome: individuals. Client activity at TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. hit a record as the number of daily trades surged almost 50 percent in the past year. At E*Trade Financial Corp., the number of trades from which a broker can generate revenue is the highest ever.  \u201cThe list of growing challenges have caught up to stocks,\u201d said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Weeden Capital Management LLC. \u201cWe probably need a valuation correction for both stocks and bonds to be more appropriately priced for an economy now growing at 3% real/5% nominal at full employment with rising labor costs and capital costs.\u201d", "stock": "NVDA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-02", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-02/stocks-in-rate-wringer-with-rout-raising-existential-questions"}, {"article": "Broadcom Ltd. is continuing to wage psychological warfare against Qualcomm Inc., but that may not win it a deal.  In response to Qualcomm raising its bid for NXP Semiconductors NV, Broadcom on Wednesday lowered its own offer for Qualcomm by $3 a share to $79. Broadcom justified the reduced price by lambasting Qualcomm's increased proposal for NXP as a \"transfer of value\" away from Qualcomm shareholders. It conveniently ignores the fact that the stock market transferred more value into NXP shares amid better-than-expected results and rising stock prices for its peers.  Topped Off Shares of semiconductor companies have soared since Qualcomm agreed to buy NXP, making its previous offer an effective cap on the share price Source: Bloomberg  This reads like a last-ditch effort to make Qualcomm management look bad and try to save face on a takeover proposal that has limited odds of succeeding. What's particularly telling is Broadcom's decision to leave the proposed reverse-termination fee at $8 billion. That likely wasn't enough for a deal between just Qualcomm and Broadcom. Mixing NXP into this amalgamation of companies -- which Broadcom is allegedly doing with the lower offer -- adds significant antitrust risks that shareholders aren't compensated for in this latest proposal.  Qualcomm investors are set to vote March 6 on Broadcom's proposed board slate. It's hard to see how they would be comfortable with this kind of regulatory risk. Odds are they don't hate the NXP deal as much as Broadcom does, either. Qualcomm shares climbed 6.3 percent when its talks with NXP were first reported and another 2.8 percent the day the deal was announced -- a rare feat for an acquirer.    Even at the raised price, Qualcomm says the merger should boost fiscal 2019 adjusted earnings per share by $1.50. Susquehanna International Group analyst Christopher Rolland estimates that may be more like $1.30-plus on more than $700 million of synergies. Either way, that's pretty good.  The NXP deal will diversify Qualcomm away from the slowing smartphone market and the licensing business that's given it so many legal headaches. As far as a backup plan to a Broadcom sale goes, the company could have done a lot worse. Obviously, Qualcomm investors would have preferred not having to raise the price for NXP, but they are smart enough to realize that the valuation case had moved against them and that feisty NXP shareholders like Elliott Management Corp. weren't going away. Those investors actually wanted more than what Qualcomm ended up giving them. At the very least, it seems unlikely Qualcomm holders are going to be cool with Broadcom assigning essentially negative value to a $46 billion acquisition.  That brings us to the delicate point in the deal machinations when it's time to consider Broadcom's future if it doesn't buy Qualcomm. Broadcom was doing well before all this drama, thanks in part to CEO Hock Tan's iconoclastic view of how to run a computer chip business. He hasn't skimped on research and development costs, but has chosen to focus on a few areas of expertise, rather than splurge to diversify into new areas. It's a more financially minded point of view than is typical in the chip industry, which has tended to be led by engineers.  Finding the Future Broadcom's spending on research and development is in the same range as Intel and Nvidia Source: Bloomberg  But the other essential part of Tan's playbook -- using acquisitions to grow the business and generate cost-cutting opportunities -- may be harder to achieve should this Qualcomm pursuit fail. After a multiyear spree of dealmaking both by Tan and the wider chip industry, he risks running out of appealing targets that are large enough to move the needle. It's the same problem that's bedeviled fellow famed cost-cutter 3G Capital, the Brazilian investment firm that backs Kraft Heinz Co. and Burger King.  Should Broadcom lose its battle for Qualcomm, it wouldn't be terribly surprising to see it try again at a later date. Tan has done a good job of zeroing in on investors' frustrations with Qualcomm's current management team and its legally challenged licensing business. If we fast forward a few years and Qualcomm is still going around in circles with its licensing business, or fails in some other way to meet its ambitious earnings targets, Broadcom will have even more leverage with shareholders. But in the current round of fighting, its latest move doesn't offer them much of an enticement.

Both don't have any fundamental technology that's crucial to their business, let alone something they stole from offshore.  What they do have is innovation, flexibility and the ability to develop new products at great speed whenever they spot a market opportunity. That's why they've become China's biggest companies by market value, at $532 billion for Tencent and $465 billion for Alibaba.  The pair's business models are also incredibly different. Alibaba gets most of its money from advertising, not e-commerce, whereas Tencent's WeChat has only just started tapping the ad market.  Alipay and WeChat Pay are good examples of how they stand out. No Western company has achieved even a sliver of what these products have managed. Mobile payments are ubiquitous in China in a way that makes the U.S. look like it's stuck in the Stone Age.

Equate Jack Ma's empire to that of Amazon if you like, but first tell me about Amazon Pay. Tencent's version, meanwhile, came from WeChat, the most powerful communications tool in China. No company worldwide has come close to the depth and breadth of WeChat usage.  Exhibit A: WhatsApp. Bought by Facebook Inc. for $19 billion four years ago, Mark Zuckerberg has barely done anything with it. Don't blame Chinese censorship and protectionism for the fact that you can't book and pay for a doctor's appointment over WhatsApp.  Similar can be said not only for Alibaba but its affiliate Ant Financial, which has become a vehicle for money market investments, bill payments and loans. It's only recently there have been reports from the Wall Street Journal about Amazon considering offering checking accounts.  On hardware, people often accuse Chinese brands Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo and others of copying Apple Inc. That was once a valid observation. Xiaomi's business model is unique, though, and it has since gone on to develop its own designs based on technology developed and sold by U.S. companies.  It's also made a significant mark in India, which no Western smartphone company has managed. To complain that Chinese hardware vendors have the benefit of cheaper labor is a non-starter.

There's a reason Alibaba is buying an equity stake, but it's not that.  A mega IPO from the world's largest fintech unicorn? Don't bet on it.  Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. said Thursday it plans to acquire 33 percent of its affiliate Ant Financial in exchange for certain intellectual property rights. When the deal closes, the companies will end the profit-sharing arrangement by which Ant pays royalty and other fees equaling 37.5 percent of its pretax profit to Alibaba.  The news sparked speculation Alibaba may be planning to take Ant public. The owner of Alipay was last valued at $60 billion, making it the world's second-most-valuable startup after Uber Technologies Inc.  Not So Tiny Ant Financial is the world's second-largest unicorn after Uber, valued at $60 billion Source: Crunchbase  But a look at Ant's earnings doesn't make the case that it's ready for a share sale. In the quarter through Dec. 31, Alibaba received a payment of 193 million yuan ($31 million) from Ant, down from 2 billion yuan in the September period. That's a 90 percent drop. Alibaba said that subsidy payments to acquire new Alipay users were behind the decline.  Squashed Ant Financial's profit contribution to Alibaba tumbled in the December quarter Source: Alibaba company filings  The nagging question is why Alibaba is doing this now, when it's had the option to buy into Ant since 2014.  Ant's business is facing some challenges. My guess is Alibaba management can see this is a company that can't afford to be paying out 37.5 percent of pretax income in the form of a dividend. In taking an equity stake, it's lending a helping hand.  As I wrote in December, Ant must navigate an increasingly complex web of rules covering everything from micro loans to the billions of dollars of client money it holds in escrow. Regulators in China tend to leave flourishing sectors like fintech alone, until they don't -- then out comes the wooden paddle.  Until recently, micro lending was very lucrative. Ant's two micro-lending subsidiaries have over the past year packaged up thousands of consumer loans and sold them to institutional investors in the form of asset-backed securities. As a result, in the first nine months of 2017, one of the units, Jiebei, generated 5.3 billion yuan of operating profit on just 3.8 billion yuan of capital. According to Bernstein Research, consumer lending accounts for almost 20 percent of Ant's income.  Empire Building Ant's revenue streams span payments to consumer lending to insurance distribution Source: Bernstein Research  The milk in that cash cow turned sour in December, when Beijing said Ant couldn't issue ABS exceeding 2.3 times its total capital. Now, to grow its micro-lending business, Ant needs to inject cash. In mid-December, Ant raised Jiebei's registered capital to 12 billion yuan.  Other areas of Ant's empire are under pressure. Because of Alibaba's dominance in e-commerce, Ant holds billions of dollars of client money in escrow, on which it can earn substantial interest income. But 12 months ago, the People's Bank of China ruled that all third-party payment platforms must deposit 20 percent of those funds in non-interest-earning reserves at designated banks. That threshold may be raised to 50 percent this year. This easy money used to comprise about 17 percent of Ant's revenue.  Don't think I'm all down on this deal, however.  Were Ant to IPO, investors in Asia, and possibly beyond, would have a chance to buy into China's dominant mobile-payments provider. And while middle-class consumers may not want the cheap stuff on Alibaba's Taobao, no doubt we'll all be using Alipay one day for everything from train tickets in Hong Kong to taxis in Singapore and clothes shopping in Osaka.  U.S. investors have been advocating for years for an Ant IPO to unlock the so-called conglomerate discount. What they need is patience. Ant's financials may not be looking so rosy now but this is a company with huge potential. It could one day become even bigger than Alibaba itself. Now that would be a share sale worth waiting for.

Investors poring over the latest financials will salivate at the company raising its full-year revenue forecast, or finally swapping its profit-sharing agreement with Ant Financial for an actual equity stake. They're both important headline items, but they paper over a deeper change in Alibaba's strategy that could have a longer-term impact.

But marketing executives don't build AI, and ad spend doesn't produce technological breakthroughs -- in fact, it's often the other way around.  Alibaba is already China's king of e-commerce, yet there are plenty of Davids ready to slay this Goliath in both existing and new industry categories.

Maybe not. Investors are starting to lose enthusiasm for some of what Alibaba and Tencent are buying, at least in the so-called \"new retail\" space.  Disappointed Better Life's shares tumbled after Tencent and its e-commerce partner JD.com bought strategic stakes. Source: Bloomberg  The latest example is Better Life Commercial Chain Share Co., with a market cap of $2.4 billion.

Both deals were done at 17.11 yuan per share. But when Better Life resumed trading this week, its shares tumbled 8 percent in two days, against a broadly rising Shenzhen market.  The investor reaction when Alibaba bought 36 percent of Sun Art Retail Group Ltd. for $2.9 billion in November was muted, too.  Compare that with two years ago, when investors could hardly contain their excitement.  Suning.com Co., an electronics retailer, sold a 20 percent interest to Alibaba on Aug. 10, 2015, at 15.23 yuan per share -- a premium of only 5.8 percent to its average price the previous 20 trading days. That didn't stop Chinese investors pushing the stock up 40 percent in four days on speculation its backer would turn the store operator into a higher-margin, more valuable e-commerce proposition. Today, Suning is languishing at 12.37 yuan.  Perhaps people are finally realizing the tech giants may not have their affiliates' best interests at heart. Case in point: Last quarter, profits at Alibaba's \"equity investees\" (excluding Koubei Co., which helps people find restaurant deals) came in at only $105 million, not even 5 percent of the earnings at Jack Ma's flagship.  It may be that all Alibaba and Tencent want from their retail and logistics affiliates is data on shoppers and shippers.

Alibaba and affiliate Ant Small and Micro Financial Services Group Co. already owned about 43 percent of the startup\u2019s voting shares. Alibaba paid all cash in the deal and has acquired all the shares formerly held by Baidu Inc., according to a person familiar with the matter.

Ele.me -- which means \u201chungry yet?\u201d -- operates an army of delivery people on motorbikes across the country and is vying for supremacy in the local services industry with Meituan Dianping, a startup backed by Alibaba rival Tencent Holdings Ltd.

Alibaba is taking over longtime delivery affiliate Cainiao and putting money into warehouses. It has also made investments in traditional retailers, including department store chain Intime Retail Group Co. and China\u2019s largest operator of Walmart-style hypermarkets.  \"If the Ele.me distribution network is integrated with Cainiao it can become a more efficient asset and bring it to break-even quicker,\" said Kirk Boodry, an analyst with New Street Research.  Alibaba and Ant Financial were lagging behind Tencent and Meituan in terms of offline penetration, especially local services, said Counterpoint Research analyst Flora Tang.  \u201cOwnership of Ele.me is the fastest and most effective way for Alibaba to regain leadership position in this area to compete with Tencent,\u201d she said.  Baidu had ceded control of its own food-delivery unit to Ele.me last year as the startup and Meituan became the two biggest competitors in China\u2019s online food-delivery market.  Zhang Xuhao, Ele.me\u2019s founder, will become chairman of the company, while Wang Lei, vice president of Alibaba Group, will become chief executive officer of Ele.me, the company said.

China\u2019s biggest e-commerce company, which operates an esports business and is a sponsor of the Olympics Games through 2028, is pushing for soccer, car racing and other games to be endorsed as an official competitive sport, said Zhang Dazhong, chief executive officer of AliSports.  That move could bar some of the world\u2019s biggest titles from the Olympics, such as League of Legends and PlayerUnknown\u2019s Battlegrounds, which are both distributed by Alibaba\u2019s competitor Tencent Holdings Ltd. in China. Esports is becoming a big business, drawing spectators to huge arenas where competitors battle each other for prizes and glory. The industry is projected to reach $5 billion in annual revenue by 2020 from ticket sales, advertising, broadcast rights and merchandising, according to researcher Activate.  \u201cIn our communication with the Olympics committee, we\u2019ve come to have a better understanding of their values, which is to promote peace,\u201d Zhang said in a telephone interview. \u201cThat\u2019s why for the future development of esports, we will focus more on titles that are actually related to sports, instead of games that focus on violence and slaughter.\u201d  Alibaba, which is investing 300 million yuan ($47 million) in esports in the year through March, is hosting the World Electronic Sports Games this week, where the member of the International Olympic Committee will also attend to observe. The e-commerce giant teamed up with the Olympic Council of Asia to add esports to the 2017 Ashgabat Asian Indoor and Martial Arts Games and the 2018 Jakarta Asian Games.  Game producers will need to be willing to share their intellectual property for free at the events, and the titles need to have a large fan base, according to Zhang. Because of the fast-changing nature of online games, it would be best to review what titles to include and adjust the rules on an annual basis, instead of every four years, he said.  \u201cWe think as a third party esports organizer we\u2019re a better match for principles that the Olympics promotes, which is fairness,\u201d Zhang said, adding that Alibaba will boost its investment in its esports unit this year, without giving a specific amount. \u201cIf you\u2019re a games producer, you\u2019re suspected of only pushing your games for your own benefit.\u201d", "stock": "BABA", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-13", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-13/alibaba-endorses-esports-for-olympics-but-not-violent-games"}, {"article": "Tech startups are typically founded by young entrepreneurs with more passion than experience. This is as true in India as it is in Silicon Valley. Then there\u2019s Bigbasket, whose founders are veterans of the dotcom bust and mostly north of 50. Drawing on their successes and failures, they\u2019ve turned their six-year-old startup into India\u2019s biggest e-grocer and are taking on a host of competitors, including Amazon and brick-and-mortar chains operated by the nation\u2019s biggest conglomerates.  Bangalore-based Bigbasket delivers everyday cooking essentials like ghee (clarified butter), diced coconut and fragrant basmati rice, as well as 18,000 other items from bread to laundry detergent to eight million customers in 25 Indian cities. It\u2019s mostly targeting upwardly mobile young Indians keen to avoid traffic and the drudgery of supermarket runs. Last month, Bigbasket raised $300 million in an Alibaba-led round that valued the grocer at $950 million\u2014 just shy of unicorn status.  In a country where groceries account for half of the almost $1 trillion retail market, Bigbasket is using knowledge learned the hard way during the dotcom era (don\u2019t expand too quickly or use discounts to acquire shoppers) and latter-day innovation (putting vending machines inside apartment buildings; building a supply chain of competitively priced organic produce).  Founding members of Bigbasket. From left: VS Ramesh, Hari Menon, Vipul Parekh, Abhinay Choudhari and V.S. Sudhakar. Photographer: Samyukta Lakshmi/Bloomberg  \u201cWe want customers to get hooked, and make our service harder to replicate,\u201d says Hari Menon, 56, co-founder and chief executive officer. He, along with V.S. Sudhakar (58), Vipul Parekh (53), Abhinay Choudhari (47) and VS Ramesh (62), founded Bigbasket parent Supermarket Grocery Supplies Pvt, in December 2011 in a nondescript building in Bangalore\u2019s humming Indiranagar neighborhood.  Bigbasket's founders had their first brush with e-commerce back in 1999 when they started Fabmart.com to sell books, toys and groceries online. \u201cThose were the dial-up days, there were no payment gateways, and the internet user base was more hype than reality,\u201d recalls co-founder Sudhakar, standing in a Bigbasket warehouse where women shake soil from mounds of vegetables before packing them into ready-to-ship bundles. \u201cBack then, it\u2019d take 50 seconds for a page to download.\u201d  It didn\u2019t take the men long to realize that the world\u2014let alone India\u2014wasn\u2019t quite ready for online shopping, and they pivoted to physical stores under the name Fabmall. They soon merged with a brick & mortar grocery chain before getting acquired by another conglomerate. By 2006, the founders had sold out and begun angel investing.  In 2011, they were approached to regroup for an online grocery. Plenty of people told them to stay away from perishable produce in a country so obsessed with freshness that shoppers surreptitiously break okra tips and sink their fingernails into cucumbers. The founders pressed on all the same.  But their timing was propitious: smartphones were proliferating, broadband was becoming affordable, and online payments were in place. Even so, when they pitched the concept, venture firms kept bringing up Webvan, the Bay Area e-grocer that famously flamed out in 2001. The founders revised their pitch to make clear that enough had changed to make the venture viable, and eventually persuaded private equity investor Ascent Capital to put up $10 million.  Workers stock shelves at a Bigbasket warehouse in Bengaluru. Photographer: Samyukta Lakshmi/Bloomberg  Delivering fresh food is challenging everywhere, but India presents steeper obstacles. The country lacks a cooling infrastructure\u2014walk-in freezers, chill rooms, refrigerated trucks and so on. That precluded Bigbasket from buying produce directly from farms. So for the first year, every morning at 3:30, the founders visited a riotous wholesale fruits and vegetable market to buy produce, then picked up other items from a wholesaler. Eventually, Bigbasket put together its own refrigerated warehouses and a fleet of trucks. These moves let the company source the food more cheaply and eventually in 2016 led them to launch Express, a 90-minute delivery service for milk, eggs, bread and emergency supplies.  By investing in \u201cthe dysfunctional food and grocery supply chain,\u201d says Arvind Singhal, chairman of retail consultancy Technopak Advisors, \u201cBigbasket\u2019s managed to get a head start.\u201d  Still, there was a lot of competition, including LocalBanya, Sequoia-backed PepperTap and SoftBank-funded Grofers. (Of them, only Grofers is still standing.) To stay ahead, Bigbasket needed to invest in technology: web-connected, temperature-controlled trucks, GPS-traceable vans, inventory-optimizing algorithms. \u201cThe days of experimenting were over,\u201d says Parekh. \u201cWe needed to step on the pedal.\u201d This all cost money and by then venture firms were more willing to invest. Starting in the fall of 2014, Bigbasket began mopping up capital\u2014$35 million from Helion Venture Partners and Zodius Capital Advisors, $15 million from Bessemer Venture Partners, $150 million in a round led by Dubai-based Abraaj Group. By mid-2016, Bigbasket was in eight large Indian cities.  Then it was time to target smaller cities. To grab the attention of residents in burgs like Kanpur, Surat and Vijayawada, they recruited Bollywood star Shahrukh Khan as a spokesman. In one TV commercial, Khan lets shocked delivery boys in through the back door. When asked if he's the one who orders the groceries, Khan lowers his voice conspiratorially and says, \u201cThat's my role in the house.\u201d When they ask for his autograph, he says, \u201cYou'll be coming home every week from here on. We'll take a selfie next time.\u201d  Along the way, Bigbasket has constantly had to adapt to local conditions. Originally the company wanted one person to drive the trucks and carry the orders into homes. But the delivery boys (they\u2019re mostly male) didn\u2019t want to be seen as drivers because they\u2019re considered lower status in class-conscious India. So they had to hire one person for each job\u2014which turned out to be crucial because parking is scarce so the driver needs to circle the neighborhood. They also need backup workers on standby because delivery people and packers have a tendency to take time off to celebrate local cultural events. \u201cIf there\u2019s a festival, 30 delivery guys take off to their village and return after four days,\u201d Sudhakar says.  Workers bag and weigh bananas and red peppers. Photographer: Samyukta Lakshmi/Bloomberg  Attracting and keeping customers is a challenge for all e-commerce companies, and doubly so in India. Shopping habits vary widely from city to city and are deeply ingrained. So Bigbasket plies customers with samples: leafy greens in Mumbai, a rice called Sona Masoori in Bangalore. The company spent years figuring out how to achieve the ideal ripeness of bananas for its picky customers and devised exacting quality specifications for produce, including eight varieties of eggplant, and trained the sourcing team to meet them.  Customized software automatically guides drivers to their destinations, which the company says has helped it achieve a near-perfect on-time rate. Late deliveries earn customers a 10 percent discount. Missing items are refunded, plus 50 percent of whatever the item cost.  Seven hundred people handle customer complaints and answer 95 percent of calls within the third ring, Bigbasket says. Complaints range from missing items to delivery boys\u2019 hygiene. After getting one too many of these complaints, the founders mandated that their personnel wear clean shirts and open-toe sandals to suit the humid weather. \u201cA Bigbasket person visits a household an average 50 times a year so being presentable was supreme,\u201d Menon says.  A worker prepares a barcode sticker for a customer's order. Photographer: Samyukta Lakshmi/Bloomberg  Last year, the founders took stock of what they had achieved. Bigbasket was now in cities with a combined population of 150 million people, had good brand recall and was making money on each order. But, \u201cwe\u2019d barely scratched the surface of the cities we were already in,\u201d Menon says. \u201cIt was time to bring in a strategic partner.\u201d After initial conversations with Amazon, Walmart and others, the founders zeroed in on Alibaba, which runs a large online grocery business in China and has built its own delivery operations.  They\u2019re now preparing for the next phase of growth by plowing money into warehousing and delivery systems in the 25 cities to bring down delivery times to three hours. In two years, the plan is to double the range of products to 60,000 SKUs, and more than double the farmer base to 5,000, expand private label items and use Alibaba\u2019s muscle to source and import a range of merchandise to six times that of large-format supermarkets. \u201cA customer should be able to buy whatever he wants,\u201d Menon says.  Even as Amazon and local rival Flipkart push into groceries, Bigbasket\u2019s founders profess equanimity. Grocery is different from electronics or fashion and they\u2019re confident that strength in one category doesn\u2019t necessarily translate to another.Bigbasket is growing quickly and aims to double sales each year to hit $2 billion by 2020 to take the third spot in Indian retail. \u201cThey\u2019ve just gone past 100 meters in a 42-kilometer marathon,\u201d said Vishal Gupta, managing director of early investor Bessemer. \u201cThey have to hit the top spot and keep on running.\u201d", "stock": "BABA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-19", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-19/alibaba-backed-grocery-startup-battles-amazon-in-india"}, {"article": "Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. will invest another $2 billion in Lazada Group SA and install one of its most senior executives to run the business as it doubles its bet on Southeast Asia.

Morgan Stanley, Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. were among at least 10 banks that helped to make the so-called margin loan, which is guaranteed only by Softbank\u2019s Alibaba holding, said the people, who requested anonymity as the details aren\u2019t public. The deal won\u2019t be reflected in the Tokyo-based company\u2019s debt, which may help shield it from a ratings downgrade, and could help its plans to sell shares in a domestic subsidiary, the people said.  The participation of the world\u2019s biggest banks in the trade reflects their continued appetite for complex share-based trades linked to their most-prized clients even after banks lost more than $1 billion combined on a margin loan linked to Steinhoff International Holdings NV. The South African retailer has lost more than 90 percent of its market value following disclosures of accounting errors that dated back several years.  \u201cTo my knowledge, I would agree that $8 billion is the largest margin loan ever,\u201d said Bethany Knight, a former Deutsche Bank executive who now advises on equity derivatives at Riverside Risk Advisors LLC in New York. \u201cThere are only a handful of sizable margin loans due to the significant ownership stake needed in a large, liquid, public company.\u201d  SoftBank couldn\u2019t immediately be reached for comment. Shares in Alibaba fell 2.2 percent to $168.86 at 12.25 p.m. in New York.  BNP Paribas SA, Deutsche Bank AG, Nomura Holdings Inc., Societe Generale SA, UBS Group AG and ING Groep NV were among other lenders on the deal, the people said. Representatives for the banks either declined to comment or didn\u2019t return calls and emails.  The margin loan\u2019s interest rate is the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, plus about 150 basis points, or 1.5 percent, two of the people said. Softbank sold $2 billion of 10-year bonds last year that had a yield of 5.7 percent in London.  The margin loan may also remove an obstacle to the initial public offering of its domestic telecommunications unit SoftBank Corp., which had been used as collateral for its earlier debt, one of the people said. A successful IPO -- possible only after the division proves its independence by canceling debt guarantees -- could help the parent raise capital and relieve some of its debt burden, which reached 15.8 trillion yen ($147 billion) at the end of last year. A Tokyo listing could raise more than 2 trillion yen, people with knowledge of the matter said this year.  Masayoshi Son Photographer: Akio Kon/Bloomberg  Billionaire founder Masayoshi Son, who has said he aims for a listing within a year, is seeking to separate SoftBank\u2019s activities into investing and telecommunications arms as it branches out into businesses ranging from ride-hailing to insurance.  SoftBank Group\u2019s debt risk last month jumped to the highest in almost two years following a successful exchange of its dollar- and euro-denominated bonds for new securities, allowing the mobile-phone unit to release its loan guarantee. That swap eases the way for the IPO, prompting concern among bondholders that the unit\u2019s listing may reduce the amount of cash flow for the parent company.  In a margin loan, a borrower secures the debt by pledging an asset with the understanding that they\u2019d need to pay up if the value of the collateral declines. The lender can typically sell some of the collateral if the borrower is unable to provide the cash.

It wants to lead a round of funding that could value the Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.-backed company at $150 billion. The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg News reported on the deal Tuesday.

After leaving room for a profit at IPO and a public-trading bump, Temasek probably thinks Ant is worth at least $200 billion at listing, which means around $250 billion on public markets. That's a lot to ask.  In the final full year before its IPO, Alibaba generated $2.8 billion in net income attributable to ordinary shareholders. A survey of analysts came up with a valuation of $153 billion in March 2014, six months before the company's eventual debut. Alibaba closed on day one at $231 billion. Ant has produced a 13.2 billion yuan ($2.1 billion) profit over the past year, according to Bloomberg Gadfly calculations.

Three-and-a-half years later, it has a market cap of $454 billion. For Ant to follow the same trajectory it'll need to keep going deeper into the financial and personal lives of Chinese citizens, finding more ways to extract value in the form of commissions, fees or data.  Facebook Inc.'s Mark Zuckerberg was just schooled on the political risks of mishandling user information. And while China may view data privacy differently to the U.S., it would be a mistake to think the government takes a laissez-faire approach.  As fellow Gadfly Shuli Ren has pointed out, Ant faces numerous regulatory headwinds that cast doubt on the inevitability of any IPO. Competition, notably from Tencent Holdings Ltd., has also hurt, and contributed to a 90 percent drop in earnings in the December quarter after Ant spent big to lure new Alipay wallet users.  Unstable Ant Financial's earnings have been very up and down Source: Alibaba, Bloomberg Gadfly  Providing payments, credit scores and loans is also a more sensitive caper than selling toilet paper and televisions, which makes the very visible hand of the Chinese government one of Ant's biggest risks. There are several ways in which the People's Bank of China has rained on Ant's parade.  Even if Ant's profit rebounds, investors would be remiss to ignore these instabilities. Tencent provides stiffer competition to Ant than Alibaba ever faced as an e-commerce player in its pre-IPO days. And there are many other fintech firms ready to eat away at both giants.

Alibaba reported its earnings for its fiscal Q3 2018 (ended December 31, 2017), which showed that its revenue grew 56% year-over-year (YoY) to $12.8 billion, its highest ever. Its core commerce continues to be the bulk of its business, bringing in $11.3 billion in the quarter, which is up 57% YoY.  The huge revenue numbers are partially due to Alibaba's performance during Singles' Day, which set records itself.  Alibaba saw the gross merchandise value (GMV) that was handled through Alipay on its marketplaces reach $25.9 billion on Singles' Day, up 39% YoY. It credits much of the sales holiday's success to its logistics and payments capabilities, which helped process as many as 325,000 orders per second. This suggests that Alibaba's move to work with and upgrade approximately 600,000 smaller physical retailers for Singles' Day paid off. These locations served as delivery and storage locations for Alibaba, and were outfitted with technologies like facial-recognition payments, helping Alibaba handle the incredible level of consumer demand, and displaying the value that brick-and-mortar locations can have for Alibaba.

Additionally, it recently made a $2.9 billion investment in hypermarket operator Sun Art Retail Group for a 36% stake in the company. Alibaba says its investment in Sun Art is part of its preparations to expand its New Retail initiatives on a national scale, which could be a boon for the company.  The e-commerce competition between Alibaba and JD.com is set to spill into brick-and-mortar.

To be the first to know, please click here.  Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba upgraded the AI platform powering its Tmall Genie X1 smart speaker to include visual recognition capabilities, according to Ciol.  The AI platform, dubbed AliGenie 2.0, offers visual recognition capabilities via \"Genie FireEye,\" a new function in the Tmall Genie's mobile app. Consumers can attach their phones to a phone holder, called the \"Xholder,\" that's connected to the smart speaker, and then use their phone camera to scan items, which the device will recognize. It will then read aloud information associated with those items.  A robust AI platform with visual recognition capabilities could help Alibaba continue to grow its share of the global smart speaker market. Alibaba released the Tmall Genie X1 exclusively for the Chinese market in July 2017. It then captured 2.6% of the global smart speaker market in Q4 2017, making it the third-largest smart speaker vendor after Amazon and Google in terms of shipments, according to Strategy Analytics. The smart speaker is also the top-selling voice-controlled smart speaker in China, with 2 million units shipped since its release, and it's been connected to over 45 million smart home devices.  Bringing visual recognition to the Tmall Genie X1 is key to Alibaba's approach to the market. Alibaba is looking into retail, travel, and especially hospitality as areas for smart speaker growth, while its competitors are primarily focused on securing a place in the home for their smart speakers. With the new visual function, the Tmall Genie X1 will be able to scan and read over 40,000 medicine boxes, which could be crucial for individuals with visual impairments.  The device will also be capable of scanning book covers, and can currently read aloud over 117 books by Chinese publishers. Additionally, the Tmall Genie X1 will be able to interact with consumers through more than 20 simulated animations and facial expressions, allowing its users to enjoy an immersive experience that includes voice, visual, and touch interaction. Alibaba reportedly plans to implement facial recognition capabilities in a separate rollout to make the speaker even more engaging.  The addition of visual recognition to smart speakers marks the next logical step for vendors looking to expand use cases. The creation of new and immersive experiences with the addition of visual functions presents new avenues for businesses to interact with consumers, and will likely boost user engagement as a result. Visual interactive elements can also help businesses leveraging smart speakers to find new monetization structures, like visual-based advertisements and app subscriptions that are based on higher quality and more interactive experiences.", "stock": "BABA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-27", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/alibaba-adds-visual-recognition-to-its-smart-speaker-2018-3"}, {"article": "Ruben Sprich/Reuters  There's speculation that Alibaba is looking to buy out the remaining stake of Ele.me, its food delivery unit.  Ele.me already accounts for 50% of the online food delivery market in China, while its other competitor Meituan maintains roughly the other half in market share.  Watch Alibaba's stock price move in real time here.    With one deal, Alibaba could dominate the online food delivery market in China.  There are rumors the e-commerce giant is planning to acquire the remaining 68% stake of Ele.me, its food delivery unit, which will likely cost around $9.5 billion, according to a Jefferies note citing multiple media sources.  Alibaba's planned takeover could make it one side of a powerful duopoly in China. Ele.me makes up 50% of China's online food delivery market while rival Meituan controls 43.5%, according to Analysys International. The move puts Alibaba closer to cornering the Chinese online food delivery market.  China is the world's largest online grocery market, and it is projected to more than double its growth by 2020, according to IGD, an international grocery research organization. The industry delivered 80% year-over-year growth in 2017, wrote Jefferies' Karen Chan in a note.  China has seen online grocery growth soar because it has a higher population density, lower labor cost, a fragmented food and beverage market due to the higher number of small mom-and-pop shops with no logistics capacity, and a \"well-formed consumer habit\" thanks to subsidies, Chan said.  The acquisition of Ele.me could create synergies for Alibaba to move beyond food delivery, Chan added. It could help expand Alibaba's cross-channel traffic acquisition, Alipay's scale from loyal or high-frequency users, and \"strengthen\" its last-mile delivery under its \"New Retail\" initiatives, which the company hopes will further imbue brick-and-mortar stores with technology and e-commerce.  Last November, Alibaba acquired a 36% stake in the China's largest grocery operator, Sun Art Retail Group. Sun Art operates around 450 hypermarkets across China.

The talks were reportedly not CEO level, and they're not guaranteed to lead to any type of cooperation, but a potential partnership could hold a lot of value for both parties.  For Kroger, a partnership with Alibaba may help it revolutionize its e-commerce and in-store experiences. Alibaba has a number of technologies that would benefit Kroger if the partnership comes to fruition. And Kroger may have an interest in such innovations, as it recently embarked on its Restock Kroger initiative to improve its digital and omnichannel capabilities.  Alibaba has expertise in e-commerce, which means that it can both advise Kroger as it looks to revamp its digital offerings, and provide some of its algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI) to help Kroger better personalize its online shopping experience.  Brick-and-mortar has been a focus for Alibaba recently, and it's developed some in-store innovations that would be valuable to Kroger. Technology including in-store AI for recommendations, in-store data analytics, automated grocery delivery help, and more could all help Kroger's in-store operations and improve its performance.  Working with Kroger could give Alibaba the ability to sell more American goods or gain data on the US market. If the potential partnership results in Kroger selling products through Alibaba's marketplace in China, Alibaba would be offering more US goods to Chinese consumers, who are very interested in them, likely bringing in new sales. But if a deal sees Alibaba working with Kroger in the US-based retailer's stores, Alibaba would be able to collect data on US consumers, a market it's shown an interest in.  Regardless of whether they ink a deal, this meeting displays Alibaba's interest in expanding its relationship with US retailers and potentially entering the market.Previously, Alibaba has been building its relationships with US merchants, and even hosted a conference in Detroit to launch an initiative to help them sell to Chinese consumers. Meeting with Kroger may mean that Alibaba is looking to bring more retailers to its marketplace to get more cross-border sales, or it could be building up its partners to make an entrance into the US market. Working with Kroger would be a significant step in both directions.  Jonathan Camhi, research analyst for BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has laid out the case for why retailers must transition to an omnichannel fulfillment model, and the challenges complicating that transition for most companies. This omnichannel fulfillment report also detail the benefits and difficulties involved with specific omnichannel fulfillment services like click-and-collect, ship-to-store, and ship-from-store, providing examples of retailers that have experienced success and struggles with these methods. Lastly, it walks through the steps retailers need to take to optimize omnichannel fulfillment for lower costs and faster delivery times.  Here are some of the key takeaways from the report:  Brick-and-mortar retailers must cut delivery times and costs to meet online shoppers' expectations of free and fast shipping.  Omnichannel fulfillment services can help retailers achieve that goal while also keeping their stores relevant.  However, few retailers have mastered these services, which has led to increasing shipping costs eating into their profit margins.  In order to optimize costs and realize the full benefits of these omnichannel services, retailers must undertake costly and time-consuming transformations of their logistics, inventory, and store systems and operations.

Kroger could also be consulting with Alibaba about ways it can market and sell its products to Chinese consumers.  An outright acquisition would give Alibaba a physical-store footprint in the US that's about six times the size of Amazon's.  Alibaba could overtake Amazon's push into retail stores in one move.  The Chinese e-commerce giant is in talks with the supermarket chain Kroger about a potential partnership, a person with knowledge of the situation confirmed to Business Insider. This could take many forms:  Alibaba could be lobbying to get Kroger to accept Alipay, its online payment system. That would give Chinese tourists who are shopping in the US an easy way to check out at the nation's largest grocer.  Kroger could also be consulting with Alibaba about ways it can market and sell its products to Chinese consumers, like the warehouse chain Costco did in 2014.  Alibaba could outright acquire Kroger, which would give Alibaba access to the grocer's nearly 2,800 stores in the US.  A press release issued by the Chinese government last week and first noticed by the New York Post said Kroger and Alibaba were already working together.  \"Alibaba has teamed up with Kroger, Yintai, and RT-Mart to speed up the integration of online and offline sales,\" says the release on comments from an official with China's Ministry of Commerce.  The Post was also the first to report on the companies' discussions about forming an alliance.  An Alibaba spokesman said: \"Alibaba has dialogue with hundreds of businesses around the world every day about expanding commercial relationships and reaching Chinese consumers, and Kroger is an example of just that.\"  Kroger declined to comment.  Amazon shook up the grocery industry last year when it purchased Whole Foods for $13.7 billion. The deal represented Amazon's biggest commitment yet to physical retail, as the purchase included Whole Foods' nearly 500 stores.  A deal with Kroger could give Alibaba access to Kroger's nearly 2,800 US stores, the country's biggest network of traditional grocery stores, creating a physical-store footprint about six times the size of Amazon's.  'Kryptonite to Amazon Whole Foods and Walmart/Jet.com'  Kroger says it plans to add digital-shelf technology to nearly 200 stores this year. Kroger  Brittain Ladd, a Kroger consultant, wrote about the possibility of a Kroger-Alibaba partnership in a LinkedIn post published in June.  \"I believe Alibaba should acquire Kroger as a way to enter the USA, as well as extend and complement their global retail ecosystem,\" he wrote. \"A combined Kroger and Alibaba would prove to be Kryptonite to Amazon Whole Foods and Walmart/Jet.com, while adding substantial value to Kroger customers.\"  In the LinkedIn post, Ladd suggested that Kroger could license Alipay or launch Alibaba's Hema supermarkets in the US. Hema markets are similar to Amazon's cashier-less Amazon Go stores.  Kroger has been working on adding more digital features to its stores. The grocery chain is rolling out a new service called Scan, Bag, Go to 400 stores. It's designed to enable shoppers to scan their groceries with mobile phones or other handheld devices while they shop.  Eventually, Kroger says, the technology will also allow customers to pay for the items with their phones \u2014 which is where Alipay could come in.  Kroger says it also plans to add digital-shelf technology to nearly 200 stores this year. The technology, called Kroger Edge, is designed to replace paper price tags with digital displays showing a product's price and nutritional information, as well as video ads and coupons.", "stock": "BABA", "label": 1, "date": "2018-01-25", "source": "business-insider", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/a-kroger-alibaba-deal-could-thwart-amazons-whole-foods-ambitions-2018-1"}, {"article": "Jack Ma Ruben Sprich/Reuters  Alibaba founder Jack Ma called on Facebook to fix its privacy issues in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal.

Gideon Mendel/Corbis via Getty Images  Taobao, the Alibaba-backed online retailer, has launched a customized version of its app for elderly users.  China has 255 million people aged over 60, a largely untapped market potentially worth billions in revenue.  The company recently began recruiting for two elderly workers to improve its app for older users.  Nestle, IBM, and Apple have all begun targeting older consumers in China and Japan.  While most companies are still figuring out how to capture the millennial market, Taobao, the Alibaba-backed online retailer, has its focus set on China's growing population of senior citizens.  Last week the company launched an \"elderly-friendly\" version of its app that the company hopes will capture the attention of aging Chinese. There are currently 222 million people aged over 60 in China and, by 2020, that number is expected to hit 255 million\u2014 almost 20% of the country's population.  To gain access to this growing consumer base,Taobao's customized app is designed to be easier for older shoppers to use and can link straight to their children's account who have the \"pay-for-me\" option if they are inclined to cover their parents' purchase costs.  The customized app also displays a photo of their child on every page so users can easily share products or start a conversation via phone or text. Italso has a larger, less crowded interface, and uses more shortcuts for navigation.  \"By launching this simple and user-friendly option for the Taobao App, we will make online shopping easier for our senior citizens and help them stay connected with the younger generation and the community,\" said Ding Jian, Senior Product Manager at Taobao, who heads the development of this new channel, said in a statement emailed to Business Insider.  It's a sound financial move by Alibaba.  Last year, according to Taobao, shoppers over age 50 in China bought, on average, 44 products spending nearly $800 shopping online. Accounting for just senior citizens over 60 puts a possible total spend at around $200 billion a year.  Currently, Taobao has just 6 million users aged 60 to 69.Last month it began recruiting for two employees aged 60 or over who will work to get feedback from elderly users to improve the customized app.  But the company isn't alone in trying to tap the \"silver economy.\"  After Nestle previously launched a milk line for Chinese drinkers over age 50 and in Japan, where senior citizens account for more than a quarter of the population, Apple and IBM developed a modified iPad for the elderly which also had larger text, simpler interfaces and a modified FaceTime to easily speak to family.", "stock": "BABA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-06", "source": "business-insider", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/alibaba-targets-senior-citizen-consumers-2018-2"}, {"article": "DUBAI \u2014 A Dubai-based cryptocurrency company called Alibabacoin Foundation has rebuffed allegations of trademark infringement brought against it by the giant Chinese online retailer Alibaba Group Holding in a U.S. lawsuit last week.

In particular, it hopes to gather more detailed user data, which could help it offer more personalized services and ads to its customers online and off.  In that respect, the company has a head start on Amazon, which paid more than $13 billion for Whole Foods last year. In 2015, Alibaba struck a deal to buy a stake in Suning, an electronics retailer.

In December, it bought a stake in Yonghui Superstores, a large supermarket chain. It is weighing an investment in the China operations of Carrefour, the grocer and retailer headquartered in France.

As businesses and governments around the world look for ways to skirt the traditional news media, The Post has become a test case for how a new owner can co-opt an established brand to promote certain viewpoints. Alibaba executives say they want to present a \u201cfair and balanced\u201d alternative to foreign media, a mission statement that echoes Fox News.  Gary Liu, a Harvard-educated technology entrepreneur who is The Post\u2019s chief executive, said the newspaper could offer a more nuanced portrait of China than Western news outlets, with a staff of 350 journalists in Asia, including about 40 in the mainland.  \u201cWe are not here, certainly, to promote the views and wishes of Beijing,\u201d said Mr. Liu, who was previously chief executive of Digg, a news aggregation site in New York.

He said top editors routinely rewrote, played down or withheld critical stories for fear of offending influential Chinese officials or business executives.

Last year, The Post retracted a business column that suggested an investor in Hong Kong had ties to a trusted adviser to President Xi Jinping and had used his connections to amass wealth. The editors said the column made \u201cinsinuations beyond the facts.\u201d  Its author, Shirley Yam, a well-respected financial commentator, resigned. In a statement, Ms. Yam defended her column, saying that editors had vetted the piece extensively before its publication.

Mr. Gui was then quoted saying he had broken Chinese law and did not want help from the outside world.

The Post\u2019s leaders say that Alibaba executives, who have offices a few floors above the newsroom, are not involved in editorial decisions. But Mr. Tsai, the co-founder who spoke at the celebration last month, maintains a close connection, offering occasional feedback on coverage and new products.

Articles mentioning Alibaba reached an average of about 3.5 per day last year online and in print, roughly double the number in 2016, according to an archival search.

Traffic to The Post\u2019s website has roughly tripled over the past year, the company said. Alibaba made access free when it took over.  But Alibaba has abandoned ambitions of expanding the audience for The Post\u2019s journalism in the mainland, where its website is blocked. Even with its pro-China mission, articles in The Post still touch on topics that are off limits to mainland readers, like the 1989 Tiananmen massacre.

In 2014, Alibaba announced a \u201cfuture hospital\u201d plan intended to make treatment more efficient by allowing patients to consult with doctors online and order drugs via the internet. But two years later, Chinese regulators stopped the sale of over-the-counter drugs on Tmall, Alibaba\u2019s e-commerce website. They also suspended a drug-monitoring system that the company had created. And last year, the search engine company Baidu scrapped its internet health care service, which allowed patients to book doctors appointments through an app, in a bid to focus solely on A.I.  But some of the more recent initiatives have made inroads. Last year, Alibaba\u2019s health unit introduced A.I. software that can help interpret CT scans and an A.I. medical lab to help doctors make diagnoses. About a month later, Tencent unveiled Miying, a medical imaging program that helps doctors detect early signs of cancer, in the southwestern region of Guangxi. It is now used in nearly 100 hospitals across China.  Tencent has also invested in WeDoctor Group, which has opened its own take on Alibaba\u2019s \u201cfuture hospital\u201d in northwestern China.

Photo  The sheer size of China\u2019s population \u2014 nearly 1.4 billion people who could provide a vast number of images to feed into their systems \u2014 provides a potential advantage for the development of artificial intelligence. Also helping: China has fewer concerns about privacy, allowing for easier collection of data that could result in smarter and more efficient A.I. systems. Regulation here isn\u2019t as strict as in the United States, either.  In all, more than 130 companies are applying A.I. in ways that could increase the efficiency of China\u2019s health care system, according to Yiou Intelligence, an industry consultancy based in Beijing. They range from behemoths like Alibaba and Tencent to domestic champions iFlyTek, which invented a robot that passed a Chinese medical licensing exam, and an array of smaller start-ups.  Money is flowing in. As of last August, venture capitalists such as Sequoia and Matrix Partners had invested at least $2.7 billion in such businesses, according to Yiou. Analysts at Bernstein estimated that spending in China\u2019s health tech industry will reach $150 billion by 2020.  Behind this push is a realization that the country\u2019s health care system is in crisis. With no functioning primary care system, patients flock to hospitals in major cities, sometimes camping out overnight just to get treatment for a fever. Doctors are overworked, and reports of stabbings and assaults by frustrated patients and their relatives are not uncommon.

Yitu is working with Zhejiang Provincial People\u2019s Hospital, the best medical facility in eastern Zhejiang province, to develop software that automates the identification of early stages of lung cancer.  While it initially focused on facial recognition, Yitu has branched out into more complex image-recognition challenges, like cancer scans. Lin Chenxi, who left Alibaba to establish the company in 2012, said he hoped to use the technology to ensure equal access to medical treatment across China.  \u201cIn China, medical resources are very scarce and unequally distributed so that the top resources are concentrated in provincial capitals,\u201d he said. \u201cWith this system, if it can be used at hospitals in rural cities, then it will make the medical experience much better.\u201d  Trying to identify cancer nodes \u2014 shifting black-and-white splotches that look something like a Rorschach test \u2014 is grueling work, and China\u2019s doctors have far less time and resources than their counterparts in the United States and elsewhere. Gong Xiangyang, the head of the hospital\u2019s radiology department, likened the process to a factory, where burnout and mistakes from overwork can happen.  \u201cWe have to deal with a vast amount of medical images everyday,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we welcome technology if it can relieve the pressure while boosting efficiency and accuracy.\u201d", "stock": "BABA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-01-31", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/31/technology/amazon-china-health-care-ai.html"}, {"article": "Alibaba and Data  E-commerce was both an aspiration and a boogeyman. Amazon was often described in hushed tones; several exhibitors and speakers tried to avoid naming the online retailer at all.  But attendees packed a large hall on Tuesday to listen to an executive of Alibaba, a Chinese giant that many consider to be Amazon\u2019s chief rival, describe how Asian consumers are eager to make purchases enabled by technology.  China \u201cmay well become the first cashless society in the future,\u201d said Lee McCabe, vice president of Alibaba\u2019s North America operations. Shoppers in China largely accept Alibaba\u2019s voracious data collection, which allows the company to create detailed behavioral profiles across its many platforms.  Alibaba uses the information to help guide American brands like Mattel into China, Mr. McCabe said. To promote movies like \u201cA Dog\u2019s Purpose\u201d to an Asian audience, Alibaba \u201ctargeted everybody who likes Dennis Quaid movies, who likes dogs, who has watched a dog video\u201d using its vast trove of data, he said.  Artificial intelligence also plays heavily into Alibaba\u2019s strategy and is used to predict supply chain volatility and personalize marketing. It also handles 95 percent of the inquiries the company receives from its customers. The system recognizes when shoppers become emotional and should be transferred to a human representative, Mr. McCabe said.  Certain consumers will soon be able to test-drive or purchase vehicles without any human contact, using their mobile phones at a garage that doubles as a vending machine, he said. Alibaba will have reviewed their credit scores and deemed them able to afford a car.

All retailers, however, are grappling with an existential debate over what constitutes a store, according to the panel. Is it a marketing platform? A place to buy goods?  Many companies are experimenting with new tactics, including showrooms and pickup services. Alex Taussig, a partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners, called this experimentation the \u201creplatforming of retail.\u201d  \u201cThis is all rethinking what it means to have a store, and this is why I think the retail apocalypse is not evenly distributed,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are certain formats that will go away.\u201d  Consumers in Control  Shoppers \u201cused to be passive individuals in front of a shelf,\u201d Laurence Haziot, a global managing director at IBM, said during another panel.

Sexual misconduct in the workplace can take a devastating human toll. Moreover, the issue implicates gender equality and gender diversity concerns more broadly, and boards that include a meaningful proportion of female directors should be better positioned to address sexual harassment and gender equality issues.  Among the best ways to better address the issue at a company: having more women on corporate boards and in senior management positions.  \u2014 Michael J. de la Merced  The race is on to become the first United States company valued at $1 trillion.

A scary U.S. inflation print in February sent shares sliding and raised fears of four, rather than three, interest rate rises in 2018. Since then though, inflation has failed to spook markets the same way; worries about trade and Big Tech regulation have instead come to the fore. Next week, with U.S. CPI data due, markets may find themselves back thinking about price rises and wondering if those February fears were justified.  There is no sign yet of those fears resurfacing. Latest jobs data showed the United States created the fewest jobs in six months, even if higher wage gains signalled tight labour markets. Bond markets' inflation expectations gauge -- 10-year inflation breakeven rates -- extended a recent drop.  CPI next week is expected to be up 0.2 percent, the same as its as-consensus rise in February. That could soothe volatile stocks -- if earnings hold up and trade tensions abate.  U.S. jobs gains slowest in six months, wage growth picks up  U.S. TIPS breakeven rates extend fall as payrolls disappoint  (GRAPHIC: U.S. inflation https://reut.rs/2qc8gQG)  3/AFTER YOU!  Next week's March trade data from China will probably show the economy extending its impressive run-up in exports: it's too early to see any impact from the tit-for-tat tariff salvos the Trump administration and Beijing have been firing off in recent days. China's Feb exports rose 44.5 percent versus year-ago levels -- well above the forecast 13.6 percent gain -- and another strong print may evoke fresh ire from Trump.  Global stocks have been volatile but on the whole, seem to believe all this is just noise. Discerning equity investors with shares in Chinese tech giants Baidu, Tencent or Alibaba also know the Sino-U.S. trade balance vastly overstates China's direct stake in those exports, which include components from Taiwan, Korea and elsewhere in Asia. Which means that U.S. tariffs on Chinese telecoms and electronics are negative for Asia as a whole.  In a worst-case scenario, trade wars may affect Japanese markets more than China if they boost the safe-haven yen and depress the Nikkei.

January's current account deficit was $7.096 billion, worse than forecast, highlighting how dependent Turkey is on foreign capital. Higher interest rates could help fix that by luring overseas flows and reducing inflation, which is in the double digits. But there are fears President Tayyip Erdogan -- a self-declared \"enemy\" of interest rates -- is escalating his campaign for lower borrowing costs.  The lira has already fallen 6 percent to the dollar this year and a bigger current account gap than expected could tip it lower still. The central bank has little firepower to support it. Its next rate-setting meeting on April 25 could become even more crucial after next week.

But risks may be growing.

Sports bankers said the Denver Broncos, New Orleans Saints and Tennessee Titans could change hands in the next few years.  While bidders have emerged for the Panthers, several of them appear unwilling to pay far more than what they believe to be the fair price \u2014 around $2.3 billion, according to people with knowledge of the process.  So far, there are six bidders, according to a person with knowledge of the process, though only four are publicly known. David Tepper, the founder of the hedge fund Appaloosa Management and a minority owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers; Michael Rubin, the chairman of Fanatics, the sports merchandise company; and Ben Navarro, who owns Sherman Financial Group, an investment firm, have each made bids to buy the team. The three offers were between $2 billion and $2.2 billion, according to several people with knowledge of the bids who could not publicly discuss the auction.  Alan Kestenbaum, the chief executive of Bedrock Industries, which owns and operates metal and mining companies, has also bid, though it\u2019s unclear at what price.  The sale of the team has been a point of focus at the N.F.L. owners meeting here. Representatives from the 32 teams were briefed on the auction on Monday. They were told that a winning bid could be selected by the end of April. Assuming the prospective owner survives due diligence, the owners could vote on that bid at their next meeting in Atlanta in late May.

Soon after Sports Illustrated published a report detailing those allegations, Richardson, 82, said he would sell the team.  Certain N.F.L. owners have already started to make their preferences known. Many owners have said that, all bids being equal, they prefer Tepper because he already owns a stake in the Steelers, which he would have to sell if he bought the Panthers, and because he has the financial wherewithal, with a net worth of roughly $11 billion.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Rubin, who teamed up on his bid with Joe Tsai, the co-founder of the Alibaba Group, is also known to N.F.L. owners because Fanatics is the official retail partner of team merchandise.  While both Tepper and Rubin appear willing to continue bidding for the team, neither are prepared to pay $2.5 billion, according to several people with knowledge of the auction, though they could be posturing.  Representatives for Tepper, Rubin, Kestenbaum and Navarro all declined to comment.  At the meetings here, three owners who declined to be identified because they did not want to be seen injecting themselves into the process, said that Navarro\u2019s holdings in companies that lend to subprime borrowers might be a stumbling block for them.  Navarro\u2019s company, Sherman Financial Group, has stakes in financial services companies around the world, but 90 percent of the revenue and income comes from Credit One Bank, which issues credit cards to credit-challenged customers. Credit One has been sued for using aggressive collection techniques.  Among other things, Sherman Financial also buys and manages consumer debt. Sherman Financial also paid a $175,000 penalty to settle a case brought by New York attorney general Eric Scheiderman for unlawful debt collection.

Perhaps the greatest analytical error across the West has been the view that Xi Jinping would want to continue to sustain the liberal, international rules-based order once its economic power began to rival that of the United States. Again, this hope goes against the well-known facts: China has long said that it sees the existing order as one invented by the victors of the last world war, one in which China did not have a seat at the table.  China has never shared the West\u2019s view of human rights. It has long sought to weaken the powers of the United Nations Human Rights Commission. China has at best had an ambivalent attitude to free trade \u2014 just look at its qualified support for the World Trade Organization, its opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership and its own long history of mercantilism.  And as for the global security order, China has never changed its hostility to the global system of American military alliances, in particular those in the Asia Pacific, which it has long attacked as legacies of the Cold War. That\u2019s in addition to China\u2019s assertion of its territorial claims in the South China Sea.  For these reasons, Mr. Xi has explicitly called for \u201ca new type of great power relations,\u201d \u201ca new type of international system\u201d emerging out of the \u201ccurrent struggle for the international order\u201d and a new type of activist Chinese diplomacy that puts to bed Deng Xiaoping\u2019s dictum of \u201chide your strength, bide your time, and never take the lead.\u201d Hence its efforts to foster an alternative multilateral system with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Belt and Road Initiative.  Over time Mr. Xi would like to turn the page on the liberal Western order and write a new chapter in world history. If China in the next decade becomes the largest economy in the world with Mr. Xi still likely its leader, the country\u2019s economic success would be based on a form of state capitalism that rejects the notion that rising income parallels broader economic liberalization and political democracy.  None of us knows how much Mr. Xi will seek to apply the principles of this \u201cChina model\u201d to the wider international order. There will be tensions here.

The Ant equity purchase was announced as Alibaba reported robust third-quarter earnings of 24.1 billion yuan ($3.82 billion), up from 17.9 billion yuan in the like quarter the previous year. That topped a forecast of 21.6 billion yuan by analysts polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence.  Revenue for the quarter increased 56% from the year-earlier period, to 83.0 billion yuan.

The acquisition of the one-third stake in Ant would put Alibaba in a position to benefit if Ant were to go public, which has long been anticipated. Ant Financial was last valued at $60 billion in a 2016 financing round, and the company has grown significantly since then.  Scott Freeze, chief investment officer at Sabretooth Advisors in Pennsylvania, whose fund owns Alibaba stock, said the move suggests Alibaba is preparing its Ant affiliate for a public offering and wants to profit from the company\u2019s mobile payments business as it expands in India, Japan and Korea and other countries.  Alibaba shares were down about 3.8% in recent trade in New York. Mr. Freeze said the sell off was an overreaction to the news, as the stake would give Alibaba access to direct revenue from Ant and more authority over decision-making.  Alibaba\u2019s Chief Financial Officer Maggie Wu declined to comment on IPO speculation.  The companies said that following Alibaba\u2019s stake acquisition, they would terminate their current profit-sharing arrangement which entitles Alibaba to 37.5% of Ant\u2019s pre-tax profit, paid in the form of royalty and technology fees. There would be no cash impact to Alibaba.  Ant paid Alibaba $30 million in such fees in the three months to December, down sharply from amounts in recent quarters because Ant spent heavily to grow its Alipay user base.  Ant paid Alibaba a total of $735 million during the 2017 calendar year, implying that Ant\u2019s pre-tax profit last year was roughly $2 billion.  In a call with investors, Alibaba Vice Chairman Joe Tsai said the Ant stake would allow Alibaba to expand its role of providing value-added services such as mobile payments to upgrade traditional brick and mortar businesses.  The agreement would also give Alibaba more firepower to expand overseas, as payment methods are a key component of online retail, he said.  In its third-quarter report, Alibaba said revenue from its core ecommerce unit\u2014which runs China\u2019s two most popular online retail sites, Taobao and Tmall\u2014remained strong. Sales rose 57% to 73.2 billion yuan.  Alibaba is seeking to expand beyond online commerce into physical retail stores as well, expanding its chain of supermarkets and making a $2.9 billion investment in China\u2019s second-largest big-box retailer Sun Art Retail in the quarter.  Alibaba said its cloud-computing business revenue more than doubled to 3.6 billion yuan, as it attracted more paying customers and introduced more paying services.  Sales from Alibaba\u2019s digital-media and entertainment division, which includes mobile browser UCWeb, video-streaming site Youku Tudou and Alibaba Pictures Group , rose to 5.4 billion yuan. Analysts say intense competition in the digital-entertainment space will weigh on the company going forward, as Alibaba seeks to invest in more content to attract new viewers.  Alibaba\u2019s Youku video-streaming platform attracted about 374 million monthly active users as of Dec 2017, behind Baidu-backed iQiyi and Tencent Video, according to Quest Mobile figures.  \u2014Chuin-Wei Yap contributed to this story  Write to Liza Lin at Liza.Lin@wsj.com", "stock": "BABA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-01", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/alibaba-earnings-jump-35-1517488507"}, {"article": "Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, which with an affiliate currently owns 43% of food-delivery service Ele.me\u2014whose drivers here prepare for a morning shift in Beijing last September\u2014said Monday that it will buy the rest.

BABA -2.21% Executive Chairman Jack Ma is doubling down on Southeast Asia, investing another $2 billion in e-commerce subsidiary Lazada Group and naming trusted confidante Lucy Peng as its chief executive.  The investment announced Monday comes on top of the $2 billion the Chinese e-commerce giant has poured into Lazada since buying a majority stake in 2016.  Singapore-based Lazada operates online marketplaces in six Southeast Asian countries including Indonesia, selling everything from lipstick and car wax to instant coffee and smartphones.  Ms. Peng, a billionaire who helped found Alibaba in 1999, will replace Lazada founder Max Bittner as CEO. Ms. Peng is currently chairwoman of Lazada and will retain that role.  The 44-year-old Ms. Peng helped build Alibaba\u2019s mobile-payment affiliate Ant Financial Services Group\u2014previously known as Alipay\u2014serving as chief executive from 2010 to 2016, and still serves as its chairwoman.

The region is home to about 600 million people, and is increasingly attracting the interest of global e-commerce companies eager to get a foothold as more people get internet access and shop online, largely via smartphones.  U.S. e-commerce behemoth Amazon.com Inc. launched its Prime Now fast delivery option in Singapore last July. Chinese online retailer JD.com and Tencent Holdings Ltd -backed Sea Holdings Ltd. also operate e-commerce platforms or have joint ventures in the region.  Southeast Asia\u2019s e-commerce market has grown more than 40% annually since 2015 to reach $10.9 billion in revenue last year, according to a December report co-written by Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and Temasek Holdings. The market is expected to grow to $88.1 billion by 2025, the report forecast.  Alibaba owns about 83% of Lazada. The subsidiary helped Alibaba almost double its international commerce retail revenues to $727 million in the quarter ended Dec. 31, the company said in a statement in February, describing markets in the region as \u201cin the early innings of the game\u201d and pledging to continue investing there.

Wanda is now in business with China\u2019s two largest internet giants as it moves to shore up its balance sheet. The company struck an agreement in late January to sell a 34-billion-yuan stake in its property business, which mainly comprises shopping malls, to a group that included Chinese social-media titan Tencent Holdings Ltd.  Last year, Wanda came under fire from Beijing for its aggressive overseas deal-making, which curtailed the company\u2019s ability to pay for overseas acquisitions and repay debt. The company since has sold billions of dollars in assets both in China and abroad.  In a regulatory filing Monday, Mr. Wang\u2019s publicly listed cinema unit, Wanda Film Holding Co., said it would sell a stake of more than 12% to Alibaba and Cultural Investment Holdings Co. , a film company partly owned by the Beijing municipal government.  Alibaba will buy a 7.7% stake in Wanda Film for about 4.7 billion yuan, while Cultural Investment will take a stake of about 5% for 3.1 billion yuan, Wanda Film said.  Wanda Film said the deal with Alibaba was signed to strengthen their partnership in movie distribution, film investment, advertising and online ticket sales.

Alibaba founder Jack Ma, center, raises a ceremonial mallet before striking a bell during the company's IPO at the New York Stock Exchange. Photo: Mark Lennihan/Associated Press  Technology giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is working on a plan to list on a stock exchange in its home market, China, according to people familiar with the matter, more than three years after its blockbuster initial public offering in New York.  Alibaba is evaluating ways in which its shares could be traded by investors on the mainland, the people said. A secondary listing in China could happen as soon as this summer if the country\u2019s securities rules are changed to allow listings of foreign companies, one of the people added. While the bulk of Alibaba\u2019s business and operations are in China, the nearly 20-year-old company is incorporated in the Cayman Islands.  Chinese laws have long prohibited overseas companies from selling shares directly to local investors. China also currently forbids companies with shares that carry different voting rights to list on the mainland. Alibaba has a complex ownership structure that gives its founders and a small group of executives more control over the company than other shareholders.  The company in 2014 launched a $25 billion float on the New York Stock Exchange in what remains the world\u2019s largest IPO.  An Alibaba spokeswoman said the company has been considering a listing in China since 2014, if regulations would permit it.  Chinese authorities are trying to lure some of the country\u2019s technology stalwarts back to its capital markets. Alibaba\u2019s shares have climbed 86% over the past year and have more than doubled since their IPO, gains that investors in China have largely missed out on. The company now has a market capitalization of around $493 billion and is one of the world\u2019s most valuable technology firms.  In recent months, China\u2019s securities regulator has been in touch with several investment banks to discuss ways to allow companies listed abroad to issue securities on the mainland, the Journal previously reported.  Liu Shiyu, chairman of the Chinese securities regulator, recently confirmed the government has been working to win over overseas Chinese listings. \u201cYou will see results,\u201d he said on the sidelines of a legislative meeting in Beijing last week. \u201cA bit slower than the firms expect and a bit quicker than you expect,\u201d he added.  Noting that Chinese investors haven\u2019t been able to profit from the share gains of some foreign-listed companies that he didn\u2019t identify, Mr. Liu called it \u201ca pity, a real pity\u201d and said this \u201ccannot happen again.\u201d China\u2019s securities regulator didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment Thursday.  Some of the regulator\u2019s discussions with banks have revolved around the creation of financial instruments called depositary receipts, which represent interests in the shares of foreign-listed companies.  Enticing Chinese tech companies trading abroad, such as Alibaba, Baidu Inc. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. , to list at home has become a national priority in recent months.  Chinese regulators want large homegrown companies and promising startups to participate in its capital markets, giving retail investors an opportunity to tap into the wealth generated by successful companies, among other goals. Tencent, whose shares have also doubled over the past year, is listed in Hong Kong, while Baidu is listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market.  A dual listing on the mainland would give Chinese companies the option of raising money domestically in their local currency and help boost their profile at home, said Rocky Lee, managing partner of the Silicon Valley office of law firm King & Wood Mallesons. He added that well-known companies could potentially fetch higher valuations for their shares from local investors, because their brands and businesses are better known domestically.  However, China\u2019s stock market has historically had a reputation for being akin to a casino, and some analysts have said the listings of a few hot names could fuel speculation by Chinese individual investors, who dominate trading in the markets.  From the Archives Alibaba is China\u2019s largest e-commerce company but it does a lot more than just sell toys and clothes. The WSJ\u2019s Ken Brown explains how Alibaba\u2019s network of interconnected products and services have led them to become the biggest e-commerce company in China. (Originally Published May 4, 2014)  China\u2019s securities regulator is expected to announce plans for a depositary share regime in the coming months, said people familiar with discussions it has had recently.  Depositary receipts are a common feature of major stock markets in the U.S. and Europe. Dozens of Chinese companies that are listed on the NYSE or Nasdaq have American depositary receipt programs typically administered by large banks.  In the case of Baidu, every 10 American depositary shares represent an interest in one of the internet company\u2019s class A ordinary shares. Alibaba\u2019s New York-listed securities are also American depositary shares, with each representing one ordinary share.  Another tech company that is considering listing in China as well as overseas is smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp., people familiar with the matter previously told the Journal. The homegrown company is planning to raise at least $10 billion in an initial public offering later this year, and has picked Hong Kong as its main listing venue but is also considering a concurrent listing on the mainland at the behest of Chinese authorities, the people said. Xiaomi\u2019s parent company is also incorporated in the Cayman Islands, and to list in China it may also have to use a depositary receipt structure.  \u2014Chao Deng contributed to this article  Write to Julie Steinberg at julie.steinberg@wsj.com and Liza Lin at Liza.Lin@wsj.com", "stock": "BABA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-15", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-tech-titan-alibaba-plans-stock-market-homecoming-1521116131"}, {"article": "Lucy Peng will focus on running Lazada Group, an operator of online retail marketplaces in Southeast Asia that Alibaba invested $2 billion in.

Photo: Misha Friedman/Bloomberg News  Lucy Peng, one of China\u2019s richest businesswomen, is leaving the helm of one of the country\u2019s most valuable private companies.  Ms. Peng, 44 years old, stepped down as executive chairman of Ant Financial Services Group, the giant financial-technology affiliate of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA -2.21% that she led for eight years.  She is being replaced by Eric Jing, Ant\u2019s chief executive officer, who is taking on the additional chairman role with immediate effect, Ant said in a statement Monday. Mr. Jing, who is 45 years old, has been CEO since October 2016, when he took over the job from Ms. Peng.  Ant said Ms. Peng will focus on running Lazada Group, an operator of online retail marketplaces in Southeast Asia that Alibaba is using as a beachhead to expand in the region. Ant\u2019s statement said Lazada\u2019s growth is a key part of Alibaba\u2019s global strategy.  Ms. Peng, who is also one of Alibaba\u2019s co-founders, was named CEO of the Singapore-based company in March after Alibaba invested $2 billion in Lazada, adding to an earlier multibillion-dollar investment. She is also chairman of the company, in which Alibaba took a controlling stake in 2016.  Ant\u2019s management change comes as the company is raising as much as $5 billion from private investors, according to people familiar with the matter. The effort is widely seen as a prelude to an initial public offering of Ant, though there is no certainty the company will proceed with a listing in the near term. A spokesman for Ant declined to comment.  Hangzhou-based Ant\u2019s last announced fundraising round was in April 2016, when the company secured $4.5 billion from Chinese investors and earned a valuation of around $60 billion. Since then, the company has increased revenue, expanded its giant Alipay mobile-payments network, entered new markets and widened its scope of financial services for individuals and small businesses. It also has an asset-management business that oversees the world\u2019s largest money-market fund.  Ant\u2019s current fundraising effort includes local and foreign investors, who have subscribed to at least $3 billion of its shares, a person familiar with the matter said. Some market participants expect the latest share sale to give Ant a valuation of close to $100 billion.  Ms. Peng, who is famously media shy, has been a confidante of billionaire founder Jack Ma. She ran Alipay from 2010 to 2014, a period that spanned the business getting carved out from Alibaba and its rebranding as Ant. She went on to lead Ant as its CEO until 2016. Ms. Peng also became a billionaire after Alibaba\u2019s 2014 initial public offering.  \u201cShe definitely doesn\u2019t seek the limelight, but she gets on with it,\u201d said Duncan Clark, a former investment banker and chairman of tech consultancy BDA China, who wrote a book on Alibaba. Mr. Clark recalled that when some Ant staff pushed for transport and other perks similar to those provided by Western tech giants such as Apple or Google, Ms. Peng rebuffed them, telling her staff to focus on working hard. \u201cShe was very matter of fact,\u201d he added.  Before working at Ant, Ms. Peng held a longtime role as Alibaba\u2019s chief human-resources executive. She played an integral role in establishing Ant\u2019s corporate culture and overseeing the expansion of Alipay, which is used by more than 520 million people to pay for everything including groceries, movie tickets and utility bills.  Mr. Ma, in an internal email Monday, said that when Ms. Peng took the post of executive chairman of Lazada, \u201cLucy told me the time had come for Eric to take on even more responsibility and for her to step away and give Ant\u2019s leadership team the space to grow even faster.\u201d  Mr. Jing previously held other positions within Ant and Alipay, including chief operating officer, president and chief financial officer. He joined Alibaba in 2007 as a finance executive and started working at Alipay two years later.  Mr. Jing on Monday called Ms. Peng a mentor and said she was \u201cinstrumental in cultivating a world-class Ant Financial team\u201d that will stay true to its mission, according to Ant\u2019s statement.  Alibaba said in February that it would acquire about a one-third stake in Ant and end a profit-sharing agreement with the affiliate.

Founded in 2014, SenseTime is among a handful of Chinese AI startups that got their start selling facial-recognition systems to local police agencies. With a vast network of surveillance cameras, China is using facial recognition to identify criminal suspects as well as to influence behavior, such as discouraging jaywalking.  The technology also has commercial applications, with some companies now using it instead of badges to grant employees access to their workplaces. Mr. Xu said SenseTime would use the new funding to focus on expanding the technology\u2019s commercial applications and AI capabilities.

The $522-billion Chinese firm said Thursday that its revenue last quarter grew 56% from a year ago to $12.8 billion\u2014the highest ever. The December quarter always has been big for Alibaba because of Singles\u2019 Day, an annual shopping bonanza in China on Nov. 11.  But part of the increase came from acquisitions as well as its big push into physical retail. This is the first quarter that Alibaba included revenue from Cainiao, its logistics subsidiary, after it increased its stake to 51% in October. It took private department store operator Intime last May. Alibaba also has opened 26 supermarkets, named Hema, in seven cities.  Stripping all those out, revenue would have grown only 41%\u2014still impressive but slower than usual over the past two years. Taking its toll last quarter: China\u2019s crackdown on internet finance and the expulsion of migrant workers in Beijing. Alibaba\u2019s aggressive expansion in physical retail also weighed on margins. Operating profit margin for its e-commerce segment shrank to 48% from 59% from a year earlier.  Alibaba also said it would acquire a 33% stake in Ant Financial, its affiliate that operates China\u2019s largest mobile payment system Alipay. This was expected, according to a 2014 agreement. It will, however, hurt Alibaba as it is receiving 37.5% of Ant\u2019s pretax profits as royalty and technology services fees. But such profit share fell last quarter because of Ant\u2019s aggressive spending to acquire new users. Faced with strong competition from Tencent, profit at Ant may continue to be under pressure.  While Alibaba is still growing fast, much of that has been priced in\u2014the stock trades at 42 times this year\u2019s expected GAAP earnings, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence, after doubling in the past year.

Other big IPOs have seen narrower day-one ranges. The trading range of Snap on its first day was 10.85%, while for Chinese technology giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. it was 10.84%. Snap\u2019s IPO took place last year, while Alibaba\u2019s was in 2014.  Spotify had \u201cfairly low volatility for the first day of trading for a technology IPO,\u201d said Cameron Stanfill, an analyst at PitchBook.  Spotify used an unusual maneuver called a direct listing to go public. The company warned investors that the process could result in greater volatility than a traditional IPO.  In a direct listing, a company simply floats its shares on the stock market. Unlike in a typical IPO, there is no underwriting bank to act as a \u201cstabilizing agent\u201d and prop up the company\u2019s share price if it tumbles out of the gate. There are also no underwriters to market the company\u2019s shares to big investors ahead of the listing, a process called \u201cbook-building\u201d that helps gauge demand in a standard IPO.  \u201cWith a direct listing, you\u2019re coming into the process with less certain supply and demand,\u201d said Joe Mecane, head of execution services at Citadel Securities.  As Spotify\u2019s designated market maker at the New York Stock Exchange, Citadel Securities oversaw the opening of trading in Spotify\u2019s shares, in consultation with one of the company\u2019s financial advisers, Morgan Stanley.  Still, it remains to be seen how Spotify performs over the next few days. One of the other quirks of the direct-listing process is that \u201clock-up\u201d restrictions\u2013which restrict sales of shares by insiders in a normal IPO\u2013are much looser in the case of Spotify. That means shares in the music-streaming company could tumble if many of its existing shareholders decide to sell.", "stock": "BABA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-04-03", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2018/04/03/spotify-shakes-off-doubters-with-smooth-debut/"}, {"article": "Ant Financial\u2019s mascot on display in an office in Hangzhou, China.

BIDU -1.37% has filed for an initial public offering in the U.S., promoting its ability to use artificial intelligence and user data to deliver videos that generate billions of views.  In a U.S. regulatory filing, Baidu said it would list iQiyi on the Nasdaq exchange and is seeking to raise around $1.5 billion. Analysts at Jefferies have valued iQiyi at $17 billion.  The move comes as Baidu looks to raise money for the loss-making unit to stay ahead in the fiercely competitive video-streaming sector where tech titans Tencent Holdings Ltd. TCEHY -3.15% and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA -2.21% also have strong plays. Baidu told investors in its most recent earnings call that it would remain iQiyi\u2019s controlling shareholder.  IQiyi, which was founded in 2010 and will list under the ticker IQ, said it is China\u2019s largest video-streaming service by amount of time spent watching, with more than 50 million paid subscribers.  Two of its original series, \u201cThe Mystic Nine\u201d and \u201cBurning Ice,\u201d have together garnered more than 13 billion views, the company said in its filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  \u201cWe distinguish ourselves in the online entertainment industry by our leading technology platform powered by advanced AI, big data analytics and other core proprietary technologies,\u201d the company said in its filing. \u201cOur core proprietary technologies are critical to producing content that caters to user tastes, delivering superior entertainment experience to our users.\u201d  In China, people spend the majority of their online-entertainment time on video, and the market overall is expected to grow to 688 billion yuan ($109 billion) by 2022, up from about 51 billion yuan in 2012, iQiyi said, citing a report by iResearch Consulting Group.  But a tough competitive environment and the costs of providing content have made streaming a money-losing proposition for Baidu, as well as for its internet rivals Tencent and Alibaba.  \u201cWe incurred net losses since our inception,\u201d iQiyi said in its filing, including losses of 3.7 billion yuan in 2017.  Junwen Woo, a senior analyst at IHS Markit who tracks online video in Asia, said iQiyi has potential because of its use of AI, which helps the company differentiate from competing Chinese video platforms operated by much bigger rivals Alibaba and Tencent.  \u201cThey can know what is the most popular content and what are the most favorite things viewers like\u2014and what is coming up next,\u201d she said.  In fundraising last year, iQiyi raised $1.53 billion, an investment that came months after investors balked at a $2.3 billion buyout bid from a group led by Baidu Chief Executive Robin Li, saying the proposal undervalued the unit.

The Tongzhou Wanda Plaza shopping mall in Beijing is operated by Dalian Wanda Group Co., which is controlled by Chinese billionaire Wang Jianlin. Photo: Tomohiro Ohsumi/Bloomberg News  An investor group that includes China\u2019s Tencent Holdings Ltd. and online retailer JD.com Inc. JD -1.97% is spending 34 billion yuan ($5.37 billion) for a 14% stake in Chinese billionaire Wang Jianlin\u2019s commercial-property company as he faces a deadline to relist the business in China.  Wanda, China\u2019s largest mall developer, is benefiting from an escalating war for consumers and data between Tencent and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA -2.21% , the country\u2019s two largest internet companies.  Alibaba has already established several partnerships with department-store and supermarket chains in China, and is seeking to integrate online retail with physical stores.  Tencent has invested in Alibaba\u2019s online shopping rival JD.com, and the deal announced Monday gives both a partner in China\u2019s shopping-mall business as they seek to blunt Alibaba\u2019s move into physical stores. The traditional stores are seen as a way to attract new customers and, for Tencent and Alibaba, as a means to expand their mobile payment platforms.  \u201cThe deal represents one of the world\u2019s largest single strategic investments between internet companies and brick-and-mortar commercial giants,\u201d parent company Dalian Wanda Group and the others said in a joint release. Other investors include electronics retailer Suning Commerce Group and fellow property developer Sunac Holdings Ltd.  This month, Tencent signed a partnership agreement with French retailer Carrefour S.A. and a local supermarket chain, agreeing to take a stake in Carrefour\u2019s Chinese entity. In Shanghai, it also is testing an unmanned pop-up store with consumers using mobile payments to complete the sale.  JD will invest 5 billion yuan into Wanda Commercial Properties Co., the company said in a regulatory filing. JD took part in the deal to create multichannel approaches to shopping, a JD spokesman said.  In announcing the investment, Wanda said the aim was to speed up the adoption of its \u201casset-light\u201d model that would allow it to earn income from managing properties instead of owning them.  Wanda Commercial raised 34.5 billion Hong Kong dollars ($4.34 billion) from private investors to delist the company\u2019s Hong Kong shares in 2016, in the biggest take-private deal on the city\u2019s exchange. Wanda\u2019s aim was to relist the company in China, where big appetite from retail investors helps companies fetch higher valuations.  Last year, Wanda came under fire from Beijing for its aggressive overseas deal-making, which curtailed the company\u2019s ability to pay for overseas acquisitions and repay debt. To shore up its balance sheet, the company since has sold billions of dollars in assets both in China and abroad. Wanda\u2019s Hong Kong-listed unit said Monday in a regulatory filing that it was selling two Australian real-estate projects as part of those efforts.  Wanda faced a September deadline to relist Wanda Commercial or repay investors in full plus interest of up to 10%, a person familiar with the transaction said.  The investors\u2019 stake, which collectively equals 14%, will be transferred to the new group and could clear a path for regulators to approve Wanda Commercial\u2019s relisting in Shanghai. The sale also represents a 22% premium over what investors originally paid to delist the stake.

The country\u2019s securities regulator has reached out to a number of state-owned investment banks to explore ways to let already-listed companies and private businesses issue shares on the mainland, according to investment bankers briefed on the discussions.  \u2018The government has a long-term plan to wean these companies off the U.S.\u2019 \u2014Paul Gillis, Peking University\u2019s Guanghua School of Management  One option being considered is to allow such companies to issue depositary receipts, so they can bypass Chinese law prohibiting firms incorporated overseas from going public on the mainland. The likes of Tencent and Alibaba are incorporated abroad in a special corporate structure so they can get around Chinese restrictions on foreigners investing in sectors like technology.  It is part of China\u2019s longer-term goal to turn the tide on years of the country\u2019s businesses going public overseas. Beijing would like to see more Chinese companies choose the mainland capital market as their primary listing destination eventually, the investment bankers said.  \u201cAt some point, it makes sense for Alibaba and Tencent to have their primary listings in China,\u201d said Paul Gillis, an accounting professor at Peking University\u2019s Guanghua School of Management. \u201cThe government has a long-term plan to wean these companies off the U.S.\u201d  \u201cThis would be a step in that direction,\u201d he said.  Tencent and Alibaba are already among the world\u2019s most valuable companies, and China has earmarked frontier technologies such as artificial intelligence as important growth drivers for the country\u2019s economy.  Shares in Hong Kong-listed Tencent\u2014the owner of China\u2019s most popular messaging app, WeChat\u2014more than doubled last year. In the process Tencent became the first Chinese technology company to crack the $500 billion valuation club, joining industry titans such as Facebook Inc. and Apple Inc.  NYSE-listed shares of Alibaba, China\u2019s largest e-commerce company, almost doubled last year. Alibaba now has a market capitalization of more than $460 billion.  In recent days, a number of tech companies said they are open to a China listing, though executives haven\u2019t gone into details. Tencent Chief Executive Pony Ma said the company would \u201cactively consider\u201d listing inside China. Baidu Inc. Chairman Robin Li said recently that the search-engine company has \u201calways wanted to come home to China.\u201d Richard Liu, chairman of Nasdaq-listed e-commerce company JD.com Inc., said \u201cif the authorities allow it, we are willing.\u201d The executives were speaking on the sidelines of China\u2019s annual legislative meetings, currently taking place in Beijing.  Chinese technology firms have in the past often opted for overseas listings, many in the U.S., for the prestige and to benefit from rules allowing dual-class share structures that give company owners more control over the business. The Chinese regulator\u2019s tough listing rules, such as the requirement for companies to be profitable for three years before listing, have also deterred high-growth technology firms from seeking direct share sales at home.  The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month that Chinese regulators have already approached smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp., which has plans to go public in Hong Kong. Investors say it would be sensible for China\u2019s technology companies to list at home, given the brand awareness they command there and the likelihood their shares would trade at high valuations.  Still, analysts have some concerns. Depending on how contracts are drawn up, Chinese individual investors buying depository receipts could lack full shareholder rights, they say. The listings of a few hot names could also fuel speculation by Chinese individual investors, who dominate trading on the mainland.  \u201cWhen the government is supporting something, everyone rushes in,\u201d said T.J. Wong, a professor of business administration and accounting at the University of Southern California\u2019s Marshall School of Business. \u201cWhat you don\u2019t want is a huge bubble, then a burst.\u201d  Chinese companies often have to wait years before getting approval from the market regulator to list their shares. The authorities would likely expedite this process for some tech firms, the investment bankers said.  Letting a number of top-quality companies issue shares on the mainland could help the Chinese market mature, analysts said. Beijing\u2019s goal, said one foreign banker, is to \u201ctake the winners.\u201d  It isn\u2019t clear when the regulator would formally invite specific companies into its market, given that changes to Chinese securities law would need high-level leadership approval.  \u2014Yoko Kubota contributed to this article.

TCEHY -3.15% \u2014dominant forces in e-commerce, mobile payments and social media\u2014now are elbowing their way into autos, threatening established car makers.  These three companies\u2014the so-called BATs\u2014are plowing millions of dollars into electric-vehicle startups, car-sharing services and online retailers, as well as software platforms for autonomous driving and online car selling.  U.S. tech companies, notably Alphabet Inc. and its self-driving car unit Waymo, also are pushing into the auto sector. But the BAT companies have a big advantage in China, where tight government internet controls make it difficult for foreign enterprises to compete. For example, non-Chinese companies aren\u2019t allowed to operate digital mapping systems needed for autonomous driving.  BAT-Mobiles Chinese tech giants Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent have become major players in the auto business. Their interests span from electric-vehicle startups to smartcar software and online retail channels. Major BAT activities since 2013 Baidu Baidu Alibaba Alibaba Tencent Tencent Filter by Type All Partnership Software EV Ride-hailing Car-retail \u2014 TAP HOVER FOR DETAIL\u2014 Sources: Dealogic, staff reports  That has prompted both foreign and domestic auto companies like Ford Motor Co. , BMW AG , SAIC Motor Corp. and Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co. to seal tech partnerships with the BAT firms. This month, Renault SA said it is aiming for a fivefold increase in Chinese sales by 2023 as the result of a deal to sell cars on Alibaba\u2019s online retail platforms. Renault also said it would start using Alibaba\u2019s connectivity software in its cars in China.  The threat posed by China\u2019s internet giants was underscored when Li Shufu, the founder of Zhejiang Geely, announced last month that the company would invest $9 billion in a 9.7% stake in Mercedes-Benz parent Daimler AG .  \u201cThe competitors that challenge the global car industry in the 21st century technologically are not part of the automotive industry today,\u201d Mr. Li said in a statement. \u201cNo current car industry player will be able to win this battle against the invaders from outside independently.\u201d  Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent are betting that the auto industry is going to shift from selling hardware to selling services, with revenues derived mainly from selling subscriptions to features like shared autonomous vehicles and high-speed mobile internet.  \u201cThe BATs want people in cars using their online services. They see mobility as an on-ramp into their ecosystems,\u201d said Bill Russo, an ex-Chrysler executive who now runs Shanghai consultancy Automobility. \u201cSo they\u2019re all actively investing in mobility... This is a game that\u2019s not happening anywhere else. It\u2019s what makes China so unique.\u201d  Baidu Chief Executive Robin Li has made developing self-driving cars a priority for the search and mapping company. \u201cIn future commutes, you won\u2019t have to focus much on driving anymore,\u201d he said, on the sidelines of China\u2019s annual legislative session in Beijing this week. \u201cYou\u2019ll be able to have hot pot and sing karaoke on the ride.\u201d  Chen Hong, chairman of SAIC Motor, China\u2019s biggest car maker, speaking separately at the legislative session, acknowledged the tech giants\u2019 threat but said traditional auto makers have an edge in understanding drivers and their needs.  Still, these auto makers need partners. SAIC has launched an internet-connected car powered by AliOS, Alibaba\u2019s in-car operating system. Two big state-run car makers, Beijing Auto and Guangzhou Auto, are developing similar so-called smartcars with Baidu and Tencent respectively. Last year, Ford and BMW both said they, too, would launch smartcars using Alibaba\u2019s software.  The BATs are also generously bankrolling startups that are making smartcars slated to hit the China market later this year.  Alibaba-backed startup Xpeng Motor\u2019s new G3 SUV comes loaded with maps, music apps, Mandarin voice recognition and even a camera mounted on the roof, for buyers looking to post their travels on social media. Alibaba\u2019s technology and its knowledge of the consumer, accrued over nearly two decades as China\u2019s biggest e-commerce player, is helping Xpeng develop and grow quickly, said founder Xiaopeng He.  Traditional car makers need the BATs\u2019 strategic insights in a fast-changing marketplace, said Freeman Shen, whose electric-vehicle startup WM Motor is backed by Baidu and Tencent. Unless auto makers work with the BATs, said Mr. Shen, a former Geely executive, \u201cI don\u2019t think they can survive.\u201d  Baidu and Tencent are also investors in Shanghai-based NIO, whose debut electric vehicle has a voice-operated personal assistant, is able to park itself and comes loaded with apps provided by its two big tech backers.  The automobile is turning into a \u201cmobile living space,\u201d said NIO founder William Li. The passenger is a captive audience for internet services\u2014hence the BATs\u2019 interest in autos as potential channels for everything from online shopping to videogames to mobile TV.  All three companies have also invested in Didi Chuxing, China\u2019s answer to Uber. And Tencent, hedging its bets beyond China, last year bought 5% of Tesla Inc . for $1.78 billion.  For now, auto makers and tech companies can coexist by marrying car-making expertise with software innovation. \u201cWhen you put these two together you get a fantastic chemical reaction,\u201d said Simon Hu, who runs Alibaba\u2019s AliOS car operating-system division.  But as China\u2019s tech giants permeate the auto industry from all angles, the big question is: How much of the sector\u2019s revenues will they manage to commandeer? \u201cThe BATs have the bucks required to get into this game and stay in the game for however long it takes to win,\u201d said Michael Dunne, a Hong Kong-based auto consultant.  \u2014Yoko Kubota in Beijing contributed to this article.

So last week, he picked up the car for a three-day test drive from a vending machine.  Mr. Zhou never visited a dealership or spoke to a salesperson. He booked the test drive online, then showed up at a service center where employees can identify would-be buyers using facial-recognition technology. His SUV was then delivered from the eight-story \u201cvending machine\u201d\u2014essentially an automated parking garage.  \u201cThis is so much more efficient and convenient than traditional dealerships,\u201d said Mr. Zhou, 38 years old.  It\u2019s the first of several such car-vending centers that Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. plans to open across China this year\u2014part of the company\u2019s latest effort to translate its success in online retailing to the physical shopping world.  Alibaba is betting on the experiment to succeed in China, where consumers have enthusiastically embraced the e-commerce economy. Mr. Zhou buys clothes, home appliances and even the construction materials needed for his recent home renovation without going into a traditional store.  At Alibaba\u2019s auto vending center, a man requests delivery of a car. The center stands some 5 stories tall and contains more than 40 Ford vehicles. Photo: aleksandar plavecski/epa-efe/rex/EPA/Shutterstock  The car-vending concept has been tried in the U.S.\u2014with limited success. Carvana, a used-car dealer in Phoenix, has been operating such structures since 2013. Customers can search for, purchase, finance and trade-in vehicles online, then have the option of picking it up from a giant vending machine filled with cars.  But the model hasn\u2019t taken off more broadly in the U.S., where many consumers prefer to negotiate a deal in person, and have the salesperson help them with tasks such as pairing their smartphone with a car\u2019s Bluetooth, said David Sullivan, a Michigan-based analyst with AutoPacific Inc.  China\u2019s automotive retail climate is different\u2014and ripe for disruption, analysts say.  China\u2019s consumers, often first-time car buyers, are more open to trying out new concepts, said Dean Stoneley, Ford\u2019s Asia Pacific vice president for marketing. Ford has seen sales in China decline sharply in recent months as domestic competitors become more popular. Ford is now searching for new ways to engage customers, as more and more go online to do their car-buying research, Mr. Stoneley said.  \u201cA car vending machine is the ultimate word in frictionless commerce\u2014you don\u2019t have to deal with salespeople trying to talk you into things you don\u2019t want, and you don\u2019t have to haggle over price,\u201d said Jessica Wolfe, a principal in the Consumer and Retail practice of A.T. Kearney, a consulting firm. \u201cYou can think for yourself, do the research, and make the purchase when you\u2019re ready on your phone. That\u2019s exactly how millennials like to transact.\u201d  At the vending center, attendants are available to explain a car\u2019s basic features and to answer questions. Ford said each car has contact details of local dealerships where customers can go with questions or problems.  China\u2019s internet giants are experimenting with bringing the principles of e-commerce into other corners of the physical retail world as well. Just as Amazon.com Inc. is experimenting with unmanned supermarkets, Chinese e-commerce companies are taking stakes in malls and supermarkets, digitizing such operations as they seek growth beyond their core online retail business. In some cases, they\u2019re aiming to use the vast troves of data they have gleaned from e-commerce to change the way consumers shop in the real world.  Alibaba is experimenting with using augmented reality mirrors and vending machines in malls to allow consumers to \u201cvirtually\u201d try on various lipstick colors and buy them on the spot through Alibaba\u2019s online platforms.  JD.com Inc., which made its name in online ordering and delivery, is also getting into brick and mortar with a chain of clerkless convenience stores where shoppers can pay using facial-recognition technology.  Under the auto vending-machine program rolled out by Alibaba last week, customers go to Alibaba\u2019s Tmall website to book the test drive, which is free for those with high scores on the Sesame Credit rating system by Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial Services Group. Without a high credit score, consumers have to fork out 99 yuan ($16) to test-drive selected Ford sedans and 198 yuan for other models including a Ford Mustang sports car.  Alibaba is currently offering only Ford models, but it is in talks with other foreign and domestic brands to expand the inventory, said Lu Huan, the marketing director for Tmall\u2019s automotive division.  China is the world's largest market for electric vehicles, thanks largely to subsidies that drive costs down. Those incentives will end by 2020, but the government is betting that won't be the end of the road for its electric dream. Photo/Video: Eva Tam/The Wall Street \u200bJournal\u200b  The vending machine in Guangzhou saw brisk business on its first day of operation. In the first two days, Ford received 450 orders to test-drive the vehicle, Mr. Stoneley said. Ford declined to say if the new approach has resulted in any sales yet.  The vending machine helps to ease anxiety for potential car buyers, who are often tense when they enter a dealership expecting a hard sell, said James Chao, a Shanghai-based automotive consultant at IHS Markit.
