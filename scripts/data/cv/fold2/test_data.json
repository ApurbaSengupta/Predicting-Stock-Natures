[{"article": "(Reuters) - The chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board and Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk had a \u201cconstructive conversation\u201d on the agency\u2019s probe into a fatal crash involving a Tesla vehicle that was operating in semi-autonomous Autopilot mode, the agency said on Monday.

KTVU FOX 2/via REUTERS  The NTSB on April 1 had said it was \u201cunhappy\u201d that luxury electric car maker Tesla (TSLA.O) had made public information about the crash of a Model X vehicle that killed the car\u2019s driver.  NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt \u201chad what he described as a very constructive conversation with Mr. Musk over the weekend,\u201d agency spokesman Peter Knudson said. \u201cThey discussed the investigation of the March 23 Tesla crash, NTSB investigative processes, and Tesla\u2019s work to address the safety recommendations that were issued last year.\u201d  A Tesla spokeswoman declined to comment.  Slideshow (2 Images)  The crash has put a sharp focus on Tesla\u2019s Autopilot technology, which allows drivers to take their hands off the wheel for extended periods under certain conditions. Tesla requires users to agree to keep their hands on the wheel at all times before they can use Autopilot. Users, however, routinely brag they can use the system to drive hands-free.  Tesla said a week after the accident that vehicle logs showed no action had been taken by the driver right before the crash and that he had received earlier warnings to put his hands on the wheel.  The driver, who was 38, died at a nearby hospital shortly after the vehicle hit a concrete highway divider near Mountain View, in the San Francisco Bay Area. The mishap involved two other vehicles.  \u201cThe NTSB is looking into all aspects of this crash including the driver\u2019s previous concerns about the Autopilot,\u201d Christopher O\u2019Neil, another NTSB spokesman, said on April 1.  Last month, the company said that a search of its service records did not \u201cfind anything suggesting that the customer ever complained to Tesla about the performance of Autopilot. There was a concern raised once about navigation not working correctly, but Autopilot\u2019s performance is unrelated to navigation.\u201d  On March 30, Tesla disclosed that shortly before the crash, the vehicle\u2019s \u201cAutopilot was engaged with the adaptive cruise control follow-distance set to minimum.\u201d  Sumwalt last year said that \u201coperational limitations\u201d in the Tesla Model S played a \u201cmajor role\u201d in a May 2016 crash that killed a driver using Autopilot.  \u201cSystem safeguards were lacking,\u201d Sumwalt said in September. \u201cTesla allowed the driver to use the system outside of the environment for which it was designed and the system gave far too much leeway to the driver to divert his attention.\u201d  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is also investigating last month\u2019s crash. The two agencies are also probing a January crash of a Tesla that may have been in Autopilot mode and a fire truck.", "stock": "TSLA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-04-10", "source": "reuters", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-crash/ntsb-chairman-tesla-ceo-talk-after-fatal-autopilot-crash-idUSKBN1HH05V"}, {"article": "LOS ANGELES, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Electric vehicle maker and solar installer Tesla Inc. said on Tuesday that it does not expect President Donald Trump\u2019s solar tariff to have much impact on its high-tech solar manufacturing ambitions, thanks to a clause exempting a vast amount of solar panel components from the levies.  Trump\u2019s order, signed into law on Tuesday, imposes a 30 percent tariff on fully assembled imported solar panels as well as the cells of which the panels are made - a move intended to protect American jobs but which the solar industry worries will raise costs and trigger thousands of layoffs.  But in a twist destined to help the California company, the solar cell tariff only kicks in after 2.5 gigawatts worth hit U.S. shores each year.  Tesla uses solar cells in its nascent solar roof tile business. The tiles generate electricity without the need for a traditional panel. Tesla also has plans to build conventional panels using imported cells for its U.S.-based residential installation business, which it also hopes to grow over the coming years.  Tesla said on Tuesday it expects to be able to import \u201csome or all of our non-U.S. cells for Solar Roof and solar panel modules free of tariffs.\u201d  Only 500 MW worth of solar cells were imported into the United States in total last year, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, a fifth of what is being exempted from Trump\u2019s tariff.  Baird analyst Ben Kallo agreed the tariff was generally positive for Tesla as it will make its domestic products more competitive with imports - though he noted its installation business will pay higher prices for imported panels in the short term. Tesla shares rose $1.23, or 0.3 percent, to close at $352.79 on Tuesday.  Tesla had been part of a group of domestic manufacturers that lobbied against tariffs on solar products.

Nissan Motor Co Ltd\u2019s (7201.T) Infiniti pushed up sales by 11.3 percent, mainly by selling almost twice as many sport utility vehicles as cars. However, Infiniti\u2019s total 2017 sales of 153,415 vehicles put it behind the leading Germany luxury car brands, as well as Acura, Lexus and General Motors Co\u2019s (GM.N) Cadillac brand.  Lexus, Infiniti and Acura launched in the U.S. market in the late 1980s and took advantage of quality problems at Audi and a lack of innovation at the then-leading luxury brands in the market, General Motors Co\u2019s (GM.N) Cadillac and Ford Motor Co\u2019s (F.N) Lincoln brand.

Tesla.  Does Elon Musk control Tesla Inc.? Colloquially speaking, sure he does: He is Tesla's chief executive officer, the chairman of its board and its largest shareholder. He is also its co-founder, even though he didn't found it, which is a hard trick to pull off at a company that you don't control.  But there is also a narrower question, which is: Is Elon Musk the controlling shareholder of Tesla? That is less obvious. He owns about 22 percent of the stock, which is rather less than a majority, and it's all just normal stock, with no super-voting rights or anything. This narrower question matters because, under Delaware law (Tesla is a Delaware company), there are limits on what a controlling shareholder can do to enrich himself at the expense of a company that he controls. For instance, when Tesla acquired SolarCity Corp. in 2016, when Musk was SolarCity's chairman and largest shareholder (and his cousin was its CEO), and when SolarCity was financially troubled and needed to be bailed out by someone, that looked, to a lot of people, like kind of an awkward transaction.  But Delaware law does not have a category for \"kind of an awkward transaction.\" It has basically two relevant categories: If Musk was the controlling shareholder of Tesla, and caused Tesla to buy SolarCity, then a judge will review the transaction for \"entire fairness\" and, if he finds that the process or price was unfair, he can award damages for shareholders against Musk and the directors. But if Musk was not the controlling shareholder -- if he was just a CEO who happened to own some shares, and who was answerable to the board of directors and shareholders -- then the board's decision to buy SolarCity is subject to \"business judgment\" review, which basically means that the board can do whatever it wants. (Also even if he was the controlling shareholder, he could have avoided entire fairness review \"if at the outset of a self-dealing transaction the controlling stockholder effectively relinquished control over the outcome to an independent committee of disinterested directors and a nonwaivable, fully informed vote of a majority of the minority stockholders.\")  So is he the controlling shareholder? Yesterday a Delaware judge ruled on a motion to dismiss a shareholder lawsuit over the SolarCity deal and decided that it's a \"close call\" but that Musk might have controlled Tesla, so the lawsuit can go forward. The reasons for Musk's control are all the sort of obvious things: He owns a lot of shares, not a majority but enough to sway the vote; he dominates the board of directors and, in particular, dominated the board's discussion of the proposed SolarCity deal (bringing it to the board three times, and curiously never discussing the possibility of buying another solar company instead of SolarCity); he \"has demonstrated a willingness to facilitate the ouster of senior management when displeased\"; and he is central to the company's business, raising money for it and acting as its public face and authoring its \"Master Plan.\" (And while Tesla did require a majority of the non-Musk shareholders to approve the deal, and allowed independent directors to negotiate the price -- which I thought was rather good governance, considering -- Musk was fully involved in the board decisions about whether to do the deal.) You can't really object too much to that conclusion. Intuitively, Tesla is Musk's company, while also being a public company, and using a public company you control to bail out another public company that you also control seems like the sort of thing that controlling-shareholder rules are supposed to be suspicious of.  Still it's a little weird. Musk is the charismatic founder-CEO-visionary of Tesla, sure. But he owns 22 percent of the shares, with 22 percent of the vote. Plenty of other tech-company founder-CEO-visionaries have found much stronger ways to formalize their perpetual control. Mark Zuckerberg owns about 16 percent of the shares of Facebook Inc., but he controls almost 60 percent of the vote, and almost got the company to give him voting control forever even if he sells more of his stock. Evan Spiegel and Robert Murphy are the charismatic founder-visionaries of Snap Inc.; they own less than 40 percent of the stock between them, but control more than 88 percent of the vote. Meanwhile, just being a founder-CEO-visionary who dominates the board, has the ideas, and is the public face of the company is not necessarily enough to keep control, as Travis Kalanick can tell you. The voting power usually doesn't matter, when things are good for the founder-CEO-visionary, but when it matters it matters.  There seem to be two models of governance in large technology companies run by founder-visionaries: There is the founder-visionary-CEO as perpetual owner and controlling shareholder, who jealously guards his rights so that he can't be unseated by insurgent shareholders or directors, and there is the founder-visionary-CEO who actually does give shareholders a vote, and who relies on his charisma and vision to keep the shareholders and directors in line. Those models often come to more or less the same place, but they don't always; Musk has to wake up every day and persuade his shareholders and directors that his charismatic vision is the right one, in a way that Zuckerberg just doesn't. It's a little rough on Musk that he's not actually the controlling shareholder and the law treats him like he is anyway.  In other Tesla news, its bonds are cratering. \"You can see quickly that Tesla is singularly unsuited to using debt,\" wrote Aswath Damodaran back in August, when it was issuing debt. But \"bond investors pretty much ignored the carmaker\u2019s prolific cash burn and repeated failures to meet production targets and lent it $1.8 billion at record-low interest rates.\" I guess investors saw the unsuitability slowly: The bonds \"plunged to a low of 86 cents on the dollar\" yesterday, and Moody's Investors Service downgraded them to a Caa1 rating this week. I have to say that as I spend time this month reading financial-crisis anniversary pieces, I cannot get that worked up about a low-junk-rated money-losing company's bonds trading down to a 7.8 percent yield. As these things go, that's still pretty good.  A warning shot.  How are things at Deutsche Bank AG? Oh great, great, except that it has been widely reported that Chairman Paul Achleitner has grown tired of Chief Executive Officer John Cryan and is openly searching for his replacement. Yesterday Cryan sent out a staff memo saying that he is \"absolutely committed\" to staying, which is not quite the question that was being asked:  \u201cThe fact that Cryan must write his own defense and doesn\u2019t get any backing from Achleitner is a sign of weakness for the CEO,\u201d said Florian Sauerburger, a portfolio manager at Aramea Asset Management, which owns Deutsche Bank stock.  It's true. It rather seems like the intended audience for the memo was Achleitner and the board, and that its message was \"back off.\" \"We need to focus on executing on the strategy that was agreed and signed off by both the management and supervisory boards,\" wrote Cryan, who mentioned the \"destabilizing effect\" of \"widespread rumors\" and urged, \"Let\u2019s not allow ourselves to be thrown off course.\" They're all employee-appropriate sentiments, I guess, but also interpretable as an argument that the noisy search for his replacement should quiet down. Meanwhile there is this:  The person close to Mr Achleitner stressed that replacing Mr Cryan \u201cis not a foregone conclusion at this point\u201d, adding that the chief executive should take the debate as \u201ca warning shot\u201d and redouble efforts to cut costs.  Is that a thing? Is it normal for a board of directors to go around noisily auditioning replacements for their CEO in order to light a fire under the incumbent? It seems rather tough for the incumbent's authority, not to mention his morale. Anyway as long as Cryan is still around he is going to do what he does, which is make cuts at the investment bank, though there too Deutsche seems to be of two minds about everything:  As part of the investment bank review, cuts are being discussed at both big trading businesses -- equities as well as fixed income, currencies and commodities -- because they are expensive and haven\u2019t performed well, said one person. However, the extent of a potential retrenchment is unclear because many traders just got big bonuses in an effort to retain top performers, this person said.  I have to say that getting a big retention bonus and then immediately being laid off is ... not the worst way to go.  The crypto.  Here is a profile of Zhao Changpeng, the founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance, who spent \"several years developing trading systems for companies including Bloomberg L.P.,\" and who is now maybe a billionaire, but who has apparently never met a lawyer? Or something, I don't know, what do you make of this explanation for why Binance lists so many initial coin offerings that have characteristics of unregistered securities:  Zhao said the exchange\u2019s client identification policies are similar to those of some U.S.-based venues and that Binance takes a venture capital-like approach to evaluating the coins it lists, favoring those that are backed by teams with a track record and real products. He also asks issuers to provide Binance with a legal opinion that the coins aren\u2019t securities.  Look. The way venture capital works is that it invests in companies, specifically by buying securities of those companies. If you evaluate coins by examining their team and their products using a \"venture capital-like approach,\" that is because they are companies and they are issuing securities.  Also I have a feeling we should check in on this guy in six months:  \u201cThe less regulation, the better,\u201d said Zachary Ising, a 24-year-old graduate student at California University of Pennsylvania who relies on virtual currency trading for all his income and has a majority of his assets in a Binance account. \u201cI\u2019m confident in Binance\u2019s ability to secure its own platform.\u201d  Elsewhere: \"Russia says Venezuela has not offered to repay debts in cryptocurrency.\" And: \"Reddit Disables Bitcoin Payments.\" Honestly I didn't know that you could pay for Reddit, but if I had known that you could pay for Reddit, I'd have been pretty confident that you could pay for Reddit with Bitcoin. Now you can't.  Blockchain blockchain blockchain.  Here is \"Blockchain Technology for Corporate Governance and Shareholder Activism\" by Anne Lafarre and Christoph Van der Elst. \"Shares are usually held through complex chains of intermediaries,\" they write, and \"these intermediaries not only add transaction costs to shareholder participation per se, there is also high uncertainty that information, including the record of shareholder votes, is correctly channelled between ultimate shareholders and companies in remote participation.\" The solution is of course the blockchain:  In a private blockchain, managed by the company only accessible for shareholders for example on the Hyperledger of IBM, the company and shareholders that hold sufficient shares can place proposals. Smart contracting allows for the private ledger to be structured so that all relevant information including majority rules and access rights that are contained in the articles of association and the law are taken into account. Once a certain proposal is placed in the blockchain, shareholders that hold shares in the company are immediately notified and can exercise their voting rights during a short period. The voting results may become instantly available after a cut-off point, and majority requirements, necessary to render the decision binding and verifiable, need to be reached in a specified timeframe. Shareholders can verify their own transactions, but none of the shareholders should be able to determine what voting decision was taken by other shareholders.  Look, you know, fine. We have talked about exactly these problems -- the complex chain of intermediation in stock voting that leads to uncertainty and reduced participation -- and in fact I have even gone so far as to mutter the word \"blockchain\" in those discussions. But what if you replaced the word \"blockchain\" in the paragraph above with a word like, say, \"website\"? What if the company had a private website where it could put proposals, and a database where it tracked share ownership, and the shareholders could log in to the website and see and vote on proposals? The call here is for a private blockchain -- one administered by the company -- so the trustlessness and decentralization benefits of public blockchains are not relevant. This is just an argument that companies should have better databases for tracking their shareholders, and better user interfaces to allow those shareholders to vote their shares. The blockchain has nothing to do with it, except that people want to read about the blockchain.  Elsewhere, some of the people who piloted blockchain projects realized they were pointless:  DTCC, known as Wall Street\u2019s bookkeeper, recently put the brakes on a blockchain system for the clearing and settlement of repurchase, or repo, agreement transactions, said Murray Pozmanter, head of clearing agency services at the DTCC. The project, which had successfully tested with startup Digital Asset Holdings (DA), was shelved because banks and other potential users believed the same results could be achieved more cheaply using current technology, he said. \u201cBasically, it became a solution in search of a problem,\u201d he said.  Yes! The blockchain project worked! But also so would a database run by a trusted central counterparty such as, just to throw one name out there, DTCC. You could just about imagine someone, somewhere, saying \"the blockchain is a solution to the problem that we rely too much on DTCC to clear and settle repo trades.\" (I mean, it seems like a niche thing to worry about, but you could.) It is harder to imagine DTCC concluding that. And if DTCC is going to run a centralized blockchain, why not just run a centralized database instead?  Virtual reality.  Are we currently living in a computer simulation run for the entertainment or edification of some far more intelligent beings? Sure, why not. I have to say that the best evidence for it is that when people come up with virtual-reality projects, the reality always seems to be so grimly literal. Microsoft Corp., for instance, developed \"a digital room where we could sit at a digital desk and interact with Microsoft programs such as Word,\" which sounds a whole lot like the actual rooms at my house and my office where I sit at an actual desk and interact with Word. And if a virtual-reality desk job isn't quite existentially terrifying enough for you, now you can virtually die at your virtual-reality desk:  Visitors could don VR glasses and earphones to experience having a seizure at work, a failed paramedic rescue, and entrance into the afterlife. Funeral parlor employee Dong Ziyi told The Beijing News that the immersive experience \u201cenables people to better cherish the beauty of life.\u201d  Now we just need a virtual-reality experience of eating lunch at your desk. We really are building all the components of virtual-reality life, and death, under late capitalism. I would na\u00efvely have thought that people would build virtual reality experiences that are, you know, fun, that you can't really get in your daily life. As opposed to, like, \"do some word processing and then die at your desk.\" But I guess the fact that our simulated reality is so much like our boring reality is an argument that our boring reality is itself a simulation.

A string of executives have headed for the exits, including a surprising number from the company\u2019s finance team, as Tesla is dogged by questions about whether it can meet its production targets.  The chief financial officer left abruptly last year in a curious turn of events, where he was replaced by his predecessor: Deepak Ahuja served as Tesla\u2019s CFO from 2008 to 2015 and then took over the job again in March 2017, according to his LinkedIn. Then late last year, one of Tesla\u2019s audit committee members, Steve Jurvetson, went on leave from the board (following accusations of misconduct, which he has denied). The vice president of business development and director of battery technology both left in the past year. Jon McNeill, one of Tesla\u2019s most senior executives, went to take the chief operating officer job at Lyft Inc. last month. Eric Branderiz, Tesla\u2019s chief accounting officer, departed last week. And Bloomberg reported this week that Susan Repo, the corporate treasurer and vice president of finance, is out.  The press has rightly been focused on trying to figure out how badly Tesla will miss its production targets for the all-important Model 3 electric sedan. After all, actually building cars is pretty important to Tesla\u2019s business.  Bloomberg built a Tesla Model 3 Tracker. The data show Tesla is producing approximately 737 cars a week. In July, Tesla predicted that it would produce 5,000 Model 3s a week by the end of 2017. Oops.  Tesla has steadily rolled back its production targets and still looks like it will be behind schedule. According to Bloomberg\u2019s analysis, Tesla Model 3 output has actually slowed from February when it was producing something like 936 Model 3s a week. My colleague Dana Hull reported that Tesla temporarily suspended production in late February, potentially explaining the slowdown.  CNBC reported Wednesday that many of the vehicles coming off Tesla\u2019s assembly line required more work. One employee estimated that \u201c40 percent of the parts made or received at its Fremont factor require work,\u201d the article said. Some investors surely found Tesla\u2019s response to the article to be laughable. The company\u2019s statement reads, \u201cIn what world is the pursuit of perfection looked down on? Not one we want to live in.\u201d  Ah yes, a story about how Tesla is producing cars in an inefficient fashion is really about a company with high standards.  On Thursday, the Wall Street Journal declared it \u201cTesla\u2019s Make-Or-Break Moment.\u201d That article rightly points out that Tesla had $3.4 billion of cash at the end of 2017 and that last year it burned $1 billion a quarter. Do the math, and Tesla either needs to generate more revenue or raise more money soon.  The Journal\u2019s story observes that Tesla has a so-called Z-Score (a measure of a company\u2019s financial security) of 1.26. \u201cAny company with a score below 1.8 is considered distressed by many investors. A score of 1.0 or lower suggests bankruptcy is likely within two years,\u201d Tim Higgins and Susan Pulliam write.  The financial markets have given Tesla a long leash, but the evidence against the viability of its business continues to mount. About 23 percent of publicly traded Tesla stock is being used to bet against the automaker. That\u2019s a lot of short sellers.  Of course, Chanos has been warning against Tesla since at least October 2016. \u201cThe whole thing is just sort of this m\u00e9lange of publicly traded and privately traded science projects gone awry. So we\u2019ll see how it works out,\u201d he said at the time. Despite his years-long bets against the company, the stock has been climbing. The Tesla Hype Train keeps going.  But I have to end this piece with a necessary caveat. Despite cash flow concerns, Musk\u2019s companies have generally worked out for investors. Peter Thiel issued what has become a sort of Silicon Valley koan: \u201cNever bet against Elon.\u201d  This article also ran in Bloomberg Technology\u2019s Fully Charged newsletter. Sign up here.

Model S sedan that rear-ended a firetruck on a freeway near Los Angeles on Monday, the agency said.  The safety agency has not yet decided whether it will open a formal investigation of the crash, NTSB spokesman Chris O\u2019Neil said in an email. The safety board only investigates a handful of highway accidents each year.  The Tesla\u2019s driver said he had the vehicle\u2019s Autopilot driver-assist system engaged when it struck a firetruck at around 65 miles per hour, a union for Culver City, California firefighters said in a tweet on Monday. \"Amazingly there were no injuries! Please stay alert while driving!\" the union said in the tweet.  The firetruck was parked in an emergency lane at the side of the highway attending to another accident at the time of the morning collision, according to the Mercury News.  Tesla said in a statement that Autopilot is \u201cintended for use only with a fully attentive driver.\u201d The company said it has taken steps to educate drivers about the need to keep their hands on the steering wheel and be prepared to take over from Autopilot, which it calls an \"advanced driver assistance system\" that is not intended to turn the vehicle into an autonomous car.  The NTSB has previously said Tesla\u2019s Autopilot system was a contributing factor in a 2016 fatal crash in Florida. In that incident, a Model S driver died after the car drove underneath a semi-trailer crossing a divided road that the Autopilot\u2019s sensors failed to detect.  The NTSB criticized Tesla and other carmakers for measuring whether a driver is paying attention using steering wheel movement in a September report about the fatal 2016 Tesla crash involving Autopilot.  General Motors Co. last year began equipping some Cadillac cars with its Super Cruise system that allows for going hands-free on the highway. The system monitors whether a driver is paying attention using a small camera on the top of the steering wheel column to track head position.  \u2014 With assistance by Dana Hull", "stock": "TSLA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-01-23", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-23/tesla-crash-in-california-draws-interest-from-u-s-investigators"}, {"article": "Hitching a ride on Tesla Inc. these days seems precarious at best, especially for its sole battery supplier Panasonic Corp.  Shares of the Japanese company plunged as much as 9 percent after a spate of Tesla bad-news stories over the past few weeks. First, the U.S. electric-car maker reported yet another fatal crash, then a shortfall in production targets for its mass-market Model 3 and to top it off, a rating downgrade by Moody's Investors Service on liquidity concerns. The cost to insure Panasonic's five-year debt -- a broad gauge of risk -- has risen sharply.  That Panasonic is dancing to Tesla's tune is no big surprise -- it usually does. Investors have long seen the electronics giant as a derivative play on its U.S. customer. Their thesis: more Teslas, more batteries. To be fair, Panasonic does have solid battery technology -- better than the likes of Samsung SDI Co. -- and has focused its efforts on the auto industry. In fact, moments of weakness in Panasonic stock are often seen as an opportune time to buy. This time, there are other factors to consider.  Out of Sync Panasonic risks putting too many eggs in one basket Bloomberg  First, the level of Panasonic's reliance. The Osaka-based company revised down its sales and operating profit estimates for rechargeable batteries for the full fiscal year in February because it had to push out sales plans in North America to \u201cfuture periods.\u201d Its hyped-up gigafactory partnership with Tesla in Nevada has undershot expectations. Panasonic is piling capex into the $5 billion project, in part raising debt to do so. Moody's expects the company to shovel more than 50 percent of its capital spending into the automotive segment including battery plants.  Besides Tesla, Panasonic leans heavily on the broader electric-vehicle industry, where prospects are dimming amid the Trump administration's lackluster interest in green policies. Earlier this month, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it was revising fuel-efficiency standards that allow carmakers \"to make cars that people both want and can afford.\" That damped enthusiasm for the potential growth of electric cars.  Then, there's China, the world's largest electric-vehicle market. Panasonic, along with other foreign battery makers, risks being shut out by new-energy policies aimed at cornering the global market. China's own battery champion, Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., is shoving global competitors aside as it ramps up production and pushes down prices, while reaching standards to supply the likes of BMW AG.  Panasonic started making batteries for hybrid cars in the northeastern city of Dalian only last month, entering a market that's increasingly looking saturated as growing volumes put pressure on margins. Tesla, meanwhile, which sells in China only through exports, may also be at risk of being drawn into the ongoing trade spat with the U.S.  Ahead of the Pack Panasonic trades at a premium to its South Korea battery maker peers Bloomberg  Panasonic stock is down around 7 percent this year in Tokyo and trades at a premium to its South Korean battery peers on 14.4 times forward earnings.

GFG, which last year added steel operations to iron ore mines in Australia, said the battery will help power a 200 megawatt solar farm at its Whyalla steelworks. Simec Zen hopes its Big Battery Project will provide grid stability and act as a buffer to power outages, which have included a state-wide blackout in September 2016.  \u201cAs well as being the most powerful battery in the world, Simec Zen\u2019s storage facility will help underpin the long-term viability of the Whyalla steelworks as well as provide additional benefits to the South Australian grid,\u201d Weatherill said.

Tesla Inc. installed 87 megawatts of commercial and residential solar in the fourth quarter, including about 50 megawatts at homes, according to a GTM Research estimate. Rival Sunrun Inc. added 85 megawatts of residential systems in the same period, according to a statement Tuesday. Counting only that part of Tesla\u2019s operation, Sunrun took the lead in the third quarter.  The changing of the guard comes more than a year after Tesla bought Musk\u2019s debt-burdened SolarCity for $2 billion. Tesla has since prioritized profitability in solar over growth-at-all-costs as the company seeks to transform itself into a solar and battery giant to complement its electric vehicles. Tesla has ceded solar market-share in most quarters since that deal, and without SolarCity trumpeting solar, the U.S. residential market contracted in 2017 after at least 16 consecutive years of growth.  \u201cSolarCity was the marketing and lobbying machine for the entire industry, and everyone is struggling in its absence,\u201d said Hugh Bromley, a New York-based analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance.

Rowe Price Group Inc., which combined own about 14 percent of Tesla stock, indicated to Bloomberg News that they\u2019ll vote in favor of the board\u2019s proposal at a March 21 special meeting.  The unprecedented pay package has been criticized as too costly by proxy adviser Glass Lewis & Co., which has recommended that investors reject the plan.

The unprecedented pay package proposes Musk won\u2019t get paid unless his company\u2019s stock rises, further tying the 46-year-old chief executive officer\u2019s personal wealth to that of shareholders. It envisions a staggering increase in market value to $650 billion that would put Tesla in the league of tech giants like Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp., now more than 10 times its size. Revenue would expand to $175 billion, ahead of General Motors Co.  The move assures investors that Musk will lead Tesla through its next phase of rapid growth despite his many other commitments and interests. He is also the CEO of Space Exploration Technologies Corp. and has embarked on several other ventures including OpenAI, Neuralink and the Boring Co.  Under the plan, which requires shareholder approval in March, Musk\u2019s pay is tied strictly to stock performance and profit. He will receive no salary or bonus. A 10-year grant of stock options vests in 12 tranches that are linked to market capitalization in $50 billion increments, starting at $100 billion. There are also milestones tied to revenue and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, Tesla said in a statement.  Musk Payday 10-year pay plan means CEO could bag $56 billion -- theoretically Source: Tesla  Musk, who is already Tesla\u2019s biggest shareholder, has a net worth estimated at $21.5 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The new pay plan would add as much as $55.8 billion to that total. The company said that figure was theoretical, given the likelihood of additional employee stock awards, as well as the possibility of mergers or raising new capital.  \u201cWhile Tesla has no way of predicting how much dilution there will be, some amount of future dilution is a certainty,\u201d the company said in a filing.  The agreement requires Musk to remain as Tesla\u2019s CEO or serve as executive chairman and chief product officer -- potentially paving the way for the company to eventually hire another CEO. The plan is aimed at ensuring that Musk \u201cwill continue to lead Tesla\u2019s management over the long-term while also providing the flexibility to bring in another CEO who would report to Elon at some point in the future,\u201d the company said.  Tesla, based in Palo Alto, California, has more than 33,000 employees worldwide and recently launched the Model 3 sedan, a more affordable electric car that is the linchpin to the company\u2019s efforts to reach the mass market and profitability. Tesla, which has struggled to ramp up production of the car, no longer includes vehicle output targets in Musk\u2019s proposed compensation plan.  The company, whose stated mission \u201c is to accelerate the world\u2019s transition to sustainable energy,\u201d also sells its batteries to utilities seeking to integrate renewable forms of energy like solar and wind onto the grid. That product line is expanding to include a solar roof product for homeowners. Musk\u2019s personal brand as a futurist is deeply intertwined with the identity of the company, which has legions of fans and devoted customers but has yet to make an annual profit.  Musk\u2019s previous compensation plan was also tied to stock performance and vehicle development targets set in 2012. The carmaker was valued at $59.1 billion at the close of trading Monday. The shares have jumped 13 percent since the start of the year.

The problem is that a key to its future battery manufacturing is still in Germany.  The electric-car maker -- which still plans to make about 2,500 of the cars a week by the end of March -- designed a new automated system for module production at its battery factory near Reno, Nevada. The line is already working at Tesla\u2019s German manufacturing unit Grohmann but needs to be shipped to the U.S. next month to be put to use, Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said.  \u201cThat\u2019s got to be disassembled, brought over to the Gigafactory, and re-assembled and then brought into operation at the Gigafactory. It\u2019s not a question of whether it works or not. It\u2019s just a question of disassembly, transport and reassembly,\u201d he said on a conference call Wednesday. Once that milestone is completed, Tesla will next need to fix material-handling constraints at its Fremont, California, assembly plant before it can reach its goal to make 5,000 Model 3 sedans a week by the end of June.  Tesla has pushed back targets several times for Model 3, the more affordable car it\u2019s banking on to propel it from niche electric-car maker to more of a mass manufacturer. The slower production ramp has meant less money is coming in the door from customers taking delivery, and Wall Street is watching closely for any signs the targets could slip again.  Tesla shares fell 8.6 percent to $315.23 on Thursday in New York, the biggest one-day drop since June 2016.  Positive News  Other aspects of Tesla\u2019s latest quarterly loss were more positive. The company\u2019s cash balance barely budged in the last three months of the year even as it struggled to make Model 3 sedans.  Paying customers are supporting Tesla through its production struggle -- they\u2019ve put down more than $850 million in deposits for vehicles including the Semi truck and Roadster sports car Musk showed off in November.  \u201cThe business is complex, and there\u2019s almost always something for bears to focus on. But in Q4, we think most of the news was positive,\u201d Piper Jaffray analyst Alexander Potter wrote in a report.  While it\u2019s going to take time to get Model 3 production to targeted levels, the chief executive officer of both Tesla and Space Exploration Technologies Corp. has succeeded in captivating consumers in the meantime. Musk\u2019s latest promotional stunt involved firing off a sports car into the sky atop the world\u2019s most powerful rocket.  \u201cIf we can send a Roadster to the asteroid belt, we can probably solve Model 3 production,\u201d Musk said on the conference call with analysts, shortly after tweeting another photo of his Roadster hurtling through space.  Unconventional Fundraising Tesla's customer deposits jumped in fourth quarter amid Semi truck, Roadster reveals Source: Company statements  Tesla has said it\u2019s putting off spending to double its production rate to 10,000 Model 3s until it reaches the 5,000 unit milestone. It also deferred some Model 3-related capital expenditures in the fourth quarter, which \u201cdressed up the cash flow,\u201d Cowen\u2019s Osborne said.  A closely watched figure indicating how much money Tesla is using up -- negative free cash flow -- was just $277 million in the fourth quarter, the lowest in more than a year.  Easing Concerns  \u201cAll the cash concerns will be alleviated once they get these cars on the road,\u201d said Tasha Keeney, an analyst at ARK Investment Management, which holds Tesla stock.  Tesla is still far from being in the clear with regards to cash. The company finished the fourth quarter with about $3.4 billion, and it\u2019s planning slightly more than $3.4 billion in capital expenditures this year after spending that much in 2017.  Some of the expenditures planned for this year are linked to what\u2019s coming next to Tesla\u2019s lineup. In addition to the Semi going into production in 2019 and the Roadster coming in 2020, Tesla plans to add a crossover called the Model Y.  Tesla will announce the location for where it\u2019ll build that in three to six months, with capital spending toward the vehicle starting later this year.  The company expects to deliver about 100,000 Model S sedans and Model X sport utility vehicles, in line with last year\u2019s 101,312.  The department tasked with pulling that off will now be reporting directly to the CEO after Lyft Inc. hired away Jon McNeill, who had been president of global sales and service at Tesla and an influential figure at the company.

Elon Musk, in a testy Twitter exchange, said he is \u201cback to sleeping at the factory\u201d while trying to fix production delays with the Model 3 electric car. It\u2019s a move reminiscent of Tesla\u2019s last vehicle launch\u2014the Model X\u2014when Musk famously kept a sleeping bag near the production line so he could immediately address any hiccups.  \u201cCar biz is hell,\u201d Musk said.  The posts on Twitter came as investors await Tesla\u2019s first-quarter production numbers, which are expected to fall short of company forecasts. The exchange, with a reporter at the Information, a tech and business news site, followed a story by the outlet that Musk had taken over Model 3 production from Tesla\u2019s head of engineering, Doug Field.  For the past year, Field has managed engineering of both the vehicle and its production. Musk said Field had originally been tasked with both jobs to ensure Tesla doesn\u2019t design cars that are \u201ccrazy hard to build,\u201d but now that the company was back in the thick of production, \u201cit\u2019s better to divide and conquer.\u201d  Tesla Inc. is under enormous pressure to build the Model 3 fast enough to meet customer demand\u2014and to bring in revenue to offset billions of dollars spent preparing for its rollout. An experimental tracking model developed by Bloomberg estimates that Tesla was able to produce 9,285 Model 3s for the quarter and achieved a final burst of production of as many as 2,200 cars a week. Musk had vowed to reach 2,500 a week by the end of the first quarter\u2014a target that was already scaled back from a prior forecast of 5,000 a week by the end of 2017.  See more about the Bloomberg Model 3 Tracker here.  Tesla has built up a die-hard fan base, with some half a million people putting down $1,000 reservations for the Model 3 since it was unveiled two years ago. But the company is still trying to prove it has what it takes to be a true mass-production company. Tesla reports production and delivery results within a few days of each quarter ending.  When Tesla rolled out the Model X in late 2015, it was years behind schedule, and production was marred by problems with its complicated falcon wing doors, custom mono-post rear seats and other unique new high-tech features. Musk told investors in 2016 that he kept a sleeping bag on hand and moved his desk to wherever the factory problems were most troublesome.  It\u2019s not clear where Tesla\u2019s current bottlenecks reside. During a first-quarter earnings call, Musk said the primary holdup was with robots at the company\u2019s battery Gigafactory near Reno, Nevada. A new production line had been built for it at Tesla\u2019s Grohmann Automation labs in Germany and was scheduled to be installed at the Gigafactory last month. If Musk is instead camping out at the automaker\u2019s Fremont, California, car factory, that would suggest his attention has shifted away from the batteries to car assembly. Tesla wants to double production in the next three months, to 5,000 cars a week. Fremont is where that will, or won\u2019t, happen.  Even if Tesla reaches its first-quarter production target, it\u2019s not clear whether the company will be able to sustain and build off of it. According to Musk\u2019s latest posts on Twitter, the company hasn\u2019t emerged from production hell just yet.

On Thursday evening, Tesla filed with regulators to disclose precisely this:  On March 7, 2018, Eric Branderiz left Tesla for personal reasons. Tesla appreciates Eric's service to the company.  Brevity, the soul of wit, is perhaps the specter of foreboding in this case. Branderiz was hired from SunPower Corp. in October 2016 to be Tesla's corporate controller and chief accountant. His base salary was $300,000 a year, but the real draw was a $5 million equity grant to vest over four years. To be clear, I don't know what his personal reasons are. Regardless, that vesting schedule suggests he's leaving a chunk of money on the table.  He isn't the only high-profile departure. The last one was announced a month ago on Tesla's earnings call by none other than CEO Elon Musk, with not just brevity but a hint of insouciance:  Actually, one thing we forgot to mention is John McNeill, who is heading up our sales and service group, is departing the company. We wish him well in his future career. And going forward, I will be having the sales and service report directly to me. There are no plans to search for a replacement.  Just the guy running the sales effort during possibly the most critical launch of a Tesla vehicle yet. No biggie.  Actually, that is kind of how the bond market seems to be taking it. Those bonds mentioned above are now yielding about 6.3 percent, a full percentage point above their coupon. But the spreads betray a more laid-back attitude:  So? Tesla's bond yield is up but that's down to Treasuries selling off rather than a blowout in spreads Source: Bloomberg  These spreads actually looked low even before the news of Branderiz's departure, considering Tesla's growing reliance on negative working capital to fund its operations (see this) and its net debt doubling last year to $6.8 billion (see this).  There's more to be found off the balance sheet, too. According to Tesla's annual filing, which dropped a couple of weeks ago, it's potentially on the hook for an estimated $8.5 billion of contracted purchases over the next three years alone. Most of this relates to batteries coming from Panasonic Corp. and emphasizes the importance of Model 3 production catching up with the vast ambitions set ahead of it.  Much Obliged Tesla's contractual obligations, related mainly to battery purchases, are bigger than its long-term debt Source: Company filing  That fixed-income investors are fine with this is, of course, a function of their primary defense; namely, Tesla's gravity-defying stock price. The potential for an eighth equity sale to refill company coffers serves to salve any wounds inflicted by slipping Model 3 targets or senior managers sipping away. In early trading on Friday morning, the shares were down less than 1 percent.  Like I Said: So? Tesla's share price shrugs off setbacks with remarkable ease Source: Bloomberg  What might cause the market's confidence to crack? It's impossible to say, though the Model 3's woes represent the most acute threat. We are now just over three weeks away from the March 31 deadline to get weekly production up to 2,500; a target that's been reset several times already. Bloomberg's own tracker estimates the current rate at less than 700.  It's worth pointing out that Adam Jonas, Morgan Stanley's usually bullish analyst on Tesla, on Friday morning issued a new report that offered a curious cocktail combining optimism about the company overcoming its immediate problems with the notion that investors might use that outcome to \"exit\" the stock. The rationale is that even if Tesla gets the Model 3 going, competitive pressure and vast infrastructure needs to realize the company's ambitions will constrain it. As Jonas puts it:  We had harbored greater conviction on the long side, as we felt that investors underestimated the scope of the addressable market and the value of Tesla\u2019s platform (hardware, software, people, physical infrastructure and network effect).

But now, after a spate of fresh setbacks in the past week, including a fatal Tesla crash and a credit-rating downgrade, bondholders are asking hard questions about whether Musk can deliver on his bold promise to bring electric cars to the masses before the company runs out of cash.

But surging borrowing costs, which are now near 8 percent, could hamper the carmaker\u2019s ability to finance itself at a critical time.  For Bloomberg\u2019s Tesla Model 3 production tracker, click here.  A representative for Tesla didn\u2019t immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.  The company, which has never shown an annual profit in the 15 years since it was founded, will need to raise over $2 billion to cover not only its cash burn this year, but also about $1.2 billion of debt that comes due by 2019, Moody\u2019s Investors Service analyst Bruce Clark said in a report Tuesday.  Tesla is burning through money so fast that, without additional financing, it would run out of cash before year-end. To put that into perspective, that amounts to more than $6,500 every minute of every day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  \u2018Crunch Time\u2019  That puts the company in \u201ccrunch time\u201d now to improve margins, Cowen & Co. analysts led by Jeffrey Osborne said in a note Tuesday.

The Tesla Model 3. Photographer: Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg  \u201cBased on our own checks as well as user reported registration data found online, Tesla\u2019s model 3 ramp is likely still moving slower than management\u2019s previously pushed out targets,\u201d Osborne wrote.  Another production miss wouldn\u2019t make it any easier for Tesla to persuade bond investors to hand over more money.

But he didn\u2019t rule out handing over the CEO responsibilities if a suitable successor would appear, allowing him to focus on \u201cdesign and engineering, which is what I like doing best.\u201d  Musk is also the CEO of Mars-bound Space Exploration Technologies Corp. and has embarked on several other projects of late, including tunnel digger Boring Co. and a brain-computer interface startup called Neuralink. The new award -- which was approved at Tesla\u2019s special meeting in Fremont, California -- requires Musk remain at the electric-car maker either as CEO or executive chairman and chief product officer.  Tesla said in a filing that about 73 percent of the votes cast in person or by proxy at the meeting were in favor of the award, excluding those owned directly or indirectly by Musk and his brother, Kimbal.  Profit Ahead?  Tesla shares traded higher following news of the vote. The stock closed up 1.9 percent in New York. A spokesman for the company declined to comment.  The pay plan helps ensure Musk will remain at Tesla at least until 2028, but several questions loom. The award contains a number of audacious goals and no detailed plan of how to get there, including when the manufacturer will turn its first-ever annual profit. Additionally, a series of executive exits in the past year has left Tesla without a clear No. 2 -- a potential concern even if Musk stays front and center.  This quarter alone, Tesla has lost Jon McNeill, president of sales and service; its accounting chief Eric Branderiz; and Susan Repo, corporate treasurer and vice president of finance. Going back a full year, Tesla has also lost executives including Chief Financial Officer Jason Wheeler; Chris Lattner, an Apple Inc. hire who left after leading Tesla\u2019s Autopilot engineering team for less than six months; Kurt Kelty, a senior battery executive; and Diarmuid O\u2019Connell, vice president of business development.  Jamie Albertine, analyst at Consumer Edge Research, said he sees Tesla needing to hire a chief operating officer or a new head of service \u201cat some point in the near future.\u201d Musk said on the earnings call last month that McNeill\u2019s department would report directly to him and that \u201cthere are no plans to search for a replacement,\u201d even as some investors fear he\u2019s spreading himself too thin. In 2016, Musk said he was working so hard, he kept a sleeping bag in a conference room adjacent to Tesla\u2019s production line in Fremont.  Billionaire Bait  The award, which won\u2019t vest unless a set of ambitious financial goals are met, had been cheered by some large Tesla investors who said it would help the CEO drive the business forward. Critics, including the two largest proxy advisers, said it was too costly and questioned why Musk, a billionaire who has about half his wealth tied up in company stock, needed more equity to stay motivated.  The board needed majority approval to make the grant, which likely is the largest one-time compensation deal ever awarded. Tesla had said Musk and his brother, who\u2019s a company director, wouldn\u2019t vote their shares.  Tesla Targets Musk's award will pay when Tesla hits pairs of goals, with one tied to market value Source: Proxy filing  Under the new plan, Musk will earn one-12th of the options every time Tesla hits a pair of goals: one tied to its market value and the other linked to either revenue or earnings excluding certain charges. For Musk to get all the options, Tesla would have to become worth $650 billion -- more than Facebook Inc. -- and produce more revenue than Procter & Gamble Co.  Tesla has said in regulatory filings that Musk\u2019s award could yield him more than $50 billion if all goals are achieved. Some investors have said the package aligns with their interests, signaling they don\u2019t mind if Musk gets wealthier, as long as they also see big returns.  Ross Gerber tweet to Elon Musk and Tesla Inc. Source: @GerberKawasaki/Twitter Inc.  Large shareholders including Baillie Gifford & Co. and T. Rowe Price Group Inc. signaled ahead of the vote that they would probably support the package. Spokesmen for Baillie Gifford and Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. were not immediately available to comment. T. Rowe Price and shareholder Fidelity, which holds almost 10 percent of Tesla stock, declined to comment.  Potential Dilution  California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, the second-largest pension fund in the U.S., didn\u2019t support the plan, citing concerns about potential dilution and an absence of profitability goals. Large stock awards can be costly for investors in two ways: They can increase a company\u2019s expenses and they dilute the stakes of existing shareholders.  Still, Calstrs is appreciative of Musk\u2019s \u201cvisionary leadership,\u201d Anne Sheehan, director of corporate governance at the fund, said in an emailed statement.

Tesla's semi-autonomous driver assist system that handles some tasks and allows drivers under certain conditions to take their hands off the wheel.  The system requires drivers to keep their hands on the steering wheel, and emits escalating alerts if they don't.  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said on Tuesday it was sending two investigators to examine the crash of a Tesla vehicle apparently traveling in semi-autonomous mode and a fire truck in California.  In a post on Twitter, the federal safety agency said the \"field investigation\" would examine both driver and vehicle factors in Monday's accident.  This is the second time the safety board has probed a Tesla crash that may be linked to Autopilot, Tesla's semi-autonomous driver assist system that handles some tasks and allows drivers under certain conditions to take their hands off the wheel for extended periods.  The Culver City, California fire department said in a Twitter post that on Monday an engine was struck by a Tesla \"traveling at 65 mph. The driver reports the vehicle was on Autopilot. Amazingly there were no injuries.\"  The NTSB faulted Tesla in a prior fatal Autopilot crash.  In September, the NTSB chairman said \"operational limitations\" in the Tesla Model S played a \"major role\" in a May 2016 crash that killed a driver using the vehicle's semi-autonomous system.  The limits on the system include factors such as Tesla being unable to ensure driver attention even when the car is traveling at high speeds, ensuring Autopilot is used only on certain roads and monitoring driver engagement, NTSB said in September.  The NTSB recommended auto safety regulators and automakers take steps to ensure that semi-autonomous systems are not misused.  \"System safeguards were lacking,\" NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said.  Tesla declined to comment Tuesday on the new probe. In September the company said, \"Autopilot significantly increases safety,\" citing an earlier government study that suggested the system reduced the incidence of crashes.  The company has emphasized that \"Autopilot is not a fully self-driving technology and drivers need to remain attentive at all times.\"  Joshua Brown, a 40-year-old Ohio man, was killed near Williston, Florida, when his Model S collided with a truck while it was engaged in the Autopilot mode.  The fatal incident raised questions about the safety of systems that can perform driving tasks for extended stretches of time with little or no human intervention, but which cannot completely replace human drivers.  The NTSB said Tesla could have taken further steps to prevent the system's misuse, and faulted the driver for not paying attention. The agency said the Autopilot system operated as designed but did not ensure drivers paid adequate attention.

Earth is the bright crescent seen in the background. Elon Musk/SpaceX via Instagram  SpaceX, founded by Elon Musk, recently launched the world's largest operational rocket on February 6.  Falcon Heavy's launch sent Musk's personal 2008 red Tesla Roadster on a voyage toward Mars orbit with a \"Starman\" dummy in the driver's seat.  Planetary scientists are concerned about bacterial contamination on Musk's car in case it crashes into Mars \u2014 a planet that may host alien microbes.  However, new calculations show the Tesla will most likely hit Earth, Venus, or the sun.  On February 6, SpaceX launched the world's most powerful operational rocket, called Falcon Heavy, for the first time.  The launch sent company founder Elon Musk's own red Tesla Roadster on a path that crosses the orbit of Mars. This attracted the attention of researchers worried about an eventual crash into the red planet, which would contaminate the world \u2014 and any alien microbes living there.  But planetary science researchers can now breathe a little easier, if a new study about the Roadster's fate is correct.  Musk put his Roadster on top of the 230-foot-tall rocket with a spacesuit-clad dummy named \"Starman\" in the driver's seat. Launching the car demonstrated Falcon Heavy's capabilities and was reportedly a backup plan for a scientific NASA or military payload.  The Roadster's short-lived yet unparalleled camera feeds, overall silliness (as Musk has described it), and far-flung path through space captured global attention.  But not all of it has proved welcome.  SpaceX founder Elon Musk in a press conference after the launch of Falcon Heavy. Dave Mosher/Business Insider The Planetary Society's Jason Davis bemoaned the planetary protection risk posed by Musk's un-sterilized car crashing into Mars and sprinkling debris coated with bacteria, viruses, and fungi all over the planet. The reason: alien microbes may be hiding out in Martian soil.  \"NASA goes to great lengths sterilizing spacecraft designed to land on Mars, in order to make sure there's no chance of Earthly microbes contaminating the surface,\" Davis wrote in a post before launch. \"Such a contamination could harm existing life and muddle scientific efforts to search for said life.\"  But that risk now appears minimal, according to a new scientific study titled \"The random walk of cars and their collision probabilities with planets.\"  Three researchers at the University of Toronto posted their paper on Tuesday to the pre-print arXiv server and submitted to the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.  Where and when Musk's Tesla will most likely crash  A chart showing the location of Elon Musk's Tesla Roadster in space on February 15, 2018. WhereIsTesla.com  Hanno Rein, an astrophysicist and lead author of the study, said the roughly week-long research came out of advanced orbital-mechanics computer simulations.  \"Earth is the most likely place the car will crash, followed by Venus, and then the sun,\" Rein told Business Insider, and likely within 10 million years \u2014 not hundreds of millions or possibly billions, as Musk has suggested.  To arrive at that conclusion, Rein and his colleagues started with orbital tracking data for the Roadster posted by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Then they plugged that data into simulation software called REBOUND, which allowed them to fast-forward the car's likeliest orbital paths through the solar system over the next few million years.  That data suggest Musk's car will fly out past Mars orbit, spending very little time there, and then swing back around, over and over again.  \"Every 30 years or so, it will come relatively close to the Earth,\" Rein said, where it will get a gravitational tug. \"This causes a change of a few percent in some of the orbital parameters. The distance to the sun would change slightly, for example, and the orbit's eccentricity.\"  The calculations suggest the Roadster will come within one Earth-moon distance of our planet within 100 years, possibly enabling new Earth-based telescope views.  Elon Musk's red Tesla Roadster before launching on a Falcon Heavy rocket toward Mars orbit. Elon Musk/SpaceX; Instagram  But after its third flyby, Rein said the Roadster will take on an increasingly chaotic and somewhat unpredictable path through space. That's because those gravitational tugs near Earth's orbit \u2014 where the car will spend most of its time compared to other bodies in the system \u2014 can \"lead to a huge change afterward,\" Rein said.  By running hundreds of different simulations of those orbital possibilities out to 3.5 million years from today, Rein and his colleagues figured out there's a 6% chance of the Roadster crashing into Earth and a 2.5% chance of crashing into Venus during that time.  \"We've not seen any single collision with Mars in 240 simulations, though we continue to run them and see what happens,\" Rein said. \"The likely outcome is that it will crash, in tens of millions of years, into Earth or Venus or the sun.\"  Astronomers are tracking the car in space  Two other astronomers \u2014 Gianluca Masi of The Virtual Telescope Project and Michael Schwartz of Tenagra Observatories, Ltd. \u2014 also used JPL data to track the Roadster.  Last week, they managed to photograph the car flying beyond the moon moving at a speed of roughly 25,000 miles per hour.  The vehicle is reflective enough to see through a telescope, at least for now, leading to what they called a \"stunning\" animation of several images.  Masi said he and Schwartz will continue to track the Roadster for as long as possible.  \"The object is slowly fading: you can image it now with a 6\" or so scope,\" Masi told Business Insider in an email. \"In one month or so it will need a much larger scope to be imaged (16\" or larger).\"", "stock": "TSLA", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-15", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://uk.businessinsider.com/starman-elon-musk-car-orbit-collision-risk-calculations-2018-2"}, {"article": "Tesla Model 3.

Justin Sullivan/Getty Images  The idea that Apple should buy Tesla has been floated many times.  Apple now has more than enough cash coming back to the US to do the deal.  Tesla needs to be saved from its delusional idea about the company's future growth \u2014 and Apple needs to be saved from the disaster of its car project.  Last November, Rolling Stone published a profile of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, written by Neil Strauss, a neo-gonzo journalist who made his name with a book about pickup culture. And in that interview Musk made a confession.  \"I wish we could be private with Tesla,\" Musk told Strauss. \"It actually makes us less efficient to be a public company.\"  Tesla has been public since its 2010 IPO and since then the stock has risen from about $20 a share to nearly $400 at one point in 2017. The company's market cap is now close to $60 billion. Investors who jumped in seven years ago have enjoyed a return of nearly 1,200%.  Musk might be the only person who wishes Tesla were private. Even short-sellers, recently clobbered by Tesla's surge, have been delighted when the stock has gone through one of its periodic swoons of $100 in a few months. And ironically, Musk's next ten years of compensation are now completely tied to Tesla's market performance, which the board of directors thinks can yield a $650-billion market cap.  That's delusional. In many ways, it sets Musk up for both continued inefficiency \u2014 a lot of second-guessing about investments in automation, for example, at the expense of hitting production targets \u2014 and potentially epic failure. It also represents a radical formulation of shareholder value theory.  Tesla is wildly overvalued, and what it needs now isn't a fatter stock price but rather an ability to satisfy customers. For the Model 3 mass-market vehicle, currently stalled amid production bottlenecks, Tesla has 400,000 mostly unfulfilled pre-orders.  Apple buying Tesla is an idea that always seems to be on the table  Apple CEO Tim Cook. Getty  In the past, there's been talk about somebody buying Tesla. Usually, Apple is the one that gets everybody's heart racing. I've shot down this idea several times. But with the announcement of Musk's new pay package, I think Tesla needs to be rescued from itself. And that Musk should get his wish.  Tesla is worth so much that there aren't very many companies able to buy the automaker. And Tesla going truly private would be too much of a reversal of history as well as a financial improbability, although if the bottom falls out some investors might someday snap up what's left of Tesla on the cheap.  Apple, thanks to the new tax bill, will repatriate over $250 billion is cash that it has been keeping overseas. Even after paying taxes on it, at the reduced corporate rate, it will have arguably too much left over. It could easily wind up going into share buybacks or a dividend, or Apple could continue its pattern of making small acquisitions.  Or the company, which is sitting on a mature iPhone business that mints the profits but could be looking at more severe growth headwinds in coming years, could swing for the fences and get a piece of the multi-trillion global transportation industry. If Tim Cook agrees with the Tesla board that the company will be worth $650 billion in a decade, then buying Tesla now would be a staggering bargain.  The obvious question is, \"Who would be Tesla's CEO?\" Musk's pay package is designed to ensure that it's him, an extreme evolution of addressing the \"great man\" risk that companies led by visionary founders face. But Musk is also running SpaceX and he's on the verge of launching a huge rocket that could pave the way for a Mars mission. Dealing with Tesla's difficulties could be seen as a needless distraction.  That said, Musk could remain CEO of Tesla as an independent business unit of Apple, while Tim Cook would run the entire show (Musk could also relinquish the CEO title but continue as chairman of the board). In a way, Cook isn't really a CEO in the Musk/Steve Jobs vein anyway. He's more like a mega-COO.  And that's just what Tesla actually needs right now. If it was Jobs who rescued Apple and put it on the path that led to the iPod and the iPhone, it was Cook who turned the company into the profit-making colossus it has become. The guy is a supply-chain genius. Making stuff is his bag. And at the moment, Tesla is struggling mightily to make stuff, falling well behind its ambitious production targets for the Model 3 mass-market vehicle.  Tesla would also witness its cash-burn challenges \u2014 over $1 billion per quarter \u2014 vanish. Apple could fund losses for years.  Tesla could help Apple get into the car business The Apple Car project isn't going well. Apple  Apple has a history of falling into innovations troughs. It's in one now, following the monumental success of the iPhone. The Apple Watch hasn't been a gamechanger, and the company is chasing Amazon on smart speakers. Apple clearly wants to do something in the transportation space, but thus far its efforts have been at best confused and at worst pathetic.  Buying Tesla would change that overnight. The Apple Car, really, is a Tesla car anyway. The whole philosophy behind Tesla's vehicles, and especially the ultra-minimalist Model 3, is Apple-esque. The wait for the Apple Car would be immediately over.  And that would enable Apple to focus on bringing to Tesla what Apple's engineers and designers are now probably working on: an entirely new vehicle interface \u2014 an operating system for the car of the future.  Tesla has aspects of such a system in place, from over-the-air software updates to an increasing focus on single screens for all vehicle operations. Apple would enhance and unify these components and transform them into something unexpected. This is Apple's mojo: take something that works and make it much, much better.  Missing out on a mega-return \u2014 but one that isn't likely  Tesla market cap has become epic. Andy Kiersz/Business Insider  For investors, of course, Apple buying Tesla would eliminate any chance of a mega-return. But I think the odds are low that the 1,000%-plus payback of the past seven years will be matched by another 1,000% surge over the next ten years (Tesla is, after all, 14 years old \u2014 hardly a startup). If Tesla stays public, stockholders will also have to put up with numerous, diluting capital raises and the ever-present threat that Tesla's lack of cash and debt burden will lead to a bankruptcy.  If Apple bought Tesla, the carmaker's growth would be piped into Apple shares, and Tesla investors would certainly get a premium for their holdings, as Apple can afford to overpay. I don't even think that government regulators would have issues with the merger. Sure, Apple would be buying the dominant electric-car manufacturer. But as of 2018, the EV market makes up only 1% of global sales.  I would have stuck to my guns on the foolishness of an Apple acquisition of Tesla were it not for the reckless pay package that Tesla concocted for Musk. But I now think that Tesla is fueling a dangerous idea about the company's capabilities. Somebody needs to save Tesla from its hubris. That somebody is Apple.", "stock": "TSLA", "label": 1, "date": "2018-01-27", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/why-apple-should-buy-tesla-2018-1"}, {"article": "Markets Insider  Waymo on Tuesday announced a 20,000-vehicle deal to use Jaguar's Tesla competitor for self-driving cars.

Jaguar's I-PACE, which the British automaker revealed earlier this month, is its first fully electric vehicle \u2014 and is designed to directly compete with rivals like Tesla and Porsche in the luxury electric-vehicle market. I-PACE can rack up 240 miles on a single charge, compared to the Model X's 295.

Musk's new compensation plan scraps any promise to hit vehicle production goals, which Tesla has always fallen short of.  An analyst predicted that Tesla could build 100,000 new Model S cars in 2018, versus 400,000 preorders.  LONDON \u2014 Tesla on Tuesday announced a new compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk, and he will not get paid a single dollar unless his company's shareholders do extremely well.  Perhaps unfortunately for the 400,000 or so people who have preordered a Tesla electric vehicle, Musk's compensation won't be tied to his company's ability to build cars.  Tesla has a history of struggling with production and has missed key targets. For example, after Musk said Tesla aimed to produce 20,000 Model 3 vehicles a month by this past December, the company delivered only 1,550 in the entire fourth quarter. Musk has also said he wants to build 500,000 vehicles this year, but that now seems unlikely given the now delayed production of the Model 3.  An analyst note from December projected just 100,000 Model S Teslas coming off the line in 2018.  Tesla's stock has continued to outpace its competitors', soaring by over 1,000% since the carmaker went public in 2010.  Rather than focus on building cars, as GM and Ford do, Musk's new compensation schedule is \"entirely contingent on achieving market cap and operational milestones that would make Tesla one of the most valuable companies in the world,\" according to a press release.  For Musk's compensation to fully vest, \"Tesla's market cap would have to grow to $650 billion (an increase of almost $600 billion), and important revenue and profitability goals would also have to be achieved,\" the company said.  \"Elon will receive no guaranteed compensation of any kind \u2014 no salary, no cash bonuses, and no equity that vests simply by the passage of time,\" the release continued.  Is Tesla a car company?  Tesla  Musk's previous compensation plan included vehicle-production targets alongside milestones in increasing market capitalization, but that clause has been dropped from the new plan.  Tesla did mention plans to build \"the company's vehicle product line to cover all major forms of terrestrial transport,\" as well as \"expanding solar energy generation through Solar Roof and other solar products and seamlessly integrating them with battery storage,\" but made no direct mention of increasing car production or reliability.

The board unveiled a pay deal for Elon Musk, the chief executive, on Tuesday that will make him nearly $60 billion if he hits new targets by 2028. That\u2019s on top of the $100 billion gain the electric-car pioneer would make on his existing stake.  Mr. Musk\u2019s new targets are even more ambitious than the 10-year goals from 2012 that he blew through years early. The potential value of share grants totaling 12 percent of the company is vast, but at least the Tesla board has done much more than the usual lip service in setting a serious challenge.  It involves Mr. Musk hitting two sets of metrics. First, Tesla\u2019s market capitalization has to reach $650 billion \u2014 more than 10 times its current level and a valuation that would be fourth among today\u2019s publicly listed companies behind Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft, and just ahead of Amazon.  Second, he must turbocharge Tesla\u2019s financial performance. That requires either growing annual revenue to $175 billion, almost 15 times 2017\u2019s expected top line, or making $14 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a figure that may come in at just over $500 million for last year. There are 12 steps along the route to the maximum payout.  Reaching the revenue target could mean selling well over 2 million of Tesla\u2019s current and planned vehicles, Breakingviews calculates. That level of sales would be in the same ballpark as BMW \u2014 and last year\u2019s total for Tesla was barely over 100,000 vehicles. That doesn\u2019t allow for any surge in the company\u2019s solar-panel and electric-storage business, which at present contributes a single-digit percentage to the top line. Still, to get close would require Tesla to dominate the market for electric cars even as General Motors, Nissan and others ramp up their efforts.  One model for Musk could be Amazon, whose $177 billion of expected 2017 revenue would mark a 12-fold increase from 2007. Founder Jeff Bezos\u2019s stock has surged to 18 times its value a decade ago. Yet at the level that Mr. Musk is now aiming for, financial incentives can lose meaning. With a 20 percent stake already worth $12 billion, hitting his targets may motivate the entrepreneur more powerfully than money.", "stock": "TSLA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-01-23", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/23/business/dealbook/elon-musk-tesla-pay.html"}, {"article": "Tesla has set a dozen targets, each $50 billion more than the next, starting at $100 billion, then $150 billion, then $200 billion and so on, all the way to a market value of $650 billion. In addition, the company has set a dozen revenue and adjusted profit goals. Mr. Musk would receive 1.68 million shares, or about 1 percent of the company, only after he reaches milestones for both.  But to put these numbers in perspective, Tesla is worth only about $59 billion today.  If Mr. Musk were somehow to increase the value of Tesla to $650 billion \u2014 a figure many experts would contend is laughably impossible and would make Tesla one of the five largest companies in the United States, based on current valuations \u2014 his stock award could be worth as much as $55 billion (assuming the company does not issue any more shares over the next decade, which is unrealistic). Even reaching several of the milestones would bring him billions.  Mr. Musk\u2019s critics \u2014 and there are many \u2014 are likely to contend that the new compensation plan is just the company\u2019s latest publicity stunt. He has been called a modern-day P.T. Barnum who has created the illusion of success while consistently missing production estimates. The company continues to lose money; at one point last year, it was losing almost a half-million dollars an hour, according to Bloomberg News. Jim Chanos, a short-seller who has bet against Tesla\u2019s shares \u2014 and has thus far been on the losing side of that trade \u2014 has contended that Tesla is worthless.  But Mr. Musk\u2019s compensation plan is no illusion: He gets paid only if the company succeeds over the long term with significant gains in market cap. And it\u2019s impossible for him to manipulate the system by trying to prop up the stock price for a temporary period. Under the terms of the arrangement, even once his shares vest, he has to hold them an additional five years before he is allowed to sell them.  The way the arrangement is structured, each milestone is a blunt instrument: He either reaches it or gets nothing.  \u201cIf all that happens over the next 10 years is that Tesla\u2019s value grows by 80 or 90 percent, then my amount of compensation would be zero,\u201d he said. (His calculations were based on the stock price at the beginning of this year when the company was worth about $50 billion.)  Still, he contended, \u201cI actually see the potential for Tesla to become a trillion-dollar company within a 10-year period.\u201d  Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Many other companies have installed outsize packages that often come at the expense of shareholders because the executives get paid even when they underperform their peers.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Asked how he thinks shareholders should feel about Mr. Musk\u2019s new pay package, Ira Ehrenpreis, chairman of Tesla\u2019s compensation committee, told me, \u201cIt\u2019s heads you win, tails you don\u2019t lose,\u201d meaning if Mr. Musk is gaining billions then shareholders are winning, too. And if Mr. Musk does not perform, shareholders pay nothing.  Mr. Musk\u2019s new compensation plan is similar to the previous one put in place when the company was worth $3.2 billion in 2012. Only now, the numbers are much larger. That package also paid Mr. Musk only when he reached certain market value and operational benchmarks. And virtually nobody could imagine Tesla would be worth 17 times what it was back then.  Mr. Musk has reached all but one of the metrics in that plan.  Even though Mr. Musk\u2019s shares have vested, he has not sold them except to pay the taxes on the grants. His current stake is worth $13 billion.  Mr. Musk does not take a salary, although under California State law, Tesla is required to pay him at least minimum wage. Tesla sends him checks that pay him a little more than $37,000 annually. \u201cI don\u2019t cash it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just ends up accumulating in a Tesla bank account somewhere.\u201d  To afford to live, Mr. Musk has borrowed against his shares, a practice that some corporate executives have questioned. Mr. Musk insists that the loans are such a small portion of his stake in the company that even if Tesla shares were to fall precipitously, it would not impact him or the company.  If Mr. Musk succeeds in hitting some of his benchmarks, it would also mean that the company\u2019s employees, including those who work on the factory floor, who get paid in both cash and stock, could become wealthy.  Under the terms of the deal, which is subject to shareholder approval, Mr. Musk has to remain the company\u2019s chief executive, though the agreement would allow him to become chief product officer and executive chairman with a chief executive reporting to him. He said he saw that as a possibility only if the company became so large that he needed to recruit a top person to oversee the operations.  Mr. Musk has often said he is not driven by money. So what is it about this incentive plan that appeals to him?  \u201cNone of it is intended for dynastic wealth creation,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reason that it\u2019s important to me personally is that there\u2019s some pretty big things that I want to do.\u201d  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  \u201cI want to contribute as much as possible to humanity becoming a multi-planet species,\u201d he said, alluding to a goal he has talked about often, including having people live on Mars. \u201cThat obviously requires a certain amount of capital.\u201d", "stock": "TSLA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-01-23", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/23/business/dealbook/tesla-elon-musk-pay.html"}, {"article": "Still, Amazon cannot quietly hope that such criticism just fades away. Amazon\u2019s rapid growth, immense bargaining power, eye-catching initiatives and estimated 44 percent share of U.S. e-commerce sales make the company vulnerable to accusations that it is too powerful.  But if the Trump administration pursues ways to curtail the company, it would meet sizable obstacles.  Amazon accounts for only 4 percent of all retail sales in the United States, a recent survey estimated. Its revenue is a third of Walmart\u2019s and, even after its acquisition of Whole Foods, Amazon\u2019s footing in the grocery business is still small.  All in all, it would be hard to show that Amazon is pushing prices higher for consumers.

When the Department of Justice\u2019s antitrust lawyers went after the proposed merger of Time Warner and AT&T, it was not targeting companies that were particularly popular with the public.  Still, some Amazon critics see a possible, though small, opening. In theory, an antitrust case could focus on the firms that supply Amazon with goods, according to Christopher L. Sagers, a law professor at Cleveland State University. If a company consistently uses its power to demand a good from suppliers at too low a price, the public could still get hurt. That\u2019s because the supply of the good could decline, its quality degrade, and there may be less innovation in the sector that produces the good, Mr. Sagers said.

Axios reported on Wednesday that Mr. Trump has wondered aloud whether Amazon could be vulnerable to antitrust or competition laws.  \u201cTrump\u2019s wealthy friends tell him Amazon is destroying their businesses. His real estate buddies tell him \u2014 and he agrees \u2014 that Amazon is killing shopping malls and brick-and-mortar retailers.\u201d  Amazon shares fell more than 7 percent following that Axios article but recovered some of those losses after a White House official told Reuters that the company faced no particular policy changes. But the administration is always looking at its options, the official added. The stock closed down 4.4 percent Wednesday.  Shares were down nearly 2 percent in early trading.  Should shareholders worry? The GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives told Bloomberg that this regulatory threat was unlikely to change Amazon\u2019s business model, but it was still \u201cthe last thing nervous tech investors wanted to see today.\u201d  Retailers, at least, already have some reason to be cheerful.  And Amazon has another target market for expansion: housekeeping.  First quarter profits are going to be big.  Corporate American will start reporting first-quarter results in less than two weeks, and earnings are expected to be big.  Analysts estimate that profits at companies in the S.&P. 500 grew 17.3 percent this quarter, according to FactSet. If the forecasts prove accurate that would be highest earnings growth rate since the first quarter of 2011.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Perhaps most surprising, is that analysts have grown more optimistic on corporate earnings as the quarter progressed. The earnings forecast for the index rose 5.4 percent from the start of the quarter to the end. Typically, analysts lower their expectations as the quarter progresses. On average, the profit estimates for the index fall 3.7 percent from the start of the quarter to the end.  But there are reasons for investors to temper their enthusiasm. Analysts have not been as optimistic about the abilities of companies to increase sales. Revenue is expected to have grown 7.3 percent in the first quarter, up from a 7 percent rate at the start of the quarter.  That suggests analysts are not raising estimates because of increased sales. So why are they? Taxes. And the impact tax reform will have on bottom lines should moderate in the coming quarters.  That may already be happening. BofA Merrill Lynch\u2019s earnings revision ratio for the S.&P. 500 fell in March for the first time in three months. Of course, the pullback comes after the ratio hits the highest level on record in February, but it does suggest that earnings lift from tax reform has begun to wane.  Photo  Are we witnessing the end of a tech boom?  Investors, always willing to believe in technology companies, spent the last three years piling into their shares with abandon. Now the intellectual underpinnings of that rally are being tested.  Exhibit A: Facebook, down 20 percent from its recent high.  Exhibit B: Nvidia, off 12 percent from its recent high.  Exhibit C: Tesla, not a tech stock but in the FANG+ index.  Concerns about Tesla\u2019s ability to fund itself can also be seen in the trading of its debt.  The WSJ\u2019s Charley Grant explains:  Tesla can\u2019t simply cut spending to solve its cash challenge if it hopes to ramp up production. The company has racked up about $10 billion in long-term debt and has $23 billion in total liabilities. To survive long term, Tesla needs to stop overpromising and to scale back its ambitions to goals it actually can achieve. Right now, though, it just needs more money.  Peter Eavis notes that the latest problems for tech giants have raised deeper doubts:  After the Uber incident in Arizona, those companies may take a more realistic look at what they have to spend to create a technology that is efficient and safe, and conclude that they have to pull out of the race or pare back. Users of social media and regulators may prevent social media companies from sharing so much of their data with advertisers, and that could restrain revenue growth. And if the passion for two or three big tech companies wanes, the cooling may spread.  Photo  Barclays pays $2 billion to settle mortgage securities suit.

And all this has to happen at a competitive cost. There\u2019s a lot that can trip you up.\u201d  Even as he introduced the Model 3 at an event last summer, Mr. Musk warned that the company would find itself in \u201cproduction hell\u201d \u2014 and as those words proved prescient, he has had to repeatedly dial back his forecasts for how many Tesla could churn out.  Mr. Musk once envisioned producing as many as 500,000 cars this year, and last summer he was hoping to be able to make 20,000 Model 3s a month by December. More recently, Tesla had aimed to produce at least 2,500 Model 3s per week by the end of the first quarter.  But that is more than it managed in the entire fourth quarter, and it has produced fewer than 10,000 in the first quarter, the company said Tuesday.  There have been signs of momentum, however. In the past seven days, Tesla said, it had produced 2,020 Model 3s, a rate it said it expected to sustain in the coming week.  In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Tesla said it expected its output to \u201cclimb rapidly\u201d through the second quarter and reach 5,000 per week in about three months. It added that it was \u201crapidly addressing production and supply-chain bottlenecks, including several short factory shutdowns to upgrade equipment.\u201d  Tesla has closely guarded the details of its manufacturing system, but Mr. Musk has described it as highly automated.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Ron Harbour, a partner and auto-manufacturing specialist at Oliver Wyman, a consulting firm, said that adding more automated equipment tends to create a more complex production environment. \u201cYou have more new equipment to launch, there\u2019s more programming, more maintenance,\u201d he said. \u201cMore automation doesn\u2019t necessarily make it more efficient.\u201d  The highest-volume plants he\u2019s seen, Mr. Harbour added, often have more assembly workers and fewer robots. \u201cIt\u2019s a little counterintuitive, but that\u2019s how it is,\u201d he said.

With a starting price of $35,000, the Model 3 is more affordable than Tesla\u2019s other models and a crucial part of its ambitions to become a mass-market automaker \u2014 as well as to stabilize its finances and turn a profit.  But Mr. Wakefield noted that working out bottlenecks and hitches in auto production often isn\u2019t as straightforward as it could appear. For example, modifying one part to make it fit better or stronger can require other parts to be modified, or can alter the car\u2019s driving characteristics.  \u201cIf you make a change to solve one problem, you can create five other problems,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople think you just find a problem and solve it, but it\u2019s not like that. There are literally millions of problems that come up and require thousands of engineers, working in teams, either at the car company or the suppliers, to deal with.\u201d  While Tesla scrambled to work out the kinks in making the Model 3 in the first quarter, deliveries of the Model S and Model X declined by 23 percent from the previous quarter \u2014 to 21,800 \u2014 even as the company reported \u201cthe most productive quarter in Tesla history.\u201d  Tesla said it had been hurt by a shortage of battery packs for its cars, made at the plant it calls the Gigafactory, near Reno, Nev.  Michelle Krebs, a senior analyst at Autotrader.com, said the decline in deliveries of the Model S and Model X might suggest that the allure of Tesla vehicles has somewhat faded. Electric cars make up fewer than 1 percent of all vehicles sold in the United States.  \u201cYou just wonder if there\u2019s enough growth in electric vehicles,\u201d she said. \u201cAt first everybody who wanted a Tesla and could afford a Tesla hopped on. But it\u2019s not the newest thing anymore.\u201d  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  In its statement on Tuesday, the company said that \u201cdemand remains strong\u201d for the Model S and Model X. But a sustained slump in sales of those vehicles could complicate Tesla\u2019s efforts to trim the losses it has been reporting every three months \u2014 including a net loss of $771 million in the fourth quarter.  Even aside from its production struggles with the Model 3, the company has been hit by a barrage of negative news in recent weeks.  Concern has grown over the safety of Autopilot, its driver-assistance system, after a fatal crash on March 23 that occurred while the system was engaged. It was at least the third fatal crash that has taken place while a driver was using Autopilot.  On Friday, Tesla said the driver had not heeded several visual and audible warnings to put his hands on the steering wheel before his Model X hit a concrete barrier. Neither the driver nor the car appeared to activate the brakes before impact.  Also last week, Moody\u2019s Investors Service downgraded Tesla\u2019s credit rating and said the company risked running short of cash by the end of the year.  The company said Tuesday that it saw no need to take special measures this year to raise cash.

Tesla lost $2.24 billion on sales of $3.3 billion, which the market shrugged off, at least until recently. That tells you how the stock market values the future of both companies and of E.V.s in particular.  It\u2019s not a belief that\u2019s universally held.

Ford\u2019s electric vehicles and hybrids, such as the Fusion Energi, may not match the Tesla Model X in style or speed, but Ford can knock out millions of fenders and hoods in its stamping operations with absolute certainty and to tight specifications.  Tesla is operating out of the former G.M./Toyota joint venture plant in Fremont, Calif., which produced more than 400,000 cars annually at its peak.

In recent days, though, Mr. Trump has targeted Amazon in tweets, asserting that the company has an unfair advantage. It\u2019s not clear what he could do to hurt Amazon\u2019s business, but the company\u2019s stock has plunged. Amazon\u2019s shares may well bounce back, but the criticism has added to investors\u2019 concerns about the outlook for large technology companies, whose soaring stock prices spearheaded the rally that took to the S.&P. 500 to its all-time high in January.  Too much blame can be placed on the White House, however.  Before investors began fretting about tech and trade, the underpinnings of the stock market\u2019s ascent were perhaps not as robust as they looked. Wall Street analysts expect earnings for the companies in the S.&P. 500 to increase 25 percent this year, according to data compiled by Standard & Poor\u2019s, an unusually large jump that was reflected in the stock market valuations. Much of that projected earnings increase is coming from tax cuts and some from expectations that companies\u2019 revenue would grow at a nice clip as global growth stayed strong.  The tax cuts are certainly going to improve profits. But rising interest rates around the world could weigh somewhat on companies\u2019 revenue growth. And if wages and other costs come in higher than expected \u2014 a significant possibility when the economy is suffering a shortage of some workers \u2014 profit margins could get squeezed. \u201cI don\u2019t think either of those are in the numbers,\u201d said Jim Paulsen, chief market strategist at the Leuthold Group.  \u2014 Peter Eavis  Photo  Not Funny  A little humor has not cleared the clouds over Tesla.  Shares in the company were once again sliding on Monday after the company\u2019s C.E.O., Elon Musk, joked on April 1 that Tesla had gone bankrupt, an apparent attempt to make light of concerns that the electric car maker is straining under its debt load.  Tesla\u2019s stock is now down 35 percent from its high of last year. A major reason for the slide is the company\u2019s struggles to meet production targets for its lower-priced Model 3 car. Delays, of course, raise questions about Tesla\u2019s ability to become an efficient mass producer of autos. The company needs to sell a significantly higher number of cars to generate the cash to finance its business and meet debt payments. Tesla is expected early this week to release its first-quarter production and delivery numbers.  Electrek, a publication that covers electric vehicles, reported late Monday morning that Mr. Musk had sent out an email to employees saying that the company was producing more than 2,000 Model 3s a week. Tesla\u2019s stock bounced after the report.  Tesla\u2019s technology is also facing intense scrutiny after one of its Model X cars crashed on March 23, killing the driver. Tesla said late Friday that its assisted driving system, called Autopilot, was engaged in the car before its collision with a concrete divider. As our colleague Neal E. Boudette wrote:  The accident renews questions about Autopilot, a signature feature of Tesla vehicles, and whether the company has gone far enough to ensure that it keeps drivers and passengers safe.  Tesla\u2019s website says one of Autopilot\u2019s safety features is \u201cAutomatic Emergency Braking.\u201d But a Tesla owner\u2019s manual warns riders that this feature \u201cis not designed to avoid a collision.\u201d Wired recently reported that systems like Autopilot are not necessarily designed to detect static obstacles. In the words of one expert:  Raj Rajkumar, who researches autonomous driving at Carnegie Mellon University, thinks those assumptions concern one of Tesla\u2019s key sensors. \u201cThe radars they use are apparently meant for detecting moving objects (as typically used in adaptive cruise control systems), and seem to be not very good in detecting stationary objects,\u201d he says.  Doubts about the fundamental capabilities of Tesla\u2019s Autopilot could crimp demand for its cars among a customer base that is often seeking the best technology.

In its first communication about the accident, the company said:  Out of respect for the privacy of our customer and his family, we do not plan to share any additional details until we conclude the investigation.  The investigation is not over. Yet Tesla went ahead and provided its update on Friday. The motive for doing so is not clear. The United States National Transportation Safety Board on Sunday said it was \u201cunhappy\u201d that Tesla had released information about the crash.  - Peter Eavis  Investors are running from FAANG stocks again.  Tech companies are again dragging down stocks on Wall Street.  The S.&P. 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite are off 3.1 percent and 3.5 percent Monday. The continued fall in the share prices of some of the biggest tech companies is weighing heavily on the indexes.  Amazon is down 5.4 percent, Netflix is off 5.9 percent, Facebook fell 3 percent, Google-parent Alphabet slipped 3.6 percent and Apple dropped 5.9 percent.  After leading the market higher for much of the past two years, tech stocks have hit some turbulence. Since March 16, Facebook, Alphabet, Netflix and Amazon are all down more than 12 percent, while Apple is down 7.3 percent.  Over that period the business models of those companies have come under increased scrutiny. News that Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm hired by President Trump\u2019s 2016 election campaign, gained access to private information on more than 50 million Facebook users has weighed not only on the shares of Facebook but on Alphabet as well. Amazon, meanwhile, has come under attack from President Trump.  In all, those companies have lost more than $300 billion in market value the past two weeks.  Photo  Trump continues to go after Amazon.  President Trump attacked the e-commerce again on Monday morning.  Monday\u2019s tweet is the latest over the past five days from Mr. Trump criticizing Amazon. Over that period, Mr. Trump has accused Amazon of not paying enough taxes, of putting thousands of local retailers out of business and of using the United States Postal Service as its \u201cDelivery Boy.\u201d  Mr. Trump\u2019s willingness to again single out Amazon and characterize it as a tax cheat and a job killer is a remarkable use of the presidential bully pulpit that could have serious implications for the company even without any formal moves by the federal government.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Amazon\u2019s shares are down 4 percent and are off nearly 11 percent since Axios reported on Wednesday about Mr. Trump\u2019s anger toward the company.  Context  \u2022 Amazon has said that the Postal Regulatory Commission, which oversees the service, has consistently found that its contracts with Amazon are profitable.  \u2022 The internet giant collects sales taxes on its own products in all 45 states that have one, but third-party vendors who sell products on the site often do not collect sales tax, a fact that rivals say is unfair. In addition, some municipalities complain that the company does not collect local taxes.  Critic\u2019s corner  DA Davidson analyst Tom Forte wrote in a note via Reuters:  \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s comments are consistent with industry sources we have spoken to in the shipping industry, who often label Amazon\u2019s deal with the USPS as a sweetheart deal. An argument, however, could be made that the USPS was losing billions before it expanded its service offerings for Amazon and would, still, likely lose billions if Amazon discontinued its use of the USPS tomorrow.\u201d  Intel isn\u2019t helping, either.  Shares of the chip maker are down 9 percent, their steepest decline in more than two years, after Bloomberg reported that Apple is planning to use its own chips in Mac computers beginning as early as 2020.  Citing anonymous sources, Bloomberg\u2019s Ian King and Matt Gurman report:  \u201cThe initiative, code named Kalamata, is still in the early developmental stages, but comes as part of a larger strategy to make all of Apple\u2019s devices \u2014 including Macs, iPhones, and iPads \u2014 work more similarly and seamlessly together.\u201d  Apple provides Intel with about 5 percent of its annual revenue.  Who says there are no rivalries in the hedge fund world?  Kenneth C. Griffin\u2019s Citadel has just hired Phil Villhauer, a former top trader at Steven A. Cohen\u2019s investment firm. Mr. Villhauer will become deputy head of global equities at Citadel, a newly created position. He will officially join the Chicago-based hedge fund in the middle of April and work out of Citadel\u2019s office in New York, a Citadel spokesman confirmed.  \u201cWe see this as a big hire for us,\u201d said Zia Ahmed, a Citadel spokesman.  Mr. Villhauer left Mr. Cohen\u2019s family office, Point72 Asset Management, in October after working for the billionaire investor for roughly 15 years. Mr. Villhauer had started at Mr. Cohen\u2019s former firm, SAC Capital Advisors, and most recently served as head of global trading at Point72.  The timing of Mr. Villhauer\u2019s departure came just months before Mr. Cohen was to begin managing money for outside investors.  In January, Mr. Cohen reconfigured Point72 as a hedge fund after establishing it as a family office in 2014 to manage $11 billion of his personal wealth. Point72 has said it has raised between $2 billion and $4 billion in outside money.

He was there when SAC turned into a powerhouse hedge fund, and he was there when the fund pleaded guilty to insider trading charges in 2013. The guilty plea required the firm to stop managing money for outside investors.  When Mr. Villhauer left Point72, Mr. Cohen, in a letter to employees, called the departure a \u201cretirement\u201d and said he was sad to see Mr. Villhauer go.  Now Mr. Villhauer will start a new chapter in his career at another well-known hedge fund firm.  ____________________________  Photo  Why Facebook\u2019s rivals have stayed mum  As Facebook lurches from crisis to crisis, other tech leaders like Marc Benioff and Tim Cook have criticized the company. But, for the most part, it\u2019s in their culture to stick together, Nick Wingfield writes.  Part of the silence, people in the industry say, comes from a desire to avoid the business equivalent of bad karma \u2014 knowing that they, too, may one day face the buzz saw of public censure.  Customers have less trouble speaking out, but those looking to punish major tech companies are finding that but boycotts are easier said than done.  At Facebook, the turmoil continued this weekend after a 2016 memo was leaked in which Andrew Bosworth, a vice president, wrote, \u201cMaybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools.

They regained some ground, but took another beating during the financial crisis. G.E. stock was climbing again in recent years, but last year began falling again.  \u201cWhether founders or executives, these individuals have a different risk appetite than other W-2 earning individuals,\u201d said Jeff Schnitz, head of wealth advisory for Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s private bank. \u201cThey have the opportunity to accept risk, and to create upside opportunities for themselves.\u201d  Some chief executives are taking this to new extremes. Elon Musk recently proposed a new compensation plan at Tesla. If approved, he will receive billions of dollars in compensation if he manages to double, triple and quadruple the value of the company. He will receive nothing if he does not.  Rick Smith, the chief executive of Axon, followed Mr. Musk\u2019s lead and proposed a nearly identical plan, albeit with smaller targets for the market valuation.  Mr. Musk and Mr. Smith are outliers. But even for less ambitions executives, the same principle holds.  \u201cYou want the C.E.O. fully aligned and driving a strong return on the investment,\u201d said Shirl Penney, the founder of Dynasty Financial Partners. \u201cThe investors want the senior leadership team as all in as possible.\u201d  Not everyone is willing to put all their eggs in one basket, however. And for those making a mere few hundred thousand dollars, or even a few million a year, the need to diversify can be real.  Photo  \u201cFor someone who is more of a middle-line manager who is saving toward retirement, we would typically advise not having more than 10 percent of your net worth in any one security,\u201d said Mr. Penney. \u201cYou try to advise someone to liquidate as much of their stock as possible and put it into a more diversified portfolio.\u201d  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  That can be easy for an executive at a publicly traded company. But it can be virtually impossible for executives or founders at private start-ups, many of whom have preferred stock or founders shares that are illiquid until a sale or initial public offering.  \u201cSelling or diversifying out of that stock has not only a financial ramification for it, but could have ramifications around who much control they have,\u201d said Mr. Penney.  And when start-up executives and founders do sell, the results can vary widely. Peter Thiel, an early investor in Facebook, has sold most all of his shares in the company, even as he remains a board member. It\u2019s a prudent bet \u2014 Facebook shares are hovering near their all-time high.  Photo  But sometimes, selling too early can be disastrous. Ronald Wayne, a co-founder of Apple, sold his stake in the company for $800 in 1976. That stock would today have been worth about $90 billion today, making him one of the richest men in the world.  Even if an executive or founder does want to sell stock, they need to be careful about not timing any sales to create the impression that they have lost faith in the company, or were trading on nonpublic information.  Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich recently drew scrutiny for selling about $39 million worth of shares after the company learned of a major security flaw in its chips, but before the news was made public.  Intel said the sale was unrelated to security issues and was part of a prearranged annual trading plan.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Financial advisers said such considerations were left largely to the executives themselves. \u201cWe\u2019re not really in the business of talking to C.E.O.s about the public perception of what they want to do,\u201d said Scott Senseney, head of sales, marketing and communications for Fidelity\u2019s stock plan services group.  Sophisticated financial planners have myriad ways to minimize risk, beyond simply diversifying. Executives with large stock holdings can hedge their positions, minimizing downside risk. Sometimes it\u2019s possible to sell upside call options.  And in so-called exchange funds, executives from various companies will pool their stock into a fund run by an asset manager, diversifying their exposure without having to sell shares and pay any immediate capital gains taxes.  Even then, however, undue complexity can backfire. In 2012, the founder of Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, Robert Stiller, was ousted as chairman of his own company after he sold five million shares, worth about $125 million. His motivation: he had taken out loans against his sizable stake in Green Mountain, now known as Keurig Green Mountain, but when the value of the shares fell, Mr. Stiller was caught in a margin call.  The most common pitfall for executives who are rewarded with stock, however, is simply ignorance. Too often, planners say, executives don\u2019t know what they have, or what options they are entitled to. Frequently, people become aware of their options only at the last minute, or even after the fact.  \u201cThe worst-case scenario is that those options expire in the money,\u201d said Mr. Senseney. \u201cWaiting too long can be devastating. There can be millions of dollars of impact.\u201d", "stock": "TSLA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-22", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/22/your-money/equity-stock-compensation.html"}, {"article": "Tesla shares dropped 8 percent on Tuesday and another 8 percent Wednesday, and though they regained ground Thursday, they have lost almost a quarter of their value in less than three weeks.  Reflecting questions about Tesla\u2019s ability to pay off its debt, its bonds have slumped as well. Those that will mature in 2025 traded at about 88 cents on the dollar on Thursday.  A Tesla representative declined to comment on the company\u2019s finances.  But the company\u2019s recent troubles extend beyond its balance sheet. Federal investigators are looking into a fiery crash that killed a Tesla driver last week in California, including the possibility that Autopilot was in use. (Autopilot was in use during a 2016 crash in Florida that killed a Tesla driver, but safety officials concluded that the crash did not result from a flaw in the system but found it lacked safeguards to prevent its misuse.)  And on Thursday, Tesla said it was recalling 123,000 Model S cars made before April 2016 to replace bolts that hold a power-steering motor in place. The bolts can become corroded and break, leaving drivers with only manual steering. The company said no crashes or injuries related to the issue had been reported.  Tesla\u2019s reversal of fortune is a jolt for both the company and its chief executive, who had built a reputation not only as a visionary but also as an achiever, masterminding an automotive brand, breaking ground on a battery plant that would be the world\u2019s biggest building, and launching rockets through his SpaceX venture.  For years, Tesla has ridden a wave of enthusiastic support from its customers and a certain set of investors, even though it generated barely any profit in the 15 years since its founding. Company events to present new models tend to have the feel of a religious revival, with hundreds or thousands of owners cheering wildly at each new pronouncement from Mr. Musk. Anticipation for the Model 3 prompted nearly 400,000 prospective customers to put down deposits of $1,000 each.  In November, before a screaming audience of several hundred guests, Mr. Musk unveiled a battery-powered semi truck and a two-seat roadster. He vowed to begin producing the truck by the end of 2019, even though the company does not have a factory to build it, and is still trying to work the kinks out of the Model 3 assembly process at its manufacturing plant in Fremont, Calif.

You add all that up and there\u2019s a real question about whether this company can deliver what it promises.\u201d  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  There\u2019s no doubt Tesla has achieved some breakthroughs that have left the established automakers scrambling to catch up. It has proved that there is a viable market for electric cars, and that they can command premium prices. It has pioneered methods of upgrading cars through software updates beamed over the air, the way iPhones can download new operating systems.  And it was Autopilot that set off a race to develop advanced driver-assistance systems that can guide cars under certain circumstances and actively prevent collisions \u2014 though Tesla\u2019s technology appears to have been surpassed by the self-driving systems from other companies, including G.M. and the Google spinoff Waymo.  Along the way, Mr. Musk has also courted controversy, including his move in 2016 for Tesla to take over SolarCity, a maker of home solar panels run by his cousin. A group of investors has filed a lawsuit contending that Mr. Musk had a conflict of interest because he was SolarCity\u2019s chairman, and this week a judge cleared the way for the case to go forward.  In January, Tesla gave Mr. Musk a new compensation plan tied entirely to the company\u2019s market value and other performance goals. If he hits all of the goals, he could be rewarded with stock worth more than $50 billion.  But the company has repeatedly failed to meet its own targets and deadlines, especially with the Model 3. Mr. Musk originally predicted that the Model 3 would arrive in 2017 and that the car would push the company\u2019s sales to 500,000 cars a year by 2018. He later lowered his prediction to 100,000 Model 3s in 2017. Backtracking again, he said last August that the company hoped to make 20,000 a month by December, and added that \u201cpeople should have zero concerns\u201d about Tesla\u2019s ability to increase its output of the Model 3.  But in the fourth quarter of last year, Tesla made only 2,425 Model 3s. In its most recent plan, it hopes to lift production to 2,500 Model 3s a week. The company is expected to release first-quarter production totals in early April.  The Model 3 is crucial. The company needs to ramp up its Model 3 business to generate revenue so that it can pay back investors and fund development of future vehicles including its electric truck.  Moody\u2019s concluded that Tesla probably needed to raise more than $2 billion from investors to be able to finance its operations, continue capital investment and pay debts and other financial obligations that will come due soon. According to Moody\u2019s, Tesla has $200 million in convertible bonds due later this year, and $900 million due in early 2019.  \u201cLiquidity is going to be very tight by the end of the year,\u201d Bruce Clark, a senior vice president at Moody\u2019s, said in an interview. \u201cThey need to re-establish credibility with the capital markets.\u201d", "stock": "TSLA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-29", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/29/business/tesla-elon-musk.html"}, {"article": "Technology stocks helped propel the nine-year bull market.

Verizon  Announced on CNBC as part of the telecom giant\u2019s fourth-quarter earnings rollout (emphasis added):  Verizon says employees, other than top management, will receive 50 shares of restricted stock, the price of which will be set on February 1. About 155,000 employees will be affected, Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam told CNBC\u2019s \u201cFast Money: Halftime Report\u201d on Tuesday.

JPMorgan  Here\u2019s what the bank, whose C.E.O. has been a vocal proponent of the tax overhaul, is doing:  \u2022 Raising wages by about 10 percent on average, to between $15 and $18 an hour, and improving benefits  \u2022 Expanding branches, at a time when other banks are scaling back  \u2022 Raising philanthropic giving by 40 percent, to $1.75 billion, over five years  \u2022 Increasing lending to small businesses by $4 billion  \u2022 Improving lending to low- to -moderate-income communities and to affordable housing projects  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  All that will cost an estimated $20 billion.  The comparison to other corporate titans  \u2022 Walmart is raising minimum hourly wage to $11, from $9; handing out bonuses; and improving parental benefits. The wage rise and bonuses will cost about $700 million.  \u2022 AT&T is handing out $1,000 bonuses to more than 200,000 employees and increasing capital spending by $1 billion.

In fact, that entire governing philosophy of pushing the envelope frightens me a little. I would hope it would bother you as well.  And:  Writ large, I intend to exercise our statutory authority to enforce the laws of this nation. I intend to execute the statutory mandate of the Bureau to protect consumers. But we will no longer go beyond that mandate. If Congress wants us to do more than is set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act, they can change the law. Until then, we will enforce the law as currently written.  The context: Mr. Mulvaney, a longtime critic of the C.F.P.B., has been working to rein in the bureau, a longtime target of Republican ire.  \u2014 Michael J. de la Merced  Photo  Tension at the top of Airbnb  The home rental company\u2019s C.E.O., Brian Chesky, isn\u2019t always seeing eye to eye with his C.F.O., Laurence Tosi, according to an article in The Information.  In one instance, Mr. Chesky thought about starting an airline as Airbnb weighed a move into the air travel business. Mr. Tosi insisted on a lower-key approach of partnering with an existing app, according to the news site.  The context: Mr. Tosi was brought in from Blackstone to help professionalize one of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest unicorn darlings, much as Ruth Porat joined Alphabet from Morgan Stanley. That was more than likely to foster a clash between Silicon Valley idealism and Wall Street pragmatism.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  More from Cory Weinberg of The Information:  Mr. Tosi, who moved with his wife and two young children to the Bay Area for the Airbnb job, has tried to fit in, swapping Wall Street suits for jeans and vests. But his arrival also was a shock to Airbnb\u2019s culture, with its emphasis on an idealistic brand. Mr. Tosi sent marching orders across the company in 2016 that it had to get profitable. Before Airbnb could go public, it would have to have a better handle on predicting its earnings. \u201cI believe we have built this path but can do more,\u201d he wrote to employees. Mr. Tosi initiated cost-cutting efforts, including cuts to customer service and food staff, that longtime Airbnb employees saw as hurting the culture. But Airbnb\u2019s cost per customer service \u201cticket\u201d fell by 30% to 40% between 2016 and mid-2017 last year, an Airbnb official said, thanks largely to Mr. Tosi.  Why it matters: Airbnb is expected to pursue an I.P.O. as soon as next year. Which vision for the company will win out?  \u2014 Michael J. de la Merced  Was there fraud at KPMG?  The charges against five former employees of KPMG and a former government accountant show the lengths an accounting firm will go to get a good report from the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.  The indictment is a bit odd, though, because the defendants are accused of defrauding both the S.E.C. and the accounting board. They used confidential information to help deal with potential problems in KPMG\u2019s audits. But did getting a sneak peek at how they would be evaluated constitute theft, or just a form of cheating?  Fraud is a type of larceny, and normally the perpetrator obtains something from the victim, who suffers a loss. But in this case, the scheme was to help KPMG clean up its act to get a better grade in pending reviews.  In the world of white-collar crime, most fraud prosecutions involve at least some form of tangible gain to the defendants, and not a better report card. Courts have also required prosecutors to show there was at least some harm to the victim from the misuse of their property.  One way around this issue would be to charge a breach of the honest services statute, but that\u2019s not in the indictment. Nor did the Justice Department charged them under a law prohibiting the theft of government records. The S.E.C. did not accuse the accountants of securities fraud, only that they engaged in unethical or improper professional conduct.  A statement by Steven Peikin, the co-director of the S.E.C.\u2019s enforcement division, said that the defendants were \u201cliterally stealing the exam.\u201d I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s quite accurate, however, as it was more like learning when the teacher would give a pop quiz.  Is that a fraud?  \u2014 Peter J. Henning  What will Twitter do now that Anthony Noto has flown the coop?

That\u2019s under a new compensation plan that Andrew reported first today. Critics, and there are many, may regard it as yet another publicity stunt by the electric car marker, which has struggled to meet production targets for its Model 3.  But Mr. Musk and the head of the Tesla board\u2019s compensation committee said the arrangement would benefit shareholders, since it\u2019s directly linked to company performance.  Here\u2019s what Mr. Musk told Andrew:  \u201cIf all that happens over the next 10 years is that Tesla\u2019s value grows by 80 or 90 percent, then my amount of compensation would be zero,\u201d he said. (His calculations were based on the stock price at the beginning of this year, when the company was worth about $50 billion.)  Trivia: California law requires that Tesla pay Mr. Musk minimum wage, even though he doesn\u2019t want a salary. So it cuts him a check for a little over $37,000 each year, which he never cashes.

Putting the Model 3 into mass production is a critical task for Tesla. The company has taken $1,000 deposits from about 400,000 customers interested in buying the car. If it can begin producing the car rapidly, its sales and revenue will soar and it could vault into profitability.  Just two years ago, Mr. Musk hoped to make 500,000 by 2018, and the ambitious forecast helped push Tesla\u2019s market value above that of General Motors and Ford Motor for a period in 2017.  In July, as Model 3 production was about to begin, Mr. Musk ratcheted back expectations, resetting his target to 20,000 vehicles a month by December. But difficulties producing battery packs at Tesla\u2019s Nevada plant, called the Gigafactory, and other glitches in the car\u2019s assembly process combined to slow output to a crawl.  Tesla built just 260 by the end of September. In January, it said it had made only 2,425 in the final quarter of 2017, and set a goal of increasing output to 5,000 a month by the end of the first quarter.  Mr. Musk said Tesla had developed a new automated production line that would be installed in the Gigafactory in March, easing hitches in supplying batteries to its assembly plant in Fremont, Calif., which was once operated jointly by Toyota Motor and General Motors.

When investors don\u2019t put any more money into the company, then you will know it\u2019s a problem.\u201d  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  On a positive note, Tesla reported it used up only $277 million in cash in the fourth quarter. That was down from $1.4 billion in the third quarter. On a full-year basis, however, the company used nearly $3.5 billion in cash, more than twice the amount from 2016.  The company\u2019s loss in the quarter amounted to $3.04 per share on an adjusted basis, slightly less than analysts had forecast, and $4.01 unadjusted.  Tesla has lost money in eight of the last nine quarters. Mr. Musk said he was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d that it would begin to generate net income in 2018, as Model 3 production and deliveries rose.  The company\u2019s shares were little changed in extended trading after the earnings report. They had risen 3.3 percent during the regular session.  Even if Model 3 output rises, Tesla will have to spend heavily on two future vehicles \u2014 a battery-powered semi truck and another car, the Model Y.  While working on the Model 3, Mr. Musk has continued to seek new barriers to break in other areas.  On Tuesday, his other company, SpaceX, successfully launched a heavy rocket into space. It was the first time a rocket that powerful had been launched by a private company. The Falcon Heavy is carrying a cherry-red Tesla Roadster. The rocket and the car are intended to go into an orbit around the sun, where they could remain for hundreds of millions of years.  \u201cIf we can send a Roadster to the asteroid belt,\u201d Mr. Musk said Wednesday, \u201cI think we can solve Model 3 production.\u201d", "stock": "TSLA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-07", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/07/business/tesla-musk.html"}, {"article": "\u201cOne of our priorities will be to equip our 189 dealerships with 800-volt DC fast chargers,\u201d said Klaus Zellmer, president and chief executive of Porsche Cars North America. \u201cWe have just installed six at our Porsche Experience centers in Atlanta and will roll them out at our experience center in Los Angeles, too.\u201d  As part of its settlement with the California Air Resources Board and the United States Environmental Protection Agency over its diesel emission test cheating, Volkswagen, Porsche\u2019s parent company, is also building a network of 2,800 DC fast chargers by June 2019.  Photo  The Cross Turismo introduced on Tuesday is part of the other half of this two-pronged approach. Although it is officially a concept vehicle, it is expected to be an accurate preview of what buyers will see from Porsche after the Mission E vehicles go into production next year. While no pricing has been announced, the sedan version could run close to the existing Panamera, which begins at $85,000, compared with the $74,500 base price of a Tesla Model S 75D.  The Mission E vehicles are hardly alone in jockeying for position in the premium electric market. Last week, Jaguar unveiled the production version of its fully electric I-Pace crossover, which is scheduled to glide into showrooms in the second half of 2018. The Jaguar I-Pace, the carmaker\u2019s first electric vehicle, will start at $69,500 in the United States; a Tesla Model X starts at $79,500.  Audi has announced it will ship its e-tron quattro to European showrooms this fall and to the United States in early 2019. And Volvo plans an all-electric version of its XC40 crossover in 2019.  Porsche, Jaguar, Audi and other long-established carmakers have watched as Tesla has sprinted ahead, but Tesla will soon lose one crucial benefit that the later arrivals may be able to use to close the gap: tax benefits. At some point this year, Tesla will produce its 200,000th car. (General Motors, which makes the Chevrolet Bolt EV and Volt electric vehicles, will most likely reach that mark in 2018, too.) At that milestone, federal tax credits will begin to phase out.  It\u2019s not clear whether the new upscale choices will hurt Tesla or simply expand the segment. Dave Guilford, a managing editor for Crain\u2019s Automotive News, suggested that \u201cit\u2019s probably a little bit of both.\u201d  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  \u201cYou could see when Porsche unveiled the Mission E it was aiming right at Tesla,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful car. New entries in the premium segment give it credibility.\u201d  The wagonlike all-wheel-drive Cross Turismo could be a compelling alternative to the Model X. Its 440-kilowatt system uses two permanent synchronous electric motors and a floor-mounted lithium-ion battery pack that Porsche claims will propel the Cross Turismo to 60 miles per hour in 3.5 seconds. It will also employ an air suspension that can add nearly two inches of ground clearance and rear-wheel steering that will help it in the corners. At 15 feet long, the Cross Turismo concept is about four inches shorter than the company\u2019s Macan crossover and 18 inches shorter than a Tesla Model X.  The concept\u2019s interior features a free-standing instrument cluster screen with three circular display graphics. A camera with eye-tracking ability recognizes which graphic the driver is looking at and moves it forward while reducing the size of the others. Porsche executives suggested that the technology was being considered for the production car.

Tesla has had trouble meeting its production goals for the Model 3, the most affordable entry in its lineup. There have also been quality issues; Consumer Reports ranked the Model X among the 10 least-reliable vehicles in its survey, and there have been well-documented fit and finish problems.  That has provided an opening not just for the luxury carmakers, but for the rest of the industry to join General Motors and Nissan, which makes the Leaf electric vehicle, in challenging Tesla\u2019s Model 3. Hyundai, for example, has confirmed plans for a fully electric Kona crossover, and Buick is rumored to be gaining a small crossover based on the Chevy Bolt platform.

It\u2019s not an autonomous system. It\u2019s not a hands-free system. But that\u2019s how people are using it, and it works fine, until it suddenly doesn\u2019t.\u201d  On Saturday, Tesla declined to comment on the California crash or to make Mr. Musk or another executive available for an interview. In its blog post on Friday about the crash, the company acknowledged that Autopilot \u201cdoes not prevent all accidents,\u201d but said the system \u201cmakes them much less likely to occur\u201d and \u201cunequivocally makes the world safer.\u201d  For the company, the significance of the crash goes beyond Autopilot. Tesla is already reeling from a barrage of negative news. The value of its stock and bonds has plunged amid increasing concerns about how much cash it is using up and the repeated delays in the production of the Model 3, a battery-powered compact car that Mr. Musk is counting on to generate much-needed revenue.  It is also facing an investor lawsuit related to Tesla\u2019s acquisition of SolarCity, a solar-panel maker where Mr. Musk was serving as chairman. Meanwhile, competition is mounting from other luxury car makers that have developed their own electric cars, while Waymo, the Google spinoff, General Motors and others seem to have passed Tesla in self-driving technology.  \u201cThere\u2019s a lot going on that undermines Elon\u2019s credibility right now,\u201d said Karl Brauer, a senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book.

It can steer, brake and accelerate automatically with little input from the driver. Tesla readily points out that Autopilot \u2014 despite the implications in its name \u2014 is only a driver-assistance system and is not intended to pilot cars on its own.  Drivers are given warnings on the dashboard and in the owner\u2019s manual to remain engaged and alert while using it. Tesla originally described it as a \u201cbeta\u201d version, a term that usually refers to software still in the developmental stage.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  At the time of the Florida crash, it was possible to engage Autopilot and cruise on highways for several minutes without the driver holding the steering wheel. In that crash, the Autopilot\u2019s camera, then the primary sensor in the system, failed to recognize a white truck as it was crossing a rural highway. Tesla said the camera was confused because the truck appeared against a bright sky.  Software modifications introduced that fall included more frequent warnings to drivers to keep their hands on the steering wheel. After three warnings, the new software prevents Autopilot from operating until the driver stops, turns off the car and restarts.  The new version also made radar the primary sensor, and Mr. Musk said the new radar would have been able to see the truck in the Florida crash despite the bright sky.  Autopilot does not use lidar \u2014 a kind of radar based on lasers \u2014 that Waymo and others have maintained are crucial for fully autonomous vehicles. Mr. Musk has said he believes lidar is not necessary for Autopilot to be safe.  At least three people have now died while driving with Autopilot engaged. In January 2017, a Chinese owner was at the wheel of a Model S when the car crashed into a road sweeper on a highway.  The National Transportation Safety Board is now investigating the March 23 crash that killed Mr. Huang. Its investigation of the 2016 Florida accident concluded that Autopilot \u201cplayed a major role,\u201d and said that it lacked safeguards to prevent misuse by drivers.  An earlier investigation, by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration, said that the company\u2019s Autopilot-enabled vehicles did not need to be recalled. That inquiry, however, focused only on the question of whether any flaws in the system had led to the crash; it found no such flaws.", "stock": "TSLA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-31", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/31/business/tesla-crash-autopilot-musk.html"}, {"article": "Despite this wave of negative publicity, it seems clear that Tesla will rise or fall based on the performance, safety, design and value of its cars. If it gets those things right, all the other issues will sort themselves out. Tesla has already defied skeptics and attracted legions of die-hard fans by surmounting seemingly impossible odds to build all-electric cars that have drawn lavish praise from automotive critics.  That includes the Model 3, which Popular Mechanics named its 2018 Car of the Year. (It was a finalist for Motor Trend\u2019s similar award. That it lost out to the Alfa Romeo Giulia has drawn howls of online protest.)  When my Model 3 test vehicle pulled up to the curb on Eighth Avenue, it didn\u2019t quite stop pedestrian traffic the way opening the gull-wing doors on the Model X had, but I could see why the automotive press is so excited. The interior features a single slab of wood sweeping around the cockpit interrupted only by a touch-screen interface that houses nearly all the controls, many of them voice activated.  With its Zen minimalism, it doesn\u2019t look or feel like any other car I\u2019ve been in. The synthetic-leather seats are comfortable, and there\u2019s ample room for someone my size (6-foot-3). This all comes at a cost: $57,500 for this luxurious long-range version, far from the $35,000 base price that has excited many potential Tesla buyers.  The Model 3 may not have the rocketlike acceleration of the X, but I found it nimble and responsive. I easily accelerated from a full stop into traffic flowing at highway speed, usually a nerve-racking maneuver in a conventional car. Driving the Model 3 was such a pleasure I was reluctant to cede any control to Autopilot.  For someone with decades of experience driving a conventional car, my first taste of semiautonomous driving last fall had come as a shock. The sensation of a vehicle moving on its own was so bizarre that I instinctively gripped the steering wheel, which immediately transferred control back to me.  This time I was more relaxed, willing to see how the car would behave. I gave the voice-activated navigation system a destination (Garden State Plaza, a New Jersey shopping mall about 20 miles away), and the car accelerated, braked, stayed in the center of the lane and maintained a comfortable three-car distance ahead of me, all without my intervention. At the mall, it detected an empty parking place, and flawlessly backed into it.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  One of its most impressive features is the ability for the driver to change lanes simply by pressing the turn-signal lever. The Tesla scans for traffic in the adjacent lane, waits for an opening and then glides into place, eliminating the danger of a blind spot. (Over the years I\u2019ve experienced several close calls involving lane changes and blind spots.)

Although I\u2019d been briefed on its limitations, so successful was Autopilot that I was tempted to let down my guard by not bothering to look in the rearview mirror. That would have been a mistake.  For all its vision capabilities (including in darkness), Autopilot became confused when lanes weren\u2019t clearly marked or split in two or at exit ramps. You can\u2019t simply program the destination and let the car find its way. It\u2019s reassuringly cautious about changing lanes, but in heavy traffic, I would have missed an exit while waiting for it to find a suitable opening, and had to assert manual control.  While heading south on the New Jersey Turnpike, I could see in the rearview mirror a BMW bearing down at high speed. I pushed the turn signal for a lane change, and despite its ultrasonic sensors, the Tesla seemed oblivious to the onrushing car. It started to move into its lane; the driver laid on his horn, and I had to grab control to avoid an accident.  Blog posts indicate that other drivers have experienced the same issue.  The Tesla owner\u2019s manual describes this situation as one that the system can\u2019t yet manage. Tesla said it expected future upgrades to solve the problem, but for now, drivers need to be as attentive to the rearview mirror as with any other car.  Tesla had no comment for this column.  At this juncture, Autopilot is a misnomer, as many others have observed. \u201cThis is not self-driving technology,\u201d said Bryan Reimer, a research scientist and expert on autonomous vehicle technology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cIt\u2019s a collaborative system that leaves responsibility for safety in the drivers\u2019 hands and isn\u2019t intended to let them sit in the back seat or pursue other activities while driving.\u201d Even though some companies have said they plan driverless ride services in as little as two years, Mr. Reimer said full automation was likely to be many years or even decades in the future.  Self-driving automation systems are ranked from zero (no automation) to 5 (full automation). Tesla\u2019s Autopilot is Level 2. It requires drivers to keep at least one hand on the wheel. The car issues a prompt if it doesn\u2019t detect a hand on the wheel, and Autopilot shuts down if there\u2019s no response. In the Mountain View accident, Tesla has said, the driver \u201creceived several visual and one audible hands-on warning,\u201d but \u201cthe driver\u2019s hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds prior to the collision.\u201d  Given that this was my first extended drive using Autopilot, I was hypervigilant, maybe even more so than in a conventional car. I\u2019m told that wears off in time, as using Autopilot becomes second nature. The risk is that complacency contributes to driver inattention. Mr. Reimer and other experts are conducting research into the issue.  \u201cAs technology supplants human performance,\u201d Mr. Reimer said, \u201cthe bigger question is how safe is safe enough. If lane-changing technology is 50 percent more effective than humans, is that good enough? That\u2019s the big question no one wants to answer.\u201d  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  At the same time, he said, he worries that \u201cintense media coverage of accidents like Mountain View will scare people off.\u201d He said it was too soon to draw any conclusions from that fatality, but noted that Tesla\u2019s excellent safety record over the many millions of miles its cars have now traveled suggested that using Autopilot \u201ccan\u2019t be substantially more risky than conventional controls.\u201d (There were more than 40,000 traffic fatalities in the United States last year.)  After investigating a fatal 2016 crash involving a Tesla S and a tractor-trailer in Florida, the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration found no flaws in the Autopilot system. The National Transportation Safety Board concluded that Autopilot had performed as intended, but that the driver had become overly reliant on the technology.  After my drive in the Model 3, my sense is that even with its flaws, Tesla\u2019s Autopilot is a vast improvement over conventional controls, and enhances (rather than supplants) the driving experience. I\u2019m tempted to join the Model 3 waiting list, which numbers over 400,000 customers.  Investors, too, seem to have reassessed Tesla\u2019s recent bad news. This past week, Tesla said it had succeeded in ramping up production of the Model 3, though it still fell short of targets, and had adequate capital for the rest of the year.

Model S electric vehicle on display in October 2016. On Thursday, the auto maker said it was recalling about 123,000 Model S sedans over a potential bolt issue. Photo: Vadim Ghirda/Associated Press  Tesla Inc. TSLA 2.13% is voluntarily recalling about 123,000 Model S sedans globally after discovering that certain corroding bolts in cold weather climates could lead to a power-steering failure.  The Silicon Valley auto maker on Thursday said the recall, believed to be the company\u2019s largest ever, applies to Model S sedans built before April 2016. Tesla said the issue is known to have involved less than 0.02% of the potentially affected vehicles in the U.S.  Tesla has sold about 280,000 total vehicles through the end of last year.  \u201cThere have been no injuries or accidents due to this component, despite accumulating more than a billion miles of driving,\u201d according to an email being sent to customers by Tesla. The recall to retrofit the power steering component adds to the string of challenges Chief Executive Elon Musk is dealing with as he tries to boost production of the Tesla\u2019s mass-market Model 3 sedan and conserve the company\u2019s cash supply. Moody\u2019s Investors Service this week downgraded Tesla\u2019s credit rating, concerned that the company won\u2019t meet its first-quarter goal of making 2,500 Model 3s a week. The milestone is important because further delays could crimp Tesla\u2019s cash and threaten to derail Tesla\u2019s bid to build electric cars for the masses. The downgrade, along with news this week that federal investigators were probing a fatal crash of a Tesla car, have led to a heavy selloff of the company\u2019s shares and bonds, making it potentially more difficult to raise capital. On Thursday, Tesla\u2019s stock rose 3.2%, to $266.13, during the regular trading session, and fell slightly in after-hours trading following the recall news. It has been a rough month for the stock, which has fallen about 20% over the 30-day period. Tesla is expected to reveal first-quarter production results early next week. The recall on Thursday only involves the Model S. Tesla said its service center in Montreal began noticing the issue in Model S sedans and attributed the corrosion to the calcium or magnesium salts used to treat roadways during the winter months. If the bolts fail, the car can still be steered but requires additional force. \u201cThis primarily makes the car harder to drive at low speeds and for parallel parking, but does not materially affect control at high speed, where only small steering wheel force is needed,\u201d the company said. The cost of the recall is expected to be minimal, Tesla said, with the supplier paying for the new part.

TSLA 2.13% said it updated the pay package for Chief Executive Elon Musk with a plan that again ties his compensation entirely to key performance benchmarks\u2014albeit this time much larger ones, including an ultimate goal to hit $650 billion in market value.  The pay plan, which shareholders must still approve, is designed to keep Mr. Musk as Tesla\u2019s top leader for years to come\u2014although allows for the prospect that he might evolve away from the day-to-day role of CEO into one of executive chairman and chief product officer.  The plan, which is modeled on an earlier program set for Mr. Musk in 2012, entails a 10-year grant of stock options that would vest in 12 tranches. Each would vest only if a set of two milestones are achieved, one based on market value, the other on a measure of revenue or profit. For each tranche achieved, Mr. Musk would receive shares equal to 1% of the company\u2019s total shares outstanding as of Jan. 21, 2018.  For example, the first tranche would vest if Tesla hits $100 billion in market value and $20 billion in revenue or $1.5 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, after adjusting for stock compensation. For all 12 tranches to vest, Tesla\u2019s market value would have to reach $650 billion.  Tesla, which reported revenue of $7 billion for 2016, had a market value of about $58.8 billion as of Monday\u2019s close. Mr. Musk owns about 20% of the company, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.  \u201cThis ensures that Elon will continue to lead Tesla\u2019s management over the long-term while also providing the flexibility to bring in another CEO who would report to Elon at some point in the future,\u201d Tesla said in a statement about the plan released around 12:30 a.m. on Tuesday in California. \u201cAlthough there is no current intention for this to happen, it provides the flexibility as Tesla continues to grow to potentially allow Elon to focus more of his attention on the kinds of key product and strategic matters that most impact Tesla\u2019s long-term growth and profitability.\u201d  Tesla said that if none of the tranches are achieved, Mr. Musk wouldn\u2019t receive any compensation. That would put him in similar territory to some other prominent Silicon Valley leaders who own enormously valuable stakes in their companies but receive little or no salary.  Mr. Musk\u2019s previous compensation program, granted in 2012, targeted a market value of $43.2 billion along with meeting certain milestones by 2022. It required him to remain as CEO.  Since Tesla overtook Ford Motor Co.\u2019s market value last year, and flirted with that of General Motors Co. , the Silicon Valley auto maker\u2019s valuation has been a continual point of conversation. Critics question why investors are betting so much on a company that has yet to turn an annual profit and that has delivered a fraction of the sales of much larger competitors.  Fans say they are betting on Mr. Musk\u2019s vision for personal transportation that includes electric cars that drive themselves and are powered off the company\u2019s solar panels and charged from its storage batteries.  Investor enthusiasm fueled Tesla\u2019s growth last year, even as Mr. Musk struggled to ramp up production of the Model 3 sedan, which is testing his ability to evolve the company into a more mainstream auto maker from one of a luxury niche player.  Mr. Musk has previously outlined a way for the company to reach a market cap of $700 billion, something he reiterated last year.  \u201cI could be completely delusional but I think I see a clear path to that outcome,\u201d he told analysts in May.  Mr. Musk, who also heads other companies including Space Exploration Technologies Corp., or SpaceX, has hinted that he might want to change his role at Tesla.  In May, an analyst asked Mr. Musk if he still intended to step away from Tesla after bringing out the Model 3, as he had previously suggested.  \u201cI intend to be actively involved with Tesla for the rest of my life,\u201d Mr. Musk said. \u201cHopefully, stopping before I get too old\u2014or too crazy, I don\u2019t know. But that doesn\u2019t mean I should be CEO forever.\u201d He suggested a role contributing in \u201cproduct design and technology.\u201d  Write to Tim Higgins at Tim.Higgins@WSJ.com", "stock": "TSLA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-01-23", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-gives-musk-new-long-term-pay-deal-tied-to-big-targets-1516704840?mod=searchresults&amp;page=1&amp;pos=2"}, {"article": "Tesla Inc. is expected to release fourth-quarter financial results after the market closes Wednesday. Here\u2019s what you need to know:  EARNINGS FORECAST: Tesla is expected to post an adjusted loss of $3.15 a share, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet, compared with an adjusted 69 cent-a-share loss a year earlier. Adjusted results exclude stock-based and acquisition costs, and other items.  REVENUE FORECAST: Revenue is expected to rise to $3.29 billion, according to FactSet, from $2.28 billion a year earlier. Tesla has said deliveries of the Model X sport-utility vehicle, Model S sedan and new Model 3 sedan totaled 29,870 during the quarter, up 35% from a year ago. The company delivered 1,550 units of the Model 3, which began production in July.  WHAT TO WATCH:  PRODUCTION HELL: \u201cWe believe an update on the Model 3 production ramp will be the first question on many investors\u2019 minds,\u201d James Albertine, an analyst for Consumer Edge Research, said in a note to investors. Investors have watched Tesla fall months behind in its production goals after running into bottlenecks at its Fremont, Calif., assembly factory and Nevada battery plant. Chief Executive Elon Musk once had predicted reaching a rate of production of 5,000 Model 3 vehicles a week by the end of the last year\u2019s fourth quarter\u2014a prediction that had already fallen from 20,000 in December and, at one point, as many as 200,000 in the second half of 2017. Tesla ended up making 2,425 Model 3s in the fourth quarter, the company reported in January as it pushed back the goal of reaching 5,000 a week until the end of June.  CASH BURN: Mr. Musk has long said the ramp-up of the Model 3, a sedan with a $35,000 price tag aimed at making Tesla vehicles more accessible, would generate the cash needed to fund the company\u2019s expansion. The sedan\u2019s delays put that vision at risk. Tesla began the final three months of 2017 with $3.5 billion on hand and planned to spend $1 billion during the period on capital expenditures. Earlier this month, the company raised about $550 million from bonds. Tesla executives have said they need a minimum of $1 billion each quarter for working capital. Colin Langan, an analyst for UBS, estimates Tesla can generate about $1 billion in working capital once it produces 5,000 Model 3s a week. Even so, he and others expect Tesla will need to raise additional money.  WHAT\u2019S NEXT: In recent months, Mr. Musk has generated attention talking about plans for new vehicles\u2014a two-door Roadster sports car, commercial truck and compact SUV\u2014as well as new factories in Europe and China. All would cost billions of dollars. In November, he and Chief Financial Officer Deepak Ahuja hinted at internal discussions about whether Tesla needed to back away from some of its growth plans to rein in spending. Investors are anxious for clarity about the evolving strategy. Excitement over the new products may already be helping Mr. Musk\u2019s cash situation. Deposits in the fourth quarter for the new commercial truck and the sports car, as well as a sell-down in Model S and Model X inventory, may have boosted Tesla\u2019s working capital by $700 million, according to Mr. Langan\u2019s estimates.

Photo: SpaceX/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images  Tesla is literally flying high after Elon Musk\u2019s successful rocket launch, which blasted a vehicle into outer space. Fourth-quarter earnings out Wednesday, however, still point to a number of challenges back here on Earth.  Tesla reported fourth-quarter revenue of $3.3 billion and an adjusted loss of $3.04 a share. That just beat the analyst consensus loss of $3.11. But a year ago, the consensus for the fourth quarter was a loss of 17 cents a share.  There were bright spots besides the earnings. Tesla burned just $277 million in free cash, a significant improvement from recent quarters. And the company managed to avoid lowering its Model 3 production forecast for a third time in three months. The cash burn appeared lower because Tesla included customer deposits for its planned new truck and roadster in its operating cash flow. That is deceiving because these deposits aren\u2019t drawn from current operations.  Meanwhile, an alarming trend of negative operating leverage has yet to reverse itself\u2014the more cars it sells the worse its margins become. Automotive gross margin fell to 13.8%, down more than 8 percentage points from a year earlier. That trend isn\u2019t likely to meaningfully reverse any time soon. Tesla forecasts about 100,000 deliveries of its older Model S and X vehicles this year, which offer better profits than the Model 3. That won\u2019t offer much, if any, growth from the 2017 tally of 101,000 cars.  The Model 3 is supposed to carry prices up to 65% below Tesla\u2019s average selling price on older products; there will have to be substantial cost-cutting and improvements in production efficiency to even hold margins constant. Meanwhile, new industry competition coming this year won\u2019t improve pricing power.  Granted, investor faith in Mr. Musk is as strong as ever, and Tesla still enjoys open access to capital markets. Fears of a crash in the stock price aren\u2019t likely to materialize anytime soon.  However, Tesla\u2019s chances of becoming a sustainable business that doesn\u2019t need constant capital markets access to survive seems less likely than a sports car in orbit.

Emergency personnel work at the scene where a Tesla vehicle crashed in Mountain View, Calif. on March 23. Tesla on Wednesday said the driver of the car was to blame, while his family said they were exploring legal options following the fatal accident. Photo: /Associated Press  Tesla Inc. TSLA 2.13% defended its semiautonomous Autopilot system in the wake of a fatal crash last month, blaming the incident on the driver after his family hired a lawyer to explore legal options.  Walter Huang died on March 23 after the Model X sport-utility vehicle he was driving southbound on Highway 101 near Mountain View, Calif., collided with a barrier and was struck by two other vehicles. The auto maker a week later said that the SUV\u2019s Autopilot was activated in the moments leading up to the crash and that the driver\u2019s hands weren\u2019t detected on the wheel for six seconds before the crash.  On Wednesday, Tesla more explicitly assigned blame to the driver. \u201cThe crash happened on a clear day with several hundred feet of visibility ahead, which means that the only way for this accident to have occurred is if Mr. Huang wasn\u2019t paying attention to the road, despite the car providing multiple warnings to do so,\u201d a Tesla spokesman said in a statement.  Earlier on Wednesday, San Francisco-based Minami Tamaki LLP announced in a statement that the family had retained its services and plans to file a wrongful-death lawsuit. The family appeared on local television on Tuesday night defending Mr. Huang\u2019s driving.  \u201cThe firm believes Tesla\u2019s Autopilot feature is defective and likely caused Huang\u2019s death, despite Tesla\u2019s apparent attempt to blame the victim of this terrible tragedy,\u201d the law firm said in a statement.  Investigators for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board are probing the crash. On April 1, the NTSB said it was unhappy with Tesla for releasing detailed information about the crash.  NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt and Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk had a recent discussion that appeared to defuse the tension. \u201cChairman Sumwalt had what he described as a very constructive conversation with Mr. Musk over the weekend,\u201d a spokesman for the NTSB said. \u201cThey discussed the investigation of the March 23 Tesla crash, NTSB investigative processes, and Tesla\u2019s work to address the safety recommendations that were issued last year as a result of the May 2016 Tesla crash in Williston, Florida.\u201d \u200bThe latter was a reference to a fatal crash involving Autopilot for which the NTSB determined Tesla shared blame.  Tesla declined to comment on the discussion.  The NTSB declined to comment\u200b on Tesla\u2019s defense of its technology in the most recent fatal crash, while NHTSA had no immediate comment.\u200bSeparately, the NTSB spokesman said the agency was investigating a battery fire linked to a Tesla Model X SUV that crashed into a garage in Lake Forest, Calif., in August 2017. The NTSB is primarily interested in the battery fire in that incident, the spokesman said. Tesla declined to comment on the battery-fire probe.  Tesla\u2019s Wednesday statement intensified its defense of semiautonomous technology amid greater scrutiny of whether humans can remain alert while using these systems. Auto makers are rolling out partially automated systems that pass control back and forth between vehicle and driver, some with technology designed to keep the driver alert, such as eye-tracking technology. Others, like Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Waymo, believe there should be no need for a human to take control in driving situations.  Autopilot, which is a collection of \u201cdriver assistance features,\u201d isn\u2019t a self-driving system. Tesla tells users in its owner\u2019s manual and in-vehicle display warnings that users need to remain alert and maintain control of the vehicle.  \u201cWe empathize with Mr. Huang\u2019s family, who are understandably facing loss and grief, but the false impression that Autopilot is unsafe will cause harm to others on the road,\u201d Tesla said Wednesday. \u201cThe reason that other families are not on TV is because their loved ones are still alive.\u201d  Tesla had said earlier that the driver took no action despite having five seconds and about 500 feet of unobstructed view of the concrete highway divider.  The 2016 fatal crash in Florida put Tesla\u2019s technology into the spotlight. The NTSB said Tesla shared partial blame for the crash, noting Autopilot allowed the driver to go long periods without his hands on the wheel and ignore the company\u2019s warnings. NHTSA, however, said the system wasn\u2019t defective and that Tesla vehicles\u2019 crash rate dropped by almost 40% after the auto-steer feature was installed. The vehicle in the 2016 accident was equipped with the auto-steer feature.  After the NTSB findings in the 2016 crash, Tesla said it would continue to be clear with current and potential customers that Autopilot doesn\u2019t render vehicles fully self-driving and that motorists must always remain attentive.

Residential solar had been on a tear, averaging 49% annual growth between 2010 and 2016, but the number of megawatts added last year dropped by 16% compared with the year before, according to new data from GTM Research, a firm that tracks renewable energy. It was the first annual decline since at least 2000, which is as far back as GTM tracks figures.  Industry executives and energy experts said the slowdown was driven by a sharp retreat by national solar installers, including Tesla\u2019s SolarCity and Vivint Solar Inc. VSLR -2.44% Those big outfits had deployed large sales forces to pitch homeowners on the benefits of rooftop solar, and heavily marketed deals to lease panels that required little to no money down.  The race to build a dominant national solar brand led companies to burn through cash. Unable to maintain that pace, companies scaled back and focused on profits over growth, or in some cases, got out of the rooftop solar business altogether.  SolarCity, purchased by Tesla in 2016, posted the largest declines. Once the clear-cut leader among solar installers, with one-third of the national market two years ago, it ended door-to-door sales last year and cut customer-acquisition spending. Its sales, as measured by megawatts deployed, fell by 38% in 2017, according to company figures, which include both residential and commercial installations.  Tesla said it was moving away from no-money-down leases and toward sales. It appears to have been passed by rival Sunrun Inc. RUN 0.35% in recent months as the top solar installer in the country, according to GTM.  \u201cWe expect growth to resume later this year,\u201d Tesla said last month.  Other companies also retreated from heavily marketing their home solar businesses, including NRG Energy Inc., NRG 0.37% which shut its business last year, and Vivint, which posted a 17% drop in residential sales volume in 2017 as it moved to prioritize profitability. Sungevity Inc. filed for bankruptcy protection last year after an aggressive growth strategy resulted in too much debt, the company said in a court filing.  The industry\u2019s sales strategies have attracted scrutiny by regulators in some states, including New Mexico, where the state attorney general, Hector Balderas, filed a lawsuit last month claiming that Vivint used \u201cfalse, misleading and fraudulent statements\u201d to sign customers up for long-term deals.  Rob Kain, Vivint\u2019s vice president of investor relations, said the company disagrees with the allegations and plans to contest them in court.  \u201cCould we have had a salesperson who was aggressive? I wouldn\u2019t be surprised,\u201d Mr. Kain said, adding that the company would have fired a salesperson for misrepresentations.  SolarCity grew with help from a hard-charging sales culture. Before being acquired by Tesla, the company, which was run by Lyndon Rive, the cousin of Tesla founder Elon Musk, tapped salespeople from the mortgage industry and Las Vegas casinos to sell solar panels, and gave them aggressive quotas, according to current and former managers and employees interviewed by The Wall Street Journal.  Last year, Tesla changed course and began selling solar panels through the same stores that sell its cars. Other sales approaches were shut down in order to \u201cfocus on projects with better margins,\u201d the company said.  Eric White, president and chief executive of Dividend Finance , a San Francisco-based company that provides loans to homeowners putting solar on their roofs, said many solar companies acted too much like Silicon Valley firms, pursuing growth at all costs in hopes of becoming leaders in a nascent market.  Mr. White said that while the industry\u2019s prior growth is \u201cnot sustainable and leaves bodies in its tracks,\u201d 5%-to-15% annual increases are achievable.  Solar energy grew rapidly in recent years as the cost of solar panels declined. The all-in cost of a typical rooftop solar system fell by 61% between 2010 and 2017 to $2.80 per watt, or roughly $16,000 for the average home system, according to the federal government.  Solar executives and industry analysts believe annual residential solar growth will resume in 2018. But two developments risk hurting sales in coming years, say industry analysts. First, new Trump administration tariffs on imported solar modules, mostly from China, are expected to marginally raise costs. Second, a federal government tax incentive to homeowners worth 30% of the value of the solar array is set to end by 2021.  Lynn Jurich, chief executive of Sunrun, said rising utility electricity rates and falling solar panel costs will drive increased interest in solar.  \u201cWe saw an unnaturally high growth rate because there was a lot of capital coming in to spend on advertising and customer origination, and not a lot of discipline on focusing on profitable growth,\u201d she said of the sector as a whole. \u201cYou suck all the advertising out of an industry and it shrinks.\u201d  Still, companies continue to spend considerable amounts acquiring customers. Sunrun estimates it spends about 28 cents on marketing for every dollar spent on purchasing and installing panels.  Sophie Karp, an analyst at Guggenheim Securities, said industrywide customer-acquisition costs were higher.  \u201cSolar is not a product that you buy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a product that gets sold.\u201d  \u2014Kirsten Grind contributed to this article.

The wreckage of a Tesla vehicle after it crashed into a barrier on U.S. Highway 101 in Mountain View, Calif., last month. Photo: stringer/Reuters  The National Transportation Safety Board expressed displeasure with Tesla TSLA 2.13% Inc.\u2019s recent disclosure that the company\u2019s semiautonomous driving system was activated before a fatal crash last month in California.  The agency, which dispatched a team last week to investigate the March 23 crash, said Sunday it is \u201cunhappy\u201d that Tesla revealed detailed information it had gleaned from vehicle logs about the collision, including its suggestion that the driver had time to put his hands on the wheel and react.  Tesla declined to comment Sunday about the NTSB statement.  The rare rebuke from the U.S. agency, which investigates significant accidents involving various transportation modes, comes amid mounting scrutiny of partial and fully automated driving technologies. The NTSB is also probing the March 18 death of a pedestrian fatally struck by an Uber Technologies Inc. self-driving vehicle with a safety operator behind the wheel in Tempe, Ariz.  Not long after the NTSB expressed its disapproval Sunday, Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk joked on Twitter that the company was going bankrupt. \u201cDespite intense efforts to raise money, including a last-ditch mass sale of Easter eggs, we are sad to report that Tesla has gone completely and totally bankrupt,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSo bankrupt, you can\u2019t believe it.\u201d  Mr. Musk\u2019s tweet, which doesn\u2019t appear to be in response to the NTSB, was timed for April Fools\u2019 Day and Easter. But it also comes at a particularly sensitive time for Tesla, which is also in a tight cash situation as it tries to ramp up production of its mass-market car, the Model 3.  Tesla is expected to report first-quarter vehicle sales numbers this week, and the market will be carefully examining the company\u2019s guidance on whether or not it can hit its oft-delayed goal, of producing 5,000 Model 3 cars each week, by the end of the second quarter. Analysts say that milestone is an inflection point for Tesla when the company can start generating cash.  Tesla\u2019s shares had surged over the past couple of years on the promise that Mr. Musk could not only deliver an all-electric car for the masses, but also fulfill his vision of creating cars that drive themselves.  Tesla\u2019s disclosure on Friday that the semiautonomous system, called Autopilot, was engaged before the fatal crash near Mountain View, Calif., immediately reignited questions about the technology. A man was killed after his Tesla Model X sport-utility traveling southbound on Highway 101 collided with a barrier and was struck by two other vehicles, according to the California Highway Patrol.  Tesla late Friday said Autopilot was activated in the seconds leading up to the crash. The driver\u2019s hands weren\u2019t detected on the wheel for six seconds before the collision, the company said. Tesla said vehicle logs showed the driver took no action despite having five seconds and about 500 feet of unobstructed view of the concrete highway divider.  On Sunday, the NTSB said it needs Tesla to decode the data recorded by the vehicle. \u201cIn each of our [past] investigations involving a Tesla vehicle, Tesla has been extremely cooperative on assisting with the vehicle data,\u201d an agency spokesman said. \u201cHowever, the NTSB is unhappy with the release of investigative information by Tesla.\u201d  Newsletter Sign-up  The NTSB said it would probe all aspects of the crash, including suggestions the driver had expressed previous concerns about Autopilot. It said it would publish a preliminary report on the investigation, likely within a few weeks of completion of field work.  \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing a thorough search of our service records and we cannot find anything suggesting that the customer ever complained to Tesla about the performance of Autopilot,\u201d Tesla said in a statement. \u201cThere was a concern raised once about navigation not working correctly, but Autopilot\u2019s performance is unrelated to navigation.\u201d  The NTSB probe won\u2019t necessarily lead to sanctions against the electric car company. The NTSB determines probable causes of accidents and makes recommendations to policy makers, but doesn\u2019t issue penalties or take other punitive actions.

The trouble is, raising it suddenly looks a lot more challenging.  Moody\u2019s Investors Service downgraded Tesla\u2019s debt on Tuesday afternoon, citing persistently negative cash flow and continued production issues with the Model 3 mass-market sedan. Moody\u2019s is keeping a negative outlook on the credit due to \u201cthe likelihood that Tesla will have to undertake a large, near-term capital raise in order to refund maturing obligations and avoid a liquidity shortfall.\u201d  Tesla\u2019s bonds due in 2025, issued just last summer, were quoted near 90 cents on the dollar after hours. Meanwhile, the stock is down 23% in about a month, making equity more expensive. There are plenty of reasons that Tesla\u2019s magic touch with the capital markets is fading fast.  For starters, Tesla\u2019s financial statements paint an alarming picture of the group\u2019s long-term viability. Tesla had $3.4 billion in cash and equivalents at the end of the year and raised an additional $550 million from bonds backed by lease payments in February. Not all of that is available for spending. Customer deposits, which are mostly refundable, topped $850 million at last count.  Tesla burned more than $3.4 billion last year in free cash, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures. If that pace were to keep up, Tesla would run out of its usable cash before this year ends. Worse still, there is reason to believe the free cash burn figure was understated.  Tesla booked $666.5 million in upfront payments to install solar-energy systems as an investing cash outflow. That normally would be an operating expense, depressing free cash flow. Tesla also has managed to flatter its operating cash flow picture by stretching its working capital. Accounts payable grew by nearly $530 million in 2017 to about $2.4 billion, while accounts receivable grew by just $15 million. The difference generated more than half a billion in cash. That was a smart move to conserve resources, but the trouble is that eventually these suppliers will demand their money. They won\u2019t be comfortable if Tesla can\u2019t meet its forecast production rate of 2,500 Model 3 cars a week by the end of the first quarter.  Newsletter Sign-up  Production issues are only one part of the Model 3 problem, however. The car doesn\u2019t seem to be in as high demand as Chief Executive Elon Musk once promised investors. Analysts at Bernstein said in a research note last week that fewer than 30% of customers who have been invited to take delivery of the Model 3 have actually done so.  And Tesla can\u2019t simply cut spending to solve its cash challenge if it hopes to ramp up production. The company has racked up about $10 billion in long- term debt and has $23 billion in total liabilities. To survive long term, Tesla needs to stop overpromising and to scale back its ambitions to goals it actually can achieve. Right now, though, it just needs more money.  More debt isn\u2019t a practical solution given the current bondholder losses. An equity raise is still possible, but the recent selloff across the tech sector won\u2019t help\u2014nor will the fact that the reality of the Model 3 has so far proven to be much less attractive than the fantasy of yesteryear.  If next week\u2019s delivery update is worse than feared, the odds of keeping the lights on through this year will get a lot longer.

TSLA 2.13% contractor has sued the auto maker claiming it hasn\u2019t been paid for work at a Fremont, Calif., assembly plant where Tesla is now trying to ramp up production of the Model 3 sedan.  American Integrated Services Inc. claims Tesla hasn\u2019t paid $513,473 for lead and asbestos abatement-related work under a $3.57 million contract signed in January 2016. It filed the lawsuit Tuesday in a California state court in Oakland.  Tesla called the matter \u201ca minor commercial dispute.\u201d  \u201cWe paid AIS for all the work we authorized them to do,\u201d a Tesla spokesman said in a statement Friday. \u201cThe additional payment they\u2019re seeking is for work that we did not authorize and that clearly was unnecessary. When we asked for documentation showing that Tesla had authorized this unnecessary work, they were unable to provide it.\u201d  The claim comes as the auto maker faces questions about its cash level while it spends heavily to ramp up production of the Model 3, a compact sedan that is designed to turn the electric-car maker from a niche player to one that sells to the masses.  Large automotive suppliers are generally loath to file claims against car makers and can often carry unpaid bills while its customer works to improve its situation, betting there will be future business to win. Small companies, however, can\u2019t always make that bet, or aren\u2019t willing to do so, especially if they don\u2019t expect to do further business with the car company.  Dennis Virag, a manufacturing consultant who has worked in the automotive industry for 40 years, said auto makers generally try to pay vendors quickly unless there is a dispute about the quality or fulfillment of a contract.  The lawsuit claims the contractor had an agreement to be paid within 30 days of receipt of invoices.  \u201cTesla purchased furnishing lead and asbestos abatement, demolition and removal and other environmental and remediation services, goods, materials, labor, supplies and equipment from on or about Feb. 19, 2017, to present,\u201d the lawsuit said.  A lawyer for American Integrated Services declined to comment, citing ongoing litigation.  Production of the Model 3 began last July and has failed to reach multiple milestones set by Tesla, including one last quarter to make as many as 2,500 sedans in a single week. Tesla on Tuesday worked to reassure investors about its capital needs for the year, saying it was on track to ramp production to around 5,000 Model 3 cars a week in about three months and that would lay the ground work for \u201cstrong positive operating cash flow\u201d in the third quarter.  \u201cAs a result, Tesla does not require an equity or debt raise this year, apart from standard credit lines,\u201d the company said in the quarterly sales report.  That update followed an April Fools\u2019 Day Twitter post by Chief Executive Elon Musk that joked the company had gone bankrupt and a report from Moody\u2019s Investors Service last week downgrading Tesla\u2019s credit rating, concerned about the company\u2019s cash levels and production delays.  The company finished last year with $3.4 billion in cash on hand after its negative cash flow averaged about $1 billion a quarter on average\u2014a pace analysts have said means the company would need to raise more money this year unless it significantly boosts production.  Tesla has more than $10 billion in debt and its accounts payable has swelled to $2.39 billion at the end of the year from $1.86 billion a year earlier.  Following Tuesday\u2019s assurance that Tesla doesn\u2019t need to raise money, several analysts said they expect the company will do so later this year. Brian Johnson, an analyst for Barclays, wrote in a note to investors that he expected Tesla would need to raise $2.5 billion in the third quarter.  \u2014Andrew Scurria and Lisa Schwartz contributed to this article.

Future cooperation could extend beyond France. A source familiar with the talks said on Tuesday that Amazon and Casino were negotiating a deal in Brazil either partnering or selling Casino\u2019s local appliance and electronics chain Via Varejo SA (VVAR3.SA).  Casino said the process of selling Via Varejo was continuing in Brazil with no new element to report and there was no partnership.  The French move, which is set to shake up the competitive local food retail market, lifted Casino shares as much as 9.7 percent in morning trade amid speculation that it could lead to a bigger deal later on.  Amazon\u2019s purchase of the bricks-and-mortar retailer Whole Foods Market Inc for $13.7 billion last year, and a deal for Amazon Prime to sell products from the British supermarket chain Morrisons (MRW.L), raised expectations that it would bid for a retailer or form a partnership in France.  Casino and Amazon said late on Monday that groceries sourced from Monoprix would be available in the Amazon Prime Now app and website through a dedicated virtual store.  The deal is limited to the lucrative Paris market and its suburbs, though Monoprix CEO Regis Schultz told a conference call that an extension to other parts of France could not be ruled out.

It has a strong focus on quality and fresh products in the mould of Whole Foods, and is a key contributor to Casino group profit.  \u201cWe consider the Monoprix product selection as exceptional,\u201d Amazon France CEO Frederic Duval said during the call.  Financial terms were not disclosed, but Schultz said a model where Monoprix does the picking of the order in store and Amazon takes care of delivery was a \u201cprofitable\u201d one for Monoprix.  Slideshow (5 Images)  COMPLEMENTS OCADO DEAL  Casino already has a delivery partnership with UK online retailer Ocado (OCDO.L), signed last year.  The two deals were complementary as the Ocado technology will allow Monoprix to address the needs of its traditional clients with a bigger basket and seeking next-day delivery. Clients of Amazon Prime, set up in Paris in 2016, are looking for fewer items and want express delivery.  Since the purchase of Whole Foods Market, expectations that Amazon could focus next on Europe have spurred French retailers to try to improve their own online offerings.  Carrefour (CARR.PA) announced in January that it would invest 2.8 billion euros in digital commerce over the next five years, six times its current investment.

One person familiar with the matter told Reuters that the probability of a deal with Amazon was low, and that any such deal could spark monopoly concerns as Flipkart and Amazon dominate India\u2019s e-commerce market. The person declined to be identified as discussions were private.  Amazon declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. Flipkart and Walmart did not respond to requests for comment.  Walmart is in talks to buy over 40 percent of Flipkart in potentially one of its biggest overseas deals, Reuters reported in February. A deal would give the world\u2019s largest brick-and-mortar retailer access to an e-commerce market that Morgan Stanley estimated to be worth $200 billion in a decade\u2019s time.  The deal would also represent a direct challenge to Amazon in Asia\u2019s third-largest economy. Amazon has committed to investing $5 billion in India as it expands into online grocery delivery.

Flipkart, founded by former Amazon employees Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal in 2007, controls nearly 40 percent of India\u2019s online retail market, ahead of Amazon, showed estimates by researcher Forrester.  Like Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, the pair began by selling books and diversified rapidly, including by selling smartphones through exclusive flash sales. Flipkart now competes with Amazon on almost all product categories.  Flipkart\u2019s success has attracted a bevy of deep-pocketed and tech-savvy investors including U.S. hedge fund Tiger Global Management LLC, online marketplace eBay Inc and software maker Microsoft Corp, as well as Chinese technology firm Tencent Holdings Ltd.

It was unclear which specific teams inside Amazon were affected. Amazon\u2019s consumer organization includes its retail and marketplace businesses, as well as programs like food delivery service Amazon Restaurants.  Seattle-based Amazon has been on a hiring tear, creating some 130,000 jobs worldwide in 2017 and announcing plans to open a second headquarters in North America, anticipating up to 50,000 more jobs there. Its full-time and part-time headcount surged 66 percent in the fourth quarter to 566,000 from a year earlier. That figure includes employees at Whole Foods Market, which Amazon acquired in a $13.7 billion deal last year.  But many of the corporate jobs are going to areas of soaring profit, like cloud-computing division Amazon Web Services, or areas where Amazon sees potential, like voice-controlled computing.  \u201cOur 2017 projections for Alexa were very optimistic, and we far exceeded them,\u201d said Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder and chief executive, in a statement earlier this month. \u201cWe don\u2019t see positive surprises of this magnitude very often \u2014 expect us to double down.\u201d  Amazon hopes Alexa will become a regular part of consumers\u2019 lives and will spur shopping orders by voice.

I will leave to others the implications for democracy when a U.S. president singles out a company that he wants to punish, but from a business point of view, his crusade is nuts. For all of Trump's huffing and puffing, there is little he can do to inflict pain on Amazon and its chief executive, Jeff Bezos. It's amazing that he can't see it.  The president complains that Amazon doesn't pay taxes. For the most part, that hasn't been true; between 2007 and 2015, it paid a combined tax rate (for federal, state, local and foreign) of 13 percent, on par with many big companies. Last year, however, it did not pay any federal taxes. Why? It appears that Amazon was able to take advantage of some provisions in Trump's pride and joy, the tax cut he signed in December. In addition, while Amazon for years fought efforts to force it to collect state and local sales tax, it has begun doing so, even collecting from its third-party vendors. Besides, there is simply no way Trump can target one company for a different tax treatment than other companies. So much for taxes.  According to the news site Axios, Trump has mused about using antitrust law to whack Amazon. In fact, there are many people who believe that big tech companies like Amazon, Facebook and Google deserve far more antitrust scrutiny than they've gotten, and indeed, that antitrust policy needs to better reflect their enormous power. I'm one of them.  But singling out Amazon is no way to go about it. It causes antitrust experts to shrink from the subject because they don't want to be seen as doing Trump's dirty work. And it puts the Justice Department's antitrust division in a terrible spot. Having already sued to stop AT&T from buying Time Warner after Trump complained about the deal, the division's leaders would look like lackeys if they went after Amazon, too. Indeed, given the current state of antitrust law, which is very forgiving of big companies making big acquisitions, there is nothing for the government to go after Amazon for.  It's possible, I suppose, that Trump could prevent Amazon from getting government contracts. In 2013, the company successfully brought cloud computing to the Central Intelligence Agency, and it is the current front-runner for a 10-year, multi-billion-dollar cloud computing contract with the Pentagon. Other tech companies are lobbying to get a piece of the contract, and perhaps the Defense Department will conclude that it's not worth inviting the president's ire to give it to the company with the most experience and biggest market share. Fear not. Amazon had over $177 billion in revenue last year and is on track to easily top $200 billion in 2018. If it never sees another penny from the government, it will do just fine.  Finally, there is the relationship that Trump has complained about most frequently: Amazon's business with the U.S. Postal Service:  I am right about Amazon costing the United States Post Office massive amounts of money for being their Delivery Boy. Amazon should pay these costs (plus) and not have them bourne by the American Taxpayer. Many billions of dollars. P.O. leaders don\u00e2t have a clue (or do they?)! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 3, 2018  Back in 2012, the Postal Service was in deep trouble. A self-financed agency since the 1980s, it had lost $25 billion over the previous six years, and $6.5 billion in just the first six months of the year. It had three big problems. First, even though it was expected to generate its own revenue, Congress made it hard to do things that could save billions, like closing rural post offices or ending Saturday delivery. Second, Congress imposed a bizarre requirement that it pre-fund retiree health-care premiums to the tune of $5.5 billion a year. And third, fewer and fewer people were sending first-class mail.  The decline in first-class mail continues today. But postal revenue has largely stabilized at around $70 billion, and losses in 2017 were down to $2.7 billion. Why? Because despite the congressional impediments, the Postal Service has done some serious cost-cutting. Also, its package-delivery business is going gangbusters. This is almost entirely thanks to Amazon, which has started to rely on the Postal Service to get packages to customers' front doors.  QuickTake Q&A: Amazon and the Post Office  Although the terms of Amazon's postal contract have never been revealed, it is implausible that the deal costs the post office money, as Trump claims. What's more, if he thinks Amazon is getting too sweet a deal, he is actually in a position to do something about it. The Postal Service's overseer, its Board of Governors, is supposed to comprise 11 people. It currently has two: Megan Brennan, the Postmaster General, and her deputy, Ronald Stroman. Every other seat is empty.  Trump has nominated three people for the board, but even if all three were approved by the Senate, the board would still lack a quorum. And without a quorum, it can't do things like, well, renegotiate big contracts. It would be easy enough for Trump to find nominees who would vow to force Amazon to pay more. But to do that, he'd have to be paying attention to his job.  Trump's real motivation is doubtless to get back at Bezos for his ownership of the Washington Post, which regularly publishes unflattering revelations about his presidency and business life. But he really should have thought twice before going after Amazon and its CEO..  There may be some chief executives who would be rattled by attacks from the president. Bezos is not one of them. You'll notice that so far he hasn't responded to Trump's tweets, and he won't. He's too smart for that. And while Trump has managed to hurt Amazon's valuation, you would be hard-pressed to find a CEO who spends less time worrying about his company's share price than Bezos. Eventually, the market will realize that Trump's threats are toothless, and the stock will come back up again.  There is a final reason why Trump's attacks on Amazon are so misguided. If he could put aside his venom for Bezos, he might be able to see that Amazon is a company that's doing exactly what he says he wants American companies to do. It's creating jobs, not just tech jobs in Seattle but blue-collar jobs in the warehouses it has built around the country. It pays most of the tuition when workers want to learn skills that will lead to better jobs. It's in the process of choosing a second headquarters city where it will eventually employ up to 50,000 workers. It's getting into health care in an effort to bring down costs. It treats customers better than any other tech company. Oh, and its chief competitor isn't an American company but a Chinese one, Alibaba.  So go after Amazon if you insist, Mr. President. But if you keep it up, this is one crusade you may live to regret.

Amazon hadn\u2019t just invaded the home turf of the home-shopping channel QVC. As it has done with food delivery, travel and online payments, the Seattle giant had more or less recreated a rival\u2019s entire approach. In this case, the weapon was an online show, \u201cStyle Code Live,\u201d staffed with bubbly millennials promoting beauty and fashion products you could buy on Amazon.  \u201cThey tried to copy everything about our show,\u201d QVC Chief Executive Officer Mike George said in an interview.  Usually, this is the moment that foreshadows doom for a rival. But QVC didn\u2019t bend to Jeff Bezos\u2019s iron will. In May 2017, a little more than a year after introducing \u201cStyle Code Live,\u201d Amazon canceled the show. The retreat proved that QVC\u2019s formula\u2014unscripted hosts demonstrating products to an audience of mostly women on live television\u2014isn\u2019t as easy as it looks. (Amazon declined to comment.)  QVC hasn\u2019t been immune to the ongoing struggles in retail and television. It had four straight quarters of sales declines before posting an increase last quarter. Sales in some categories, such as hair care and jewelry, have continued to struggle. Like many other pay-TV networks, QVC\u2019s main channel has lost subscribers as more consumers drop their cable subscriptions.  But QVC isn\u2019t just another channel trying to adapt to the rise of cord-cutting or a retail brand looking for a toehold online. About half of QVC sales already happen online, and two-thirds of those purchases come from mobile devices. In January, after completing a $2.1 billion purchase of its rival, the Home Shopping Network, QVC Group became the third largest e-commerce retailer in North America, according to Internet Retailer. That means the combined cable channels trail only Amazon.com Inc. and Walmart Inc. among companies selling products in multiple categories.  Wall Street has noticed, with shares of QVC Group, which includes QVC and smaller retail brands, soaring 51 percent in the past year. The company is owned by John Malone\u2019s Liberty Interactive Corp., which lists the business as a separate tracking stock to reflect its value.  The executives running a channel whose name stands for Quality, Value, Convenience believe their business can survive because it does something that Amazon can't: \u201cYou\u2019re not going to be inspired by Amazon,\u201d said George, a 56-year-old former McKinsey & Co. partner who buys Keurig machines on QVC as birthday gifts. \u201cShopping should be joyful. It should be inspirational. That\u2019s what we can do.\u201d  On set at the QVC campus in West Chester, Pennsylvania. Source: QVC  Standing next to a clothing rack on a recent morning, QVC host Pat James-Dementri urged viewers not to wait to buy a blouse and tank-top set. Order now, she said using a familiar lure, and you can get 30 percent off. She translated the price into the channel's signature math: \u201cThree easy pays of $16.66.\u201d  In a dark room perched above the studio, producer Kevin McGovern wore a headset and monitored two screens. One tracked call volume; the other showed the colors and sizes left. The wine-colored blouse was the hot item this morning, and that real-time dashboard helped create a sense of urgency with shoppers at home. McGovern whispered into the host\u2019s earpiece, and the information went out to QVC\u2019s 100 million homes in James-Dementri\u2019s bright voice: \u201cThe wine is flying out of here!\u201d she told viewers.  While the format looks easy, a complex ballet takes place behind the scenes to make things go smoothly. There are no teleprompters or scripts. QVC hosts improvise, fielding calls and social media questions from viewers in real time. The channel features 770 products each week on the air in the U.S., and the average shopper spends more than $1,200 a year on the network\u2019s products.  \u201cQVC is a retail format that appeals to a woman who loves to shop. It would appear this woman is born every year.\u201d  QVC broadcasts every day, except on Christmas, from a 58,000-square-foot campus in West Chester, Pennsylvania, about 30 miles outside of Philadelphia. The main studio has more than 20 sets that resemble scenes torn from a Pottery Barn catalog, with plush couches and spotless kitchens. There's a 130-seat theater used for live segments with such celebrities as chef Rachel Ray or Catherine Zeta-Jones, who recently launched a home collection. A warehouse nicknamed Noah\u2019s Ark holds 300,000 items\u2014at least two of everything that QVC features on TV each day. There are parallel broadcast operations in seven countries, including China.  In one room, a headless mannequin wore a bra as part of an upcoming segment on Breezies underwear, which was to be a featured item known as \u201cToday\u2019s Special Value.\u201d On a brightly lit set nearby, Dennis Basso, a charismatic white-haired fashion designer, held up one of his dresses as the cameras rolled. \u201cI'm telling you,\u201d Basso said, \u201cthis is sooooo special.\u201d  Seated in a conference room at QVC\u2019s headquarters, George talks about the marriage with Home Shopping Network as something that will do more than save costs or unite celebrity pitchwomen: Serena Williams and Nicki Minaj sell clothing and perfume on HSN, while Martha Stewart and Ellen DeGeneres pitch home d\u00e9cor, beauty products and other items on QVC. The combined channels, George argues, will have the resources to innovate.  HSN was the pioneer in shopping by remote control instead of requiring viewers to pick up the phone or visit a website. Following the merger, George said, QVC is in talks with Comcast Corp. to enable the cable giant\u2019s 22 million subscribers to order items on the channel from their remote controls.  But that strategy will pay off only if QVC viewers keep their cable TV subcriptions. \u201cWe expect QVC to have more difficulty acquiring new customers,\u201d Citi analyst Jason Bazinet wrote in a September note that downgraded its parent company\u2019s stock to sell.  And the shoppers that are sticking around aren\u2019t young. George describes the typical viewer as an upscale woman in her 50s. A recent summary of the stereotypical QVC fan in Philadelphia magazine evoked \u201csilver-haired grannies ordering slow cookers and vibrating belly bands from landline phones.\u201d The public perception of a certain fustiness to the home-shopping demographic makes it challenging to attract millennials.  \u201cIf you go to other online retailers, it\u2019s a transaction. When you come to QVC, it\u2019s a social experience.\u201d  QVC executives insist they\u2019re mostly protected from the pressures facing both TV networks and brick-and-mortar retailers. Cord-cutters are cost-conscious young men, they say, while QVC viewers are women of a certain age with enough disposable income to afford cable-TV subscriptions and discretionary purchases. QVC executives refer to their viewers, who are about 80 percent female, simply as \u201cshe\u201d and \u201cher.\u201d  Those celebrity deals also give the channel a measure of protection by ensuring those products aren\u2019t available on Amazon. Martha Stewart\u2019s chambray blouse and electric snowblower are exclusive to the channel, and her on-air appearances are also streamed live on her Facebook page, introducing many of Stewart\u2019s fans to the shopping channel.  To reach the younger generation, QVC introduced a TV channel, Beauty IQ, that is simulcast on Facebook Live and features beauty experts who have big followings on Instagram and YouTube. In 2015, two years before the deal for the Home Shopping Network, QVC also paid $2.4 billion for Zulily, a flash sales site aimed at millennial moms.    QVC\u2019s digital strategy has started to pay off. The channel added about 417,000 new customers last quarter, the second-biggest increase for that period in 15 years. Amazon is perpetually lurking, of course. It has started to broaden Twitch Interactive, a video-game streaming site it acquired in 2014, to allow artists, chefs and musicians to sell products to their viewers. And about three-quarters of QVC shoppers are also users of the almost inescapable e-commerce site.  But analysts increasingly see QVC\u2019s future as \u201cthe anti-Amazon,\u201d in the words of Barton Crockett at B. Riley FBR Inc. Amazon is about inexhaustible selection, he said, while a 24-hour shopping show is a matter of constant salesmanship.  \u201cQVC is a retail format that appeals to a woman who loves to shop,\u201d Crockett said. \u201cIt would appear this woman is born every year.\u201d  QVC Control room Source: QVC  Some viewers tune in to just see hosts like David Venable. A 53-year-old former TV news anchor in Altoona, Pennsylvania, Venable got his start at QVC in 1993 selling patio furniture during the overnight shift. Today, he hosts two live cooking shows each week, deploying a folksy manner that evokes his southern upbringing. His nonstop patter is filled with anecdotes about how his grandmother and mother taught him to cook.  \u201cIn the Kitchen With David\u201d is one of QVC\u2019s most popular shows, drawing on average more than 2 million viewers. Wearing his apron, Venable answers questions on social media, makes new recipes and demonstrates cookware. He has sold almost 900,000 air fryers. Whenever Venable tastes a dish he really enjoys, he raises his hands and turns in a circle while saying \u201chappy dance, happy dance\u201d over and over. It\u2019s his signature move.  \u201cWe\u2019re establishing a relationship with viewers,\u201d Venable said in an interview. \u201cIf you go to other online retailers, it\u2019s a transaction. When you come to QVC, it\u2019s a social experience.\u201d  One of his most devoted fans is Cam Brockman, a 23-year-old retail sales associate in Charlotte, North Carolina.

But what measures can he actually take against the online retail giant?  He could push for probes of consumer protection, privacy and antitrust issues. He could also step up his support for allowing states to collect sales tax on third-party purchases from Amazon, or seek to have the Postal Service charge more to deliver packages. And he could thwart Amazon\u2019s aspirations to win a multibillion dollar Pentagon contract for cloud services.  Even with those powers, Trump\u2019s ability to act has limits. Inquiries by the Justice Department or the Federal Trade Commission could take years and bear a high burden of proof. The FTC and other enforcement agencies guard their independence, as does the board of governors of the Postal Service. Changes to the tax law would require cooperation from Congress, which just passed a tax overhaul and may have limited appetite to reopen negotiations.  The feud pits the world\u2019s most powerful man against one of the world\u2019s biggest corporations -- a global titan with $684 billion in market capitalization and more than half a million employees. At stake is its reputation, revenue and, potentially, ability to continue to disrupt markets as it reshapes retailing.  Any move made by Trump that is perceived as revenge against Amazon founder Jeff Bezos for his ownership of The Washington Post would invite comparisons to President Richard Nixon, who, at the height of the Watergate scandal, threatened the Post\u2019s broadcast licenses.  Amazon didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. While Amazon rose Thursday along with most U.S. stocks, the Trump attacks helped add to the shares\u2019 headwinds on Tuesday  and Wednesday. An 8 percent drop marked Amazon\u2019s biggest two-day decline in two years.  White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters told reporters aboard Air Force One Thursday that there are no specific plans to move against the company. \u201cThe president has expressed his concerns with Amazon,\" she said.  Seek antitrust inquiry of Amazon\u2019s dominance  If the administration opens an antitrust inquiry, enforcers would have to show the company has a monopoly in a market and that it abused its dominant position. But enforcers are intently focused on harm to consumers, and Amazon\u2019s retailing platform is beloved by its customers for its breadth and convenience.  Still, the company is not without criticism. Lina Khan, director of legal policy at Open Markets Institute, a Washington think tank that advocates for tougher antitrust enforcement, says Amazon should be scrutinized. One area of concern is the way Amazon can exploit information it collects about third-party sellers to better compete against them. Amazon can use sales data it gets from these merchants to undercut them on price or start selling its own versions of their products, Khan said.  Jeff Bezos Photographer: Peter Foley/Bloomberg  \"It\u2019s possible to believe two things: one, it\u2019d be deeply troubling and improper for Trump\u2019s personal animus toward Jeff Bezos to be the basis of an antitrust action, and two, Amazon\u2019s structure and conduct raise anticompetitive concerns worthy of an antitrust investigation,\" she said.  Trump\u2019s Justice Department already has shown unorthodox thinking on antitrust enforcement. Last year it sued AT&T Inc. to stop its acquisition of Time Warner Inc. -- which owns CNN, another frequent Trump target. The move surprised many antitrust lawyers because the two companies don\u2019t compete directly.  Competing retailers have long expressed concern about Amazon\u2019s potential to push them out of business but enforcers are skeptical when complaints come from rivals because they want to see vigorous competition in markets.  Make Amazon pay sales taxes like traditional retailers  Trump\u2019s complaints about Amazon not paying sales tax echo those of states and local jurisdictions that have complained about a loss of tax revenue as sales shift from brick-and-mortar stores to Amazon.  Trump supports bipartisan bills in Congress that would allow states to mandate collection of sales taxes because U.S. policy should ensure that \"those who are competing with Amazon are on a level playing field,\" White House spokesman Raj Shah said Thursday.  In 2017, Amazon, which also supports the bills, began collecting sales tax in states that levy them, but the company doesn\u2019t charge shoppers sales tax when they buy from third-party vendors that sell on the site. Those sales make up about half the company\u2019s volume.  States and local governments lose approximately $5 billion a year in taxes from Amazon marketplace commerce because merchants don\u2019t collect them and shoppers don\u2019t pay them after the fact, according to James Thomson, a former Amazon employee who is now a consultant for e-commerce merchants. The company doesn\u2019t break out how much revenue comes from third-party sales.  The Trump administration has also urged the U.S. Supreme Court to let state and local governments collect billions of dollars in sales taxes from online retailers. The justices are scheduled to hear arguments next month centering on a South Dakota law that calls for collecting sales taxes from large internet retailers even if they don\u2019t have brick-and-mortar stores in the state. A ruling is expected by late June.  Charge Amazon higher postage  Trump has said the Postal Service should be charging Amazon more for delivery.  \u201cWhy is the United States Post Office, which is losing many billions of dollars a year, while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages, making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer?\u201d Trump told his 45 million followers in January.  A sudden increase in postal service rates would cost Amazon about $2.6 billion a year, according to an April report by Citigroup. That report predicted United Parcel Service Inc. and FedEx Corp. would also raise rates in response to a postal service hike.  The Postal Regulatory Commission, which sets rates, has one vacant seat among its five commissioners, who are named by the president.  But the Postal Service would also be a loser. Despite Trump\u2019s assertions, Amazon is a valuable customer. And the Postal Service\u2019s losses have little to do with Amazon and more to do with its large health-care obligations and the dwindling use of first-class mail. USPS charges some of the world\u2019s lowest stamp prices.  Brad Parscale, who is managing Trump\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign, hinted that the administration may act to raise Amazon\u2019s postal costs in a tweet late Thursday. \u201cOnce the markets figure out that a single @usps rule change will crush @amazon \u2019s bottom line we will see,\u201d Parscale wrote.  Weigh in against Amazon in the Cloud Wars  Amazon, which has sought government contracts beyond the Postal Service, could also face opposition to its bid to become the sole supplier of the Defense Department\u2019s multibillion dollar cloud services award, which is slated to be made in September and for which Amazon is seen as the front-runner.  The company\u2019s 2013 cloud deal with the CIA for $600 million has put it in pole position to win the award, which could last up to 10 years and put the company ahead in the race for future contracts as the Pentagon pushes to modernize its technology.  The Pentagon\u2019s announcement earlier in March that it would choose one vendor for the contract has prompted criticism from Microsoft Corp., International Business Machines Corp. and industry groups representing rivals such as Oracle Corp.  And lawmakers charged with funding the Pentagon have asked the department to justify the single-source award in language accompanying the recent spending bill.  Trump could issue an executive action that says the government can only contract with smaller firms for instance, although the president\u2019s comments could bolster Amazon\u2019s case if it decided to bring a court challenge, said John Hudak, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution.  \"The president\u2019s own rhetoric about Amazon probably hinders his ability to use executive action,\" Hudak said.  \u2014 With assistance by Lynnley Browning, and Toluse Olorunnipa", "stock": "AMZN", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-29", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-29/amazon-in-trump-s-crosshairs-here-s-what-the-president-could-do"}, {"article": "Without having done much yet, Amazon.com Inc. is already transforming U.S. health care -- and not necessarily for the better.  The mere threat of the online giant getting into the health business prompted the country's two largest pharmacy benefit managers -- CVS Health Corp. and Express Scripts Holding Co. -- to join forces with two of its largest insurers, Aetna Inc. and Cigna Corp. These deals will put more U.S. health care under the control of fewer companies. The merging companies say this will lower costs for consumers and the country. But the reality will likely be less rosy and more complicated.  Looming Amazon is worth $200 billion more than the country's five largest insurers and three largest pharmacy benefit managers -- which will shortly be consolidated into five total companies Source: Bloomberg  That these companies can even make such deals is due partly to the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, which blocked the mergers of Anthem Inc. with Cigna and Aetna with Humana Inc. Those mega-insurers would have been too busy digesting to make big vertical deals and too large to be acquired by other insurers.  UnitedHealth Group Inc. has been another major motivator for these mergers. It successfully pioneered a strategy of aggressive diversification by buying a large PBM in 2015 and with its Optum health-services unit. The gravitational pull of its success -- it leads peers in patient enrollment, revenue growth, and market valuation -- has inspired copycats. Profit pressure on PBMs, meanwhile, likely helped make them receptive to merging with insurers.  Pole Position UnitedHealth has consistently outgrown its rivals in recent years Source: Bloomberg  But Amazon's long shadow also helped instigate these deals. With its technological prowess, long investment horizon, bottomless appetite for new business and tolerance for thin margins, any mention of its interest in health care rattles investors, particularly in the industry's middlemen.  If the deals go through, the result will be an unprecedented level of market concentration.  All three of the biggest U.S. PBMs will be tied to three of the country's biggest insurers. CVS, Express Scripts, and UnitedHealth process more than 70 percent of all U.S. prescriptions. Post-merger, three companies will insure more than 90 million people in some capacity, process more than 3.5 billion prescription claims, and generate more than $500 billion in revenue.  Not every American will have both their medical and drug benefits managed by the same company. But many more will in the years to come. These integrated companies have more information about their customers and more ability and incentive to manage the totality of their health spending.  UnitedHealth is already all-encompassing, with its continuing investment in everything from ambulatory surgery centers to physician groups. CVS and Aetna -- which will add retail pharmacies and primary care clinics to the equation -- could have an unprecedented role in patient lives.  The deal spree may continue. Anthem and Humana look lonely. While Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. focuses on retail pharmacies in the U.S., its main rival's increasing breadth puts it at an uncomfortable disadvantage.  Even if this is the end of the deal-making, the impact of what has already happened will be far-ranging. Drugmakers and providers won't enjoy negotiating with these new giants. As for consumers, drug and provider options may narrow. Aetna and CVS will want to drive people to its own clinics, as UnitedHealth already does with its own provider network.  And PBMs are more effective and profitable when more people use tightly controlled drug plans; enrollees at newly affiliated insurers may find their drug choices are more restricted. The more people PBMs can push toward or away from a given medicine, the more negotiating leverage they have with drug manufacturers.  The merging companies have claimed huge cost savings will flow to consumers from these deals, but I'm skeptical. Research suggests costs can actually end up rising in some cases of health-care consolidation. Less competition means more pricing power for the companies that remain. Markets with more insurers have lower premiums, while prices rise when hospitals buy physician groups. Though these are vertical deals, they will add to the market power of major players in already heavily consolidated industries, which seems like a recipe for monopolistic behavior.  True, reducing the number of middlemen who get a taste of nearly every transaction should theoretically cut costs. And these giants will be able to compel larger discounts from drugmakers and providers. But it would be a rather large deviation from standard capitalist practice if these conglomerates don't capture most of those savings for shareholders.  The newly merged companies will have debt to pay off and must prove to investors the deals were smart. That likely won't leave much in the way of cost savings for the average customer  Amazon and its partners say they hope to create a new and better health-care system, free of the profit motive, for their employees. But the unintended consequences of their interest in the sector will impact a far larger group of Americans much sooner.

Pichai didn't mention retailers' fear of Amazon, but he did use the term \"flywheel effect,\" which -- ahem -- is a favorite phrase of Bezos.  Diane Greene, the leader of Google's cloud business, was more direct about the company's motivations this week. At a conference, she said Google was considered a helping hand by retailers, software makers and companies in other industries that aren't eager to use Amazon's cloud service. \"Now everybody is looking at Amazon,\" Greene said. \"We're their friend.\"  That's what you'd expect Google to say, of course. But there's anecdotal evidence that some companies really are avoiding Amazon Web Services, its cloud business. Supermarket chain Kroger Co. uses Microsoft and Google cloud products, but not Amazon's. \"It doesn't make sense for us to do a ton to help grow that business for them,\" a Kroger executive told CNBC last fall. Stock analysts at Piper Jaffray have also heard financial-services and logistics companies expressing concern about using Amazon products, and going to Microsoft instead.  Run down the list of private sectors that spend the most on information technology -- health care, banking, retail, insurance -- and all of them worry Amazon is coming for them. To be sure, it's hard to quantify the Amazon fear effect on Amazon itself. Growth in the company's e-commerce sales and cloud revenue shows few signs of slowing. AWS actually reaccelerated in the fourth quarter.  Amazon Warrior Amazon's revenue reached nearly $180 billion in 2017, and it is growing at more than 25% a year Source: Bloomberg  Amazon paranoia is not new. Some companies have long avoided selling their products on Amazon or using the company's payments tools. My colleague Sarah McBride also wrote more than a year ago about retailers encouraging one another to ditch AWS over concern their money would strengthen Amazon's e-commerce operation.  What's changed is that Amazon has entered a more Death Star-ish phase. After the stunning acquisition of grocery chain Whole Foods last summer, it seemed any company or industry might be in Amazon's sights. Worries about the company's potential incursions may have motivated a $68 billion health care merger. This is not normal.  The widespread corporate fear of Amazon even got the attention of the Onion, which last year published a satirical opinion piece written by \"Jeff Bezos\" with the headline: \"My advice to anyone starting a business is to remember that someday I will crush you.\" Good advice.

And their parents. And most of their grandparents.  But one group of potential customers has eluded the world\u2019s biggest Internet retailer.  Teenagers, otherwise known as Generation Z, with their lack of debit and credit cards, their absence of bank accounts and their overwhelming preference for actually putting on clothes and going to physical stores to buy things they could purchase online, pose a big challenge to Amazon.  Amazon\u2019s answer: The internet behemoth is in early discussions with banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Capital One Financial Corp. to create a product similar to checking accounts, according to people familiar with the matter who requested anonymity. Amazon aims to tailor the accounts to appeal especially to youngsters and those who own no plastic in their wallets, the people said.  Debit Devotees Consumers between the ages of 18-24 prefer debit cards to other forms of payments Source: Total System Services Inc.  \u201cThe sooner you can start collecting information on them, the better prepared you are,\u201d said Tim Barefield, a managing director at the consulting firm Kotter International. \u201cFor Amazon, it\u2019s another way to expand their brand. Their brand is reaching out every place that their tentacles can reach out to.\u201d  The move shows Amazon\u2019s recognition that digital accounts for minors potentially lock in lifetime customers before they even leave their parents\u2019 house. Amazon is savvy about its users\u2019 life cycles. It offers new parents discounts on diapers and baby food. It gives college students discounted Amazon Prime memberships, providing free shipping and access to streaming video so young adults will already be Amazon shoppers when they start making more of their own spending decisions.  Pseudo Card  Since many young people don\u2019t qualify for credit cards, Amazon created a pseudo-debit card called Amazon Cash that lets teenagers drop off money at drugstores such as 7-Eleven Inc. and CVS Health Corp. and add it to an Amazon wallet they can use online.  But Amazon has long known the process is clunky and has wanted to take steps to make it easier for customers without bank accounts to shop on its website. Walmart Inc. and American Express Co. offer accounts called Bluebird that have made inroads with teens.  Amazon, led by billionaire Jeff Bezos, is trying to stay on top even as it had revenue of $178 billion last year, a 31 percent jump from 2016 and an almost 2,500 percent increase from 2004, when many of these potential new customers were born.  Service Charges  Children under the age of 18 typically aren\u2019t able to sign up for a bank account without parental consent. Checking accounts for high school students often come with monthly service charges and overdraft fees.  So there\u2019s a chance for Amazon to improve the banking experience, said Stuart Sopp, chief executive officer of Current, a startup that offers debit cards to teens.  \u201cI\u2019m sure Amazon is scaring the hell out of every single regional bank and credit union right now,\u201d Sopp said. \u201cThe banks have very clearly not serviced these demographics, so there\u2019s opportunity.\u201d  Check Yes Consumers said they were open to banking with Amazon, even if it came with a fee Source: Cornerstone Advisors, StrategyCorps  If Amazon could deliver a better banking experience for digitally savvy youngsters who are used to getting what they want with a few swipes or clicks, they might have banking customers for a long time, said Eric Marks, a senior director at the financial consultancy West Monroe Partners.  Amazon might also entice teens with its personal assistant Alexa. Such devices are popular among teens looking for a convenient way to pay, said Gavin Rosenberg, a senior director at the payments processor Total System Services Inc.  \u201cThe younger generations are less concerned about privacy, so they\u2019re more apt to use them,\u201d Rosenberg said.  Adults, Too  The marketing opportunity doesn\u2019t end with teenagers. The e-commerce giant could also end up persuading people to close their existing bank accounts and open a new one with Amazon, according to a Cornerstone Advisors study published in January. It would also be a chance for a bank to partner with the online gargantuan.  \u201cRight now, banks might not be offering exactly what millennials want or need,\u201d said Marielle Schurig, a financial adviser at UBS Group AG who works with high-net-worth millennials. \u201cA lot of monthly statements don\u2019t offer insights or tools to manage your records or analyze your spending to budget or save for the future\u201d -- something Amazon might provide.

Though filled with less import than the company\u2019s $13.4 billion acquisition of Whole Foods Market last year, the deal was the second-largest in Amazon\u2019s history. And like all acquisitions, it gives us a rare glimpse into the way Jeff Bezos sees the future.  In the short term, Ring gives Amazon another piece in its Alexa puzzle and a leg up in its race against Google and Apple to control homes that will increasingly be filled with connected appliances. Alexa is a nice novelty now, great for serving up the weather, reading the news and hosting the occasional trivia game. But it will be really useful when it\u2019s the hub that lets people use their voice to arm their security systems, open locked doors and flash video of the person who\u2019s ringing the doorbell out front. Google understands this as well; the new $229 Nest doorbell will come with a free Google Home Mini when it starts shipping this spring.  Alexa currently works with a host of third-party smart home products. But owning Ring\u2019s varied assortment of video doorbells, security cameras and accessories allows Amazon to accelerate their development and make them exclusive to Alexa. (It bought a similar company, Blink, last year.) Amazon can also do the typical Amazon thing and lower prices, probably by incorporating the optional subscription plans for keeping recorded video into the soup of benefits that is a Prime membership.  There\u2019s also a medium-term benefit to adding Ring. Package theft, a.k.a. \u201cporch pirates,\u201d is a rampant problem in much of the country, one that has required Amazon delivery people to start emailing customers photographs of packages left by the front door, and which, in the past, has forced the company to restrict same-day delivery from neighborhoods with high crime rates. Last year, Amazon introduced a home camera and a service called Amazon Key, which automatically opens doors for verified delivery people. Amazon Key works with so-called \u201csmart locks\u201d made by other companies. Ring doesn\u2019t sell door locks just yet, but you can imagine a day when Amazon owns all the components to make such a service work.  The implications of the Amazon-Ring deal are really interesting to contemplate when we start thinking farther out. We know Amazon wants to deliver groceries. But leaving bags of kale and cartons of milk outside for hours doesn\u2019t work, and many Amazon Fresh subscribers aren\u2019t crazy about accumulating those bulky blue totes filled with dry ice. When Amazon is behind your home security system, your doorbells and door locks, Amazon workers will be able to walk in, unpack the bags and bring the milk right to the refrigerator.  But why stop with groceries? With its endless appetites, Amazon wants to expand in the massive home-services category, fertile ground for companies like Handy Technologies Inc. and Thumbtack Inc. Imagine sitting at school or in your office and being able to buzz in the cable guy or a plumber after verifying they are who they say they are with live video on your phone.

One of Katz\u2019s early investors was John Doerr of venture firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. The firm was taken by the Japanese idea of keiretsu, a network of like-minded companies that support one another through partnerships and equity stakes. Audible and Amazon.com Inc. seemed like ideal candidates, Doerr told Katz when suggesting a team-up with Bezos: \u201cHe likes books, too.\u201d  Katz on the steps of a Newark, N.J., church Audible acquired and is turning into a 400-employee \u201ctechnology center.\u201d Photographer: Meron Menghistab for Bloomberg  Katz flew to Seattle and met Bezos for coffee. Audible\u2019s success, Katz acknowledged, would rely on an impending internet revolution, where both portable digital media players and the practice of downloading files over high-speed data networks became commonplace. Bezos told Katz he was focusing on selling physical books, because it\u2019d be a quicker way to go mainstream. Audible, he predicted, was an idea that would take a decade to mature.  The two men kept in touch. At various points, Bezos stepped up involvement in Audible, until Amazon bought the company outright in 2008, leaving Katz to run it as an independent subsidiary. By the time of the acquisition, Audible had created a market for book lovers doing the dishes or on a jog. \u201cI began to think you could take all this time, which is dead time, and potentially make it reading time,\u201d Katz says.  As Amazon has in the years since, Audible first built the infrastructure for a novel form of media consumption, then slowly trained customers to adopt it. While the traditional media industry was apathetic or resistant, the company gradually increased the production of its own material. Audible has continued to bet heavily on this approach, starting a division late last year to produce original content on a much larger scale.  Today, Amazon is the book industry\u2019s b\u00eate noire, while Audible and its rivals represent a tiny bright spot for the beleaguered publishing industry. Audiobook sales totaled $2.1 billion in 2016, the most recent year for which data are available, according to the Audio Publishers Association. That\u2019s about 18 percent higher from the previous year and two and a half times the market size when Amazon bought Audible.  Audible accounts for about 41 percent of all audiobooks sold, including digital and physical formats, according to researcher Codex Group LLC. Amazon also sells audiobooks directly through its website and, with Audible, accounts for more than half the market. Audible doesn\u2019t disclose financial information, but says its annual subscriber growth is in double digits. Most customers pay $15 for a monthly subscription that comes with a single audiobook. (A la carte, they often cost more than $20.) The company\u2019s library includes 400,000 titles.  For years, the company operated without any real competition on the fringes of the $26 billion publishing industry. Google and Walmart Inc., though, have recently announced plans to sell audiobooks online. Publishers are growing more aggressive about retaining the rights to produce audio versions of their books, and the price of such rights is increasing quickly. \u201cWe don\u2019t like to work with Audible. Working with Amazon is always a treacherous affair,\u201d says Dennis Johnson, co-founder of Brooklyn-based Melville House Publishing. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly concerned with their dominance in the marketplace.\u201d  Katz says there\u2019s been outcry at every technological innovation in media, from recorded music to the paperback book. He argues the creation of the digital audiobook industry benefited even his critics.  Bezos in 1997. Photographer: Paul Souders  There was an audiobooks market, kind of, when Katz began working on Audible in the mid-1990s. They came as either huge boxes of cassettes or CDs, or in more accessible versions that were brutally abridged. Katz, who\u2019d written three books by that time, was appalled by sloppily condensed audiobooks where narrators adopted the flattest affects possible. \u201cThey did things to books that, from a writer\u2019s perspective, were unconscionable,\u201d he says.  The idea for Audible occurred to him as he was hitting a wall with a book project about how technology was going to change culture. He found the ideas convincing but struggled to write about trends that hadn\u2019t yet taken hold. He also worried that he\u2019d peaked with Home Fires, a 1992 book tracking a single Long Island family from World War II to the early \u201990s. He decided to turn his latest project into a startup instead.  Enlisting the help of a college roommate who was working in Silicon Valley, Katz developed a proposal for a company that would make digital audio players, then build a store of digital audiobooks to download onto them. He raised $3 million in funding, half from Doerr\u2019s firm, and set up shop in a former dentist\u2019s office in Montclair, N.J. It was slow work. By 1999, Audible had about 3,000 listeners.  Of course, in the Pets.com era, that seemed like enough of an audience to take the company public. It raised $38 million in an initial public offering in July 1999, and watched the price of its shares double on the first day of trading. But when the dot-com bubble collapsed the following year, Audible went down with it. In its wake, the late comedian Robin Williams, who\u2019d accepted equity in Audible as payment for his work on a spoken-word comedy project, said Katz had paid him \u201cin Confederate currency.\u201d Nasdaq delisted Audible\u2019s shares in 2003.  By then, Amazon had bought 5 percent of the company, and Apple Inc. provided an even bigger lifeline when it integrated Audible\u2019s proprietary file format into early versions of the iPod. Thanks largely to the iPod, Audible\u2019s revenue surged almost sevenfold from 2001 to 2006, Katz says.  It wasn\u2019t enough. The company had lost money every year but one and lived in fear of a hypothetical well-financed competitor spending it into oblivion. In 2006, Katz began talking in earnest to Bezos about being acquired. At the time, Amazon was preparing its first major foray into digital media with the Kindle. In 2007 it bought Brilliance Audio, another audiobook publisher. In early 2008, Amazon agreed to buy Audible for about $300 million in cash. It was two years behind the timeline for maturity that Bezos had laid out when the two men first met.  Since the deal, Katz has built a prominent profile in Newark, N.J. He gives free Audible subscriptions to public school students, is turning an historic church into a 400-employee \u201ctechnology center,\u201d and enthusiastically endorses the city\u2019s pitch to put Amazon\u2019s second headquarters there. Amazon recently said Newark was one of 20 cities it\u2019s considering as a location. Katz laughingly demurs when asked whether he\u2019s called Bezos to plead the city\u2019s case. \u201cEveryone at Amazon knows my beliefs about Newark,\u201d he says.  It\u2019s sometimes unclear how close Audible wants Amazon to come. The parent company has provided relief from the public markets, capital, and access to its tech. Audible\u2019s engineers got an early look at the Echo speaker to start planning their integration into Amazon\u2019s voice-control platforms, and current and former Audible employees say the connection helped with recruitment. Yet Katz wants to ensure Audible is seen as its own entity with a separate culture. \u201cOverplaying the Amazon part of our story tends to track away from reality,\u201d he says.  In some cases, the company could stand to benefit from greater oversight. In an email to employees last November, Katz acknowledged complaints that the workplace was \u201cless of a safe space for women than it has been intended to be.\u201d Two senior executives resigned after an ensuing investigation, and the company says it will introduce new anti-harassment training, declining to comment further.  Audible is firmly entrenched as the king of its small hill. It\u2019s the only recognizable audiobook brand, and because customers pay for monthly subscriptions rather than buy each book a la carte, they\u2019re less prone to comparison shop. Audible customers, who range from subway riders to folks washing their dishes, spend an average of two hours a day with the app.  The company\u2019s hand in the retail market is even greater than it first appears. For years, Audible and Apple had a deal where Audible would provide the actual files that Apple sells through iTunes, giving Audible a cut of every sale from its most significant competitor. The deal included an exclusivity clause preventing Apple from sourcing audiobooks from other companies, and Audible agreed not to provide its files to competing platforms. Last year the two companies ended the deal after European publishers complained it was anticompetitive.  Michele Cobb, executive director of the Audio Publishers Association, says this is likely to spur competition. \u201cThere are just a lot more players than there were three years ago,\u201d she says. The most powerful rivals may be Google and Walmart, though neither company has yet mounted a serious challenge.  Competition to make audiobooks has ramped up in recent years, adding to Audible\u2019s library. There were more than 50,000 audiobooks produced in 2016, according to the APA, more than twice the number two years earlier.  The appetite for new titles has pushed up the price of audiobook rights, according to publishers. \u201cThe cost of rights has increased in recent years because of the rapid growth in the marketplace,\u201d says Troy Juliar, chief content officer of Recorded Books, which publishes about 4,000 audiobooks a year. Literary agents are increasingly interested in retaining audio rights, and publishers often refuse to sign book deals without them.  If publishers frequently choose to work around Audible, the company has also looked to lessen its reliance on publishers. In 2016 it launched a podcast service. Last year it announced it was investing $5 million in theater productions that could be easily converted into a smartphone format.  David Blum, who spent most of the past decade running Amazon\u2019s Kindle Singles operation, now runs Audible\u2019s original publishing operation. Blum\u2019s official charge is to increase the number of Audible projects that aren\u2019t simply readings of the printed word. Margaret Atwood, author of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, recently worked with Audible to write and record a spoken-word coda to the novel, and comedian David Spade is developing an audio-only memoir. \u201cWe\u2019re really trying to break the boundaries,\u201d Blum says, \u201cand go to writers and creators and artists to think outside the traditional boundaries of what is a book.\u201d", "stock": "AMZN", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-13", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-13/amazon-turbocharged-audible-s-domination-of-audiobooks"}, {"article": "The Amazon blame game took another turn on Thursday, when President Donald Trump spun the wheel back around to the U.S. Postal Service. Amazon.com Inc. is a convenient scapegoat for just about any issue. The mail is no different.  Amazon isn\u2019t killing the post office. Since signing a landmark contract in 2013 to expand their business relationship and deliver packages on Sunday, revenue has ticked up; losses are down; and shipping is just about the only growth segment in the mailbag. The Postal Service is saddled by larger issues. Sure, there\u2019s the internet, and nobody is sending postcards anymore, but the big financial dilemma is the agency\u2019s yearly obligation to set aside cash to cover health care costs for future retirees. This accounts for billions in losses.  Give Up? U.S. Postal Service makes small improvements but is nowhere close to sustainable Source: U.S. Postal Service  U.S. mail is also required to cover every American, employing carriers who roam neighborhoods six days a week (or seven, if Amazon has a package ready). The Postal Service has said it actually makes money on the Amazon deal. E-commerce revenue provides \u201cessential support to pay for the network and infrastructure that enables us to fulfill our universal service obligation,\u201d David Partenheimer, a spokesman for the Postal Service, wrote in a January op-ed. \u201cAll users of the mail benefit.\u201d  The Amazonification of U.S. Mail Shipping revenue overtook junk mail for the first time last year Source: U.S. Postal Service  Amazon rebuilt its delivery network around the post several years ago. The company operates \u201c sortation centers\u201d that complement warehouses and organize packages by zip code before sending them to post offices for the final leg of delivery. In Kenosha, Wisconsin, Amazon has a million-square-foot warehouse, connected to a 500,000-square-foot sort center with a covered conveyor belt that resembles an airport skybridge.  Ending the U.S. mail relationship would probably be a bigger setback for Amazon than for the Postal Service. On a dark day in late 2011 when the postmaster general proposed cutting 100,000 staff and shutting thousands of post offices, EBay Inc. shares dropped more than 6 percent. Amazon\u2019s deal came soon after, and radical cuts were avoided\u2014probably not a coincidence.  So the e-commerce giant got the Postal Service off life support, but any benefit beyond that is minimal. Nothing short of a complete overhaul of the mail system, some kind of bankruptcy-style financial restructuring or reneging on those health-care promises would turn the Postal Service into a sustainable business.  Maybe that\u2019s Trump\u2019s goal. Building an antitrust case against Amazon\u2014an idea the President has floated\u2014is a tall order. Amazon\u2019s five-year contract with the Postal Service could be up for renewal this year. Breaking up that relationship would be an easier way for Trump to inflict pain on the # AmazonWashingtonPost, as he calls it.

But no one expected him to pull in Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon, too.  News Tuesday that Bezos\u2019s Amazon.com Inc., Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co., led by Dimon, plan to join forces to change how health care is provided to their combined 1 million U.S. employees sent shock waves through the health-care industry.  The plan, while in early stages and focused solely on the three giants\u2019 staff for now, seems almost certain to set its sights on disrupting the broader industry. It\u2019s the first big move by Amazon in the sector after months of speculation that the internet behemoth might make an entry. The Amazon-Berkshire-JPMorgan collaboration will likely pressure profits for middlemen in the health-care supply chain.  Details were scant in a short joint statement on Tuesday. The three companies said they plan to set up a new independent company \u201cthat is free from profit-making incentives and constraints.\u201d  It was enough to sink health-care stocks. Express Scripts Holding Co. and CVS Health Corp., which manage pharmacy benefits, slumped 6.9 percent and 4.9 percent, respectively. Health insurers such as Cigna Corp. and Anthem Inc. and biotechnology companies also dropped.  The group announced the news in the very early stages because it plans to hire a CEO and start partnering with other organizations, according to a person familiar with the matter. The effort would be focused internally first, and the companies would bring their data and bargaining power to bear on lowering health-care costs, the person said. Potential ways to bring down costs include providing more transparency over the prices for doctor visits and lab tests, as well as by enabling direct purchasing of some medical items, the person said.  \u201cI\u2019m in favor of anything that helps move the markets a bit, incentivizes competition and puts pressure on the big insurance carriers,\u201d said Ashraf Shehata, a partner in KPMG LLP\u2019s health care and life sciences advisory practice in the U.S. \u201cAn employer coalition can do a lot of things. You can encourage reimbursement models and provide incentives for the use of technology.\u201d  \u201cHard as it might be, reducing health care\u2019s burden on the economy while improving outcomes for employees and their families would be worth the effort,\u201d Bezos said in the statement. \u201cSuccess is going to require talented experts, a beginner\u2019s mind, and a long-term orientation.\u201d  The initial focus of the new company will be on technology solutions that will provide U.S. employees and their families with simplified, high-quality and transparent health care at a reasonable costs. In the statement, JPMorgan CEO Dimon said the initiative could ultimately expand beyond the three companies.  \u201cOur goal is to create solutions that benefit our U.S. employees, their families and, potentially, all Americans,\u201d he said.  HTA Alliance  Amazon, Berkshire and JPMorgan are among the largest private employers in the U.S. And they\u2019re among the most valuable, with a combined market capitalization of $1.6 trillion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  This isn\u2019t the first time big companies have teamed up in an effort to tackle health-care costs. International Business Machines Corp., Berkshire\u2019s BNSF Railway and American Express Co. were among the founding members of the Health Transformation Alliance, which now includes about 40 big companies that want to transform health care. The group ultimately partnered with existing industry players including CVS and UnitedHealth Group Inc.\u2019s OptumRx.  Top Team  The latest effort is being spearheaded by Todd Combs, who helps oversee investments at Berkshire; Marvelle Sullivan Berchtold, a managing director of JPMorgan; and Beth Galetti, a senior vice president for human resources at Amazon.  Todd Combs Photographer: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg  Buffett handpicked Combs in 2010 as one of his two key stockpickers. Combs, 47, has been taking on a larger role at Berkshire in recent years, and Buffett has said that Combs and Ted Weschler, who also helps oversee investments, will eventually manage the company\u2019s whole portfolio. Combs also joined JPMorgan\u2019s board in 2016.  Sullivan Berchtold joined JPMorgan in August after eight years at the Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis AG, where she was most recently the global head of mergers and acquisitions, according to her LinkedIn profile.  One of the highest ranking women at Amazon, Galetti has worked in human resources at the e-commerce giant since mid-2013, becoming senior vice president almost two years ago, according to her LinkedIn profile. As of late 2017 she was the only woman on Amazon\u2019s elite S-team, a group of just over a dozen senior executives who meet regularly with Bezos, according to published reports. Previously Galetti worked in planning, engineering and operations at FedEx Express, the cargo airline of FedEx Corp. She has a degree in electrical engineering from Lehigh University and an MBA from Colorado Technical University.  The management team, location of the headquarters and other operational details will be announced later, the companies said.  Health-care spending was estimated to account for about 18 percent of the U.S. economy last year, far more than in other developed nations. Buffett has long bemoaned the cost of U.S. health care. Last year, he came out in favor of drastic changes in the U.S. health system, telling PBS NewsHour that government-run health care is probably the best approach and would bring down costs.  \u201cThe ballooning costs of health care act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy,\u201d Buffett said in Tuesday\u2019s statement. \u201cOur group does not come to this problem with answers.

If the Berkshire/JPMorgan venture is as ambitious as it seems, incumbents are in trouble.  The great and oft-heralded Amazon.com Inc. foray into health care is here, and it's not what we expected.  The company isn't diving headlong into drug distribution or becoming a pharmacy benefit manager (PBM). Along with JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Berkshire Hathaway Inc., it announced a more interesting idea Tuesday -- a new company aimed at lowering the cost of employee health coverage.  Though no one sector will face the full wrath of Bezos, this joint venture is a potential competitive threat to all of health care's many middlemen.  Bad News, Guys The vague but potentially dreadful news of an Amazon/Berkshire Hathaway/JPMorgan health care venture sank managed care and PBM stocks on Tuesday Source: Bloomberg  This isn't Corporate America's first stab at controlling ballooning health-care costs. Caterpillar Inc. runs its own PBM for employees. Forty plus U.S. companies are part of the Health Transformation Alliance, founded in 2016 to \"fix our broken health care system\" by pooling data and uniting to wrest better terms from PBMs, among other things.  But Amazon, Berkshire and JPMorgan seem to have bigger ambitions than just negotiating prices with service providers. You don't need to create a whole new company or devote significant resources to do that.  A key line in the detail-light release announcing the new company is that it will be \"free from profit-making incentives.\" That looks like a shot at PBMs and health insurers, who try to lower costs but also maximize profit for stakeholders, resulting in a perverse and very expensive system. But it could also be aimed at health-care providers, given their Byzantine pricing and the outsize share of costs they represent.  The release said the new company's \"initial focus\" will be on using technology to provide simpler, cheaper, and more transparent health care for employees of the three founding firms. Whatever that means, it seems likely the ultimate aim may be to independently design and run employee health coverage.  With nearly 1.2 million employees and hundreds of billions in combined revenue -- along with the combined expertise of three of the most successful companies in history -- Amazon, Berkshire and JPMorgan have the requisite firepower to do this.  A Bit of Muscle Amazon, Berkshire, and JPMorgan have scale and financial firepower to put behind their new health-care venture Source: Bloomberg/fililngs  Insurers and PBMs now must worry about other companies following this blueprint. Even scarier for them is the idea that the Amazon/Berkshire/JPMorgan company will eventually recruit other employers to join it. That's a real possibility, given the venture's ambition and the fact that it's creating a new company rather than a less-formal alliance. In the release, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon teased the idea of potentially helping \"all Americans.\"  Incumbents aren't necessarily doomed just yet. This venture is in its infancy, and health care is complicated. The U.S. system is opaque, fragmented, and heavily regulated. Technology is often proclaimed as a health-care cost panacea, and rarely delivers.  The most effective way to reduce health-care costs is to restrict choice. People hate when they are denied their preferred care or medicine by an insurer or PBM. Imagine the reaction (and broader brand consequences) if Amazon is doing the denying.  There's also the question of negotiating power. The triumvirate may have 1.2 million employees, but UnitedHealth Group Inc. -- to take one example -- provides or manages employee health insurance for nearly 30 million people.  But because the new company isn't initially trying to make a profit and will likely aim to avoid paying high fees to middlemen, it may not have to push provider or drug prices quite as low to get a good result. Think the difference between active and passive management, but for health care.  The pedigree of the companies involved and the current lack of detail may have me reading too much into this effort. But if it's as ambitious as it sounds, then health-care incumbents are in trouble.

From 2013 to 2016, the USPS averaged a net loss of $5.3 billion per year. The reasons behind those losses, though, are more complicated than the way Trump seems to see it. According to the president, the financial woes of the Postal Service have much to do with the deal it has with Amazon.com to deliver the internet retailer\u2019s packages.  Leaving aside Trump\u2019s claims about the Postal Service\u2019s deal with Amazon (which is not a money loser) and his probable reasons for treating it like a pi\u00f1ata (he\u2019s no fan of Amazon Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos, who also happens to be the owner of the Washington Post, a leading chronicler of this administration\u2019s foibles) the president is right to be concerned with the state of the USPS. The question is whether Trump actually wants to fix the agency or simply tweet about it. If he wants to fix it, there are a number of things he could do.  For starters, he could support a group of U.S. senators with a set of postal reform proposals that could return the agency to solvency. In late March, Senator Tom Carper (D-Del.), introduced a bill with a bipartisan co-sponsorship that would move retired postal workers into Medicare, eliminating the agency\u2019s unfunded health-care liabilities and its need to set aside huge sums to cover them. Naturally, some congressional deficit hawks have complained that this would just shift these costs from one side of the federal ledger to the other. Yet the USPS, the second-largest contributor to Medicare after the federal government, has said such a plan would only raise the government\u2019s annual Medicare costs by a 10th of 1 percent.  Ten Years of Losses Net loss, U.S. Postal Service Data: USPS; graphic by Bloomberg Businessweek  The Senate bill, introduced March 22, would also restore half of the 4.3 percent emergency rate increase on items like first-class mail that the Postal Regulatory Commission granted the agency in 2013 only to revoke it three years later. It didn\u2019t matter that first-class mail continued its inexorable decline as more people used email and pay their bills online. The result was a decline in American stamp prices, already among the lowest in the developed world, from 49 cents to 47 cents, which only added to the losses at the USPS.  These are worthy ideas, endorsed with rare unanimity by USPS management, postal worker unions, and many of the institution\u2019s largest customers. Without White House support, however, the Senate bill is likely to wither and die, a fate suffered by other promising reform proposals in recent years. The tragedy isn\u2019t that Trump has yet to express any interest in pushing such ideas, it\u2019s that he appears not to understand how the agency actually functions.  As reported by Bloomberg News, Trump expressed a desire to aides last summer to raise the Postal Service\u2019s rates for delivering Amazon packages. According to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity, Trump\u2019s staff explained to him that the Postal Service is an independent organization and its mail rates are set by a commission.  American presidents have a history of getting involved in matters postal, usually for the better. In 1792, George Washington signed the country\u2019s first postal act, which included lower rates for newspapers in an effort to create an informed citizenry. It was so effective that French political philosopher Alexis De Tocqueville praised the American postal system as \u201cthe great link between minds\u201d when he visited the country in 1831. Trump\u2019s idol Andrew Jackson was so enamored with the Postal Service that he moved it into the president\u2019s cabinet after he was elected in 1828 and stuffed it with his political supporters, a practice that continued for more than a century.  Montgomery Blair, Abraham Lincoln\u2019s postmaster general, introduced free home delivery in cities at a time when most people had to endure long lines at the post office to get their letters. Under Woodrow Wilson, the Postal Service introduced airmail in 1918, clearing the runway for the commercial aviation industry. Richard Nixon signed a bill in 1970 removing the USPS from the president\u2019s cabinet in an effort to remove it from the political hurly-burly and give it the nimbleness of a private company. Unfortunately, it was still subject to heavy-handed congressional and regulatory oversight and often struggled to break even.  In 2006, President George W. Bush signed a bill giving the USPS long overdue power to negotiate package shipping deals like the Amazon one. Unfortunately, the bill required the USPS to set aside $5 billion a year to prefund the health benefits of its future retirees. It wasn\u2019t long before the Great Recession arrived, causing mail volume to plummet.  Decline in Volume of All Mail Number of pieces Data: USPS; graphic by Bloomberg Businessweek  The financial burdens that the Bush administration imposed were clearly untenable. Yet Bush\u2019s successor Barack Obama did virtually nothing to alleviate the situation. During his 2008 presidential campaign, Obama quipped, \u201cUPS and FedEx are doing fine. It\u2019s the post office that\u2019s always having problems.\u201d Postal workers understandably took issue with his remark. Once Obama was in the White House, his administration quietly supported the USPS\u2019s plan to end Saturday delivery, which would have saved $2 billion a year. It died in Congress because it was vociferously opposed by postal workers unions and congressional representatives from rural areas who said their constituents depended on traditional mail delivery. Meanwhile, the USPS\u2019s losses mounted, and it was forced to cut hours at rural post offices and slow first-class mail delivery in a vain attempt to make ends meet.  Presidents no longer have the control over the Postal Service that they did in Jackson or Wilson\u2019s day. Today, they get to appoint its board of governors. That\u2019s about it for their formal powers, but they can use the bully pulpit to push for change. That\u2019s what Trump is attempting to do now on Twitter in his criticisms of Amazon and the USPS. The problem is that he\u2019s focused on the wrong issues. He returned to Twitter on April 2, recycling an argument made last year by Citigroup analysts who argued that, properly accounted for, the USPS was losing an average of $1.50 on every Amazon package.  It\u2019s a complicated, legalistic case based on the presumption that the USPS, which declines to disclose the agreement\u2019s terms, is essentially providing Amazon a free ride on its letter delivery network rather than requiring it to pay the full costs of the service. That notion excites people at UPS and FedEx and their investors, but few others seem to take it seriously. (The conservative Wall Street Journal editorial page, a frequent critic of the USPS, shrugged it off on Tuesday.)  The reality is that the USPS needs more customers like Amazon, not fewer. It\u2019s required by law to visit every address in the country six days a week regardless of how many bills, greeting cards, and catalogs its letter carriers lug in their sacks. With first-class mail and the junkier kind disappearing, the USPS needs something else to put through the network to make money. Postal workers have a saying: \u201cThe internet giveth, and the internet taketh away,\u201d which is to say the agency\u2019s future lies in online shopping. Amazon is the first retailer to integrate its distribution system into the Postal Service\u2019s network, constructing sorting centers around the country to funnel packages to local post offices so letter carriers can tote them to people\u2019s doors. As e-commerce continues to account for more of what Americans spend, it provides a potential path to a healthier financial future for the USPS.  This vision of the agency\u2019s future is something a shrewd president might champion, but it would require Trump to stop making dubious claims about the reasons for the Postal Service\u2019s financial difficulties. He might even admit that he\u2019s been wrong about the Amazon deal. Unfortunately, that\u2019s not Trump\u2019s style.

The online retail giant plans to roll out two-hour delivery at Whole Foods this year to those who pay for Amazon's $99-a-year Prime membership. It is the company's biggest move since it bought the organic grocer last year.  It's also precisely the action rivals have been preparing for since the day Amazon \u2014 with the Prime program that's been so successful in cementing customer loyalty \u2014 announced plans to buy Whole Foods.  Amazon shoppers can order meat, seafood and other Whole Foods grocery items through the Prime Now app and website. Deliveries started Thursday in Austin, Texas; Cincinnati; Dallas; and Virginia Beach, Virginia; and will expand nationwide this year.  While convenient, not everyone wants other people picking out their eggs or fruit. A major hurdle for companies that offer grocery delivery is getting those people to sign up, said Darren Seifer, a food and beverage industry analyst at NPD Group.  \"There are always going to be people who want their bananas a little green,\" he said.  Ade Ogbomo, a teacher in Dallas, said she orders everything from Amazon \u2014 except food.  \"I like to get it myself,\" she said outside a Whole Foods store. She worries about the possible mishaps: \"Maybe the bananas are bruised or the cookies are all broken up, and you can't really complain because you asked for it.\"  Good, though, said she thinks Whole Foods has high-enough quality produce that she's not worried about choosing items herself.  About 7 percent of U.S. households bought groceries online last year, according to NPD Group. Most of those \u2014 about three-quarters \u2014 get their orders delivered to their door; the rest pick it up at the store. NPD Group said it expects online grocery shopping to grow quickly, especially among young adults, who are more comfortable shopping online.  And grocery chains don't want to miss out when that happens.  Walmart, the country's largest grocer, is making it easier for customers to order groceries online and pick them up at the store. Target bought grocery-delivery company Shipt late last year. Kroger, the largest traditional supermarket chain, has been promoting store pickup for online orders and doing trials of home delivery.  Maggie Anderson, 38, a therapist in Cincinnati, said she has tried it at Remke, a regional chain.  \"I just did my first order online at Remke this week because I was of out of town, and that was great,\" she said. \"It saved me a whole hour and a half of time.\"  For Amazon, items will be pulled from Whole Foods stores, bagged and then delivered by Amazon drivers. Amazon, based in Seattle, said there's no extra fee for two-hour deliveries above $35, but one-hour delivery will cost $8. The company isn't saying where delivery will expand, but its Prime Now service is in more than 30 cities, including Chicago, Milwaukee and San Diego.  The announcement gives Amazon yet another way to get groceries to customer's doorsteps.  It already does so through AmazonFresh, but that requires a $15-a-month fee. And Prime Now delivers groceries from its facilities, but it has also offered grocery delivery from other physical stores, including Whole Foods rival Sprouts Farmers Market.  Whole Foods also offers delivery in some cities through a partnership with delivery service Instacart, which will continue.  Buying Whole Foods was the biggest part of a push into physical retail for the chain known for online shopping. Right after taking over Whole Foods, Amazon made a splash by cutting prices on bananas, yogurt and other items. It also began selling Kindle e-readers in some of its 470 stores, and started selling Whole Foods-branded food on its site.  Good's friend Debbie Alf, who picked up some fruit and lunchmeat on Thursday, said she's intrigued by the two-hour delivery pledge. Would she give it a try?  \"Maybe sooner than you think,\" she said. \"If I forgot something, maybe later today.\"  ____  Pisani reported from New York and Sewell reported from Cincinnati.

Amazon is set to enter the Vietnamese market by providing e-commerce services for the Vietnam E-commerce Association (VECOM), which is a group of 140 local online businesses, according to the Nikkei Asian Review.  Amazon will help these companies sell and export their products through its platform, and details of its plans are expected to come at the Vietnam Online Business Forum 2018 on March 14.  Partnering with third-party merchants is likely a precursor to Amazon entering the market with its full slate of offerings. Before launching its full marketplace and warehouse in Australia, Amazon helped Australian third-party sellers make offshore sales, and prior to recent reports that Amazon is looking to launch in Brazil, it ran a marketplace for third-party sales of electronics and appliances. The Seattle-based company may be looking to use its partnership with VECOM as a way of getting its footing in Vietnam and building familiarity with consumers before introducing its full marketplace, Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA), Prime, and more.  This launch in Vietnam suggests that Southeast Asia is a focus for Amazon's international expansion plans. Amazon also launched in Singapore, its first market in Southeast Asia, in July 2017, where it is now operating in full with Prime and Prime Now. These first two forays occurring so close to each other may mean that Amazon has grand plans for the region, which would make sense as Southeast Asia's e-commerce sales are projected to climb to $88 billion by 2025, up from an estimated $11 billion in 2017. The region is particularly valuable to Amazon because the growth of its Prime subscriber base is reportedly slowing, and international markets, especially ones with the potential of Southeast Asia, could provide a significant boost.  Amazon will face stiff competition in Vietnam, and Southeast Asia as a whole, from Alibaba and JD.com. In Vietnam specifically, Lazada, which Alibaba owns 83% of, controls approximately 30% of the country's e-commerce business, according to the Nikkei Asian Review.com. JD.com has shown interest as well, investing approximately $50 million in Tiki, a Vietnam-based online retailer that it intends to help with fulfillment, logistics, and more. The presence of both of these powerful companies will make it difficult for Amazon to succeed in Vietnam, and if the company looks to expand to other markets, like Indonesia, it will find similar situations, often with Alibaba and JD.com having a significant head start.", "stock": "AMZN", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-13", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-to-enter-vietnam-2018-3"}, {"article": "BI Intelligence  This story was delivered to BI Intelligence \"E-Commerce Briefing\" subscribers hours before appearing on Business Insider.

Amazon has been attempting to curb losses on shipping orders of low-priced items by raising shipping fees for consumer goods suppliers, Bloomberg reports.  The e-commerce giant deducts transport costs \u2014 or the cost of moving a supplier's inventory through its distribution network \u2014 from payments for bulk orders from suppliers.  But, as its shipping costs have dramatically increased over the years, Amazon is looking to shift these costs more to its suppliers, and specifically target low-cost items that are heavy and expensive to ship, like beverages and diapers.  Additionally, the e-commerce giant is planning to make it more difficult for shoppers to purchase single, low-priced items, such as toothbrushes or soap, to encourage them to add these items into a larger purchase. Some personal care and health items on Amazon are already restricted as \"add-ons,\" or items that can only be purchased with a basket size of $25 or more. However, the company is planning on designating more items as \"add-ons\" by expanding the category to include health and beauty products that cost less than $7.  Amazon is looking to curb costs because its shipping costs are skyrocketing. Although Amazon has been working to optimize its fulfillment network through various initiatives, like extending order cut-off times to eliminate split shipments, its shipping costs are still growing in the double digits. Shipping costs reached nearly $20 billion in 2017 for the e-commerce titan, growing 31% year-over-year (YoY) in Q4 alone. As Amazon looks to grow its Prime Now, one-hour, and two-hour delivery services, while keeping its reputation for free and fast shipping on all orders, its move to improve profitability on consumer goods products is a sensible one.  The retail giant is following Walmart's move to aim for profitability in shipping online orders. Walmart has already raised prices for some online goods, and recently began to push suppliers to offer more high-priced goods on its e-commerce site. Although these two companies have been in a grid-lock price war, it seems like they've come to a tipping point in terms of shipping costs.  However, each company's approach has different pros and cons, making it unclear which one will be more successful in optimizing online revenues while minimizing shipping costs.", "stock": "AMZN", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-23", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-aims-to-improve-shipping-profitability-2018-3"}, {"article": "Amazon is famous for its aggressive growth.

Software firm Daon has developed software that will allow customers to use Amazon Alexa-enabled devices, like Echo smart speakers, to send and receive peer-to-peer (P2P) transfers with their banks, according to CNET.  The tool would have customers ask Alexa to open Daon, tell the skill to check a balance or send funds, and give a name, at which point the user would be pushed to authenticate biometrically using their phone. Recipients would have to be added as a designated payee option using online or mobile banking in order to prevent fraud. Daon doesn't yet have any partners to launch the service, but is reportedly in talks with various players that could bring the tool to fruition within the next 18 months.  The move comes as the P2P payments space continues to expand, and as banks look to take a further stake in the game. Business Insider Intelligence estimates that mobile P2P volume will hit $336 billion in 2021, up from $19 billion six years earlier. As volume grows, more players are moving into the space, including banks that are part of the Zelle network, and third-party players, like Apple and Google, which are developing their own services.  As banks specifically seek to compete, a voice partnership would be a smart move, since it could give them early entry to a growing market and fast access to a wide swath of potential users. This news comes following rumors about Amazon pushing to partner with a bank to develop a checking-account-like product, which could incorporate technology like Daon's to extend functionality to Alexa products, making it a win-win for both players.  But voice-based P2P could face obstacles that are tough to overcome.  Voice payments are becoming more popular, but they still appeal to just a small share of the population. Last year, 8% of US adults had used voice commands to buy something or send money \u2014 a figure poised to quadruple by 2022, representing massive gains but still keeping adoption at just 31% of the overall population.

Daon's product has tools to counteract that, like authentication and payee designation, but even with bank branding, which might help, it likely won't be enough to overcome all fears. On top of that, these measures detract from the consumer experience by pushing them back to their mobile device to complete the payment. For many users looking for convenience, it might be tough to justify a multi-device payment when they could simply use an existing service via smartphone alone, especially since many of these already have voice integrations through Siri on iPhones, for example.

The phones are usually discounted in exchange for ads to be shown on a user's lockscreen.  Future phones will not come with lock screen Amazon ads, either.  Phones purchased through the program still come pre-loaded with Amazon apps.  Amazon announced on Tuesday that it will remove the ads from the discounted Android phones on its Amazon Prime Exclusive Phones program on Wednesday.  Currently, Android phones on the Amazon Prime Exclusive Phones program display Amazon deals and offers on their lock screens. In exchange, customers get a decent discount on Android phones from well-known manufacturers, provided you're a member of the $99/year Amazon Prime program.  Discounts are always great, but it's a tradeoff that some weren't willing to make.  Previously, getting a phone through the program meant you couldn't customize the background wallpaper of the lock screen. Amazon also said that removing the ads from the lock screen will allow for these phones to support features like facial recognition and fingerprint scanners.  LG  Certain phones, like the LG G6+, are only available on Amazon's Exclusive Phone program. Others, like the Moto G5 Plus and Moto E4 are available from Motorola's online store. Essentially, it means that Amazon Prime members can now buy certain Android phones for a lower cost than almost anywhere else, without the compromise of dealing with Amazon ads on their lock screens.  For example, the Moto G5 Plus costs $200 on Amazon's program, whereas it costs $230 from Motorola's site. And the $500 LG G6+, an Amazon exclusive, is a larger version of the LG G6, which costs $600 or more.  Still, the phones will continue to come pre-loaded with Amazon apps, so you're still buying into the retailer's ecosystem.  As of Tuesday, you have a pretty decent choice of phones from the Amazon Exclusive Phones program. With that said, newer phones models from companies like LG and Moto are expected to be released soon, so it may be wiser to wait for the newer models when they arrive on the Amazon Exclusive Phone program.

Investors cheered the results, sending the company's stock up 6% in after-hours trading.  Amazon's stock jumped more than 6% after the e-commerce giant topped Wall Street's fourth-quarter expectations.  The company reported its holiday-period results on Thursday afternoon. At the time of writing, Amazon's stock was up $85.00 a share, or 6.1%, to $1,475.00.  Here's what the company reported, compared with what analysts polled by Bloomberg had forecast:  Revenue: $60.5 billion; analysts were expecting $59.85 billion.  $60.5 billion; analysts were expecting $59.85 billion.

Without that benefit, the company would have earned $2.15 a share, beating estimates regardless.  Amazon also shared its guidance for the first quarter of 2018:  Revenue (Q1 projected): Between $47.75 billion and $50.75 billion; Wall Street had projected $48.7 billion. Amazon posted $35.7 billion in revenue in the first quarter of 2017.  Between $47.75 billion and $50.75 billion; Wall Street had projected $48.7 billion. Amazon posted $35.7 billion in revenue in the first quarter of 2017. Operating income (Q1 projected): Between $300 million and $1 billion. Amazon posted $1 billion in operating income in the first quarter last year.  The company's results showed once again the strength of AWS \u2014 and its importance to Amazon's bottom line. Revenue from the company's cloud business grew 45% in the fourth quarter from the same period a year earlier.  Meanwhile, AWS's operating income grew by 46%, to $1.4 billion. That means AWS accounted for 73% of the net income Amazon posted for the period.  Amazon gave only scant details about Whole Foods, the grocery chain it bought last year. The internet company's physical stores, which are largely its Whole Foods outlets, collectively brought in $4.5 billion in sales in the holiday quarter.  By comparison, Whole Foods as a standalone company brought in $4.9 billion in sales in its fiscal first quarter of 2017, approximately the same period a year earlier. But the sales results were actually ahead of Amazon's forecasts, Brian Olsavsky, Amazon's chief financial officer, said on a conference call with investors.  For the quarter, Whole Foods posted a small operational loss, thanks to some non-cash charges, Olsavsky said. Whole Foods earned $95 million in its comparable quarter a year earlier.  Amazon is focusing on cutting prices at the grocery chain, even beyond those it rolled out immediately after taking control of Whole Foods last August, Olsavsky said. But its integration of Whole Foods is continuing apace, he suggested.  The company has already placed some of its automated lockers \u2014 which customers can use to pick up products or return products they've ordered online \u2014 in Whole Foods stores. It plans to list Whole Foods products on the Amazon website and to introduce a customer rewards program, Olsavsky said.  \"Well have more later in the year,\" he said. He continued: \"There's much more to come.\"  Some analysts and investors were skeptical about Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods and have been wondering how far along the company is in integrating Whole Foods into the rest of its operations.

Getty/Stephen Brashear  Amazon Go is Amazon's futuristic store that uses cameras and sensors to charge customers for what they take from shelves.

According to a new bit of analysis from Loup Ventures' Andrew Murphy, Amazon could leverage the technology in Amazon Go \u2014 the company's futuristic store that uses sensors, not cashiers, to correctly charge customers for what they take \u2014 in a different way than anticipated.  Instead of simply opening more Amazon Go stores, he thinks the company will instead license the technology to other retailers, which would give Amazon a \"Trojan horse into the brick and mortar retail space.\"  In this way, it would be similar to the infrastructure Amazon built with its cloud-computing platform, AWS, and its third-party marketplace offering, Fulfillment by Amazon.  Amazon is clearly interested in moving into the brick-and-mortar space, and the technology in Amazon Go could be \"a turnkey solution for automated retail,\" Murphy said.  This probably doesn't mean you're going to see the tech in general merchandise competitors like Walmart or Target, but specialty retailers, like Nike, that already sell their goods on Amazon could look to add it to their growing retail presence. It could save on labor costs, or ensure workers focus on customer service instead of rote jobs like cashing out customers.  The race to automate cashiers' jobs as Amazon Go does has the company in the \"pole position\" to cash in on what Murphy says is a $50 billion opportunity for retailers.  The technology could be a strong driver to bring more brands into the fold as the company courts more and higher-end brands to work with.  Amazon partnered with Calvin Klein over the holidays, using its Echo smart speakers in fitting rooms to answer customers' questions or change the lighting.

He reportedly feels that Amazon is not paying its fair share of taxes, and has previously claimed that The Washington Post is being used to cover up Amazon's supposed evasion, as Jeff Bezos runs Amazon and owns the newspaper. President Trump is also unhappy with how he believes Amazon is hurting the retail industry, and brick-and-mortar retailers in particular.  President Trump does not currently have a specific plan to attack Amazon, and one may never comes to pass, but there are several ways he could go about it.  Antitrust regulation: Amazon captures a huge percentage of US e-commerce sales and e-commerce growth, without showing signs of slowing down, which has led many to consider the case that it is a monopoly that should be broken up. Such a case would not be close to a slam dunk, as it's unclear if Amazon is a threat to competition or considered to be one under antitrust laws. But if it was successful, the resulting regulations would alter Amazon significantly.

Federal income taxes: Amazon appears to have paid no federal income taxes in the US in 2017 thanks to various tax credits and breaks, according to the Institute of Taxation and Economic Policy. President Trump could lead the charge on finding ways to increase Amazon's federal tax bill in order to take a bigger piece of its revenue and hinder the company.

President Trump could lead the charge on finding ways to increase Amazon's federal tax bill in order to take a bigger piece of its revenue and hinder the company. Sales taxes:Amazon collects sales tax in jurisdictions where it is required to, but online sales tax laws vary from state-to-state and city-to-city, and this complexity leads to Amazon not having to collect taxes in certain places. Additionally, in many states, Amazon does not collect taxes for sales from its third-party vendors, leaving it up to them. However, many of these merchants are unclear of their responsibilities, and therefore hesitate to charge sales tax. Although some states are looking into the missing taxes, others have yet to make an effort to solve the problem; until every affected state starts cracking down, Amazon's marketplace will continue to have a price advantage over competitors. If President Trump were to make a push for tougher online sales taxes nationwide, it could give him his desired result of a weakened Amazon.  Meanwhile, the company is still selecting the location for its second headquarters, and has fielded bids that could further shield it from taxes. Amazon has received a number of bids that feature tax breaks, the ability to keep its employees' income taxes, and likely much more, all of which would make it easier for Amazon to pay less in taxes. While these deals would be valuable to Amazon, the potentially extreme level of tax immunity they provide may lead to public backlash, which could bring on new regulations and laws that would hurt the company.", "stock": "AMZN", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-29", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-how-president-trump-could-go-after-amazon-2018-3"}, {"article": "Amazon Web Services CEO Andy Jassy Amazon  Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing division of Amazon, saw major gains in fourth quarter 2017 earnings Thursday as the tech giant tighens its lead in the cloud wars.

Walmart is now price matching Amazon on 53% of all online products, according to data from e-commerce analytics firm Profitero, reported on by Retail Dive.  Moreover, Target is matching 37% of its products to Amazon's prices, while Jet.com is matching 35%. But, even with competitors' price-matching attempts, Amazon remains a cost leader, as its prices are 10% lower than all retailers' on average.  Walmart has been pushing to undercut Amazon, and its recent efforts have been a success.  Walmart closed the gap on pricing differences with Amazon by the end of 2017, averaging only .3% higher than Amazon from December 2016 to November 2017, down from 3% higher for the same period in the previous year. The retailer has also been using tactics, such as pickup discounts, to help customers save money on online orders.  Walmart's in-store prices are lower than the e-commerce titan's by 10.4% on average. Noteably, Walmart dominated in home goods and kitchen appliances, undercutting Amazon by 33% and 21%, respectively.  But competing on price may hurt the retailer's efforts to increase margins on online orders. Walmart requested that vendors offer more products priced at $10 or above in an effort to avoid taking a loss on shipping small orders. However, this move may counteract the price-matching efforts it's been making, especially among consumers who aren't brand-loyal, as online shoppers may turn to retailers that have a large assortment of low-priced items to shop from.  Walmart could see more success by offering an array of items under $10, but requiring that they be an \"add-on\" to a larger order. This would allow shoppers to get the low-priced items they're looking for, while increasing margins on shipping online orders for Walmart.  These price wars are likely to have a ripple effect across the entire retail industry, as Amazon ramps up efforts across all segments. Amazon is already stealing apparel sales from retailers, with its pricing and discounts being a major attraction to consumers. Apparel retailers are feeling the effect of this, as they struggle to move inventory and are forced to significantly markdown items. Meanwhile, the grocery segment has been fiercely competing to have the cheapest goods after Amazon entered the space via its acquisition of Whole Foods. But, as Amazon pushes its own brands, it is unlikely that any segment will be immune to the price war.", "stock": "AMZN", "label": -1, "date": "2018-04-06", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/the-retail-price-wars-are-intensifying-2018-4"}, {"article": "BI Intelligence  This story was delivered to BI Intelligence \"E-Commerce Briefing\" subscribers hours before appearing on Business Insider.

Many apparel shoppers are shifting their spending away from retailers like Target and Macy's, and toward Amazon, according to a study from Coresight Research emailed to Business Insider Intelligence.  The study found that Amazon already has a significant presence in apparel, with 46% of respondents saying they made an apparel purchase from the e-tailer in the past year. And that percentage is set to grow, as 48% expect to make an apparel purchase from Amazon in the next year.  Amazon is stealing apparel sales from big-box retailers and department stores alike.  More than 30% of Target shoppers have switched some of their apparel spending to Amazon. This high overlap makes sense because Amazon and Target are top destinations for apparel. However, Target apparel shoppers reported being more likely to shop on Amazon for apparel, and to have a Prime membership, than Walmart's customers. This puts Target and Amazon in direct competition for consumers. But both parties appear to be ready to compete, as they've been beefing up their rosters of private-label apparel brands.

This shows that Amazon is making a dent in department stores' performance, even though it may lack the stores and prestige of its competitors.  Pricing and discounts appear to be a major draw for Amazon in apparel. Forty-nine percent of apparel shoppers said they go to Amazon because it offers good value, displaying that pricing is key for Amazon in the industry. This may hinder Amazon's ability to succeed in luxury fashion, as its low-price image may not be so appealing then, but it appears to be aiding its apparel efforts overall.  Prime subscriptions may be the key for Amazon as it tries to steal customers away.Prime subscribers were much more likely to have shopped for apparel on Amazon, and to plan on doing so going forward, than nonsubscribers. This means that Amazon will have to work as hard as other retailers for non-Prime subscribers, making it even more important for Amazon to grow Prime's subscriber base. However, the number of Prime subscribers who are expecting to shop on Amazon for apparel dipped slightly from the number who made purchases last year, meaning that Amazon may need to evaluate what is causing it to lose apparel customers.

Amazon's checkout-free grocery store opens in Seattle on Monday.  The online retail giant first started testing its grocery store with employees in December 2016, when it also revealed its vision for a store without cashiers.  The store, called Amazon Go, doesn't work like a typical Walmart or supermarket \u2014 instead, it's designed so that shoppers will use an app, also called Amazon Go, to automatically add the products they plan to buy to a digital shopping cart; they can then walk out of the building without waiting in a checkout line.  The store opening Monday is 1,800 square feet, according to Reuters, and it's located in an Amazon office building.  The idea is that Amazon's machine-learning technology can automatically identify when a product is added to your cart, so you don't have to do it yourself. When you leave the store, Amazon automatically charges your Amazon account.  The stores will sell ready-made food, staples like bread and milk, and other grocery products. At 1,800 square feet, the store is relatively small compared with big supermarkets.

Amid President Donald Trump's ongoing public feud with Amazon, CNBC reports that the e-commerce behemoth has been fighting with UPS for the past few years.  The argument seems to be over the United States Postal Service's (USPS) cost structure, which has a direct impact on Amazon, its largest and most highly publicized customer, as well as UPS, which has struggled to lower its prices to match USPS' rates. Amazon's relationship with USPS directly affects the competitive landscape of parcel deliveries in the US, a market in which UPS and FedEx are the dominant players.  The dispute stems from how USPS splits up its fixed costs \u2014 including driver salaries, trucking fees, and other overhead expenses \u2014 between its two business segments. The two units are its letter business, a government-protected monopoly, and the competitive parcel business, which competes with UPS, FedEx, and other parcel delivery companies.  Under the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006, USPS is currently required to cover at least 5.5% of its fixed costs with revenue from its competitive business. Competing logistics providers, however, argue that this low-cost coverage requirement is outdated because of the explosive growth in e-commerce over the last few years \u2014 the competitive business now accounts for 30% of USPS' total revenue, up from only 11% a decade ago.  Last year, UPS argued in a filing with the Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC) that the law gave the postal service an unfair competitive advantage. That's because USPS can cover a large portion of its costs with its letter business, and therefore offer lower prices than other logistics companies.  Amazon routes the majority of its deliveries through USPS as a result of these lower rates, meaning UPS and other logistics providers are losing out on a plethora of business. Moreover, the e-tailer has argued for keeping the requirement as is, saying that a higher minimum would provide no benefits to stakeholders and isn't necessary to create a level playing field. UPS argued in its filing that the postal service's competitive business should cover a much larger share of its fixed costs, somewhere around 29%.  Tensions between the e-commerce titan and logistics companies will only intensify as Amazon moves further into the logistics market over the next few years.Amazon's well-publicized ambitions in the logistics space have grown more intense over the last few months, and will likely only continue to become more serious. It launched Fulfillment by Amazon, which allows third-party sellers to store and ship some of their products in the online retailer's proprietary logistics network, way back in 2006, and it now serves millions of retailers around the world.  Last year, the company started trialing Seller Flex in several locations on the West Coast, which took over management of its third-party sellers' deliveries to speed up delivery times and lower costs, and last month, The Wall Street Journal reported that the company is preparing to launch a stand-alone shipping service for any retailer. Amazon still has a long way to go before it even comes close to posing a direct threat to UPS, FedEx, and DHL, but as it continues to make inroads into the logistics space, it's likely that the company will only further inflame these existing tensions.", "stock": "AMZN", "label": 1, "date": "2018-04-09", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-and-ups-were-feuding-before-trump-2018-4"}, {"article": "Former Amazon executive Greg Greeley.

Amazon has been hiring house cleaners because it's testing a new housekeeping service, dubbed Amazon Home Assistants, in its home city of Seattle, Bloomberg reports.  Amazon Home Assistants' workers can help customers with tasks like cleaning, laundry, and more, and the service has been generally well reviewed by customers so far.  Hiring its own employees and creating its own unique service is a new approach for Amazon in the housekeeping space.  Amazon launched Amazon Home Services in 2015, which is a marketplace where independent contractors can offer their services under the Amazon Home Services name. The program now offers services like help with home improvement, technology installations, and house cleaning. Despite the service's expansion to all 50 states, and Amazon's claim in 2016 that the market for home services was worth somewhere between $400 billion and $800 billion, Amazon Home Services' growth has been slow, according to Bloomberg, possibly leading to the new program.  Amazon Home Assistants targets a smaller market than Home Services: US consumers were estimated to have spent $16 billion on housecleaning in 2017 by ServiceMaster Global Holdings Inc., as cited by Bloomberg. By directly employing its workers and having more control over the service, Amazon may find more success with this new offering.  Amazon Home Assistants could tie-in well with Amazon's efforts to improve package delivery security. Amazon recently launched its Amazon Key program, which uses smart technology to enable in-home deliveries even when customers aren't home.  The program aims to provide more secure deliveries, thus giving consumers more reasons to buy from Amazon. Home Assistants could help this secure-delivery initiative in two ways: Users without Amazon Key could authorize the assistants to accept packages, increasing their value and Amazon's delivery performance, or Amazon Key could make it possible for users to let the assistants into their homes without being present, incentivizing them to use Amazon Key.  The service may make consumers comfortable with Amazon having a pronounced presence in their homes, benefiting some of the company's other efforts. The e-commerce titan introduced its answer to Best Buy's Geek Squad last July through Smart Home Services by Amazon, offering consultations on what smart home products are best for consumers' homes as well as installations.  However, some consumers are uncomfortable with Amazon being in their living rooms all the time in the form of smart devices, likely hindering the service's success. With Home Assistants regularly in consumers' houses, they may be more apt to use Home Services and buy Amazon smart products, like the Echo, because Amazon will be a constant presence in their lives. This, in turn, could improve Amazon's standing in the smart home industry.", "stock": "AMZN", "label": 1, "date": "2018-04-03", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-tests-new-play-to-enter-customers-homes-2018-4"}, {"article": "BII  This story was delivered to BI Intelligence IoT Briefing subscribers hours before it appeared on Business Insider.

Amazon's Alexa fund recently participated in a $62 million Series C funding round into 11-year-old smart home device manufacturer Ecobee, according to CNBC. The funding round was led by Energy Impact Partners.  The Toronto-based company primarily makes smart thermostats, but also sells sensor packages that can pair with the thermostats to help users manage hot and cold spots in their homes, and recently announced it will soon sell smart light switches. The Alexa fund, which Amazon launched back in late 2015, invests in third-party hardware companies and help them make their devices compatible with Alexa, or, in some cases, embed Alexa into their devices.  The Alexa fund was also one of the lead investors in the Series B round Ecobee completed back in 2016, and last year the device maker introduced a new thermostat that has Alexa embedded in it. This latest funding round brings the Ecobee's total funding to $146 million. Thomvest and Relay Ventures, two US-based venture firms, joined Amazon in leading the investment.  Amazon's investment comes shortly after it purchased video doorbell makers Ring and Blink, and considered buying smart lock maker August. The e-commerce titan is clearly interested in broadening its footprint in the smart home market, and likely hopes to leverage the immense popularity of its Echo smart speakers to get its users to purchase devices from companies it has acquired or invested in.  Its ongoing support of Ecobee suggests that the company is at least exploring the idea of adding smart thermostats, sensors, and light switches to its own product suite, which would allow it to build a more complete smart home ecosystem around the Echo products.  Ecobee's primary competitor in the smart thermostat space is Alphabet-owned Nest, and given that Amazon decided to stop selling Nest products through its marketplace last week, it will likely target Ecobee's devices at customers on its e-commerce site who otherwise might have purchased Nest products. Amazon may eventually look to purchase Ecobee outright the way it did with Blink and Ring, though it's unclear whether the younger firm is looking to sell.  Amazon, however, still faces an uphill battle in a fragmented market long plagued by slow growth. The company likely hopes that it can convince its loyalists and other mass-market consumers to buy smart home devices, ultimately growing the overall market. But the consumer IoT space has seen slow adoption, and many companies are struggling to turn a profit.  Meanwhile, Amazon will need to confront a fragmented market with legacy home device makers like GE and Honeywell, as well as Nest, which now has its own long line of smart home devices along with its flagship thermostats.  Amazon may struggle to turn a profit in this difficult market, but the company takes heavy losses in many other business segments, and likely finds the data it could collect on consumers' habits through its smart home devices an enticing incentive to compete. That data could be valuable for its core e-commerce business, as well as new initiatives like its recently reported package delivery service.  The US smart home market has still yet to meet the expectations many observers had in the early part of this decade.  The same issues BI Intelligence first identified back in 2015 still plague the space \u2014 persistently high prices, technological fragmentation, and consumers' lack of a perceived benefit from the devices.  But the newfound popularity of smart home voice control has revolutionized smart home ecosystems across the country, and convinces more consumers to equip their homes with smart devices on a daily basis. The Amazon Echo, released in 2014, has become immensely popular and capable, awakening users to the utility of both voice control and smart home devices. This has prompted companies to rush to release competing devices and integrate voice control into their smart home ecosystems.

It helps arrange the transportation of freight across the ocean on cargo ships from Chinese suppliers. It has even taken a more direct role in delivering orders to customers through local couriers.  But Amazon also depends heavily on outside companies to deliver orders. The company\u2019s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, has said Amazon\u2019s business with carriers like UPS and the Postal Service is growing even as the company gets more involved.  Amazon\u2019s own shipping services have given the company a way to keep up with the growth in its business, which is especially helpful during times, like the holidays, when its carrier partners are flooded with packages. Operating its own shipping services could also offer a way to negotiate better prices with outside delivery companies. Shipping costs at Amazon last year rose 34 percent to $21.7 billion, according to Amazon filings.  Steve Gaut, a spokesman for UPS, declined to comment about Amazon\u2019s plans or whether the company\u2019s shipping volume with UPS had changed. He pointed out, however, that UPS reported 8 percent revenue growth and a 4.5 percent increase in package volume in the United States last year.  \u201cUPS continues to support Amazon and all other valued customers,\u201d he said.

Slowly over time, Amazon has added more and more features to the service, but they are still well short of the offerings from established providers like Microsoft.  \u201cI think Amazon is going to find different areas within the logistics and transportation space where it can be maybe more effective or efficient than what FedEx and UPS can do,\u201d Mr. Sebastian said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re trying to establish a full competitor.\u201d", "stock": "AMZN", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-09", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/09/business/amazon-delivery-service.html"}, {"article": "Additionally, in its latest annual report to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Amazon said it paid $957 million in income taxes in 2017. The company previously reported paying $412 million in income taxes in 2016, $273 million in 2015 and $177 million in 2014, according to the commission.  Those totals can include taxes that are paid on state, federal and foreign income \u2014 although the filing does not specifically break down the amounts for each.  An analysis published in February by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy concluded that Amazon did not pay any federal taxes in 2017. It cited the company\u2019s S.E.C. filing in concluding that Amazon took advantage of a variety of tax breaks and credits to avoid paying federal taxes.  Amazon and the Postal Service  Mr. Trump has also previously criticized the relationship between Amazon and the Postal Service. In December, the president denounced the agency on Twitter for losing billions of dollars when it could be \u201ccharging MUCH MORE\u201d to Amazon and other shippers.  It is true the Postal Service has consistently reported net losses for a decade; the last time it reported net income from its operations was the 2006 fiscal year. In the 2017 fiscal year, the agency reported a net loss of $2.7 billion; the previous three years, it incurred losses of nearly twice that amount.  The beginning of the 2018 fiscal year suggested the organization was not turning its fortunes around. In the first quarter, which included the December holiday season that typically brings its strongest earnings of the year, the Postal Service had a net loss of $540 million.  Those losses cannot be attributed to Amazon shipments alone, however, and the president\u2019s Twitter posts have lacked context. Notably, packages and shipping are areas of growth for the Postal Service that have offset its general shortfalls in revenue.

The Postal Service attributes much of its financial woe to a prolonged decline in the volume of marketing mail and first-class mail \u2014 bills, birthday cards and, for example, bridal shower invitations. Its mail business is still its \u201cmain source of revenue and contribution,\u201d the postmaster general, Megan J. Brennan, said in a statement in February.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  In large part because of the internet \u2014 online bill pay, Facebook birthday posts and e-vites \u2014 the volume of first-class mail being sent through the Postal Service has decreased 43 percent since 2001, when it last peaked.  Still, Mr. Trump\u2019s assertion that the Postal Service is leaving money on the table may have some truth to it. A 2017 analysis by Citigroup concluded that the agency was charging below market rates for package delivery.  If that is the case, Amazon, widely believed to be one of the Postal Service\u2019s biggest customers, certainly benefits.  The report estimated that if the agency increased its parcel rates, Amazon\u2019s shipping costs would rise by about $2.6 billion. Some of that money would presumably go to the Postal Service, which in 2014 handled 40 percent of Amazon\u2019s packages, according to one 2015 estimate.  The report also suggested that Amazon\u2019s high shipment volume gives it a greater opportunity to negotiate rates with shippers. Amazon has acknowledged in the past that it has an arrangement with the Postal Service, but it has rejected the idea that its shipments are being subsidized by the agency.  In a 2017 statement, Amazon said that its partnership with the Postal Service was \u201creviewed annually by the Postal Regulatory Commission,\u201d which found its contracts to be profitable.  The Postal Service\u2019s chief financial officer, Joseph Corbett, has also defended the agency\u2019s shipping rates. In a letter in July to The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Corbett wrote that the Postal Service\u2019s \u201ccompetitive package products, including those that we deliver for Amazon,\u201d are legally required to cover the costs incurred.  Amazon and The Washington Post  People close to Mr. Trump say that his disdain for Amazon (and, by association, for Mr. Bezos) is often set off by his anger at negative articles in The Washington Post. On Friday, the newspaper published a report detailing how Mr. Trump\u2019s legal battles have affected his business empire.

The cancellations signal a recalibration for Amazon, which has taken a middle path in output compared to Netflix \u2014 which plans to flood the market with new shows and movies, estimating to spend between $7 billion and $8 billion on original content in 2018 \u2014 and HBO, which has devoted its resources to a few cultural juggernauts like \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and \u201cWestworld.\u201d  Amazon spent an estimated $4.5 billion in 2017 and tried to reach an array of audiences. \u201cJean-Claude Van Johnson\u201d was an action comedy starring Jean-Claude Van Damme as a washed-up version of himself, while \u201cOne Mississippi,\u201d created by Tig Notaro, and \u201cI Love Dick,\u201d by Jill Soloway and Sarah Gubbins, explored sickness, sexuality and gender roles with a frank honesty.

The studio is not abandoning female-led comedies altogether: \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u201d will move forward after winning best television comedy series at the Golden Globes this month; and the studio just inked a two-year deal with Sharon Horgan, the creator of \u201cCatastrophe.\u201d But the move does indicate a scaling back of smaller projects in favor of landing a mainstream hit.

Back in the United States, Walmart, the world\u2019s largest retailer, is testing out the Bossa Nova robots in dozens of its locations to reduce some tedious tasks that can eat up a worker\u2019s time. The robots, which look like giant wheeled luggage bags, roll up and down the aisles looking for shelves where cereal boxes are out of stock and items like toys are mislabeled. The machines then report back to workers, who restock the shelves and apply new labels.  At 120 of Walmart\u2019s 4,700 American stores, shoppers can also scan items, including fruits and vegetables, using the camera on their smartphones and pay for them using the devices. When customers walk out, an employee checks their receipts and does a \u201cspot check\u201d of the items they bought.  Kroger, one of the country\u2019s largest grocery chains, has also been testing a mobile scanning service in its supermarkets, recently announcing that it would expand it to 400 of its more 2,700 stores.  New start-ups are seeking to give retailers the technology to compete with Amazon\u2019s system. One of them, AiFi, is working on cashierless checkout technology that it says will be flexible and affordable enough that mom-and-pop retailers and bigger outlets can use it. In the United States, venture capitalists put $100 million into retail automation start-ups in each of the past two years, up from about $64 million in 2015, according Pitchbook, a financial data firm.

Walmart, the largest private employer in the United States, says that it does not anticipate automation will lead to job losses, but rather that the new technologies are meant to redirect employees to spend more time helping customers find what they need.  \u201cWe see this as helping our associates,\u201d said John Crecelius, vice president of central operations at Walmart. \u201cWe are a people-led business that is technology enabled.\u201d  Some traditional retailers are also skeptical about whether the sort of automation in Amazon Go can move to large stores.

Amazon has been so successful at attracting upper-income consumers that it increasingly needs to go elsewhere in search of growth, analysts said.

But Sucharita Kodali, an analyst at Forrester Research, a market research company, said a recent survey of shoppers by her firm had found that a majority of American households with annual income over $100,000 had Prime accounts. The membership rate falls off quickly farther down the income scale, she said.  There are a number of reasons that low-income consumers have been less avid online shoppers, including the fact that many do not have credit cards. Some may not have secure places to receive packages.  \u201cThey are still getting used to the idea of shopping online,\u201d Ms. Kodali said.  Amazon has tried to address some of these obstacles. Amazon Cash, for example, allows people to add money to their Amazon accounts by taking cash to CVS pharmacies, GameStops and other retail locations. Amazon Lockers, installed outside convenience stores and other locations, give people a secure place to pick up and return Amazon packages.  Amazon said people can sign up for the discounted Prime membership by going to the company\u2019s website and uploading an image of their Medicaid or E.B.T. cards. Like other new Prime subscribers, they can do a free trial of the service for 30 days.  Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank, said Amazon\u2019s move was clearly a grab for a portion of Walmart\u2019s customers.

The e-commerce giant has cut the field of candidates to 20 prime locations to complement its Seattle base, including Atlanta, Dallas and New York. Hundreds of cities hoped Amazon would think outside the box, but a desire for talent and a welcoming environment led it to the usual hot spots.  The company, led by Jeff Bezos, started the process in typically innovative fashion in September by issuing an unusual and very public request for proposals. Fully 238 localities in the United States, Canada and Mexico submitted bids, lured by the prospect of $5 billion in investment and a promised 50,000 jobs with compensation averaging over $100,000 each.  Distressed cities like Detroit and Hartford marshaled civic and business leaders to make their cases, seeing the investment as a chance to transform their economic prospects. New Jersey\u2019s former governor Chris Christie dressed up Newark\u2019s bid with $7 billion in potential tax breaks. The contest even prompted the mayor of Stonecrest, an Atlanta suburb, to rename the town Amazon and make Mr. Bezos mayor for life if he chose the town.  With the exception of Newark, most have come away empty-handed.

Mr. Bezos founded the company there in 1994, and it has since transformed the city, employing more than 40,000 there. That expansion has also contributed to Seattle\u2019s soaring cost of living and its traffic woes.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  To lure applicants, Amazon showered local politicians with its own data about the effect the company has had on the Seattle economy, and some of the immediate economic benefits its second home would experience \u2014 including $5 billion in construction spending.  It asked candidates to include in their bids a variety of detailed information, including potential building sites, crime and traffic stats and nearby recreational opportunities. Amazon also asked cities and states to describe the tax incentives available to offset its costs for building and operating its second headquarters. The most eye-popping of those offers was New Jersey\u2019s promise of up to $7 billion in tax incentives to bring Amazon to Newark.  Another tech giant, Apple, this week said it, too, was hunting for a location to build a major new campus. But the company\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, said it would not conduct a public bidding process akin to Amazon\u2019s. He said California and Texas were unlikely locations for the new campus because Apple already has significant operations there.  Amazon\u2019s search process has also attracted critics. Stacy Mitchell, co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a nonprofit organization that serves as an advocate for local businesses, said that politicians were enhancing Amazon\u2019s image just as the company\u2019s market power was under growing scrutiny from groups like her own.  \u201cAs these cities woo and grovel, they are basically communicating this idea that we should want Amazon to be bigger and more powerful in our economy,\u201d Ms. Mitchell said.  Ed Glaeser, a professor of economics at Harvard who studies cities, predicted that the winner of the contest would have in place the kind of positive economic attributes that mean it wouldn\u2019t necessarily need Amazon to thrive.  \u201cAt its best, the competition for Amazon has spurred cities to think about how to improve their quality of life more generally,\u201d he said. \u201cAt its worst, the competition has become a distraction and a contest for throwing cash at the giant.\u201d", "stock": "AMZN", "label": 1, "date": "2018-01-18", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/18/technology/amazon-finalists-headquarters.html"}, {"article": "Luke Schoenfelder, chief executive of Latch, a start-up that makes a family of smart locks, said he believed that Amazon would make a more serious effort to enter the home security market and compete against companies like ADT, Comcast and Alarm.com.

The companies declined to say much about their plans. \u201cRing\u2019s home security products and services have delighted customers since Day 1,\u201d Amazon said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to work with this talented team and help them in their mission to keep homes safe and secure.\u201d  Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

We look forward to being a part of the Amazon team as we work toward our vision for safer neighborhoods.\u201d  Ring\u2019s internet doorbells start at $179. People who want to use them to record video must pay for that capability, with plans starting at $3 a month or $30 a year. The company also makes stand-alone security cameras.  Amazon has taken some baby steps into home security. Last year it began selling an indoor security camera of its own design, Amazon Cloud Cam, and in December it acquired Blink, a maker of inexpensive internet security cameras and doorbells.  A service called Amazon Key uses cameras and internet-connected door locks to allow delivery people to drop orders inside customers\u2019 homes.  Google, one of Amazon\u2019s biggest rivals, is also an increasingly important player in home automation and security, with its Nest thermostats and security cameras.  James McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research, said he believed that Amazon had bought Ring so it could add more intelligent capabilities to its doorbells and cameras, like the ability to use software to recognize faces at the front door.

In a business environment that demands, and rewards, quarterly profits and short-term strategic thinking, Amazon showed extraordinary resolve in focusing on long-term goals, somehow persuading investors to go along.  Over its first decade in existence, including long stretches where it consistently reported losses, Amazon enjoyed a luxury afforded few companies: leeway.  \u201cI think it comes down to a consistent message and consistent strategy, one that doesn\u2019t deviate when the stock goes down or goes up,\u201d said Bill Miller, the chief investment officer at Miller Value Partners, whose largest holding is Amazon.  In part, Amazon has inured itself to pressure from Wall Street by ignoring it. While many chief executives devote significant time to fielding questions from investors, Amazon\u2019s founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos, is famously stingy about the time he spends with major stockholders. He hasn\u2019t appeared on an Amazon earnings calls in years.  In a 2014 interview with Business Insider, Mr. Bezos said he spent a measly six hours a year on investor relations and then only with long-term shareholders, who have been willing to weather the company\u2019s ups and downs. Mr. Miller is one of them.  Mr. Bezos has constantly reminded the market of his philosophy. Each year in the company\u2019s annual letter to shareholders, Amazon attaches a copy of the very first letter from 1997, its first as a publicly traded company.  Photo  \u201cWe will continue to make investment decisions in light of long-term market leadership considerations rather than short-term profitability considerations or short-term Wall Street reactions,\u201d Mr. Bezos wrote in a section of the letter titled, \u201cIt\u2019s All About the Long Term.\u2019\u2019  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Mr. Bezos has been true to his word. Amazon has reported an annual profit in only 13 of the 21 years that it has operated as a publicly traded company, according to FactSet, a financial data firm.  And its profit margins, already low by some measures, have fluctuated from year to year \u2014 hardly moving in the straight upward line that Wall Street usually likes to see.  Yet investors have rewarded Amazon for plowing its profits back into growing its businesses, whether in online retail, cloud computing or, most recently, in grocery stores, with the acquisition of Whole Foods Market.  An Amazon spokesman declined to comment.  It may sound like a Pollyanna view of stock investing, particularly in a market increasingly dominated by trading algorithms and macro bets on the direction of interest rates. But in the case of Amazon, it is actually true.  \u201cIf Wall Street would allow more companies to reinvest like Amazon, it would create great benefits for the economy,\u201d said Henry Blodget, a former stock analyst, who first came to prominence in 1998 by setting a $400 price target for Amazon shares. (He is now editorial director of the online publication Business Insider, in which Mr. Bezos was an investor.)  The reality of the economy, however, is that most other companies are still playing by Wall Street\u2019s old rules, which demand consistent profit growth.

Last month, Kimberly-Clark, under pricing pressure from Amazon and Walmart, said it was laying off more than 5,000 workers and closing or selling 10 of its factories.  It wasn\u2019t always so easy for Amazon. During the tech boom of the late 1990s, Amazon was one of a number of promising tech start-ups that were losing money. But it showed the potential for longer term profit, as it moved from selling books into music and toys.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  But like the rest of the tech sector, Amazon\u2019s shares tumbled in 2000 and 2001 as investors began to wonder if these companies could ever make money. A young debt analyst at Lehman Brothers warned in June 2000 that Amazon might soon run out of cash, causing investors to worry about its survival.  Mr. Bezos had squirreled away enough capital to get through those dark days. But it took many years for investors who had been burned by the dot-com crash to give Amazon a second chance.  For long stretches from 2002 to 2006, Amazon\u2019s stock price languished, while it invested in researching and developing new technologies and businesses.  Photo  Mark Mahaney, a tech analyst at RBC Capital Markets, looked at the company\u2019s slipping profit margins during that period and warned investors to stay away.  Mr. Mahaney said he failed to realize \u201cthat all that spending on R.&D. was a bullish sign for the future.\u201d He has had a buy rating on the company for more than a decade.  Those long-term investments, which Amazon didn\u2019t detail at the time, eventually gave rise to some of the company\u2019s most profitable businesses, like its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services.  The success of the cloud computing business proved a tipping point. If investors allowed Amazon to spend time and money investing, patience would pay off.  Investors are now awaiting the payoff from Amazon\u2019s foray into groceries with its $13 billion acquisition of Whole Foods last spring. How it plans to integrate hundreds of brick and mortar stores with its core e-commerce business is far from clear.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  By now, Wall Street has been well trained to believe that Amazon has a strategy for Whole Foods and it will take time to carry it out.  \u201cWhat the market finally figured out is Amazon is extremely good at investing those dollars,\u201d said Mr. Miller, the investment officer at Miller Value Partners.  Ultimately, much of the investor confidence in Amazon reflects a belief in its future opportunity \u2014 what investors frequently call a company\u2019s \u201caddressable market.\u201d  For Amazon, the addressable market in retail is roughly $5 trillion in the United States and many times that globally, Mr. Miller said. And that\u2019s not even including the traditional information technology market that Amazon Web Services is attacking. \u201cI asked Jeff what the addressable market is for A.W.S.,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cHe just looked at me and said, \u2018Trillions and trillions.\u2019\u201d  Online spending represents less than 10 percent of total retail spending, and Amazon captures almost half of every dollar spent in online shopping by Americans.  Even Mr. Gillespie, the skeptic, acknowledges that Amazon is \u201coperating extremely well.\u201d But he questions whether years of low interest rates have helped inflate Amazon\u2019s value because investors are so starved for return, they are willing to overlook some of the risks.  Those risks, he said, include regulators deciding the company is growing too large or not paying its fair share in taxes.  \u201cPeople tend to assume away these things,\u201d he said.", "stock": "AMZN", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-04", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/04/technology/amazon-asked-for-patience-remarkably-wall-street-complied.html"}, {"article": "Lindsay Walters, a White House spokeswoman, told reporters on Thursday that \u201cthe president has expressed his concerns with Amazon. We have no actions at this time.\u201d  Still, Mr. Trump\u2019s willingness to again single out Amazon and characterize it as a tax cheat and a job killer is a remarkable use of the presidential bully pulpit that could have serious implications for the company even without any formal moves by the federal government.  His comments have already spooked investors, sending Amazon stocks tumbling Wednesday after an article on the website Axios about his anger toward the company. The stock fell further after his tweet on Thursday, though prices rebounded later.  The tech industry is increasingly on the defensive. Facebook is under attack in Washington for its handling of personal data and the social network\u2019s role in the 2016 election. And the recent death of a pedestrian by a self-driving car has renewed criticism of Uber.  \u201cThe general principle that I know deeply concerns the president is that we need to live in a world where the government sets a level playing field between internet vendors and mom and pop stores,\u201d Kevin Hassett, the chair of the president\u2019s council on economic advisers, said Thursday on Fox Business.  Drew Herdener, an Amazon spokesman, declined to comment.  Several current and former officials said that Mr. Trump regularly conflates Amazon with The Post. Mr. Bezos owns the paper privately, separate from his role at Amazon.  Brad Parscale, the president\u2019s 2020 campaign manager, on Thursday channeled Mr. Trump\u2019s anger about The Post in a tweet of his own, saying: \u201cDo not forget to mention that @amazon has probably 10x the data on every American that @facebook does. All that data and own a political newspaper, The @washingtonpost. Hmm\u2026\u201d  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  And far-right, conspiracy-fanning websites \u2014 some of which Mr. Trump is known to read \u2014 have for months stoked the idea that The Post is in cahoots with the C.I.A. because the agency contracts with Amazon to provide cloud-based data storage. Last November, a headline at one of those sites, Infowars, said: \u201cBEZOS & DEEP STATE UNITE: AMAZON LAUNCHES CLOUD SERVICE FOR CIA.\u201d  The Post declined to comment.  One person close to Mr. Trump, who asked for anonymity to discuss private discussions in the Oval Office, said that the president mused about the issue of Amazon and taxes at least a half-dozen times in the last six months. The president has repeatedly claimed that Amazon costs the Postal Service money even though officials have explained to him that is not the case. Amazon has said that the Postal Regulatory Commission, which oversees the service, has consistently found that its contracts with Amazon are profitable.  People close to Mr. Trump say the president is convinced that Amazon unfairly benefits from tax laws. The internet giant collects sales taxes on its own products in all 45 states that have one, but third-party vendors who sell products on the site often do not collect sales tax, a fact that rivals say is unfair. In addition, some municipalities complain that the company does not collect local taxes.  In April, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in an case on whether to allow states to impose sales taxes on all internet sales. Many observers believe the justices are poised to reverse its 1992 ruling that exempted online retailers with no physical presence in a state.

Mr. Trump hears the sales tax complaints frequently during visits with his wealthy friends at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, and in meetings at the White House, several aides and associates said. One person familiar with his thinking said that the president believes many of his core supporters are hurt when Amazon disrupts the local businesses where they live.  The president\u2019s critique is shared by some of his usual adversaries in the Democratic Party. Like many of Mr. Trump\u2019s wealthy Republican friends, Representative Keith Ellison, Democrat of Minnesota, has been critical of Amazon\u2019s growing power in the marketplace.  \u201cThe Trump administration should rein in giants like Amazon because they have an unfair stranglehold on the competition, not because the president has a personal feud with a company\u2019s C.E.O.,\u201d Mr. Ellison said in a statement on Thursday.  There was also some irony in the criticism coming from Mr. Trump, who has boasted about his dexterity in avoiding paying taxes. \u201cThis is the guy who said that not paying taxes \u2018makes me smart,\u2019\u201d said Matt Gardner, senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a nonpartisan research organization.  How the president could slow Amazon, beyond take to Twitter or complain about the company in speeches, is unclear.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  If Mr. Trump were to pressure the Justice Department to pursue antitrust enforcement action against Amazon, it would be a sharp break from tradition, experts say, because the White House has kept a far distance from those cases for decades.  \u201cIt would be a gross violation and abuse of our due process,\u201d said Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute.  But the president has repeatedly crossed lines that his predecessors have observed. In the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, he has pressured Justice Department officials to investigate his Democratic rivals and to abandon the investigation of himself and his associates.  AT&T and Time Warner have suggested Mr. Trump played a role in the Justice Department\u2019s decision to block the companies\u2019 $85.4 billion media merger. Makan Delrahim, the head of antitrust at the Justice Department, has said under oath in Congress that he would not allow the White House to impact his decisions over that merger or any other cases.  Mr. Trump also surprised antitrust experts with his swift decision to block Broadcom\u2019s merger with Qualcomm earlier this month, after a review by a government panel on foreign investments. The president has direct authority to block a merger with foreign companies that pose national security concerns.  Amazon has tried, through lobbyists and outside consultants, to meet with administration officials and members of Congress to counter arguments about the company\u2019s tax collection and its relationship with the Postal Service.  The size of company\u2019s lobbying staff has ballooned in recent years, according to public filings, focusing largely on drones, transportation, taxes and cybersecurity. It has hired antitrust consultants over the past year.  In 2015, shortly after Mr. Trump started his attacks against the company, Mr. Bezos joked on Twitter about sending the candidate into space on a rocket made by Blue Origin, a space exploration start-up Mr. Bezos owns.  But when Mr. Trump became the Republican nominee and then president, Mr. Bezos and Amazon stopped responding to his attacks, seeing little upside in a public quarrel with him, according to two people briefed on the decision. The people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the conversations were private, said that these days, Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets were more likely to prompt eye-rolling inside the company than any serious effort at crisis control.", "stock": "AMZN", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-29", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/29/us/politics/trump-amazon-taxes.html"}, {"article": "1 block = $500 million in estimated world-wide 2017 ad revenue $5.3 billion Oath  $40 billion  Facebook  $0.8 billion  Snap  $73 billion  Google  $2.8 billion  Amazon  $2 billion  Twitter  1 block = $500 million in estimated world-wide 2017 ad revenue $40 billion  $73 billion  Google  Facebook  $0.8 billion  Snap  $5.3 billion  Oath  $2.8 billion  Amazon  $2  billion  Twitter  What happens when and if Amazon is not only the biggest online retailer in the U.S., but also one of the biggest physical retailers, with total sales greater than those of Walmart and all the data and technical chops of a Facebook or Google?  How it works  Thousands of brands large and small, selling through Amazon\u2019s Marketplace seller program, are now what drives Amazon\u2019s rapid growth in ad revenue. Jijamas, founded in 2013, wouldn\u2019t exist without Amazon, says Gustavo Sanchez, the brand\u2019s co-founder and chief executive. Jijamas sells one thing: Supersoft, high-end women\u2019s pajamas.  Starting at about $70 a set, they rarely turn up near the top of search results for \u201cpajamas\u201d on Amazon, says Mr. Sanchez, since the site\u2019s algorithm favors cheaper, higher-volume goods. Even its high customer ratings only help Jijamas get so far.  The company\u2019s revenue growth is dependent on Amazon advertising, Mr. Sanchez says.  Advertising on Amazon is much like advertising on Google\u2019s AdWords platform, says Daniel Knijnik, chief executive of Quartile, a small ad agency started last August that focuses solely on Amazon. Most ads appear atop search results for various keywords.  Jijamas, a specialty line of high-end pajamas, depends on Amazon for virtually all its revenue growth. Shown, Gustavo Sanchez, the brand\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, on January 26 in New York City. Photo: Kenneth Bachor/The Wall Street Journal  Advertising plays an important role in Amazon\u2019s lucrative direct-to-consumer marketplace, where Amazon, at added cost, provides warehousing and shipping to third-party sellers. Because advertising allows brands to connect better with Amazon\u2019s shoppers, Mr. Knijnik says, even manufacturers who previously sold wholesale to Amazon are now opening their own \u201cstores\u201d on the site.  For sellers like Mr. Sanchez, advertising on Amazon is a mixed bag. A \u201csponsored\u201d listing is essential for getting products to the top of search results, which is the only surefire way to sell anything on a site that offers millions of different products. But sponsored lists are also another way Amazon skims off his profits.  Amazon wants to deliver everything you want to your doorstep, anywhere in the world. But the e-commerce giant faces several challenges in its pursuit of a global empire. WSJ's Karan Deep Singh breaks down the basics with the help of an Amazon delivery box.  On top of the 15% of an item\u2019s selling price that Mr. Sanchez pays just to list Jijamas on Amazon\u2019s marketplace, and the 5% to 6% he pays to have Amazon warehouse and ship his products, there is now up to 12% going to advertising for every item sold through an ad. This April, Amazon will start charging an additional 2% to list apparel (it hasn\u2019t disclosed why). The net result is that Amazon will take about 35% of the price of each pair of Jijamas sold through its sponsored listings.  If Amazon decides to change its search result ranking algorithms or hike its ad fees, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing I can do about it,\u201d Mr. Sanchez says. Amazon represents 65% of his total sales, he adds; the remainder comes from his own website.  Where it can grow  Amazon is continually building and buying new sources of data on our tastes and consumer behavior, from its acquisition of Whole Foods and the build-out of its cashierless Amazon Go stores to the invasion of its low-cost, voice-powered speakers and the rapid increase in its library of streaming video.  Every time Amazon racks up another percentage point of the $5 trillion U.S. retail pie, another $50 billion in the kind of data that Google and Facebook relied on disappears from their systems. Plus, Amazon understands shoppers in a way Google and Facebook might not.  \u201cAmazon doesn\u2019t just know what you buy, they also know about how you shop,\u201d says Diana Gordon, director of Shop+, the ecommerce-focused arm of WPP-owned ad firm Mindshare. \u201cThey know your browsing behavior, the cadence with which you restock certain types of consumables,\u201d she adds.  Amazon is building out not only its self-service ad business but also the sales team devoted to getting brands on board.  All of this could give Amazon an edge over Google and Facebook, but for it to scale that business, it will have to look beyond ads targeted at consumers who are already shopping on its sites.  For that, Amazon has a web-spanning advertising network just like Google\u2019s and Facebook\u2019s\u2014which is the reason a vacuum cleaner you once almost bought can haunt you for weeks on random websites. The Amazon Advertising Platform lets advertisers manage ad buys across multiple advertising exchanges, and it has quietly become as familiar to marketers as its equivalent from Google-owned DoubleClick.  Amazon is building out not only its self-service ad business but also the sales team charged with getting more brands on board. Shown, Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos in May. Photo: April Greer/The Washington Post/Getty Images  Amazon also needs to expand the number of places it can sell advertisements, which is one reason the company bought videogame-streaming behemoth Twitch and is investing so heavily in its own streaming-video offerings.  The company has been creative about where it places ads\u2014ever notice a movie ad on the side of an Amazon box shipped to your house?

AMZN -1.22% has tapped NBC Entertainment President Jennifer Salke to head Amazon Studios, its movie and television unit, succeeding Roy Price, who resigned amid allegations that he engaged in sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior toward a producer.  At Amazon, Ms. Salke, 53 years old, will oversee a deep-pocketed and ambitious online video service with an annual budget of more than $4.5 billion, according to people at the company.  Its best-known television series include \u201cTransparent,\u201d \u201cThe Tick\u201d and \u201cBosch.\u201d Its most successful films have been \u201cThe Big Sick\u201d and Oscar winner \u201cManchester by the Sea.\u201d However Amazon has struggled to find broadly popular hits like HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and Netflix Inc.\u2019s \u201cStranger Things.\u201d  Among the challenges facing Ms. Salke will be improving relations with the creative community, some of whom criticized the way Amazon operated during Mr. Price\u2019s seven-year tenure. Several producers expressed frustration at what they called creative interference by Amazon executives, often leading to production delays and greater expenses. David E. Kelley, who created the legal drama \u201cGoliath\u201d for Amazon, told The Wall Street Journal last fall that the company is \u201cin way over their heads.\u201d  \u201cWhat stood out about Jen was the deep relationships she has nurtured with creators and talent over her career,\u201d Jeffrey Blackburn, the Seattle-based Amazon executive to whom Ms. Salke will report, said in a statement. \u201cShe\u2019s built an impeccable reputation as a big leader who emphasizes creativity, collaboration, and teamwork.\u201d  Since Mr. Price left in October, Amazon Studios has been overseen by Chief Operating Officer Albert Cheng, whose background is primarily in technology and digital media.  Related Video Amazon wants to deliver everything you want to your doorstep, anywhere in the world. But the e-commerce giant faces several challenges in its pursuit of a global empire. WSJ's Karan Deep Singh breaks down the basics with the help of an Amazon delivery box.  Shortly after Mr. Price stepped down, his lawyer, Eric George, said the executive had never been accused of sexual harassment \u201cwith the sole exception of the incident alleged by [the producer], the portrayal of which he vigorously contests.\u201d  The hiring of Ms. Salke, who has run NBC\u2019s prime-time entertainment since 2011, comes after a very public and drawn-out search for Mr. Price\u2019s successor. A leading candidate, Fox Television Group Chairman and Chief Executive Dana Walden, took herself out of consideration early on; another candidate\u2014A&E Networks Group Chief Executive Nancy Dubuc\u2014was also in the running. Fox\u2019s parent, 21st Century Fox Inc., shares common ownership with News Corp., which owns The Wall Street Journal.  In a statement, Ms. Salke said Amazon has \u201cinnovated, disrupted, and created characters that are already an indelible part of pop-culture.\u201d  One of Ms. Salke\u2019s biggest tasks will be overseeing Amazon\u2019s production of \u201cLord of the Rings,\u201d an ambitious and expensive series based on J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s popular fantasy novels. Amazon won a bidding war for the rights to the series, which was given a multi-season commitment.  Ms. Salke has a solid track record as a television development executive. Shows developed on her watch at NBC include the drama \u201cThis Is Us\u201d and the comedy \u201cThe Good Place.\u201d She also oversees Universal Television, the production studio at NBCUniversal which produces shows for NBC and other networks and services. NBCUniversal is a unit of Comcast Corp.  However, Ms. Salke has no experience running a world-wide digital business or in movies, both of which she will oversee in her new post. Amazon is taking a bet that she can successfully handle those new responsibilities.  Prior to joining NBC, Ms. Salke was a television-studio executive at 21st Century Fox. She started her career at Aaron Spelling Productions.  No successor for Ms. Salke was named by NBC Entertainment Chairman Robert Greenblatt. Other senior entertainment executives who will likely be under consideration include Pearlena Igbokwe, who is president of Universal Television, and NBC programming executives Bruce Evans and Lisa Katz.

With a foray into financial services, Amazon would have a chance to become an even bigger part of Americans\u2019 lives. Photo: lindsey wasson/Reuters  Amazon.com Inc. AMZN -1.22% is in talks with big banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. about building a checking-account-like product the online retailer could offer its customers, according to people familiar with the matter.  The effort is still in its early stages and may not come to fruition, the people said. The talks with financial firms are focused on creating a product that would appeal to younger customers and those without bank accounts. Whatever its final form, the initiative wouldn\u2019t involve Amazon becoming a bank, the people said.  If the product emerges, it would further inject Amazon into the lives of those who shop on its website and at its Whole Foods grocery stores, read on its Kindles, watch its streaming video and chat with Alexa, its digital assistant. Offering a product that is similar to an own-branded bank account could help reduce fees Amazon pays to financial firms and provide it with valuable data on customers\u2019 income and spending habits.  The company\u2019s latest push also answers a question that bank executives have been asking with increasing worry: When will Amazon show up on their turf?  With millions of customers, troves of data, access to cheap capital and seemingly unlimited leeway from its investors to enter new businesses, Amazon is a fearsome competitor. Its more-than $700 billion market value eclipses the combined value of JPMorgan and Bank of America Corp , the two biggest U.S. banks.  Already, Amazon is building a delivery service that one day could compete with United Parcel Service Inc. and FedEx Corp. , targeting the hospital-supplies market and considering a push into prescription drugs. Shares of companies in those industries have fallen sharply on news of Amazon\u2019s entry.  In banking, however, Amazon appears to be arriving more as a partner than a disrupter.  Last fall, it put out a request for proposals from several banks for a hybrid-type checking account and is weighing pitches from firms including JPMorgan and Capital One Financial Corp. , some of the people said. It is too early to say exactly what the product will look like, including whether it would give customers the ability to write checks, directly pay bills, or access to a nationwide ATM network.  Amazon\u2019s collaborative approach supports what bank executives have long said: that new regulations put in place after the financial crisis, while bad for profitability, are a protective moat against challengers.

WSJ's Karan Deep Singh breaks down the basics with the help of an Amazon delivery box.  Any move by Amazon to start its own banking arm would subject it to capital rules and other regulations that likely would limit its aggressive expansion. And there would likely be stiff opposition. An effort by Walmart Inc. more than a decade ago to obtain a type of banking license withered after intense criticism from a range of companies and lawmakers.  For JPMorgan or Capital One, winning the assignment would be a chance to keep a potential competitor close and strengthen ties to a company that is popular among millennials, whose financial habits are changing quickly. In a recent poll of 1,000 Amazon customers conducted by LendEDU, an online student-loan marketplace, 38% said they would trust Amazon to handle their finances equally as they would a traditional bank.  JPMorgan is already close to Amazon. It has issued Amazon-branded credit cards since 2002, and the two companies are teaming up along with Berkshire Hathaway Inc. on an initiative to tackle rising health-care costs for their employees.  Amazon, led by CEO Jeff Bezos, last fall put out a request for proposals from several banks for a hybrid-type checking account. Photo: Mike Kane/Bloomberg News  JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer James Dimon has said he nearly joined Amazon as an executive in the 1990s. He remains an admirer of the company\u2019s CEO, Jeff Bezos, whom he called a \u201cfriend of the family\u201d at an investor presentation last week.  Capital One, meanwhile, is one of the largest bank users of Amazon\u2019s cloud-computing business.  Amazon has been considering a bigger push into finance for years, looking to reduce the fees it pays banks and payments processors, people familiar with the matter said. Providing Amazon customers with a checking account from which they could directly withdraw cash for purchases could help to reduce some of those fees. But there isn\u2019t much precedent for this type of arrangement. It is much more complicated than, say, a co-branded credit card.  Converting its shoppers into financial account holders could also aid Amazon as it ramps up its efforts in payments, a fragmented segment with no clear winner yet. The company has had limited success in getting its own system, Amazon Pay, accepted at other online merchants.  The company is now trying to bring Amazon Pay to brick-and-mortar stores, according to people familiar with those plans. It is likely to begin with Whole Foods, which Amazon bought last year for roughly $13.5 billion, the people said.  Not yet clear: what Amazon can offer merchants, which already face a number of payment providers jockeying for space at the checkout counter. But shoppers who have an everyday banking relationship with Amazon might be more likely to use Amazon Pay.  Amazon isn\u2019t the first retailer to make a play in financial services. In the early 1980s, Sears Holding Corp. bought brokerage Dean Witter. Critics dubbed the offering \u201csocks and stocks.\u201d Sears divested Dean Witter in the early 1990s.  \u2014AnnaMaria Andriotis  contributed to this article.

Photo: Susana Gonzalez/Bloomberg News  Greg Greeley, one of Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s AMZN -1.22% most-senior and longest-serving executives, is leaving the company to run Airbnb Inc.\u2019s core home-rental business.  Mr. Greeley has overseen Amazon\u2019s Prime membership unit since 2013 and helped to develop the program. An employee since 1999, he was slated to work on integrating natural foods chain Whole Foods into the operations of the Seattle e-commerce giant, according to Amazon.  Airbnb\u2019s Homes business has been overseen by co-founder and chief executive Brian Chesky while he conducted a search for a head of the unit, according to the company. Airbnb said in a statement that it selected Mr. Greeley, who will start March 18, due to his operational experience and customer focus. Donna Boyer, director of product for the Homes unit, left the company in January and Airbnb has seen other high profile departures, including its CFO Laurence Tosi, who stepped down last month.  The Homes unit\u2014which includes the apartment and whole-home rentals for which Airbnb is known\u2014represents nearly all of the San Francisco startup\u2019s $2.57 billion in 2017 revenue.  Last month Airbnb announced a series of sweeping changes to Homes, adding options like hotels, a higher-end tier of homes called Plus, and a loyalty program.  The company is grappling with limited inventory in some of its most popular destinations as well as customer complaints of inconsistent home quality. It also has addressed renters\u2019 claims that hosts had discriminated against them. The company implemented changes in late 2016 to ensure hosts couldn\u2019t discriminate.

Officials from the Fair Trade Commission, Japan\u2019s antitrust watchdog, have visited the headquarters of Amazon Japan to see if any violations of the Antimonopoly Act have taken place, a government official said Thursday.  Amazon is fully cooperating with the commission, an Amazon Japan spokeswoman said, without elaborating.  The official declined to specify why the government was investigating Amazon. But he said that in general, the commission was concerned about cases in which sellers of goods may face harm from spurning the demands of powerful retailers.  The commission was interested in ways powerful online retailers can distort competition, reduce incentives to cut prices elsewhere and gain an advantage over other online shopping mall operators, he added.  Japan accounted for $11.9 billion, or nearly 7%, of Amazon\u2019s $178 billion in global sales in 2017. That made it the third-biggest market for the company after the U.S. and Germany.

As in the U.S., the company\u2019s rapid growth and aggressive pricing has generated wide ripple effects across the Japanese retail industry\u2014to the extent that the Bank of Japan has cited low e-commerce prices as one reason for the nation\u2019s sluggish inflation.  Amazon commanded the biggest portion of Japan\u2019s e-commerce market in 2016, at more than 20%, according to a survey by the Japan External Trade Organization. That scale makes it hard for sellers\u2014already fighting for customers as the population shrinks\u2014to refuse requests from Amazon, government officials have said.  The Japan Fair Trade Commission closed a previous probe of Amazon Japan just nine months ago. The commission said it found Amazon Japan had demanded that suppliers offer Amazon customers prices equal to or less than their prices on other online shopping sites such as those run by Rakuten Inc. or Yahoo Japan Corp.  The commission said the practice could give Amazon Japan the broadest lineup of goods at the lowest prices and hinder competition.  Amazon Japan said at the time that it promised Japanese regulators to stop requiring sellers to match the price offered on other sites. The commission closed its probe in exchange.

Amazon is adding Whole Foods to its one- and two-hour delivery option, Prime Now, in four markets. Photo: Elaine Thompson/Associated Press  Amazon.com Inc. AMZN -1.22% said it would start delivering Whole Foods groceries via its fastest delivery option in four markets, marking the first major integration between its e-commerce operations and its new brick-and-mortar grocery chain.  The online retail giant will add Whole Foods to its one- and two-hour delivery option, Prime Now, in the grocer\u2019s hometown of Austin, Texas, as well as Dallas, Virginia Beach, Va. and Cincinnati, Ohio.  Stephenie Landry, the Amazon vice president who oversees Prime Now, said it plans to expand the effort, but declined to say how quickly. She noted that Prime Now grew to more than 50 global markets in less than three years following its creation.  Amazon\u2019s latest move is one of the first to potentially take aim at major grocers racing to offer deliveries and pickups to better compete with Amazon, along with rival online delivery services like Instacart Inc., which currently delivers from Whole Foods. Grocer stocks were hit hard by the news of Amazon\u2019s decision to purchase Whole Foods last summer, with six major food retailers losing roughly $12 billion in value after the deal\u2019s announcement.  Still, Amazon has struggled in recent years to make its grocery delivery business work. Its grocery delivery arm AmazonFresh was scaled back late last year, ending service in some ZIP Codes. The company\u2019s acquisition of Whole Foods was viewed by some analysts as a way to help address some of those challenges.  Analysts have largely expected Amazon to start offering Whole Foods deliveries since the roughly $13.5 billion deal was announced. Already Amazon pairs with grocer Sprouts Farmers Market Inc. and other outside retailers and restaurants in some markets to offer speedy deliveries.  Amazon wants to deliver everything you want to your doorstep, anywhere in the world. But the e-commerce giant faces several challenges in its pursuit of a global empire. WSJ's Karan Deep Singh breaks down the basics with the help of an Amazon delivery box.  Ms. Landry said those partnerships will continue.  For the new Prime Now deliveries, employees will pick the orders in store from the shelves as they come in. Customers will be able to select from a variety of fresh produce and proteins, and some in-store items won\u2019t be available. Prices may also differ.  Prime Now is available only to the company\u2019s Prime members, who typically pay $99 annually. Two-hour deliveries are free on orders over $35, but tips are suggested for drivers. One-hour delivery costs $7.99.  Amazon has previously lowered prices at Whole Foods and started offering some of the grocer\u2019s private label brands on its website and via Prime Now. It also plans to introduce benefits for members of its Prime program.  Ms. Landry said that Whole Foods and Amazon have been partnering on the Prime Now initiative, allowing Amazon to take advantage of the grocers\u2019 marketing expertise and in-store operations.  \u201cYou\u2019re going to continue to see us doing lots of things together,\u201d she added.  \u2014Heather Haddon contributed to this article  Write to Laura Stevens at laura.stevens@wsj.com", "stock": "AMZN", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-08", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-to-deliver-whole-foods-groceries-1518066000"}, {"article": "Amazon.com Inc. AMZN -1.22% is scheduled to announce its fourth-quarter earnings after the market closes Thursday. Here\u2019s what you need to know:  EARNINGS FORECAST: Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Amazon to earn $1.85 a share, compared with $1.54 a year ago. The company has forecast an operating income range between $300 million and $1.65 billion, compared with income of $1.26 billion a year ago.  REVENUE FORECAST: Quarterly revenue of $59.83 billion is forecast by the analysts, compared with $43.74 billion a year ago. Amazon said it expected sales of between $56 billion and $60.5 billion for the quarter, which includes growth from its acquisition of Whole Foods.  WHAT TO WATCH:  \u2014HOLIDAYS: Amazon lately has been demonstrating a little more fiscal discipline, something that may pay off with record profitability in its all-important fourth quarter. Already, industry numbers are indicating a positive holiday season for retailers as consumers spent more, something that should benefit Amazon, which has a 40%-plus share of online shopping.  \u2014WHOLE FOODS: Amazon acquired Whole Foods in August, and the fourth quarter is the first full quarter of reporting. Amazon has so far added lockers for package pickups and lowered prices. Analysts will expect some evidence of whether it is paying off. For roughly one month in the third quarter, the grocery chain contributed about $1.28 billion in sales and $21 million in operating income.  \u2014HQ2: Executives may provide an update on its search for a second headquarters. The company earlier this month narrowed its list to 20 from 238. The stakes are high: Amazon has said it plans to create about 50,000 jobs and invest $5 billion over nearly 20 years.  \u2014HEALTH CARE: Amazon on Tuesday said it was joining JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. to form a new company focusing on lowering U.S. health-care costs. The companies hope the entire health-care project could at a minimum save them hundreds of millions of dollars, according to a person familiar with the matter. Amazon has more than 300,000 employees in the U.S. after adding Whole Foods, and those benefits are costly. Expect analysts to ask for more clarity on potential cost savings.

But the e-commerce giant faces several challenges in its pursuit of a global empire. WSJ's Karan Deep Singh breaks down the basics with the help of an Amazon delivery box.  Amazon in January told the Boston-based mutual fund that food waste wasn\u2019t material and that the e-commerce giant was already working to reduce it. Amazon said food represented less than 1% of operating expenses and assets last year, allowing it to exclude the proposal under SEC rules.  Grocers, restaurants and food-service companies waste food worth $55 billion a year, according to ReFED, a nonprofit working on food-waste reduction. Food retailers are responsible for food waste worth some $18 billion a year, roughly double the sector\u2019s profit from food sales.  More investors are pushing companies to change food-waste and packaging practices that they see as a potential drag on profits in a low-margin business. Many companies are responding. Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc., Walmart Inc. and other food retailers are working with shareholders who have raised such concerns. Costco Wholesale Corp. , Target Corp. and Chipotle Mexican Grill , Inc. have acknowledged similar investor requests.

The indefatigable CEO stopped appearing personally on Amazon\u2019s quarterly earnings calls years ago, but he had a clear message for investors Thursday when the online retail giant posted record earnings along with a 38% jump in sales for the fourth quarter. Writing of the strong success of his company\u2019s voice-activated digital assistant technology called Alexa, Mr. Bezos noted in the company\u2019s release: \u201cWe don\u2019t see positive surprises of this magnitude very often\u2014expect us to double down.\u201d  It is unlikely that he means just more speakers. Amazon has long been sharply focused on driving growth with little urgency to boost profits. It has been richly rewarded by investors for doing so. Amazon\u2019s market value soared 56% last year, beating all of its Big Tech peers despite their much fatter bottom lines. For example, Facebook generated about 50 cents in operating earnings for every dollar of revenue in 2017; Amazon generated 2.3 cents by the same measure.  It is worth noting that Mr. Bezos\u2019s biggest gambles actually take a while to pay off. It was 13 years ago today that he first announced Amazon Prime, a membership-based shipping service. At the time, it seemed improbable that many people would pay $79 a year to get \u201cHarry Potter\u201d books rushed to their doorstep. But Prime has since become a must-have for more than 90 million members in the U.S. alone, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. It now generates more than $9 billion in subscription fee revenue per year for Amazon and effectively locks in Amazon as the first choice in shopping destinations for its paying members.  It isn\u2019t cheap to maintain, though. Amazon has since sweetened Prime with services like video and music on demand, putting the company into the business of creating new content to keep attracting users.  There seems to be no limit to where Amazon will eventually spread. The company became a major grocer last year with its acquisition of Whole Foods Market and even has been making rumblings about getting into health care of late. The company even noted the contribution of revenue from its budding advertising business on Thursday.  Mr. Bezos\u2019s ambitions have helped make Amazon the world\u2019s fourth most valuable company and himself the world\u2019s wealthiest person. His third decade at the helm has brought no signs of slowing down. Once-skeptical investors may dread the day he does.

AMZN -1.22% integrates the pioneering natural grocer into its retail empire.  More than a dozen executives and senior managers have left since Amazon acquired Whole Foods last year, according to former employees and recruiters steering them to new jobs. People who have left include leaders of the bakery, produce, sustainability and local-foods divisions.  Some veterans have left even though higher-ups asked them to stay. Others say they were pushed out after the deal was announced but before it closed, as Whole Foods sought to tighten command.  Executives from Amazon and Whole Foods said that the two companies share a customer focus, are fitting together well and have made great strides in the merger in a short time. But the exodus has raised concerns among employees and suppliers that the distinctive approach that made Whole Foods a natural and organic powerhouse won\u2019t endure under Amazon\u2019s ownership.  \u201cCulturally it\u2019s been a rough start,\u201d said a procurement veteran who left Whole Foods earlier this year after nearly a decade.

Executive departures are common after mergers. Amazon and Whole Foods have held town halls for store employees to discuss their concerns.  This week, executives invited top suppliers to Whole Foods\u2019 Austin headquarters to discuss their frustration with operational changes, including fee increases that predate the merger. Some suppliers said the additional cost could force them to raise prices or defect to other retailers.  The fee increases are overdue and the changes are providing more consistency for suppliers, a spokeswoman said. Whole Foods leaders at the meeting discussed new merchandising opportunities and growth plans with roughly 200 suppliers, she said.  Some Whole Foods executives are urging their colleagues to be patient. They say Amazon can help the grocer make technology improvements, and new ownership has relieved the company of shareholder pressure to reverse falling sales. Some Whole Foods department managers described Amazon executives as respectful and eager to learn from the grocer\u2019s decades of experience sourcing food and handling produce.  Some Whole Foods employees want Amazon executives to tackle the grocer\u2019s problems more aggressively. Already, Amazon executives have questioned an inventory-management system that has left many Whole Foods stores short of some products, according to a person familiar with the discussions.  But other Whole Foods veterans have been frustrated by what they see as Amazon\u2019s insular culture and penchant for secrecy, according to current and former employees. \u201cThere really hasn\u2019t been very much communication,\u201d one former executive said.  Some cited the two organizations\u2019 fundamental differences on issues such as promoting and grooming talent, and whether to focus more on needs of customers or employees. They have noted pressure to put on a good face for Amazon executives, including among the rank and file during town hall meetings.  Some suppliers said new hires at Whole Foods have been slow to master the chain\u2019s techniques for sourcing and marketing healthful foods. Many executives who have left, meanwhile, are consulting for other natural-food companies and interviewing with other retailers, taking that knowledge to competitors.  \u201cIt makes it really difficult when you lose the institutional knowledge,\u201d said Bill Caskey, co-founder of the food consultancy Pentallect Inc.

REUTERS/Charles Platiau Photo: charles platiau/Reuters  Three technology titans have powered nearly half of the S&P 500\u2019s advance this year, a worrying sign for investors expecting a strengthening economy to lift shares of manufacturers, oil companies and other firms whose fortunes typically improve with growth.  Amazon.com Inc. AMZN -1.22% has accounted for 27% of the broader index\u2019s 1.6% gain through Tuesday, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices\u2019 data. That is followed by Microsoft Corp. MSFT -0.53% , which has contributed 13%, and Netflix Inc. at 8.3%. U.S. stocks fell Wednesday, but Amazon and Netflix extended their 2018 gains, adding to their dominance over the S&P 500.  \u201cWhen you see a Netflix or Amazon leading, it\u2019s not necessarily a great sign of investor confidence, since you know those names can always deliver growth no matter what\u2019s going on,\u201d said Jack Ablin, founding partner and chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors.  Investors have fretted in recent years about the dominance of a single sector or stock in the market, but those fears have generally proved unfounded. Markets continued marching higher even after shares of Apple Inc., which was a driver of the rally, stalled for part of 2016.  The S&P 500 technology sector has driven more than three quarters of the index\u2019s gains, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. The next biggest contributor is the consumer-discretionary sector\u2014which includes tech-focused Amazon and Netflix\u2014with more than a third of the advance.  To some investors, the continued outperformance of technology-oriented companies is surprising. After the tech sector jumped 37% in 2017, nearly doubling the broader S&P 500\u2019s advance, many investors expected the rally to stall or be overtaken by other sectors.  Among those expected to gain were cyclical stocks like commodity producers, manufacturers and banks whose businesses tend to improve as the economy strengthens and prices rise.  Instead, energy shares have extended their rout, even as U.S. crude prices have bounced off their 2014 lows. Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. have together chipped away about 12% from the S&P 500\u2019s year-to-date advance. And industrial firms, which soared after the 2016 presidential election on bets that the Trump administration would pump up infrastructure spending, have lagged behind the S&P 500, as some investors have questioned how the administration will secure funding for its plan.  Other investors predicted bank shares would begin outperforming the broader market again after the passage of the Republican tax overhaul. And those companies have seen a boost: JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp. together have made up 12% of the S&P 500\u2019s 2018 gains, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.  Yet enthusiasm for technology stocks hasn\u2019t tapered off. Roughly a third of global fund managers say they are overweight technology stocks in their portfolios, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey conducted at the start of the month.

Pedestrians walked past an Amazon Go store in Seattle in April 2017. The cashierless convenience store, which had been open only to employees for testing purposes, is scheduled to open to the public on Monday after a yearlong delay. Photo: Elaine Thompson/Associated Press  Nearly a year after it was promised, Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s AMZN -1.22% cashierless convenience store is slated to open to the public on Monday.  The new Amazon Go store, located in the base of Amazon\u2019s main headquarters in Seattle, uses computer vision and machine-learning algorithms to track shoppers and charge them for what they select, thereby eliminating checkout counters.  In an interview last week, Dilip Kumar, vice president of technology for Amazon Go and Amazon Books, said testing with employees has trained the technology to work in the store, an experiment that is part of the company\u2019s broader effort to reinvent how consumers shop.  Mr. Kumar declined to say whether Amazon will expand the Go concept, although he said the company has developed the technology to scale.  From the Archives Amazon unveiled its first small-format grocery store, Amazon Go, on Monday. It\u2019s one of at least three formats of brick-and-mortar food stores the online retail giant is exploring. Photo: Amazon.com Inc. (Originally published Dec. 5, 2016)  Amazon announced the new Go store with fanfare in December 2016, and said it would open to the public in early 2017. The opening was delayed, however, as the technology proved more difficult to master than expected, with glitches occurring when too many people were in the store or were moving too quickly, The Wall Street Journal reported in March 2017.  Amazon didn\u2019t explain the delay at the time. According to Mr. Kumar, while the store was originally expected to quickly open to the public to gain extra traffic needed for testing, the company decided it had enough employees to teach the system instead.  That training helped Amazon Go\u2019s technology better identify objects and follow the different speeds and patterns of shoppers, tasks Mr. Kumar described as particularly challenging in a crowd.  Some people \u201cmove in very unpredictable ways,\u201d Mr. Kumar said. \u201cYou\u2019re always bending down, you\u2019re examining items, you\u2019re picking things up.\u201d  The Go experiment shows how Amazon is trying to transform shopping in physical stores after decades of pioneering retail online. Since 2015, the company also has added more than a dozen Amazon Books stores, which encourage customers to pull out their phones to scan covers for prices.  In August, Amazon completed a $13.5 billion deal to buy grocery chain Whole Foods, adding 470 brick-and-mortar stores to its portfolio overnight.  Amazon Go\u2019s technology uses cameras throughout the store to track shoppers once they are inside, though it doesn\u2019t use facial recognition, Mr. Kumar said. A customer entering the store scans his or her phone and then becomes represented internally as a 3-D object to the system. Cameras also are pointed at the shelves to determine interactions with goods.  Shoppers browse the items at the Amazon Go store in Seattle during its employee-only testing phase. The store uses computer vision and machine-learning algorithms to track shoppers. Photo: Elaine Thompson/Associated Press  Among the challenges for the technology was telling the difference between similar looking products\u2014say containers of vanilla and regular yogurt. Adding to the complexity, when customers pick up products, they usually cover the distinguishing aspects of the label with their hands.  Some store associates are still needed. For example, customers purchasing alcohol must show identification.  Former Amazon executives say it likely would be difficult to scale the system to track people in a bigger store, and that it could take years to make it work in a larger store footprint. Still, they say it may make sense one day for Amazon to try to implement the technology more widely\u2014either via additional Go stores or even in Whole Foods.  Mr. Kumar said there are currently no plans to introduce the technology in Whole Foods. He added, however, that every project should be expandable.  \u201cWe have this unwritten rule that whatever it is you\u2019re building, you have to be able to scale it so that it covers significantly amount of more load than what you would normally ever expect,\u201d Mr. Kumar said.  Amazon wants to deliver everything you want to your doorstep, anywhere in the world. But the e-commerce giant faces several challenges in its pursuit of a global empire.

The partnership will include opening a combined e-commerce fulfillment center in the Tokyo area to deliver groceries to a wider area.  The partnership could boost Wal-Mart \u2019s position in a promising business where Amazon isn\u2019t yet strong. Japanese spent about $19 billion on food deliveries in the year ended March 2017, including orders made in person, over the phone or online, according to Yano Research Institute. That number is growing as more women work and the elderly population rises. Rakuten shares jumped during Tokyo trading Friday when the deal was announced and closed 4.5% higher.  But Wal-Mart faces plenty of other competitors in food delivery, such as stores owned by Seven & I Holdings Co. , the Tokyo-based parent of the 7-Eleven convenience-store chain. Food cooperatives and smaller ventures that target niche markets, such as organic vegetables, are also vying for customers. Wal-Mart and Rakuten said they would offer meal kits, a product already sold by many of their rivals.  In the U.S., Wal-Mart will work with Rakuten\u2019s Canadian unit, Rakuten Kobo, to offer for the first time e-books and audiobooks in the U.S., as the company tries to make walmart.com, a destination for a wider variety of purchases and activities.  The deal \u201cenables us to quickly and efficiently launch a full eBook and audiobook catalog on Walmart.com,\u201d Scott Hilton, chief revenue officer for Wal-Mart \u2019s U.S. e-commerce unit, wrote in a blog post Thursday. The digital books could also be offered in stores.  Amazon, which started as an online bookseller and has grown rapidly into other categories, dominates the U.S. market for e-books and has sold millions of its Kindle e-readers. Kobo sells its own e-reader device, which Wal-Mart will now carry.  Wal-Mart has expanded its U.S. e-commerce sales in recent quarters after rolling out online grocery services and buying a string of online startups, including Jet.com Inc. in 2016, placing the site\u2019s founder Marc Lore at the head of U.S. e-commerce operations.  In Japan, both Rakuten and Wal-Mart are struggling to keep Amazon at bay. In 2016, Japan was the second-largest market outside the U.S. for Amazon, following Germany, with sales of $10.8 billion.  Wal-Mart has moved away from building its own stand-alone e-commerce sites and infrastructure internationally. Two years ago, Wal-Mart sold its Chinese e-commerce business Yihaodian to JD.com Inc. and holds a roughly 10% stake in China\u2019s second-largest e-commerce company after Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.  Wal-Mart and Rakuten declined to disclose the financial terms of the deal. Under pressure from Amazon, Rakuten\u2019s e-commerce profits are stalling despite growing revenue, prompting it to search for new businesses.  Last month, Rakuten said it was applying for spectrum to become Japan\u2019s fourth major cellphone carrier. Overseas, it has bought messaging app Viber and invested in ride-hailing service Lyft Inc.

AMZN -1.22% is best known for transforming the U.S. retail industry, a feat that President Donald Trump has recently attacked.  But the company has quietly been cultivating a major customer in his own backyard: the federal government.  In the past several years, the Seattle-based company has won much of the business to help the government shift computing services from legacy mainframes onto the cloud, a business where Amazon is the world leader.  This extraordinary transformation has included the provision of cloud services across Washington\u2019s bureaucracy, from the Department of Homeland Security to the Smithsonian Institution. It also has made the U.S. government a top Amazon customer.  The company doesn\u2019t release specifics, but GBH Insights, a research firm, predicts that Amazon\u2019s government business will grow to $2.8 billion in 2018 and $4.6 billion in 2019, up from less than $300 million in 2015. Other company analysts say those projections are optimistic, but not implausible.  An even bigger prize looms: Amazon is seeking a 10-year contract with the Department of Defense that could be worth $10 billion.  In Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on Amazon, suggesting the company doesn\u2019t pay its fair share of taxes and has damaged the Post Office, he hasn\u2019t mentioned Amazon\u2019s federal government business.  \u201cAmazon is just not on an even playing field,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Thursday. \u201cThey have a tremendous lobbying effort, in addition to having the Washington Post... What they have is a very uneven playing field. Look at the sales tax situation.\u201d He added, \u201cwe\u2019re going to take a pretty serious look.\u201d  Analysts say they don\u2019t see a reason to doubt Amazon will continue to rise as a major Washington contractor, though the president\u2019s criticisms have whipsawed its stock price and injected uncertainty into the equation.  \u201cThe overriding question is whether there is risk to Amazon because Trump seems to have it in for the company,\u201d said Tom Forte, an analyst at D.A. Davidson & Co.  Mr. Forte added that it would be hard for the administration to shift the government\u2019s business elsewhere because of the small number of competitors and the scale of Amazon\u2019s cloud network\u2014data-storage centers arrayed around the country and the globe that provide greater computing power and redundancy in case of emergency.  White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Wednesday that Mr. Trump is \u201cnot involved in the process\u201d of awarding the Defense Department contract.  Amazon\u2019s competitors have seized the moment to seek to slow the company\u2019s march into government business. Over dinner with Mr. Trump on Tuesday at the White House, Oracle Corp.\u2019s co-CEO, Safra Catz, complained that the Pentagon\u2019s process gives Amazon an advantage.  Amazon\u2019s growing government business coincides with a rapid rise of its presence in Washington. In 2010, the company employed eight lobbyists and spent $2.1 million lobbying federal officials, according to data compiled by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. Last year, Amazon spent $13 million and employed 95 lobbyists. Only six other companies spent more on lobbying in 2017.  Amazon has also mounted an aggressive effort to hire former government officials and executives from the company\u2019s competitors to help it navigate government procurement rules. In 2010, the company hired Teresa Carlson, who led federal sales at Microsoft Corp. Scott Renda joined the company in 2014 from the Obama administration, where he oversaw efforts to develop cloud computing.  Newsletter Sign-up  Amazon\u2019s most important early win was in 2013 with a contract to house data for intelligence agencies, including the Central Intelligence Agency. Amazon fought off a challenge from International Business Machines Corp. to retain the contract.  The intelligence community\u2019s willingness to entrust its closely held data to Amazon was a vital signal to other government agencies. Amid a general enthusiasm for using cloud computing to improve effectiveness, the CIA imprimatur suggested that Amazon Web Services, the cloud-computing division known as AWS, was a safe choice, these observers said.  Later that year, the Interior Department awarded a $10 billion contract to 10 vendors, half of whom partnered with Amazon.  In 2014, Amazon benefited from another Obama-era computing initiative: 18F, a consultancy made up of former Silicon Valley developers, which guides government agencies on software and computing procurement.  One of 18F\u2019s first projects was cloud.gov, which helps government agencies such as the Federal Election Commission move some data into the cloud. The government chose to run Cloud.gov on AWS\u2019 GovCloud service, making it easier for government agencies to purchase other Amazon services.  Related Video Amazon wants to deliver everything you want to your doorstep, anywhere in the world. WSJ's Karan Deep Singh breaks down the basics with the help of an Amazon delivery box.  Over time, Amazon has built up other security approvals from the government that allow it to store increasingly sensitive categories of data. Amazon is the only cloud company that has received approval for the government\u2019s most sensitive information.  Those security approvals have enabled Amazon to lock in an advantage over the competition, analysts say. In January, for instance, the U.S. Transportation Command, which manages transportation for the Pentagon, said it was prepared to award AWS a contract without a competitive bid. The company was the only \u201cresponsible source\u201d for the business, because it had been approved to handle government classifications up to \u201cSecret,\u201d the command said.  Amazon worked with 2,300 government entities in the U.S. and overseas in 2017, up from roughly 100 in 2011, according to data the company provided at a conference for Wall Street analysts.  Government sales have helped propel AWS to become Amazon\u2019s biggest profit source. Last year, the company\u2019s cloud computing business had $4.3 billion in operating income on $17 billion in sales, compared with operating income of $2.8 billion on sales of $106 billion at its North American retail business. Analysts estimate 10% of that comes from government contracts.  GBH Insights says Amazon is likely to win the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of $20 billion in federal cloud computing projects in the next five years. The Washington area is one of the finalists for Amazon\u2019s new \u201csecond headquarters.\u201d  The next big break could come with the Pentagon\u2019s planned $10 billion, 10-year move to the cloud. The proposed contract, called JEDI, would require a cloud infrastructure that could handle unclassified material as well as data classified as secret or top secret, defense department documents said.  Amazon\u2019s competitors worry that the Pentagon will award the contract to a single vendor, rather than multiple providers, which they say is preferable because it would provide needed redundancy in case of outages.  Competitors such as Oracle and Microsoft question the security of Amazon\u2019s cloud architecture. They also argue that Amazon could use its dominance to block other tech companies from winning government business.  A Pentagon spokesman said the department is \u201cconducting a full and open competition\u201d with \u201cno favorites.\u201d  \u2014Peter Nicholas, Gordon Lubold and Rebecca Ballhaus contributed to this article.

The outlook came on the back of the computing services and hardware firm\u2019s first quarterly revenue growth in six years.  \u201cWhile slight growth is a modest positive, we were largely underwhelmed by IBM\u2019s results, and felt the numbers showed IBM has much more work to do to turn the ship around,\u201d Deutsche Bank analyst Sherri Scribner wrote in a client note.  IBM\u2019s 3.6 percent revenue growth came mostly from a 71 percent jump in sales of its new Z14 mainframe, which was launched in September, and a 27 percent growth in its cloud business.  Several analysts pointed to the traditionally cyclical nature of mainframe revenues, which tend to surge for 2-4 quarters after the launch of a new launch before falling off.  But some said the growth since IBM launched its Z14 in September hinted at a different outcome.  Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty said the new mainframe\u2019s heightened focus on security was attracting more new customers and workloads rather than just upgrades at a time when cyberattacks and chip vulnerability are at the top of buyer\u2019s list of concerns.  A growth in the mainframe business might also improve IBM\u2019s margins. The company\u2019s fourth-quarter adjusted gross margins of 49.5 percent fell short of market expectations of 50.8 percent.  IBM has been moving away from its shrinking hardware and software businesses to what it calls \u201cstrategic imperatives,\u201d which includes the contribution of cloud computing \u2013 where companies use a remote network of data centers instead of their own hardware to cut costs.  Strategic Imperatives grew 14 percent in the quarter.  \u201cLooking under the surface, however, it appears that strategic imperatives excluding Systems only grew 6 percent, largely driven by the lack of Cognitive Solutions growth,\u201d Berenberg analyst Josep Bori said.  \u201cThis is clearly not enough to offset the declining core business,\u201d he said.  IBM said it would continue to \u201cmaintain a high level of investment\u201d in 2018 as it boosts its capabilities on cloud, mobile, cybersecurity and data analytics.  \u201cThis quarter was another important step in the right direction with 2018 a major prove me year for IBM to show the turnaround story is viable, which we believe it is, albeit at a snail-like pace,\u201d GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives said.", "stock": "IBM", "label": -1, "date": "2018-01-19", "source": "reuters", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ibm-results-research/ibm-shares-fall-on-soft-profit-outlook-idUSKBN1F81QV"}, {"article": "(Reuters) - Shares in International Business Machines rose nearly 2 percent on Wednesday, helped by a double-notch upgrade for the company from Barclays ahead of fourth-quarter results on Thursday.

Pedestrians pass a video advertisement for IBM at their office in Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S., January 16, 2018. REUTERS/Brian Snyder  Armonk, New York-based IBM on Monday sued its former chief diversity officer, Lindsay-Rae McIntyre, who left for a similar job at Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O). The lawsuit alleges McIntyre violated a one-year non-competition agreement and could disclose IBM\u2019s diversity data and hiring plans.  IBM\u2019s stance puts it at odds with trends in the tech industry and broader corporate world towards sharing diversity success stories and best practices, instead seeming to view diversity as a zero-sum game.  The lawsuit is unusual because IBM is arguing its diversity data and strategy are economically valuable \u201ctrade secrets,\u201d a legal term typically associated with closely guarded formulas like that for Coca-Cola. It appears to be the first company to bring such a lawsuit against a rival over diversity efforts, legal experts said.  IBM cited in its complaint McIntyre\u2019s knowledge and oversight of its plans to hire 50 diverse candidates to executive positions and its development of artificial intelligence-based tools to track the career development of women and minorities at the company.  According to IBM, knowledge of this \u201chighly confidential, proprietary, and competitively sensitive information\u201d would allow Microsoft to compete for the same talent and business from customers that value diversity.  Once synonymous with white men in dark suits, IBM created task forces in 1995 to address the issue and soon greatly increased the diversity of its management.  Y-Vonne Hutchinson, an Oakland, California-based diversity consultant and lawyer who works with the tech industry, said IBM has had a legitimate edge over its industry rivals when it comes to diversity.  IBM\u2019s tools for reaching it diversity goals could qualify as trade secrets if it can show they are valuable to competitors, said Villanova University law professor Michael Risch.  IBM said in a statement that it \u201chas a long history of being recognized for leadership in a diverse and inclusive workplace.\u201d  Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft, which is not named in IBM\u2019s lawsuit, said it had no interest in IBM\u2019s confidential information.  \u2018PUBLIC CONDEMNATION\u2019  Russell Beck, a lawyer specializing in trade secrets law, said he was surprised to see IBM make such nakedly economic arguments about diversity, noting that corporations more typically cast their efforts as benefiting society as a whole.  Most large tech firms have long faced criticism for the lack of diversity of their staffs. IBM took a shot at Microsoft in its lawsuit, noting that the latter company has faced \u201cpublic condemnation and class action litigation\u201d for its struggles to recruit and promote women.  Microsoft is seeking to dismiss as without merit a class action alleging pay and promotion discrimination.  Microsoft and IBM both derive much of their revenue from selling software and cloud computing services to big companies, a number of which have said they seek diversity in their vendors and suppliers.  Other tech companies have previously argued for the confidentiality of diversity information, though more out of fear of public criticism and litigation than competition, said John Cary Sims, a professor at McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento, California.  But more have recently embraced transparency. In 2014, Google released diversity data after previously trying to keep it private. Apple and Microsoft have also made their data public.  Joelle Emerson, a consultant who has advised Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and Airbnb Inc on diversity efforts, criticized IBM\u2019s position.  \u201cIf you truly want to build a better industry, sharing learnings is actually a really helpful part of that,\u201d she said.  \u201cUltimately, a more diverse tech industry benefits every company within that industry.\u201d", "stock": "IBM", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-14", "source": "reuters", "url": "https://ca.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idCAKCN1FY38Z-OCATC"}, {"article": "(Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) sued its former executive Lindsay-Rae McIntyre, who was named Microsoft Corp\u2019s (MSFT.O) new chief diversity officer over the weekend, alleging violation of a one-year non-competitive agreement.

REUTERS/Chris Helgren/File Photo  The global shipping industry has seen little innovation since the container was invented in the 1950s, and cross-border trade still leaves an enormous trail of paperwork and bureaucracy.  Success of the platform, which will be made available to the ocean shipping industry around mid-2018, depends on whether Maersk and IBM can convince shippers, freight forwarders, ocean carriers, ports and customs authorities to sign up.  Blockchain technology powers the digital currency bitcoin and enables data sharing across a network of individual computers.  It will help manage and track tens of millions of shipping containers globally by digitizing the supply chain process from end to end, the companies said.  \u201cThe big thing that is missing from this industry to digitize and unleash the potential of the technology is really to create a form of utility that brings standards across the entire ecosystem,\u201d Maersk\u2019s Chief Commercial Officer Vincent Clerc said in an interview.  A shipment of refrigerated goods from East Africa to Europe can go through nearly 30 people and organizations and involve more than 200 different communications, according to Maersk.

Revenue in the newer businesses \u201cmissed whisper expectations,\u201d which disappointed the most bullish scenarios, he said.  IBM reported fourth-quarter sales of $11.1 billion in \u201cstrategic imperatives\u201d -- those newer products and services in cloud, analytics, security and mobile. While that was up 17 percent from a year earlier, it was just in line with the average estimate and many were hoping for more, Ives said.  IBM shares were down 3.3 percent at 7:16 a.m. in pre-market trading in New York Friday.  Much of the growth fueling IBM\u2019s $22.5 billion in fourth-quarter revenue came from its new mainframe servers. Customers from banks to health-care companies are buying the hardware and accompanying software for their own data centers to run large applications -- from financial transactions to customer billing. That should help keep pumping up revenue over the next couple of quarters, analysts said. But IBM will have to show that gains in its newer software and services will help it keep growing even when the bump from hardware sales fades.  \u201cIt\u2019s possible that organic growth may be back to flat in the second half of this year, once the benefit from the mainframe refresh cycle goes away,\u201d said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Anurag Rana. \u201cIf you exclude the contribution from mainframes, growth would be flat to negative, which is in line with the past few quarters.\u201d  Sales, which increased 3.6 percent in the period, topped the average analyst estimate of $22.06 billion. International Business Machines Corp. had forecast the growth in October. IBM said it took a one-time charge of $5.5 billion as a result of the new U.S. tax law, which weighed on profit. In addition, the company said it expects its tax rate to rise in 2018 as a result of the bill, which includes a lower corporate tax rate offset by a broader tax base and reduced foreign tax credit utilization.  Tax Headwinds  The tax headwinds, combined with the one-time charge, threw \u201cone big wrench in the wheel\u201d and could also be why investors are reacting negatively, said David Holt, an analyst at CFRA Research.  Profit, excluding some items, was $5.18 a share in the quarter. Analysts projected $5.17. IBM fell 1 cent short of the average analyst estimate of $13.81 a share for the full year. Under generally accepted accounting principles, IBM reported a loss for the quarter including the tax charge. The shares fell as much as 4.8 percent to $161 in extended trading.  Over the last six years, Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty assured investors that she would refocus IBM\u2019s business on emerging technologies -- such as cloud and artificial intelligence -- and stem the revenue decline. She shed units, invested in cloud data centers and bought a number of companies to boost sales, bolster technology offerings and add troves of data to help train AI algorithms. But those investments have yet to pay off, and analysts have said that IBM\u2019s turnaround is still in the works.  The shares took a beating last year, after the company missed sales estimates in the first half. The stock then rallied the most since 2009 after the company forecast revenue would increase in the fourth quarter. Analysts have said that shows investors care most about getting back to sales growth. One quarter of expansion doesn\u2019t a successful turnaround make, and it\u2019s now critical for IBM to sustain improving revenue this year.  \u201cRevenue growth has been what investors have been wanting to see,\u201d Holt said. \u201cWhen you pull back the layers, all the segments are churning, and fundamentals are pointing in the right direction.\u201d  The company projected revenue growth in 2018, regardless of currency trends. New Chief Financial Officer Jim Kavanaugh said that will be achieved in part by gains in software-as-a-service as well as IBM\u2019s global business services operations -- an area that has struggled in recent years.  Strategic Imperatives Goal  Rometty had set a goal for IBM to reach $40 billion in strategic imperative revenue this year, which would mean those newer products would make up more than half of the company\u2019s business. Kavanaugh said the company will achieve that goal and continue to increase strategic imperative sales at least at a percentage in the the double digits.  Should IBM increase revenue in global business services as promised by the end of the year, that would reverse continuous declines of more than a year, Holt said. This is an area IBM has invested heavily in to shift the focus and skills of its employees onto projects in digital and cloud-based technologies.  Gross margins were 49.5 percent, missing the average analyst estimate of 50.9 percent, in part because measures to cut expenses took longer to pay off, the company said. While margins improved sequentially as promised, this is the ninth straight quarter that they shrank compared with the same period the prior year. Gross margins will stabilize this year, helped by the expense cutting, higher sales in more profitable products and increased scale on the cloud business, Kavanaugh said. However, currency hedges and plans to continue investing will offset some of that benefit, he said.  Revenue from the systems unit, which houses hardware and operating systems software, grew 32 percent. Typically an area of decline, sales of mainframe servers, as well as accompanying software, helped boost the group.  Sales in the cognitive solutions unit, which houses analytics software and the AI products branded under Watson, grew 2.5 percent to $5.4 billion. Technology services and cloud platforms, the unit that includes IBM\u2019s cloud infrastructure and platform offerings as well as its consulting business, posted a revenue decline of 1.2 percent, in part because some of its legacy software sales with bigger upfront revenue shifted to the cloud.  Last week, IBM named Kavanaugh to be the new CFO, while Martin Schroeter will be taking on a new role as the senior vice president of global markets.

His conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., reported that it cut its stake in Big Blue by 94 percent during the fourth quarter, essentially drawing to a close a rare blemish on his investing record.  The move was disclosed in a regulatory filing Wednesday that also showed Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire increased its investment in Apple Inc., now valued at nearly $28 billion. And it initiated a new holding in Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., worth about $365 million, in the final three months of last year.  IBM was always a curiosity for Buffett followers. He\u2019d spent years telling them that technology companies were outside his area of expertise then plowed more than $10 billion into the company in 2011.  Flawed Valuation  Back then, Buffett\u2019s investment was a huge vote of confidence for the aging computer-services firm and its leadership. But things soon went south. IBM struggled with declining sales, forcing Buffett to defend the pick. For awhile, he even added some to his holdings.  Last year, however, he\u2019d had enough. Just before Berkshire\u2019s annual meeting in May, he acknowledged that his valuation had been flawed and that he\u2019d begun to cut back on the investment.  Buffett had hinted he might sell additional IBM shares before the end of last year. Since some of the stock traded below his purchase price, it would have been advantageous for Berkshire to recognize a loss when tax rates were higher, he said this January. Berkshire\u2019s stake in the company stood at just 2 million shares at the end of December, which have a market value of about $309 million.  Missed Opportunities  The episode has highlighted just how badly Buffett missed opportunities in tech companies that have come to dominate the ranks of the world\u2019s most valuable enterprises. At the annual meeting, he issued a mea culpa, adding that he \u201cblew it\u201d by failing to invest early in Google despite having plenty of chances to learn about and understand its business model.  In a sign of his new thinking, Buffett plowed billions of dollars into Apple starting in 2016. He added more to that investment in the fourth quarter, boosting Berkshire\u2019s total stake in the iPhone maker by 23 percent to about 165 million shares.  While much smaller, Berkshire\u2019s new investment in Teva may capture investor attention. The drugmaker has lost more than two-thirds of its value in the last two years. New Chief Executive Officer Kare Schultz has been making major changes since taking over in November. He\u2019s told investors to brace for an ugly ride that won\u2019t be over this year, and gave a 2018 earnings forecast far below investors\u2019 expectations.  To clean up some of the company\u2019s more than $30 billion in debt, Schultz said he\u2019ll cut about 25 percent of jobs at the company -- a step that past CEOs have been unwilling to take given Teva\u2019s close ties to its home market in Israel. He\u2019s also reorganized the drugmaker\u2019s management, and said it will eliminate some money-losing products.  After Berkshire\u2019s new holding was disclosed, Teva\u2019s American Depository Receipts surged 8 percent.  Some other notable changes to Berkshire\u2019s portfolio:  The stake in Bank of New York Mellon Corp. climbed 21 percent to 60.8 million shares  The holding in Monsanto Co. rose 32 percent to 11.7 million shares  The holding in American Airlines Group Inc. was lowered by 1 million shares to 46 million.  \u2014 With assistance by Drew Armstrong", "stock": "IBM", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-14", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-14/warren-buffett-s-berkshire-cuts-almost-its-entire-stake-in-ibm"}, {"article": "Siemens AG is joining with companies including Airbus SE and IBM to try to counter large-scale hacking attacks that threaten to cost $8 trillion in damage over the next five years.

Last year\u2019s WannaCry ransomware crippled parts of Britain\u2019s National Health Service and infected more than 300,000 computers across 150 countries. The cost of cyber-crime to firms over the next five years could reach $8 trillion, the World Economic Forum said in a report in January.  Signatories of the Munich charter, which also include Allianz AG, Daimler AG, NXP Semiconductors NV, SGS SA and Deutsche Telekom AG, are calling for governments and companies to take responsibility for digital security at the highest levels. They suggest governments set up dedicated ministries devoted to the issue.  Societal Breakdown    Airbus CEO Tom Enders said his company now employs about 1,000 people dealing with a response to cyber attacks, a number he estimates will rise tenfold or more in the next decade, highlighting how the issue is becoming an increasingly central part of large companies\u2019 organisation. New-generation aircraft contain tens of thousands of sensors and are increasingly connected via mobile networks, making the storage and securing of data increasingly complex, he said.  Still, most of of the security breaches that are disclosed via government agencies to companies typically come from the either the U.S. or the U.K., evidence that other European political institutions must do more to collaborate with companies, Enders said.  \u201cWe must not be afraid to share information freely between governments, government agencies and industries,\u201d Enders said.  Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said the issue \u201c\u2018will certainly be a focus\u201d of the country\u2019s Group of Seven presidency this year.  The WEF report made reference to thousands of attacks every month on critical infrastructure, from European aviation systems to U.S. nuclear power stations, and said state-sponsored hackers are attempting to \u201ctrigger a breakdown in the systems that keep societies functioning.\u201d", "stock": "IBM", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-16", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-16/siemens-mounts-plan-for-cyberattack-defense-with-airbus-daimler"}, {"article": "Canada plans to scrap a major IBM federal payroll plan that created chaos for thousands of government workers and will have cost the government almost C$1 billion ($780 million) by the time it\u2019s over.  The Phoenix project was originally chosen by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s Conservative predecessors 10 years ago to centralize the government payroll. International Business Machines Corp. won the contract to install and help run the system, which uses Oracle Corp. software.  It went live in 2016, just months after Trudeau won office. From the beginning, it didn\u2019t work like it was supposed to. Some people were paid too much, others not at all. Those issues snowballed with the deluge of requests to fix incorrect paychecks. The fear of not getting paid still hangs over the country\u2019s more than 260,000 federal public servants. Some put off major financial decisions. Others declined promotions or retirement, fearing any change in their pay could cause more trouble.  Two years later, some employees are still having problems. The latest data showed a backlog of 384,000 cases linked to the program.  IBM said it\u2019s \u201cfulfilling its obligations on the Phoenix contract, and the software is functioning as intended.\u201d The company \u201ccontinues to work in partnership with the government\u2019s efforts to resolve the project\u2019s issues, and remains committed to the project\u2019s overall success,\u201d it said in a statement.  An Oracle representative declined to comment.  Debi Daviau, president of one of the main unions representing government workers, said the blame falls mostly on the senior government officials who ran the project and opened it even though there were glaring warning signs it wasn\u2019t ready. But she also questions why IBM went ahead when it was clear there would be problems, and why the company benefits from a project that never worked as promised.  \u201cThey should have known better,\u201d Daviau said in an interview. When the company\u2019s warnings that more testing was needed went unheeded, IBM didn\u2019t put its foot down and hold up the project until it was ready, she said.  \u201cIBM got into a contract with the government that was very beneficial to IBM, which meant that the contract -- despite non-delivery -- could continue to be extended and IBM could continue to come back to the pot for money,\u201d she said.  Treasury Board President Scott Brison has said IBM has a responsibility to help the government fix the program.  \u201cIBM, as a sophisticated global company, needs to recognize that we as the government of Canada are not just an important client for IBM but there is reputational risk for IBM in not helping us fix this,\u201d Brison said last June during an appearance at the Senate\u2019s finance committee.  The fiasco illustrates how difficult it is to bring governments into the 21st century when it comes to technology, and the risks and limitations faced by companies like IBM, who get a large amount of their business from governments. IBM, based in Armonk, New York, doesn\u2019t disclose how much of its revenue comes from government contracts.  It\u2019s not the first time IBM has been embroiled in a payroll system disaster. The Australian state of Queensland scrapped a similar project after an initial contract went off the rails and ended up costing the government around A$1 billion ($772 million) to fix. A public inquiry mostly blamed government officials, but determined IBM shouldn\u2019t have been chosen for the job. IBM disputed some of the inquiry\u2019s findings in 2013.  Canadian Finance Minister Bill Morneau said Wednesday that the previous government made mistakes in dismissing staff needed to implement Phoenix but that, \u201cit\u2019s not about seeking blame, it\u2019s about trying to get it right.\u201d  Canada announced Tuesday it would start moving away from Phoenix and set aside money to find a new solution. The government will spend C$431 million to keep the program running in the near term, on top of C$460 million already spent to put Phoenix in place and fix the problems it generated.  The project was meant to save costs by firing 1,200 employees handling payroll at various departments around the country and replacing them with about 500 people in a centralized location using Phoenix to handle most of the government\u2019s payroll needs.  An inquiry from Canada\u2019s auditor general, a position similar to the U.S. Government Accountability Office, found many of the new employees were poorly trained and overworked. The software platform itself, a heavily modified version of Oracle\u2019s PeopleSoft program, had yet to be encoded with many of the payroll complexities faced by a massive and diverse public service, such as unique shift rules for Coast Guard officers or prison guards.  Phoenix is a classic example of a government wanting to save money on an expensive new technology project by cutting the number of employees working on it, only to discover later that those people were essential to seeing it through, said Nigel Wallis, a vice president with research firm IDC Canada. Other companies considered the project and decided against bidding because it looked too complex, but IBM went ahead, Wallis said.    \u201cThe promise of short term savings are often illusory,\u201d Wallis said \u201cThat\u2019s a real issue not just for government but also for a lot of large scale technology transformations. You need to approach them with a level of seriousness that I don\u2019t think necessarily was done in this instance.\u201d  Most major technology change-over projects -- for the private and public sectors -- either fail or face significant challenges, according to researcher Standish Group, which tracks thousands of projects every year.  On Wednesday, a New Democratic Party representative stood up in Parliament to ask Trudeau what he was doing for one of her constituents who was out C$40,000.  \u201cWe didn\u2019t create this mess,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cBut we are going to fix it.\u201d  \u2014 With assistance by Josh Wingrove, and Nico Grant", "stock": "IBM", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-01", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-01/canada-to-scrap-ibm-payroll-plan-gone-awry-costing-c-1-billion"}, {"article": "IBM and A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S have started a company that will use new technologies such as blockchain, a digital ledger best known for underpinning bitcoin, to track cargo movements and automate paperwork for shipping across international borders.  Maersk, the Danish conglomerate that owns the world\u2019s largest container shipping line, will be the first to use the new platform, while International Business Machines Corp. will provide the back end and support for the technology. The new company said it expects to sign up large shippers, ports and customs officials for the service, set to become available in the second half of 2018.  The IBM-Maersk joint venture, which will be based in the New York City area, named Michael White, former president of Maersk Line in North America, as chief executive officer. Maersk will own 51 percent of the new company, with the rest of the stake belonging to IBM, the companies said Tuesday in announcing the new venture. The two companies started testing blockchain technology for the cargo supply business in June 2016.  On its first day, the new firm will track 18 percent of ocean containerized trade, White said in a phone interview. It will need merger approval from regulators, he said.  \u201cTechnology is changing everything about our world today, and it\u2019s about time to let it change our business,\u201d White said, adding that the company will also use web-connected devices and newest analytics technologies. \u201cWe think we can lower the cost of global trade.\u201d  Blockchain has become a key bet for IBM as the Armonk, New York-based company seeks to sell more of its software delivered through its cloud server infrastructure.
