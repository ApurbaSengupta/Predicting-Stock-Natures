[{"article": "An obscure, private equity-backed company in Massachusetts is behind the system targeted by a cyberattack that halted electronic communications for the operators thousands of miles of natural gas pipeline in the U.S.  Here are three things to know about Energy Services Group LLC and its business unit Latitude Technologies.  1. Small Company, Big Reach    Though Energy Services Group has between 51 and 200 employees, according to its LinkedIn page, it has more than 300 energy clients serving over 9 million residential, commercial and industrial customers in the U.S., Canada and Japan, including in 22 U.S. states. The company wasn\u2019t ready to make a statement or discuss the details of the service disruption yet, Carla Roddy, marketing director at Energy Services Group, said in a brief interview at the company\u2019s headquarters in Norwell, Massachusetts.  Energy Services unit Latitude Technologies, which provides the communications system hobbled by the cyberattack, is a member of the North American Energy Standards Board, an industry group that helps set standards for the gas and power markets.  Latitude is \u201cvery active in all of our cybersecurity work,\u201d Rae McQuade, the Houston-based board\u2019s president, said by phone Tuesday. The company is \u201cvery well known in the industry, they have a lot of clients, they are very well respected.\u201d  2. Tech Veteran CEO    Energy Services Group\u2019s chief executive officer is Philip Galati, who previously held roles at International Business Machines Corp., Dell Inc. and Trillium Software. Other Energy Services Group executives have experience in the computer software and hardware industries, with stints at companies including Oracle Corp. and Hewlett-Packard.  3. Private Equity Funding    In 2016, the company received an unspecified \u201cgrowth equity investment\u201d from Accel-KKR, a technology-focused private equity firm based in Menlo Park, California. Accel-KKR, founded in 2000 as a partnership between Accel Partners and KKR & Co. but now operating independently, has about $4.3 billion in capital commitments.  \u2014 With assistance by Naureen S Malik, and Brian K Sullivan", "stock": "IBM", "label": 1, "date": "2018-04-03", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-03/ibm-vet-leads-company-behind-pipeline-system-shut-by-web-attack"}, {"article": "Subscribe to the Bloomberg Odd Lots podcast (Pocket Casts)  Subscribe to the Bloomberg Odd Lots podcast (Apple Podcasts)  Every week, hosts Joe Weisenthal and TracyAlloway take you on a not-so-random walk through hot topics in markets, finance and economics.

The service will allow traders to buy or sell large quantities of Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies and will compete with companies that cater to large institutional traders. Block-trading companies have recently popped up in Hong Kong, Australia and other markets to meet demand from hedge funds and similar institutional buyers. One such service, Circle Trade, is already directly moving more than $2 billion a month in crypto assets.  Due to go live at 9:30 a.m. New York time on April 12, the Gemini Block Trading service will electronically broadcast orders to participating market makers simultaneously, the company said in a blog post Monday. Trade information will be published on Gemini\u2019s market data feeds 10 minutes after the transactions are executed.  Exchanges that list contracts in a so-called central limit order book are useful for trades under certain sizes, which is determined by underlying demand -- whether for corn futures or IBM stock. Orders beyond those limits move the market in ways that hurt the trader or signal to others the direction prices are headed.  To avoid that, block trades are employed. A block trade\u2019s size and price are negotiated privately off the exchange and then announced on the market in one fell swoop, often with a time delay to avoid triggering an outside price effect.  Cryptocurrency markets like Gemini, which typically use order-book trading, are joining equity and futures markets in offering blocks.

Shares of the two took a bumpy ride in pre-market trading Thursday, with Reality Shares Nasdaq NexGen Economy ETF, symbol BLCN, surging as much as 24 percent before opening little changed. Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF, ticker BLOK, jumped nearly 20 percent only to barely budge at the open.  The distortion this time, though, reflects the perils of trading in new issues with thin liquidity rather than the crypto mania, according to Josh Lukeman, head of ETF market making in the Americas at Credit Suisse AG. Trading tends to be more volatile before the market opens because of a lack of liquidity, a situation that\u2019s often more pronounced for securities without a long track record, he said.  \u201cThis can create a dislocated market for those who are looking to trade the ETF before the underlying basket is open, often resulting in a poor execution,\u201d he said.  Blockchain Battle ETFs with exposure to blockchain surge in pre-market trading Source: Bloomberg data, normalized  The exchange-traded funds debuted into an auspicious market for all things crypto, with Bitcoin slumping below $10,000 for the first time since Dec. 1 only to storm back by more than $1,600 to end higher. Stocks seen as proxies for the space slumped.  The ETFs rose at least 0.6 percent Wednesday, with flows of a bit more than $2 million each, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Only 608,000 shares changed hands in BLCN, while BLOK saw volume nearly double that.  Shortly before their scheduled debut, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission encouraged the firms behind them to drop \u201cblockchain\u201d from their names. The regulator may have been keen to avoid a repeat of recent incidents where microcaps changed names or reoriented toward crypto and saw their shares surge. Most famously, Long Island Iced Tea Corp. changed its name to Long Blockchain Corp. and saw its stock price almost triple in a day.

Now it\u2019s got a comeback plan, but some investors don\u2019t buy it.  China\u2019s erstwhile tech darling, which lost its perch atop the PC market to HP Inc. in 2017, has shed two-thirds of its value since hitting a 15-year high in 2015. At a two-year earnings multiple of about 10 times, its stock is cheapest among the world\u2019s largest computer makers. Yet all seven analysts ranked best by Bloomberg based on one-year returns urge investors to sell. Their average target puts Lenovo 13 percent below Tuesday\u2019s close.  From money-hemorrhaging businesses to resurgent competition for its cash-cow PC division and a revolving-door executive team, the company that once aspired to Apple and Samsung\u2019s heights seems to have lost its way. Chief Executive Officer Yang Yuanqing\u2019s failed repeatedly to deliver on turnaround deadlines and hasn\u2019t fully articulated a strategy to revive ailing mobile and datacenter arms -- even as local rivals gun for its bread-and-butter Chinese customer base. The company\u2019s even resorted to selling office buildings to prop up the bottom line.  \u201cI just don\u2019t see signs of change,\u201d said Qian Kai, an analyst with CICC who\u2019s covered Lenovo for five years and the third-ranked analyst of 30 in Bloomberg\u2019s Absolute Return Rankings. He lowered his target price to HK$2.60 in February. \u201cLenovo\u2019s been caught in the middle of a very awkward situation where it can neither turn the tables on its home turf nor expand quickly enough in overseas markets.\u201d  It\u2019s a far cry from the days when Lenovo was at the top of its game. Yang took the stage at an 18,000-seat Beijing arena one frigid winter\u2019s evening in 2014 to surprise euphoric employees with news Lenovo had agreed to take over International Business Machine Corp.\u2019s commodity server business for more than $2 billion. That same year, it sealed a deal to buy Motorola Mobility from Google, becoming the world\u2019s No. 3 smartphone label.  That was then. The Moto line has tumbled out of the top ranks, unable to expand its footprint in the U.S. and pummeled by fast-moving rivals in Asia from Oppo to Xiaomi Corp. Liu Chuanzhi, an industry trailblazer who transformed Lenovo into one of China\u2019s most recognizable brands, fell on his sword during this year\u2019s address.  \u201cHow many mistakes have we made? How many mistakes have I myself made?\u201d Liu said in February. \u201cWithout question, today\u2019s Lenovo Group faces severe and acute challenges. The challenge is multi-dimensional and uncertain. It\u2019s an age when innovations in technology and business model are powerful enough to overturn an industry and even social customs.\u201d  Lenovo\u2019s now overhauling its sales channel. It\u2019s re-enlisted Liu Jun -- the architect of the Motorola deal -- to reinvigorate China via new avenues such as e-commerce.  \u201cTurning around the business is still our goal, but we probably need more quarters to deliver that result,\u201d Yang said in an interview in February. \u201cWe are transitioning in emerging markets from Lenovo brand to Motorola brand, it hasn\u2019t gone very well. We need to clear inventory and rebuild the brand.\u201d  Perennial Laggard Lenovo consistently trails its peers on blended price-earnings multiples Source: Bloomberg  It also missed out on \u201cits best shot\u201d to grow its server business, Qian said. At the time the IBM deal was unveiled, Chinese customers were starting to eschew IBM, Oracle and EMC in favor of local names. Many ended up with Huawei or Inspur because Lenovo took eight months to close its acquisition.  Lately, the company\u2019s shown signs of life. It\u2019s expected to return to (meagre) revenue growth this fiscal year after two successive annual declines. But at least one fund manager warns against getting into a PC sector that remains sluggish at best.  \u201cThe industry is unlikely to see hyper-growth in the short run,\u201d said Zhang Haidong, a fund manager with Jinkuang Investment Management who doesn\u2019t own stock in Lenovo. Even \u201cthe smartphone business may not see its next inflection point until 2019.\u201d  Alexander Medd, an analyst with Bucephalus Research who\u2019s been one of Lenovo\u2019s harshest critics, argues the company needs cool products.

They see an opportunity for data technologies to push forward $1.6 trillion in incremental IT investment in 10 years, more than double the $740 billion on average that was added in each of the previous three cycles.  Morgan Stanley noted signs of a scenario \u201cbeginning to play out\u201d in which semiconductors have taken the lead as the best-performing sector in 2017.

Companies use blockchain and other so-called digital ledgers to securely record transactions and process other data over the internet -- a service Google could use, for example, to reassure customers that their information is protected when stored on the giant network of computer servers that power its cloud services.  The Alphabet Inc. unit is developing its own distributed digital ledger that third parties can use to post and verify transactions, one of the people said. Although the timing of any product release is unclear, the company plans to offer this to differentiate its cloud service from rivals. It will also provide a white-label version that other companies can run on their own servers, the person added.  The internet giant has also been acquiring and investing in startups with digital ledger expertise. Many of the deals haven\u2019t been announced, the person said. Still, Alphabet was a leading corporate investor in the field last year, ahead of Citigroup Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., according to research firm CB Insights.  Several people in Google\u2019s infrastructure group, which reports to cloud chief Diane Greene, have been tinkering with blockchain protocols in recent months, according to another person familiar with the company. Other Google insiders said recently that the cloud business is a natural place for blockchain-related services. The people asked not to be identified talking about the subject because the company isn\u2019t ready to make an announcement yet.  \u201cLike many new technologies, we have individuals in various teams exploring potential uses of blockchain but it\u2019s way too early for us to speculate about any possible uses or plans,\u201d a Google spokesman said.  In 2016, Google started a trial for developers testing blockchain services on its cloud. The company is now exploring much more expansive ways to deploy the technology, the people said.  Digital ledgers like blockchain power Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. They are databases that are updated regularly across thousands of computers over the internet. Each entry is confirmed by these machines, which can be part of public networks or run privately by companies. There are different kinds of digital ledgers -- blockchain is only one. Data crunched by this technology range from transactions to supply-chain updates to digital cats.  The technology presents challenges and opportunities for Google. Distributed networks of computers that run digital ledgers can eliminate risks that come with information held centrally by a single company. While Google\u2019s security is strong, it\u2019s one of the largest holders of information in the world. The decentralized approach is also beginning to support new online services that compete with Google.  Still, the company is an internet pioneer and has long experience embracing new and open web standards. To build its ledger, Google has looked at technology from the Hyperledger consortium, but it could opt for another type that may be easier to scale to run millions of transactions, one of the people familiar with the situation said.  \"Any time there\u2019s a paradigm shift like this, there\u2019s an opportunity for new giants to emerge -- but also for incumbents to adopt the new approach,\" said Elad Gil, a startup investor who worked on early mobile projects at Google more than a decade ago.  Sridhar Ramaswamy, Google\u2019s advertising chief, said at a recent conference that his division has a \"small team\" looking at blockchain, but noted the existing core technology can\u2019t handle a lot of transactions quickly. Some marketing firms have started to explore blockchain\u2019s potential to facilitate digital ad buying without using Google and Facebook Inc., the two dominant industry players.  When Alphabet wants to keep up with emerging technology, it often backs startups in the field and makes small acquisitions to recruit talent. GV, Alphabet\u2019s venture capital arm, has invested in wallet service Blockchain Luxembourg, financial transactions network Ripple, cryptocurrency asset management platform LedgerX, international payments provider Veem and the now-defunct Buttercoin, according to CB Insights.  Global Blockchain Spending IBM, Microsoft benefit the most from distributed ledger technology Source: WinterGreen Research Inc.  Among tech giants, IBM and Microsoft Corp. have so far led the charge in offering blockchain-related tools and letting companies tinker with digital ledgers using their cloud services. The market for blockchain products and services may grow from $706 million last year to more than $60 billion in 2024, according to WinterGreen Research. Cloud\u2019s 800-pound gorilla, Amazon.com Inc., helps companies build blockchain applications, and Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg is looking at cryptocurrencies, encryption and other decentralized computing approaches.  A slew of startups are trying to challenge Google\u2019s online dominance by using digital ledgers. Brave is a web browser that competes with Google\u2019s Chrome. Instead of running targeted ads, Brave uses blockchain technology to pay websites when people spend time there. BitClave lets people perform searches online, and get rewarded for seeing ads. Another project, Presearch, is also using blockchain to try to compete with Google\u2019s search engine, according to a white paper by the startup.  \"You\u2019re going to see an unbelievable amount of R&D expenditures go into this,\" said Jeff Richards, a managing partner at venture firm GGV Capital. \"Everybody learned from the internet and mobile that you can\u2019t afford to wait.\"  \u2014 With assistance by Joe Mayes", "stock": "IBM", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-21", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-21/google-is-said-to-work-on-its-own-blockchain-related-technology"}, {"article": "When the U.S. government waves the flag of patriotism and national interest, Broadcom Ltd. tries to wave it even harder.  The company that wants to buy computer-chip maker Qualcomm Inc. got a dose of unwanted news earlier this week. The committee that reviews foreign corporations' acquisitions of American companies wrote an extraordinary letter to Broadcom that said, essentially, that the U.S. government is not inclined to look kindly on a combination of Singapore-based Broadcom and Qualcomm.  Reading between the lines of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., at least some U.S. government officials are worried about the potential for China -- and particularly China's telecom equipment powerhouse Huawei -- to dictate the next generation of mobile internet technology, known as 5G. And the committee is concerned that Broadcom and its cost-cutting reputation won't be a good steward of great American hope Qualcomm, which is expected to play a critical role in the development of 5G and has strong ties to the U.S. government.  The merits of CFIUS's argument are debatable, but it's clear that Broadcom has walked into a political minefield in which the U.S. government's fear of China dominating technology standards is working against it. The company's rebuttal to CFIUS takes all those complicated political ingredients and turns them into clumsy Broadcom Jell-O.  Wrong Direction Broadcom's share price has dipped this year, indicating some investor concerns about the company's proposed Qualcomm takeover Source: Bloomberg  Broadcom pledged in a statement released on Wednesday to \"make the U.S. a global leader in 5G,\" but it was vague about how it would go about it. The company said it would maintain the research-and-development resources that Qualcomm has devoted to 5G and \"focus\" the investment to technologies that \"are essential to the U.S.\" Again, there are few specifics. That fits with Broadcom's inflexibility and vagueness in other aspects of its Qualcomm deal talks, including the uncertainty of antitrust scrutiny.  Broadcom tried to tackle one of the committee's main points by saying the company has a \"proven track record of managing R&D for maximum impact.\" But that's a euphemism for reduced spending, and CFIUS is worried that Broadcom's playbook of slashing spending at companies it acquires would weaken Qualcomm's ability to be on the vanguard of 5G technology. Broadcom most likely couldn't address this point more aggressively because the company is stretching its financial limits in the attempted $100 billion acquisition of Qualcomm and knows it must cut costs to make the deal work.  Broadcom in its letter also pledged to create a $1.5 billion fund to train engineers that would hone America's edge in wireless technology. This has all the hallmarks of companies' typical pledges when they're trying to score political points and perhaps have no plans to follow through.  IBM, also with political goals in mind, announced in late 2016 a $1 billion fund to train American workers in technology areas. If all these announcements come through, America will have the best and most expensive workforce in the world. But they won't. At least Broadcom didn't mention the mysterious $20 billion that President Trump said the company's incorporation in the U.S. would somehow deliver to American cities and workers.  A Penny for Your Thoughts Broadcom gets only a small percentage of its revenue from the U.S. Its 2017 purchase of Brocade will add about $1 billion more in North America revenue. That's still nowhere near $20 billion. Source: Bloomberg  Broadcom also waved its U.S. flag vigorously by saying it's part of the lineage of iconic American technology companies that also includes Hewlett-Packard ... and Brocade (acquired by Broadcom)? Yes, I'm sure every child in Silicon Valley knows the founding history of Broadcom and Brocade. Allow me to suggest substitutions for actually iconic American technology companies: IBM, Apple, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, Google and Facebook.  Maybe Broadcom thinks it can afford to be inept in its dealings with CFIUS because the committee won't matter. In the worst kind of political theater, Broadcom said last year that it planned to shift its official home country from Singapore to the U.S. That pending shift has the advantage of possibly removing CFIUS from the picture because Broadcom won't be a \"foreign\" acquirer anymore.  Broadcom reiterated in its statement on Wednesday that it expects that home country swap to be completed no later than May 6. A Qualcomm shareholder election that is a proxy vote on the Broadcom takeover was delayed until early April because of CFIUS's interest. It's possible Broadcom can string this all this along and hope the apparent antipathy of Qualcomm stockholders toward company management and the board can carry Broadcom to acquisition victory.  Whether this acquisition happens or not, both Qualcomm and Broadcom have been damaged. For Qualcomm, the takeover tussle fueled shareholders who were worried and angry about the company's fights with customers and regulators. Broadcom's acquisition play has exposed the limits of the company's acquire-at-all-costs blueprint and showed the company's tendency to be ham-handed politically when it needs to be adroit.  -- with assistance from Gadfly's Brooke Sutherland  This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.", "stock": "IBM", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-07", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2018-03-07/broadcom-trips-up-in-a-political-minefield-on-qualcomm"}, {"article": "Lenovo Group Ltd. has a serious problem on its hands.  It's a problem that could wipe out this year's earnings and even threaten profits next year and beyond.  Despite spending more than $5 billion in a series of acquisitions four years ago, Lenovo's attempts to bolster its mobile and server businesses haven't amounted to much. Its income statement has shown management's flailing attempts to make good on promises, which included wringing a profit out of its new mobile division within six quarters of purchase, and reaching $5 billion in annual sales from its server (aka enterprise) division.  Chronic Fatigue Lenovo's mobile and server businesses haven't made a profit since acquisitions aimed at bolstering both divisions Source: Lenovo, Bloomberg  But investors focusing on Lenovo's P&L may be missing an iceberg on its balance sheet. Lenovo paid massive premiums for the Motorola Mobility smartphone and IBM server businesses in 2014, and the goodwill section of the balance sheet is where these markups sit. This is common, because buyers usually bid up the value of the assets they're pursuing, and you can think of goodwill as the \"overpaid\" column in the spreadsheet. For Lenovo, the result was a sudden doubling to more than $5.2 billion.  Too Good Lenovo's goodwill ballooned after a series of acquisitions that were supposed to boost revenue and profits in its smaller units Source: Bloomberg  Buying assets and booking goodwill isn't a problem if the new divisions add value, usually through profits, or economies of scale that boost margins or cut costs. With the Motorola and IBM acquisitions, though, that clearly wasn't the case. So it's more likely than not that the current fair value of those units is less than the carrying amount Lenovo ascribes to them.  Breaking It Down Half of Lenovo's goodwill sits in divisions that are chronically unprofitable Source: Lenovo, Bloomberg Gadfly, Bloomberg  I choose these words carefully, because \"more likely than not\" is the term the Financial Accounting Standards Board uses to assess whether a goodwill impairment needs to be made. The IFRS Foundation, which also issues financial reporting guidelines, is a little more blunt in its IAS36 standard:  An asset must not be carried in the financial statements at more than the highest amount to be recovered through its use or sale.  Among the indications of impairment, according to the accounting firm Deloitte LLP, is whether the asset returns \"worse economic performance than expected.\"  There's absolutely no doubt, based on management's previous public statements, that those units bought at a cost of $5 billion are performing worse than expected. What's extraordinary is that after four years Lenovo hasn't recognized such impairment and allows the goodwill to sit on the balance sheet.  Reporting standards only require a test of goodwill to be done annually, so it's reasonable not to see anything announced in the past few quarters. But the company's financial year is coming to an end March 31, so the clock is ticking.  You can understand management's reticence. After a slew of deals in the late 2000s, Acer Inc., a Taiwanese PC maker, clung to inflated goodwill figures despite clear signs that the acquisitions weren't bearing fruit. In the end, it had to conduct an IAS36 impairment test and recognized a NT$9.4 billion ($335 million) writedown, enough to plunge Acer into a record annual loss and spur the ousting of its chairman and CEO.  That impairment was equivalent to about 24 percent of Acer's total intangible assets at the time. For Lenovo, I calculate it would take a mere 10.3 percent writedown to push it into a loss for the current fiscal year -- and that's only for an impairment on goodwill, and only at the mobile and server divisions.

Chinese universities and U.S. technology companies, such as International Business Machines Corp. and Microsoft Corp., are racing to develop quantum computers, a type of processing that\u2019s forecast to be so powerful it can transform how drug-makers, agriculture companies and auto manufacturers discover compounds and materials.  Quantum computing uses the movement of subatomic particles to process data in amounts that modern computers can\u2019t handle. Mostly theoretical now, the technology is expected to be able to perform calculations that make today\u2019s computers look akin to an abacus.  While overall spending by China is unknown, its government is building a $10 billion National Laboratory for Quantum Information Sciences in Hefei, Anhui Province, which is slated to open in 2020. U.S.-funded research in quantum is about $200 million a year, according to a July 2016 government report, and some researchers and companies don\u2019t believe that\u2019s enough.  Quantifying Quantum Computing U.S. and Chinese are in an arms race to patent innovations in computing's next wave Source: Patinformatics  One \u201ckiller app\u201d may be encryption, the code scrambling technology that secures modern global commerce and communications. China, Chinese universities and western financial institutions are rushing to patent more ways to use quantum technology for encryption, a study by research firm Patinformatics found.  \u2018Unhackable System\u2019  \u201cWe\u2019re talking about encrypting data so it can\u2019t be broken, certainly not by a classical computer,\u201d said Tony Trippe, managing director of Dublin, Ohio-based Patinformatics. \u201cIt would be an unhackable system.\u201d  At the same time, it could break encryption that was on a classical computer. \u201cAn organization or a nation that had quantum computer technologies would have a significantly easier time of wreaking havoc on other systems,\u201d he said.  What\u2019s Intellectual Property and Does China Steal It?: QuickTake  U.S. President Donald Trump accused the Chinese government in March of stealing intellectual property by forcing American companies to share their most valuable secrets and sign joint venture agreements with local firms if they want to operate in China, although there are no specific allegations regarding quantum computers.  Peter Navarro, the White House trade adviser, spoke Sunday on NBC\u2019s \"Meet the Press\" about the tariffs before shifting to intellectual property.  \"What is at stake here,\" he said, \"is the industries of the future. Artificial intelligence, robotics, quantum computing. And what\u2019s at stake is not just our economic prosperity. If I may, it\u2019s also our national security. Because many of these industries of the future have profound military implications.\"  China\u2019s Innovation  China has also been aggressive in pushing home-grown innovation as it supports companies in obtaining patents and trademarks around the world, and has increased its research funding. In its annual scorecard, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development called China \u201cthe second largest scientific powerhouse,\u201d behind the U.S.  Read More: Who Is Building Canada\u2019s Quantum Brain Trust?  Technology companies from Microsoft to IBM to Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google view quantum computing as the next revolution.  \u201cOver time, quantum in the field of computation is so important is that it will redefine the category of computers themselves,\u201d said Dario Gil, vice president of IBM\u2019s Artificial Intelligence research. \u201cIt is the future of computing.\u201d  IBM\u2019s inventions may be having the most impact on the nascent field, when judged by the number of times its research has been cited by others in their patent applications. The Armonk, New York-based company already has developed computers being tested by customers, including Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, the Energy Department\u2019s biggest lab, as well as finance companies like JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Barclays Plc, Gil said.  \u2018Tough Problems\u2019  Intel Corp., which started its own program two years ago, said the technology promises to be \u201ctransformational.\u201d  \u201cThere are many tough problems to solve before quantum computing is a commercial reality,\u201d said Jim Clarke, director of quantum hardware at Intel. \u201cSome of these problems involve materials science, quantum chip design and manufacturing -- those are sweet-spot problems for Intel.\u201d  Clarke said Intel is competitive in the number of patents it\u2019s seeking, though many aren\u2019t yet public. Applications are made public after 18 months.  IBM Makes Breakthrough in Race to Commercialize Quantum Computers  While there will still be a place for what\u2019s being called \u201cclassical computers\u201d -- a category that includes modern smartphones and even super computers -- the quantum computers could have \u201can infinite number of applications\u201d in the fields of life sciences, chemistry and agriculture, said IBM\u2019s Gil.  \u2018Patent the Potential\u2019  It\u2019s too early to say which company or country will be the leader in quantum computers, though at this stage it looks like U.S. companies will excel in hardware while Chinese and Japanese ones are focused on the software and applications, Patinformatics\u2019 Trippe said.  \u201cJapanese and Chinese companies aren\u2019t as concerned about building them as they are about how they\u2019ll be used,\u201d Trippe said. \u201cThey\u2019ve started to patent the potential. The next five years are going to be pretty fascinating.\u201d  The U.S. China Economic and Security Review Commission, created by Congress in 2000 to assess national security implications of bilateral trade between the countries, said in its most recent report that China \u201chas closed the technological gap\u201d with the U.S. in quantum information science, a sector Americans have long dominated, \u201cdue to a concerted strategy by the Chinese government and inconsistent and unstable levels of R&D funding and limited government coordination by the United States.\u201d  Quantum Physics  Studies by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Bloomberg have independently shown that China is rising in its overall score for innovation, which includes education, government research and the number of patents. The World Intellectual Property Organization reported March 21 that China is closing in on the U.S. in filing international patent applications.  Quantum physics is one area in which the Chinese government, through its Ministry of Science and Technology, is beefing up its technological prowess, according to a report by the U.S. Trade Representative that laid the groundwork for Trump\u2019s tariff plans. The China Academy of Sciences and Beijing University are among the Chinese research firms seeking more patents on quantum information technology, according to Patinformatics.  The Chinese government invested by giving a lot of money to companies and researchers to \u201creplicate what we did in the U.S. and elsewhere,\u201d said Carl J. Williams, deputy director of the Physical Measurement Laboratory at the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology. \u201cThey\u2019ve come a long ways.\u201d  Encryption Focus  The Chinese researchers are focused on encryption, based on their patent applications. In August 2016, China\u2019s state news agency said the government had launched the world\u2019s first quantum communications satellite, and a year later claimed to have sent the first \u201cunbreakable\u201d code from space.  \u201cThat should be very scary,\u201d said Jonathan Dowling, co-director of Louisiana State University\u2019s Hearne Institute for Theoretical Physics, \u201cat least to the intelligence agencies.\u201d  In the U.S., the Department of Energy, Naval Research Lab and defense contractor Northrop Grumman Corp. are among the government entities or contractors researching quantum computers. Overall, though, the U.S. government has cut back on its own funding of computing and cryptography hardware, Dowling said.  \u2018Considered a Priority\u2019  A July 2016 report by the National Science and Technology Council under former President Barack Obama recommended it be \u201cconsidered a priority for federal coordination and investment.\u201d  In the coming age of quantum, it\u2019s an open question whether federal funding will enable the U.S to maintain the edge it\u2019s had during the PC era and smartphone wars. Scott Crowder, IBM\u2019s chief technology officer for quantum computing, told a House panel in October that \u201cthe U.S. government investment in driving this critical technology is not sufficient to stay competitive.\u201d  LSU\u2019s Dowling said it could mean the U.S. comes out the loser in the quantum race.  \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is a bunch of different things going on at once with no overall organization,\u201d LSU\u2019s Dowling said, \u201cunlike in China, where they are exactly sure what they\u2019re doing.\u201d  \u2014 With assistance by Dina Bass, Jeremy Kahn, and Ian King", "stock": "IBM", "label": 1, "date": "2018-04-09", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-08/forget-the-trade-war-china-wants-to-win-the-computing-arms-race"}, {"article": "BI Intelligence  This story was delivered to BI Intelligence Apps and Platforms Briefing subscribers hours before appearing on Business Insider.

IBM launched Watson Assistant, an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered voice assistant for businesses seeking to infuse voice technology into their products, at its annual Think conference on Tuesday.  IBM will license Watson Assistant to enterprises so they can build personalized, interactive experiences into their own products and services that appeal to their customers.  IBM's announcement follows Amazon's November 2017 launch of Alexa for Business platform, which enables businesses to create their own Alexa skills for both practical and business use cases.  Watson Assistant has a heightened focus on customization and privacy over voice competitors like Google and Amazon, which could make it more likely to win over businesses than Alexa or Google Assistant.  It allows for personalization to help businesses better tailor their voice interactions . Developers can create custom voice activation commands and triggers for Watson Assistant, eliminating the need for a standard universal wake word, such as \"Alexa\" or \"OK Google.\" Additionally, businesses can train their assistants using their own datasets, making it easier to build actions and commands.

This was ahead of analysts' expectations of $22.05 billion.  Yet enthusiasm on Wall Street was muted after it reported a loss of $1.14 per share versus $4.73 earnings per share in same period a year ago. This was likely on account of a one-time tax charge of $5.5 billion related to the GOP's tax reform law.

IBM's results call after U.S. markets closed on Thursday forecast an operating profit of at least $13.80 per share for 2018, compared with $13.80 in 2017 and market expectations of $13.92, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  The outlook came on the back of the computing services and hardware firm's first quarterly revenue growth in six years.  \"While slight growth is a modest positive, we were largely underwhelmed by IBM's results, and felt the numbers showed IBM has much more work to do to turn the ship around,\" Deutsche Bank analyst Sherri Scribner wrote in a client note.  IBM's 3.6 percent revenue growth came mostly from a 71 percent jump in sales of its new Z14 mainframe, which was launched in September, and a 27 percent growth in its cloud business.  Several analysts pointed to the traditionally cyclical nature of mainframe revenues, which tend to surge for 2-4 quarters after the launch of a new launch before falling off.  But some said the growth since IBM launched its Z14 in September hinted at a different outcome.  Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty said the new mainframe's heightened focus on security was attracting more new customers and workloads rather than just upgrades at a time when cyberattacks and chip vulnerability are at the top of buyer's list of concerns.  A growth in the mainframe business might also improve IBM's margins. The company's fourth-quarter adjusted gross margins of 49.5 percent fell short of market expectations of 50.8 percent.  IBM has been moving away from its shrinking hardware and software businesses to what it calls \"strategic imperatives,\" which includes the contribution of cloud computing - where companies use a remote network of data centers instead of their own hardware to cut costs.  Strategic Imperatives grew 14 percent in the quarter.  \"Looking under the surface, however, it appears that strategic imperatives excluding Systems only grew 6 percent, largely driven by the lack of Cognitive Solutions growth,\" Berenberg analyst Josep Bori said.  \"This is clearly not enough to offset the declining core business,\" he said.  IBM said it would continue to \"maintain a high level of investment\" in 2018 as it boosts its capabilities on cloud, mobile, cybersecurity and data analytics.  \"This quarter was another important step in the right direction with 2018 a major prove me year for IBM to show the turnaround story is viable, which we believe it is, albeit at a snail-like pace,\" GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives said.

Youtube  At a congressional hearing this week, Jerry Cuomo, IBM's vice president of blockchain technology, testified about the potential governmental uses for blockchains.  Identification documents, payment systems, and systems that trace the movement of foods and drugs, are among the most promising initial governmental applications for the technology, Cuomo said.  Lawmakers were wowed by how much quicker blockchain technology has made the process of tracking down food products.  IBM wants to get Uncle Sam on a blockchain.  The digital ledger technology that underlies bitcoin is ready to be used for everything from paying taxes to tracking food and drug shipments to newer, more secure identification cards, said Jerry Cuomo, vice president of blockchain technology at IBM, at a hearing Wednesday organized by the Congressional Blockchain Caucus.  \"There is an opportunity for the United States to build upon its momentum to lead blockchain by doing,\" Cuomo said in his testimony. \"We should focus our efforts on projects that can positively impact US economic competitiveness, citizens, and businesses.\"  Cuomo encouraged lawmakers to focus on incorporating blockchain technology into already established governmental projects and programs, rather than trying to start new blockchain-themed initiatives. That could help speed its use and adoption and help the US stay at the forefront of blockchain development, he said.  Government agencies at both the federal and state level are already experimenting with the technology. Some states are developing blockchain-based drivers licenses and identification cards. Meanwhile, IBM is working with the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on some blockchain projects, including one that could speed the CDC's ability to develop new drugs.  Right now, drug development involves lots of paperwork. Blockchain technology could help improve the process by putting all of the important information related to drug development in an easily accessible and secure place online.  Developing new drugs \"doesn't just take a long time because people are slow,\" Cuomo said. \"The processes are extremely paper intensive. I see these groups taking the right first steps.\"  In an interview with Business Insider, Cuomo predicted that blockchain-based digital identities will be the first big project to take off at the federal level, because officials can build off the work going on in the states.  In addition to Cuomo, Frank Yiannas, vice president of food safety at Walmart, also testified at the hearing, talking about how his company is using blockchain technology. The retail giant has teamed up with IBM to develop a blockchain designed to track the movement of produce from farmers through distributors and stores to consumers. The technology could be useful in responding to reports of food contamination, when entities like the FDA need to quickly determine which food to recall.

Microsoft  IBM wanted Microsoft to provide games for its original PC \u2014 so Bill Gates took the task upon himself, working late into the night to produce the first PC game ever.  The game Gates and company came up with was \"DONKEY.BAS,\" an extremely simple and silly game about a car dodging donkeys in the road.  When Apple got their first look at the IBM PC, they thought \"DONKEY.BAS\" was particularly embarrassing, to the point where they couldn't believe Gates put his name on it.  It's the stuff of Silicon Valley legend: In 1980, a young Bill Gates convinced IBM that his tiny startup, Microsoft, was the perfect choice to provide the operating system for its new PC.  The problem was that Microsoft didn't actually have an operating system to sell. So Gates scrambled to buy one from a startup working on an operating system called 86-DOS, or \"disk operating system.\" It renamed the software PC DOS and sold it to IBM for $430,000 total.  As part of the deal, though, IBM wanted Microsoft to provide a version of BASIC, a programming language for beginners, along with a few simple games to show it off. What it came up with was \"DONKEY.BAS,\" a silly game about a car that has to avoid donkeys in the road.  It also happens to be the first PC game ever developed. Behold:  (The \".BAS\" part just means that it was written in BASIC.)  Here's how Gates described the process of building \"DONKEY.BAS\" in a 2001 keynote:  \"Actually, it was myself and Neil Konzen at four in the morning with this prototype IBM PC sitting in this small room. IBM insisted that we had to have a lock on the door, and we only had this closet that had a lock on it, so we had to do all our development in there, and it was always over 100 degrees, but we wrote late at night a little application to show what the BASIC built into the IBM PC could do. And so that was DONKEY.BAS. It was, at the time, very thrilling.\"  Andy Hertzfeld, an early Apple employee, memorably recalled the first time the Macintosh team saw an IBM PC and being especially unimpressed with the selection of games onboard. He singled out \"DONKEY.BAS\" as the \"most embarrassing game,\" saying that \"the concept of the game was as bad the crude graphics that it used.\"  Hertzfeld said of discovering this terrible game was made by none other than Gates:  \"We were surprised to see that the comments at the top of the game proudly proclaimed the authors: Bill Gates and Neil Konzen. Neil was a bright teenage hacker who I knew from his work on the Apple II (who would later become Microsoft's technical lead on the Mac project) but we were amazed that such a thoroughly bad game could be coauthored by Microsoft's cofounder, and that he would actually want to take credit for it in the comments.\"  In 2001, to show off how far the company had come, Microsoft built a 3D version of \"DONKEY.BAS,\" called \"DONKEY.NET,\" where the aim is to hit donkeys with a car. You can download a version of it, but it's difficult to get running on modern systems.  The IBM PC. Wikimedia Commons  But if you want to play the original \"DONKEY.BAS,\" you're in luck. MIT is hosting a browser-based version, while an enterprising developer built an iPhone and Apple Watch version that you can buy for 99 cents. You can also play another early DOS game, \"GORILLAS.BAS,\" in the browser.  Gates became a massive fan of another classic Microsoft game: He was such a fan of Minesweeper that he had to delete it from his computer to stay productive \u2014 still, he would end up sneaking into his executives' offices to play it.", "stock": "IBM", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-02", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://uk.businessinsider.com/bill-gates-donkey-bas-game-2017-2?r=US&amp;IR=T"}, {"article": "IBM CEO Ginni Rometty IBM  IBM told investors Thursday that it has over 400 clients with projects on its blockchain platform.  Among its biggest clients are companies like Walmart and Nestl\u00e9. It also disclosed a list of banks and trade companies using its blockchain.  Blockchain technology is often associated with cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, but enterprises are taking it on as a new tool for trade and payments.  IBM's foray into blockchain technology is catching on with customers, according to an investor briefing shared by the company on Thursday.  At least 400 IBM customers are now running blockchain-based projects, according to the briefing. Among those customers are 63 that work together with certain themes: 25 companies in global trade, 14 companies in food tracking, and 14 companies in global payments. Some of IBM's most recognizable blockchain clients include Nestl\u00e9, Visa, Walmart, and HSBC.  While blockchains continue to be widely associated with startups and crypto-millionaires, IBM's client list shows that large enterprises are truly embracing the technology.  IBM and Walmart actually launched a joint food safety blockchain project globally last year, which enables the grocery chain to figure out where specific produce originated in a matter of seconds.  Why the blockchain?  Blockchains, the technology that underlies cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, have caught on in enterprise as an efficient and comprehensive way of tracking both physical and digital items \u2014 from inventory to online payments. Often, these blockchains are decentralized, meaning they're spread across many machines on a network. This redundancy makes it difficult for any one party to falsify the information contained on the blockchain.  Conventionally, blockchains like the one that powers bitcoin are public, so that anyone can see the changes that are made. It's an important aspect of most cryptocurrencies that the blockchain is accessible to all, to eliminate the possibility of shady dealings.  But IBM's product, which is built on top of an open-source blockchain called Hyperledger Fabric, uses \"permissioned networks.\" This means companies can have some of the information on their bespoke blockchain be publicly viewable, and some of it locked behind a password or other security mechamism.  A global trader like the Dow Chemical Company (an IBM blockchain user) may want to have an immutable receipt between itself and its trade partners in order to guarantee that no one is being scammed. But it doesn't necessarily want that information to be viewable by its competitors \u2014 or, say, the media.  In global shipping, IBM's clients include Maersk, Du Pont and Dow Chemical. Its food trust customers include Walmart, Nestl\u00e9, Kroger and Unilever. Its global payment customers include Visa, the Polynesian payments company KlickEx, EarthPort, Nab,, BBVA and CIBC. And in trade finance, IBM's customers include Societe General, WeTrade, HSBC, Unicredit, and Santander.  They're not the only ones rushing towards the blockchain, either. JD.com, the Amazon of China, is launching a project to put high-end beef imports on a blockchain so that its customers can see where their meat has been.  Editor's note: The original headline for this story said IBM has at least 63 blockchain clients. The actual number is over 400.

Each student at Basis Independent Silicon Valley takes a minimum of six Advanced Placement courses and completes their graduation requirements before senior year, when they embark on capstone classes and independent research. Many go onto top colleges like Stanford and Cornell.  In class, kids develop a mastery of all things STEM \u2014 science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. And for some students, the school could be just a stepping stone on their way to becoming the next Elon Musk or Mark Zuckerberg.  Founded in 2014, Basis Independent Silicon Valley belongs to a network of private and charter schools with 31 outposts around the world.

Anne McKee started coding just three years ago with a class at a local community college.  McKee was one of three global winners among 17,000 students that participated in this year's competition.  Mainframes are still widely in use at banks, insurance companies, and other big businesses that handle lots of credit card transactions.  You might think of the mainframe computer as long-gone relic of the Cold War. But banks, especially, still rely on modern versions of the old classic: They're huge and old-fashioned, sure, but they're also proven to be mega-reliable.  Fast forward to today, and meet Anna McKee, a 22-year-old college senior at the University of North Texas, who was named the winner of the IBM Master of the Mainframe programming contest last week \u2014 making her the first woman from North America to take the title.  \"I started saying 'oh my gosh' repeatedly and my poor parents who I was on the phone with thought I got into a car accident or something,\" McKee told Business Insider, of the moment she won. \"And then they just started yelling on the other end. They were so excited. It was awesome.\"  McKee was, truly, shocked that she would win. She had only started coding three years earlier, starting with a class at a local community college. She entered the contest thinking she would have a hard time even completing it. She never thought she actually stood a chance. In fact, she only competed because both of her parents work with mainframes, and urged her to enter.  Her prizes: A $2,750 travel stipend to go to the closest IBM head office to meet with executives and recruiters; an HTC Vive virtual reality headset; a \"Master of the Mainframe\" hoodie.  The learning curve  The mainframe might have fallen out of favor, as PCs, smartphones, and now cloud computing give people access to so much computing power in much smaller packages. The problem is that, even though mainframes are still so critical at many businesses, programming novices are getting drawn to the newer platforms, causing a huge skills shortage.  That's part of why IBM has run the Master of the Mainframe competition since 2005, as a way to entice students to learn the intracicies of the mainframe.  \"We really want to give students a learning opportunity on one of the world's biggest enterprise IT platforms,\" Meredith Stowell, director of community engagement and skills for IBM's Mainframe team, told Business Insider.  One of IBM's more modern zEnterprise mainframes. IBM zEnterprise System mainframe  This year saw the biggest turnout in the contest's history: 17,000 students, 23% of which were women, all competed McKee was the only woman to place among the 15 global and regional winners.  \"I had no idea I was the the first female win in North America,\" said McKee. \"I was just trying to do the best I could.\"  Master of the Mainframe  The Master of the Mainframe competition takes the form of three rounds of challenges, culminating in a stage that requires contestants to build their own application by sorting and tracking data from over 600 companies. Contestants connect to a IBM mainframe virtually, from a terminal on their own computer.  Contestants have three months to complete the Master of the Mainframe challenge. McKee finished in two weeks.  \"I worked day and night to complete it,\" McKee said. \"Everything else, my homework and everything, was put on the back burner.\"  In high school, McKee was particularly adept at math and music, but didn't know how that could translate into a career. On a whim, during the summer after her freshman year of college, McKee enrolled in a basic C++ programming course at a nearby community college. She struggled through it, but she was \"intrigued\" and decided to sign up for a class in the Java programming language. IBM  That's when things changed. She enjoyed programming in Java so much, she declared a major in business computer information systems. She also joined the Association for Information Systems, a professional association for the IT industry.  And she's noticed a promising change, too. Over the past year, McKee said, more women have been attending AIS meetings. A few weeks before IBM told McKee she won Master of the Mainframe, she noticed something unusual at the latest AIS meeting: the room was about 50% women.  \"It's something that really surprised me and I really hope that things are shifting so that more women are getting into technology,\" she said.", "stock": "IBM", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-25", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/ibm-master-of-the-mainframe-winner-anna-mccay-interview-2018-3"}, {"article": "Skeptics abound. IBM is expected to have gotten an extra lift in the most recent quarter from currency gains and strong sales of a new line of mainframe computers. Without that help, the company\u2019s revenue would decline by 2 percent or so, according to an estimate from A. M. Sacconaghi, a financial analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein.  \u201cIs a turnaround afoot? I don\u2019t see it yet,\u201d Mr. Sacconaghi said.  There is no doubt, though, that there are signs of progress at IBM, which would not comment on its financial picture before the release of the earning report. So much attention is focused on the company\u2019s top line because revenue is the broadest measure of the headway IBM is making in a difficult transformation toward cloud computing, data handling and A.I. offerings for corporate customers.  Photo  The new businesses \u2014 \u201cstrategic imperatives,\u201d IBM calls them \u2014 now account for 45 percent of the company\u2019s revenue. And though it still has a ways to go, IBM has steadily built up those operations \u2014 and gained converts.  The number of software developers using its cloud technology has doubled in the last year, IBM says, though it would not provide numbers. On Wednesday, Barclays upgraded IBM\u2019s stock to a buy and noted its long-term opportunity in the cloud market. IBM\u2019s stock price, a notable laggard as markets have surged in recent years, has climbed nearly 10 percent so far this year.  IBM was slow to recognize the significance of cloud computing and software tools delivered as Internet-style services. In artificial intelligence, the company scored a research and public relations triumph in 2011, when its Watson system defeated human champions in the question-and-answer game, \u201cJeopardy!\u201d But IBM first applied the Watson technology to the daunting realm of cancer research, a lengthy struggle with little short-term financial reward.  Today, IBM trails well behind Amazon Web Services and Microsoft in the cloud market, according to analysts. Yet IBM has invested heavily in more than 60 cloud data centers in 19 countries in the past three years. And the most recent analysis by IDC, a technology research firm, and a report last month by Jefferies, a Wall Street firm, ranked IBM third in the category, ahead of Google.  The Watson technology has been retooled as dozens of different services including text understanding, language translation, image recognition and sentiment analysis \u2014 all delivered via the cloud and available \u00e0 la carte.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  IBM\u2019s strategy is to offer businesses cloud computing, A.I. technology and industry expertise tailored for each customer. Big companies, said David Kenny, senior vice president for IBM\u2019s Watson and cloud businesses, are adapting cloud and A.I. technology to make their businesses faster and smarter.  \u201cWe start from our strength in knowing how enterprises operate,\u201d Mr. Kenny said. \u201cWe\u2019re a trusted partner for companies in this data and A.I. wave.\u201d  Photo  Companies want to move quickly, Mr. Kenny said, but they often want to exploit the speed and flexibility of cloud technology from within their own computer centers, where they figure their vital business data is more secure.  AT&T began a project with IBM last fall to accelerate the use of cloud technology in developing and updating the telecommunications giant\u2019s 2,200 in-house software applications. IBM \u2014 a longtime technology supplier to AT&T \u2014 was chosen both for its cloud expertise and its industry knowledge, said Sorabh Saxena, AT&T\u2019s president of business operations.  The AT&T-IBM collaboration involves breaking down programs into cloud-based building blocks of code called microservices, each of which handles a certain task. So a new feature for mobile payments, for example, can be adopted quickly by updating a few lines of code rather than having to rewrite an entire program.

Most of this business software uses cloud technology that runs inside AT&T data centers \u2014 in a so-called private cloud, in contrast to a public cloud in which computing services are delivered from remote data centers owned by another company. Many corporations opt for private clouds to house their most sensitive customer and business data.  \u201cFor certain parts of our business, IBM was the ideal partner,\u201d Mr. Saxena said.  IBM emphasizes its hybrid stance in the cloud market, offering both private and public cloud technology to its corporate clients. In its financial reporting, IBM also includes all the hardware, software and services it sells to companies to build private clouds in its total cloud revenue, which would put it on a par with Amazon.  Most industry analysts focus on the public cloud market, assuming it will grow faster as companies build fewer data centers themselves. In the public cloud market, IBM has revenue of about $2 billion a year, growing at 30 percent, according to the most recent estimate by IDC. By contrast, Amazon generates more than $12 billion a year and Microsoft about $6.5 billion.  Yet for IBM, its underlying cloud software is crucial to building a big A.I. business with Watson. \u201cIBM has a strong set of assets in A.I.,\u201d said Ed Anderson, an analyst at Gartner. \u201cAnd cloud is the answer to getting Watson in the hands of developers.\u201d  Photo  That was the appeal for Opentopic, a start-up that uses A.I. technology to mine online and corporate data for marketing insights. Opentopic switched from Amazon Web Services to the IBM cloud in 2015, largely to tap Watson\u2019s code modules for text, image and sentiment analysis, so the Opentopic developers had to write less code themselves.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  \u201cIt allows us to prototype rapidly,\u201d said Andre Konig, a co-founder of Opentopic. \u201cAnd Watson is the artificial intelligence layer that makes that possible.\u201d  The start-up\u2019s clients include Unilever, Abbott Laboratories and The Economist. Today, Opentopic does all its software development on the IBM cloud, but that will most likely change soon.  It is working with a new company that runs its business on the Amazon cloud. \u201cWe need to be where our customers are,\u201d Mr. Konig said. \u201cThe future is going to be multi-cloud,\u201d meaning businesses will use various services.  His comment points to a brewing issue for IBM \u2014 and perhaps one that will help determine the resilience of Ms. Rometty\u2019s turnaround campaign.  IBM is putting all its advanced technology on the cloud \u2014 not just artificial intelligence, but also blockchain and quantum computing. If others are leaders in the underlying cloud layers, why not focus higher up and distribute its leading-edge technology on other clouds as well?  IBM says its Watson software, for example, is fine-tuned down to the chip level for the IBM cloud. But some analysts suggest that IBM may eventually take another path, working with Amazon, Microsoft and Google.  \u201cIf IBM does that,\u201d said Frank Gens, IDC\u2019s chief analyst, \u201cits chance of being a cloud leader goes way up.\u201d", "stock": "IBM", "label": -1, "date": "2018-01-17", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/17/technology/ibm-earnings.html"}, {"article": "Photo  IBM reported revenue growth for the first time in five and a half years on Thursday, ending a streak of 22 consecutive quarters of shrinking sales.

The quarterly result will also not erase the doubts of industry analysts who are skeptical that a genuine turnaround is underway at IBM.  But the company\u2019s fourth-quarter report is an encouraging sign that IBM\u2019s financial performance is stabilizing, and perhaps the transformation effort led by Virginia M.

Today, facial recognition software is being deployed by companies in various ways, including to help target product pitches based on social media profile pictures. But companies are also experimenting with face identification and other A.I. technology as an ingredient in automated decisions with higher stakes like hiring and lending.  Researchers at the Georgetown Law School estimated that 117 million American adults are in face recognition networks used by law enforcement \u2014 and that African Americans were most likely to be singled out, because they were disproportionately represented in mug-shot databases.  Facial recognition technology is lightly regulated so far.  \u201cThis is the right time to be addressing how these A.I. systems work and where they fail \u2014 to make them socially accountable,\u201d said Suresh Venkatasubramanian, a professor of computer science at the University of Utah.  Until now, there was anecdotal evidence of computer vision miscues, and occasionally in ways that suggested discrimination. In 2015, for example, Google had to apologize after its image-recognition photo app initially labeled African Americans as \u201cgorillas.\u201d  Sorelle Friedler, a computer scientist at Haverford College and a reviewing editor on Ms. Buolamwini\u2019s research paper, said experts had long suspected that facial recognition software performed differently on different populations.  \u201cBut this is the first work I\u2019m aware of that shows that empirically,\u201d Ms. Friedler said.  Ms. Buolamwini, a young African-American computer scientist, experienced the bias of facial recognition firsthand. When she was an undergraduate at the Georgia Institute of Technology, programs would work well on her white friends, she said, but not recognize her face at all. She figured it was a flaw that would surely be fixed before long.  Photo  But a few years later, after joining the M.I.T. Media Lab, she ran into the missing-face problem again. Only when she put on a white mask did the software recognize hers as a face.

Now 28 and a doctoral student, after studying as a Rhodes scholar and a Fulbright fellow, she is an advocate in the new field of \u201calgorithmic accountability,\u201d which seeks to make automated decisions more transparent, explainable and fair.  Her short TED Talk on coded bias has been viewed more than 940,000 times, and she founded the Algorithmic Justice League, a project to raise awareness of the issue.  In her newly published paper, which will be presented at a conference this month, Ms. Buolamwini studied the performance of three leading face recognition systems \u2014 by Microsoft, IBM and Megvii of China \u2014 by classifying how well they could guess the gender of people with different skin tones. These companies were selected because they offered gender classification features in their facial analysis software \u2014 and their code was publicly available for testing.

To test the commercial systems, Ms. Buolamwini built a data set of 1,270 faces, using faces of lawmakers from countries with a high percentage of women in office. The sources included three African nations with predominantly dark-skinned populations, and three Nordic countries with mainly light-skinned residents.  The African and Nordic faces were scored according to a six-point labeling system used by dermatologists to classify skin types. The medical classifications were determined to be more objective and precise than race.  Then, each company\u2019s software was tested on the curated data, crafted for gender balance and a range of skin tones. The results varied somewhat. Microsoft\u2019s error rate for darker-skinned women was 21 percent, while IBM\u2019s and Megvii\u2019s rates were nearly 35 percent. They all had error rates below 1 percent for light-skinned males.  Ms. Buolamwini shared the research results with each of the companies.

But the group had made it clear to the White House that it would not be pleased with any measure that had tariffs \u201cas the primary or even a significant remedy.\u201d  \u201cThe reason is that it would be a tax on consumers,\u201d Mr. Kallmer said, \u201cprecisely the people we are trying to support.\u201d  Many of the trade measures that Mr. Trump has proposed, including the steel and aluminum tariffs, have divided his advisers, the business community and the Republican Party. But the White House has boasted that its targeting of China\u2019s trade practices has broad support from industries on the losing end of the Chinese approach.  That theory could make it more difficult for American companies to operate in a country that already puts up steep barriers.  American companies and business groups have frequently complained that China blocks off valuable markets from American competition, including technology, media and finance, and that it does so in violation of commitments it made when it joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. China has imposed regulations that require American companies to share their technology with Chinese partners, for example, mandating that foreign companies operate through joint ventures if they want access to Chinese consumers. At times, the Chinese have resorted to stealing vital technologies through cyberwarfare, according to United States authorities.  Late last month, the White House said it would crack down on that behavior, outlining a series of actions aimed at punishing China for its trade barriers.  As Mr. Trump advances a series of tough trade measures to confront these behaviors, however, cracks have appeared in American industry\u2019s seemingly united front.

Any American company that wants to be a global player cannot afford to lose access to China\u2019s growing market, executives say.  Photo  Technology companies argue that the restrictive measures the administration is taking to help protect them could end up penalizing American manufacturing, raising costs and making their companies less competitive globally. And industries most vulnerable to retaliation, like agriculture, are protesting about losing valuable export opportunities. While the Chinese did not target soybeans in their initial tariffs list, many in the soybean industry worry they will be penalized in a trade dispute given China\u2019s importance as a market for exports.  The 25 percent tariff on pork that China imposed on Monday is expected to be particularly harmful, including in regions that supported the president, like Iowa, North Carolina and Indiana. Last year, American farmers sent more than a billion dollars\u2019 worth of pork to China, their largest export market by value after Japan and Mexico.  \u201cBecause we\u2019re so blessed to have America feed the world, we\u2019re also the first industry to get slammed whenever there are trade difficulties between the U.S. and other countries,\u201d Denise Bode, the coordinator for the American Fruit and Vegetable Processors and Growers Coalition.

These new tariffs are a drag on their ability to make ends meet.\u201d  Since Mr. Trump announced the China measures on March 22, American officials, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and the United States trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, have been in talks with the Chinese about ways to resolve their differences. The sides have discussed concessions like reducing China\u2019s tariffs on American cars, opening up its market for financial services and purchasing more semiconductors or natural gas, people familiar with the talks said.  However, analysts and companies involved in China said that these measures appeared unlikely to adequately resolve American concerns about China\u2019s longstanding encroachment on American intellectual property.  Companies are waiting anxiously for the administration to release a list of Chinese products this week that will be subject to tariffs \u2014 most likely the kind of high-tech products that the administration has accused China of targeting. The retail industry, which lobbied the administration and Congress against an early plan to impose tariffs on Chinese-made apparel and footwear, is now cautiously optimistic that its products will be exempt.  Restrictions on Chinese investment are expected to follow in the coming weeks. Administration officials have said those rules will aim to restore reciprocity with the Chinese, though it is not clear if the United States will go so far as to bar Chinese companies from investing in the same industries that China restricts. The White House is also considering the use of an emergency economy powers act that could allow it to restrict Chinese investments.

Last month, the committee stalled a hostile takeover of Qualcomm, a California-based chip maker, by a Singapore company, largely over concerns about ceding semiconductor prowess to China.  G.E. and IBM, which operate through joint ventures and other partnerships in China and around the world, have both lobbied against the expansion of Cfius over concerns that restrictions on joint ventures with foreign companies that include the transfer of valuable skills or technology could weaken the position of American companies abroad.  Financial firms, including Goldman Sachs and the Carlyle Group, have also expressed concern about investment restrictions, saying they could provide a drag on the United States economy.  White House advisers, in turn, have complained that previous approaches to dealing with China have not worked, and that companies are overreacting to legitimate trade measures.

The simple grading system used by restaurant regulators can and should be a model to inform the public about the digital security of businesses that store sensitive consumer data. A letter grade is a crude measure to assess a complex issue like cybersecurity to be sure, but what the metric lacks in nuance it makes up for with brute force.  Current measures to assess cyber-preparedness are either not compulsory or too complex. The federal government\u2019s National Institute of Standards and Technology framework is widely respected, but it\u2019s voluntary, underused and not easily digestible for the average consumer. Only seven Fortune 500 companies mentioned it in their annual filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission last year, and only one said it had adopted it.  MSCI \u2014 an index provider and independent research firm for institutional investors \u2014 ranks companies on cybersecurity. More than a year before Equifax\u2019s breach was revealed, MSCI scored Equifax a 0 out of 10 on privacy and data security. As prescient as it was, consumers would have had difficulty absorbing such a rating, which is just one of several components that MSCI uses to arrive at an environmental, social and governance, or E.S.G., rating of overall corporate citizenship.  A new grading system should start with the basics: Are companies on top of data security, and if hacked, do they know how to reduce the impact?  Each year, the Ponemon Institute, an independent research group, and IBM look at the cost of the average data security breach, as well as the average cost of each piece of data compromised. In 2017, the average cost of a data breach in the United States was $7.35 million, or $141 per record compromised. But if a company has an incident response team, uses encryption, trains its employees, has a business continuity program and monitors cyber-threat intelligence, that reduces the cost of the average data breach by nearly 47 percent. Using these five factors \u2014 weighed for their impact of cost reduction \u2014 is a simple starting point.  There are plenty of details to be worked out about a cybersecurity grading system. But the one nonnegotiable aspect would be that, once assigned, letter grades must be made highly accessible to the public. Companies should be required to display their grades prominently at their physical locations, on their websites, on certain documents (mortgage applications, for example) and on credit card readers.

Japanese companies were at the forefront of the electronics industry then, and Reagan administration officials mustered intense pressure to force Fairchild to cancel the deal (it later struck a deal with National Semiconductor). But the threat of more Japanese investment led Congress to pass the Exon-Florio Amendment in 1988, granting the president the ability to stop a foreign acquisition if there is \u201ccredible evidence\u201d that a \u201cforeign interest exercising control might take action that threatens to impair the national security.\u201d  Cfius was empowered with reviewing mergers for potential threats.  China is a frequent element in the deals Cfius reviews  Cfius reviews deals across a variety of industries and companies from dozens of different countries. It has often set its sites on deals involving Chinese companies, as the country\u2019s economic might has grown in recent years. From 2013 to 2015, the latest years for which the committee has made data public, about 20 percent of the deals that Cfius reviewed involved investors from China.  Among the notable recent reviews were:  MONEYGRAM \u2014 ANT FINANCIAL Ant Financial, a Chinese electronic payments company, wanted to purchase MoneyGram, a money transfer company based in Dallas, for $1.2 billion. But the deal collapsed in January after both sides said Cfius refused to approve it. The collapse came despite a charm offensive by Jack Ma, the Chinese tycoon who controls Ant Financial, who had visited President-elect Donald Trump at Trump Tower and pledged to create one million American jobs. But he could not overcome the Trump administration\u2019s concerns about Chinese acquisition of American know-how. CANYON BRIDGE CAPITAL \u2014 LATTICE Canyon Bridge Capital, a private equity firm, wanted to acquire Lattice, a chip maker based in Portland, Ore. Canyon Bridge received investment from a group that included China Venture Capital Fund Corporation, which is owned by Chinese government-backed organizations. Lattice said Cfius objected to the deal, and the company tried to appeal to the president, offering to resolve national security concerns. But Mr. Trump formally blocked the deal in September 2017, prompting China\u2019s commerce ministry to issue a statement saying countries should not push protectionism through security reviews. GO SCALE \u2014 PHILIPS In 2015, the Dutch electronics giant Philips had an agreement to sell a controlling stake in its automotive and LED business for as much as $2.9 billion to GO Scale, an investment fund sponsored by GSR Ventures of China and Oak Investment Partners. Philips canceled the deal after it could not resolve Cfius\u2019s concerns, and in December 2016 announced it would sell the unit to Apollo Global Management for $1.5 billion, almost half the amount of the earlier deal.  The Broadcom-Qualcomm deal does not involve China-based companies. But there has been concern that the acquisition could undermine the ability of the United States to compete with China in the race for telecommunications supremacy. Members of Cfius pointed to Broadcom\u2019s statements that it would take a \u201c\u2018private equity\u2019-style\u201d approach if it acquired Qualcomm, suggesting to the committee that Broadcom could reduce long-term investment on research and development in favor of focusing on short-term profits.  While the United States has remained a standard-bearer in mobile technology, the committee noted, \u201cChina would likely compete robustly to fill any void left by Qualcomm as a result of this hostile takeover.\u201d  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Lawmakers want to expand Cfius\u2019s jurisdiction  A bipartisan group in Congress has proposed legislation that would greatly expand the number of deals reviewed by Cfius. In November, Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, and Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, introduced a bill that could add thousands of companies with foreign ties to the list of those reviewed each year by Cfius and provide more funding to deal with that increase. A similar House bill was also introduced by Representative Robert Pittenger, Republican of North Carolina. The measure would expand Cfius\u2019s jurisdiction to include joint ventures, sales of minority stakes and real estate deals for property near military bases and other sensitive facilities.  \u201cBy exploiting gaps in the existing Cfius review process,\u201d said Mr. Cornyn, \u201cpotential adversaries, such as China, have been effectively degrading our country\u2019s military technological edge by acquiring, and otherwise investing in U.S. companies.\u201d  The proposal has drawn objections from some businesses.

But it is not the only risk. The new tariffs will inflict damage on the American economy even absent retaliation from abroad. If history is any guide, Mr. Trump is proposing to protect the homeland by shooting it in the foot.  The closest parallel is the moment in 2002 when President George W. Bush decided that, for the umpteenth time, domestic steel makers deserved a hand and imposed tariffs of 8 to 30 percent on a variety of steel products from many countries.  Imports from the affected countries plummeted, of course. But others \u2014 in steel categories not covered by the safeguard and from excluded countries protected by preferential deals \u2014 surged. Overall steel imports increased 3 percent over the next 12 months. Employment in the American steel industry kept declining. And according to one study, by the time the tariffs were lifted in 2003, higher steel prices had cost 200,000 jobs in steel-using companies, more than all the jobs in the steel industry itself.  Undeterred, President Barack Obama did roughly the same thing. After complaints about surging imports, he put tariffs on Chinese tires. Presumably nobody told him that American tire makers no longer produced the kind of low-grade tires exported by the Chinese. In any event, imports from other countries jumped 20 percent after the tariff was imposed. And the price of all imported tires rose by 18 percent, on average.  Gary Clyde Hufbauer and Sean Lowry at the Peterson Institute for International Economics calculated the additional cost to consumers at $1.1 billion \u2014 or about $900,000 per tire job saved. But the wages of workers whose jobs were saved amounted to about 5 percent of that.  The lesson is not that protectionism is porous. It is. And it can be gamed. Until a few years ago, Ford attached rear seats and rear windows to the Transit Connect vans it imported from its plant in Turkey. Once they had gone through customs \u2014 paying the 2.5 percent tariff on passenger vehicles instead of the heftier 25 percent levied on commercial vans \u2014 the seats and windows were ripped out and recycled.  The critical takeaway is that the distortions brought about by trade barriers impose a cost on the economy. It might not be easy to spot before the fact, but it tends to be more substantial than whatever fleeting gains protectionism can bring about to the protected.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Think of the multifiber agreement, which until its demise at the end of 2004 allowed the United States to impose individual quotas on thousands of pieces of apparel \u2014 cotton diapers from China, trousers from Guatemala. The rationale was to protect one of the lowest-wage industries in the country from lower wages in the developing world. A study by the United States International Trade Commission cited by the Dartmouth economist Douglas A. Irwin in his 2002 book, \u201cFree Trade Under Fire,\u201d concluded that it had raised apparel prices by 18 to 24 percent, imposing a particular burden on poor households.

A 63 percent tariff on advanced flat-panel screens for laptop computers in 1991 helped drive a stake through the heart of the American laptop industry itself. Japan\u2019s Toshiba stopped making laptops in the United States. Apple moved production to Ireland. An IBM spokesman called the decision \u201can eviction notice from the U.S. government to the fastest-growing part of the U.S. computer industry.\u201d  Similarly, the ring of protection around the sugar industry almost killed it instead. Hoping to protect a price floor for sugar of 16.75 cents a pound even as world prices sank, in the 1980s Washington resorted to increasingly stringent import quotas that drove domestic sugar prices up to five times the world average.  Clever Canadian firms sent sugary cake mixes to the United States \u2014 where the sugar was extracted. Other countries grabbed on to the tactic. In 1985, Washington put emergency quotas on all imports of sweetened cocoa, cake mixes and edible preparations. South Korean noodles \u2014 with 0.002 percent sugar content \u2014 were snagged in the dragnet. So was kosher pizza from Israel.  Then the unthinkable happened: Coke and Pepsi decided to replace expensive sugar with much cheaper high-fructose corn syrup. From 1980 to 1987, the share of sugar in American sweetener consumption, previously 65 percent, dropped to 47 percent.  \u201cIn the longer term, this market reaction to the sugar program may indeed threaten the economic viability of the entire sugar industry in the United States,\u201d the economist Anne O. Krueger noted in an analysis of the sugar supports.  Sugar quotas are still around, nonetheless. Candy makers including Hershey and Ferrara have moved factories offshore. In 2006, the International Trade Administration concluded that for each sugar growing and harvesting job saved between 1997 and 2002, three confectionary manufacturing jobs were lost.  Sugar quotas even undermined American policy to counter narcotics trafficking. The Central Intelligence Agency concluded that falling sugar exports encouraged farmers in Jamaica and Belize to switch to marijuana.  Mr. Trump might look back fondly at that long-ago chicken tax. In the 1980s, Detroit did everything it could to fend off Japanese automakers. It persuaded the Reagan administration to force the Japanese into \u201cvoluntary\u201d export restraints on cars \u2014 raising car prices for American consumers.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Nothing was as successful as the chicken wall. It eroded over time. S.U.V.s were ultimately allowed into the United States as cars. Japanese automakers started making monster pickups and S.U.V.s in the United States, too. Still, fewer than a quarter of cars sold in the United States are made in America. The share for light trucks is 54 percent.  But there was a cost: more expensive pickup trucks, for starters, not to mention the discarded seats and windows from Ford\u2019s Transit Connects. The tariff also successfully kept smaller, low-margin trucks from competing with the less-efficient models made at home. Alongside low gasoline prices and easy fuel-economy standards, Detroit\u2019s love affair with trucks arguably gave the United States the least fuel-efficient fleet in the industrial world.

As in sport, so in consulting, except in one important regard. Consulting, unlike the Olympics, is about the winning, not the taking part. So which is the best consultancy in the UK, based on the views of peers and clients?  For the UK\u2019s Leading Management Consultants 2018, Statista, the research and data provider, sorted recommendations into three categories. Six stars were awarded to firms \u201cvery frequently recommended\u201d in a consulting service or sector, five for \u201cfrequently recommended\u201d and four for \u201crecommended\u201d. Let us call these the gold, silver and bronze \u201cmedals\u201d in each \u201cevent\u201d. Deloitte, KPMG and McKinsey top the table by total number of medals \u2014 they each won star ratings in 29 sectors and services, the maximum.  This version of the table tells a familiar story: there is a gap between the largest, universal consultancies and the rest. Recommendations were made in at least 21 of the categories for the Big Four accountancy firms (Deloitte, KPMG, PwC and EY), the Big Three traditional strategy consultancies (McKinsey, Boston Consulting Group and Bain) and Accenture.  But this is only one way of arranging a medals table. At the 2016 Rio Olympics, for instance, Team GB won fewer medals overall than China, but beat China in the ranking by number of gold medals.  If one cuts the consulting medal tally in a similar way, it reveals a different picture: Accenture comes top. Despite gaining no medal ratings in two categories, it achieved 18 six-star ratings overall, against KPMG\u2019s 17, Deloitte\u2019s 12 and McKinsey\u2019s 11. This table also elevates IBM to equal fifth with PwC, for its nine \u201cgolds\u201d.  There is more to this than meets the eye. The Management Consultancies Association \u2014 a trade body whose members include Deloitte, KPMG and PwC \u2014 pointed out in its recent analysis of UK industry data that in 2016, the largest firms grew by 4 per cent on average. Medium-sized firms did better, growing by 6 per cent, and specialists\u2019 growth exceeded 20 per cent.  A similar story is told by our ranking. On overall medal tally, there is a notable gap between Bain (which garnered 21 six-, five- or four-star ratings) and the next highest groups, IBM (14) and AT Kearney and PA Consulting (13 each).  But the alternative view shows it is possible for specialists to win gold in single events. For example, Atkins Global topped the podium in the construction and infrastructure sector. OC&C was among the gold medallists in consumer goods and retail, and BAE destroyed all-comers in defence. Hay Group, part of Korn Ferry, the executive search firm, since 2015, wins gold in its specialist area of people and performance.  These companies join Oliver Wyman, Baringa and Simon-Kucher in a cluster of seven consultancies that won the top ranking in one sector or service. In this analysis of the ranking, they jump above AT Kearney and PA, which achieved no six-star ratings.  Some distinct subsidiaries of the biggest companies are winning recommendations, often by specialising, for example QuantumBlack, McKinsey\u2019s data analytics arm.  If anything, the ranking may overstate the importance of the bigger groups, whose balance sheets buy a lot of name recognition.  What an at-a-glance analysis of the table does suggest is that trying to be all things to all clients is probably futile unless you are one of the largest consultancies. On the other hand, a strategy of smart specialisation could pay off. After all, if you are a small nation that is home to the world\u2019s best weightlifters, why try to beat the USA in the track and field events?

Today many people rate plastic waste, particularly in the oceans, as a problem approaching climate change in its gravity.  Graphic images have raised public consciousness. Photographs have shown some of the world\u2019s most remote beaches that were pristine sand a decade or two ago now covered with plastic litter.  Films and television programmes such as David Attenborough\u2019s immensely popular Blue Planet II series have recorded heart-rending scenes of seabirds and marine creatures dying from plastics that they have mistakenly eaten or from debris entangled around their bodies.  People are also becoming alarmed by reading about the less visible but more pernicious problem of microplastics with dimensions measured in fractions of a millimetre. These come from various sources including the disintegration of larger plastic items, microbeads added to health and beauty products, and microfibres separating from clothing and fabrics during cleaning and laundry. The tiny particles and fibres are ingested by marine wildlife, with adverse consequences that environmental toxicologists are just beginning to investigate.  As the clamour to \u201cdo something\u201d rises in volume, politicians are responding with pledges to increase recycling and to reduce unnecessary plastic packaging. At the same time, research funds are starting to move into the field, prompting scientists and engineers to come up with ideas to tackle the problem, both by finding ways to remove existing waste from the oceans and, more importantly, to stem the flow of new plastics into the environment.  Professor Mariana Mazzucato of University College London proposed that Europe\u2019s next Framework research programme should adopt \u201ca plastic-free ocean\u201d as one of its grand challenges.  \u201cThis mission could have clear target to reduce the amount of plastic entering the marine environment by 90 per cent, and of collecting more than half of the plastic currently present in our oceans, seas and coastal areas,\u201d she says in a paper commissioned by EU science and innovation commissioner Carlos Moedas.  This would mean stopping at least 7.2m tonnes of plastic entering the marine environment and collecting at least 2m tonnes of plastic per annum, the paper adds, concluding that \u201ca very ambitious yet achievable timeline to reach this target would be circa five to 10 years\u201d.  Such a comprehensive attempt to tackle the crisis will require basic and applied research, as well as entrepreneurial innovation. The greatest technological challenge will be removing plastics from the oceans, through nets and booms moving across the sea surface which would gather up and remove or destroy rubbish \u2014 all without harming ocean life. The first targets might be the ocean gyres, circulating currents where plastics accumulate, of which the most notorious has become known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.  The Ocean Cleanup, a Dutch foundation that is planning to launch a clean-up operation there later this year, estimated in a study carried out from boats and aircraft and published this month that the Patch contains 1.8tn pieces of plastic weighing a total of 80,000 tonnes, covering 1.6m sq km of the North Pacific between California and Hawaii.  \u201cThese results provide us with the key data to develop and test our technology,\u201d says Boyan Slat, founder of Ocean Cleanup. \u201cSince the results indicate that the amount of hazardous microplastics is set to increase more than tenfold if left to fragment, the time to start is now.\u201d  The clean-up system is itself made of durable plastic. \u201cIt\u2019s quite poetic, like using fire to extinguish fire,\u201d says Mr Slat.  Floating screens extend 3m deep into the sea, suspended from ultra-strong U-shaped tubes 1km long and held in place by a drogue or sea anchor. As ocean currents flow past the screens they collect plastic debris, which can be collected every couple of months by ships for recycling or incineration.  If this year\u2019s trial of the first system goes well, Mr Slat hopes that as many as 60 collectors will be operating in the early 2020s, removing about half of the plastic from the Great Pacific Garbage Patch within five years.  Stopping plastics getting into the oceans in the first place will require a huge change in consumer behaviour and product design \u2014 fuelled by a global commitment by governments and business to phase out non-essential single-use plastics, particularly for packaging, and make it easier to recycle remaining plastic waste.  Such a circular economy will require plastic products to have a simple design, in which the different components are easily separated and the polymers from which they are made are clearly identifiable. At present the sorting machinery in recycling plants faces a confusing variety of materials mixed \u2014 or, worse, bonded \u2014 together.  Polymer chemists will also need to come up with new ways to recycle plastics that are elusive under current technology. A recent paper in the journal Science by Jeannette Garcia of IBM Almaden research centre in California and Megan Robertson of the University of Houston concluded that only two types of polymer are routinely recycled today: PET and polyethylenes, representing just 9 per cent and 37 per cent respectively of plastic production.  Researchers are already developing cost-effective new chemical recycling technologies for other plastics such as polystyrene. Such efforts, the authors say, \u201craise hope that before long recycling rates for plastics will be much higher than today\u201d.", "stock": "IBM", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-29", "source": "financial-times", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/0f3627ec-db6e-11e7-9504-59efdb70e12f"}, {"article": "Experimental feature Listen to this article Play audio for this article Pause 00:00 00:00 Experimental feature Report a mispronounced word What was mispronounced?

Our behaviour is changing as a result of an information and communications overload, both at work and in our personal lives. Finding a way to manage the barrage is an important challenge as the information economy develops.  Distractions at work, such as the constant inflow of emails, notifications and pop-up chats, take their toll. One study, by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University, found that the mere prospect of being distracted by a ringing mobile phone reduced test participants\u2019 cognition skills, measured by a test involving reading a passage of text and being asked questions about it.  Our addiction to smartphones and social media is also making us more fidgety. One study of Android users by research company Dscout found that people tapped, swiped and clicked their smartphones 2,617 times a day. Apple\u2019s products are sufficiently addictive to prompt activist investors to demand research be done into the negative impacts of phone use on children. There is growing concern about a mental health crisis in young people caused by the addictiveness of social media, the internet, and gaming.  When you get bored you ignite the \u2018default mode\u2019 in your brain, and this is where we do our most original thinking  \u201cThere is nothing new about the existence of an attention economy that monetises our eyeballs,\u201d says Cal Newport, associate professor of computer science at Georgetown University and author of Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World. \u201cBut when you combine this business model with powerful handheld devices that are always connected to the internet, algorithms being weaponized to extract as much of our time and attention as possible, and hundreds of billions of dollars of investment, suddenly the societal impacts become worrisome.\u201d  Prof Newport is worried about the next generation. \u201cIt is almost certainly true that young people are suffering a rapid decline in their ability to concentrate. Given the increasing share of the economy dedicated to knowledge work, in which concentrated thought is the primary driver of value production, this decline might start to impact large scale economic metrics, if it hasn\u2019t already\u201d.  Overcoming overload is hard, because we are addicted to information \u2014 or, more specifically, to novelty  If information overload stops us concentrating deeply, it also stops us resting deeply \u2014 and that is just as damaging. Boredom, zoning out and absent-mindedness are all fertile mental states for creativity. \u201cWe\u2019re at an interesting moment in neuroscience in terms of understanding how boredom is a gateway to mind-wandering,\u201d says Manoush Zomorodi, host of the WNYC podcast Note to Self and author of Bored and Brilliant.  \u201cWhen you get bored, say you are folding laundry, or doing something that doesn\u2019t require focused attention, you ignite the \u2018default mode\u2019 in your brain, and this is where we do our most original thinking,\u201d she says. \u201cWe take two seemingly disparate ideas and smash them together to make something new. And we do autobiographical planning. We look back at our life, take note of highs and lows, create personal narratives, and look at our future and decide where we want to go.\u201d  If in a quiet moment we instead check for emails or social media updates, then we may be in danger of losing the experience of boredom entirely.  Overcoming overload is hard, because we are addicted to information \u2014 or, more specifically, to novelty. This was helpful in the hunter-gatherer era, because it could lead us to food and resources. It is less helpful online, where we cannot ever be satiated. Companies are tapping this foraging-related brain circuitry to make products more addictive. One gamification firm, with clients including Disney and Google, even named itself Dopamine, after the brain chemical.  Some of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest names are raising the alarm, from Facebook\u2019s founding president Sean Parker to former Google design ethicist Tristan Harris.  Is there a solution?  \u00a9 EPA  Yet there are glimmers of hope. Consumers, and even investors, are paying more attention to the problem. Facebook published a study confirming that its users do indeed feel worse after \u2018passively\u2019 consuming social media. It argued however that social media increased wellbeing when people used them actively, especially when \u201csharing messages, posts and comments with close friends and reminiscing about past interactions\u201d. It recently announced changes to its news feed, to prioritise the sharing of meaningful content between friends.  At work, companies are deploying software, artificial intelligence and machine learning to bring order and structure to the informational chaos that many office workers now feel. Slack can reduce email overload by shifting high-volume, open-ended communications into chat forums. IBM Verse and SalesforceIQ sift information and prioritise actions for staff. Google has rolled out auto-reply suggestions on Gmail, with algorithms proposing possible replies to messages, and tools like Evernote consolidate scattered online and offline notes, links and resources.  Then there are the apps and internet blockers which forcibly disconnect people from certain sites, or during certain times, including Thrive App, from Arianna Huffington\u2019s wellbeing consultancy and Samsung.  The power of the humble notebook  Meanwhile Prof Newport, who gained tenure at the young age of 33 without working in the evenings or at weekends, says the humble notebook is his tool of choice. His reasons are subtle, relating to the ways in which the finitude of three dimensional space shapes our thinking. \u201cWhen scheduling your day in a notebook, the fact that the page is a fixed size embodies the reality that your time and attention are limited commodities. Days scheduled on paper tend to be more realistic and balanced than those driven [by] a bottomless inbox or voluminous digital task list.\u201d  Research also shows that writing on paper fires up the brain circuitry associated with language processing and engenders more attentive reading. All of which might give us reason to pause before rolling out the tablets, laptops and digital education for an already screen-sapped generation.

Conceived in collaboration with the science-fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke, \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey\u201d was way over budget, and Hollywood rumor held that MGM had essentially bet the studio on the project.  The film\u2019s previews were an unmitigated disaster. Its story line encompassed an exceptional temporal sweep, starting with the initial contact between pre-human ape-men and an omnipotent alien civilization and then vaulting forward to later encounters between Homo sapiens and the elusive aliens, represented throughout by the film\u2019s iconic metallic-black monolith. Although featuring visual effects of unprecedented realism and power, Kubrick\u2019s panoramic journey into space and time made few concessions to viewer understanding. The film was essentially a nonverbal experience. Its first words came only a good half-hour in.  Audience walkouts numbered well over 200 at the New York premiere on April 3, 1968, and the next day\u2019s reviews were almost uniformly negative. Writing in the Village Voice, Andrew Sarris called the movie \u201ca thoroughly uninteresting failure and the most damning demonstration yet of Stanley Kubrick\u2019s inability to tell a story coherently and with a consistent point of view.\u201d And yet that afternoon, a long line\u2014comprised predominantly of younger people\u2014extended down Broadway, awaiting the first matinee.  Stung by the initial reactions and under great pressure from MGM, Kubrick soon cut almost 20 minutes from the film. Although \u201c2001\u201d remained willfully opaque and open to interpretation, the trims removed redundancies, and the film spoke more clearly. Critics began to come around. In her review for the Boston Globe, Marjorie Adams, who had seen the shortened version, called it \u201cthe world\u2019s most extraordinary film. Nothing like it has ever been shown in Boston before, or for that matter, anywhere. The film is as exciting as the discovery of a new dimension in life.\u201d  \u2018Stanley and I are laughing all the way to the bank.\u2019  Although incomprehensible by prevailing Hollywood standards, Kubrick\u2019s cryptic, mostly dialogue-free structure fit well with the radical avant-garde artistic innovations of the period, and the movie was an immediate countercultural hit. John Lennon quipped, \u201c\u20182001\u2019? I see it every week,\u201d and David Bowie was inspired to record his hit single \u201cSpace Oddity\u201d just under a year later\u2014a clear allusion to the film. \u201c2001\u201d became a genuine late-\u201960s cultural happening and a bellwether of the decade\u2019s generational divide. With ticket sales brisk from day one, the production ended up the highest-grossing film of 1968. \u201cAs for the dwindling minority who still don\u2019t like it, that\u2019s their problem, not ours,\u201d Clarke wrote. \u201cStanley and I are laughing all the way to the bank.\u201d  Fifty years later, \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey\u201d is widely recognized as ranking among the most influential movies ever made. The most respected poll of such things, conducted every decade by the British Film Institute\u2019s Sight & Sound magazine, asks the world\u2019s leading directors and critics to name the 100 greatest films of all time. The last BFI decadal survey, conducted in 2012, placed it at No. 2 among directors and No. 6 among critics. Not bad for a film that critic Pauline Kael had waited a contemptuous 10 months before dismissing as \u201ctrash masquerading as art\u201d in the pages of Harper\u2019s.  Although the film\u2019s vision of humanity expanding throughout the solar system proved overoptimistic, its portrait of a screen-based, technology-mediated future now seems almost uncannily accurate, and it devastatingly evokes the dehumanization that can result from such communication. As for the cyclopean HAL-9000 supercomputer, often considered the most human character in \u201c2001,\u201d it foreshadowed our anxious contemporary discussion about the potentially dystopian impact of artificial-intelligence technologies.  The film\u2019s extraordinary predictive realism was entirely premeditated, the result of Kubrick and Clarke\u2019s questing, cerebral commitment to scientific and technical accuracy. By all accounts the production was run less like a big-budget Hollywood production than an extended futurological R&D exercise. A broad slate of top aerospace and computer companies were brought on board as consultants and advisers, with such leading innovators as IBM , Bell Labs and Hewlett-Packard all playing important roles.  In the summer of 1965, Kubrick received two detailed Bell Labs reports written by A. Michael Noll (a trailblazer in the development of digital arts and 3-D animation) and information theorist John R. Pierce (who coined the term \u201ctransistor\u201d and headed the team that built the first communications satellite). They recommended that the spacecraft systems in \u201c2001\u201d all feature multiple \u201cfairly large, flat and rectangular\u201d screens, with \u201cno indication of the massive depth of equipment behind them.\u201d Flat screens were, of course, unknown in the \u201960s\u2014at least outside of movie theaters\u2014and they helped to ensure 2001\u2019s futuristic sheen.  The film featured forward-looking flat-screen tablet computers. Photo: Mary Evans/Everett Collection  The role of the film\u2019s sentient supercomputer, originally named Athena, grew throughout the film\u2019s development, under the influence of discussions that Kubrick and Clarke held with MIT cognitive scientist and artificial intelligence pioneer Marvin Minsky and British cryptologist and mathematician I. J. Good. The computer\u2019s physical look resulted from advice provided by IBM\u2019s influential design bureau-think-tank\u2014the Apple Industrial Design Group of its day\u2014then led by industrial designer Eliot Noyes.  In July 1965, Noyes and his team provided drawings of astronauts floating within a kind of \u201cbrain room\u201d\u2014a concept that Kubrick initially rejected but later recognized as having intriguing dramatic possibilities. The astronaut Dave Bowman\u2019s methodical lobotomization of the computer after it\u2014or rather, \u201che\u201d\u2014had killed off the rest of the crew, conducted within the dappled red confines of the film\u2019s remarkable brain-room set, remains one of the most powerfully disturbing scenes ever committed to celluloid.  HAL stood for \u201cHeuristic Algorithmic,\u201d a Minsky suggestion. The computer\u2019s homicidal tendencies emerged only gradually, forcing the production to remove its original IBM nameplate and to substitute another acronym\u2014a kind of subliminal cognate, with \u201cHAL\u201d being displaced from \u201cIBM\u201d by only one letter in each case, something that both Kubrick and Clarke strenuously denied was intentional.  Another fascinating result of the production\u2019s consultation with Big Blue was the film\u2019s forward-looking flat-screen tablet computers, which retained their IBM logos and were called \u201cNewspads.\u201d Constructed long before such technologies were feasible, the movie\u2019s seemingly portable Newspads were actually welded to the tables on which they appeared casually placed, with hidden 16mm film projectors recessed underneath to provide content for their frosted-glass displays.  In the film\u2019s final cut, the Newspads were only used by the astronauts to watch a TV program ostensibly from the BBC and were thus largely indistinguishable from the various other displays embedded in the sets. But the production had received permission from the New York Times to use its logo, and Kubrick\u2019s designers had mocked up a digital front page for the Newspads, complete with multiple story choices to be accessed by touch-screen command. If the page had been used, the movie would almost certainly now be seen as having predicted the internet.  More than four decades later, however, the predictive futurism of \u201c2001\u201d was decisively ratified when Apple released its first iPad in 2010. Samsung issued a similar device a year later, and Apple immediately sued for patent infringement. That August the Korean company filed a response in federal court in San Jose, Calif., asserting that Apple couldn\u2019t possibly have invented the iPad because the device had already been envisioned in \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey.\u201d  Samsung\u2019s unusual defense, which featured both stills and YouTube links from the film, was ultimately ruled inadmissible as evidence, but it confirmed what many fans have long appreciated: the continuing relevance and still-startling prescience of Kubrick\u2019s masterpiece.  \u2014Mr. Benson is the author of \u201cSpace Odyssey: Stanley Kubrick, Arthur Clarke and the Making of a Masterpiece,\u201d which will be published on April 3 by Simon & Schuster.", "stock": "IBM", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-09", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-kubricks-2001-a-space-odyssey-saw-into-the-future-1520609361"}, {"article": "Shipping giant A.P.

The companies, which began collaborating on the new technology in 2016, said the new company\u2019s platform could be used to streamline operations for the entire global shipping ecosystem. Large companies such as DowDuPont Inc. already have piloted the platform.  The idea came from the current stack of paperwork needed to process and track the shipping of goods. Maersk said the maximum cost of the required trade documentation to process and administer many of the goods shipped each year is estimated to reach one-fifth of the actual physical transportation costs.

The companies said blockchain, the technology behind increasingly popular cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, is ideal for organizing large networks with different partners like the shipping industry, which transports more that $4 trillion goods a year.  \u201cThe potential from offering a neutral, open digital platform for safe and easy ways of exchanging information is huge, and all players across the supply chain stand to benefit,\u201d said Vincent Clerc, chief commercial officer at Maersk and future chairman of the board of the new joint venture.  More corporations, including General Motors Co. and Procter & Gamble Co. , have expressed interest in the platform and are exploring ways to use it to streamline supply chains and customs clearance. Singaporean and Peruvian customs also are exploring collaborating with the platform to facilitate trade flows and enhance supply chain security.  The move comes as Maersk and IBM have been attempting to reinvent themselves. IBM, the 106-year-old technology giant, has been looking to new lines of business including blockchain as sales in its legacy business of selling hardware and software slow. Maersk has been trying to transform itself to into a global supply-chain major like United Parcel Service Inc. and FedEx Corp. by integrating its transport and logistics units and spinning off its oil business.  The new company will be headquartered in the New York metropolitan area and led by former president of Maersk Line in North America Michael White.  Solutions from the joint venture are expected to become available within six months of regulatory clearance.

International Business Machines reported Thursday that fourth-quarter revenue rose nearly 4% year over year. Even adjusting for a boost from favorable currency rates, Big Blue\u2019s top line managed its first period of growth in nearly six years. Strong sales of systems hardware business along with IBM\u2019s growing cloud-computing service contributed to the uplift.  Still, IBM\u2019s shares fell Friday, much like they have done following 10 of its last 12 quarterly reports. A bit of growth, as it turns out, isn\u2019t quite enough to assuage concerns about how the company gets there. Fourth-quarter gross margins slipped below the 50% line for the first time in five years for what is typically the company\u2019s strongest seasonal period. And, while IBM did project annual revenue growth for 2018, it is unclear if the company can do that without continued help from favorable exchange rates.  Given that IBM\u2019s stock had jumped more than 15% since its last quarterly report, some disappointment was bound to set in. The company also expects a slight drop in free cash flow in 2018 due to increased capital spending in key segments to drive future growth. IBM did manage to close 2017 with a small gain in adjusted per-share earnings of $13.80 after three years of declines. But the company also projected flat earnings for 2018, given its need to invest more in its business.  Those investments have borne some fruit. The \u201cstrategic imperatives\u201d IBM has been so focused on for the last few years accounted for 46% of total revenue for 2017, compared to 41% the year before.

Robert Pittenger\u2019s \u201cHow China Pushes the Limits on Military Technology Transfer\u201d (op-ed, March 14): Few Americans would argue against measures to make this country more secure, and most would agree that protecting national security requires the proper tools. Still, many more would agree that being factual when discussing this topic is absolutely critical.  Legislation recently introduced in Congress and advocated in these pages by Rep. Robert Pittenger would make some needed improvements to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (Cfius). For example, the measure would expand the ability of the government to block the purchase of buildings or other real estate near military installations.  But Mr. Pittenger\u2019s bill\u2014the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act\u2014goes much, much farther. It would drastically expand the mission of Cfius, an interagency committee staffed by fewer than a dozen people at the Treasury Department, bringing under government review countless international sales and licensing transactions by U.S. companies.  The new remit of Cfius would include such things as standard computer service and support contracts, technology manuals needed to operate machinery purchased by foreign customers and even the licensing of trademarks. Technologies that never were deemed sensitive by the Defense Department or that were long ago removed from control by the U.S. and its allies would be subject to new and opaque regulation by Cfius.  More concerning is that Mr. Pittenger\u2019s bill would do all of this unilaterally\u2014without any effort at cooperation with our allies. The U.S. does not have a monopoly on innovative technologies. Congress can impose all the restrictions it wants on U.S. businesses. But, if America does not work with allies to enact similar controls, we will fail to protect both national security and our economic competitiveness.  In making his case to expand Cfius, Rep. Pittenger has misrepresented the facts. He cites examples of technology sold overseas by IBM and other companies that the U.S. government itself long ago ruled were nonsensitive and able to be freely sold around the world without a government license. In fact, everything IBM has done globally complies with U.S. and foreign export-control laws. For instance, sharing widely published, open-source software, or technology to assemble computer servers that are years behind state of the art, isn\u2019t threatening and therefore not legally controlled for export. But assisting with China\u2019s high-performance computing project is rightly prohibited by U.S. law, and the assertion that IBM has done so is flatly untrue.  Instead of putting thousands of nonsensitive transactions under review by a small committee that has neither the staff nor the experience to handle them, the better approach would be to update the export-control system we already have. A bipartisan bill introduced by Reps. Ed Royce and Eliot Engel, leaders of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, would modernize export controls to deal with emerging challenges.  Congress could also require that technology controls be kept up-to-date. The Departments of Commerce and State\u2014which are today responsible for administering controls on dual-use and military technologies\u2014have between them 500 experts, a transparent process of licensing and deep technical knowledge. But the Militarily Critical Technologies List, mandated by Congress as the baseline for what to control, hasn\u2019t been updated by the Defense Department since 2011.  As recent history has shown, controlling sensitive technology works best when done internationally, with a sharp focus on those technologies that are the most critical. Casting too broad a net on routine business risks losing focus on the real threats. Creating a new bureaucracy, instead of modernizing the one we already have, would be misguided.  Rep. Pittenger should get his facts straight. And Congress should act, both to improve Cfius and to update export controls, but it should use the proper tools for the proper job.  Christopher Padilla  IBM  Washington  Mr. Padilla is vice president for government and regulatory affairs at IBM. He was assistant secretary of commerce responsible for export controls from 2006-2007.  Rep. Pittenger\u2019s piece is premised on inaccurate claims about GE that undermine his arguments to reform government oversight of foreign acquisitions. We are a 125-year-old American company that has worked closely with the U.S. government and military for decades. Rep. Pettinger\u2019s insinuation that GE would compromise our national security to do business in China is offensive and untrue. While we, like many global companies, have joint ventures in China, all of them are consistent with U.S. law, and in many instances were established in close consultation with the U.S. government.  Rep. Pittenger never contacted GE to fact-check his allegations. In truth, GE supports Cfius reform, including strengthening the federal resources devoted to reviews of inbound investments and focusing the review on sectors of highest priority. What we don\u2019t support is the expansion of Cfius\u2019s jurisdiction to outbound U.S. investments into joint ventures around the world (not just in China). Doing so would set back both U.S. national security and economic interests, creating a new bureaucracy that is completely redundant with the existing U.S. export control system. It would generate thousands of additional cases for an already underresourced Cfius system, reduce the likelihood of a coordinated approach with our closest allies and needlessly damage American companies and their workers seeking to compete abroad.  Unfounded attacks like those made by Rep. Pittenger are unhelpful to the complex challenge the U.S. faces in safeguarding sensitive U.S. technology while enabling companies to compete in global markets.

Fourth-quarter revenue rose 3.6% to $22.54 billion. The last time IBM had revenue growth from the prior year was the first quarter of 2012, Ms. Rometty\u2019s first as chief.  Several factors drove growth in the latest quarter: sales of industrial-strength computers\u2014which the company typically refreshes every few years\u2014 rose 32% to $3.33 billion, while cloud-computing revenue climbed 30% to $5.5 billion. Also, currency exchange rates have been working in IBM\u2019s favor lately, accounting for 3 percentage points of the quarter\u2019s revenue growth after years of being a headwind.  IBM said it took a $5.5 billion charge related to the new U.S. tax law, helping to push it into the red for the period. Its tax rate, excluding the charge but including certain one-time benefits, was 6%.  In all, the company reported a fourth-quarter loss of $1.05 billion, or $1.14 a share, compared with profit of $4.5 billion, or $4.72 a share, a year earlier.  The loss stemmed partly from a deep erosion in profits in IBM\u2019s services business, showing IBM still has work to do. Pretax profit margins in the two services segments that manage large companies\u2019 software and hardware needs sank 35% and 23%, respectively, from a year ago. In its conference call with analysts, IBM described high investments and \u201clarge contract dynamics\u201d in those businesses.  Since becoming CEO, Ms. Rometty has struggled to shift IBM from older, shrinking businesses, such as selling and maintaining equipment in customers\u2019 own facilities, to newer ones that promise rapid growth.  She has staked out a position in helping large corporate customers integrate their traditional operations with cloud computing, and has focused on buzzy areas such as artificial intelligence and the Internet-based ledger technology known as blockchain.  But growth has been elusive, as even high-profile initiatives\u2014such as IBM\u2019s Watson AI, a collection of cloud tools as well as apps for industries including medicine and finance\u2014haven\u2019t delivered a clear financial boost.  Even some of Ms. Rometty\u2019s biggest fans have lost patience. IBM\u2019s largest and arguably most prominent stakeholder\u2014Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which invested more than $10 billion for a 5.4% stake in 2011\u2014sold more than half its holdings last year. Berkshire held about 37 million shares as of Sept. 30.  Shares of the 106-year-old tech company dropped 3.1% in after-hours trading after finishing Thursday\u2019s regular session with a marginal gain at $169.12. The price stands roughly where it did a year ago, while the S&P 500 index has risen more than 23%.  While achieving quarterly growth is noteworthy, IBM is working toward what it sees as a more significant milestone: getting more than half its revenue from so-called strategic imperatives \u2014 mostly newer technologies such as AI that customers can access in the cloud.  Revenue from strategic imperatives made up 49% of the total in the quarter, edging toward the point at which sales of the higher-growth offerings will outweigh the rest of IBM, heralding faster growth overall.  In an interview, James Kavanaugh, IBM\u2019s new finance chief, said the company is \u201cahead of track\u201d in working toward its goal of hitting an annual revenue rate of $40 billion for strategic imperatives by the end of this year.  \u201cThat gives us the confidence to say we\u2019re going to grow revenue overall in 2018,\u201d he said.  Jim Lebenthal, a portfolio manager at HPM Partners LLC, said there is evidence of Ms. Rometty\u2019s progress. He shed IBM in 2015 after \u201ca lot of disappointments\u201d but recently added the company to his stable of 20 stocks. He is betting IBM\u2019s newfound revenue growth is sustainable and that strategic imperatives will grow to more than 50% of sales in 2018.  When Ms. Rometty took the CEO reins from Samuel Palmisano in January 2012, revenue started slipping almost immediately and the threat of cloud computing to IBM\u2019s traditional businesses became evident. Ms. Rometty purchased cloud-computing platform SoftLayer Technologies Inc. the following year and committed to developing Watson into a flagship offering.  By 2014, it was clear IBM had diverged from Mr. Palmisano\u2019s financial road map for $20-a-share in profit by 2015. Ms. Rometty set aside that goal, reorganized the company around her strategic imperatives and redirected about $4 billion away from stock repurchases toward priorities such as Watson and the cloud, according to UBS AG analyst Steven Milunovich.  IBM\u2019s challenges now include holding on to its large customers as cloud leaders such as Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google beckon.  \u201cStrategic imperative revenue may cross over the core franchises later this year,\u201d Mr. Milunovich said, \u201cbut there are a lot of industry trends working against a large incumbent like IBM.\u201d  Hardware revenue rose 32%, driven by sales of mainframe computers\u2014on IBM\u2019s conference call with analysts, former finance chief Martin Schroeter called mainframes \u201can enduring and growing franchise\u201d\u2014which accounted for nearly 15% of total revenue in the quarter.  Those sales are critical, as they drive related sales of support services, software, storage and financing that historically have made up roughly 40% of IBM\u2019s operating profit, according to analyst Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein Research. They also can cement long-term customer relationships that drive recurring revenue such as software subscriptions, he said.  On an adjusted basis, which omits such items as acquisition- and retirement-related charges, IBM had profit of $5.18 a share, a penny more than the $5.17 expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters.  The Armonk, N.Y., company\u2019s guidance for 2018 called for operating earnings of $13.80 a share and free cash flow of about $12 billion.

IBM -0.86% is scheduled to announce fourth-quarter earnings after the market closes Thursday. Here\u2019s what to look for:  EARNINGS FORECAST: Analysts expect IBM to report earnings of $5.17 a share on an adjusted basis, which typically omits items such as acquisition- and retirement-related charges, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters. A year ago, IBM reported $5.01 in adjusted profit.  REVENUE FORECAST: Analysts expect total revenue of $22.05 billion for the quarter, up 1.3% from $21.77 billion a year earlier\u2014what would be the first growth after 22 consecutive quarters of declines.  WHAT TO WATCH:  GROWTH, BUT FOR HOW LONG?: One quarter of growth after more than five years of declines doesn\u2019t make a trend, some analysts caution. Fourth-quarter revenue was bolstered by two key factors, they say. First, foreign-exchange rates lately have shifted in IBM\u2019s favor after years of cutting into financial performance. They likely accounted for roughly 3% of revenue in the quarter, said Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein Research. Second, Q4 was the first full period that included sales of IBM\u2019s latest industrial-strength computers that process transactions for retailers, banks and the like. The mainframes, which IBM typically introduces every few years, typically boost revenue across several business lines. That effect is cyclical and bound to taper after a few quarters, Mr. Sacconaghi said.  SERVICES AHEAD: Knowing an eventual drop-off in mainframe revenue is down the line, investors will be looking for other areas to pick up the slack. IBM\u2019s two services segments, which include its consulting, IT hardware and software services and cloud operations, typically account for roughly 65% of total revenue. Both declined in recent quarters. \u201cFor IBM to get to revenue stability, which is what really matters for the stock multiple, services have to improve,\u201d said David Grossman of Stifel Financial Corp.  TAX IMPACT: Analysts are struggling to evaluate precisely how the U.S. tax-reform bill recently passed by Congress will affect IBM. The company has said its aggregate tax rate is around 15%, plus or minus 3 percentage points, but some analysts believe the new law may push it as high as 20%. The company held around $71 billion in cash overseas at the end of 2016, said Steve Milunovich of UBS AG , and repatriating some of that money could eat into earnings. IBM hasn\u2019t yet said what it expects to do with its stockpile in light of the new U.S. tax law.

The Senate and House, with the backing of the White House, are working on bipartisan legislation to broaden the authority of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., a multi-agency body that has oversight of deals that could lead to the transfer of sensitive technology to rival countries. The current CFIUS statute doesn\u2019t single out any country, but in recent years, the committee has often been focused on deals involving China.  Currently, CFIUS can recommend the president block foreign entities from buying majority stakes in U.S. companies; the new bill would let the committee make similar recommendations for deals involving minority investments and joint ventures, along with transactions that it determines involve \u201cemerging technologies.\u201d  The scope of the proposed legislation is broad. China requires foreign investors to form ventures with local partners, and Washington law firms say they are receiving a surge in inquiries over what it might mean for the large number of U.S. firms active in China. The country\u2019s huge size has made it a market of interest for companies ranging from auto makers like General Motors Corp. , technology companies like Cisco Systems Inc. or other manufacturers like Caterpillar Inc. \u2014all of which have local ventures in China.  It isn\u2019t clear how broadly the new law would be enforced. For now, the most vocal corporate opponents are a handful of U.S. companies that have determined the new law might crimp business prospects by requiring companies to get the blessing of CFIUS for some joint ventures that involve shared U.S. technology.  IBM Corp. , for instance, last year agreed with China\u2019s Wanda Internet Technology to share the cloud computing technology used in its Watson artificial intelligence system. Behind the strategy is the belief that embedding IBM\u2019s technology in China\u2019s business infrastructure would steer Chinese customers toward IBM as they seek future growth.  Other large U.S. corporations, from General Electric Co. to Microsoft Corp. , see China as a crucial market for similar reasons.  IBM, among others, has said the bill\u2014known as the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act\u2014would hurt U.S. companies\u2019 ability to compete globally. \u201cForeign competitors that do not face similar regulatory restrictions will seize global market opportunities while American companies are left watching from the sidelines,\u201d IBM\u2019s vice president of government and regulatory affairs, Christopher Padilla, testified at a recent Senate hearing.  Supporters of the bill, who think it could be signed into law later this year, aren\u2019t convinced. \u201cI am concerned that some of the recent witnesses before the House and Senate have major financial conflicts of interest that prohibit an objective evaluation of the security threats we face,\u201d Rep. Robert Pittenger (R., N.C.)\u2014one of the drafters of the bill\u2014said in an email.  \u201cThe business models for IBM, Microsoft, and GE, for example, have led to the transfer of military applicable technologies to China that have likely aided the modernization of the Chinese military and intelligence agencies,\u201d said Mr. Pittenger. The bill\u2019s supporters say it complements and strengthens export regulations rather than duplicating them.  IBM and other opponents, while acknowledging national-security concerns, have suggested existing export controls to counter China rather than expanding the reach of CFIUS. IBM didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.  In an email, GE said while it supports the idea of changes to CFIUS, \u201cit\u2019s also important that any reform support America\u2019s historical leadership in attracting foreign investment, not duplicate existing and well-established export control regimes, and preserve the ability of American companies to compete globally.\u201d The company declined an interview. Microsoft declined to comment.  Several security experts say China has been sidestepping controls by taking minority stakes in U.S. technology companies or entering joint licensing ventures.  \u201cThere\u2019s a very sophisticated and well-organized plan [by China] to acquire the technology and the reality is there are people here who want to sell it,\u201d said William Reinsch, who was the Commerce Department\u2019s undersecretary for export administration under President Bill Clinton.  And for many who have watched China easily avail itself of gaps in the CFIUS review process, the bill is the minimum that can be done in a fight that is likely to get much bigger. CFIUS blocked 10 deals between 2014 and 2016 over national-security concerns; China in recent years has accounted for the largest number of reviewed transactions.  \u201cThere\u2019s a big trade war shootout coming up with China that I think, frankly, is overdue,\u201d said Adm. Dennis Blair, co-chair of the Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property and a former U.S. director of national intelligence. He said among the key technologies right now are those involving artificial intelligence, data mining and pattern recognition.  How Bill Would Broaden CFIUS\u2019s Reach Expands CFIUS\u2019s jurisdiction to partnerships where a foreign firm doesn\u2019t have a controlling interest, such as joint ventures, minority investments and licensing deals.  Adds ability to review real-estate purchases or leases near military bases or other sensitive U.S. government properties.  Updates CFIUS\u2019s definition of \u201ccritical technologies\u201d to include emerging technologies that could be essential for maintaining U.S. technological advantage over countries that pose threats to national security.  Makes a filing mandatory if the partnership involves a state-owned enterprise.  Expands CFIUS\u2019s ability to revisit earlier transactions.

Source: Proposed Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2017  Supporters point to recent deals that they say deserve greater scrutiny because they give China access to critical technology, such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc.\u2019s 2016 joint venture with China\u2019s Tianjin Haiguang Advanced Technology Investment Co., which gave the company access to technology similar to that used by Intel Corp. in its chips. Tianjin Haiguang didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.  AMD spokesman Drew Prairie said in an email that \u201csome commentators have mischaracterized\u201d the venture and that AMD received a \u201cU.S. government classification confirming that the technology was not restricted for export\u201d\u2014a reference to Commerce Department export controls. As for the CFIUS overhaul bill, Mr. Prairie said AMD supports strengthened security but wants to make sure it doesn\u2019t have \u201cunintended consequences.\u201d Dawning Information Industry Co. , the largest shareholder of Tianjin Haiguang, didn\u2019t respond to an email.  Many businesses are also supportive of the bill, including software maker Oracle Corp. , telecommunications firm Ericsson Inc., steelmaker Nucor Corp. and railroad-car-equipment maker Greenbrier Co s. Many say an expanded CFIUS would set needed ground rules for working with Chinese firms.  Even openly supporting the bill, some companies worry, could expose them to problems\u2014not in the U.S. but in China. They don\u2019t want to be blocked from entering deals in China, or prevented from selling products in its booming economy.  \u201cWe\u2019re quiet about our support because of fear of retaliation,\u201d said an executive at a large U.S. technology company.  \u2014Kersten Zhang and Ted Greenwald contributed to this article.

One employee planning to depart\u2014a 47-year-old who has been with the car maker for a decade\u2014said Peugeot is offering him \u20ac10,500 ($12,950) to retrain. He wants to become a teacher.  \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten to a point where the company is no longer right for me, and I\u2019m no longer right for the company,\u201d he said. \u201cBetter a good divorce than a bad marriage.\u201d  Mr. Macron\u2019s approach could backfire, however, if companies use the new measures to cut staff without hiring new ones. France\u2019s economy is finally in recovery, with latest figures showing unemployment at the end of 2017 at 8.9%, its lowest level since early 2009. But Mr. Macron remains under pressure to bring that rate down further, and the country\u2019s powerful unions have their guard up against any evidence that the rules could cost jobs rather than create them.  Foreign businesses that have typically viewed France as a sinkhole for investment are also watching closely. Labor lawyers in Paris are already fielding calls from firms in the U.S. and elsewhere that \u201care interested in the possibility of moving fast in a consensual framework that isn\u2019t traumatic for their teams,\u201d said Claire Toumieux, a partner at law firm Allen & Overy.  IBM, based in Armonk, New York, plans to \u201chire aggressively in key skills areas\u201d in France in parallel to conducting layoffs using the new rules, a company spokeswoman said.  In September, Mr. Macron decreed myriad changes, including capping court-ordered fines for dismissals and giving companies greater powers to negotiate working conditions with employees. One part of the broad package is a measure that absolves companies from using lengthy, complex procedures for voluntary layoffs.  A broken window at a Paris branch of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale after a march in November against the French government\u2019s overhaul of labor laws. Photo: Michel Stoupak/NurPhoto/ZUMA Press  Previously a firm had to prove it was in financial difficulty before embarking on layoffs, even on a voluntary basis. Publicly traded firms were loath to declare they were struggling. Penalties for missteps in the procedure were high, and a company could ultimately be forced to hire back staff who left.  The new rules allow employers to instead negotiate a rupture conventionnelle collective\u2014a voluntary severance agreement for large numbers of employees\u2014regardless of the company\u2019s health.  \u201cIt\u2019s a complete change in philosophy,\u201d said David Jonin, a partner specializing in employment law at Gide Loyrette Nouel.  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale plans to use the measure to restructure its retail operations. As customers shift to online services, the bank is scrambling to close 300 of its 2,000 retail branches in France and automate 80% of the processes linking front and back offices. The plan, dubbed \u201cTransform to Grow,\u201d will entail 3,450 job cuts from its retail network between 2016 and 2020, the bank said in November.  Many of those cuts were expected to take place through attrition or the redeployment of staff to other units of the bank, but last month the bank disclosed it would also make use of the new rules.  Balancing Act Peugeot is using President Macron's labor measures to slash jobs this year and soften the blow with new recruits. 3,000 Apprentices 2,000 2,000 1,000 New hires  1,300  0  Layoffs  \u20131,000  1,300  Early  retirement  \u20132,000  900  \u20133,000  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale has scheduled talks with unions for later this month. Under the Macron law, any firm that wants to adopt the new scheme needs to win over a majority of its union representatives. In some cases that has emerged as a significant obstacle.  \u201cManagement is going too fast. When you want to get rid of so many jobs, you\u2019ve got to explain why,\u201d said Monique Motsch, a representative of the moderate CFDT union at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.  At French clothing retailer Pimkie, unions already shot down a Jan. 9 proposal to apply the new process, forcing the company to revert to France\u2019s older, more onerous system requiring the firm to show itself as being in financial distress.  Peugeot, in contrast, secured the support of its unions in a matter of days. The car maker threaded the needle by sweetening the layoff offers and combining them with 900 early-retirement offers and a plan to recruit and train higher-skilled employees. That includes 1,300 new positions and 2,000 apprentices.  \u201cPsychologically it\u2019s softer. There\u2019s no obligation to leave, everything is voluntary and it protects workers who want to stay,\u201d said Jean-Francois Kondratiuk, an employee representative who sits on Peugeot\u2019s supervisory board.  Workers who choose to stay at Peugeot are accepting more flexibility. Jean-Louis Thirot, 50, has agreed to train for a new job testing software for car electronics. The research center in the west of Paris where he currently works ordering parts is shutting down this year.  \u201cI\u2019m able to succeed because I can move internally,\u201d said Mr. Thirot, who has worked for Peugeot for more than three decades.  Others say they have recognized that a job at Peugeot is no longer the safe bet it once was. A 40-year-old technician whose father, brother and wife have all worked for the car maker said he thought he had a job for life when he joined the company in 2003. Now that Peugeot has outsourced nearly all of his department\u2019s work, he has decided to take the severance package.  \u201cI\u2019m the last of the Mohicans,\u201d he said.

Robert Pittenger\u2019s \u201cHow China Pushes the Limits on Military Technology Transfer\u201d (WSJ.com op-ed, March 14): Few Americans would argue against measures to make this country more secure, and most would agree that protecting national security requires the proper tools. Still, many more would agree that being factual when discussing this topic is absolutely critical.  Legislation recently introduced in Congress and advocated in these pages by Rep. Robert Pittenger would make some needed improvements to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (Cfius). For example, the measure would expand the ability of the government to block the purchase of buildings or other real estate near military installations.  But Mr. Pittenger\u2019s bill\u2014the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act\u2014goes much, much farther. It would drastically expand the mission of Cfius, an interagency committee staffed by fewer than a dozen people at the Treasury Department, bringing under government review countless international sales and licensing transactions by U.S. companies.  The new remit of Cfius would include such things as standard computer service and support contracts, technology manuals needed to operate machinery purchased by foreign customers and even the licensing of trademarks. Technologies that never were deemed sensitive by the Defense Department or that were long ago removed from control by the U.S. and its allies would be subject to new and opaque regulation by Cfius.  More concerning is that Mr. Pittenger\u2019s bill would do all of this unilaterally\u2014without any effort at cooperation with our allies. The U.S. does not have a monopoly on innovative technologies. Congress can impose all the restrictions it wants on U.S. businesses. But, if America does not work with allies to enact similar controls, we will fail to protect both national security and our economic competitiveness.  In making his case to expand Cfius, Rep. Pittenger has misrepresented the facts. He cites examples of technology sold overseas by IBM and other companies that the U.S. government itself long ago ruled were nonsensitive and able to be freely sold around the world without a government license. In fact, everything IBM has done globally complies with U.S. and foreign export-control laws. For instance, sharing widely published, open-source software, or technology to assemble computer servers that are years behind state of the art, isn\u2019t threatening and therefore not legally controlled for export. But assisting with China\u2019s high-performance computing project is rightly prohibited by U.S. law, and the assertion that IBM has done so is flatly untrue.  Instead of putting thousands of nonsensitive transactions under review by a small committee that has neither the staff nor the experience to handle them, the better approach would be to update the export-control system we already have. A bipartisan bill introduced by Reps. Ed Royce and Eliot Engel, leaders of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, would modernize export controls to deal with emerging challenges.  Congress could also require that technology controls be kept up-to-date. The Departments of Commerce and State\u2014which are today responsible for administering controls on dual-use and military technologies\u2014have between them 500 experts, a transparent process of licensing and deep technical knowledge. But the Militarily Critical Technologies List, mandated by Congress as the baseline for what to control, hasn\u2019t been updated by the Defense Department since 2011.  As recent history has shown, controlling sensitive technology works best when done internationally, with a sharp focus on those technologies that are the most critical. Casting too broad a net on routine business risks losing focus on the real threats. Creating a new bureaucracy, instead of modernizing the one we already have, would be misguided.  Rep. Pittenger should get his facts straight. And Congress should act, both to improve Cfius and to update export controls, but it should use the proper tools for the proper job.

One of the most important such lenses is the impact of IT on business processes, that is, on how work is actually done across the various functions of an organization.  IT-driven business process has gone through three distinct phases. First came process automation in the early years of IT, where companies automated and improved their existing processes while leaving the underlying structure of the organization in place. Then came enterprise-wide process reengineering and management, where the job was to redesign the flow of work and integrate management of the various process within the enterprise. The third phase is now starting, focused on the processes and transactions that determine how institutions interact with each other around the world. Here, blockchain is set to play a role.  Automation, reengineering and integrated management of business processes have had a major impact on lowering the costs and improving the efficiency of transactions within a firm. But as we well know, the internet and globalization have significantly increased the volume of transactions and other interactions taking place among institutions around the world. The processes to manage the conduct of business among companies have not kept up with the economy\u2019s digital transformation, adding significant frictions and costs to their operations.  According to a 2016 IBM report, three major types of frictions predominate when conducting business among different institutions:  Information frictions: Participants in a transaction don\u2019t have access to the same information; the required information is not easily accessible; and security and privacy risks keep rising, \u2013 e.g., hacking, cybercrime, identity theft.  Interaction frictions: Intermediaries are needed to help deal with growing scale and complexity; transactions take longer due to arcane global processes; and a lack of trusted marketplaces in many economies around the world.  Innovation frictions: These include legacy systems, bureaucratic processes and institutional inertia; restrictive regulations that stifle innovation and change; and growing uncertainties and threats that make it harder to move forward.  Blockchains have the potential to significantly reduce these various frictions by bringing one of the most important and oldest concepts, the ledger, to the internet age. Ledgers constitute a permanent record of all the economic transactions an institution handles, whether it\u2019s a bank managing deposits, loans and payments; a brokerage house keeping track of stocks and bonds; a global company conducting business with its supply chain partners; or a government office recording births and deaths, the ownership and sale of land and houses, or legal identity documents like passports and driver licenses.  \u201cToday, transactions are recorded in multiple ledgers,\u201d noted the IBM report. \u201cEach one captures at best a moment in time and reflects the information held by a single party: Bank X purchased or sold a mortgage, for example. They don\u2019t record what happens next, what came before, or the role of others \u2013 partners, suppliers, consumers \u2013 in the transaction. Moreover, they\u2019re prone to human error and vulnerable to tampering. By contrast, distributed ledgers can be shared and updated in near real-time across a group of participants.\u201d  Blockchain technologies hold great promise for global supply chains ecosystems by increasing the speed, security and accuracy of financial and commercial settlements; tracking the supply chain lifecycle of any component or product; and securely protecting all the transactions and data moving through the supply chain. Blockchains provide an immutable, non-revocable record of all the transactions through the entire supply chain cycle, which will be of great help in the timely resolution of errors or disputes among supply chain partners.  In August, 2016 the World Economic Forum published an excellent report on The future of financial infrastructure, an ambitious look at how blockchain can reshape financial services. The report noted that blockchain technologies have the potential to transform the infrastructure and processes of the financial industry, bringing a diverse range of benefits including operational simplification, near-real time settlements among institutions, more accurate regulatory compliance and liquidity and capital improvements.  However, the report also warned that the evolution towards such a blockchain-based financial infrastructure and processes will take considerable time because it must overcome significant challenges. In particular, it will require the close collaborations of its various stakeholders around the world \u2014 including financial institutions, merchants and governments\u2013to develop the appropriate legal and regulatory frameworks.  This emerging third phase in the evolution of business process transformation is both promising and challenging, as we once more apply IT to make economies more efficient, this time involving the interactions of institutions and industries all around the world.

Photo: Akos Stiller/Bloomberg News  Nvidia NVDA -1.32% may have only high-quality problems these days, but it still needs to solve them.  One problem the chip maker has is that it seems to be selling all the chips it can make. Nvidia\u2019s graphics processors, also called GPUs, are in hot demand by everyone from giant tech companies building data centers to videogamers to cryptocurrency enthusiasts. The latter two in particular are competing for the type of GPU cards used in supercharged PCs, causing a shortage that began last summer but seemed to have worsened later in the year as the value of cryptocurrencies continued to soar.  That gave a boost to what was already a strong year for Nvidia. Revenue from the company\u2019s gaming segment jumped 33% to a record $5.5 billion for the fiscal year ended Jan. 28. This included an unspecified contribution from crypto demand, as well as the chips the company sells to Nintendo that are used in its popular Switch console. Nvidia is a \u201cfabless\u201d chip company that outsources the actual manufacturing of its chips to others. CEO Jensen Huang said on the company\u2019s earnings call Thursday that it is working with its partners to \u201ccatch up to that demand.\u201d The recently ended fiscal year was the company\u2019s best ever. Sales jumped 41% to a record $9.7 billion, while operating income surged 66% to $3.2 billion\u2014another record. The company\u2019s operating margin for the year was also at a record high 33%, compared with 28% the previous year. Data center sales, representing chips sold to companies such as Google, Amazon and Microsoft to establish artificial intelligence capabilities in their networks, more than doubled during the year. That means Nvidia\u2019s main \u201cproblem\u201d for the year ahead is how to improve on perfection. Chances are that it can. Capital spending on data centers is expected to continue growing in the double-digit range this year. Gaming demand will remain strong as well, particularly with Nintendo boosting production of the Switch. Crypto is a wild card, with the value of those currencies swinging wildly of late, but Nvidia is wisely cautious about those customers, maintaining its focus on its gamer base and the burgeoning data center opportunity. Still, the company has a lot to live up to. Its stock defied Friday\u2019s turbulence to pick up 7% after already having surged nearly 90% in the previous 12 months. Nvidia\u2019s market value is now ahead of that of IBM \u2019s , with the shares fetching 37 times forward earnings. High expectations can set up disappointments down the road. Still, there are worse problems to have.

IBM is one of the big tech companies exploring ethical standards to guide the development of artificial intelligence. Photo: brian snyder/Reuters  WASHINGTON\u2014Technology companies are racing to get ahead of regulators to shape the future of artificial intelligence as it moves deeper into our daily lives.  Companies are already working artificial intelligence, or AI, into their business models, but the technology remains controversial. So IBM Corp. , Intel Corp. and associations representing Apple Inc., Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google unit are seeking to set ethical standards, or a sort of code of conduct, through alliances with futurists, civil-rights activists and social scientists.  Critics, however, see it as an effort to blunt outside regulation by cities, states or the federal government, and they question if tech companies are best suited to shape the rules of the road. For the corporations, the algorithms will be proprietary tools to assess your loan-worthiness, your job application, and your risk of stroke. Many balk at the costs of developing systems that not only learn to make decisions, but that also explain those decisions to outsiders.  When New York City proposed a law in August requiring that companies publish source code for algorithms used by city agencies, tech firms pushed back, saying they needed to protect proprietary algorithms. The city passed a scaled-back version in December without the source-code requirement.  \u201cThey\u2019re hiding behind trade secrets so you can\u2019t even get a look at what people are doing,\u201d said Ryan Calo, a University of Washington law professor who has advised Congress members on AI issues.  AI, broadly speaking, refers to computers mimicking intelligent behavior, crunching big data to make judgments on anything from avoiding car accidents to where the next crime might happen.  Yet computer algorithms aren\u2019t always clear on their logic. If a computer consistently denies a loan to members of a certain sex or race, is that discrimination? Will regulators have the right to examine the algorithm that made the decision? What if the algorithm doesn\u2019t know how to explain itself?  From the Archives Executives from Baidu, Intel, Samsung and Walmart talk about how artificial intelligence will soon redefine our technological lives. They speak at the WSJ D.Live conference in Laguna Beach, Calif. (Originally published Oct. 18, 2017)  The Obama administration sought to address these issues. Under Mr. Obama, the Office of Science and Technology Policy issued white papers on the ethical implications on AI. Under Mr. Trump, the office still doesn\u2019t have a director, and its staff is down to about 45, from about 130. A spokesman for the office declined to comment.  For now, the Trump administration has signaled it wants business to take the lead. The administration is worried overarching regulation could constrain innovation and make the U.S. less competitive, Michael Kratsios, the deputy in charge of tech policy at the Office of Science and Technology Policy, said at a conference in February. He noted China\u2019s push into artificial intelligence, which it is doing without much ethical quibbling.  \u201cWe\u2019re not looking for, or will be endorsing, broad, high level guidelines about AI rules,\u201d Mr. Kratsios said. He called it \u201ckey\u201d to create \u201cthe regulatory environment that ensures that the next great technologies happen here in the U.S.\u201d  In the past six months, Intel, IBM, Workday Inc. and the Washington, D.C.-based Information Technology Industry Council\u2014whose members include Facebook, Apple and Google\u2014all issued principles on the ethical use of artificial intelligence. In January, Microsoft Corp. put out an entire book on \u201cArtificial Intelligence and its Role in Society.\u201d  In 2016, some of the biggest tech companies founded an ethics-setting organization called the Partnership on Artificial Intelligence to Benefit People and Society, based in San Francisco. There are many others with at least some industry funding, including Open AI, the AI Now Institute, doteveryone, and the Center for Democracy & Technology.  Proposed rules have ranged from specific guidelines for government use, to requirements that any algorithm be able to explain its process to consumers. Many would apply existing regulations to AI case-by-case, adapting aviation rules to drones or applying privacy protections to personal data in algorithms.  Setting rules is complicated because companies often can\u2019t explain how their more complex systems, called \u201cdeep neural networks,\u201d arrive at answers. Last year, University of Washington researchers reported that an algorithm that had learned\u2014by itself\u2014to distinguish between wolves and husky dogs appeared to be doing so by noticing snow on the ground in the wolf pictures, not because of any insight into the animal.  \u201cGoogle, Facebook, those guys are very interested in performance and making these programs as smart as they can,\u201d said Dave Gunning, who leads a project into making algorithms explain their processes for the government\u2019s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.  \u201cExplainability is not as important to them,\u201d Mr. Gunning said. Google and Facebook didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.  At least one business executive, Elon Musk, founder and chief executive of Tesla Inc. and SpaceX, has cut back his role in the ethical research group he co-founded, Open AI. Mr. Musk quit the group\u2019s board in February. The group said he wanted to \u201celiminate a potential future conflict of interest\u201d with his role at Tesla, which is developing AI systems. He remains an Open AI adviser and funder.  Some in Congress are taking up the ethical debate. Washington Sen. Maria Cantwell and Maryland Rep. John Delaney, both Democrats, led a bipartisan bill introduced in December to establish a federal advisory council on the technology\u2019s potential impact. There is also an AI caucus on the Hill, started in may, and committees have been holding hearings on AI, algorithms and autonomous vehicles. The European Union has already set regulations for AI algorithms, that are set to take effect in May.  Human-resources software maker Workday, which uses Ai algorithms, assumes that either now, or sometime soon, the U.S. will start to set guidelines.  \u201cOur engagement now is in anticipation that one day there will be government regulation related to AI,\u201d said senior vice president Jim Shaughnessy. He said Workday wants to \u201censure a regulatory framework that serves society\u2019s needs while allowing the potential of AI, and its benefits, to flourish.\u201d", "stock": "IBM", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-13", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/artificial-intelligence-rules-more-of-your-life-who-rules-ai-1520933401"}, {"article": "Humanoid robots are getting better at walking, talking and looking like humans.

Oxford Economics, a forecasting and consulting firm, estimates the legislation will contribute 0.4 percentage points to already-robust economic growth in 2018, and another 0.1 to 0.2 points in 2019, said Gregory Daco, head of U.S. economics for the consultancy.  About half of that is likely to come from business spending, and the rest from households, Mr. Daco said. Oxford estimates that each $1 of corporate tax cut will lead to 40 cents of spending, based on historical precedent, Congressional Budget Office studies and conversations with corporate executives.  That\u2019s mostly a one-time gain. A reduction in taxes frees up profits to spend, but that then becomes the new normal, with further growth coming from general economic expansion or other factors.  At Amicus Therapeutics, the new tax law solved a geographic dilemma. The Cranbury, N.J., company is developing an experimental drug to treat Pompe disease, a rare inherited disorder that causes muscle weakness and can be fatal.  After early results for a new drug proved promising, Amicus wanted to increase production for further clinical testing and potential commercial sales.  Amicus, which has been using Chinese contract manufacturer WuXi Biologics to supply the drug, decided in August to build its own facility. The U.S. was at a disadvantage to Europe, due to its 35% statutory federal income-tax rate for companies. Ireland\u2019s corporate tax rate, by contrast, is 12.5%.  Those financial considerations threatened to overshadow other advantages that a U.S. plant would offer, including the ease with which company officials could visit it, and the availability of talented workers in some regions.  \u201cOur strong assumption was that it would be very challenging to establish a new bio-manufacturing facility in the U.S.,\u201d Chief Executive John Crowley said in an interview.  As the tax legislation advanced in Congress last fall, however, building in the U.S. began to look more attractive. On Dec. 21, a day after Congress passed the final measure, which lowered the statutory corporate rate to 21%, Mr. Crowley recommended to his board the company focus on finding a U.S. site. The company has narrowed its choice to three East Coast cities Mr. Crowley declined to identify, and expects to decide in the next month or two. It expects the plant to cost $150 million to $200 million, and to employ at least 200 people at an average pay of $100,000 a year.  Amicus Therapeutics Chief Executive John Crowley, right, chose the U.S. over Europe for a new production facility. Photo: Melissa Golden for The Wall Street Journal  \u201cWith the changes in the tax law, it now makes the U.S. competitive with these geographies we\u2019re looking at,\u201d he said.  The rules of deal making, too, are changing. In the past two months, Aramark completed two acquisitions with a price tag of $2.35 billion as it snapped up hotel procurement and supply firm Avendra in December and uniform-rental and linen-supply firm AmeriPride Services Inc. last week.  Both are a kind of deal that, thanks to the new tax law, has become cheaper. One provision lets companies deduct the cost of buying some sorts of assets immediately, instead of over several years as prior tax law required\u2014and expanded this treatment to used assets as well as new ones.  That essentially lets a buyer like Aramark get an immediate discount on the cash cost of part of its deals, the portion that reflects the acquisition of equipment, machinery and other tangible property.  Aramark\u2019s acquisition of Avendra, a partnership, is automatically treated as an asset purchase, New York tax consultant Robert Willens notes, while deal documents indicate Aramark and AmeriPride agreed to treat that acquisition as an asset purchase as well for tax purposes. (Although the Avendra deal closed in December, the new tax treatment applies to assets acquired after late September.)  \u201cThe cost of deals structured in this manner have taken a turn for the better,\u201d Mr. Willens said. \u201cYou\u2019re getting a full 21% discount.\u201d  In news releases, Aramark described its after-tax cost for the two deals as $1.86 billion, 21% less than the pretax price. Aramark said in a statement that it continues to evaluate the impact of the new tax law with accounting firm KPMG LLP, and plans to update investors on the acquisitions when it reports quarterly earnings on Feb. 6.  The same provision, speeding up tax deductions for capital spending, has prompted Kimberly-Clark, the diaper- and tissue-maker, to accelerate at least one major project, CEO Tom Falk said. The company\u2019s board votes next month on a U.S. factory retooling expected to cost hundreds of millions of dollars. There wasn\u2019t a timeline for the project previously.  \u201cIt gives us more incentive to invest, particularly in the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Falk said in an interview. \u201cThe project made sense before the tax benefit. It makes more sense after the tax benefit.\u201d  Similar reconsiderations are under way elsewhere. At United Natural Foods Inc., a grocery distributor with about 10,000 employees and more than $9 billion in annual revenue, the tax law has prompted a wholesale re-evaluation.  Projects previously viewed as risky are being given new consideration, Mike Zechmeister, the company\u2019s finance chief, said in an interview. The return on investment improved by 4 percentage points on a warehousing project in the Pacific region of the U.S. that the company had already decided to pursue, he said, primarily because of the new lower tax rate.  \u201cIt\u2019s going to impact all the decisions we make,\u201d Mr. Zechmeister said. \u201cAlmost all investments look better from an investment standpoint because we won\u2019t have to pay as much tax.\u201d  Grocery distributor United Natural Foods Inc. is investing to overcome capacity bottlenecks. Photo: United Natural Foods  The tax break comes at a particularly good time for United Natural Foods, which has struggled to keep pace with surging demand for natural and organic goods. The company\u2019s net sales rose 8% year-over-year during its last quarter to $2.5 billion, driven largely by Whole Foods, the chain acquired by Amazon.com Inc . last year and United Natural\u2019s biggest customer.  That sudden growth proved costly. The Providence, R.I., company had an additional $25 million in lost sales from out-of-stock goods during its last quarter, along with higher labor costs and storage fees. Any expansion would help ease capacity bottlenecks that the company intends to resolve in coming months.  Some companies are holding pat, either because they want to see how the new rules shake out, or because they are worried about moving too fast.  Verizon said it would use most of its tax savings\u2014$3.5 billion to $4 billion in extra cash in 2018\u2014to pay down some of its $117 billion debt, rather than increase investments. It will also donate to its charity and give employees company stock.  Mr. McAdam, the Verizon CEO, said the wireless giant would remain disciplined about capital spending. \u201cIt\u2019s very inconsistent that just because tax reform comes through, we are all of a sudden going to draw the line at a different place or lose that discipline,\u201d he said on Tuesday.  Several firms have announced plans to plow most of their tax savings into dividends or share repurchases, about a third of which flow to foreign investors, by some estimates.  Bank of America Corp. is exploring how it might invest in branches, technology and its workforce, CEO Brian Moynihan told investors last week. \u201cHowever, to be clear, we\u2019d expect most of the benefits from tax reform will flow to the bottom line through dividends and share buybacks over time,\u201d he added. A spokesman said payouts to shareholders will also help local economies.  The tax overhaul is altering corporate operations in sometimes surprising ways. Netflix Inc., for example, has changed the compensation it will pay three of its top officers, raising their salaries by a combined $19 million.  Its reasoning: The new tax law prevents companies from deducting any sort of pay over $1 million apiece for key executives. Prior law allowed companies to deduct that pay if it was tied to performance. So, having lost the benefit of a tax deduction for paying performance-based bonuses instead of salary, Netflix announced days after the tax law was passed that its board was scrapping the performance measures and converting the pay into straight salary instead, as it used to do before 2014.  The tax-law change is likely to eliminate tax deductions on $92 billion of pay, according to an analysis of Russell 3000 firms by Equilar. Several large companies\u2014including Johnson Controls International PLC and drugmaker AmerisourceBergen Corp. \u2014have said their boards are considering how the tax change affects their approach to compensation. Willis Towers Watson , a compensation-consulting firm, found that 40% of 333 employers it surveyed were either considering executive-pay changes or had already made some.  The ripple effects are hitting small businesses, too. Matthew Wells, president of Western Mechanical Contractors Inc. in Federal Way, Wash., is considering whether to restructure how his business is organized to maximize his benefits under the new tax law.  The 32-person plumbing and mechanical contracting firm is currently set up as an S corporation, a so-called pass-through structure in which the business itself isn\u2019t taxed and its income goes to the owners, who reflect it on their individual tax returns.  Mr. Wells is trying to determine whether his tax bill would fall if he switched to a C corporation, which pays its own income taxes directly to the Internal Revenue Service\u2014now at a 21% rate, down from a top rate of 35% before the new law.  Mr. Wells\u2019 accountant is still poring over the new law, but has suggested the potential benefits may not be as great as the contractor initially believed. \u201cI think they are going to try and talk us out of it,\u201d said Mr. Wells. \u201cBut it is certainly something we are looking into.\u201d  Christmas may be over but WSJ\u2019s Richard Rubin keeps the holiday spirit alive by explaining who\u2019s getting presents and who\u2019s getting coal with the GOP tax bill.  \u2014Sharon Terlep, Ruth Simon and Ryan Knutson contributed to this article.

Blockchain has the power to transform all these industries for three reasons. First, it\u2019s genuinely well-suited to transactions that require trust and a permanent record. Second, blockchain typically requires the cooperation of many different parties. In cases where it\u2019s implemented as open source software, it avoids the collective-action problem\u2014the disincentives that prevent individuals from adopting something that would benefit them collectively\u2014that occurs when a single company tries to push, and benefit from, a new standard.  The third reason is that hype I mentioned. The current excitement around cryptocurrency gives blockchain the visibility to attract developers and encourage adoption. Companies that have taken an \u201cIf it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it\u201d attitude toward back-office processes and logistics IT might be ready to spend big on updating those systems when they hear the buzzword \u201cblockchain.\u201d  In this way, blockchain resembles another buzzword, \u201cthe cloud.\u201d While detractors argued that the cloud was just \u201csomeone else\u2019s computer,\u201d it gave many industries new business processes, new ways to charge for services, disruptive startups and new divisions within existing companies and an ecosystem of supporting technologies. Blockchain has the same potential.  Blockchain All the Things  Take logistics. Already, 1.1 million items sold or on sale at Walmart are on a blockchain\u2014including chicken and almond milk\u2014helping the company trace their journey from manufacturer to store shelf. Global shipping giant Maersk uses the same technology from IBM to track shipping containers, making it faster and easier to transfer them and get them through customs.  While these projects are still a fraction of the overall tracking that goes on at these giants, they are expanding rapidly both within the organizations and across their industries. Other companies using blockchain technology to track goods include Kroger, Nestl\u00e9, Tyson Foods and Unilever, with many more yet to be announced, says Bridget van Kralingen, senior vice president of platforms and blockchain at IBM.  Everledger, a company started in April 2014 with the intention of creating a blockchain-based registry of every certified diamond in the world, already has 2.2 million diamonds in its registry. It\u2019s adding about 100,000 diamonds a month, says Leanne Kemp, chief executive and founder.  Related Blockchain May Offer a R\u00e9sum\u00e9 You Can Trust  By recording 40 different measures of each stone, including \u201cphysically unclone-able features,\u201d Everledger is able to trace the journey of a stone from when it\u2019s pulled from the earth to the day it\u2019s purchased by a consumer. Every participant in that chain, from the miner to the cutter to the retailer, maintains a node\u2014with a complete copy of the database\u2014in the Everledger blockchain network.  Global shipping giant Maersk uses blockchain technology from IBM to track and transfer shipping containers and move them more quickly through customs. Photo: Susana Gonzalez/Bloomberg  CartaSense is an eight-year-old Tel Aviv company that puts internet-connected sensors on freight pallets and uses analytics to determine when goods may be delayed or damaged. CartaSense customers, rather than physically handing off scanned and signed paper documents, use a blockchain database on which freight companies can record every stage of the journey of a package, pallet or shipping container. Kuehne + Nagel, one of the world\u2019s largest freight companies, is one of CartaSense\u2019s clients.  Replacing Regulations With Code  Blockchain is being implemented first within companies and centralized governments that can move quickly on new technologies.  Dubai, for example, has declared its intent to make itself the \u201cfirst blockchain-powered government in the world by 2020.\u201d That could streamline things in real estate, says Stephen McKeon, an associate professor of finance at the University of Oregon who studies blockchain. By moving the central record of all real-estate transactions onto a blockchain, Dubai could make it faster and easier to transfer property titles.  Because such \u201csmart contracts\u201d on a blockchain are code, they can contain rules about how they can be modified or transferred. In this way, blockchain could become a way to transfer the obligation of enforcement from bureaucrats to computers. For example, to prevent fraud, titles could be transferable only to certain accounts, or might transfer only after another condition, such as the transfer of funds in escrow, is met.  Dubai has vowed to become the \u2018first blockchain-powered government in the world by 2020.\u2019 Photo: Rustam Azmi/Getty Images  It\u2019s too early to say whether blockchain, as both a technology and a movement, has the power to overcome issues that thwarted generations of software engineers. The most justifiable skepticism is that blockchain is incremental rather than revolutionary. In some cases, it isn\u2019t much more than a marketing term imposed on systems that hardly differ from existing databases. (There\u2019s a healthy debate about what blockchain even means, and even companies like CartaSense call their system a \u201cblockchain-like technology.\u201d)  But if it works, it has the potential to be a fundamental enabling technology, the way new standards for transmitting data across networks led to the internet. More concretely, it could someday underlie everything from how we vote to who we connect with online to what we buy.

The data-center business generates about $135 million of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, the people said. They said they expect the unit to garner an Ebitda multiple in the high-single-digit range\u2014roughly $1 billion or more\u2014based on the quality of the facilities.  AT&T previously had weighed a sale of its data-center and managed-hosting businesses with Citigroup Inc., some of the people said. Ultimately, it sold only the hosting business, which IBM Corp. purchased in 2015.  The Dallas wireless carrier is among the last large telecom companies looking to unload its platform of data centers\u2014facilities equipped with networked computers, storage devices and servers. Last year, Verizon Communications Inc. sold its portfolio of data centers to Equinix Inc. for $3.6 billion, while that same year CenturyLink Inc. sold its facilities for $2.3 billion to a consortium led by private-equity firm BC Partners. In 2015, Windstream Holdings Inc. divested its data-center business to TierPoint for $575 million.  AT&T is looking to sell the capital-intensive data centers to better focus on its core wireless and video businesses. The process is still ongoing, however, and may not result in a deal. The facilities will require investment and attention from prospective acquirers, said some of the people familiar with the business.  Shedding the data centers could give AT&T extra cash to pay down the cost of acquiring Time Warner Inc., if that deal materializes. The company offered $85 billion in cash and stock for the owner of HBO, CNN and other media assets before the federal government challenged the deal on antitrust grounds. A trial to decide the proposed merger\u2019s fate is slated to begin March 19.  AT&T is selling its data facilities as strong appetite from both cash-rich strategic buyers and new entrants like infrastructure firms, are driving up prices for such assets. The sector continues to expand rapidly as organizations consume larger amounts of data and outsource more information-technology services.  Private-equity firms, in particular, have played a big role in consolidating the data-center industry, drawn to its expansion trajectory and a contracts-driven business model that promises steady cash flow. Over the past decade, investors have successfully built platforms that today are part of bigger conglomerates.  Recent transactions in the sector include Iron Mountain Inc.\u2019s acquisition of IO Data Centers LLC for $1.34 billion, private equity-backed Peak 10 Inc.\u2019s acquisition of ViaWest Inc. for 2.3 billion Canadian dollars and Digital Realty Trust Inc.\u2019s purchase of DuPont Fabros Technology Inc. for $4.95 billion.  \u2014Drew FitzGerald contributed to this article.

The East African country, an important player on the continent in the U.S. war on terror, has been mired in political uncertainty after two fraught elections and bursts of violence.  In a news conference, President Uhuru Kenyatta and opposition leader Raila Odinga \u2014who has refused to concede the vote\u2014promised dialogue, and said they would soon roll out a specific path to reconciliation.  \u201cWe shall bring a process of bringing of our people together, and find out what really divides our nation,\u201d Mr. Kenyatta said. \u201cWe must bring together all our people where no single person is left behind.\u201d  Mr. Tillerson\u2019s arrival, after stops in Ethiopia and Djibouti, reflects Kenya\u2019s role as a top ally in combating al-Shabaab, the al Qaeda affiliate in Somalia. Nairobi is also home to regional headquarters to some major U.S. corporations like IBM , Google and Coca-Cola .  Mr. Tillerson congratulated the two men in a news conference in Nairobi later Friday, and he played down the U.S. role in the sudden reconciliation.  \u201cThe U.S. obviously has been very supportive of Kenya\u2019s journey moving forward after what\u2019s been a difficult election period,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was very important action on their part to show that they are ready to work on behalf of all Kenyans \u2026 all the credit goes to the two leaders this morning.\u201d  Ahead of the visit, a senior State Department official said the U.S. had extensively engaged with Mr. Odinga to bring about reconciliation.  \u201cWhat we said to him ... is that you have a really tremendous opportunity for historic times to really push forward political and economic reforms,\u201d said acting assistant Secretary of State for Africa Donald Yamamoto.  The U.S. diplomatic mission has been involved in attempting mediation as the political crisis deepened.  In the past few months, anti-U.S. sentiment has been on the rise. Opposition supporters saw U.S. recognition of Mr. Kenyatta as a partisan move, and protesters demonstrated outside the U.S. embassy earlier this year over what they called U.S. interference.  Unrest following the two elections led to dozens of fatalities and has reopened the ethnic rifts that in 2007 left more than 1,000 people dead in postelection violence.  Mr. Odinga, who represents a large swath of the population who feel cut off from the country\u2019s elite, has accused Mr. Kenyatta of being a dictator and declared himself the \u201cpeople\u2019s president.\u201d  On Friday he shook Mr. Kenyatta\u2019s hand and promised to \u201cend these differences.\u201d  \u201cWe need to save our children from ourselves,\u201d Mr. Odinga said.  The surprise moves comes amid an escalation of a standoff that started last year ahead of August presidential elections.  In a first for Africa, the outcome of those elections was annulled by the country\u2019s Supreme Court, which ruled they had been marred by irregularities. Mr. Odinga boycotted new elections in October. Only one in three Kenyans took part, and Mr. Kenyatta was re-elected to another 5-year term with 98% of the vote.  Kenya\u2019s economy, a pole for international investment where Chinese-built mega infrastructure like a $4-billion dollar railway runs alongside an equally ambitious highway being built by U.S. construction giant Bechtel, felt the pain of the prolonged crisis.  Its growth rate, previously among the continent\u2019s highest at above 6%, and multiple times the world average, slowed down to 4.8% in 2017, according to the International Monetary Fund.  The Kenyan shilling inched higher against the dollar soon after the joint statement by the two leaders.

The proportion of executives who thought competitors were set to flood into their industry has halved from 54 percent to 26 percent compared to two years ago, the broad-based poll of business decision-makers showed.  \u201cThere\u2019s been a feeling historically that the elephants can\u2019t dance, the incumbents will find it hard to respond and that everyone will be Uber-ed or Airbnb-ed out of existence,\u201d Mark Foster, senior vice president of IBM Global Business Services, told Reuters in an interview.  \u201cBut what we are seeing is actually there is a limit as to how far that can go.\u201d  While some sectors had been hugely disrupted by new digital entrants and some intermediaries pushed out, many of those changes were now being led by existing industry players, he said.  Disruption is a catch-all term for the use of digital technology to up-end existing business models, for example Uber\u2019s impact on the taxi industry by using smartphones to connect riders with drivers, and pricing according to demand.  But just 27 percent of the executives surveyed said they were experiencing significant disruption, an unexpected finding given the deluge many predicted, IBM said. Only 23 percent said the big drivers of change were from outside their industries.  Digital giants, like Google, Apple and Facebook, continued to concentrate their power in some industries, but according to the executives surveyed they were not leading the disruption, and start-ups were increasingly quiescent, the survey found.  Instead, 72 percent said it was the most innovative incumbents who were leading the disruption, including in industries targeted by start-ups such as financial services.  IBM said the incumbents had become better at spotting and acquiring nascent disruptors. They had also realized the need to find partners, even sharing physical assets and people with them, to acquire new skills.  They are investing in the technologies that facilitate the sharing of data across organizations - such as the Internet of Things, which bridges physical and digital assets, and blockchain.  \u201cDisruption hasn\u2019t gone underground,\u201d IBM said in its report released before the start of the mobile industry\u2019s biggest event, the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.  \u201cInstead, it\u2019s emerging as a capability incumbents are ready to embrace.\u201d  IBM surveyed 12,854 top executives, such as chief executives and finance directors, from 112 countries for its report.  \u201cWho Says Elephants Can\u2019t Dance\u201d was the title of the memoir of 1990s era IBM CEO Lou Gerstner, who is credited with bringing the company back from a near-death experience by shifting it into software and services and exiting most hardware businesses.", "stock": "IBM", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-25", "source": "reuters", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-telecoms-mobileworld-ibm-disruptors/major-firms-learning-to-adapt-in-fight-against-start-ups-ibm-idUSKCN1G90IB"}, {"article": "CIMON \u2014 the Crew Interactive Mobile Companion \u2014 is programmed to interact astronauts on the International Space Station. IBM  When German astronaut and scientist Alexander Gerst rockets to the International Space Station in June, he'll bring along an unusual friend: a flying, talking, intelligent robot.  Called the Crew Interactive Mobile Companion, or CIMON, the orb-shaped device weighs about 11 pounds and displays an expressive digital face. Its \"brain\" is powered in part by IBM Watson \u2014 the artificial intelligence software that defeated Jeopardy! champions Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter in 2011 and won $1 million. Aircraft manufacturer Airbus helped develop the robot as well.  \"In short, CIMON will be the first [artificial intelligence]-based mission and flight assistance system,\" Manfred Jaumann, a payload engineer at Airbus, said in a press release. He added that CIMON will be a \"a free flyer, a kind of flying brain\" that will interact with, aid, and learn from astronauts.  CIMON is a far cry from the HAL 9000 supercomputer from the classic sci-fi book and movie \"2001: A Space Odyssey,\" and it isn't the only flying robot headed to the ISS. But CIMON's capabilities are nonetheless impressive.  Training a floating head to be a friend  A photo illustration of CIMON solving a Rubik's cube aboard the International Space Station.

Gerst will unbox CIMON in June and use the flying robot through October. During that time, it will help Gerst solve basic problems and check off tasks like a digital assistant. But CIMON's prime mission is to complete three goals: experiment with crystal growth in space, solve a Rubik's cube, and \"perform a complex medical experiment using CIMON as an 'intelligent' flying camera,\" according to Airbus.  \"Experiments sometimes consist of more than 100 different steps, CIMON knows them all,\" Matthias Biniok, the lead Watson architect in Germany, said in an IBM blog post.  IBM, Airbus, and DLR are working together to fly an artificially intelligent device called the Crew Interactive Mobile Companion, or CIMON, to the International Space Station. Airbus CIMON will use a neural network to interact with and learn from Gerst, at least at first.  Ultimately, CIMON will spy on space station astronauts to help assess their emotional states and psychological \"group effects,\" Biniok said \u2014 a feature that could help better engineer months- or years-long journeys to the moon or Mars.  \"Social interaction between people and machines, between astronauts and assistance systems equipped with emotional intelligence, could play an important role in the success of long-term missions,\" Airbus said.  \"We predict that assistance systems of this kind also have a bright future right here on earth, such as in hospitals or to support nursing care,\" Biniok said.

I found it fascinating, cover to cover. I was especially struck by a section about the history of the tech industry, drawn from the work of historian Nathan Ensmenger of Indiana University \u2014 specifically, how it first became so male-dominated and the societal factors that perpetuate that trend today.  Ensmenger's research takes us back in time to 1967, with an article in Cosmopolitan titled \"The Computer Girls.\" The author describes how a new field called programming had emerged, dominated by women. A female senior systems analyst could make \"$20,000 \u2014 and up!\" ($150,000 in today's world). IBM systems engineer, Ann Richardson, is featured in a photo \"sporting a dress, pearly earrings, and a short bouffant.\" The truth is the tech industry was dominated by women in its early days.  IBM  Why were so many women in these roles in 1967? The marketplace standard for all business in the selection of programmers was based on a gender-neutral test called the IBM Programmer Aptitude Test that assessed logical reasoning and math skills. The test was widely used in the industry (at the time, 349 companies used the test to screen job candidates). Truly a tool of equal opportunity, it led to 20,000 women programmers in the US alone that same year. At the time, women were 10% to 15% of the graduating classes with computer science degrees.  Later, two psychologists developed a different, less scientific test after studying a sample of programmers (only 15% were women) to understand the personality of satisfied programmers. Finding these programmers were often short on social skills (\"they prefer things to people\"), the psychologists initiated a personality test called the Programmer Scale. And the persona of \"computer nerds\" was born.  This personality profiling test became the new industry standard for hiring practices, even as the number of women taking computing degrees had risen to 37% by the early 1980s. Slowly but surely, that standard profiled many women out of tech jobs \u2014 despite the poor science behind it. As computers gained momentum, these computer programmers began to develop products for the consumer market \u2014 including toys \u2014 not surprisingly, mostly marketed to boys.  Fast forward 10 years. Firms were hiring male graduates who had cut their teeth on tech and coding learned from those very computer games. The stereotype only grew stronger with time, leading to the \"bro culture\" and current conditions in Silicon Valley that often marginalize women. By 2013, women made up less than 18% of university computer science classes, a drop of 20 points in about 30 years.  We can only imagine what other outcome we might have seen in tech had the industry not taken that turn in the late 1960s. What might the \"Computer Girls\" of later generations have created if they continued to flood tech and business with their talents?  Many firms \u2014 tech included \u2014 have made meaningful progress toward welcoming women back into the fold, but we still have a long way to go. By 2020, Girls Who Code estimates there will be 1.4 million computing-related jobs in the US alone, only 3% of which will be filled by women. By 2022, it's estimated there will be 2 million unfilled roles in Cybersecurity, yet women only make up 10% of the current cybersecurity workforce.  Who we hire for tech roles will have an impact on the success of our organizations. We know that diverse teams are more innovative, and in an era where bias can be built into artificial intelligence used by all of us, it becomes imperative to build diverse teams to create and deploy technology. The time to act is now.  It will take a multi-dimensional strategy to reverse the course of the last 50 years and re-populate the tech field with a large contingent of women. One lesson from this past history is bias in how we select employees for tech roles. While hackathons may be fun, they favor people with prior coding experience, further marginalizing women with innate skills for coding but not afforded the same computer game culture as their male peers.  At IBM, we are fortunate to have had deep roots in diversity from the very beginning. We were honored this year to receive the acclaimed Catalyst Award for our work to advance women and diversity in business, an award we have not won for 18 years, but we are proud to have won four times. No other tech company has received this award since the 1990s. But the changes in the industry are now palpable \u2014 we see tech companies across the US \u2014 and the world \u2014 stepping up to fight for gender equity in the industry.  Let's hope this marks the beginning of a trend.  After all, today's women (just like the 1960s \"Computer Girls\") have such valuable ideas and contributions to offer. The stakes are high. Let's not settle for bias \u2014 even unconscious bias \u2014 in the AI that is embedded in our world \u2014 whether it's the games we play, the cars we drive, or the technologies that shape our daily lives.

According to an IBM study, 52% of Gen Z females would like to see tools that allow them to customize products for themselves.  Similarly, e-commerce and niche direct-to-consumer brands have dramatically impacted and sped up how products are designed and introduced. Shoppers can now see runway videos on social media and expect those styles to immediately become available for purchase. And even though some fast fashion retailers can get products onto shelves in just weeks, most apparel takes six to 12 months for development.  IBM's AI capabilities can give retailers an edge to speed up the inspirational design phase, helping designers and fashion houses better personalize offerings and meet customers' expectations of designs.  That's why our school, the Fashion Institute of Technology, teamed up with Tommy Hilfiger and IBM on a recent project using IBM Research AI tools to analyze real-time images and fashion industry trends. These AI tools looked at 15,000 images of Tommy Hilfiger products and some 600,000 publicly available runway images to better decipher the silhouettes, colors, and styles. One tool, which analyzed nearly 100,000 patterns from various fabric websites, produces novel and unique patterns \u2014 all which informed and inspired our designs.  \"The goal was to equip the next generation of retail leaders with new skills and bring informed inspiration to their designs with the help of AI,\" said Avery Baker, the chief brand officer at Tommy Hilfiger in an IBM blog post. \"AI can identify upcoming trends faster than industry insiders to enhance the design process.\"  Here are some key takeaways from our experience.  Learning about AI and fashion design  \"As a fashion designer, I tend to stay in my own head, but with these tools, I was able to look into databases that were curated with an incredible amount of information, which, in turn, inspired in new ways that I could make design decisions faster.\" \u2014 Grace McCarty  \"The tools that I used were the silhouette recognition tool, the color analysis tool, and the print tool, which make the designer's job easier and more efficient but does not take their role. AI technologies and fashion designers will be in a symbiotic relationship.\" \u2014 Amy Taehway Eun  How technology like AI will change our roles as designers  \"The traditional design process will always exist; for example, journal research, collecting fabrics, etc. But I believe that taking an innovative approach, like we did with this project, will help designers understand the new tools available to enhance our designs for the future. Technology is improving and changing by the day, and I think we are very lucky to have the chance to be a part of this movement.\" \u2014 Stefka de Ruiter  \"As a result of this project, I can see that the relationship between AI and designers will be collaborative. Technology will help designers create new and fresh products. In the end, I believe a designer's role will be the same. They will research inspirations, they will design, but they will have better options and a different perspective offered to them by AI technology.\" \u2014 Amy Taehway Eun  \"I believe tools like the color print tool or the color trend tool only aided my design process. What would take hours of research can now be accomplished in a few hours with the click of a button.\" \u2014 Luis Hernandez Bermejo  Our favorite part of the project  \"My favorite part of this project was being able to work with so many different people from so many different fields. I also loved being able to experiment with all of the tools. I am someone who is constantly looking for new media to either enhance my designs or my design process.\" \u2014 Grace McCarty  \"One of favorite parts was playing with cognitive fashion tools.

From pasteurization to refrigeration, every advance in food safety keeps people healthier and safer.  But our modern systems are far from perfect. According to Health.gov, foodborne illnesses affect 48 million Americans, lead to 128,000 hospitalizations, and result in 3,000 deaths each year. There's a lot of room for improvement, and Golden State Foods (GSF) is making it their mission to help close that gap through innovation.  To other enterprises in the food industry, \"innovation\" might just be a buzzword that means exotic menus, cocktails in jam jars, or pickling unusual foods, but GSF has a more technical approach. They use the Internet of Things (IoT) to ensure transparency across their entire supply chain, enabling them to maintain unprecedented awareness of their food quality and safety.  GSF produces and ships food in immense quantities. To give you an idea of how massive their operations are, they produce 400,000 hamburger patties every hour. To get that food to your mouth, they have a fleet of more than 2,000 trucks and various other shipping methods supplying 125,000 restaurants in over 60 countries, including McDonald's, Starbucks, Taco Bell, and countless others. So, if you've been thinking to yourself, \"I've never eaten anything from Golden State Foods,\" you're probably mistaken.  In that massive network of kitchens, trucks, and restaurants, there are countless things to keep watch over. Throughout the food's journey, sufficiently cold temperatures must be maintained in order to prevent the growth of dangerous microorganisms. That cold chain is a fragile system that demands vigilance and consistency. Unfortunately, machines can break down or malfunction. When that happens without anybody's knowledge, it's a safety hazard. But with GSF's envisioned new IoT-enabled supply chain, sensor data could be collected at every moment of the food's journey and analyzed in real time by the IBM Watson IoT Platform, ensuring that issues are automatically reported and addressed before they cause bigger problems down the line.  GSF's knack for innovation doesn't stop at the supply chain. Their Connected Restaurant project uses IBM's Connected Store solutions to revolutionize the way restaurants maintain food safety and freshness. Door hinge sensors, digital signage, and with the future plan to include shelf weight sensors, gesture recognition, and Wi-Fi tags collect valuable data that help managers understand how their restaurants consume energy, manage inventory, and keep clean \u2014 even helping them identify ways to do those things better. Most importantly, temperature sensors in food storage facilities trigger alerts if food reaches an unsafe temperature, prompting workers to make corrections immediately that will ensure food safety.  This is why the Internet of Things is the perfect representation of how technology can dramatically enhance human expertise. For centuries, the most meticulous mechanics and engineers have worked with the most brilliant machines of their time, but history is riddled with examples of catastrophic consequences resulting from seemingly unavoidable knowledge gaps. But with a constant flow of sensor data and a platform that's smart and fast enough to process that information, IoT gives us the capacity to have complete, real-time visibility into every physical thing we interact with in the world.

People close to the president have said his attacks on one of the country\u2019s largest businesses have usually been prompted by articles in The Post that Mr. Trump perceives as negative.  Likewise, the president\u2019s interest in the AT&T merger with Time Warner largely stems from his repeated clashes with CNN, a subsidiary of Time Warner, which he regards as biased against him.  Mr. Trump\u2019s lashing out at the N.F.L. \u2014 he has repeatedly criticized football players for kneeling at games and once said he hoped a player \u201csues the hell out of the @nfl for incompetence & defamation\u201d \u2014 comes in part from his decades-long legal fight with the N.F.L. after he bought a team in the competing United States Football League.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  As a private citizen, Mr. Trump has attacked companies, including calling several times for boycotts. The remarks served to raise his profile and fed the image of a no-holds-barred businessman who was unafraid to rebuke his rivals or his critics. But in those days, such comments had little ability to move stock prices or affect sales.  As a candidate and as the president, Mr. Trump also uses his verbal assaults on companies to bolster his populist message that he is on the side of workers, not big business. (Still, Mr. Trump secured a large tax cut last year for corporate America.)  Mr. Trump\u2019s most ardent supporters say they appreciate his willingness to criticize the corporate establishment.  \u201cHe continues to go directly after the companies and not care about political correctness,\u201d said Terry Bowman, a former Trump campaign organizer who works at a Ford Motor parts factory in Ypsilanti, Mich. \u201cHe says things that a polished politician would never say. He says things that come directly from the American worker.\u201d  President Barack Obama once singled out Staples, the office supply company, for failing to provide more health care for its employees. \u201cShame on them,\u201d he said. Earlier in his presidency, Mr. Obama broadly criticized Wall Street bankers whose firms took federal bailout money only to turn around and award bonuses to their executives.  \u201cThat is the height of irresponsibility,\u201d Mr. Obama said in 2009 without identifying specific companies. \u201cIt is shameful.\u201d  Mr. Clinton\u2019s Justice Department aggressively pushed to break up Microsoft on the grounds that it was abusing its monopoly position in personal computing to dominate the internet.

He criticized \u201ca tiny handful of steel executives whose pursuit of private power and profit exceeds their sense of public responsibility.\u201d  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  President Franklin D. Roosevelt on occasion assailed business executives as \u201cmalefactors of great wealth,\u201d attributing the memorable phrase to his cousin, Theodore Roosevelt. Neither president made a practice of identifying specific companies or executives.  Mr. Trump has had no such reticence.  In his most recent attacks on Amazon, he has accused the company of using the United States Postal Service as \u201cits Delivery Boy\u201d and claimed that the federal agency was being ripped off by the online retailer. On Tuesday, he insisted that he was right.  \u201cA report just came out. They said $1.47, I believe, or about that for every time they deliver a package, the United States government \u2014 meaning the post office \u2014 loses $1.47,\u201d the president said.  He added, ominously: \u201cSo Amazon is going to have to pay much more money to the post office. There\u2019s no doubt about that.\u201d  Mr. Trump\u2019s numbers were inaccurate \u2014 the Postal Service makes money from Amazon \u2014 but business executives say such statements have a chilling effect.  When Merck\u2019s chief executive, Kenneth C. Frazier, quit a presidential business council last year in protest of some of the White House\u2019s policy positions, other members were initially reluctant to come to his defense for fear of a verbal attack by Mr. Trump. The council eventually disbanded but only after much internal negotiation among members to quit in force.  The multiday decline of Amazon\u2019s stock price after Mr. Trump\u2019s repeated jabs at the company has exacerbated such fears, said Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management and president of the Chief Executive Leadership Institute.  \u201cOther business leaders don\u2019t want to catch the contagion,\u201d he said.  But he added that refusing to engage could also be risky. He said that Mr. Bezos\u2019s silence had hurt the company, leaving it exposed to Mr. Trump\u2019s accusations that it received subsidies from the Postal Service and was not paying its fair share of taxes.  \u201cThe right answer for C.E.O.s is not to engage in a mud fight but to come with facts,\u201d Mr. Sonnenfeld said. \u201cU.P.S. and FedEx have their facts, but we haven\u2019t heard from Amazon.\u201d", "stock": "IBM", "label": 1, "date": "2018-04-04", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/03/us/politics/trump-amazon.html"}, {"article": "Mr. Chenault \u2018s choice to jump into the world of start-ups is more than just a business decision; to him, it is an opportunity to have a larger impact on Silicon Valley and its business culture.

Of course, he could be talking about any of a host of companies, like Uber, Google or Facebook, the latter of which is facing a revolt among consumers and possibly regulators over the way fake news proliferates on its site.

As start-ups are staying private longer, venture capital firms are finding that someone has to actually run the companies they invest in, to think beyond the early stages of fast growth \u2014 and a quick sale or initial public offering \u2014 and to help them scale over a decade.  \u201cThe median time to I.P.O. has risen dramatically over the last decade, from 4.9 years in 2006 to 8.3 years in 2016,\u201d according to a report from Pitchbook, a data company that tracks deals. Airbnb has been private for 10 years, Uber for nine.  When Mr. Chenault joined Airbnb\u2019s board last week, a company co-founder, Brian Chesky, whom Mr. Chenault has mentored for years, wrote a note to employees announcing the appointment. \u201cMany companies are designed to be finite,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Chesky wrote. \u201cFinite companies are focused on beating their competitors and appeasing short-term interests. But business is not finite. Unlike sports, there is no time clock, so there can be no winning or losing \u2014 there is merely surviving and innovating to endure.\u201d  Mr. Chenault believes there is real value in trying to influence start-ups early in their life cycle, so that patience and foresight become embedded in the DNA.  One problem Mr. Chenault wants to address \u2014 conspicuous to anyone paying attention, but bafflingly inconspicuous to those in the Valley \u2014 is the lack of diversity, both in gender and race, in the tech industry.  \u201cDiversity in the technology digital industry is a big issue,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t make accelerated progress in that area, it will have dire consequences for our society.\u201d  It is even worse in the venture capital industry, where there are few women and even fewer African-Americans.  The numbers are embarrassing and depressing: African-Americans make up only 3 percent of the venture capital work force, according to a study conducted in 2016 by the National Venture Capital Association and Deloitte University Leadership Center for Inclusion. Latinos represented only 4 percent of the venture capital industry.

The fund, which has some $3.75 billion, was founded in Cambridge, Mass., in 1999 and has offices in New York; Palo Alto, Calif.; and San Francisco. Mr. Chenault said he would be based in New York.  In addition to Facebook and Airbnb, he is also on the boards of IBM and Procter & Gamble, which gives him insight into what\u2019s going on in the economy. He acknowledged that there might be times he has to recuse himself from dealing with board issues that conflict with one of the investments General Catalyst makes.  But at this stage of his career, he believes a move to venture capital is the right \u201cvehicle\u2019\u2019 to try to make a difference. Mr. Chenault hopes to help companies not just make long-term plans, but to think about their role in society.  \u201cVenture capital firms have to be more catalytic agents of change not just in the business development,\u201d he said, \u201cbut in helping change the culture in the technology digital sector so there is a greater focus on the responsibilities they have.\u201d", "stock": "IBM", "label": -1, "date": "2018-01-30", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/29/business/dealbook/kenneth-chenault-silicon-valley.html"}, {"article": "The concept for the databases used by most of the world\u2019s big corporations came out of IBM. But another company, Oracle, turned that software into a big business. Researchers at the Silicon Valley lab of Xerox famously pioneered the technology that went into many of Apple\u2019s computers.  Photo  And executives at Alphabet would certainly remember that Google was hardly the first internet search engine. It was just better than anything that came before it.  Other than an ownership stake in Uber, worth about $245 million, that came with settling the lawsuit, Waymo has not made substantial money from those years of research.  That is worth noting, because so many of the companies competing with Waymo are relying on the brainpower of its former employees. Dave Ferguson, a former Waymo engineer, oversees a start-up called Nuro, which is building a driverless car for shipping and delivering goods. Chris Urmson, a longtime Waymo engineer, is the chief executive of a start-up called Aurora. Brian Salesky, a third Waymo engineer, is now at Argo, an autonomous vehicle start-up backed by $1 billion in funding from Ford Motor.  With that brain drain in mind, the Uber lawsuit can also be seen as a fight against a former Google engineer, Anthony Levandowski, who also took his services elsewhere \u2014 first to Otto, a start-up he created, and then to Uber just six months later.  The question was whether he took trade secrets with him. Waymo accused Uber of conspiring with Mr. Levandowski to steal its trade secrets and feed them into a driverless car project already underway inside the ride-hailing company. With Friday\u2019s settlement, Uber has promised that its cars will operate without the help of Waymo\u2019s intellectual property.  There are other issues for Waymo. Unlike Ford, General Motors or Toyota, Waymo does not manufacture and sell cars. Unlike Uber and Lyft, it does not operate a vast ride-hailing services where it could readily deploy vehicles equipped with its own self-driving technology.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  As the big automakers and the ride-hailing companies accelerate their self-driving projects, Waymo may need to find a way of inserting itself into these efforts or to build and operate a new self-driving service of its own.

And you have to offer a service that people really want to use,\u201d Mr. Ferguson said. \u201cYou have to get all of that right.\u201d  The competition still tips its hat to Waymo, and agrees that after nine years of work on autonomous vehicles, it leads the technology race. But the gap is closing. Recent changes in the way driverless cars are built and the rise of readily available hardware that can help these vehicles understand and respond to what is happening around them, have made it easier to compete.

Google began testing its self-driving prototypes on public roads in 2010, and this is what set off so many other efforts.  In the years since, the technology that drives these vehicles has changed in enormous ways thanks to the rise of \u201cneural networks,\u201d which are complex systems that can learn tasks on their own by analyzing vast amounts of data. By analyzing thousands of images, a neural network can, for example, learn to identify a pedestrian. Using these methods, engineers can build and improve self-driving cars at a far more rapid pace.  \u201cThis is profoundly important,\u201d said Mr. Urmson of Aurora, which is supplying self-driving technology to Volkswagen, Audi and Hyundai. \u201cWe can build on top of that revolution.\u201d  Photo  In 2011, Google was among the first companies to build a research lab dedicated to these rapidly evolving techniques, and a number of researchers from this lab eventually moved on to the Google self-driving car project. Google has also built the vast network of specialized hardware needed to drive this kind of \u201cmachine learning,\u201d even building a new computer chip suited to the task.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  These techniques are spreading across the industry. And anyone can immediately tap into enormous amounts of computing power through cloud services operated by the likes of Amazon, Microsoft and, yes, Google.  Many car manufacturers believe they will eventually catch up because they can deploy so many more cars equipped with sensors that can record real-world activity.  \u201cWhat the car companies have is the potential to harvest more data than anyone else,\u201d Gill Pratt, chief executive of the Toyota Research Institute, the Silicon Valley research and development operation created by the Japanese car company, said in an interview last fall. \u201cIt may be this that matters the most.\u201d  Waymo is unlikely to manufacture its own cars. But it may end up running its own self-driving service. Alphabet recently led a $1 billion investment in Lyft, and it could deploy its driverless cars through this existing ride-hailing option. Waymo is also running a private trial of its cars near Phoenix, and it has long hinted that it will offer some sort of undefined public service in the area.  Operating this kind of service is no small thing, and some question whether Waymo is equipped to do so. \u201cThis is where the Ubers and the Lyfts have an advantage,\u201d Mr. Ferguson said.  He cautioned that the departures from Waymo may have an unintended consequence for the entire industry: Many smart people are needed in the same place to figure things out.  \u201cYou need to have a lot of the best minds together to solve it,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of my fears is that we have spread the field a little thin.

The three main indexes notched their best four-week run since 2016.  Intel\u2019s (INTC.O) shares surged as high as $50.15, their highest level since October 2000, and closed up 10.55 percent at $50.08 after results indicated that the chipmaker\u2019s shift to higher-margin data-centre business was working.  AbbVie\u2019s (ABBV.N) shares jumped 13.77 percent after the drugmaker significantly boosted its 2018 earnings forecast with help from U.S. tax reform and said it hopes to accelerate dividend growth and share buybacks.  \u201cWe continue to see these positive steps in the right direction and definitely earnings are clearly justifying a lot of the recent move that we\u2019ve had,\u201d said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina.  Fourth-quarter earnings growth for the S&P 500 is now estimated at 13.2 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data, up from 12 percent at the start of the year. Of the 133 companies in the index that have reported through Friday, 79.7 percent have topped expectations.  The earnings enabled investors to shrug off a reading on economic growth that came in below expectations.  Gross domestic product increased at a 2.6 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, the Commerce Department said in its advance GDP report, below the 3-percent forecast, as the strongest pace of consumer spending in three years resulted in a surge in imports.  \u201cYou have manufacturing and the consumer doing well at the same time and the globe is doing better, so that\u2019s a path for future GDP gains, which has always provided a fertile backdrop for earnings gains,\u201d said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management in Milwaukee.  Weakness in the dollar, which is supportive for large multinational companies, continued. The greenback was down 0.34 percent against a basket of major currencies.

Intel said in a regulatory filing it was not able to estimate the potential losses that may arise out of the lawsuits.  Security researchers at the start of January publicized two flaws, dubbed Spectre and Meltdown, that affected nearly every modern computing device containing chips from Intel, Advanced Micro Devices Inc and ARM Holdings.  The companies have issued fixes but some patches slowed down computers, leading sector analysts to say producers could potentially face suits from clients and consumers claiming damages because their devices did not work as they should.  The company said the remaining two suits were securities class actions, where the plaintiffs allege that Intel and some of its officers violated securities laws by making statements about products or its internal controls that were later revealed to have been false or misleading.  The company\u2019s filing also listed three individual Intel shareholders who had filed actions against members of Intel\u2019s board and other managers, alleging that they failed their duties to Intel by failing to take action in relation to alleged insider trading.  It did not specify what allegations of wrongdoing the suit dealt with.  Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich sold 889,879 shares in the company on Nov. 29 as per a trading plan adopted on Oct. 30, making roughly $39 million from the sale, well before the details of the flaw were made public.  Bloomberg reported last month that although Intel says Krzanich\u2019s sales were part of a pre-arranged stock plan, securities lawyers believed the larger-than-usual transaction could be examined by the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC).  Krzanich said last month that Google researchers told Intel of the flaws \u201ca while ago\u201d.

REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo  Qualcomm has been a supplier of components to Apple for years but the relationship turned sour last year when Apple accused Qualcomm of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates.  In a detailed note citing extensive channel checks with chip suppliers, brokerage Nomura Instinet said it anticipated that Apple would drop Qualcomm in favour of a handful of other suppliers, as it seeks to reduce materials costs for iPhones.  Nomura said it believed Apple would source all of its thin modems - half of which are currently supplied by Qualcomm - from Intel.  Intel shares were up 1.4 percent at $46.81. The world\u2019s biggest PC chipmaker was a late entrant into the market for mobile chips, but has recently been pushing aggressively into the space.  \u201cThere is speculation that Apple might drop Qualcomm altogether for its next generation phones and I think that\u2019s part of the reason the stock is down today,\u201d said Angelo Zino, an analyst at CFRA Research.  Qualcomm issued a revenue forecast last week that missed estimates. It said the forecast already included the assumption that Apple could drop its chips for future products.  Apple will save more than $100 million in the next iPhone cycle by moving to cheaper Intel modem chips, Nomura analyst Romit Shah said.  Broadcom Ltd, which is trying to acquire Qualcomm, will likely lose some $400 million worth of sales of Apple parts in the second half of the year to Qorvo Inc, Shah added.  The reports came as Broadcom on Monday sweetened its bid to buy Qualcomm to more than $121 billion from an earlier $103 billion.  Qualcomm was hit with a $1.23 billion fine by European Union antitrust regulators last month for paying Apple to use only its chips, blocking out rivals such as Intel.  Intel began supplying modem chips to Apple from the iPhone 7 onwards.  Reuters reported in October that Apple had designed iPhones and iPads that would drop chips supplied by Qualcomm. reut.rs/2nNkkGC  Analysts at KGI Securities said Intel's modem chips were less expensive than Qualcomm chips and also met Apple's standards, according to Apple news website 9to5Mac. bit.ly/2FKdoBB  Sector analysts have said in the past that Intel may not be as well prepared for 5G networking as Qualcomm, and that iPhones with Qualcomm chips have performed better than models running on Intel chips.

Intel logo is seen behind LED lights in this illustration taken January 5, 2018. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illutration  Current and former U.S. government officials have raised concerns that the government was not informed of the flaws before they became public because the flaws potentially held national security implications. Intel said it did not think the flaws needed to be shared with U.S. authorities as hackers had not exploited the vulnerabilities.  Intel did not tell the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team, better known as US-CERT, about Meltdown and Spectre until Jan. 3, after reports on them in online technology site The Register had begun to circulate.  US-CERT, which issues warnings about cyber security problems to the public and private sector, did not respond to a request for comment.  Details of when the chip flaws were disclosed were detailed in letters sent by Intel, Alphabet and Apple Inc on Thursday in response to questions from Representative Greg Walden, an Oregon Republican who chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The letters were seen by Reuters.  Alphabet said that security researchers at its Google Project Zero informed chipmakers Intel, Advanced Micro Devices Inc and SoftBank Group Corp-owned ARM Holdings of the problems in June.  It gave the chipmakers 90 days to fix the issues before public disclosing them, standard practice in the cyber security industry intended to give the targets of bugs time to fix them before hackers can take advantage of the flaws.  Alphabet said it left the decision of whether to inform government officials of the security flaws up to the chipmakers, which is its standard practice.  Intel said it did not inform government officials because there was \u201cno indication that any of these vulnerabilities had been exploited by malicious actors,\u201d according to its letter.  Intel also said it did not perform an analysis of whether the flaws might harm critical infrastructure because it did not think it could affect industrial control systems. But Intel said that it did inform other technology companies that use its chips of the issue, according to its letter.  Intel, Alphabet and Apple could not immediately be reached for comment.  AMD, ARM, Microsoft Corp and Amazon.com Inc also responded to questions from lawmakers.  Microsoft said that it did inform several antivirus software makers about the flaws \u201cseveral weeks\u201d ahead of their public disclosure to give them time to avoid compatibility issues.

Apple Inc. is planning to use its own chips in Mac computers beginning as early as 2020, replacing processors from Intel Corp., according to people familiar with the plans.  The initiative, code named Kalamata, is still in the early developmental stages, but comes as part of a larger strategy to make all of Apple\u2019s devices -- including Macs, iPhones, and iPads -- work more similarly and seamlessly together, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. The project, which executives have approved, will likely result in a multi-step transition.  The shift would be a blow to Intel, whose partnership helped revive Apple\u2019s Mac success and linked the chipmaker to one of the leading brands in electronics. Apple provides Intel with about 5 percent of its annual revenue, according to Bloomberg supply chain analysis.  Intel shares dropped as much as 9.2 percent, the biggest intraday drop in more than two years, on the news. They were down 6.4 percent at $48.75 at 3:30 p.m. in New York.  Apple could still theoretically abandon or delay the switch. The company declined to comment. Intel said, \u201cWe don\u2019t comment on speculation about our customers.\u201d  For Apple, the change would be a defining moment. Intel chips remain some of the only major processor components designed by others inside Apple\u2019s product portfolio. Currently, all iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches, and Apple TVs use main processors designed by Apple and based on technology from Arm Holdings Plc. Moving to its own chips inside Macs would let Apple release new models on its own timelines, instead of relying on Intel\u2019s processor roadmap.  \u201cWe think that Apple is looking at ways to further integrate their hardware and software platforms, and they\u2019ve clearly made some moves in this space, trying to integrate iOS and macOS,\u201d said Shannon Cross, an analyst at Cross Research. \u201cIt makes sense that they\u2019re going in this direction. If you look at incremental R&D spend, it\u2019s gone into ways to try to vertically integrate their components so they can add more functionality for competitive differentiation.\u201d  Stand Out  The shift would also allow Cupertino, California-based Apple to more quickly bring new features to all of its products and stand out from the competition. Using its own main chips would make Apple the only major PC maker to use its own processors. Dell Technologies Inc., HP Inc., Lenovo Group Ltd., and Asustek Computer Inc. use Intel chips.  By using its own chips, Apple would be able to more tightly integrate new hardware and software, potentially resulting in systems with better battery life -- similar to iPads, which use Apple chips.  While the transition to Apple chips in hardware is planned to begin as early as 2020, the changes to the software side will begin even before that. Apple\u2019s iPhones and iPads with custom chips use the iOS operating system, while Mac computers with Intel chips run on a different system called macOS. Apple has slowly been integrating user-facing features over the past several years, and more recently starting sharing lower-level features like a new file management system.  \u2018Marzipan\u2019 Platform  As part of the larger initiative to make Macs work more like iPhones, Apple is working on a new software platform, internally dubbed Marzipan, for release as early as this year that would allow users to run iPhone and iPad apps on Macs, Bloomberg News reported last year.  The company has also previously released Macs with ARM-based co-processors, which run an iOS-like operating system, for specific functions like security. The latest MacBook Pro and iMac Pro include the co-processors. Apple plans to add that chip to a new version of its Mac Pro, to be released by next year, and new Mac laptops this year, according to a person familiar with the matter.  Intel has dominated computing processors for more than a decade, taking market share from Advanced Micro Devices Inc., its only rival in the market. Intel also designs and builds modem chips for some iPhone models so that they can connect to cellular networks and make calls. While Apple is down the list of computer sellers by unit shipments, it\u2019s third when measured by revenue last year, highlighting the premium status of its products.  Apple\u2019s decision to switch away from Intel in PC\u2019s wouldn\u2019t have a major impact on the chipmaker\u2019s earnings because sales to the iPhone maker only constitute a small amount of its total, said Kevin Cassidy, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. A bigger concern would be if this represents part of a wider trend of big customers moving to designing their own components, he said.  In 2005, Apple announced a move to Intel chips in its Macs, an initiative that put former Intel Chief Executive Officer Paul Ottelini on stage with Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. It was a partnership that shook up the PC industry and saw Apple shift away from chips co-developed by IBM and Motorola.  Apple\u2019s current chip designs made their name in thin and light mobile devices. That would indicate Apple will start the transition with laptops before moving the designs into more demanding desktop models. Apple has to walk the fine line of moving away from Intel chips without sacrificing the speed and capabilities of its Macs.  A decision to go with ARM technology in computers might lend it credibility where it has failed to gain a foothold so far. Qualcomm Inc., the biggest mobile phone chip provider, is working with PC makers to introduce new thin and light laptops based on its chips in another attempt to steal share from Intel. Microsoft Corp. is supporting that effort by providing a version of its Windows operating system for ARM technology-based chips.  Intel\u2019s dominance of the market has been based on its ability to use leading manufacturing technology to produce processors that are more powerful than those of its competitors. Its would-be rivals haven\u2019t yet produced designs that have displaced Intel\u2019s products when it comes to crunching data quickly.  Apple\u2019s custom processors have been recently manufactured principally by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Ltd. Its decision may signal confidence that TSMC and other suppliers such as Samsung Electronics Co. have closed the gap on Intel\u2019s manufacturing lead and can produce processors that are just as powerful.", "stock": "INTC", "label": -1, "date": "2018-04-02", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-02/apple-is-said-to-plan-move-from-intel-to-own-mac-chips-from-2020"}, {"article": "Intel Corp., whose microprocessors dominate the personal-computer market, gave an upbeat quarterly and annual sales forecast, signaling optimism that demand will persist even as the industry scrambles to fix vulnerabilities in its PC and server chips.  Sales in the current period will be about $15 billion, plus or minus $500 million, and annual revenue will rise to a record $65 billion, the company said in a statement late Thursday. The projections exceed analysts\u2019 estimates.  Intel shares gained 6 percent in pre-market trading at 6:04 a.m. in New York Friday, after closing at $45.30. The stock rose 27 percent in 2017, lagging behind the 38 percent advance in the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index. The benchmark has outpaced Intel so far this year, too.  Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich is trying to remake Intel into a more general provider of chips, expanding into new markets such as self-driving cars and industrial systems. While those efforts helped, it was a 20 percent sales jump in its data-center chip business that really powered the quarter -- and will determine success for the foreseeable future.  Intel repeated its assertion that chip flaws known as Meltdown and Spectre won\u2019t have a material impact on its finances. Forecasts didn\u2019t budge after the potential exploits were made public in early January. Krzanich said Intel has made progress on patching exposed computer systems, but said he\u2019s \"acutely aware that we have more to do.\u201d  The chipmaker\u2019s outlook indicates that corporations are spending on infrastructure, a good sign for earnings reports by companies such as Microsoft Corp., Kim Forrest, an analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group, which owns Intel shares.  \"They look really good,\u201d she said. \u201cEven the data center came back.\u201d  In the fourth quarter, sales climbed 4.3 percent to $17.1 billion, Intel said. The company posted a net loss of 15 cents a share because of an income tax expense of $5.4 billion, a result of the new U.S. tax law passed last month. Excluding certain items, profit was $1.08 a share. On that basis, analysts had projected 87 cents in profit, on revenue of $16.4 billion.  Intel Chief Financial Officer Bob Swan said the boost in Intel\u2019s sales and profit in the recent quarter came from a return to spending by corporations on their internal networks. That trend may not continue, he said. Sales to cloud-service providers -- companies such as Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and Amazon.com Inc. -- rose 35 percent in the fourth quarter.  \u201cWe see good demand trends\u201d in the first quarter, Swan said in an interview. \u201cThe biggest pleasant surprise was enterprise.\u201d  After it announced the vulnerabilities Jan. 3, Intel said its chips were not faulty -- they work as promised -- noting that the potential exploits affect all modern processors, not just Intel products. It then accepted more responsibility, apologized and began submitting regular updates on efforts to roll out software patches that close security holes. While there have been no reports of data being stolen via these methods, some of the patches have caused computers to repeatedly reboot or slow down, particularly older machines.  Intel\u2019s PC chip unit had fourth-quarter sales of $9 billion, down 2 percent from a year earlier. Santa Clara, California-based Intel is facing a revived challenge in the PC market from longtime rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc.  The data-center unit, which sells powerful, expensive chips for machines that run the internet and corporate networks, had revenue of $5.6 billion, up 20 percent. Intel\u2019s CEO has promised long-term growth in that unit of more than 10 percent, though gains in recent quarters had fallen short of that target. In the third quarter, data-center division sales rose just 7 percent.  Sales of memory chips rose 9 percent, while revenue from chips for a new range of devices that are gaining the ability to compute and connect, known as the internet of things, climbed 21 percent.  Intel\u2019s renewed commitment to memory chips takes it into direct competition with Samsung Electronics Co., the only company in the industry with comparable sales and manufacturing resources.  Intel invented the memory market when the company was founded in the late 1960s. It got out of the business in the early 1990s when competition from Asian companies became too great. This is typically the most volatile part of the chip industry. In some years, producers lose money when supply gluts cause prices to drop. Intel\u2019s latest memory chip foray made money in the fourth quarter, and the company expects it to remain profitable throughout 2018.  While overall performance has been strong by Intel, there are challenges ahead. For one, the company may not have generated enough sales to maintain its 25-year run as the world\u2019s largest chipmaker.

Samsung Electronics Co. just knocked Intel off its perch as the world\u2019s biggest chipmaker by revenue, a spot the U.S. company has held since 1992. On Tuesday, Samsung reported 2017 chip sales of $69 billion, blowing past Intel\u2019s $63 billion from last year.  The switch underlines how Samsung has transformed itself from a maker of cheap televisions into a pervasive supplier of key components in smartphones and other modern computing devices. It\u2019s also a testament to the growth of memory chips, Samsung\u2019s main market.  Intel, whose processors are the heart of about 90 percent of the world\u2019s computers, didn\u2019t have a bad year. Sales grew 6 percent. Success in computers is no longer enough, though.

The U.S. company exited the market when competition from Japanese companies became too great in the early 1990s, then recently re-entered. One of Intel\u2019s biggest growth areas last year was memory chips, but it has a long way to go to catch up with Samsung.

Thompson\u2019s favorite drugs, CES, held in Las Vegas each January, has always been a little surreal. This year\u2019s bacchanal was crammed with drones, self-driving cars, and internet-connected toilet seats\u2014and the opening keynote speech was stranger than any of that. On Jan. 8, 5,000 ticket holders made their way through a sea of hired models and ultra-high-definition TVs to the Monte Carlo Resort and Casino on the Strip, where they squeezed into a theater to watch a two-hour psychedelic variety show. The opening act, a Blue Man Group-style quartet called Algorithm \u2019n Blues, pantomimed a performance of Human by the Killers, backed up by a digital bassist on a giant LCD screen, flying drones that played keys on a giant piano, and a trio of acrobats, dressed like extras from Tron, who performed a trampoline routine. And that\u2019s not the weird part.  After the music came Brian Krzanich, chief executive of Intel Corp., doing about the best Willy Wonka impression one can do in a button-down blue dress shirt and jeans. \u201cI\u2019d love nothing more than to simply put my phone away and take this evening to truly celebrate innovation with you,\u201d the 57-year-old CES regular said, bragging about his company\u2019s advances in virtual reality and new partnerships with autonomous-vehicle technology companies. Former NFL quarterback Tony Romo appeared onstage to talk up Intel\u2019s work in 3D video, and Krzanich showed off a full-size pilotless helicopter before capping the evening by suggesting they head outside to see a light show over the famous Bellagio fountains involving hundreds of drones\u2014all, of course, either made by Intel or running on Intel chips.  CEO Krzanich holds Intel\u2019s latest drone, the Shooting Star Mini, as he speaks at CES in Las Vegas on Jan. 8. Photographer: Rick Wilking/Reuters  The whole thing was a dizzying reminder that although Intel isn\u2019t the household name it was during the PC boom of the 1990s, it can still put on a show. The company makes about 90 percent of the world\u2019s computer processors and 99 percent of the server chips in the data centers that effectively run the internet. While the world\u2019s largest chipmaker has struggled to expand beyond those core businesses, it reported $60 billion in 2017 revenue at a gross margin of 63 percent, an unimaginable profit for most factory owners.  What made the Intel keynote so surreal was that Krzanich barely mentioned the potentially catastrophic news that was on everyone\u2019s mind. The previous week, the Register, a British technology journal, reported that independent researchers had discovered flaws in Intel\u2019s chip designs that hackers could exploit to steal data thought to be the most secure. These vulnerabilities, known as Meltdown and Spectre, are a very, very big deal, allowing hackers to peek at the part of the computer where companies and individuals store passwords, encryption keys, and most anything sensitive. The flaws are unprecedented. Every PC, every smartphone, and every server in the world is exposed. The episode has already led to lawsuits and calls for investigations, and undermines more than a decade of Intel\u2019s technical wizardry.  For the past few years, major cloud providers have sought ways to reduce their dependence on Intel\u2019s server chip monopoly, quietly developing their own models or funding nascent competitors. And just days before Krzanich took the stage in Vegas, Intel gave those companies\u2014and everybody else\u2014a massive incentive to accelerate those efforts.  Even the researchers who discovered Meltdown and Spectre initially didn\u2019t believe what they were seeing. \u201cThat would have been such a major f--- -up by Intel that it can\u2019t be possible,\u201d researcher Michael Schwarz recalls thinking. Spectre affects all modern chips, including those made by competitors, but the easier hack, Meltdown, applies almost exclusively to chips made by Intel.  The flaws can be patched, but those patches could slow the Intel chips by as much as 30 percent, the equivalent of turning a state-of-the-art server chip into one from 2013. \u201cThere is no playbook for something like this,\u201d says Charles Carmakal, a vice president at Mandiant, the arm of security company FireEye that consults on high-profile hacks. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen a vulnerability that worked across so many different operating systems and devices.\u201d  If the slowdown turns out to be anywhere near as bad as some think it could be, it\u2019ll amount to a major price increase for data center owners, who could in turn demand that Intel cover the cost. (So far, the big cloud providers have said their customers won\u2019t be affected. Their plans, and the costs, remain unclear.) And because Intel is so reliant on chip revenue, there\u2019d be no easy way to make up those losses. Intel\u2019s stock is down 5 percent since the Register report; shares of Advanced Micro Devices Inc., its only real competitor for PC and server chips, are up 11 percent.  During the six months Intel was quietly working to try to fix the vulnerabilities, Krzanich sold $24 million in company shares. Intel says the stock sale was part of a plan that had been in place before anyone there knew about Meltdown or Spectre, but the day after Krzanich\u2019s CES speech, two U.S. senators sent letters to the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice demanding investigations. Consumer and shareholder lawyers have filed a dozen class actions against Intel, and there are few signs the pressure will let up on Krzanich anytime soon. In a research note, an analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. called the stock sale \u201cindefensible.\u201d  \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen a vulnerability that worked across so many different operating systems and devices\u201d  Intel, which declined to make Krzanich available for comment, has treated Meltdown and Spectre as something close to a nonstory. In its initial statement, issued on Jan. 3, the company disputed that Spectre and Meltdown represented \u201cflaws,\u201d describing them as merely a new field of \u201cresearch\u201d into an industrywide phenomenon. It said any slowdowns would be minimal, close to zero for most people, and that the episode would have no impact on Intel\u2019s business. At CES, after Algorithm \u2019n Blues but before Romo, Krzanich briefly addressed the not-flaw by thanking Intel\u2019s peers for \u201ccoming together\u201d to \u201caddress the recent security findings.\u201d  Intel\u2019s clients, including the biggest companies in the technology industry, have mostly kept quiet. They have no alternative supplier. Privately, some are seething. The day after Krzanich\u2019s big show, Microsoft Corp. published a blog post disputing Intel\u2019s earlier assertion that users wouldn\u2019t notice the slowdowns. Navin Shenoy, an Intel executive vice president, said in a statement that customer security is \u201ca critical priority\u201d for the company. In private conversations with clients, Intel\u2019s top managers haven\u2019t always acted that way, treating a disaster that threatens the security of every computer user and the profits of a whole category of businesses as no big deal, according to an executive at one of Intel\u2019s large customers. The potential fallout isn\u2019t an academic concern, the executive says, \u201cit\u2019s f---ing scary.\u201d  Part of what makes Meltdown and Spectre so terrifying is that they upend more than a decade of conventional wisdom about information security. Starting in the mid-2000s, Intel added a layer of security within its chips and began encouraging developers to store users\u2019 most sensitive information in the walled-off area rather than in regular software memory. Only about two years ago did researchers first notice, and begin trying to crack, a feature called speculative execution that Intel uses to speed up its chips. It essentially allows a chip to access any data it guesses a user is about to ask for, even if it\u2019s inside the secure area, before checking whether the user is allowed to access it. This is a big reason computers and smartphones have kept getting faster year after year. It also left a gaping security hole.  The feature\u2019s vulnerabilities were discussed at conferences and in academic papers but were considered merely theoretical until last spring, when Jann Horn, a 22-year-old researcher in Google\u2019s elite cybersecurity division, succeeded in reading private data from the secure area. Horn informed Intel in June, beating out three other research teams that discovered the flaw later in 2017. Together, they began working with Intel to patch the flaws; until the Register report, they\u2019d planned to disclose their findings on Jan. 9. As Google pointed out in a blog post about the discovery, the security flaws could allow a cloud user to covertly snoop on another customer\u2019s machine. Anyone with an Amazon Web Services account could, in theory, steal another AWS user\u2019s login data and access their files, though that would often require physical access to the target machine.  In interviews, Intel executives dispute suggestions that the company\u2019s focus on chip speeds led it to overlook obvious vulnerabilities. Intel says it\u2019s already provided software fixes for 90 percent of its chips and that this is nothing out of the ordinary. \u201cWe have an ongoing process to make our products better,\u201d says Stephen Smith, general manager of the company\u2019s data center group. \u201cWe just happen to be doing it under a spotlight now.\u201d At CES, Krzanich told the crowd that \u201cas of now\u201d Intel had \u201cnot received any information that these exploits have been used to obtain customer data.\u201d  This sounds more comforting than it probably should. Security analysts say that if four groups of researchers independently figured out the exploits, then some number of governments with sophisticated cyberweapons programs (China, Russia, the U.S.) likely did, too. An intelligence agency armed with Spectre or Meltdown would likely aim big, according to Mandiant\u2019s Carmakal. \u201cA government wouldn\u2019t use this to break into Target,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019d use it to get into the Department of Defense.\u201d  So far, Meltdown and Spectre probably pose less risk to the average person than, say, a simple phishing attack in which a hacker tries to send you to a malicious website. They won\u2019t lead to the kind of widespread panic that resulted from the 2017 hack of Equifax\u2019s customer database.  But that could change. Hackers who hadn\u2019t tried to break into Intel\u2019s hardware, believing there was no way it would leave a side door open, are now seeking ways in. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be looking for other things like this,\u201d says Jeff Pollard, an analyst with the research firm Forrester. \u201cThis is a new kind of attack. This is going to linger.\u201d  And long-term fixes won\u2019t be easy. While coders can pull a few all-nighters to close holes in software, a chip takes years to design, test, and mass-produce. Each model can cost tens of millions of dollars to develop. For now, computer owners and data center operators will have to make an unsavory choice: Use Intel\u2019s software patches and accept slower speeds, or skip the patches and remain at risk. (Intel has already said patches are causing some machines to reboot more often than usual.) Future designs will include hard-wired fixes that speed things up, but the first versions of those won\u2019t appear until later this year, the company says.  All of this puts Intel in a tough spot. The company is a nonfactor in the smartphone-chips business dominated by Samsung, Qualcomm, and ARM, and rival Nvidia has taken a commanding lead in the fast-growing market for graphics chips used in artificial intelligence applications. Now, Meltdown and Spectre threaten the core of Intel\u2019s business. The company has no competitor in server chips at the moment, but this episode could change that. Microsoft and Google have publicly praised Qualcomm Inc.\u2019s first server chip, which went on sale in November, and Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook all have internal divisions working on chip designs.  Intel\u2019s more immediate threat is political. It\u2019ll almost certainly have to withstand criticism from lawmakers at a time when governments around the world are increasingly skeptical of tech companies with de facto monopolies. \u201cThis hyper-dependence on one chipmaker, indeed one technology, although billed as a way to lower prices, has had the effect also of greatly increasing society\u2019s exposure not only to hackers but also to \u2018shock events\u2019 that disrupt entire systems,\u201d the Open Markets Institute, a Washington think tank that advocates for controls on market concentration, wrote in its weekly newsletter on Jan. 11. For now, Intel\u2019s big problem is Krzanich\u2019s stock sales, but if it becomes clear that customers have been harmed by hacking or higher costs, regulators will likely seek recourse through consumer protection suits, antitrust investigations, or both.  Intel has faced this kind of public pressure before. In 1994 the company was heavily criticized for trying to ignore evidence that its Pentium chips were generating errors for certain obscure calculations. The crisis caused IBM to announce that it would no longer ship machines that used the flawed chips. Intel\u2019s meticulously constructed brand, Intel Inside, which had served as a sort of Good Housekeeping Seal for computer buyers, suddenly looked questionable. As part of Intel\u2019s extensive mea culpa, then-CEO Andy Grove offered to replace all the buggy chips and took an inventory writedown of $475 million, about half its annual R&D budget at the time.  Grove\u2019s lesson, as he recounted in his business-advice book Only the Paranoid Survive, was that Intel had been caught out. Even a quarter-century into its existence, the massive company still saw itself as a scrappy tech startup. With its size and influence, he acknowledged, came new responsibilities. \u201cThe trouble was,\u201d Grove wrote, \u201cnot only didn\u2019t we realize that the rules had changed, but what was worse, we didn\u2019t know what rules we now had to abide by.\u201d  Intel has been the top chipmaker for the past 25 years, but Meltdown and Spectre could turn out to be much worse than the Pentium bug. If the company wants to maintain its position, it\u2019ll need real humility, not cheap theatrics.  \u2014With Dina Bass, Mark Bergen, Alex Webb, and Dune Lawrence", "stock": "INTC", "label": 1, "date": "2018-01-20", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-01-18/intel-has-a-big-problem-it-needs-to-act-like-it"}, {"article": "Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Intel Corp.\u2019s main rival in computer microprocessors, said a report earlier this month alleging that its chips have widespread, fundamental vulnerabilities greatly exaggerated the severity of the threat.  There are 13 potential exploits that will be fixed within weeks through software updates, the chipmaker said Tuesday in a statement. There\u2019s no evidence that of any of those holes has been used for malevolent purposes, and it would be extremely difficult to use any of them to attack computers, the Sunnyvale, California-based company said. AMD saw reports of unusual trading activity in its stock about a week ago when an Israeli company called CTS Labs went public with a report on the flaws and has reported it to the relevant authorities.  The chip industry was stung at the beginning of the year when Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google revealed that a flaw in all modern microprocessors may allow hackers to steal data such as passwords or encryption keys previously thought to be secure. AMD argued at the time that its chips were less at risk than those from Intel, which dominates the market for computer microprocessors.  \u201cIt\u2019s important to note that all the issues raised in the research require administrative access to the system, a type of access that effectively grants the user unrestricted access to the system,\u201d AMD Chief Technology Officer Mark Papermaster said in the statement, referring to the recent report. \u201cAny attacker gaining unauthorized administrative access would have a wide range of attacks at their disposal well beyond the exploits identified in this research.\u201d  The issue isn\u2019t related to the vulnerabilities Google identified in January and isn\u2019t caused by AMD\u2019s Zen architecture, a new design that underpins all of its new chips, AMD said in its statement. The chipmaker said that, unlike the more widespread Spectre and Meltdown issues identified in January, software fixes for the currently discovered vulnerabilities won\u2019t slow down computers.  On March 12, CTS Labs contacted AMD about the potential exploits. Then the firm went public 24 hours later with its report, according to AMD.  \u201cThe vulnerabilities we have discovered allow bad actors who infiltrated the network to persist in it, surviving computer reboots and re-installations of the operating system, while remaining virtually undetectable by most endpoint security solutions,\u201d CTS said in the report. \u201cThis allows attackers to engage in persistent virtually undetectable espionage, buried deep in the system and executed from AMD\u2019s Secure Processor and chipset.\u201d  CTS estimated that it would take \u201cmany months\u201d to address the issue. The researcher didn\u2019t give AMD that amount of time to fix the holes before drawing public attention to them, something that goes against standard practice in these situations.  \u201cI fault CTS Labs for not following industry-standard coordinated disclosure procedure,\u201d said Ben Gras, a researcher at Vrije University in Amsterdam who focuses on hardware security flaws. \u201cA widely accepted practice in these situations is to coordinate with the vendor and affected parties during a window of confidentiality before publicizing security sensitive information, reducing the impact of the research while still maintaining transparency. As it stands, this leads me to believe they are not acting in good faith, and make me interpret other aspects of this report skeptically.\u201d  On Wednesday, CTS said it disagreed with AMD\u2019s assessment of the risks posed by the weaknesses and the time frame for patching them. \"Our view is that AMD is attempting to downplay the significance of its vulnerabilities,\" CTS said in a statement.  \u2014 With assistance by Jeremy Kahn, and Gwen Ackerman", "stock": "INTC", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-20", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-20/amd-confirms-chip-vulnerability-says-report-exaggerated-danger"}, {"article": "Music-streaming service Spotify Technology SA has avoided the traditional path to a stock listing, eschewing costly investment bankers and saying it wants to price its shares at a level that will ensure stability rather than a big jump on the first day of trading.

How Apple Built a Chip Powerhouse to Threaten Qualcomm and Intel  The company already makes many of the chips for its iPhones, iPads, Macs and Watches. By Mark Gurman January 29, 2018 By Mark Gurman  For several years, Apple has been steadily designing more and more of the chips powering its iPhones, iPads, Macs and Apple Watches. This creates a better user experience and helps trump rivals. Recently the company got a fresh incentive to go all-in on silicon: revelations that microprocessors with components designed by Intel Corp., Arm Holdings Plc and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. are vulnerable to hacking. Steve Jobs long believed Apple should own the technologies inside its products rather than rely on mashups of components from other chip makers, including Samsung, Intel and Imagination Technologies. In 2008, the company made a small but significant step in that direction by acquiring boutique chip maker P.A. Semi. Two years later, Jobs unveiled the iPad. The world focused on the tablet\u2019s giant touchscreen, book-reading prowess and creativity apps. But the most ground-breaking technology was hidden away inside: the A4, Apple\u2019s first processor designed in-house. That original \u201csystem-on-a-chip\u201d has since been succeeded by increasingly powerful processors. Today, Apple packs its devices with custom components that process artificial intelligence tasks, track your steps, power game graphics, secure Face ID or Touch ID data, run the Apple Watch, pair AirPods to your phone and help make Macs work the way they do. The result: a chip powerhouse that could one day threaten the dominance of Qualcomm Inc. and even, eventually, Intel.

Apple declined to comment. Apple isn\u2019t the first company to create its own chips in-house. It\u2019s just the most successful. HP Inc., Motorola, International Business Machines Corp. and Koninklijke Philips NV all had chip divisions at one time or another. Those ultimately failed or stumbled because chip-making is the sport of kings: It\u2019s brutally expensive and requires massive scale. Apple has wisely focused on designing its silicon (for its system on a chips, Apple uses reference designs from Arm Holdings Plc). Manufacturing is left to others, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Apple\u2019s push into the complicated and pricey chips business makes sense so long as the company is selling 300 million devices a year. And it's not as though the entrenched players are going anywhere. Qualcomm is investing in next-generation 5G networks, several companies are making AI chips and Intel is pushing mobile processors. Meanwhile, Samsung, Apple's arch rival, is a major chip manufacturer in its own right. Apple has chip-building and testing facilities in unmarked buildings in and around hometown Cupertino, California, and in Herzliya, Israel, a hotbed of new technologies. The operation employs hundreds of people and is run by Johny Srouji, who joined Apple in 2008 after stints at Intel and IBM and has likened his chip architects to \u201cartists.\u201d In recent months, Srouji has been poaching more and more modem engineers from Qualcomm. The chipmaker builds iPhone modems but is engaged in a legal battle with Apple over licensing fees Qualcomm charges smartphone makers. Hiring Qualcomm people could mean Apple plans to eventually create its own modems, which connect phones to cellular networks. For now, Apple is considering using Intel and MediaTek Inc. exclusively for modems in this year\u2019s iPhone lineup, Bloomberg News reported last year.

The engineer\u2019s private airfield is nestled in a valley on the Northern California coast between Monterey and Santa Barbara, and it\u2019s remote by design, out past a swirl of tan and green fields. Bevirt, a 44-year-old whose bursts of childlike delight punctuate his otherwise quiet intensity, bounds out to greet the chopper, then points the arriving pair of reporters to the prototype resting on the dirt runway nearby. It\u2019s an exotic-looking white aircraft with numerous propellers. (Bevirt agreed to the visit only on the condition that physical specifics remain unpublished.) He calls it an air taxi. \u201cThis is what I have been dreaming about for 40 years,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the culmination of my life\u2019s work.\u201d  Bevirt is the founder and chief executive officer of Joby Aviation Inc., a startup that\u2019s spent the past nine years trying to design and build a whole new kind of short-hop aircraft. Believe it or not, things have been going well. We were the first two reporters to see a demo of the prototype, named Rachel after the women several of its creators used to date. The pilot managed a vertical takeoff, 15 minutes of flight in a 15-mile loop, and a safe landing. Powered by electric motors and sophisticated control software, the taxi performs like a cross between a drone and a small plane, able to zip straight up on takeoff and then fly at twice the speed of a helicopter while making about as much noise as a swarm of superbees. Bevirt says thousands of these sky cabs will one day shuttle people around cities, soaring above the conventional traffic below.  Broken promises of flying cars predate The Jetsons, but Bevirt has made believers out of people with deep pockets. On Feb. 1, Joby Aviation announced a fresh $100 million in venture funding, more than three times the capital it had raised before, from investors including Intel Capital, Toyota AI Ventures, JetBlue Technology Ventures, and Capricorn Investment Group, a prominent backer of Tesla and Space Exploration Technologies. \u201cThere are a lot of dreamers in this space, but we have done a lot of research here, and JoeBen has absolutely nailed the right time for it,\u201d says Bonny Simi, president of JetBlue\u2019s investment arm.  Thanks to advances in electric motors, batteries, software, and other components, the field of flying cars, air taxis, or whatever you want to call them (Sky Segways?) is a lot more crowded than it was even a couple of years ago. Larry Page, the CEO of Google parent Alphabet Inc., has pumped tens of millions of dollars into startups Kitty Hawk and Zee.Aero. A dozen other startups around the world have similar projects at various stages of design, as do Airbus SE and Boeing Co. Even Uber Technologies Inc. claims to be working on an air taxi service, tentatively called Uber Elevate. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to happen within the next 10 years,\u201d Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said during a Jan. 22 speech at a tech conference in Munich.  Bevirt\u2019s secrecy extends to the environs of Joby\u2019s camouflaged lair: The trailers that serve as his engineers\u2019 flight-control centers are covered in posters warning them about the area\u2019s mountain lions, snakes, spiders, and other deadly fauna. Bevirt does say Joby intends to build an aircraft that will hold four passengers and a pilot and will travel at least 150 miles on a single charge at an altitude of a few thousand feet or less. (That would mean the cabin wouldn\u2019t need to be pressurized.) \u201cAnother goal is to be 100 times more quiet during takeoff and landing than a helicopter and near-silent during flyovers,\u201d says Joby Executive Chairman Paul Sciarra, a co-founder of Pinterest, the image-centric wish list site.  All told, Joby\u2019s venture funding totals about $130 million  A trained mechanical engineer and sci-fi nerd, Bevirt made a fortune selling bendable tripods and other camera accessories more than a decade ago. He\u2019s poured that money into his aviation startup. A couple of years back, he had 35 people working on various prototype craft; now he has 120, most of them working far from the airfield at his 500-acre ranch in Santa Cruz. There, engineers make just about every part of the air taxi prototype, from the body and motors to the flight-control software.  Joby says it plans to mass-produce its air taxis for a ride-hailing service that it will operate. Bevirt\u2019s vision includes a landing pad for every office and cul-de-sac. Each trip, he says, will cost about as much as an Uber or Lyft ride does today, and eventually the air taxis will be fully autonomous. \u201cOur mission is to save a billion people an hour a day,\u201d he says. He\u2019s less confident about a rollout date, partly because the formidable challenges ahead include convincing politicians, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the cab-hailing public that air taxis are safe. \u201cWe are well into the design and build of the production vehicle\u201d was the most he\u2019d say on the subject of time to market.  While a whiff of the surreal hangs over Bevirt\u2019s claims that he\u2019ll \u201cchange people\u2019s relationship with aircraft,\u201d some of his investors are counting on it. JetBlue\u2019s Simi says she sees Joby as part of a broader shift in the aerospace industry, a way to make more personal forms of air travel a part of daily life. JetBlue has also invested in Zunum Aero, which is building an electric jet that can fly dozens of people 1,000 miles. And though Intel owns a stake in a German air taxi startup called Volocopter GmbH, Wendell Brooks, president of Intel Capital, says Joby \u201cis very far ahead relative to all the other things we\u2019ve seen.\u201d  For more on flying cars, check out the Decrypted podcast:  For more on the future of transportation, go to Bloomberg.com/hyperdrive", "stock": "INTC", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-01", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-01/air-taxi-startup-joby-has-a-working-prototype-and-a-fresh-100m"}, {"article": "Value of China\u2019s yearly chip imports dwarfs that of crude oil  China\u2019s aspiration to deploy 30 million autonomous vehicles within a decade is seeding a fledgling chip industry, with startups like Horizon Robotics Inc. emerging to build the brains behind those wheels.  The Beijing-based company is taking aim at Nvidia Corp. and Mobileye NV just as the autonomous-driving business takes off and uncertainty looms over international trade. Annual revenue from the chips used in driverless vehicles globally should more than double to $5 billion by 2021, according to Gartner Inc.  A screen shows a demonstration of the cognition level of Horizon Robotics\u2019 Journey processor. Photographer: Giulia Marchi/Bloomberg  Horizon Robotics is an example of China\u2019s resolve to move up the manufacturing value chain by focusing less on commodity smartphones and TVs, and more on sophisticated semiconductors and artificial intelligence that can help cars drive themselves or spaceships land on the moon. That industrial policy is meant to help China reduce its 1.75 trillion yuan ($276.4 billion) in annual chip imports, a value dwarfing its oil imports.  \u201cChina has to spare no efforts to pick up and develop its own chip technology to improve our own sense of security, especially when the U.S. government is making us fearful about any protectionism against China,\u201d Wei Shaojun, director of the Beijing-based Institute of Microelectronics at Tsinghua University, said at a forum in Shanghai.  A Horizon Robotics processor sits onboard a vehicle. Photographer: Giulia Marchi/Bloomberg  China\u2019s push for self-reliance is a priority for President Xi Jinping\u2019s administration, which set up a 200 billion-yuan fund for investments in homegrown chipmakers, Bloomberg News reported.  Overseers of the world\u2019s largest car market -- and electric-vehicle market -- want to put Chinese-developed chips under those hoods and behind those dashboards. The government expects to have a manufacturing industry for parts such as sensors and embedded chips with a production value exceeding 100 billion yuan by 2020.  More Chips in Your Tesla Market for sophisticated semiconductors set to boom as cars get more features Source: Gartner, Bloomberg Intelligence  \u201cEveryone is on the same starting line, thus creating an opportunity for China,\u201d said Ding Wenwu, president of the state-backed China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund Co.  Horizon Robotics was founded in 2015 by Yu Kai, the former head of Baidu Inc.\u2019s artificial-intelligence business called the Institute of Deep Learning. Its investors include Intel Capital Corp., Shanghai-based Harvest Fund Management Co., Russian billionaire Yuri Milner and state-owned China Jianyin Investment Ltd.  The company completed a $100 million funding round in December.  Horizon\u2019s smaller-than-a-postage stamp circuit board is called \u201cJourney 1.0,\u201d which was showcased inside a General Motors Co. GMC Yukon XL at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January. The processor can detect as many as 200 targets -- including pedestrians, vehicles and lane markings -- in real time and help the driverless car avoid collisions.  \u201cChinese companies have been evolving from the positions of made-in-China to created-in-China,\u201d said Yu, 42. \u201cAnd now we are heading to invented-in-China.\u201d  The company is cooperating with Volkswagen AG\u2019s Audi; Chongqing Changan Automobile Co., the local partner of Ford Motor Co.; and parts supplier Robert Bosch GmbH to get inside future autonomous vehicles. A self-driving Changan car completed a 1,200-mile road trip in China in 2016.  Horizon Robotics\u2019 second generation Journey processor. Photographer: Giulia Marchi/Bloomberg  In an industry where the number of LEDs in a brake light is scrutinized for impact on gas mileage, processing data from laser, radar and camera sensors without draining an electric battery poses an enormous challenge for chipmakers.  \u201cWhat we are seeking is a horse that can run fast and long but eats as little as possible,\u201d Yu said. \u201cIf the embedded vehicle chip consumes too much power, it will lead to a burning car rather than a running car.\u201d  Audi selected Horizon Robotics for a China-specific project and will evaluate the outcome before taking any next steps, Johanna Barth, a Beijing-based spokeswoman for Audi, said without elaborating.  Audi still uses Nvidia and Mobileye sensors in cars sold outside China, she said.  Nvidia, based in Santa Clara, California, has recorded revenue growth of more than 20 percent for the last seven quarters, partly because of increasing demand for autonomous vehicles. It teamed with Baidu to develop an autonomous-vehicle platform, with plans to install that in cars made by Chery Automobile Co.  \u201cWe are working with Chinese automakers and the Chinese ecosystem, as well as global automakers that sell vehicles in China,\u201d said Danny Shapiro, senior director of automotive at Nvidia.  One of those customers is Tusimple Inc., a Beijing-based startup developing self-driving trucks. Tusimple, set to start commercial operation of truck fleets in Arizona and Shanghai next year, is backed by investors including Nvidia.  \u201cWe are satisfied with Nvidia\u2019s chip, which has the strongest computing power for self-driving solutions,\u201d said Hou Xiaodi, Tusimple\u2019s chief technology officer.  Jerusalem-based Mobileye, bought by Intel last year for $15 billion, provides image sensing and processing technology for driver-assistance features. It wants to expand in China through its fourth-generation EyeQ chip and a mapping system called Road Experience Management, said Danielle Mann, a spokeswoman for Intel.  Mobileye will bring the mapping system to China via partnerships with SAIC Motor Corp. and Beijing-based digital map provider NavInfo Co.  Yet, China has the money and commitment to make itself a force in semiconductor development, just as it\u2019s doing now with electric vehicles.  China\u2019s industrial priorities include becoming a leader in advanced manufacturing businesses, including integrated circuits, 5G mobile communications, aircraft engines and new-energy vehicles, Premier Li Keqiang told the National People\u2019s Congress on March 5.  The government envisions spending about $150 billion in the next decade.  \u201cAll major governments around the world are deploying all kinds of resources in policies, talents and capital to upgrade their industries,\u201d Tsinghua University\u2019s Wei said. \u201cAnd China is no exception.\u201d  \u2014 With assistance by Yan Zhang, Ian King, Yuan Gao, and Ville Heiskanen", "stock": "INTC", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-25", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-25/china-seeks-its-own-brains-to-steer-30-million-autonomous-cars"}, {"article": "Car2Go and DriveNow were both originally started as ventures with established vehicle-rental companies, but Stuttgart-based Daimler and Munich-based BMW each bought out the other owners this year, setting the stage for a tie-up.  Daimler AG and BMW AG plan to merge their car-sharing operations as the world\u2019s biggest luxury-vehicle makers team up to take on ride-hailing providers such as Uber Technologies Inc.  The companies will form a 50-50 joint venture to include Daimler\u2019s Car2Go and BMW\u2019s DriveNow businesses as well as services including smartphone apps for calling taxis, locating parking spots and recharging electric autos, they said in a joint statement. Both carmakers raised full-year profit forecasts, saying earnings are likely to increase slightly if they can complete the deal in 2018, versus earlier predictions of flat figures.  The merger would allow Daimler and BMW to share the risk of operating in a tech-focused industry that includes a growing suite of rivals in mobility services. They\u2019re entering a rapidly changing environment that in the past week alone included a market and share-swap deal between Uber and Southeast Asian rival Grab, the U.S. company\u2019s struggles with a fatal accident involving a self-driving car test, and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Waymo unit agreeing to develop autonomous vehicles with Britain\u2019s Jaguar Land Rover.  The German luxury-car manufacturers are \u201caddressing the challenges arising from urban mobility and changing customer wishes,\u201d they said. The companies pledged to continue competing in their main businesses of building vehicles.  Original Partnerships  Car2Go and DriveNow were both originally started as ventures with established auto-rental companies, but Stuttgart-based Daimler and Munich-based BMW each bought out the other owners this year, setting the stage for a tie-up.  The combination is unlikely to pose antitrust issues, depending on how the market is classified, said Sven Diermeier, analyst at Independent Research GmbH.  The manufacturers are also joint investors in the HERE digital-mapping consortium, which includes Volkswagen AG\u2019s Audi luxury-car division as well as technology giant Intel Corp. and auto-parts suppliers Robert Bosch GmbH and Continental AG as partners.  The Daimler-BMW tie-up is \u201cgoing in the exactly right direction, because mobility services is developing into a large area,\u201d said Stefan Bratzel, director of the Center of Automotive Management at the University of Applied Sciences in Bergisch Gladbach, Germany. \u201cRight now, you can\u2019t earn money there, and there are a lot of infrastructure and overhead costs that can be combined.\u201d  Long Road to Profitability  BMW board member Peter Schwarzenbauer said the venture won\u2019t be profitable immediately.  \u201cWe put this together to really grow now, to scale it. The first objective is to become a big player, then it can be profitable,\u201d he said in an interview with reporters at the New York auto show.  The companies are considering rebranding the shared entity with a new name, but won\u2019t announce anything until the deal is approved by regulators. Schwarzenbauer declined to say how much BMW is investing in the venture.

The company skipped the traditional initial public offering process in favor of a route rarely taken by large, established companies. The stock rose 19 percent to $156.80 at 2:07 p.m. in New York from the $132 reference price set by the New York Stock Exchange well before the price discovery process started. While not an offer price, that was the threshold number set by the NYSE as the minimum for the process to begin.  Its first true public valuation based on share supply and demand was the open price of $165.90. From there, the stock is down 5.5 percent. Based on the total number of shares outstanding after the listing, Spotify has a market value of about $27.8 billion.  Spotify isn\u2019t selling any shares and there\u2019s no lockup period for company insiders or, with one exception, current shareholders. That means the company\u2019s first public share price, the open price, was set based purely on supply from existing shareholders wanting to sell stock and demand for those shares.  That\u2019s in contrast with an IPO, in which the company and potentially a few existing shareholders offer a set number of shares at a valuation they think the market will bear. Then underwriters hammer out how many shares investors want and at what price.

His briefings of Apple breakthroughs over the years were legendary, and featured huge visuals behind him as he paced the stage. He was not just an innovator but also a master communicator. When I had to give addresses back in my military days, I would dive into Carmine Gallo\u2019s \u201cThe Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs\u201d for inspiration.  Watching Russian President Vladimir Putin roll out a similar display of fearsome new weapons at his state of the federation speech the other day had the distinct feeling of watching a Steve Jobs-style brief put together by \"Q,\" the gadget-loving quartermaster from MI6, in a twisted James Bond movie. But this bag of tricks is neither a new iPhone nor an Aston Martin with machine guns, or even an exploding pen. Putin was talking about nuclear weapons moving toward the U.S. on a variety of new platforms. How seriously should we take this?  Let\u2019s put aside that the video's special effects seemed straight from a 1990s video game, and start with the purported weapons themselves. In each case, U.S. intelligence has been tracking the development of these systems over the past decade. There is a nuclear-tipped and nuclear-powered torpedo; a new generation intercontinental ballistic missile with longer ranges; a nuclear-powered cruise missile that could theoretically fly more or less forever and attack the U.S. from any location; an air-launched high-speed cruise missile; and a hypersonic glide missile capable of flying 20 times the speed of sound. He also mentioned new laser systems to deploy against U.S. weapons. He described several of the weapons as \u201cinvincible.\u201d  His motivation in hyping these systems is threefold. First, in the \u201call politics is local\u201d category, he has an election coming up on March 18. While he is predictably and comfortably in the lead in all the polls (fairly easy to do when your opponents are assassinated or jailed and you have complete media control), he still wants to play to his base, as the saying goes. Russians, like people everywhere, enjoy nothing so much as a big spectacle on a huge stage. Add to that a good bashing of Russia\u2019s enemy No. 1, and you have a sure winner.  Second, Putin is communicating with his circle of dictatorial allies and partners around the world. His message to Bashar al-Assad in Syria, Kim Jung Un in North Korea, and the ayatollahs in Iran (can you spell \u201caxis of evil\u201d?) is one of reassurance that someone can stand up to the U.S. in terms of global deterrence and high-end military technology. The demonstration is also a good way to enhance the sales of Russian weapons systems globally -- its producers are currently the second-largest supplier of weapons in the world and would love to surpass the U.S. Indeed, Russia exports as much as Germany, France and the U.K. combined, and triple what China sells globally.  Finally, Putin is sending a very direct signal to Washington. He hates U.S. and Western interference with Russia at any level, from the sanctions over the invasion of Ukraine and annexation of Crimea to the Olympic punishments meted out after the massive doping scandal. The intent here is simple and brutal: We are a nuclear power and can destroy your nation. The fact that the U.S. can do the same to Russia is not lost on Putin, but he will never miss a chance to remind the U.S. that Russia has an equally lethal nuclear arsenal.  In terms of serious military capability, last week's demonstration was a mixed bag. Nothing he displayed represented either a shock to the U.S. intelligence community or a significant change in the existing balance of nuclear and conventional power. Several of the systems have not been demonstrated publically, nor put into serious production. The most worrisome over time is probably the nuclear torpedo, but the idea of a Russian first-strike remains extremely remote. And it is hard to envision a scenario in which the U.S. decides to strike Russia. The odds are extremely high that we will continue along with the same deterrent regime that has kept the nuclear peace since the end of World War II: mutual assured destruction.  In terms of policy issues, Putin's display of braggadocio underscores several important points. First is that stepping up the U.S. conventional force posture in Europe is going to be critical to deterring Russia from using these kinds of weapons to threaten the Europeans. For a start, this means having a full four U.S. brigade combat teams in place and permanently stationed in Europe. We also must continue to push NATO allies to up their game in terms of forces that are combat-ready.  It also emphasizes the importance of avoiding an escalation on both sides, in terms of producing and deploying low-yield nuclear weapons, which could very quickly intensify in a tense scenario and cause Russia to use one of these strategic weapons -- what analysts refer to as the \"escalate to de-escalate\" doctrine. Finally, it will require the Pentagon to develop comparable systems to maintain deterrence, particularly hyper-sonic nuclear-tipped cruise missiles, where Russian progress is outstripping out own.  Another striking aspect of Putin's presentation was his hyper-vitriolic tone, even compared to his previous stridency on such occasions. Given that he will in all likelihood remain Russia's leader for life, we should pay significant attention to the uber-aggressive style of the display. It is hard to imagine any U.S. president in modern history, including even the current incumbent, depicting nuclear attacks on Russia on a large-screen display. It screams of a man desperate for respect, and such men can be very dangerous over time -- especially if they hold a relatively weak overall hand of cards.  And Putin does: Russia has profound demographic problems (also alluded to in Putin\u2019s speech); serious environmental challenges; a struggling economy highly concentrated on hydrocarbons; and few real allies in the world. In many ways, we should worry more about Russian weakness than Russian strength.  For the U.S., the best move with Russia remains simple and transactional: confront where we must (Ukraine, Syria, cyber-intrusions); but cooperate where we can. The latter includes counter-narcotics, counter-piracy, counterterrorism, Afghanistan, the Arctic and other mutual concerns. And there are reasonable \u201cTrack 2\u201d diplomatic options for the nations, such as exchanges between academic institutions, think tanks, laboratories and commercial entities.  We are not quite yet in a new Cold War, but it isn\u2019t hard to see one shimmering in the near distance. Most worrisome of all, U.S. and Russian military forces are in combat in close proximity in Syria, and we are watching our military jets and warships maneuvering at close quarters in the Black and Baltic Seas. We are one significant tactical mistake away from stumbling into real danger. Leaders on both sides need to take a deep breath and encourage their subordinates to do the same.

Government watchdogs are troublesome, but they help when it comes to thwarting a takeover.  Qualcomm Inc. has been stung by governments so often that the fines and scolding barely leave a mark anymore. Now, though, Qualcomm\u2019s government troubles come with a silver lining.  The chipmaker\u2019s latest regulatory run-in was with the European Union\u2019s antitrust body, which fined Qualcomm 997 million euros ($1.2 billion) for paying one of its customers, Apple Inc., to agree to use only Qualcomm\u2019s chips in its iPhones and iPads from 2011 to 2016. The EU antitrust authority said Qualcomm\u2019s arrangement amounted to an improper abuse of market power. Qualcomm said it disagreed with the EU decision and planned to appeal.  It\u2019s a familiar pattern for corporations. Governments tend to wade in when big technology companies become overwhelmingly powerful in their fields. It has happened to Microsoft, Intel and Google to varying degrees. The steely gaze of governments now seems to be turning to Facebook.  The distractions, financial penalties and expensive regulatory and legal skirmishes are the inevitable costs of market power, and Qualcomm knows this well by now. It has clashed with government authorities in South Korea, China, the U.S., and other countries over claims that Qualcomm abuses its dominance in the market for important smartphone components.  When the Chips Are Down Qualcomm's stock is trading below Broadcom's takeover offer of $70 a share, indicating doubts Broadcom can pull off the transaction Source: Bloomberg  Oddly, Qualcomm is now in a position where the government scrutiny helps its cause. Among Qualcomm\u2019s efforts to ward off an unwanted takeover attempt by fellow chipmaker Broadcom Ltd., the company has argued that regulators wouldn\u2019t clear the deal or that regulatory compromises would be too onerous. Yes, on the one hand Qualcomm has been fighting claims that it abuses its market power. And on the other, its size and market power help support Qualcomm's case against a Broadcom takeover.  Qualcomm's concerns are valid. If Broadcom and Qualcomm combine, the company would be the third-largest chipmaker in the world by revenue, behind Intel and Samsung. Broadcom has said that the companies' businesses don't overlap much, but the sheer size would certainly invite regulatory doubts.  And Broadcom has argued -- without much elaboration-- that it will be able to tackle Qualcomm\u2019s continuing government challenges by overhauling Qualcomm\u2019s contentious business model, which generates most of the company's operating profit from licensing patents. Apple and some of the government authorities have said that business model is a way for Qualcomm to overcharge customers.  Flexing Muscles If Broadcom acquires Qualcomm, the combined company would be the world's third-largest chipmaker by revenue Source: Bloomberg  One question is what customers think of the possible creation of an even more hefty chip supplier. The Wall Street Journal reported this month that three leading Chinese smartphone manufacturers are concerned about the Broadcom-Qualcomm deal because they worry a combination would result in higher prices for essential chips. In a rebuttal on Tuesday, Broadcom said that any antitrust concerns could be resolved and that Broadcom\u2019s customers supported an acquisition of Qualcomm.  It can't be fun for Qualcomm (or its stockholders) to see billions of dollars fly out of its coffers to mollify regulators. But Qualcomm must be smiling a little that government watchdogs are also helping the company's case against a takeover.

The flaws have rocked the tech world since Google engineers wrote a detailed description of the flaws on January 3. The vulnerabilities affect every major CPU maker, but Intel has taken the brunt of the impact as its chips are affected more than others.  The flaws are especially worrisome because they were built into Intel's hardware, making fixes to existing chips more challenging, but the company said it would begin shipping chips without the flaws later this year.  \"We've been working around clock,\" Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said. \"We're acutely aware we have more to do.\"  Intel did not detail the potential financial impacts of the flaws in its report, but analysts weren't really expecting the company to.  \"While Meltdown/Spectre could cause purchases to be postponed in 1H, it still too early to tell, and we doubt INTC will guide to such an event for fear of driving a self-fulfilling prophecy,\" John Pitzer, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said before the report.

The guidelines come amid scrutiny of a massive stock sale Intel CEO Brian Krzanich made last fall after his company found out about \u2014 but before it publicly disclosed \u2014 the Meltdown and Spectre attacks.  The agency advised companies to disclose such incidents to investors in a \"timely\" manner.  It also warned executives and directors not to trade in their companies shares in the time in between finding out about a \"material\" security problem and disclosing it to the public.  Intel CEO Brian Krzanich sold millions of dollars worth of company stock after his company became aware of the Spectre and Meltdown security vulnerabilities, but before they became public.  The Securities and Exchange Commission has a bit of advice for other executives thinking of doing something similar: Don't.  In new guidelines issued on Wednesday, the agency warned that security breaches and vulnerabilities could constitute \"material\" information, noting that it's illegal under US securities laws for insiders to trade stocks based on such information before it becomes public. Such sales may also violate companies' ethics and insider trading policies.  \"Directors, officers, and other corporate insiders must not trade a public company's securities while in possession of material nonpublic information, which may include knowledge regarding a significant cybersecurity incident experienced by the company,\" the SEC said in the guidelines.  It continued: \"Companies should have policies and procedures in place to [...] guard against directors, officers, and other corporate insiders taking advantage of the period between the company's discovery of a cybersecurity incident and public disclosure of the incident to trade on material nonpublic information.\"  Additionally, the SEC encouraged companies to disclose security breaches and vulnerabilities to investors in a \"timely fashion.\"  The new guidelines follow disclosures of the Meltdown and Spectre attacks  The guidelines come less than two months after Intel and other tech companies disclosed the Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities. Those vulnerabilities, which take advantage of a feature found in nearly all computer processors, could be used in cyberattacks that would allow malicious actors to steal private data stored on computers, such as passwords.  The exploits were of particular concern to Intel. The vulnerability they take advantage of has been present in nearly all Intel chips for the last 20 years. And while just about all processors found in smartphones, tablets, and PCs are vulnerable to the Spectre attack, few chips other than Intel's are at risk of the Meltdown attack.  Intel was notified of the attacks in June, but waited some seven months to disclose them. In between the company becoming aware of the processor security problems, and their public disclosure, Krzanich gained $24 million by selling all of the shares and options he was allowed to sell under his contract.  The company has said his stock sale was unrelated to the Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities, noting that it was done as part of a planned stock sale. But Krzanich put that plan in place just the month before \u2014 some five months after Intel became aware of the Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities.  Intel is facing some 35 lawsuits related to Spectre and Meltdown  Intel's handling of the disclosure of the exploits is now the subject of some 35 lawsuits, including a pair of shareholder derivative suits specifically related to Krzanich's stock sale.  Similar questions were raised about stock sales by Equifax executives made last year, in between the company becoming aware of a massive security breach and it disclosing that breach to the public.  It's unclear whether the SEC's new guidelines were prompted by either the Equifax or Intel security issues. The Justice Department is reportedly investigating the stock sales at Equifax. It's unclear whether the department or the SEC is investigating Krzanich's sale.  The guidelines don't represent new rules. Instead, they're essentially a clarification of existing ones. As such, the fact that the agency didn't issue them until Wednesday wouldn't bar it from investigating Krzanich's sale, even though that sale predated those guidelines.

At least one shareholder suit is taking aim at alleged insider trading at Intel; questions have been raised about a massive stock sale by the company's CEO after Intel was informed of the attacks but before it disclosed them to the public.  The Spectre and Meltdown attacks were a public relations nightmare for Intel. Now they've become a legal headache as well.  The chip making giant, its board members, and executives face 35 lawsuits related to the attacks, the company disclosed in its annual report on Friday. Because the suits are in their early stages, Intel said it couldn't determine how much they could potentially cost it.  \"We dispute the claims ... and intend to defend the lawsuits vigorously,\" the company said in its annual report.

The attacks were actually discovered in June, and Intel was made aware of them soon thereafter. The vulnerability the attacks exploit has been present in nearly all Intel chips made over the last 20 years. And, unlike chips made by other manufacturers, Intel's processors are vulnerable to both Spectre and Meltdown.  Intel's handling of Spectre and Meltdown has drawn criticism \u2014 and now lawsuits  Intel's handling of the situation has raised eyebrows not just because it waited more than six months to disclose the attacks to the public despite the fact that its chips were particularly at risk of them, but also because of a massive stock sale made by company CEO Brian Krzanich after the company found out about the attacks. In sale \u2014 through which Krzanich saw a $24 million windfall \u2014 the CEO sold off all of the shares of Intel he was allowed to sell under his contract.  Intel has noted that the sale, which Krzanich made in November, was done as part of a planned stock divestiture. But Krzanich only put that plan in place a month earlier, which was more than four months after Intel became aware of the attacks.  Thirty of the lawsuits filed against Intel are seeking class action status and were filed by customers who claim they were harmed by the attacks or by the company's failure to disclose them, according to the annual report. Two of the suits, also seeking class action status, were filed on behalf of shareholders who charge that the disclosure of the attacks shows that statements Intel made about its products or business were false or misleading.  Additionally, another three Intel investors have filed shareholder derivative suits in California state court, according to the annual report. Those suits charge that Intel's executives or directors failed in their duties to shareholders by delaying disclosure of the breach or not doing anything about insider trading at the company.

The FCC's Restoring Internet Freedom order will become active on April 23. The order will repeal the 2015 Net Neutrality rules.  3. Top artificial intelligence (AI) experts and policymakers from 14 institutions have published a report on the malicious uses of AI. The 100-page paper outlines digital, physical, and political dangers.  4. Intel reportedly failed to disclose Spectre and Meltdown flaws to US cybersecurity officials before the news leaked online. Both Apple and Alphabet, Google's parent company, as well as Intel, have said as much in letters sent to US congressmen.  5. Airbnb has debuted a new service called \"Airbnb Plus.\" The premium offering, active in 13 cities globally, has been designed to compete with hotels, and includes amenity-filled places that are professionally inspected and photographed.  6. Snap's stock slid over 6% after an analyst warned of negative reactions to the recent update. Also, Kylie Jenner's tweets that suggested that she uses the app less after the update may have contributed to the stock's fall.  7. Amazon is reportedly planning to open up to six new Amazon Go cashier-less stores this year. There is no clear indication about their location, but rumours say that they will most likely be in Seattle and Los Angeles.  8. Apple Pay has an estimated 38 million active users in the US and 127 million globally, up from 62 million a year ago. That, in turn, means that only about 16% of iPhone users worldwide use Apple Pay.  9. \"Angry Birds\" maker Rovio's stock has fallen over 50% to about \u20ac5 (\u00a34.4/$6.2), well below its original \u20ac11.50 (\u00a310.20/$14.20) IPO price. The revenue guidance for 2018 has been weak, too, with a maximum of \u20ac300 million (\u00a3265/$370 million) in forecast opposed to the \u20ac336 million (\u00a3292/$414 million) predicted by analysts.  10.

Amid the scramble, Intel, the company most affected by the flaws, has seen its stock price slump.  But, as the company prepares to report earnings soon, one analyst thinks the company will be fine in the near term.  Watch Intel's stock price move in real time here.    Spectre and Meltdown, arguably the two biggest flaws ever found in modern computers, might not have a big impact on the near-term earnings of Intel, the company hit the hardest by the flaws.  At least, that's the thinking of John Pitzer, an analyst at Credit Suisse.  \"While our calendar first quarter estimates embed NO negative impact to revenue from the Meltdown/Spectre security issues \u2013 near term we would highlight that the uncertainty created could cause at least some calendar first quarter server/client purchases to be deferred as IT managers look for more clarity,\" Pitzer said in a note to clients.  Spectre and Meltdown are flaws in a technique modern CPUs use to speed up computing. There are three total variations of the two flaws, and Intel is the only company whose chips have been reported to be affected by all three. The company has seen its share price decline about 8.73% so far this year after the flaws were disclosed publicly.  Pizter previously released a report the day after the flaws were disclosed that claimed everyone was making \"mountains from molehills\" regarding the flaws. A lot of new information about the flaws has surfaced since then, but Pizter is holding his ground, saying Intel's near-term revenue largely won't be affected.  There have been confusing and conflicting reports around the flaws since their public disclosure, however. AMD, which is Intel's main rival in the space, initially said its hardware would not be affected by the flaws, and later reversed its stance. Nvidia, which makes GPUs, created confusion when it issued Spectre and Meltdown patches for its products which were thought to be impervious to the flaws. Nvidia later clarified that its patches were only precautionary, and its products are not affected.  Patches to fix CPUs affected by the flaws were initially thought to slow down certain programs by as much as 30%, and an exact impact on performance has yet to be determined. Pitzer said IT managers and big data centers could delay planned purchases of Intel chips until more clarity is found, and the long-term effects of the flaws for chipmakers won't be evident for some time.  If certain companies' chips are found to be faster than others after all the final Spectre and Meltdown patches have been issued, there could be a sector-wide shift to the faster chips, Pitzer said.  Pizter has a \"neutral\" rating on Intel, but said it's mostly because he thinks the company is too expensive right now, not because of the potential risks associated with Spectre and Meltdown.  Intel reports fourth quarter earnings January 25, and Pitzer thinks the results will fall in line with Wall Street's expectations. Pizter is expecting earnings per share of $0.86 on revenue of $16.3 billion.

Millennials are buying shares 10 times more often than they are selling them, according to the Stockpile trading app.  Watch how the stock is moving in real time here.    Intel is set to report earnings after the bell on Thursday, and millennials are loading up on shares ahead of the report.  According to data from Stockpile, an app that allows trading of fractional stock shares, young investors on the app are buying Intel stock 10 times more often then they are selling. The company is currently the 46th most popular among millennials on the Stockpile app.  This is a surprisingly strong stance, given Wall Street's lukewarm feelings toward the stock recently. About 56% of the analysts surveyed by Bloomberg are bullish on the stock, while the other 43% are neutral or bearish.  Wall Street is perhaps more hesitant because of the uncertainty around recent security flaws that affect Intel chips. The company has been working to fix a decade's worth of security issues with its processors, dubbed Spectre and Meltdown. The recently disclosed security issues allow bad actors to exploit the way modern CPUs work to find sensitive information they wouldn't normally have access to. All the major CPU makers are affected by the flaws, but Intel has been hit the hardest.  When news of the flaws initially broke, investors flocked to Intel's rival, AMD, sending shares of the company up 16.29% this year. It's a stark contrast to Intel's shares which have slipped about 4%.  Ahead of the company's fourth-quarter earnings report, set to be released after the bell on Thursday, Wall Street is expecting adjusted earnings of $0.87 per share on revenue of $16.347 billion, according to data from Bloomberg.  Investors will likely be watching for comments on how the Spectre and Meltdown patches are coming along, and for more clarity about the flaws' impact on the company's business. Some analysts think it will likely impact the first quarter of 2018, but only because major chip buyers will delay their purchases until more clarity is found.

Mr. Ditzel helped popularize many of the same ideas and is now building a new RISC chip at a start-up called Esperanto.  Photo  Mr. Patterson and Mr. Hennessy were interested in simpler chips because they ran faster, consumed less power, made life easier for chip designers and allowed machines to evolve at a faster rate. In the mid-1980s, new RISC chips emerged from two Silicon Valley start-ups, Sun Microsystems and MIPS Technologies, becoming the standard for the computer workstations and servers that underpinned big corporate operations.  Those processors were eventually eclipsed by chips from Intel, which put its considerable muscle behind a competing design. But as computing expanded into smartphones, tablets, and other small devices \u2014 where power and space are at a premium \u2014 more and more chips used designs from a British company called ARM, short for Advanced RISC Machine.  As a book written by the two researchers in 1989, Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach, became the standard text for chip design, even Intel took a partial step toward the RISC idea. Its chips continued to use their own complex way of talking to a computer\u2019s software, but started to use some aspects of RISC.

But as these chips approach their physical limits, internet giants like Google, Facebook, and Amazon are pushing tasks onto a wide range of simpler processors that consume much less power, sparking a renaissance in chip design.  \u201cComplexity is even more of an enemy than it was before,\u201d Mr. Ditzel said. \u201cWe have to design differently.\u201d  Mr. Patterson and Mr. Hennessy are at the heart of this change. Their book is now in its sixth edition. Mr. Hennessy is on the board of directors of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, after serving as the president of Stanford for 16 years.

The Democratic memo is said to contend that the F.B.I. was more forthcoming with the surveillance court than Republicans had claimed. Republicans allege that the bureau did not disclose to the court that information from a former British spy, Christopher Steele, that was used in the warrant application had been partly financed by the Democratic National Committee and lawyers for Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign.  People familiar with the document have said it also rebuts Republican claims that Andrew G.

But even though the president said the memo had vindicated him, in reality it did nothing to clear him of either collusion with the Russians or obstruction of justice \u2014 the lines of inquiry being pursued by Mr. Mueller. The memo in fact undermined some Republicans\u2019 efforts to cast doubt on the roots of the investigation by confirming that the inquiry was already underway before law enforcement officials presented the Steele information in obtaining the warrant to conduct surveillance on Mr. Page.  On Sunday, several Republicans on the Intelligence Committee distanced themselves from Mr. Trump\u2019s statements.

The people familiar with the Democratic document say that it reveals that while the F.B.I. did not name the Democratic National Committee and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign as having funded the Steele research, the bureau disclosed to the court that the information it had received from him was politically motivated. That, the Democratic memo says, gave the judge in the case the information he needed to make a decision about its usefulness.  The memo is also said to argue that Republicans distorted the testimony by Mr. McCabe, the F.B.I. official, and left out reams of other evidence included by the F.B.I. to support the bureau\u2019s suspicions that Mr. Page was acting as an agent of Russia. Mr. McCabe in fact presented the material as part of a constellation of compelling evidence that raised serious suspicions about Mr. Page, a former Moscow-based banker who had been on the F.B.I.\u2019s radar for years, according to those familiar with the memo.

Beijing swung into action. It banned government offices from installing the most recent version of Microsoft Windows, and antitrust investigators raided Microsoft\u2019s offices. Cisco, Apple and Intel products were removed from state lists that officials use as guides when buying equipment. Qualcomm got slapped with a $975 million fine for anticompetitive behavior.  The political pressure sent American companies scrambling to link up with Chinese partners, leading to joint ventures of the sort that the Trump administration, and some in the American business community, have decried as unfair.

They\u2019ve got the time, are in the mood. They may want today to go a little more hard in the paint, as the expression goes, and lay in good eating for tonight and the rest of the week.  Like, for instance, you could make this great Ottolenghi chocolate cake this afternoon. It\u2019ll leave you feeling like you\u2019re fancy and deserving, like you live in Islington, in London, and have a house account at Yotam\u2019s shop on Upper Street. Take that cake to work in the morning in a cake carrier, and you\u2019ll be spring-season royalty, in Maine as in Marylebone. I might even do that myself, once the cobwebs clear.

The debate receded when the Trump administration took office, but in recent months top officials like Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, and Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, have begun talking publicly about the \u201cgoing dark\u201d problem.  The National Security Council and the Justice Department declined to comment about the internal deliberations. The people familiar with the talks spoke on the condition of anonymity, cautioning that they were at a preliminary stage and that no request for legislation was imminent.  But the renewed push is certain to be met with resistance.  \u201cBuilding an exceptional access system is a complicated engineering problem with many parts that all have to work perfectly in order for it to be secure, and no one has a solution to it,\u201d said Susan Landau, a Tufts University computer security professor. \u201cAny of the options people are talking about now would heighten the danger that your phone or your laptop could be hacked and data taken off of it.\u201d  Craig Federighi, the senior vice president of software engineering at Apple, stressed the importance of strengthening \u2014 not weakening \u2014 security protections for products like the iPhone, saying threats to data security were increasing every day and arguing that it was a question of \u201csecurity versus security\u201d rather than security versus privacy.  \u201cProposals that involve giving the keys to customers\u2019 device data to anyone but the customer inject new and dangerous weaknesses into product security,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWeakening security makes no sense when you consider that customers rely on our products to keep their personal information safe, run their businesses or even manage vital infrastructure like power grids and transportation systems.\u201d  But some computer security researchers believe the problem might be solvable with an acceptable level of new risks.

While it largely described challenges to solving the problem, one section cited presentations by several technologists who are developing potential approaches.  They included Ray Ozzie, a former chief software architect at Microsoft; Stefan Savage, a computer science professor at the University of California, San Diego; and Ernie Brickell, a former chief security officer at Intel.  Photo  According to several people familiar with the new round of deliberations, those three men have been participating in a series of workshops convened at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Daniel Weitzner, a computer science professor. They have discussed their research with government officials, including Valerie Cofield, a senior F.B.I. science and technology official working on \u201cgoing dark\u201d issues.  The researchers, Mr. Ozzie said, recognized that \u201cthis issue is not going away,\u201d and were trying to foster \u201cconstructive dialogue\u201d rather than declaring that no solution is possible.  Mr. Savage said the talks had focused on trying to create a safe enough way to unlock data on encrypted devices, as opposed to the separate matter of decoding intercepted messages sent via encrypted communications services, like Signal and WhatsApp.  Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Data in motion and the cloud are much harder to deal with.\u201d  The deliberations shed new light on public remarks by Trump administration officials in recent months. In October, Mr. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, argued in a speech that permitting technology companies to create \u201cwarrant-proof encryption\u201d was endangering society.  \u201cTechnology companies almost certainly will not develop responsible encryption if left to their own devices,\u201d he said. \u201cCompetition will fuel a mind-set that leads them to produce products that are more and more impregnable. That will give criminals and terrorists more opportunities to cause harm with impunity.\u201d  And Mr. Wray, the F.B.I. director, has twice given speeches this year in which he pointed to Symphony, an encrypted messaging system for banks. Pushed by a state regulator, several banks agreed to give copies of their Symphony keys to law firms. Because Symphony keeps a copy of encrypted data on its servers, that arrangement created a backup means for investigators to gain access to the messages if necessary.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  \u201cAt the end, the data in Symphony was still secure, still encrypted, but also accessible to the regulators so they could do their jobs,\u201d Mr. Wray told a cybersecurity conference in Boston this month. \u201cI\u2019m confident that by working together and finding similar areas to agree and compromise, we can come up with solutions to the \u2018going dark\u2019 problem.\u201d  The Symphony approach, however, would not work for millions of ordinary smartphone users. But one alternative being worked on by Mr. Ozzie and others is receiving particular attention inside the government.  The idea is that when devices encrypt themselves, they would generate a special access key that could unlock their data without the owner\u2019s passcode. This electronic key would be stored on the device itself, inside part of its hard drive that would be separately encrypted \u2014 so that only the manufacturer, in response to a court order, could open it.  Law enforcement officials see that idea as attractive in part because companies like Apple are already trusted to securely hold special keys permitting them to push operating system updates to devices like iPhones.  Still, Ms. Landau argued that creating such a system would create significant additional security risks. She noted, among other things, that updates are relatively rare but police would want seized phones opened every day \u2014 so many more tech company employees would need access to the powerful new keys, increasing the risk of theft or abuse.  The Obama administration never agreed on asking for legislation mandating access mechanisms. Military and cybersecurity agencies worried that weakening security would create new problems, and commerce officials worried about quashing innovation and making American tech products less competitive.  Still, in 2016, the Obama administration\u2019s deliberations also came to focus on the idea of access keys on devices, a participant said, but stalled because of difficult technical questions about the details. They included how to prevent criminals from deleting the access keys on their devices or from using phones that do not have the mechanism because they run on outdated software or were built for foreign markets.  But one Justice Department official familiar with the deliberations contended that it might not be necessary to come up with a foolproof system, arguing that a solution that would work for ordinary, less-savvy criminals was still worth pursuing.  Mr. Brickell, the former Intel official, echoed that view. Enforcing compliance with a rule that devices must have access mechanisms to function \u201cis a difficult problem,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s keep working on it.

Ms. Sanders referred questions about the security clearance process \u2014 and why Mr. Porter was allowed to continue working at the White House for so long despite the abuse accusations \u2014 to the F.B.I. and the intelligence agencies, saying they are the ones that handle the background checks and the granting of permission to handle classified information.  \u201cIt\u2019s up to those same law enforcement and intelligence agencies to determine if changes need to be made to their process,\u201d she said.  The F.B.I. had no comment on Monday.  The finger-pointing has frustrated Democratic members of Congress, who have pushed to gain visibility into the security clearance procedure at the White House.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina and the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, has refused to ask the White House for any information about security clearances or for a formal briefing on the matter, Democrats on the panel said Monday. He has also refused to allow the committee to vote on three subpoenas proposed by Democrats, including one on interim clearances.  Mr. Gowdy\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment.  In a letter sent last week, Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the top Democrat on the committee, pressed Mr. Gowdy to more aggressively tackle the security clearance issue, saying that news of Mr. Porter\u2019s problems had given the matter renewed urgency.  \u201cIf you had agreed to any of our previous requests for information on these matters, the White House would have been required to answer key questions about why Mr. Porter was denied a final security clearance,\u201d Mr. Cummings wrote.  \u201cInstead, because of your multiple refusals, we did not find out about any of these issues until they were reported in the press,\u201d he added.  The process for allowing White House officials to work with secret, classified material typically begins when West Wing employees are subjected to a brief background check and are granted interim clearance. A full background check by the F.B.I. and, in some cases, the C.I.A. then begins.  Officials with previous administrations said it is not uncommon for the full background checks to take as long as eight months or a year, in part because of a long backlog in vetting the backgrounds of people needing clearance across the federal government.  Video  Background checks take about a year for Pentagon employees and six to seven months for prospective C.I.A. or National Security Agency workers, a senior American official said.  But several former White House officials said it is also common for administration officials to encourage the investigators to give top priority to senior presidential aides like Mr. Porter and Mr. Kushner.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  What Mr. McGahn and other top White House officials learned about the allegations against Mr. Porter, and when they learned it, remains murky.  Mr. Porter told Mr. McGahn in January 2017 that there could be what he described as false allegations against him, according to two people briefed on the situation. In June, the F.B.I. informed the White House security office that allegations of domestic abuse had surfaced. Mr. McGahn was made aware at the time that there was an issue with Mr. Porter\u2019s background investigation, but relied on the security office to continue pursuing the background check.  White House officials disputed that assertion, saying on Monday that Mr. McGahn was not made aware during the summer of any problems with Mr. Porter\u2019s clearance.  In November, the bureau delivered a thick file on Mr. Porter\u2019s background check to the security office and relayed that he was not likely to succeed in getting a permanent clearance, according to one person briefed on the case. Security office officials encouraged the F.B.I. to complete its investigation so the office could make a final determination on Mr. Porter\u2019s clearance.  One person briefed on the situation, who had insisted on anonymity to discuss private deliberations, said late last week that the bureau had informed Mr. McGahn when the file was delivered that the allegations against Mr. Porter were likely to derail his security clearance. But on Monday, the person said that he had been mistaken, and contended that Mr. McGahn had not learned of the F.B.I.\u2019s communications to the security office until much later.  In Mr. Kushner\u2019s case, a final decision about a permanent security clearance is also still pending.  Mr. Lowell said that it should not be surprising that someone with \u201cthe extent of his holdings, travels and lengthy submissions\u201d would require a lengthy background check. But he took issue with the suggestion that the delays somehow affect Mr. Kushner\u2019s ability to do his job at the White House.  \u201cThis is just the latest,\u201d he said, \u201cin unnamed sources quoting secondhand hearsay concerning Mr. Kushner that, like the others, will be shown to be untrue.\u201d", "stock": "INTC", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-13", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/12/us/politics/white-house-security-clearances-jared-kushner.html"}, {"article": "Intel and Qualcomm are fierce rivals and Intel has been working to chip away at Qualcomm\u2019s strong position in making equipment for wireless devices, namely those from Apple Inc. Qualcomm and Apple have been in a bitter licensing dispute and Apple lately has switched to Intel chips in a portion of its devices. Should Broadcom succeed in buying Qualcomm, it could smooth over relations with Apple, closing a door to further possible gains from Intel.  A Broadcom deal would be Intel\u2019s biggest acquisition by far\u2014and should it pursue one, there is no guarantee regulators would bless it. Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., and with a market value of nearly $240 billion, has been acquisitive in recent years as it looks to diversify away from its core business of powering the personal-computer industry, which is in decline.  Last year, Intel bought Israeli car-camera pioneer Mobileye NV for roughly $15.3 billion in a bet on connected cars. In 2015, it struck its largest deal ever when it bought Altera Corp. for $16.7 billion. Intel hoped that buying Altera, a maker of programmable chips, would help bolster its position in server systems and other equipment found in data centers and telecommunications networks, the company said at the time, as well as fuel its plans surrounding the so-called Internet of Things.  In the most recent piece of drama surrounding Broadcom\u2019s bid to buy Qualcomm, the effort was dealt a setback when the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or CFIUS, indicated it has concerns about the takeover and would review it.  That appeared to lengthen the odds that Broadcom and its chief executive, Hock Tan, would succeed in their pursuit of Qualcomm, which has rejected the $117 billion offer as too low.  Separately, Qualcomm has in place its own pending $44 billion deal to buy NXP Semiconductors NV, which it sweetened in February, a move Broadcom criticized.  Qualcomm and Broadcom unleashed dueling announcements Friday as each sought to win support from regulators and shareholders during the takeover fight.  Qualcomm, looking to assert its board\u2019s independence, said Paul Jacobs would no longer be executive chairman. Mr. Jacobs, the son of Qualcomm co-founder Irwin Jacobs, will remain on the board. Current board member Jeffrey Henderson was named nonexecutive chairman.  Broadcom has been seeking to replace a majority of Qualcomm\u2019s board members to help pave the way for a deal. A vote on the directors that was slated to take place this past Tuesday at Qualcomm\u2019s annual meeting was pushed back a month at CFIUS\u2019s behest.  Broadcom, meanwhile, pledged that if it succeeds in acquiring its target, it wouldn\u2019t sell \u201cany critical national security assets to any foreign companies.\u201d The assurance was a nod to U.S. concerns that a takeover could weaken Qualcomm\u2019s position\u2014and therefore the country\u2019s standing\u2014as a leader in developing next-generation 5G cellular technology.  Broadcom late Friday said it will ask shareholders to vote March 23 to approve the company\u2019s plan to redomicile from Singapore to the U.S., potentially setting the stage for a showdown with CFIUS as the vote would take place in the middle of the panel\u2019s review of Broadcom\u2019s bid.  If Broadcom were considered a U.S. company, its acquisition would arguably fall outside of the panel\u2019s jurisdiction, though CFIUS could say it still has jurisdiction to review the bid since it began the review while Broadcom was a Singapore company.  Should Broadcom fail in its bid for Qualcomm, it is possible Intel would stand down, happy with the status quo.  Underlying the maneuvering is a battle among chip companies to be the chief supplier of critical cellular components to smartphone makers such as Apple and Samsung Electronics Co.  Qualcomm is a leader in chips that run apps and manage cellular communications in smartphones. It competes with Broadcom in chips for short-range wireless networking, including Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, and radio filters and other chips that condition cellular signals.  Intel, which dominates the market for the calculating engines in personal computers and data-center servers, missed the mobile revolution when its chips proved too power-hungry for battery-dependent cellphones. But Intel\u2019s cellular communications chips lately have displaced Qualcomm\u2019s in a portion of Apple\u2019s iPhones, and the company has been moving aggressively to develop that product line.  Acquiring Broadcom would give Intel a suite of smartphone chips, adding to its own communications chips the Singapore-based company\u2019s radio filters as well as Bluetooth and GPS components.  Broadcom sells a diverse line of equipment for networking and communications\u2014including technology for smartphones from Apple and Samsung\u2014as well as data storage, electronic displays and set-top boxes. Broadcom, like Qualcomm, is a so-called fabless chip company, designing processors while relying on manufacturers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to actually make them.  Under Mr. Tan, Broadcom has pursued a string of acquisitions. The company was formed when Avago Technologies Ltd. in 2015 agreed to buy the former Broadcom for roughly $37 billion and kept its name. Broadcom\u2019s revenue was twice the size of Avago\u2019s at the time of the merger.

INTC -1.63% reported record growth in fourth-quarter revenue as sales in its data-center business jumped 20%, while the company swung to a quarterly loss as it booked a $5.4 billion charge after recent changes in U.S. tax law.  Overall revenue rose 4% to $17.05 billion. Intel reported a $687 million loss, compared with a profit of $3.56 billion a year earlier, largely because of the tax impact.  The company said it expects a 2018 tax rate of 14%, compared with an adjusted rate of 23% in 2017, which doesn\u2019t account for the tax impact.  The chip giant also announced a 10% rise in its annual dividend to $1.20 a share.  Sales in the division responsible for server chips and other data-center gear\u2014a critical area as personal-computer sales wane\u2014climbed to $5.6 billion. That pushed full-year growth in the segment to 11%, above Intel\u2019s goal of high single-digit growth for 2017.  In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Intel finance chief Bob Swan attributed the growth to demand from cloud vendors and communications networks, as well as surprisingly strong sales to corporate data centers, which had been sluggish.  \u201cWe saw strong customer demand for high-performance products across the board,\u201d he said. He cautioned, however, he doesn\u2019t expect the rising pace of sales to corporate customers to continue.  Intel\u2019s report Thursday came as the company continues to work on closing recently disclosed security holes in virtually all its processors.  The company has said that it doesn\u2019t expect the security flaws to affect its finances, but questions linger about just how seriously customers are affected, especially those that operate large data centers, and what redress they might demand. At the outset of the company\u2019s conference call with analysts, Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said Intel is working around the clock to fix the flaws, but conceded that \u201cwhile we\u2019ve made progress, I am acutely aware that we have more to do.\u201d  In the personal-computer division, where Intel faces stepped up competition from Advanced Micro Devices Inc., sales fell 2%, in line with the quarter\u2019s drop in PC shipments tallied by industry researcher Gartner Inc.  Intel has been trimming costs to keep margins up as it transitions from PCs to a broader technology portfolio. It has pledged to bring annual operating expenses to 30% of revenue by 2020. In the quarter, it cut those costs to 31% of revenue, compared with 34% in the year-earlier period and averaging 33.7% for the year.  The company also posted strong growth in some areas where it has been seeking to expand its market, though the businesses for now are much smaller than PC and data-center chips.  Sales of programmable chips, which can be reconfigured on the fly, were up 35%, while sales of chips for a variety of items known as the Internet of Things, were up 21%. Memory, where Intel is investing heavily, achieved profitability, Intel said, though sales growth slowed to 9%, a slightly steeper drop than some analysts expected.  Intel shares were up 3.5% after hours, having fallen 0.5% to $45.30 in regular New York trading. Through Thursday\u2019s close, the stock was up 29% since late July, when surging second-quarter revenue and profit sparked investor confidence that the company could overcome its challenges.  The company\u2019s forecast for the current year was for profit of about $3.55 a share on an adjusted basis, on revenue of about $65 billion, compared with $3.46 a share in adjusted profit and $62.8 billion in revenue for 2017.  Intel reported per-share earnings of $1.08 for the quarter on an adjusted basis, which excludes the tax-law impact and other items such as restructuring and acquisition-related costs. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had expected adjusted profit of 86 cents a share on $16.35 billion in revenue.  \u2014Maria Armental contributed to this article.

INTC -1.63% is considering buying Broadcom Ltd. AVGO 3.14% , a company valued at more than $100 billion, shows the depth to which the chip giant feels threatened by a potential tie-up between Broadcom and its rival Qualcomm Inc. QCOM 0.96%  Since late last year, Intel has been exploring a bid for Broadcom to forestall that company\u2019s $117 billion offer for Qualcomm in what would be the biggest-ever tech deal, people familiar with the matter told The Wall Street Journal in an article published Friday. Intel\u2019s interest in derailing that deal reflects its worry that a combined Broadcom-Qualcomm, which would create the third-largest chip company by revenue after Intel and Samsung Electronics Co., would endanger its competitive position, the people said.  A merged Broadcom and Qualcomm would combine market-leading smartphone chips with a strong presence in data centers, two areas Intel has targeted for growth. And Qualcomm\u2019s own proposed purchase of Dutch automotive chip specialist NXP Semiconductors NV would turbocharge such a merger in the automotive market, where Intel has placed one of its biggest bets.  \u201cYou\u2019d have this powerhouse going up against you,\u201d said analyst Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein Research, noting the combined revenue of Broadcom and Qualcomm\u2014nearly $40 billion in fiscal 2017\u2014would be formidable even relative to Intel\u2019s $63 billion in the same year. Nonetheless, he finds an Intel-Broadcom merger unlikely.  There are several reasons why such a combination may not happen. Intel is weighing a range of alternative acquisitions, the Journal reported Friday, and a hostile Broadcom offer would present enormous challenges of financing, complexity and regulatory scrutiny.  Intel has made relatively few big deals in its 49-year history\u2014the largest was in 2015 when it acquired Altera Corp. for $16.7 billion\u2014and it has previously had a spotty track record of folding them in.  Intel in a statement said its focus is on integrating its recent purchases and \u201cmaking them successful for our customers and shareholders.\u201d The company declined to comment further.  An Intel-Broadcom tie-up may not even make sense in terms of strengthening Intel, according to some analysts. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any benefit to Intel,\u201d said Handel Jones, a consultant at International Business Strategies. In particular, he said, Broadcom\u2019s products wouldn\u2019t mesh well with Intel\u2019s manufacturing operations, where the chip giant could use additional volume to reduce costs.  But the prospect that Intel could bid for Broadcom reflects tectonic forces reshaping the semiconductor industry as chips make their way into all manner of consumer and industrial products, from smart speakers to urban infrastructure.  Intel, with a market capitalization of about $243 billion, holds over a 90% share in its core markets of processor chips in personal computers and data-center servers, according to Mercury Research, leaving it scant room to grow in those areas as PC shipments continue their persistent decline.  Intel has responded, in part, by moving aggressively into cellular communications chips, where it has replaced Qualcomm units in a portion of Apple Inc.\u2019s iPhones and made inroads with the next-generation 5G cellular specification.  It has advanced into the automotive industry with its $15.3 billion purchase of Mobileye NV, a leader in sensors for assisted-driving features like automated lane keeping and collision avoidance.  And it has doubled down on its data-center business, supplying companies like Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. that are spending tens of billions annually on hyperscale cloud-computing facilities.  Hitching Broadcom, whose management style has driven a sevenfold increase in its share price over five years, to Qualcomm, whose products form the bedrock of the mobile market, could threaten Intel\u2019s progress in all three areas.  Broadcom declined to comment. Qualcomm didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.  Qualcomm has focused on developing key cellular technology, playing a leadership role in 5G. That research keeps its chips ahead of the competition, and it has resulted in a patent portfolio that yields a royalty on nearly every smartphone sold, whether or not they contain Qualcomm chips\u2014a revenue stream that typically provides most of Qualcomm\u2019s pretax profit.  Since early 2017, though, Qualcomm has been in a bitter legal war with Apple over its royalty rates, which the iPhone maker alleges are unfair. Qualcomm hasn\u2019t been able to resolve the conflict quickly, and Apple is considering replacing Qualcomm chips entirely with products from rivals including Intel.  Broadcom also sells chips to Apple, and its chief executive, Hock Tan, claims to have a strong relationship with the iPhone maker. If Broadcom takes over Qualcomm, he believes he could resolve the Apple dispute. In that case, Apple could boost Qualcomm\u2019s presence in iPhones at Intel\u2019s expense, especially as 5G ramps up in coming years.  A combined Broadcom-Qualcomm also could wreak havoc on Intel\u2019s ambitions in self-driving cars. Qualcomm\u2019s acquisition of NXP awaits antitrust approval in China, its final regulatory hurdle, which Qualcomm has said it expects soon. Completing the purchase would pave the way for Qualcomm\u2019s 5G chips and self-driving tech. The extra heft that Broadcom would give that combination could create a counterweight to Intel and Mobileye.  Broadcom also sells switches to makers of data-center equipment, while Qualcomm is pushing into data centers with server processors that compete directly with Intel\u2019s. The prospect of selling Qualcomm\u2019s server chips through Broadcom\u2019s data-center channels may give Intel pause.  And Mr. Tan likely wouldn\u2019t stop there. He built Broadcom on a string of ever bolder acquisitions. Having rolled up Qualcomm\u2014if his takeover effort gets that far\u2014he could continue to enlarge his portfolio of market-leading franchises, potentially blocking Intel\u2019s efforts at every turn.  \u2014Dana Mattioli  and Dana Cimilluca contributed to this article.

Intel\u2019s decision to inform Chinese technology companies about security flaws in its processors raises concerns that the information could have reached the Chinese government before being publicly divulged. Photo: steinba/EPA/Shutterstock  In initial disclosures about critical security flaws discovered in its processors, Intel Corp. INTC -1.63% notified a small group of customers, including Chinese technology companies, but left out the U.S. government, according to people familiar with the matter and some of the companies involved.  The decision raises concerns, security researchers said, as it potentially could have allowed information about the chip flaws, dubbed Spectre and Meltdown, to fall into the hands of the Chinese government before being publicly divulged. There is no evidence any information was misused, the researchers said.  Weeks after word of the flaws first surfaced, Intel\u2019s choices about who would receive advance warning continue to ripple through the security and tech industries.  The flaws were first identified in June by a member of Google\u2019s Project Zero security team. Intel had planned to make the discovery public on Jan. 9\u2014people working to protect systems from hacks often hold off on announcements while fixes are devised\u2014but sped up its timetable when the news became widely known on Jan. 3, a day after U.K. website the Register wrote about the flaws.  Because the flaws can be leveraged to sneak sensitive data out of the cloud, information about them would be of great interest to any intelligence-gathering agency, said Jake Williams, president of the security company Rendition Infosec LLC and a former National Security Agency employee. In the past, Chinese state-linked hackers have exploited software vulnerabilities to get leverage on their targets or expand surveillance.  It is a \u201cnear certainty\u201d Beijing was aware of the conversations between Intel and its Chinese tech partners, because authorities there routinely monitor all such communications, Mr. Williams said.  Representatives from China\u2019s ministry in charge of information technology didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. The country\u2019s foreign ministry has in the past said it is \u201cresolutely opposed\u201d to cyberhacking in any form.  An Intel spokesman declined to identify the companies it briefed before the scheduled Jan. 9 announcement. The company wasn\u2019t able to tell everyone it had planned to, including the U.S. government, because the news was made public earlier than expected, he said.  Intel\u2019s tricky path\u2014inform enough big customers to head off significant damage while keeping the information as contained as possible to limit potential leaks\u2014continues to weigh on smaller companies that weren\u2019t given an early nod.  Joyent Inc., a U.S.-based cloud-services provider owned by Samsung Electronics Co. , is still playing catch-up, said Bryan Cantrill, the company\u2019s chief technology officer.  \u201cOther folks had a six-month head start,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re scrambling.\u201d  In the months before the flaws were publicly disclosed, Intel worked on fixes with Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google unit as well as \u201ckey\u201d computer makers and cloud-computing companies, Intel said in an emailed statement to The Wall Street Journal.  An official at the Department of Homeland Security said staffers learned of the chip flaws from the Jan. 3 news reports. The department is often informed of bug discoveries in advance of the public, and it acts as an authoritative source for information on how to address them.  \u201cWe certainly would have liked to have been notified of this,\u201d the official said.  The NSA was similarly in the dark, according to Rob Joyce, the White House\u2019s top cybersecurity official. In a message posted Jan. 13 to Twitter, he said the NSA \u201cdid not know about these flaws.\u201d A White House spokesman declined to comment further, referring instead to the tweet.  Chinese computer maker Lenovo Group Ltd. LNVGY -0.87% was among the large tech companies, including Microsoft Corp. , Amazon.com Inc. and ARM Holdings in the U.K., that were notified of the flaws beforehand.  Lenovo was able to issue a statement Jan. 3 advising customers on the flaws because of \u201cthe work we\u2019d done ahead of that date with industry processor and operating system partners,\u201d a spokeswoman said in an email.  Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA -2.21% , China\u2019s top seller of cloud-computing services, also was notified ahead of time, according to a person familiar with the company.  A spokeswoman for Alibaba\u2019s cloud unit declined to comment on when the company was informed. She said any idea that the company might have shared information with Chinese authorities was \u201cspeculative and baseless.\u201d  A Lenovo spokeswoman said Intel\u2019s information was protected by a nondisclosure agreement.  Despite the security concerns, an early heads up to a select number of large global companies made sense, said Dave Aitel, chief executive of Immunity Inc., a company that sells security services. \u201cThey\u2019re going to tell as few people as possible\u201d to contain possible leaks, he said.  Because they had early warning, Microsoft, Google and Amazon were able to release statements soon after news of the flaws leaked out saying their cloud-computing customers were largely protected.  Smaller competitors, though, continue to struggle. DigitalOcean Inc., a cloud-services seller, said Jan. 19 it was still testing a fix for its customers. Rackspace Inc. said last Wednesday it has several teams working on a fix. The cloud company earlier in January told customers it understood the situation \u201ccan be frustrating.\u201d  The DHS also stumbled with its initial guidance. The agency\u2019s Computer Emergency Response Team first linked to an advisory stating the only way to \u201cfully remove\u201d the flaws was by replacing the chip. CERT now advises users instead to patch their systems.  The DHS should have been looped in early on to help coordinate the flaws\u2019 disclosure, Joyent\u2019s Mr. Cantrill said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why CERT would not be your first stop,\u201d he said.

SES SA will join Intelsat SA\u2019s campaign to keep serving customers in a chunk of the C-band. Photo: handout/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images  Two top commercial satellite operators agreed to team up on a plan to clear some of their wireless spectrum for use by other companies, a move they say will spur new telecom investment.  SES SA said it will join Intelsat SA\u2019s I 2.02% campaign to keep serving U.S. customers in a chunk of the C-band, a swath of airwaves in the middle of the broader radio spectrum, while allowing other wireless operators to take over a smaller sliver of the band. The companies said they serve about 90% of the U.S. market in the C-band, which media companies use to beam video to cable companies for distribution.  The success of the satellite companies\u2019 proposal, also backed by computer chip maker Intel Corp. INTC -1.63% , will affect how quickly the U.S. adopts fifth-generation, or 5G networks. Several telecom companies are jostling for increasingly scarce spectrum licenses that could support connected cars, medical equipment and other gear that would be constantly connected to the wireless network.  The plan could still face opposition from wireless carriers that would prefer to move all satellite operators off the band entirely. Satellite companies have said that is a non-starter.  \u201cIt would not really be feasible to say, \u2019Hey move to another band, we\u2019re using this now,\u2019\u201d Intelsat Chief Executive Steve Spengler said in an interview. \u201cSatellite operators have built satellites specifically for this. There\u2019s a huge investment that\u2019s already in place today.\u201d  The focus now shifts to the Federal Communications Commission. The agency has yet to launch a rule-making process for the spectrum but is expected to start in the coming months. Satellite companies say they could start moving their operations to a narrow section of the band about two years after that process starts.  \u201cI\u2019m not persuaded that there is a better path than the one we\u2019ve created,\u201d SES CEO Karim Sabbagh.  If the plan succeeds or the FCC auctions off all of the spectrum, there will likely be plenty of takers.  A much-maligned pitch for a new government-backed 5G network focused heavily on the C-band. The proposal\u2019s authors argued it was the broadest and most useful radio frequency available to U.S. policy makers looking to jump-start 5G infrastructure investment.  Government officials quickly disavowed that plan, which included an idea for a nationalized government-run network, but the band is still the subject of intense private-sector interest.  \u201cIt really is the sweet spot for wireless operators to think about,\u201d said Tim Farrar, a telecom analyst at industry research TMF Associates. He noted that wireless operators like Sprint Corp. have locked up many other licenses that could serve the same purposes. \u201cIt\u2019s not the beachfront property, but it\u2019s a hotel with vacant rooms.\u201d  Write to Drew FitzGerald at andrew.fitzgerald@wsj.com", "stock": "INTC", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-09", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/satellite-operators-pitch-plan-to-share-airwaves-1518132645"}, {"article": "Hours after we published an editorial Friday about the Justice Department\u2019s refusal to turn over a document subpoenaed by the House Intelligence Committee, Chairman Devin Nunes (R., Calif.) received an official response from Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd.  It was cleverly spun. Mr. Boyd played up the access to the secondary information Mr. Nunes had demanded\u2014access to the application and renewals for the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants on one-time Trump associate Carter Page. Mr. Boyd describes his department\u2019s response as \u201cextraordinary accommodation.\u201d  Upon inspection, however, the focus on the FISA warrants looks more like an effort to distract attention from Mr. Boyd\u2019s refusal even to mention Mr. Nunes\u2019s main request of FBI Director Christopher Wray and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. That request was for the \u201celectronic communication,\u201d or memo, that officially launched the counterintelligence investigation into alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.  On Friday Trey Gowdy, an Intel Committee member who has seen a redacted form of the memo, said Justice has redacted the \u201cgood stuff.\u201d He means information that would tell whether the counterintelligence investigation was credible, and how and whether the FBI vetted the information. \u201cAll of that,\u201d Mr. Gowdy said, \u201cis in a paragraph I can\u2019t read.\u201d  Justice says the blacked-out paragraph can\u2019t be shared with Congress because it identifies a foreign country that shares intelligence with the U.S. This is a hard argument to credit, given that in December someone told the New York Times that Australian diplomat Alexander Downer was the source for the information that minor Trump campaign official George Papadopoulos had bragged about Russian dirt on Hillary Clinton. In February former CIA Director John Brennan referred to the FBI\u2019s relationship with British intelligence when asked about the information on Mr. Papadopoulos.  Mr. Nunes needs this information because it is crucial to understanding whether Justice and the FBI had good reason to launch this investigation\u2014and how they handled it. The Papadopoulos narrative matters to the FBI, because attributing the launch of the investigation to him minimizes the role of the now infamous Steele dossier.  Some suspect that the real reason Justice is keeping this paragraph secret is because it might reveal embarrassing facts about how the Papadopoulos information was used. This might include a role for political actors (rather than intelligence officials) in ginning up the Trump-Russia investigation.  Meanwhile, on Saturday President Trump asked in a tweet what \u201cJustice and the FBI have to hide\u201d? He added, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t they giving the strongly requested documents (unredacted) to the HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE?\u201d\u2014which has subpoenaed similar information about FBI actions during the 2016 election.  The President might ask the same about the stonewalling of the Intel Committee. Do Mr. Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions think that ignoring the committee\u2019s main request is in the spirit of the \u201cextraordinary accommodation\u201d that Mr. Boyd claims?

Committee Chairman Devin Nunes owes ranking Democrat Adam Schiff a thank you for assisting his case.  The 10-page Democratic memo begins by declaring that \u201cThe FBI and DOJ officials did not \u2018abuse\u2019 the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) process, omit material information, or subvert this vital tool to spy on the Trump campaign.\u201d Yet the facts it lays out show the opposite.  In particular the memo confirms that the FBI used an opposition-research document paid for by the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee as part of its application to surveil Carter Page, who was associated with the Donald Trump campaign.  Democrats dispute the degree to which the FBI relied on the dossier created by opposition-researcher Christopher Steele in applying for its FISA court order, but that\u2019s beside the point. If the FBI had as much \u201ccompelling evidence\u201d and \u201cprobable cause\u201d as the memo asserts, it would not have needed to cite the Steele document. And the Democrats do not dispute that the Steele dossier was the FBI\u2019s only source in its initial FISA application for its allegation that Mr. Page met with suspect Russians in Moscow in July 2016.  The Democratic memo makes no attempt to rebut the widely reported news that former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe told Congress that the FBI would not have sought a surveillance warrant without the dossier. Democratic Rep. Jim Himes claimed on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that Mr. McCabe never said that, but then why not put that in the memo?  The Democratic memo also confirms that the FBI withheld from the court the partisan provenance of the dossier. Democrats even provide, for the first time in public, the precise language the FBI used in its initial application in a long, obfuscating footnote.  Democrats say the FBI told the FISA court that a \u201claw firm\u201d [Clinton/DNC firm Perkins Coie] hired \u201can identified U.S. person\u201d [oppo-research firm Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson ] to \u201cconduct research regarding Candidate #1s ties to Russia.\u201d The \u201cidentified U.S. person\u201d then hired \u201cSource #1\u201d [Mr. Steele] to do the research. The footnote ends: \u201cThe FBI speculates that the identified U.S. person was likely looking for information that could be used to discredit Candidate #1\u2019s campaign.\u201d  Speculates? Likely? Could? The dossier was paid for by actors whose overriding purpose was to defeat Mr. Trump. Nowhere do Democrats say the FBI used the words \u201cpolitical\u201d or \u201cpartisan\u201d or \u201ccampaign,\u201d much less Clinton or Democratic National Committee.  The Democratic memo claims the FBI acted \u201cappropriately\u201d in not \u201crevealing\u201d the name of an \u201centity\u201d in a FISA application, but this is laughable. The FBI sometimes masks identities to preserve sources and methods, but the Steele dossier was a pastiche of gossip and rumor based on Mr. Steele\u2019s contacts. Disclosing his partisan funders would have betrayed no important intelligence sources but would have given the court reason to ask the FBI for more credible information before granting an eavesdrop order.  Messrs. Steele and Simpson briefed their media friends in September and October about their dossier, despite FBI prohibitions. The FBI nonetheless falsely told the court that Mr. Steele wasn\u2019t the source of a Yahoo News article that it used as additional evidence in its application. While the Democratic memo repeatedly refers to Mr. Steele\u2019s reporting as \u201creliable\u201d and \u201ccredible,\u201d it confirms that the FBI fired Mr. Steele after it found he hadn\u2019t told the truth about his media spinning.  The Democratic memo devotes considerable space to smearing the hapless Mr. Page, as if he\u2019s some kind of master spy and the Rosetta Stone of the Trump-Russia story. Yet no one has offered proof that he colluded with the Russians, and he hasn\u2019t been indicted.  Democrats also make much of the fact the FBI started looking into the Trump campaign in July 2016 but didn\u2019t receive \u201cSteele\u2019s reporting\u201d until \u201cmid-September.\u201d So what? The issue here is the fairness and honesty of the FISA application in late October (not the investigation), and what matters is that the FBI didn\u2019t move on the FISA application until after it received the dossier.  ***  The only definitive evidence of political \u201ccollusion\u201d so far is that the Clinton campaign paid Mr. Steele to troll his Russian sources for dirt on Donald Trump. The FBI then used this dirt as a reason to spy on Mr. Page and anyone he was communicating with.

WSJ's David Pierce has a few tricks and tips to pull yourself back into the real world. Photo/Video: Emily Prapuolenis/The Wall Street Journal  When smartphones came to steal our attention, we never had a chance. Even in the rare moments we manage to put them down, they buzz incessantly, begging us to come back.  It\u2019s fine for phones to be engrossing when we\u2019re bored on a layover. More often they should help us work or exercise or find a Starbucks , then get out of the way.  Now, more than a decade into the smartphone era, investors, activists and customers alike have begun to push phone makers, especially Apple Inc., AAPL 0.34% to find a way to solve phone addiction.  The feature we need already exists: It\u2019s called Do Not Disturb. Whether you use an iPhone or an Android device, you have a one-tap way to shut your phone up. Do Not Disturb should be every smartphone user\u2019s best friend and saving grace. Instead, it\u2019s a relic of a long-gone era, a feature that doesn\u2019t work the way we do.  The iPhone\u2019s \u2018Do Not Disturb\u2019 feature shuts off nearly everything. You can engage it manually or schedule your silence ahead of time. Photo: David Pierce/The Wall Street Journal  Apple launched Do Not Disturb in 2012 to keep your phone from waking you up in the middle of the night. When you tap the moon icon, your phone instantly shuts up. Your notifications are visible if you wake up your phone, but it won\u2019t buzz or light up automatically. There are only small nuances: You can name contacts who can call you\u2014no texts get through when Do Not Disturb is engaged\u2014or allow anyone who calls twice to buzz through on the second call.  Last year, the company launched Do Not Disturb While Driving, which engages when your phone connects to your car stereo or its motion sensors detect driving. It allows alarms and timers\u2014and Apple Maps navigation\u2014but generally keeps the screen dark. Anyone who messages you can receive an automatic response.  The problem is that this dichotomy\u2014you\u2019re either on or off, zero or 100\u2014doesn\u2019t actually represent how people use their phones. When you\u2019re sleeping, you might want total quiet. But what about at work, when you\u2019re still reachable but trying to focus on your presentation instead of incessant ESPN updates? Or when the people you care most about would rather use WhatsApp or Snapchat, instead of calling you? Turning on Do Not Disturb is like taking your landline phone off the hook to keep it from ringing.  Apple\u2019s \u2018Do Not Disturb While Driving\u2019 allows you to auto-respond to texts so your friends won\u2019t wonder why you\u2019re not replying. Photo: David Pierce/The Wall Street Journal  Do Not Disturb should have a sort of volume meter, from 0 to 10. When you\u2019re bored on the couch, turn the knob all the way up and let the distracting notifications flow. When you\u2019re asleep go to 0: silence is golden. In between, users ought to be able to control what gets through and when.  At work you need buzzes for your calendar, email and Slack, but would rather not have Candy Crush luring you back in before lunchtime. There should be an \u201cI\u2019m in a meeting\u201d setting, and a \u201cGet me out of this meeting\u201d one, too.  Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google does this better. Android\u2019s Do Not Disturb, launched in 2014, has a Total Silence mode, but also offers Priority Mode. With that engaged, only the apps you\u2019ve handpicked can buzz your phone. My friends can message me on all the apps I use, but Starbucks can\u2019t tell me about deals, and Twitter can\u2019t suck me back into my timeline. Android also allows you to let calendar notifications or reminders through the Do Not Disturb wall.  Google could do more; Apple could do much more. Users should be able to set their own rules. Studies have shown that when people reduce notifications, they worry they\u2019re missing important things. By ensuring you\u2019re seeing the things that matter, and shutting up the (many, many more) things that don\u2019t, Do Not Disturb could address this.  Android users can set rules for \u2018Do Not Disturb,\u2019 allowing certain apps or people through the wall. Photo: David Pierce/The Wall Street Journal  At the same time, Android and iOS should begin automatically managing your phone\u2019s distractions. They could differentiate between morning and evening, weekend and weekdays. Android can engage Do Not Disturb in sync with your calendar events, but it can\u2019t tell whether you\u2019re bored in the dentist\u2019s waiting room or stressing in a job interview. Devices could use their knowledge of your location, calendar and activity to figure out exactly how much you can be bothered.  Apple and Google are the only companies in a position to make this work at the system level. Third-party developers can\u2019t access the control they\u2019d need, across apps and services, to regulate the whole system. (And would you want them to?)  How to Do \u2018Do Not Disturb\u2019 Set a schedule . You can make Do Not Disturb turn on at the same time every day\u2014maybe after dinner, when it\u2019s time to relax\u2014and off again in the morning.  .

The California Democrat serves as ranking member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, a powerful oversight panel. Recently this committee succeeded in wresting key documents from the Justice Department and FBI after months of being stonewalled, and Republican staffers have summarized the info in a classified four-page memo. Those who have read the memo say it includes evidence of abuses by Justice and FBI officials handling the investigation into Donald Trump\u2019s alleged ties with Russia, most salaciously summed up in the infamous Steele dossier named for the former British spy who compiled it.  But whether it\u2019s material submitted to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court for a warrant on a Trump campaign official or conveniently missing texts between an FBI agent and his FBI mistress\u2014who both hated Mr. Trump and would each serve on the special counsel\u2019s team\u2014Mr. Schiff exhibits no interest. Saturday on CNN he implied that the only ones who are interested are Russian bots on Twitter .  When CNN\u2019s Ana Cabrera asked him why not let the American people see the info and decide for themselves, Mr. Schiff went full Jack Nicholson : \u201cThe American people, unfortunately, don\u2019t have the underlying materials and therefore they can\u2019t see how distorted and misleading this document is,\u201d he answered. Translation: The American people can\u2019t handle the truth.  It makes no sense. If the American people lack context, that\u2019s an argument for more disclosure, not less. But it fits a pattern. Mr. Schiff tells us there is \u201cmore than circumstantial evidence\u201d of collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow. But he never produces it.  To put it another way, Mr. Schiff appears to be the only man in America who doesn\u2019t seem to want to know whether the material in the Steele dossier is true or not. All along he has stood against getting relevant information\u2014fighting subpoenas for Justice, fighting subpoenas for the FBI, and fighting the subpoena for the bank records of Fusion GPS (which ultimately prompted the admission that the Clinton campaign had helped fund the Steele dossier).  Last week offered a good example of the Schiff standard in operation. Democrats wanted the House testimony of Fusion co-founder Glenn Simpson made public, and Republicans on the Intel committee joined them to vote in favor of releasing it. But when it came to making the classified memo available to any congressman who wished to read it, Republicans alone stood for transparency. Every Democrat, led by Mr. Schiff, voted to keep the memo secret.  On the Saturday following this vote, the chairmen of three key House oversight committees\u2014 Devin Nunes (Intel), Bob Goodlatte (Judiciary) and Trey Gowdy (Oversight)\u2014met to discuss the way forward. They released no statement. But as more of their members see the memo, the rumbling to make the information public will only grow.  Meanwhile, even Democrats not on the Intel Committee have been infected by the same lack of curiosity that afflicts Mr. Schiff. In the few days since the memo became available to every member of the House, roughly 190 Republicans have read it, compared with only a dozen Democrats.  Congress\u2014especially the oversight committees\u2014is supposed to act as the people\u2019s watchdog. Mr. Trump is routinely slammed for his indifference to reading, especially the endless memos and policy papers that find their way onto a president\u2019s desk. But what does it say when the ranking member of a vital oversight committee appears uninterested in what his committee has unearthed about a matter that speaks to the integrity of our highest institutions of law enforcement?  The Beltway standard for comparison for scandal today is Watergate. It\u2019s now been nearly five decades since men affiliated with Richard Nixon\u2019s Committee for the Re-Election of the President were nabbed while breaking into Democratic headquarters at the Watergate complex. The purpose of the break-in was to plant a bug and gain embarrassing intel on the Democratic Party and its presidential candidate, George McGovern.  If Mr. Trump and his team worked with Vladimir Putin to steal the 2016 election from Hillary Clinton, it would indeed be as scandalous as Watergate. But it would be just as scandalous if a Democratic administration\u2019s Justice Department and FBI used unsubstantiated opposition research\u2014parts of which were quite possibly drawn from Russian disinformation\u2014to obtain warrants to spy on members of a Republican presidential campaign.  In 1972, Nixon press secretary Ron Ziegler dismissed the break-in as a \u201cthird-rate burglary.\u201d Today Mr. Schiff routinely dismisses the House Intel Committee findings about Justice and the FBI\u2019s handling of the Steele dossier as \u201ca profound distraction\u201d\u2014while he too fights an investigation into a presidential election. Could that be why he\u2019s so opposed to letting the American people see what he\u2019s seen?

The Netflix charge was one of the first public signs of financial cost to a studio or production company following allegations of sexual misconduct against an individual.  The source with knowledge of the matter said the charge was related to Spacey\u2019s projects. Spacey\u2019s representatives did not respond to a request for comment on Monday.

Cannes festival director Thierry Fremaux said last month that Netflix had refused to give its movies theatrical distribution in France and would therefore be banned from competition at the 12-day festival. However, Thierry said Netflix could show movies outside competition.  Netflix will not participate as a non-competitor, Sarandos told Variety. \u201cI don\u2019t think there would be any reason to go out of competition. The rule was implicitly about Netflix, and Thierry made it explicitly about Netflix when he announced the rule.\u201d  \u201cWe want our films to be on fair ground with every other filmmaker,\u201d Sarandos added. \u201cThere\u2019s a risk in us going in this way and having our films and filmmakers treated disrespectfully at the festival.

The company has released a few films, like fantasy thriller \u201cBright,\u201d starring Will Smith, in a small number of theaters. But most major chains have refused to show Netflix movies because it releases them at the same time online. Movies from traditional studios typically run exclusively in cinemas for about three months.  Sarandos said he personally would not attend the May 8-19 festival in the French Riviera, but said Netflix executives would be there looking at films to acquire.  Netflix said it had nothing to add to Sarandos\u2019 comments to Variety.  The annual festival, which began as an art house showcase more than 70 years ago, has increasingly attracted more commercial movies and top celebrities to its red carpets.  Cannes organizers announced last week that the latest \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie \u201cSolo: A Star Wars Story\u201d would get its world premiere at the festival on May 15 ahead of its worldwide rollout on May 23.  \u201cFilm festivals are to help films get discovered so they can get distribution,\u201d Sarandos told Variety. \u201cUnder those rules, we could not release our films day-and-date to the world like we\u2019ve released nearly 100 films over the last couple of years.\u201d  Netflix won five Oscar nominations earlier this year for its period racial drama \u201cMudbound,\u201d while its film \u201cIcarus\u201d about Russian sports doping won best documentary.", "stock": "NFLX", "label": 1, "date": "2018-04-11", "source": "reuters", "url": "https://ca.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idCAKBN1HI2ZN-OCAEN"}, {"article": "(Reuters) - Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) is offering more than $300 million to buy a company that owns billboards across Los Angeles, including on West Hollywood\u2019s famed Sunset Strip, a move that could help it save money maintaining a high profile in the world\u2019s entertainment capital, according to people familiar with the matter.  The purchase of Regency Outdoor Advertising, if successful, would be the largest yet for the fast-growing Silicon Valley streaming video company, which has a studio in Hollywood and is now one of the world\u2019s biggest film and TV producers.  Netflix\u2019s motivation was not immediately clear, but it could save money over time with the deal, according to industry analysts, as it ramps up spending on marketing for its original shows and movies to $2 billion this year. Netflix used Regency Outdoor billboards to promote its \u201cStranger Things\u201d and \u201cThe Crown\u201d drama series.  A billboard ad on Los Angeles\u2019s Sunset Strip can cost $140,000 per month, said Barry Lowenthal, president of The Media Kitchen, a New York-based media buyer.  \u201cThis is a smart move for Netflix because it is a very important viewing market,\u201d Lowenthal said. \u201cLos Angeles matters to the people in the industry.\u201d  Tech firms Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Hulu and Facebook Inc (FB.O) and traditional media companies such as Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) are all vying with Netflix to win subscribers.  Netflix is just one of the bidders for Los Angeles-based Regency Outdoor and there is no certainty that its offer will prevail, the sources said this week, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential.  Netflix declined to comment. Its shares were close to unchanged in a slightly lower market. Regency Outdoor did not respond to a request for comment.

REUTERS/Mike Blake  ANALOG ADS, DIGITAL CONTENT  The world\u2019s leading streaming media company still uses physical advertising space such as billboards to promote its shows. Billboards are holding their own compared to other forms of traditional advertising such as ads in newspapers or TV that are easy to skip.  Regency Outdoor, owned by brothers Drake and Brian Kennedy, owns billboards on Sunset Strip, a portion of Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles known for its live music and night clubs and filled with splashy billboards promoting upcoming TV shows and movies.  It also has billboards at Los Angeles International Airport, on major freeways, near the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) campus, and close to the Los Angeles Angels baseball stadium, according to the company\u2019s website.  Netflix said in a letter to shareholders earlier this year that its marketing spending was growing \u201ca little faster\u201d than its revenue.

The purchase of Regency Outdoor Advertising, if successful, would be the largest yet for the fast-growing Silicon Valley streaming video company, which has a studio in Hollywood and is now one of the world\u2019s biggest film and TV producers.  Netflix\u2019s motivation was not immediately clear, but it could save money over time with the deal, according to industry analysts, as it ramps up spending on marketing for its original shows and movies to $2 billion this year. Netflix used Regency Outdoor billboards to promote its \u201cStranger Things\u201d and \u201cThe Crown\u201d drama series.  A billboard ad on Los Angeles\u2019s Sunset Strip can cost $140,000 per month, said Barry Lowenthal, president of The Media Kitchen, a New York-based media buyer.  \u201cThis is a smart move for Netflix because it is a very important viewing market,\u201d Lowenthal said. \u201cLos Angeles matters to the people in the industry.\u201d  Tech firms Amazon.com Inc, Hulu and Facebook Inc and traditional media companies such as Walt Disney Co are all vying with Netflix to win subscribers.  Netflix is just one of the bidders for Los Angeles-based Regency Outdoor and there is no certainty that its offer will prevail, the sources said this week, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential.  Netflix declined to comment. Its shares were close to unchanged in a slightly lower market. Regency Outdoor did not respond to a request for comment.  ANALOGue ADS, DIGITAL CONTENT  The world\u2019s leading streaming media company still uses physical advertising space such as billboards to promote its shows. Billboards are holding their own compared to other forms of traditional advertising such as ads in newspapers or TV that are easy to skip.  Regency Outdoor, owned by brothers Drake and Brian Kennedy, owns billboards on Sunset Strip, a portion of Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles known for its live music and night clubs and filled with splashy billboards promoting upcoming TV shows and movies.  It also has billboards at Los Angeles International Airport, on major freeways, near the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) campus, and close to the Los Angeles Angels baseball stadium, according to the company\u2019s website.  Netflix said in a letter to shareholders earlier this year that its marketing spending was growing \u201ca little faster\u201d than its revenue.  As a result of the bigger marketing expenditure, Netflix\u2019s expenses per subscriber will jump around 25 percent to $16 per subscriber, up from $13 per subscriber, according to a recent MoffettNathanson report.

Investors, left nervous after major indexes slumped into correction territory at the start of the month but still confident about the health of the U.S. economy, are doubling down on already popular companies expected to post above-average earnings growth. Many of those are businesses poised to benefit from consumers and companies with more money to spend and invest as a result of U.S. tax cuts enacted this year.  Among such stocks, Amazon has climbed 2.7 percent since the end of January and Netflix has increased 4.9 percent, both outperforming the S&P 500\u2019s 3.3 percent decline.  \u201cInvestors are willing to pay a premium for go-go tech stocks that can deliver returns in any environment,\u201d said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors in Chicago. \u201cPeople are going to stay home and eat popcorn and watch movies on Netflix no matter what.\u201d  Analysts on average expect Amazon to increase its adjusted, non-GAAP earnings per share by 82 percent this year.

That compares with expectations for S&P 500 aggregate earnings to expand by an unusually strong 19.1 percent in 2018, helped by a tax cuts and a stronger economy, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  In terms of their earnings valuations, Amazon and Netflix appear exceptionally expensive compared with most stocks. Amazon recently traded at 155 times earnings expected over the next 12 months, while Netflix traded at 94 times expected earnings, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Overall S&P 500 earnings grew about 12.8 percent in 2017 and are seen increasing another 17.9 percent this year.

Fourth-quarter sales grew by a third to $3.29 billion, the company said, while earnings almost tripled from a year prior to 41 cents, meeting estimates.  Netflix will plow all of that and more into new TV shows and movies. The company has said it will spend as much as $8 billion on programming this year, and disclosed Monday it will shell out another $2 billion for marketing. Netflix is also dramatically increasing its non-English programming, with plans to release 30 local language productions in 2018.

Netflix signed up 8.33 million customers in the fourth quarter, surpassing analysts\u2019 estimates of 6.34 million, thanks in large part to the popularity of the fantasy series \u201cStranger Things\u201d and the new Will Smith movie \u201cBright.\u201d  That success has inspired Facebook Inc., Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. to try their hand at original programming. It has also spurred rivals like Walt Disney Co. to invest more in online services and acquire competitors. Yet Netflix enjoys a head start on all those players.  International Gains  International territories accounted for the bulk of the subscriber growth and hold the key to Netflix\u2019s future, with additions of 6.36 million topping the 5.05 million average of analysts\u2019 estimates. Netflix said Rodolphe Belmer, the chief executive officer of Paris-based Eutelsat Communications SA, will join its board.  The U.S. business, where growth had been slowing, also showed vigor. The company signed up 1.98 million new customers at home, up from a year ago and beating analysts\u2019 projections of 1.29 million, according to Bloomberg data.

Netflix will burn through as much as $4 billion in cash this year and said it will borrow again. Critical analysts continue to wonder when spending will level off.

Canada\u2019s second-most populous province said Tuesday it would make the collection of the provincial sales tax mandatory for suppliers of goods and services based outside Quebec to put them on par with local rivals. Quebec expects the measures will enable it to recover C$155 million ($120 million) in lost revenue over five years, according to budget documents released in Quebec City.  A failure to collect taxes on online sales of goods and services to companies outside the province now costs Quebec about C$270 million annually, according to estimates by the provincial finance ministry. Most of the money, or C$158 million, pertains to goods such as shoes and clothes purchased abroad, Finance Minister Carlos Leitao said Tuesday.  An agreement between Los Gatos, California-based Netflix and the federal government over filming in Canada provoked widespread outrage in Quebec last year, in part because it didn\u2019t subject the company to a sales tax. That sparked the ire of Canadian media companies that must apply the tax, including on streaming units they set up to compete with Netflix.  \u201cFor services, Netflix and others, we are proposing legislative measures that will force these companies to register for our provincial sales tax regime,\u201d Leitao said Tuesday at a press conference in Quebec City. \u201cThey will need to collect the sales tax and to send it to us.\u201d  For companies selling goods online, Quebec will follow the approach recommended by the Organization for Economic Co- Operation and Development, which is to collect taxes at the border, Leitao said.  Starting Jan. 1, foreign companies that sell more than C$30,000 a year in taxable supplies of goods or services to Quebec consumers will be required to register for the provincial sales tax, budget documents show. Until now, suppliers without a physical or significant presence in the province weren\u2019t required to register for the tax, or to collect or remit it.  Canadian companies that don\u2019t have a physical or significant presence in Quebec will get eight more months to adjust: they won\u2019t be required to register for the provincial sales tax until Sept. 1, 2019.  \u201cGiven the Canadian economy\u2019s high level of integration, a potentially significant number of businesses of all sizes may be impacted,\u201d the finance ministry\u2019s document says.  Premier Philippe Couillard, who is running for re-election in October, is following up on a pledge to collect the money from online sellers after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau ruled out additional taxes. The C$270 million that is eluding Quebec\u2019s coffers represents about 1.3 percent of annual sales tax receipts, according to the government.

At 6 percent, its ratio is significantly lower than those of higher-rated media companies such as Walt Disney Co. and Viacom Inc.  \u201cIf you\u2019re in Netflix\u2019s position, it\u2019s something you should talk about,\u201d Flynn said. \u201cIt\u2019s the best way to position your credit profile.\u201d  A representative from Netflix declined to comment.  Subscriber Growth  The world\u2019s largest online TV network reported its strongest year of subscriber growth to date, propelling its market capitalization in line with the likes of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Qualcomm Inc. Its shares jumped as much as 13 percent to $257.71 in New York.  Yet splurging on new shows comes at a cost. The company has said it will spend as much as $8 billion on programming this year, and disclosed Monday it will shell out another $2 billion for marketing. Long-term debt stood at $6.5 billion at year-end, while long-term content liabilities totaled $3.33 billion.  The stock surge prompted multiple equity analysts to raise their price targets on the stock, but the optimism wasn\u2019t shared by all. Matthew Harrigan, an analyst at Buckingham Research Group, downgraded the stock to neutral from buy, saying he\u2019s skeptical that the company can replicate its domestic success abroad, especially in Asia where the local competition is dense and Netflix lacks pricing power.  \u201cYou\u2019ve got to step back and do a sanity check on this,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a great product and are competing with other great media companies. But this isn\u2019t like Amazon, where it has the opportunity to take over the world with AI and penetrate every retail category.\u201d  Chief Financial Officer David Wells said on an earnings call late Monday that as the company continues to build its content, some of the factors influencing its working capital needs have started to moderate.  \u201cAs our operating profit grows, we\u2019ll be able to pay more for that organically,\u201d he said.  Content and subscriber growth are the roots to Netflix\u2019s success, which is why it\u2019s hard to see the company pulling back from that to help turn cash flow positive, said Rahim Shad, a high-yield analyst at Invesco Ltd.  \u201cWith Hulu and Amazon making their own strides in original content, you almost have to spend your way to remain relevant and successful at this game,\u201d Shad said in an interview. The upside case for the bonds would be a takeover by an investment-grade company like Apple Inc., as Disney plans to acquire a majority of 21st Century Fox Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. is already developing its own content, he said.  Netflix also said it doesn\u2019t expect the new limitation on interest deductibility in the recently passed U.S. tax law to affect its business. That aspect of the law has been seen to deal a blow to junk-rated companies, especially those rated B and lower.

A small but loud #DeleteNetflix campaign has burst forth on Twitter since \"The Mechanism,\" a show that is a work of fiction based on the real-life, multi-year corruption probe dubbed Carwash, was added to the streaming service Friday. Ex-users are posting proof of their now-defunct accounts in one of Netflix\u2019s most successful international markets.  Former President Dilma Rousseff, who was impeached in 2016 amid fallout from the scandal, called the show \"underhanded and full of lies.\" Prominent movie critic Pablo Villaca said he canceled his subscription after six years and encouraged others to do the same, saying the decision to air the show was \"irresponsible.\"  \"The director invents facts. He doesn\u2019t merely reproduce fake news. He has turned himself into a creator of fake news,\" according to a post on Rousseff\u2019s website. \"It would be like if a movie about the last moments of John Kennedy inserted a Lee Harvey Oswald character making accusations against the victim. Or a movie where Winston Churchill makes a deal with Adolf Hitler to attack the United States.\"  The debacle took over local media, with director Jose Padilha, who also produced the Netflix hit \"Narcos,\" responding that critics are too focused on the details and missing the bigger picture.  While this isn\u2019t the first portrayal of the corruption probe that continues sweeping through Brazil\u2019s political and business elite, the timing of the release -- on the day the operation hit its 50th phase -- has helped fuel some of the reaction.  After successive scandals that almost took down a second president in as many years, most of Congress and the presidency will be up for grabs in general elections in October. On Monday, former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva had a 12-year prison sentence for corruption confirmed by an appeals court. He awaits a Supreme Court ruling that will determine whether or not he will be arrested, and with that, influence the role he will play in the elections.  Lula leads all voter polls, and he has repeatedly reiterated his innocence and denounced the Carwash investigation as political persecution, saying he will fight until the very end.  Sergio Moro, the judge who became the face of the Carwash probe and hailed by some Brazilians as a savior of sorts for locking up corrupt politicians and businessmen, said in an TV interview Monday that while there are artistic liberties in both the movie and the show, drawing attention to Brazil\u2019s issue with corruption is important.  The show changed the names of those involved in the case -- Petrobras, as the state-run oil company at the center of the investigation is known, became Petrobrasil. Alberto Youssef, Brazil\u2019s black-market central banker who was one of the to be caught up in the probe, is portrayed as Roberto Ibrahim.  One of the biggest points of controversy is a conversation in which a politician -- who resembles Lula -- talks about an agreement to prevent the corruption probe from proceeding. The episode alludes to a political crisis surrounding President Michel Temer, which took down then-Planning Minister Romero Juca after a recording of a similar conversation between himself and a former executive linked to Petrobras emerged.  \"The left was and is just as corrupt as the right. \u2018The Mechanism\u2019 has no ideology,\" Padilha is cited as saying in Estado de S.Paulo newspaper.  Netflix is no stranger to Brazilian political drama. The company placed large ads at the Brasilia airport -- the nation\u2019s capital, where much of the Carwash probe has taken place -- to promote the latest season of House of Cards. When news broke in May that a businessman had secretly recorded the president allegedly discussing hush money in a fresh round of scandal that almost took down the government, that show\u2019s profile tweeted -- in Portuguese -- \"It\u2019s getting hard to compete.\"  On Tuesday, Netflix\u2019s official Twitter account in Brazil posted a video with a mock ad for a \"corruption store\" featuring products such as fashionable covers for ankle monitors and underwear with pockets to better store bribes.  Netflix didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment on the impact of the show, viewership or subscription data.  \u2014 With assistance by Paula Sambo, and Fabiola Moura", "stock": "NFLX", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-27", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-27/-deletenetflix-campaign-erupts-in-brazil-over-corruption-show"}, {"article": "Netflix Inc. is lifting the curtain on just how much the sexual harassment controversy is going to cost Hollywood.

The rapid pace of subscriber additions is impressive, but so is the amount of cash going up in flames.  Netflix Inc. is the Uber of the entertainment programming business. Whether Netflix investors recoil or cheer at the comparison depends on their risk tolerance.  Netflix doesn't share Uber's inclination to push boundaries, and it has a well-functioning business. But both companies are impressive growth machines that rely on outside funding to maintain the momentum. And in both cases, it's not clear what the real trajectory of the business would look like if access to capital dried up.  First, let's run through the impressive growth part of the Netflix machine.  Growing Like a Weed Netflix keeps adding streaming video subscribers rapidly Source: Bloomberg  Netflix said on Monday that it added 8.3 million more subscribers than it lost for its streaming service. That was the most new streaming customers in Netflix's history. Even in the U.S., where analysts believe more than half of households with fast internet service already subscribe to Netflix, the company added more net new streaming customers in 2017 than it did the year before. The continued pace of customer additions validates both Netflix's recent decision to raise prices on many subscribers in the U.S. and to go all-in on a globalization strategy the company unveiled two years ago.  But just like at Uber, growth comes at a cost for Netflix. That cost is the piles of money Netflix has set alight for three years to finance its globe-trotting ambitions, and to purchase -- rather than rent -- more of the TV shows and movies the company makes available to streaming subscribers. The cash costs for Netflix's streaming programming reached $8.9 billion in 2017, about double the costs from two years earlier. The number of Netflix streaming customers hasn't increased as much, at about 60 percent, over that period.  Bonfire Netflix's free cash flow has turned negative in the last three years as the company splurged on programming and international expansion Source: Netflix  Netflix also said its free cash flow would widen to as much as negative $4 billion in 2018, compared with an already stunning negative $2 billion in 2017. Netflix has already been clear it won't generate positive cash flow for years as it tries to become the preferred entertainment source for the world, and one that has profitable economics. But potentially burning through $4 billion in cash is staggering. Netflix and Uber are betting that the companies should lean into their growth and spend even more to get bigger fast. It could turn out to be a stellar bet. Or fail spectacularly.  Netflix's strategy means two things: The company must keep churning out shows compelling enough to persuade more people to subscribe, and it needs to be able to continue borrowing money at low cost to finance its losses.  So far, Netflix stock and debt investors aren't worried. Netflix bonds due in 2026 have been trading just below 100 cents on the dollar. Netflix shares shot up about 9 percent in after-hours trading after the company released its financial results. Already the company's enterprise value is more than 50 times estimated 2018 earnings excluding interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and employee stock compensation costs. Those are not characteristics indicating signs of worry.  It's hard to find fault with Netflix's execution or its track record. The company is making a rational decision to splurge while it can and borrow money while it's cheap. But no one knows what Netflix looks like in normal funding times. What happens if the debt market isn't as compliant in coming years? The Netflix growth machine suddenly looks less like a sure thing. I'd call it a roller-coaster ride, but at least roller coasters tend to follow a predictable trajectory and wind up exactly where they started. For Netflix, confidence about where the company ends up is all in the eye of the beholder.

Netflix, which released its first original series just six years ago, has now lured two of the most successful producers in TV -- Murphy and Shonda Rhimes -- from two of the industry\u2019s most valuable companies. Rhimes, the producer of \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d and \u201cScandal,\u201d bolted from Walt Disney Co.\u2019s ABC in August.  No longer content to license shows from other media companies, Netflix and fellow technology giant Amazon.com Inc. are throwing money at Hollywood\u2019s top talent to lure them away from those studios. They are upending the TV business in the process, driving up the cost of talent and weakening many of the traditional powers.  Ryan Murphy Photographer: Monica Schipper/Getty Images for Entertainment Weekly  Hollywood studios have endured threats from outsiders before, but the list of talent making the jump grows by the day.  Horror Story  Netflix, with an annual budget of $8 billion, is paying Murphy, the producer of \u201cAmerican Horror Story,\u201d about $300 million over five years to make shows and movies for the streaming service. The money will support overhead for Ryan Murphy Productions along with his fees for writing, directing and producing.  Murphy was in the process of negotiating a new deal at Fox when Disney agreed to buy its crosstown rival for more than $52 billion. Disney Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger made a personal call to Murphy, assuring him that \u201cthe reason Disney was interested in buying Fox is they believed in the assets and the executives and their creators,\u201d the producer recalled. \u201cHe was very sweet and transparent and kind.\u201d  Shondaland  Shonda Rhimes Photographer: Bryan Bedder/Getty Images for Vulture Festival  Rhimes was the biggest name to leave traditional TV for streaming when she announced she was signing a long-term deal with Netflix. She\u2019d worked at ABC for more than a decade, becoming one of the few showrunners and TV writers known to the public.  Rhimes is also one of the few prominent black showrunners in Hollywood, and has led the way in creating more diversity onscreen. Netflix gave her more than $100 million to ease the transition in a multiyear deal.  Zombies  Robert Kirkman Photographer: Tommaso Boddi/Getty Images for AMC  Robert Kirkman, the creator of cable TV\u2019s biggest hit, \u201cThe Walking Dead,\u201d signed a two-year deal with Amazon last August, days before Netflix announced its deal with Rhimes. Amazon spent an estimated $4.5 billion on video programming last year and plans to increase its budget this year. Amazon\u2019s \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u201d won the Golden Globe award for best TV comedy.  Millarworld  Mark Millar Photographer: Karwai Tang/WireImage via Getty Images  Netflix knows its customers love comic book movies and TV shows thanks to a pair of deals with Disney, owner of Marvel Studios. So last year it acquired the company that published graphic novels \u201cWanted\u201d and \u201cKick-Ass,\u201d both of which were adapted into hit movies for Universal Pictures.  Netflix and Millarworld founder Mark Millar will jointly produce films, series and children\u2019s shows based on comic-book characters for the streaming service, while the publisher will also continue to make comics under the Netflix label. The streaming service will turn some of Millar\u2019s other creations into film and TV properties that can replace Marvel when its deal with Disney ends.

But it\u2019s also frustrated competitors in a less-public way: by poaching talent and driving up pay.  The streaming giant has lured scores of defectors by offering big increases in compensation. Recruits are securing as much as double their pay, including stock and other benefits, people familiar with the matter say.  Hiring Spree Netflix's payroll jumped with the company's global expansion and original programs Source: Company reports  With $10 billion for programming and marketing this year -- and a stock that\u2019s vying again to lead the S&P 500-- Los Gatos, California-based Netflix is upending the way people get paid in Hollywood. TV networks and studios are struggling to keep up with a rival who will spend $300 million on a top producer like Ryan Murphy and pay lavishly further down the food chain.  \u201cWith combinations of base, bonus, equity and long-term incentive, new-media companies are figuring out ways to beat traditional studios,\u201d said Neal Lenarsky, founder of STI Management, which represents executives in the media industry.  Old Hollywood is trying to respond. Some studios have pulled back from selling shows to the online service. Walt Disney Co. went so far as to yank its movies from the company and is launching streaming services of its own. 21st Century Fox Inc. sued in 2016, claiming the company induced executives to breach their contracts. Netflix countersued, and the case is inching along.  Few Titles  None of that is stopping Netflix from attracting publicists with as much as $400,000 in salary and other compensation, or about double their prior paychecks, according to the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private compensation data. More senior professionals are seeing similar increases, said one executive who was approached by Netflix.  In making offers, Netflix estimates a candidate\u2019s value based on experience and title, according to employees who asked not to be identified discussing company policy. Then it pays the recruit at the top of what the corresponding range might be. The company also allows candidates to take as much a 50 percent of their compensation in options, they said. A recent change in California law bars employers from asking applicants about their prior salary.  Titles at Netflix don\u2019t necessarily correspond with Hollywood convention. For the most part, the company has just three executive roles -- director, manager and vice president -- and some represent real promotions for people jumping over. Netflix also lets some staffers see what co-workers earn via an internal database, according to the people.  And while many studios reward employees with amenities like a large personal office and titles that seem to confer prestige, almost no one at Netflix has an office. Not even Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings, who co-founded the company.  Netflix employed more than 5,400 people at year-end, fewer people than its competitors in media, and sales are projected to reach $15.8 billion this year. CBS Corp., owner of the CBS and Showtime TV networks, has a payroll of more 12,000 and revenue projected at $14.5 billion this year.  Perhaps nowhere is Netflix more aggressive than in marketing and public relations. The company will spend about $2 billion promoting its service and shows this year. The company lists almost 500 openings on its website, with about a third in Los Angeles and more than 50 in marketing and PR.  Where the Jobs Are Locations of recent job openings listed at the Netflix website Source: Company website  Once wholly dependent on older movies and TV shows licensed from other companies, Netflix will release 700 original programs this year, including 80 movies. A growing share is produced in-house by Netflix Studios, based in the company\u2019s Hollywood offices.  Producing and promoting those shows requires an expanding legion of employees, from colorists to sound engineers to publicists. Netflix is looking to hire dozens of executives for production and post-production jobs, and still more for marketing.  Experienced staffers are in short supply, forcing Netflix to raid rivals who also happen to be programming suppliers. Last year, Netflix hired Bela Bajaria, formerly with Comcast Corp.\u2019s Universal Television, to oversee unscripted TV, as well as Scott Stuber, a producer based at Universal Pictures, to run feature films. Julie Fontaine, executive vice president of movie publicity at Lions Gate Entertainment Corp., jumped to a similar post. The company has recruited dozens of PR people from agencies and studios including Fox and Disney.  Pleasing Investors  Some analysts have questioned Netflix\u2019s outlays, arguing there\u2019s no way the company can turn a profit while spending at its current pace. But CEO Hastings and his team have satisfied investors by delivering record subscriber growth.  \u201cThere are fewer and fewer services a TV studio can provide an artist or producer that Netflix can\u2019t,\u201d said Anthony DiClemente, an analyst with Evercore ISI. \u201cWall Street investors right now don\u2019t care how much they spend on content and infrastructure as long as subscribers are growing and beating estimates.\u201d  Hastings was asked about sky-high talent spending at a recent event at the company\u2019s Hollywood offices.

Operating losses at the company grew to 378 million euros ($461 million) in 2017, up from 235 million euros two years ago. The average user is paying just 5.24 euros a month for a subscription, a drop of more than 20 percent from two years ago. And the only other major online music company to go public, Pandora Media Inc., is struggling.  Yet there\u2019s reason to believe Spotify shares will soar once they begin trading under the ticker symbol SPOT. The music-streaming company has all the hallmarks of another big-spending company with an all-you-can-eat subscription service: Netflix Inc.  Spotify files prospectus for public offering on NYSE. Bloomberg\u2019s Alex Barinka reports. (Source: Bloomberg)  Spotify made no direct comparison to Netflix in a filing Wednesday announcing its plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange, but its pitch to investors rests on a similar thesis to the one driving Netflix shares, which are the best-performing on the S&P 500 this year. Spotify even has the same chief financial officer who took Netflix public -- Barry McCarthy -- and Netflix\u2019s chief content officer Ted Sarandos sits on Spotify\u2019s board.  Read more about the Spotify filing in this Gadfly piece.  The internet has changed the way people consume entertainment, creating an opening for new players to upend sclerotic businesses. Much as Netflix offered customers a cheaper, more convenient alternative to DVDs and pay TV, Spotify has given consumers a reason not to buy CDs from Walmart or songs from iTunes.  \u201cSpotify has transformed the way people access and enjoy music,\u201d the company said in the filing. \u201cToday, millions of people around the world have access to over 35 million tracks through Spotify, whenever and wherever they want.\u201d  Like Netflix, Spotify offers consumers access to a head-spinning selection of content, personalized to their tastes. And like Netflix, Spotify carved out a huge lead, and is now being chased by the biggest players in technology and media.  Big Opportunities?  The world is still in the early stages of the shift to online distribution of movies, TV and music, and the race is on to sign people up all over the world. Netflix, with almost 118 million subscribers worldwide, has allayed concerns about its slowing growth by reminding analysts there are more than 700 million broadband households. Spotify, with 71 million paying users, touts an even larger number in its filing: 1.6 billion payment-enabled smartphone owners expected by 2021.  Being the biggest comes at a cost. Netflix is burning through cash to acquire more programming, telling investors it\u2019s to fund future growth. Spotify delivers more than 70 percent of its sales to music rights holders, despite efforts to improve profit margins.  Sarandos is where the comparisons between Netflix and Spotify get tricky. Netflix, which already forsook DVDs for online streaming, is in the midst of another great evolution. It is building its own studio to produce shows on its own.  Breaking Through  Spotify says it has no interest in signing artists, or paying for artists to record. However, it has another plan to reduce its reliance on its main suppliers: by making them less relevant.  \u201cThe old model favored certain gatekeepers. Artists had to be signed to a label,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Daniel Ek wrote in a letter included in the filing. \u201cThey needed access to a recording studio, and they had to be played on terrestrial radio to achieve success. Today, artists can produce and release their own music. Labels, studios, and radio still matter, but in a cluttered landscape, artists\u2019 biggest challenge is navigating this complexity to get heard. We believe Spotify empowers them to break through.\u201d", "stock": "NFLX", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-01", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-01/spotify-paints-self-as-next-netflix-transforming-entertainment"}, {"article": "The current earnings-report cycle was already off to a strong start when Netflix Inc. set an exceptionally high bar this week, blowing so far beyond subscriber estimates that the video service entered the exalted club of companies valued at more than $100 billion.  Netflix joins the array of U.S., European and Asian companies whose earnings are getting a lift from quickened global economic growth. Meanwhile, U.S. tax cuts should give American companies like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. the chance to reward investors with goodies such as buybacks on top of bonuses they\u2019ve already sprinkled out to workers.  Not every CEO will have as pleasant news to deliver as Netflix\u2019s Reed Hastings. Stung by an October earnings call that went awry, Oscar Munoz on Tuesday afternoon is scheduled to report United Continental Inc.\u2019s second straight annual profit decline. And speculation is mounting that John Flannery will have to cut General Electric Co.\u2019s 2018 profit outlook on Wednesday due to deep problems in the company\u2019s industrial and finance operations.  With more than a tenth of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 companies already reported, profit\u2019s up 14 percent from a year earlier while sales have risen about 8 percent. Here are a few things to watch:  The Tax Man cometh and he\u2019s got good news  The lower corporate tax rate Congress approved late last year has already helped some companies boost profit forecasts for 2018 -- and they\u2019ve entered earnings season willing to share the largess. Macquarie Research estimates most U.S. airlines will see an average 20 percent increase in earnings per share. The benefits will hit first for cash taxpayers like Southwest Airlines Co., which reports Thursday and has already announced bonuses of $1,000 for its workers.  Wal-Mart is getting a roughly $2 billion tax benefit, and analysts expect it to boost share buybacks and potentially cut prices in addition to the worker raises and bonuses it\u2019s already announced. The world\u2019s largest retailer reports Feb. 20.  While Verizon Communications Inc. reported earnings that missed estimates Tuesday, it said it expects a massive windfall from the tax cut to boost 2018 cash flow by $3.5 billion to $4 billion. The largest U.S. wireless carrier hinted it may also reward bonuses, saying in a statement that it will make an announcement later in the day on \u201chow employees will further share in the company\u2019s success.\u201d  Lower tax = more growth = more shovels  The U.S. tax cut contributed to expectations for faster global growth, and that should help companies that sell goods and services worldwide. The International Monetary Fund this week said it expects the world economy to jump 3.9 percent this year and next -- in each case a 0.2 percentage point bump from its projection in October.  With that growth comes more digging, paving and loading, and analysts have raised 2018 forecasts for Caterpillar Inc. even as it wraps its strongest earnings year since 2012 with Thursday\u2019s report. Those roads need more cars, and IHS Markit predicts global auto sales will rise about 1.5 percent in 2018. General Motors Co. has forecast its profit this year will be consistent with a record of as much as $6.50 a share for 2017.  Global Growth Bodes Well for Earnings The fastest global growth in seven years should help lift corporate profits in 2018 Source: IMF economic forecast  Heady times don\u2019t prevent FX headwinds  The strong global economy can only go so far -- corporate earnings are also exposed to the whims of foreign exchange. The euro gained against every major currency in 2017 and strengthened further in January, so expect more profit warnings from European companies like the one last week from Paris-based distiller Remy Cointreau SA. Luxury conglomerate LVMH, which reports Thursday after the Paris stock market closes, and German software maker SAP AG, which reports Jan. 30, are among others that may be hurt by the euro. The question is how big of a hit, and whether it\u2019s already reflected in stock prices.  Euro Beat All Major Currencies Last Year The strengthened euro is likely to hurt European company earnings this season  The flipside? The dollar\u2019s decline against most major currencies should give a boost to U.S. exporters and companies that translate foreign sales back into dollars. PPG Industries Inc. said last week, for example, that the weaker greenback would increase the paint-maker\u2019s 2018 revenue by as much as $300 million. Post-it Notes maker 3M Co., which generates about 60 percent of its sales overseas, reports on Thursday and expects favorable exchange rates to add 10 cents a share to profit this year.  Can profits stay ahead of energy costs?  While surging oil prices will benefit energy companies, they\u2019re also having a wider effect. Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. last week said fourth-quarter earnings got a boost from rising crude prices and growing shipments of other commodities. For chemical makers like DowDuPont Inc., which reports Feb. 1, a big question is whether product prices can rise fast enough to recoup higher costs for oil-derived raw materials.  An iPhone\u2019s ring is heard round the world  And as always, investors will be watching Apple Inc., the world\u2019s most valuable company, when it reports Feb. 1 for signs of how demand is faring for the iPhone X. The results are likely to affect Asian suppliers. South Korea\u2019s LG Display Co. reported Tuesday that operating profit missed the lowest analyst estimate. The news came about a week after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. forecast revenue that fell short of expectations, as waning smartphone sales in China and a strong local currency outweighed booming demand from cryptocurrency miners. Samsung Electronics Co., a supplier and rival to Apple, reported lower-than-projected profit this month as it lost momentum in memory chips.  \u2014 With assistance by Dave McCombs, Nick Turner, Tara Patel, Crayton Harrison, Rebecca Penty, Rick Clough, Julie Johnsson, Jack Kaskey, Mary Schlangenstein, Joe Deaux, Scott Moritz, and Jessica Brice", "stock": "NFLX", "label": 1, "date": "2018-01-23", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-23/netflix-sets-high-bar-for-already-strong-global-earnings-season"}, {"article": "CBS Corp., owner of the most-watched TV network in the U.S., has come up with a solution to investor concerns about the future of the TV business: make more shows like \u201cStar Trek: Discovery.\u201d  The media company has doubled the number of programs it produces in recent years, creating shows for its own TV channels and streaming services, and others for tech giants Netflix, Amazon and Apple.

The company also offers an online news service for free, and will introduce a sports service in the coming weeks.  While media companies like Walt Disney Co. are clawing back their shows and movies from streaming companies for use by their own services, CBS is trying to have it both ways. \u201cStar Trek: Discovery,\u201d the first new series in the science-fiction franchise in more than a decade, streams on CBS\u2019 All Access in the U.S. and on Netflix everywhere else.

As Netflix continues to ramp up its annual content investment, the streamer has effectively changed the paradigm for content producers in a way that both expands and limits opportunities for producers and studios as well as for rival networks competing for the best content and talent, per Digiday.  Netflix CFO David Wells said recently that in 2018, Netflix will spend $8 billion and produce 700 pieces of original content, including 80 full-length original movies and 80 foreign-language original productions from local international territories where Netflix operates.  Thanks to its massive spending, Netflix has created a seller's market for producers and studios. Here are some of the fundamental ways that the new paradigm initiated under Netflix has benefited content producers:  There are more opportunities to sell content because Netflix is such a major buyer. In addition to buying more shows than other platforms and networks, Netflix also buys more episodes.  Netflix pays producers more money upfront than other programmers.  Netflix is mostly hands-off once it agrees to buy a piece of content, and will largely give producers creative free rein over their projects.

Netflix is accessible through Altice One, which is Altice's device that allows users to access streaming services like YouTube and Pandora. Netflix is partnering with an increasing number of cable providers, and is also integrated into Comcast's Xfinity X1 set-top box.  Under the partnership, Altice customers who aren't already subscribed to Netflix can do so directly through Altice One. Altice USA is one of the US' largest broadband communications and video service providers, with 3.4 million residential pay-TV customers as of Q3 2017. For context, Comcast reported 21.3 million residential video customers for FY 2017.  The Netflix-Altice partnership represents Netflix's ambition to grow through bundling with TV and internet providers. In Q2 2017, Netflix partnered with telecom SFR Group, a France-based subsidiary of Altice, to be sold with SFR's internet and TV services, for example. Bundling with TV and internet providers is mutually beneficial \u2014 Netflix can increase its reach in new markets, while its partners are able to upsell existing customers to more expensive packages.  Bundling with cable operators allows Netflix to capitalize on consumers who view linear TV and OTT services as complementary. A September 2017 study found that 49% of consumers who had their pay-TV service for four years or more subscribe to an OTT service, per TiVo. Even with the broader trend of consumers relying less on linear TV in favor of cheaper digital alternatives, Netflix can grow through set-top box partnerships by capturing long-term pay-TV subscribers who use OTT services in addition to pay-TV.

Netflix has poached prolific US TV producer Ryan Murphy from 21st Century Fox in a deal worth up to $300 million, making it one of the biggest TV production deals ever signed, the Financial Times reports.  Murphy will begin creating content exclusively for Netflix in July, and the series he created at 21st Century Fox, including \"American Horror Story\" and \"Feud,\" will remain on the company's networks. The deal will deepen the existing relationship between Netflix and Murphy, who previously signed a deal to executively produce a Netflix series in February 2017.  Fox bid aggressively to retain Murphy, but the producer's decision to move to Netflix makes sense for two key reasons:  Murphy's dodging the uncertainty surrounding the Disney-Fox acquisition. Murphy maintains close relationships with Fox Television Group Chairman Dana Walden and 21st Century Fox President Peter Rice. However, should Disney's landmark acquisition of most of 21st Century Fox's assets close as expected, it's not guaranteed that Walden and Rice will remain in their roles. This uncertainty factored into Murphy's decision to move.  Murphy maintains close relationships with Fox Television Group Chairman Dana Walden and 21st Century Fox President Peter Rice. However, should Disney's landmark acquisition of most of 21st Century Fox's assets close as expected, it's not guaranteed that Walden and Rice will remain in their roles. This uncertainty factored into Murphy's decision to move. He's gaining the creative freedom that comes with producing for a video streaming service. Murphy is known for his graphic and shocking work, and although the producer had virtually full creative freedom at Fox, working at Netflix will likely allow him to further explore his creative boundaries \u2014 creators generally have to worry less about profanity and nudity when creating for Netflix, as it's not a platform driven by ad revenue.  The deal is representative of the intensifying battle between digital video services and traditional media companies for top Hollywood talent. In addition to Fox's bid, Amazon also made a serious bid for the top Hollywood producer, according to The New York Times. Video streaming services like Netflix and Amazon are aggressively pursuing top creators and entertainers as eyeballs shift away from linear TV in favor of digital platforms.  Netflix has been successful in luring top Hollywood talent in the past year. The company poached accomplished producers Shonda Rhimes and Betsy Beers from ABC in August 2017. Additionally, Netflix has been able to sign separate deals with former Late Show host David Letterman, and big-name stand-up comedians Chris Rock, Dave Chappelle, and Amy Schumer. Netflix plans to spend up to $8 billion on original content in 2018, up from $6 billion in 2017, and its budget eclipses those of rivals like Amazon and Hulu, positioning Netflix well to continue to court top Hollywood talent.

Swinburne thinks Netflix is \"still in the early stages of global adoption,\" citing the largely untapped international market as one key area of growth potential.  Morgan Stanley, Netflix  But Netflix shares haven't been without their problems as of late. In late March, they were pressured after President Donald Trump announced plans to crack down down on Chinese investment in US technology. They were also hit hard in the wake of Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal. In all, they've fallen more than 10% from their record high of $334 to their current price of $298.  But Swinburne says fear not, Netflix will be hit a fresh record high in no time. He has a $350 price target and a bull-case-scenario target of $440, both of which are well above the Wall Street consensus of $288.  Netflix has roughly 120 million subscribers, but the total addressable market for video streaming is much larger \u2014 more than 660 million by Swinburne's count. He says that, coupled with Netflix's \"history of successfully scaling in a wide variety of markets,\" makes him optimistic on the company's future.  Of those 660 million+ addressable subscribers, Swinburne believes Netflix will capture more than 300 million by 2028. That would represent one third of global broadband, compared to the roughly 20% Netflix has captured thus far, according to the note.  One reason Swinburne thinks Netflix will take much of that large market is not simply because of its superior brand perception as the leader in movie streaming, but also because of the content it can poach. Swinburne identified Netflix's \"ability to maintain exclusive content offering to differentiate product from competitors, and to a lesser extent, success of original programming,\" as core \"key value drivers.\" Netflix is known for winning bids for top original content producers who can make new content, exclusively for its platform.

India is an attractive market for Netflix for several reasons:  Consumer spending in India is anticipated to more than double by 2025. Rising household income and economic growth are expected to boost consumer spending in the country to $4 trillion by 2025. Growth in consumer spending implies that the pool of consumers who can sign up for a Netflix subscription will increase significantly in the coming years.

However, Netflix's pricing strategy may cause Indian consumers to turn to more affordable streaming services. A Netflix subscription in India costs around $7-12 per month, depending on the package, versus $3 per month for Hotstar and $15 per year for Amazon Prime, which includes access to Prime Video. Hastings said Netflix hopes Indian consumers compare Netflix's price to movie tickets, rather than a typical pay-TV subscription, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Although Indian consumers will gain more disposable income in the coming years, the amount they're willing spend on OTT services will remain limited, which may inhibit Netflix's ability to onboard subscribers in the region.

Netflix hit a record high above $295 a share Monday, giving the company a market cap of about $127 billion.  Shares of the video-streaming company have gained momentum following a solid fourth-quarter earnings report and the announcement of a $300 million deal with \"Glee \"and \"American Horror Story\" producer Ryan Murphy.  The company's negative free cash flow also doesn't seem to be a concern for investors as Netflix's subscriber base and revenue growth continue to impress. Investors are expecting positive cash flow to come soon.  FAANG stocks, of which Netflix is a member, have been outperforming the broader market this year. They have yielded a return of more than 18% in 2018, far better than the S&P 500's 2.8% gain, according to Bespoke Investment Group.  While FAANG members Alphabet and Facebook are down slightly after the stock market's correction, Netflix shares have rallied 6%.  Netflix is the top-performing FAANG stock in 2018, having gained 45.45% year-to-date. Meanwhile, Amazon (+27.96%) is the only other member of the group currently sporting a double-digit percentage gain this year, but Alphabet (+5.39%), Apple (+3.64%) and Facebook (+1.49%) are all trading higher.

Shares of Netflix are set to open at a record high near $251 on Tuesday after the streaming giant posted earnings that once again beat analyst expectations for revenue and subscriber growth.  The company reported earnings of $0.41 per share after the bell Monday on revenue of $3.29 billion, which sent the stock up over 10% in after hours trading.  Netflix has been adding more subscribers internationally than in the US in recent quarters, and this period was no exception. Netflix added a total of 8.33 million subscribers \u2014 2 million more than expected \u2014 with 1.45 million added from the US and 4.9 million internationally. Both measures were better than expected.  \"We had a beautiful Q4, completing a great year as internet TV expands globally,\" the company said in a letter to shareholders. \"In 2017, we grew streaming revenue 36% to over $11 billion, added 24 million new memberships (compared to 19 million in 2016), achieved for the first time a full-year positive international contribution profit, and more than doubled global operating income.\"  The growth has been fueled by mega-hits like \"Stranger Things 2.\" UBS analysts predicted last week that new shows from the fourth quarter, namely \"Ozark\" and \"Mindhunter,\" have generated just as much subscriber excitement as hits like \"House of Cards\" or \"Narcos.\"  Netflix warned that its free cash flow will be between $-3 billion and $-4 billion in 2018 as it invests to take on competitors who are rapidly launching their own competing streaming services, the largest of which being Disney. \"We are striving to make the right choices and investments to grow the value of the firm,\" the compay said \"and that is what also ultimately secures our debt. High yield has rarely seen an equity cushion so thick.\"  The spending should help Netflix stave off any new competition as other companies develop their own streaming products, namely Disney, which is already pulling its content from Netflix and plans to launch its own service in 2019.  \"The market for entertainment time is vast and can support many successful services,\" Netflix said. \"In addition, entertainment services are often complementary given their unique content offerings. We believe this is largely why both we and Hulu have been able to succeed and grow.\"  So far, this strategy appears to be paying off, with smash hit originals like \"Stranger Things\" continuing to draw in new subscribers and offset any pushback from the price hike that went into effect in the fourth-quarter.  Shares of Netflix have gained 65% in the past year.  Here are the key numbers for Netflix's Q4 earnings:  Q4 EPS (GAAP): $0.41 versus Wall Street estimates $0.41.  $0.41 versus Wall Street estimates $0.41.

Though Netflix has very shallow penetration in the Asian market, it's presence will continue to grow thanks largely to the appeal of original content to draw subscribers, Mahaney found.  Mahaney raised his price target to $350 per share.  Watch Netflix's stock move in real time here.  The Asian market has been notoriously difficult for Western companies to break into due to the challenges of local rivals, protectionist regulations, and cultural barriers to surmount. But Netflix could find a way in through Japan.  Japan is one of the largest markets the video-streaming company has entered, and has been considered \"the vanguard of Netflix's entrance into Asia \u2014 a market with not only a large user base but also different cultural dynamics surrounding content streaming,\" according to RBC Analyst Mark Mahaney.  The Japanese market has been hard for streaming companies to crack into because it is usually ahead of the US in terms of technology, meaning there's already a plethora of established \"freemium\" options for consumers to choose from.  However, recent trends show that Netflix is gaining some traction in the country, which could set the stage for a deeper penetration into Asia.  Though only 5% of respondents to an RBC survey said they watched Netflix \u2014 up from 3% in February 2017 \u2014 63% of Japanese subscribers said they were \"Extremely\" or \"Very\" satisfied with Netflix, and a record-high 31% of Japanese subscribers said they were \"Extremely,\" \"Very,\" or \"Moderately\" likely to pay for the streaming service, compared with 24% in the same month a year ago.  \"We believe that these results highlight that Netflix\u2019s entry into Japan is still early, but materially improving,\" Mahaney said.  Mahaney also looked at Google Trends data across the continent and found there were \"consistent upward trends\" in search results for \"Netflix\" in 2017 and into 2018. There have been studies that found a correlation between Google searches of the term \"Netflix\" and Netflix viewership numbers.  \"2017 appears to have been an early pivot year for Netflix in Asia and 2018 is showing good momentum so far,\" Mahaney wrote in a note.  There is also an opportunity to appeal to this large segment of the global population through its slate of new and original content planned for this year, Mahaney says. Around 88% of Japanese respondents indicated that original content influenced their decision to use the service.  \"We believe these [numbers] indicate the broad appeal of Netflix\u2019s Original Content slate, not only across geographies but even across languages barriers,\" Mahaney added.  Mahaney raised his price target to $350 from $300.  Netflix's stock was trading at $323.86 per share, and was up 59.69% for the year.

Netflix announced it will release a series of 15-minute stand-up comedy specials in the coming months, indicating the video streaming service is furthering its push into short-form content, Vulture reports.  The yet-to-be-named comedy series will be released in packages throughout 2018, and will include a mix of newcomer and well-established comics. These specials add to Netflix's growing library of short-form content \u2014 the company added a 15-minute show from Fox Digital Studios in 2017, for example.  The short-form comedies release can help Netflix's aim of acquiring more mobile viewers. Mobile viewers prefer shorter, snackable content \u2014 47% of all mobile video viewing is on videos 20 minutes or shorter, while 39% of views go to content 5 minutes or shorter, according to Ooyala per Variety. Appealing to mobile users can help Netflix measure up to YouTube, which ranked first in terms of average monthly users across iPhone and Android in 2017.  Netflix's expansion into short-form contrasts Facebook's content strategy, which leans toward longer-form videos. Facebook announced it would begin prioritizing longer videos that drive repeat viewership in December 2017, as part of its larger strategy to cultivate more \"lean-back\" viewers for its Watch section. In contrast, Netflix's short-form push can help the company gain more casual mobile viewers, who are consuming short-form video on Facebook and YouTube instead.  Netflix's short-form push comes as the company is adding subscribers at a rapid clip.The company beat analyst expectations and added 8.3 million subscribers globally in Q4 2017, bringing its total subscriber count to 118 million. The company plans on spending up to $8 billion and $2 billion on content and marketing in 2018, respectively, to help sustain subscriber growth.

Rodriguez/Getty  Netflix shares are spiking after the company announced a deal with \"Glee\" and \"American Horror Story\" producer Ryan Murphy.  Netflix's fourth-quarter revenue beat was \"fueled by our original content,\" according to the streaming giant.    Netflix shares are spiking Wednesday after the streaming giant announced a deal with Ryan Murphy, the producer of \"Glee\" and \"American Horror Story,\" reportedly worth up to $300 million over five years.  Netflix's stock is trading up more than 3% to above $266 a share. Netflix shares hit an all-time high of $284 in late January.  Murphy will remain with 21st Century Fox through the end of his current contract this summer, and Disney's pending acquisition of several Fox businesses was reportedly a factor in his decision to leave the traditional television studio for Netflix, according to The New York Times.  This is Netflix's latest move to steal top producers from traditional television in order to create original content as it competes with other streaming giants like Hulu, Apple, and Amazon. Last August, Netflix signed a deal with Shonda Rhimes, the producer behind ABC's hit shows \"Grey's Anatomy\" and \"Scandal.\"  Netflix said it will spend up to $8 billion this year on original content, which comes as no surprise to investors who have grown accustomed to Netflix's propensity to spend big. By comparison, Apple said it will only spend $1 billion on original content.  After Netflix beat Wall Street estimates on revenue for the fourth-quarter, the company said in its earnings report that the strong revenue was \"fueled by our original content.\"  Markets Insider", "stock": "NFLX", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-14", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/netflix-stock-price-jumps-after-deal-with-ryan-murphy-2018-2-1015778302"}]
