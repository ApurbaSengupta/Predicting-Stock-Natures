FILE PHOTO: An Apple logo hangs above the entrance to the Apple store on 5th Avenue in the Manhattan borough of New York City, July 21, 2015. REUTERS/Mike Segar  Apple said it had appointed Oliver Schusser as vice president of Apple Music and international content. Schusser, who joined Apple 14 years ago, will report directly to Apple senior vice president Eddy Cue and will also oversee Apple\u2019s services outside the United States, including the App Store and iTunes.  Apple\u2019s top streaming music rival Spotify Technology SA has 71 million so-called premium subscribers, a figure that includes users who have given the company a credit card number for a free trial. Spotify became a public company earlier this month after holding a so-called direct listing on the New York Stock Exchange.  On a comparable basis, the Apple Music service has 48 million subscribers, 40 million of whom are paying subscribers and 8 million of whom are on a free trial, Apple said. Both firms charge $9.99 a month for streaming music but provide discounts for student and family plans.  Variety magazine earlier reported the new subscriber figures and Schusser\u2019s promotion. He previously built up Apple\u2019s services businesses outside the U.S. in 155 markets, including China, Japan and Latin America, Apple said.  Apple\u2019s services business, which includes Apple Music, the App Store and iCloud, is becoming increasingly important to the Apple\u2019s financial outlook because the smart phone market has matured and iPhone sales growth has slowed. In its most recent quarter, Apple\u2019s services business grew 18 percent to $8.4 billion, missing analyst expectations of $8.6 billion.

The EU decision is the latest in a series by global regulators that have amounted to billions of dollars in fines and require changes in Qualcomm business. The contract at issue with Apple is no longer in force, and Qualcomm already faces more competition from Intel and other rivals.  Still, the EU decision could make Qualcomm more vulnerable to chipmaker Broadcom Ltd\u2019s $103 billion hostile bid, since Broadcom argues it can smooth rocky relations with customers such as Apple..  Qualcomm said it would appeal the decision immediately.  The European Commission said its investigation, launched in 2015, covered the period from 2011 to 2016 and took into account Qualcomm\u2019s market dominance in LTE baseband chipsets, which enable rapid mobile broadband connections.  \u201cQualcomm paid billions of U.S. dollars to a key customer, Apple, so that it would not buy from rivals. These payments were not just reductions in price \u2013 they were made on the condition that Apple would exclusively use Qualcomm\u2019s baseband chipsets in all its iPhones and iPads,\u201d European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.  \u201cThis meant that no rival could effectively challenge Qualcomm in this market, no matter how good their products were,\u201d she said.  The fine represented 4.9 percent of Qualcomm\u2019s 2017 turnover, the Commission said.  Qualcomm General Counsel Don Rosenberg said in a statement that the company believed its agreement with Apple did not violate EU rules. \u201cWe have a strong case for judicial review and we will immediately commence that process,\u201d he said.  Qualcomm\u2019s shares were down 1.35 percent at $67.42 in midday trade, and analysts saw the fine as good for Broadcom\u2019s approach.  \u201cWhile Qualcomm believes they are in a temporary (albeit perfect) storm of customer and regulatory issues, Broadcom believes that the current problems are a harbinger of further headwinds to come,\u201d Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Bernstein, said in a note to clients Wednesday. \u201cAnd this latest finding continues to support the idea that regulators remain unhappy with the current state of affairs.\u201d  Despite levying fines, EU antitrust regulators recently cleared Qualcomm\u2019s $38 billion bid to buy NXP Semiconductors. Chinese regulators still need to approve the deal, and some NXP shareholders want a higher price.  Qualcomm is required to post a bond for the fine while the appeal unfolds, which will likely result in a charge for the current quarter. When hit with fines in the past, such as $774 million levy last year from Taiwanese regulators, Qualcomm took a charge as it appealed.  RELATIONS WITH APPLE STRAINED  Vestager told a news conference there would be no repercussions for Apple in the case.  EU antitrust regulators have come under pressure after European judges sent a case against U.S. chipmaker Intel back to an EU court for an appeal. Intel was fined 1 billion euros in 2009 for paying computer makers to buy most of their chips from them.  Google has also appealed against a record 2.4 billion euro fine for giving prominent placements in searches to its shopping service and demoting rival offerings.  This is the Commission\u2019s first decision on market abuse since the Intel ruling last September. Vestager said the ruling had given guidance on how to prove its case.  \u201cWe have carefully examined the ruling and the evidence in our case to make sure that our decision fully complies with the guidance given by the court,\u201d she said.  Apple and Qualcomm are meanwhile locked in a wide-ranging legal battle over Qualcomm\u2019s business practices, which started a year ago with Apple suing Qualcomm for nearly $1 billion in patent royalty rebates that the chipmaker allegedly withheld from the phone maker.  Other regulators, including the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, are also investigating Qualcomm\u2019s dealings with Apple. The EU competition enforcer is expected to rule in the coming months against Qualcomm in another case involving British phone software maker Icera, which was later acquired by Nvidia Corp, a person familiar with the matter has told Reuters.  In that case, Qualcomm is accused of selling chipsets below cost to drive out Icera - a practice known as predatory pricing.

Apple is looking to reassert dominance in U.S. schools, where inexpensive laptops running software from Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google and Microsoft Corp now top iPad by sales, offering a cheap way to get to cloud-based productivity tools.  The new iPad has a more powerful computing chip and an extensive set of new, free software for teachers to manage students and schoolwork. But the unchanged starting price of $299 for students and $329 for the general public, without a keyboard or case, compares with less than $200 for some Windows and Google Chrome models.  Apple shares were down 1.4 percent to $170.26 after the event, slightly better than the NASDAQ Composite, which was down 1.6 percent in midday trading.  Some analysts had believed Apple might cut prices, but the company stuck with its more traditional approach of packing more features into a device.  Despite the new software, Apple faces a tough battle in the educational market given the popularity of Google and Microsoft\u2019s productivity suites, said Carolina Milanesi of Creative Strategies. Google\u2019s G Suite fueled Chromebook sales because it was seen as easy to use to manage assignments.  \u201cMost teachers don\u2019t look past G Suite for education,\u201d she said.  Apple, as part of its response, on Tuesday announced improvements in its iWork suite at an event in Chicago, where school bells and announcements over a public address system directed press and more than 300 teachers into an auditorium at Lane Tech College Prep High School.  The event came during a spring buying season when many schools are making purchasing decisions for the upcoming school year.  \u201cWe\u2019ve been at this for 40 years and we care deeply about education,\u201d Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said at the event.  Apple executives said the new iPad works with its pencil accessory and features an upgraded A10 Fusion chip, the same CPU that powers the iPhone 7. It is available immediately.  The Apple Pencil remains priced at $99 for the public and $89 for schools, though Lenovo will release a device called Crayon for $49, the first third-party stylus to work with the iPad.  Apple's Vice-President of iOS, iPad and iPhone Product Marketing, Greg Joswiak, speaks at an education-focused event at Lane Technical College Prep High School in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., March 27, 2018. REUTERS/John Gress  Apple made up just 17 percent of the K-12 U.S. educational market in the third quarter, according to data from Futuresource Consulting. Meanwhile 60 percent of mobile computing shipments to schools ran Google\u2019s Chrome and 22 percent had Windows.  Chromebooks sold by Dell Technologies Inc cost as little as $189. Microsoft last year introduced an education-focused laptop from Lenovo Group Ltd running Windows 10 S for a similar price.  Acer Inc announced a tablet that runs Chrome OS for $329 on Monday that comes with a built-in stylus.  Apple in recent years made changes to its operating system so that more than one student can log into an iPad, and to its software to let teachers better manage students.  On Tuesday it updated iWork - which includes word processing, spreadsheet and presentation software - to allow students to take handwritten notes more easily, along with adding more free storage on its iCloud service.  Apple also released a new app called Schoolwork to help teachers create assignments and track student progress. Google has a similar app for managing student profiles, but analysts highlighted Apple\u2019s Schoolwork app as unique in helping teachers manage assignments and progress.  The previously iPad-focused Classroom teacher administration app would start working on Mac computers in June, Apple said.  In the fall Apple will roll out \u201cEveryone Can Create\u201d lessons on video, photography, music, and drawing, joining existing \u201cEveryone Can Code\u201d guides for computer programming skills.  The new courses highlight features that some low-priced laptops do not have, such as a camera and microphone.  \u201cIf you look at it as a Chromebook competitor, it\u2019s expensive. But if you look at it and say, I can do music with GarageBand, I can take pictures or use it as a video camera and now I can do (augmented reality) ... it appeals to teachers and schools that want to push the envelope on education,\u201d Milanesi said.

REUTERS/Regis Duvignau/File Photo  At an annual shareholder meeting at Apple Park in Cupertino on Tuesday, Cook responded to a question on whether the company might double its dividend in the wake of changes to United States tax laws that allowed corporations to bring back overseas cash at lower tax rates than before.  \u201cSpecial dividends, I\u2019m not really a fan of,\u201d Cook responded. \u201cBut in terms of annual increases in the dividend, it is something that this board and management are committed to doing.\u201d  Cook said the company would provide an update on its capital return program during its April earnings call with investors, as it has done for the past several years.  At the meeting, shareholders defeated two shareholder proposals, one asking that rules allowing shareholders to nominate directors to the board be eased, and another asking for a human rights committee at Apple.  The proxy access measure asked Apple to reconsider its rules for shareholders to nominate directors; the rules say that a group of no more than 20 shareholders must hold 3 percent of Apple\u2019s stock in order to nominate a director for one of the eight director positions. The proposal did not pass, with 67.8 percent of shareholders voting against it.  Another proposal urged Apple to create a human rights panel to oversee issues such as workplace conditions and censorship in China and to report results back to the public. The proposal was defeated, with 94.4 percent of shareholders voting against it.  Apple had recommended that shareholders vote against both of the measures.  Shareholders approved four measures put forth by the company, including a required \u201csay on pay\u201d vote to approve pay for executives and a measure on re-electing the current directors.

REUTERS/Charles Platiau  Wall Street\u2019s optimism about last year\u2019s 10th anniversary iPhone had propelled Apple\u2019s stock 24 percent higher over the past 12 months, giving it a market capitalization of $893 billion.  That is $141 billion more than the $752 billion market value of Amazon, the world\u2019s third most valuable publicly listed company, but Amazon has been quickly closing the gap.  (For graphic on Market Capitalization: Apple vs Amazon.com vs Alphabet, click: reut.rs/2Fn9hzA)  Amazon\u2019s stock has surged 83 percent over the past year, bolstered by scorchingly fast revenue growth as more shopping moves online and businesses shift their computing operations to the cloud, where Amazon Web Services leads the market.  In January, Amazon announced that it, Berkshire Hathaway Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co would form a company to cut health care costs for their employees, which was widely seen as a threat to the existing U.S. healthcare system and underscored Amazon\u2019s ability to disrupt markets.  Amazon dislodged Microsoft Corp as the No. 3 U.S. company by market capitalization in February.  At $783 billion, Alphabet Inc has the second largest market capitalization. The Google parent company\u2019s stock has grown about 33 percent over the past year, faster than Apple but far slower than Amazon.  Meanwhile, optimism about Apple\u2019s iPhone X has given way to concerns that demand for the $1,000 device may be weaker than expected.  To be sure, past stock gains are not a reliable predictor of future performance, and the surge in Amazon shares in recent years has been exceptional by most standards.  But if Amazon\u2019s stock were to keep growing on the trajectory seen over the past year, the company\u2019s market capitalization would hit $1 trillion in late August. Apple would reach $1 trillion around a week later if its stock price continued to rise at the same pace seen over the past year.  Alphabet would not reach $1 trillion until 2019 if its stock price continued to rise at the same pace seen over the past year.  (For graphic on race to $1 Trillion Market Cap, click: reut.rs/2DbhQYq)  Most Wall Street analysts are not quite that enthusiastic about the growth of Apple and Amazon. Analysts on average expect Apple\u2019s stock price to rise 11 percent and reach $195 within the next 12 months, which would put its market capitalization at $989 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Analysts covering Amazon on average expect its stock to rise 10 percent within the next year to reach $1,700, which would give it a market value of $823 billion.  Apple on Thursday was up 0.60 percent at $176.05, while Amazon rose 0.31 percent to $1,549.90.

VirnetX\u2019s stock rose as much as 44 percent on the news in after hours trading. The company closed at $4.10 per share on Tuesday.  Apple\u2019s stock has seen little change on the news given that the $502.6 million award is minuscule compared to the company\u2019s profits. The company generated $20 billion profit in the first quarter, the company said in February.  VirnetX claimed that Apple\u2019s FaceTime, VPN on Demand and iMessage features infringe four patents related to secure communications, claims that Apple denied.  The dispute has bounced between the district court, patent office and Federal Circuit since 2010. There have been multiple trials, most recently one involving earlier versions of the Apple devices. A jury in that case awarded $302 million that a judge later increased to $439.7 million.  Kendall Larsen , CEO of VirnetX, said the damages, which were based on sales of more than 400 million Apple devices, were \"fair.\"  \"The evidence was clear,\" Larsen said after the verdict was announced. \"Tell the truth and you don\u2019t have to worry about anything.\"  Apple lawyers declined to comment.  For VirnetX, the jury verdict in its favor could be a short-lived victory. The Patent Trial and Appeal Board has said the patents are invalid, in cases that are currently before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington.  The Federal Circuit, which handles all patent appeals, declined to put this trial on hold, saying it was so far along that a verdict would come before a final validity decision.  VirnetX, based in Zephyr Cove, Nevada, reported just over $1 million in revenue last year but investors have boosted the stock by more than 70 percent in hopes of an eventual victory over Apple.  The company started within government contractor SAIC Inc., tasked with developing secure communications for the Central Intelligence Agency. It was spun out with aspirations to be bought by Microsoft Corp. Instead, Microsoft paid it $200 million to end litigation in 2010, and then another $23 million for newer products.

Investors seeking to gauge demand for the iPhone last quarter got clues Wednesday from Qualcomm Inc. and Broadcom Ltd., two of Apple Inc.\u2019s biggest suppliers.  Both companies indicated that orders related to the iPhone tailed off more than normal at this time of year. That helped round out a flurry of reports in recent weeks that suggested demand for the flagship handset hasn\u2019t met rosy predictions, dragging on Apple\u2019s shares.  Qualcomm said that orders from a large customer tailed off at worse-than-typical levels in the quarter. San Diego-based Qualcomm didn\u2019t identify the company, but the remarks were widely interpreted as referring to Apple. Broadcom said it expects a \u201cgreater-than-seasonal decline in wireless\u201d components, indicating fewer-than-anticipated sales of its chips for its fiscal second quarter, which ends in April. Broadcom provides wireless network and Bluetooth components for the iPhone. Christopher Rolland, an analyst at Susquehanna Investment Group, pegged Apple as the reason for the order slowdown in a note Wednesday.  Apple reports earnings after the close of trading. Analysts have projected revenue of $84 billion to $87 billion for the holiday quarter, including from its new flagship iPhone X, which went on sale in November. However, supply chain reports have indicated that the Cupertino, California-based technology giant has cut iPhone X orders in half for early 2018. Multiple analysts also have said the iPhone X was not the holiday smash hit that some expected.  The company\u2019s stock gained 48 cents to $167.91 as of 1:30 p.m. in New York. Through Wednesday, it had declined 6.6 percent since reaching a record Jan. 18 as talk of an iPhone slump set in. BMO Capital Markets downgraded its rating on the stock Wednesday. Ming-Chi Kuo, at KGI Securities, recently warned that iPhone X sales weren\u2019t as strong as anticipated in China. JPMorgan wrote that \"demand has gone sour quickly,\" and a survey by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners found iPhone X models made up just a fifth of iPhone sales in the holiday quarter.  A smaller supplier, Qorvo Inc., predicted current quarter sales of as little as $645 million, missing analysts\u2019 estimates by more than $100 million. Qorvo makes radio-frequency chips and gets about 40 percent of its sales from Apple, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Apple declined to comment on the suppliers\u2019 forecasts.

The Cupertino, California-based company said revenue in the three months ending in March will be $60 billion to $62 billion. Analysts were looking for $65.9 billion on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  For the final quarter of 2017, Apple said it sold 77.3 million iPhones, down 1 percent from a year earlier and below analysts\u2019 projections of 80.2 million units. The average selling price was $796 -- ahead of expectations -- suggesting its flagship iPhone X handset sold relatively well, while cheaper versions weren\u2019t as popular.  The numbers, which would be extraordinary for virtually any other company in the world, underscore the elevated expectations that investors have for Apple. They also highlight concern about lackluster demand for iPhones, sparked by recent reports of Apple cutting orders to suppliers and lower analyst estimates. Fewer new handsets means Apple has to work harder to sell related services, accessories and other devices. It also leaves less time for the company to create its next big hit, potentially in wearable technology, augmented reality or even transportation.  Apple reported fiscal first-quarter revenue of $88.3 billion, and profit of $3.89 a share, beating average analyst estimates.  Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said the 2017 holiday period was a week shorter, compared with 2016, limiting iPhone sales. \"We are very, very happy with the guidance we are providing,\" he added, noting that sales of handsets were strong in all regions.  \"IPhone X was the most popular phone and since we launched it in early November, for every week it\u2019s been the top selling iPhone,\" Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said in an interview. \"Couldn\u2019t be prouder of it.\"  Apple shares fell about 1 percent in extended trading, after closing at $167.78 in New York on Thursday. The stock had dropped about six percent in the days leading up to earnings.  The iPhone X, which went on sale in November, is available in $999 and $1,149 configurations, at least $150 more than any iPhone starting price that came before. The new iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus handsets also start at $50 more than their predecessors. Those higher sticker prices buoyed ASPs and helped revenue in the holiday period.

The U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating whether Apple violated securities laws concerning its disclosures about a software update that slowed some handsets, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News on Tuesday. The U.S. government has requested information from the company, according to the people, who asked not to be named because the probe is private.  The inquiry is in early stages, they cautioned, and it\u2019s too soon to conclude any enforcement will follow. Investigators are looking into public statements made by Apple on the situation, they added. While the slowdown has frustrated consumers, investigators are concerned the company may have misled investors about the performance of older phones.  \"We have received questions from some government agencies and we are responding to them,\" an Apple spokeswoman said. She reiterated an earlier statement that the company \"never \u2014 and would never \u2014 do anything to intentionally shorten the life of any Apple product, or degrade the user experience to drive customer upgrades.\"  A spokesman for the SEC declined to comment.

Photographer: Michael Nagle/Bloomberg  Several weeks ago, Apple said a software update released in early 2017 slowed down the performance of older iPhones models as a way to avoid the phones shutting down at random. When it released the update, the company hadn\u2019t said the software would slow down the devices. In December, Apple apologized for not clearly communicating this information and vowed to release another update to mitigate the concern.  Earlier in January, Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook told ABC News that when the company put out the software update that caused the performance issues for older iPhones \u201cwe did say what it was, but I don\u2019t think a lot of people were paying attention. And maybe we should have been clearer.\u201d  The slowdowns occur when an older iPhone\u2019s battery reaches a certain, unspecified point of low health and can be fixed if a user replaces the battery. As part of its public apology, Apple cut the prices of battery replacements in its stores to $29, a $50 discount.  Apple plans to release an iPhone software update, called iOS 11.3, in the next few months with new features that let users monitor the health of their batteries and protect against slowdowns. If consumers turn off the throttling, older iPhones will be more prone to randomly rebooting, Apple has said. The system affects iPhone 7 models and older, but not the iPhone 8 and iPhone X, according to the company.  John Thune Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg  After apologizing to customers in December, Apple was sued by consumer advocacy groups and individual iPhone users in a global backlash. Government officials, including U.S. Senator John Thune, a Republican from South Dakota, have also questioned Apple about the slowdowns.  \u201cEven if Apple\u2019s actions were indeed only intended to avoid unexpected shutdowns in older phones, the large volume of consumer criticism leveled against the company in light of its admission suggests that there should have been better transparency with respect to these practices,\u201d Thune wrote in a January letter to Cook.

Apple will be told to file the transaction to the Brussels-based antitrust authority, who will take over the merger review from Austria, where it was originally declared.  Big technology mergers involving startups with insignificant revenue usually fall through the EU\u2019s usual net for checking whether deals harm competition across the bloc. However, alarmed that it nearly missed Facebook Inc.\u2019s takeover of messaging service WhatsApp, the EU is seeking to change its rules to allow it to take charge of acquisitions where a target company makes no money but holds valuable technology or intellectual property.  Apple announced its purchase of the U.K.-based app in December, for a reported $400 million, according to people familiar with the transaction, which would make it one of Apple\u2019s largest acquisitions. The Shazam app uses the microphone on a smartphone or computer to identify almost any song playing nearby, then points users to places they can listen to it, such as Apple Music or Spotify Ltd.  The acquisition would help Apple embed that capability more deeply into its music offerings. The company\u2019s digital assistant Siri was integrated with Shazam in 2014, so users could ask it what song is playing in the background.  The EU may be worried that once Shazam is under Apple\u2019s control, the iPhone maker could choose to make Apple Music the only option for listening to tracks. That could divert some of the referrals from Shazam that currently go to London-based Spotify. The acquisition also gives Apple access to a large user data base of people\u2019s musical interests.  Apple hasn\u2019t indicated that it plans to make Shazam an exclusive for Apple Music, but in the past the company has sometimes made acquired features compatible only with its products. It also has sometimes kept support for properties it\u2019s bought, for example, when Cupertino, California-based Apple acquired Beats Music to develop Apple Music, Apple released an Android version of the program.  Apple said it would work with the EU on the matter, but declined to provide further detail. The EU took up the review after Austria, Iceland, Italy, France, Norway, Spain and Sweden all asked it to do so.  The EU reviewed and approved the Facebook-WhatsApp deal after several European authorities asked the commission to step in. Facebook was later fined for misleading the EU during the merger probe. It had told the regulators it couldn\u2019t combine WhatsApp data with its other services but moved to do so shortly after the deal was finalized.  \u2014 With assistance by Mark Gurman", "stock": "AAPL", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-06", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-06/apple-shazam-deal-may-threaten-competition-in-europe-eu-says"}, {"article": "Apple Inc.

The iPhone maker plans capital expenditures of $30 billion in the U.S. over five years and will create 20,000 new jobs at existing sites and a new campus it intends to open. The Cupertino, California-based company\u2019s shares rose 1.7 percent to a record closing price of $179.10.  \u201cWe are focusing our investments in areas where we can have a direct impact on job creation and job preparedness,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said in a statement Wednesday, which also alluded to unspecified plans by the company to accelerate education programs.  Apple also told employees Wednesday that it\u2019s issuing stock-based bonuses worth $2,500 each following the new U.S. tax law, according to people familiar with the matter.  In its December approval of the most extensive tax-code revisions since 1986, Congress scrapped the previous international tax system for corporations -- an unusual arrangement that allowed companies to defer U.S. income taxes on foreign earnings until they returned the income to the U.S. That \u201cdeferral\u201d provision led companies to stockpile an estimated $3.1 trillion offshore and many were criticized for the moves, including Apple.  By switching to a new system that\u2019s designed to focus on domestic economic activity, congressional tax writers also imposed a two-tiered levy on that accumulated foreign income: Cash will be taxed at 15.5 percent, less liquid assets at 8 percent. Companies can pay over eight years.  New Jobs  Apple is the first major U.S. technology company to act on the new tax law and it joins others, such as Intel Corp., in responding to criticism by President Donald Trump and others that corporations have been ignoring American workers and manufacturing. Job creation was a key pillar of Trump\u2019s election campaign. That means the new positions created by Apple are likely to have a more significant political impact than its $38 billion tax payment, according to Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business.  \u201cThe thrust here is American jobs, jobs on American soil, build manufacturing here, don\u2019t build everything in China,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cYou can\u2019t have an announcement of a million jobs. But you can have companies like Apple saying that we\u2019re going to have 20,000 new jobs here. If other companies say they\u2019re going to have new jobs too, it does add up.\u201d  For more on Apple, check out the Decrypted podcast:  Later Wednesday, Trump tweeted a response lauding Apple\u2019s announcement. \u201cI promised that my policies would allow companies like Apple to bring massive amounts of money back to the United States,\u201d he wrote. \u201cGreat to see Apple follow through as a result of TAX CUTS. Huge win for American workers and the USA!\u201d  Apple has the largest offshore cash reserves of any U.S. company, with about $252 billion at the end of September, the most recently reported fiscal quarter. The tax rate indicates that Apple is likely bringing back a majority of its overseas cash back to the U.S., leaving only a small portion for international investments like retail stores.  \u201cThey\u2019re going to have well over $200 billion by the end of this year that will be available for incremental investments, capital returns and M&A,\u201d said Matthew Kanterman, a New York-based Bloomberg Intelligence analyst. The new tax law lets U.S. companies bring overseas cash reserves back home in one year and pay the resulting tax bill over eight years. \u201cAnd Apple hasn\u2019t historically done big M&A,\u201d he said.  Five-Year Spending Plan  The $30 billion in capital expenditures will come as part of $350 billion that Apple expects to spend in the U.S. over the next five years. The 20,000 new jobs include additional Apple employees at its campuses, data centers, and retail stores, but not third-party developers for iPhone and Mac apps, an economy Apple has touted in the past.  Apple said that part of the $30 billion in capital expenditures will go toward a new U.S.-based campus, new data centers and additional supplier investments. The company, which opened a new headquarters in Cupertino last year, said its new U.S. site initially will be focused on employees who provide technical support to Apple product users. The new location, which Apple said it will announce later this year, will be similar to the company\u2019s existing campus in Austin, Texas, for supply-chain and technical-support employees.  Can This Tax Proposal Lure Companies and Cash Home?: QuickTake  Apple said it will increase its local manufacturing fund, announced last year, from $1 billion to $5 billion, indicating that it will be sourcing more components for its products domestically. As part of the original fund, Apple invested in Corning Inc. and Finisar Corp., companies that make components for iPhone glass screens and lasers for Face ID and AirPods, respectively.  \u201cThese are probably many capital expenditure initiatives and new site build-outs that Apple was already planning on doing regardless of repatriation,\u201d said Michael Olson, an analyst at Piper Jaffray, who has the equivalent of a buy rating on the stock.  \u201cWhat\u2019s not said in this release is that there is more potential for increased buybacks for shareholders and acquisitions that might not have taken place if it were not for the cash influx from overseas,\u201d Olson said.

The headphones, internally known as B288, will include an upgraded Apple-designed wireless chip for managing Bluetooth connections. The first AirPods include a chip known as the W1, and Apple released the W2 with the Apple Watch last year.

A day after, Cook said he \"wouldn\u2019t be in this situation\" if he were in Zuckerberg\u2019s shoes, in an interview with Recode and MSNBC. While Facebook makes money selling targeted advertisements based on user data, Apple\u2019s profit comes from hardware products like the iPhone, iPad, and Mac.

As everything from refrigerators to self-driving cars throw off information that needs to be uploaded to the cloud, data centers will be housing 1.3 zettabytes (1.3 trillion gigabytes) by 2021, more than double from this year, according to Cisco Systems Inc..

How is business?  The demand for ball bearings is very strong and we\u2019re increasingly eating through our inventory. Demand from data centers in particular is very strong. We\u2019re quite surprised by growth of fan motors for cooling data centers. It\u2019s not enough to have one data center, but you need backups. And then a backup for your backup. The data you see on Instagram and other services, that keeps increasing. People aren\u2019t deleting their photos. And we\u2019re very thankful for that.  Are you planning more investment?  We still have capacity to increase by 15 million bearings annually by using space in existing factories in Thailand, which will bring capacity to 300 million by May or June. But it is becoming necessary to invest in new factories. We\u2019re considering possible locations.  How much would you be willing to spend?  We\u2019ve already invested 8 billion yen in expanding capacity, but that was within existing locations. To build infrastructure for a brand-new factory requires a number that has an extra digit. That\u2019s why we have to consider it very seriously.  Will we see profits revised higher again?  I can\u2019t speak about short-term earnings, but when we laid out our medium-term plan last May we expected operating profit to reach 100 billion yen by March 2021. It\u2019s beginning to look like we can arrive at that number a year early.  What\u2019s the outlook for the game-console assembly business?  Our customer is doing very well. We won\u2019t know next fiscal year\u2019s numbers until March. But we\u2019re not a supplier, we\u2019re an assembler. We can deal with bigger demand and won\u2019t need additional investment.

Apple said the base expanded 30 percent from two years ago to 1.3 billion.  That increase should have been seen as positive because Apple aims to become less dependent on selling iPhones and shift to selling its existing customers services like Apple Music or add-on devices like the Apple Watch or AirPods.  But analysts voiced skepticism. Apple's best-selling product, the iPhone, has seen relatively flat unit sales over the same two-year period. On Apple's earnings conference call, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said that the combination of trends implies users are hanging on to their devices longer, and he asked Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook whether investors should be worried about that.  Cook responded that it was up to investors to decide what to focus on, but said he was comfortable with customers buying used iPhones.  When customers sell their old iPhone for a new one, the old iPhone \"winds up with another customer somewhere else that is perfectly fine with having a previously owned iPhone. And so I view all of that to be incredibly positive. It's more people on iPhones, the better,\" Cook said.  Laura Martin of Needham & Co pressed Cook on whether the larger device base meant more devices per user, or more users - an important question, because a user with both an iPad and iPhone is likely to only purchase one Apple Music subscription, for example.  Cook said \"there are many, many, many more\" Apple users than two years ago but declined to give an actual figure.  The signals on how well Apple is monetizing users were mixed. Sales of its \"wearable\" accessories - Beats headphones, AirPods and the Apple Watch - were up 70 percent year-over-year in the fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 30. But services revenue - which includes Apple Music, iCloud and the App Store - fell short of analysts' expectations for the December quarter, at $8.4 billion, and was down slightly from the previous quarter.  Apple has yet to disclose plans for how it will distribute the television shows in which it has been investing in recent months, which could become a large business.  \"They've been building up the services business for several years, knowing full well that at some point the gravy train on smart phones is going to end,\" said Bob O'Donnell, head of Technalysis Research.

Apple runs one of the largest manufacturing chains in the world, but most of the work is done at factories owned by contractors.  Apple audited 756 suppliers in 30 countries, 197 of which it was auditing for the first time.  Apple said in its annual supplier responsibility report that the proportion of \"low performers,\" or suppliers scoring less than 59 points on its 100-point scale, fell to 1 percent in 2017 from 3 percent in 2016 and 14 percent in 2014. \"High performers\" with scores of more than 90 rose to a record high of 59 percent from 47 percent the year before.  Apple found 44 so-called \"core violations\" of its labor rules in 2017, double the previous year. Those included three instances of employees forced to pay excessive fees for a job, a practice Apple banned in 2015.  In one case, over 700 foreign contract workers recruited from the Philippines were charged a total of $1 million to work for a supplier. Apple said it forced the supplier to repay the money.  Compliance with Apple's 60-hour work week fell to 94 percent of suppliers from 98 percent the year before. Moreover, Apple said it uncovered 38 cases of falsification of working hours data in 2017, up from 9 cases the year before.  Apple said the increase was driven by the fact that it brought on a number of new suppliers in 2017 and started tracking the working hours data of 1.3 million supplier employees, 30 percent more than in previous years.  In the report, Apple also said it was launching a new women's' health initiative at its supplier plants, with a goal of reaching 1 million women by 2020. And it said that it had launched a program in China to train workers to become factory line leaders, who often make 20 percent to 30 percent more than line workers.  On Wednesday, Apple also issued its so-called conflict minerals report, which is required by United States securities regulators. The report lists suppliers of sensitive metals such as tin and gold.  Apple company said that 16 smelters and refiners left its supply chain in 2017, 10 of which were dropped because they would not participate in a third-party audit of their practices. Six left of their own accord.  Apple also outlined new rules on student labor after a discovery last year that some Chinese students were working more than 11 hours a day assembling its iPhone X.

An Apple spokesman confirmed that the company does not plan to hold a bidding process for the new campus, after Apple chief executive Tim Cook said on Wednesday that he did not want \"an \"auction kind of process.\"  Apple's new campus is unlikely to be located in California, where the tech company's headquarters are housed at its sleek \"spaceship\" Apple Park campus in Cupertino, or in Texas, where it has facilities in Austin that house customer service and some computer assembly operations, said Cook in an interview with ABC News on Wednesday.  \"We've narrowed the list a lot,\" Cook said of potential sites. \"We wanted to narrow it so we prevent this auction kind of process that we want to stay out of.\"  Apple announced plans for a new site on Wednesday, along with a 5-year, $30 billion U.S. spending plan that will generate 20,000 jobs and an expected payment of $38 billion in taxes on its foreign profits.

Apple shares were down about 1.4 percent at $165.42 in early trade on Friday.  The iPhone X was the first phone to get a major design overhaul since the launch of the iPhone 6 in 2015, and many expected it to lead to blockbuster sales.  On Thursday, the Cupertino-based tech giant said it sold fewer iPhones over the holiday quarter than Wall Street expected, and sees revenue of $60 billion to $62 billion and gross margins of between 38 percent and 38.5 percent for its fiscal second quarter ending in March.  Analysts were expecting $65.7 billion in sales and a gross margin of 38.9 percent for the March quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Analysts at Longbow Research said the revenue guidance implied a low 50 million iPhone shipment forecast against a consensus of 58.5 million.  \"We now forecast 221 million iPhone shipments for fiscal 2018, versus the prior 235 million consensus.\"  On Thursday, Apple also said it was planning, over time, to \"target a capital structure that is approximately net neutral,\" adding that it will \"take that balance down from $163 billion to zero,\" referring to Apple's level of cash net of debt.  The comments sent its shares up about 3 percent Thursday after the bell.  \"iPhone sell-through appears to have declined in the December quarter, which, along with weaker-than-expected  second quarter revenue guidance, reinforces our view of a saturated market,\" KeyBanc analysts said in a note, cutting the rating on the stock to \"sector weight\" from \"overweight.\"\"Further, gross margin results and guidance both missed our expectations, which reduces our view of potential profit growth going forward.\"  Of 39 analysts who cover the stock, 29 rate it 'buy' or higher.

Major technology companies are battling for dominance in U.S. schools, a market seen as important for hooking young consumers.  Apple in March 2017 lowered the price of its 9.7-inch tablet to $329, the lowest starting price ever for one of its full-sized tablets. But laptops running operating systems by Alphabet Inc's Google or Microsoft Corp can be had for less than $200.  Apple's previous price cutting, along with software changes, have been followed by an improvement in iPad sales. Analysts believe the teacher- and student-geared event on Tuesday at Lane Tech College Prep High School will include an update to its iPad lineup, including possibly a lower-priced model.  Apple made up just 17 percent of the K-12 U.S. educational market in the third quarter, according to data from Futuresource Consulting. Meanwhile 60 percent of mobile computing shipments to schools ran Google's Chrome operating system, and 22 percent had Windows.  Chromebooks sold by Dell Technologies Inc can be had for as little as $189. Microsoft last year introduced an education-focused laptop from partner Lenovo Group Ltd running Window 10 S.  Apple in recent years made changes to its operating system so that more than one student can log into an iPad, and to its software to let teachers better manage groups of students.  But it faces a tough battle in the educational market given the popularity of Google and Microsoft's cloud-based productivity suites, said Carolina Milanesi of Creative Strategies. Google's G Suite fueled Chromebook sales because it was seen as easy to use to manage assignments.  \"Most teachers don't look past G Suite for education,\" she said. Apple has iWork, which added features in recent years but remains less familiar to teachers than Google's productivity suite or Microsoft's Office.  Education sales for iPads rose 32 percent to more than 1 million units in Apple's fiscal third quarter. Sales of iPads made up just 8.3 percent of Apple's $229.2 billion total revenue last year, however, compared with the nearly 62 percent of sales generated by iPhones.  Apple needs to keep working to regain market share in schools to get children interested in its devices later on, said TECHnalysis Research founder Bob O'Donnell.  \"It's more about the psychology of driving long-term preference for the (Apple) platform.

In recent weeks, Wall Street analysts have come to a consensus that iPhone X sales were slower than previously expected for the first quarter that ended in December and may drop off sharply for the March quarter.  Analysts have lowered their expectations for Apple's second- quarter revenue guidance to as low as $60 billion from a previous average of $67 billion.  Combined with concerns about the impact of an imbroglio in which Apple acknowledged slowing down phones with worn-out batteries, the weak iPhone X performance has again raised the question of whether the company can keep up its rapid revenue growth without a new hit product.  With eight different iPhone models priced from $350 to $999 on sale over the holidays, Apple showed that it has moved decisively away from co-founder Jobs' tight lineup of premium-priced products and embraced an iPhone-for-everybody strategy.  Analysts are questioning whether Apple can boost its revenue even as iPhone sales essentially plateau.  \"Apple will have to answer the question of what's next,\" UBS analyst Steven Milunovich wrote in a note to investors. \"More services to monetize the base of one billion customers and eventually enhanced [augmented reality] capabilities may be part of the answer.\"  Analysts still expect Apple to post record revenue, hitting the top of its $87 billion guidance for the holiday quarter. But they have slashed revenue estimates for the March quarter and expect the company to sell fewer iPhones in fiscal 2018 than initially thought.  Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi predicted as few as 220 million iPhones will sell in fiscal 2018, just above the 216.7 million sold in 2017 and well below the 2015 peak of 231.2 million.  BTIG analyst Walter Piecyk spotlighted a steadily lengthening replacement cycle as new iPhones offer only small improvements over prior models. Now that it has become clear that a new battery can give life to an old phone, more customers may choose to delay an upgrade, especially with Apple cutting the price of a battery replacement to $29 from $79.  Analysts still believe Apple will report sales of $272.2 billion for its fiscal 2018, 18.7 percent above its $229.2 billion in fiscal 2017. That will be driven largely by higher average prices paid for iPhones, they said.  'WILD CARD'  But Apple does not give data on specific models, and with the wider lineup, analysts must do more guesswork based on surveys and other tools. They also find it harder to predict how much money Apple makes off each phone.  \"We believe that gross margins are a key wild card for investors, given limited transparency into relative margins across iPhone [models],\" Sacconaghi said in a note to investors.  All in all, it's a far cry from the days of Jobs, who shrank the company's product lineup when he returned to the helm in 1997 and kept it limited to a few models of each product at one time until his death in 2011.  But the Apple of today has something Jobs never had: An imposing user base into which it can sell a host of other products and services.  Trip Miller, managing partner at Gullane Capital and an Apple investor, believes Apple's services segment is the firm's next hit product. Analyst expect it to hit sales of $34.7 billion this year, up 16 percent.

Beck Diefenbach/Reuters  Apple acquired music recognition app Shazam in December for a reported $400 million.  It was clear Apple would integrate Shazam into its streaming service Apple Music \u2014 but neither company has given more detail.  Shazam's earliest big investor thinks Apple could get up to 7.5 million new Apple Music subscribers as a result of the deal \u2014 a nice bump to its existing 30 million subscribers.  Analyst Mark Mulligan said the acquisition is probably a combination of subscribers, plus the valuable data Shazam can give on what streaming services people use and what songs they really like.  To understand what Apple might do with its latest acquisition Shazam, you have to understand its evolving business model, according to early investor DN Capital.  The venture capital firm's chief executive, Nenad Marovac, first invested in Shazam in 2004, when its music recognition tech involved users dialling a number, holding up their phones to a source of music, then receiving an SMS \"tag\" which identified a song. Now, the song recognition is done through an app.  \"The way Shazam started off its business model was that after five [SMS] 'tags' you had to pay for it,\" said Marovac. \"Then it moved into lead-generation for MP3s, then it became an affiliate for streaming companies.\"  In other words, if you identified a song, then clicked a link inside Shazam to buy the song through iTunes, a cut of your payment would go to Shazam. But that became less profitable when streaming took off.  Apple once dominated music consumption, when people bought individual MP3 tracks through iTunes. Since the advent of Spotify, it hasn't kept up. Shazam might be a way to drive growth once again.  \"Since Apple has launched Apple Music, it's still a way behind the curve, behind Spotify,\" said Marovac. \"Shazam has 150 million active users a month, and about 300 million to 400 million uniques per year. If you convert 1% to 5% of those users to Apple Music, the investment will pay for itself in spades.\"  BI Graphics  Apple Music had 30 million paying subscribers, according to statistics released in September. Adding 5% of Shazam's base would add a maximum of 7.5 million paying users \u2014 a nice bump, but also best case scenario.  For long-time music industry watcher and Midia analyst Mark Mulligan, the deal is more than just generating paying users for Apple Music.  Apple really needs data to persuade people to use Apple Music more  Customer acquisition is one reason why Apple might have acquired Shazam, Mulligan told Business Insider. It's also likely Shazam will give Apple Music much needed new features that will keep users sticking around for longer, like Spotify's massively successful playlists.  \"Ultimately Apple will have relatively small concerns about how it will be able to acquire customers for Apple Music in the longer term,\" Mulligan said.  \"In relative terms, it's behind Spotify in terms of playlists and weekly active use,\" he added. \"Those are the metrics it needs to do more to drive. The Shazam dataset will be an important asset.\"  When you open the Shazam app and identify a song, you can then stream that song via Apple Music or rivals like Amazon Music and Spotify. That's valuable insight into how people are using other services.  \"It's a window into billions of data points about Shazam's Spotify, Amazon, and Deezer users, there's some value in that,\" said Mulligan. \"It really comes down \u2014 how short was the iTunes dataset coming up? If iTunes' data on a decade of user preferences wasn't good enough, then maybe Shazam was necessary.\"  Mulligan likened the Shazam acquisition to Spotify's purchase of Echo Nest, which now informs its massively successful playlists. It's the poor man's version though. \"To be frank, if I could choose between Shazam and Echo Nest, I'd pick Echo Nest any day,\" he said.  With so competition in music streaming, Shazam is also a signal that Apple is \"serious\" about music. \"Look at Yahoo,\" said Mulligan. \"That should have died off a decade ago, but they kept going by making big acquisitions that made people think Yahoo was serious. It used its increased market cap to then make another overpriced acquisition. There's a proven business model in making overpriced acquisitions to companies vaguely relevant to the space.\"", "stock": "AAPL", "label": -1, "date": "2018-01-25", "source": "business-insider", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-bought-shazam-for-new-subscribers-and-to-rival-spotifys-playlisting-tech-2018-1"}, {"article": "They include Ron Paprocki of Gotham Bar and Grill, a New York restaurant that since the 1980s has taken a structural approach to dishes, like its signature soaring chocolate cake; Rachel Gibeley of Rosebud American Kitchen & Bar in Boston, who oversees a celebrated pie program with creative flavors like grapefruit-caramel meringue; and Brandi Henderson, formerly of Delancey in Seattle, who now runs the adjacent cooking school and community kitchen, the Pantry.  Photo  The best known, though, is Dinara Kasko, a Ukrainian architect-turned-pastry chef who became an internet sensation last year for her sculptural, highly geometric desserts: a cherry cake made to look like shiny red bubbles encased in a cube, and a berry-almond tart with a mazelike surface, constructed with a mold made by a 3D printer.  The link between architecture and pastry dates back at least to 1815, when the renowned French chef Marie-Antoine Car\u00eame wrote \u201cLe Patissier Royal,\u201d a treatise that codified how architectural principles like drawing and planning could be applied in pastry. Chefs have long played with the structural possibilities of sugar, egg whites, flour and other ingredients.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  But today, architectural values and technology are shaping the new norms for dessert. And while the results are carefully plotted and constructed, they are not always towering or eye-popping. In fact, this new school of pastry chefs is trying to rescue the dessert course from the outlandish unicorn cakes and mile-high ice cream sundaes that saturate Instagram.  Photo  \u201cYou have all these photos of desserts covered in rainbows and sparkles, and they might taste like sawdust, but no one knows, because it looks great on social media,\u201d lamented Jansen Chan, a former architect who is now the director of pastry at the International Culinary Center in New York and the Bay Area. \u201cInstagram is a great way for pastry chefs to communicate, but there\u2019s also the danger of people walking away from great pastry just because it\u2019s not totally visually driven.\u201d  Why have he and other chefs made such a radical career shift? In interviews, several said they realized while working in architecture that pastry required a similar skill set, and they found baking a cake a lot more interesting \u2014 and immediately gratifying \u2014 than designing a building.  Ms. Yee, 39, always wanted to be a pastry chef, but went to architecture school to placate her parents, who wanted her to have what she calls \u201ca real job.\u201d She landed a position at the San Francisco design firm Georgina Rice & Co., where she assisted in designing interiors, mostly for high-end apartments.  Photo  Tired of having to abide by mundane building codes and regulations, and wanting something more creative, she began studying pastry in 2002 at Le Cordon Bleu in London, while working as a pastry assistant at the Connaught hotel for the chefs Gordon Ramsay and Angela Hartnett.  She found that her architectural training applied in the pastry kitchen as well. \u201cBeing an architect is not all about the structure,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the intent. How will this improve someone\u2019s life?\u201d  \u201cDesserts are also about thoughtfulness,\u201d she added. \u201cWhat are the ways I can manipulate this apple? What will highlight what\u2019s grown here? It\u2019s about looking at your environment and seeing what will be functional and beautiful in that space.\u201d  Photo  Consider the \u00e9clair, Ms. Yee\u2019s signature dessert when she was the pastry chef at the French restaurant Lafayette in New York from 2013 to 2016.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  \u00c9clairs are highly technical, she said, vulnerable to everything from the level of protein in the flour to the type of oven you are using. The pastry can easily come out overly dry, or completely lose its oblong shape when baked.  But precision, for her, is only one priority. \u201cI wanted some element of spontaneity and approachability,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I garnished them, I would make the glaze a little wonky on the side, or cut the fruit on top in a random way.\u201d  Photo  That attentiveness runs through the sweet creations of Lisa Lu, 49, who oversaw the pastry department at the landmark San Francisco restaurant Boulevard from 2012 to 2017, and is now a production manager at the chocolate company Recchiuti Confections. Two decades ago, as an interior architect, she worked on creative projects like the American Licorice Company corporate headquarters in Bend, Ore., and a mock-up for a shop for the sports apparel brand UltraNectar, in the Bay Area.  \u201cHaving studied architecture,\u201d she said, \u201cI can put together a plated dessert because I understand composition \u2014 the need for balance and a focal point.\u201d  The lime tart she used to serve at Boulevard, like Ms. Yee\u2019s apple strudel, looks nothing like what a diner might expect. Ms. Lu balances a marrow-bone-shaped pastry shell filled with a tangy lime curd and pomegranate seeds on a plate, piping toasted meringue all around the tart, \u201cso that if a server wasn\u2019t careful when transporting the dessert, it would still be intact by the time it got to the table.\u201d The meringue acts like mortar, sealing the tart into place and giving the dessert stability.  Photo  \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect example of balance,\u201d Ms. Lu said. \u201cThe shell, which is designed to be open enough to be able to pipe in a curd, is the focal point. The meringue is piped in a few key areas, and then the scattered pomegranate seeds draw your eye around the plate and connect the whole dessert together.\u201d  To pastry chefs who learned the craft the old-fashioned way and don\u2019t work in the world of high-end restaurants, that kind of talk can sound like an overly cerebral or pretentious way to describe something simple: the joy of creating something sweet.  Stella Parks, a senior editor at Serious Eats and the author of the classic American dessert cookbook \u201cBraveTart,\u201d sees some good in the architectural influence on pastry, noting that it has brought more rigor into the practice.  Photo  \u201cMy worry,\u201d she added, \u201cis always that the culinary element is being forgotten. I have had so many meals at high-end restaurants that were extremely memorable, but more like a trip to a modern art museum, where you would never want those kinds of things in your own home.\u201d  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Agatha Kulaga, a self-taught baker and a founder of the New York City bakery Ovenly, agreed; architectural ideals, she said, often leave out a vital element: nostalgia.  \u201cThe usefulness of an architecture background really depends on the end goal,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can have a dessert made by a pastry chef that feels like looking at a work of art \u2014 or you can have a dessert like a cookie or a slice of cake that doesn\u2019t necessarily feel like art, but creates an experience of joy.\u201d  Photo  But Baruch Ellsworth, the pastry chef at Canlis, in Seattle, who studied architecture at a California community college, said elements like taste and emotion are essential components of the architectural pastry practice. The difference is that they are incorporated more methodically.  Both pastry and architecture, he said, are an equation: \u201cA and B always have to equal C. You can tweak A and B lots of times, but it has to add up. You can\u2019t wing it.\u201d In other words, you can be as creative as you want in your choice of flavors of ingredients, but in the end, the dessert has to be something that people will want to eat, \u201cjust like when you make a building: you can do anything as long as it won\u2019t fall down.\u201d  One of his most popular desserts explores the kaleidoscopic, shape-shifting nature of chocolate. On a single plate, there\u2019s a tobacco-infused chocolate mousse, a Madagascar chocolate brownie, a milk chocolate crisp, a cocoa nib brittle, a caramel cream with caramelized white chocolate, and white chocolate streusel \u2014 all covered in a dehydrated layer of chocolate that elegantly drapes over each component like a silk sheet.  Photo  Mr. Ellsworth compared desserts like that to the Guggenheim Museum in New York. \u201cAt first, you\u2019re like, \u2018I can\u2019t believe this is a building,\u2019 because the outside looks like a tornado,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when you go inside, you realize it is quite functional.\u201d  At the International Culinary Center in California and New York, known for turning out acclaimed pastry chefs like Christina Tosi, of Milk Bar, and Melissa Weller, the founder of Sadelle\u2019s bakery in SoHo, architecture plays a significant role in the curriculum, thanks to Mr. Chan, 42, and his architectural background.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Since 2015, the second half of the school\u2019s six-month pastry program has incorporated lessons on sketching, making timelines and project planning. Mr. Chan added a chapter called \u201cElements of Design\u201d to the school\u2019s textbook; it teaches students about architectural principles like dynamism and scale in relation to dessert.  Photo  Mr. Chan said a number of students have recently come to the school from the architecture world. \u201cThey have a much easier time at adapting because they are used to being asked questions. They are better able to express their creative ideas,\u201d he said. \u201cPastry students with no design backgrounds will be the ones to draw a tall chocolate structure with nothing holding it up.\u201d  Mr. Chan has also introduced technology into pastry education \u2014 tools like lasers, which can be used to bake and pipe batter at the same time, and water-jet cutters, used by architects to slice through sheet metal and by large-scale patisseries and hotels for cutting cakes into precise, programmed shapes in the half the time it would take a person to complete.  Not everyone endorses this approach, though. \u201cArchitecture and pastry are both very human schools of thought,\u201d said Ms. Yee, who makes the un-strudel-like strudel. \u201cYou are always thinking about what people will like. This kind of technology, to me, dehumanizes food. You\u2019re taking away the personal aspect of cooking.\u201d  Some blame technology for the glorification of social-media oddities like clear pumpkin pie, or ice cream wrapped in a cloud of cotton candy.  Mr. Chan recalled encountering a red velvet cake at a bakery in Thailand on a recent trip.  \u201cIt resembled a red velvet cake,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it didn\u2019t have any cocoa. Someone had seen it online but didn\u2019t take the time to look up what, actually, is in a red velvet cake. That\u2019s the problem with social media. You lose context.

When news broke Monday that Mr. Giannandrea was unexpectedly stepping down as Google\u2019s A.I. chief, he immediately became perhaps the most eligible tech executive on the market. By Tuesday, it became clear he was never really on the market.  Apple has made other high-profile hires in the field, including the Carnegie Mellon professor Russ Salakhutdinov. Mr. Salakhutdinov studied at the University of Toronto under Geoffrey Hinton, who helps oversee the Google Brain lab.  Apple has taken a strong stance on protecting the privacy of people who use its devices and online services, which could put it at a disadvantage when building services using neural networks.  Researchers train these systems by pooling enormous amounts of digital data, sometimes from customer services. Apple, however, has said it is developing methods that would allow it to train these algorithms without compromising privacy.  On the debate over whether humanity should be worried about the rapidly accelerating improvements in A.I., Mr. Giannandrea told MIT Technology Review in an interview last year that the concerns were overblown.  \u201cWhat I object to is this assumption that we will leap to some kind of superintelligent system that will then make humans obsolete,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand why people are concerned about it but I think it\u2019s gotten way too much airtime.

Baird & Company, wrote in a research report.  While Amazon\u2019s online store sales grew 20 percent from a year earlier, the company\u2019s total retail growth benefited from its acquisition of Whole Foods Markets. That deal, announced in June, added much of the $4.52 billion in physical store revenue for the quarter.  Yet the biggest revenue growth came from a category generically named \u201cother,\u201d which includes advertising services and rose 62 percent to $1.74 billion from a year earlier.  By far the most profitable big business for the company was Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing unit. Its revenue rose 45 percent to $5.11 billion, and its operating income increased 46 percent to $1.35 billion.  Amazon kept with its tradition of secrecy by refusing to reveal exactly how many of its Echo family of devices it sold, saying only that it sold \u201ctens of millions\u201d of them last year. The company priced the devices aggressively over the holidays \u2014 its cheapest was only $29. The devices probably did not yield much profit, though they are an important part of Amazon\u2019s effort to establish a technology ecosystem that could result in other benefits, such as enabling customers to make impulse purchases with their voices.

For the company\u2019s fiscal first quarter, it reported a record for quarterly net income \u2014 $20.07 billion, up 12 percent from a year earlier. Revenue rose 13 percent to $88.3 billion. The gains were notable considering that Apple\u2019s fiscal first quarter was a week shorter than the previous year\u2019s 14-week fiscal first quarter.  While Amazon is content to price its devices near its costs for making them, Apple is known for charging a premium for its smartphones, tablets and computers. The iPhone X, which uses facial recognition to unlock the device, is the most expensive in its history, starting at almost $1,000.

Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said on the company\u2019s earnings call.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Mr. Cook noted that the iPhone X was the company\u2019s top-selling phone in the quarter despite its November release, roughly a month and a half after Apple\u2019s other new iPhones.  The company sold 77.3 million iPhones over the quarter, which was down 1 percent from the longer quarter a year earlier. Yet revenue was higher largely because of the pricing of the new iPhones: In addition to introducing the iPhone X, Apple raised the price of the base model of its iPhone to $699, up from the $649 starting price for past iPhones.  Sales in its \u201cother products\u201d category, which includes the Apple Watch, grew 36 percent to $5.5 billion. Apple declined to disclose sales of the Apple Watch for competitive reasons, but Mr. Cook noted on the earnings call that revenue for the Apple Watch had grown 50 percent.  Apple also highlighted money generated from services, which include the App Store and Apple Music, with revenue rising 18 percent to $8.5 billion. Apple said the App Store continued to be the top destination for smartphone customers to buy apps.  Apple sold 13.2 million iPads, up 1 percent \u2014 notable because iPad sales declined for many consecutive quarters over the last few years. But Mac sales shrank about 5 percent to 5.1 million units.  Despite strong sales of the pricey iPhone X, some analysts remained concerned that its sales were slowing. Ahead of the earnings call, some news reports said Apple was slashing production of the iPhone X for the quarter that ends in March. The reports cited supply chain partners that said Apple had cut orders for parts.  But in years past, Apple has warned investors that activities of its complex supply chain were an unreliable metric for overall sales. The company also typically slows down iPhone production after the holiday quarter, which is the peak shopping season.  Last month, Apple also unveiled plans to bring the vast majority of its $252 billion in cash held abroad back to the United States, paying a one-time repatriation tax of $38 billion. Because the company had already earmarked $36.4 billion in anticipation that it would eventually have to pay taxes on its foreign earnings, Apple did not see much impact from the recent tax code changes.

Photo  A reality check on the White House\u2019s tariff tactics  Investors last week looked at President Trump\u2019s tariffs against Chinese products and seemed to conclude that he was taking the U.S. into a trade war with China. The stock market plunged 6 percent.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Perhaps eager to stop the rout, the White House on Monday had a less confrontational message: Mr. Trump is applying one of his negotiating tactics. According to this view, the tariff proposal was a jarring move partly aimed at getting China to see that the U.S. was serious about wanting to make trade with China fairer.  From a CNBC interview with Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers:  \u201cFrom the beginning, all the way back to last summer when I arrived at the White House, the president has been clear that he wants to set a marker down with some big asks at the beginning, he doesn\u2019t want to dribble them out, and then he wants his negotiators to try to fix the trade problems. ...Hopefully, it all works out with negotiation.\u201d  Mr. Hassett\u2019s comments were in response to a WSJ article reporting that China and the U.S. were quietly engaged in trade negotiations.  Investors seemed somewhat relieved: The stock market was up 1.5 percent on Monday. Of course, if the stakes are small enough, a deal may get done in the coming months that allows both sides to claim victory. But it seems unlikely that China would quickly agree to a far-reaching overhaul of the rules that govern foreign investment in the country, a major area of dispute. Our colleagues Raymond Zhong and Paul Mozur showed the depth of the divide there.  Mr. Trump could up the ante if China shows no real signs that it will open up considerably. That could roil the markets again. The White House may want to signal that it can take market turmoil in stride. Mr. Hassett on Monday seemed to say that the White House expects market sell-offs as it pursues its trade agenda.  \u201cIf you start from a world where a bunch your intellectual technology is being stolen, then of course it\u2019s going to increase risk premiums in the short run when you try to do something about it, but in the end it should be a positive for us if we can get them to just stop them disregarding the rules of international order.\u201d  (Rising risk premiums means investors require a better return on their stocks and bonds to cover higher risks. This usually involves a decline in price to make their returns look better to prospective buyers.)  Still, the more conciliatory tone from the White House after the sell-off suggests there is not a strong desire for a full-on trade war.  \u2014 Peter Eavis  Shares of Facebook continue to slide.  The stock is down 6.5 percent Monday morning as the Federal Trade Commission confirmed that it has opened an investigation into Facebook\u2019s privacy practice.

Facebook\u2019s shares are down nearly 22 percent since its high in early February and off more than 18 percent since the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke more than a week ago.  To put Facebook\u2019s recent tumble in perspective: The stock is set for its worst monthly performance since August 2012. Over the past 10 days, Facebook has lost $100 billion in market value.  Despite the fall, Wall Street has not soured on Facebook. Forty-four analysts have buy ratings on the stock, compare to just two who have sell ratings, according to Bloomberg.  Photo  Tim Cook thinks regulation of Facebook is inevitable  The Apple C.E.O. said at the China Development Forum in Beijing that the government should tighten privacy regulations, after last week\u2019s revelations about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica:  \u201cI think that this certain situation is so dire and has become so large that probably some well-crafted regulation is necessary. The ability of anyone to know what you\u2019ve been browsing about for years, who your contacts are, who their contacts are, things you like and dislike and every intimate detail of your life \u2014 from my own point of view, it shouldn\u2019t exist.\u201d  Apple often uses privacy as a selling point, but Mr. Cook wasn\u2019t the only critic. Elon Musk deleted SpaceX and Tesla\u2019s Facebook pages, saying that the Tesla one \u201clooks lame anyway.\u201d Sir Martin Sorrell of the ad giant WPP said Facebook needed to \u201cstep up to the mark\u201d and be responsible for content on its platform. And some companies have stopped buying ads on Facebook, highlighting how advertisers want more transparency about performance. (Users also complained that the Android app tracked calls and text messages.)  Meanwhile, Facebook took out full-page ads in several British and American newspapers \u2014 including the NYT \u2014 for an apology signed by Mark Zuckerberg.  Elsewhere in Cambridge Analytica news: A volunteer for the campaign for Britain to leave the E.U. said that a Canadian data company linked to Cambridge Analytica had played a role in the organization\u2019s work. Groups campaigning against Brexit have written to Prime Minister Theresa May demanding an investigation into what members of her cabinet and her staff knew.  Andrew\u2019s take  Mr. Cook\u2019s points on privacy are absolutely right. But he has a tough needle to thread, given that Apple does business in China and acknowledges that it is \u201csubject to each country\u2019s laws\u201d that it does business in. Apple encrypts all user data and says there is no back door \u2014 and I believe that \u2014 most security and political experts have speculated that Beijing might ultimately be able to gain access iCloud data for Chinese customers: It adopted a law requiring all cloud services to be operated by Chinese companies. Apple says that it lobbied against the new law, but ultimately complied.

Gebr Knauf disclosed in a filing on Monday that it had offered to buy USG for $42 a share, or about $6 billion. That marked a 25 percent premium to USG closing price on Friday.  In rejecting the offer, USG said the proposal substantially undervalued the building products maker.  Knauf owns 10.5 percent of USG, making Knauf the second-largest shareholder in USG behind Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway with a 31 percent stake.  Berkshire had proposed an option for Knauf to buy Berkshire\u2019s stake in USG, according to the filing. The option would be exercisable only if Knauf bought all of USG\u2019s shares outstanding for at least $42. Berkshire proposed an option purchase price of $2 per share.  From Reuters:  The option provides a sweetener for Buffett to shed a profitable investment that originated in late 2008, at the height of the housing crisis, when Berkshire and Canada\u2019s Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd bought $400 million of USG\u2019s debt. The $2 per share cost of the option would provide Berkshire about $86.8 million upfront, based on its 43.39 million share USG stake. Berkshire would keep that money even if Knauf proved unable to buy USG.  Shares of USG are up 19 percent Monday.

The trouble with writing the unvarnished truth in a memoir is that it requires you to be hard not only on others, but also on yourself.  Matt Young\u2019s inventive, unsparing, irreverent and consistently entertaining \u201cEat the Apple\u201d is that, but it is also a useful corrective to the current idealization of the American soldier \u2014 or in this case a Marine. Patriotism and respect for the military is so high in this country that we have lately held a national debate over whether professional athletes should be required to stand for the national anthem. Men and women in uniform are given preference in boarding airplanes, and are so routinely thanked for their service that the expression has become rote. Each new season brings a crop of movies and glossy TV serials dramatizing the heroics of our Special Operations.  Young sees hollowness and potential harm in this.  \u201cEnforcing the idea that every service member is a hero is dangerous,\u201d he writes. \u201cLike creating a generation of veterans who believe everything they did was good.\u201d Young warns of \u201ccreating an army of fanatics.\u201d  Service deserves respect, of course, but it does not in itself guarantee stirring and selfless acts of bravery. Young is his own case in point. He sees his experience \u2014 three tours in Iraq \u2014 as far from heroic. He is at least as disturbed by his duty as he is proud of it. These contradictory feelings are a central theme in his book. Years removed, he both loathes and pines for the man he became in the Marine Corps.

The chip maker only just wiggled out from under a takeover offer from rival Broadcom. What Qualcomm really needs is less a buyer and more a mediator.  There are usually two reasons to take a company private \u2014 the idea that the new owner can run it better, or a belief that the market is valuing it wrongly. Broadcom took the first path, and pointed at Qualcomm\u2019s paltry revenue growth and relatively low operating margins. Mr. Jacobs, whose father co-founded the company, is not the man to tackle those problems \u2014 if he were, he would have done it when he was executive chairman.  Valuation is a more compelling argument. It hinges on Qualcomm\u2019s rift with Apple. The iPhone maker is supposed to pay Qualcomm royalties on every phone sold, but has instructed its suppliers to hold back payment while it haggles with the chip maker on how those should be calculated.  A simple calculation shows how important this is: At $10 per phone on 250 million devices per year, Qualcomm would make $2.5 billion in revenue a year, almost all of which would flow to the bottom line. That\u2019s equivalent to a lump-sum value of perhaps $17 billion, assuming a tax rate of 21 percent and margins of 85 percent. If investors aren\u2019t pricing in any Apple royalty at all right now, that\u2019s enough to justify a price close to the $117 billion Broadcom offered.  Mr. Jacobs, however, is not the right person to mend the rift with Apple. One person who could, in theory, is SoftBank\u2019s Masayoshi Son. The Japanese investor has a longstanding relationship with Apple \u2014 and counts both Apple and Qualcomm as investors in his Vision Fund, which is also one of the financial companies Mr. Jacobs reportedly has been asking to finance a bid. Conceivably, he could help them split the difference.  Would SoftBank\u2019s founder be up for the gig? Qualcomm, as a leader in 5G, is a trophy asset, and having Mr. Jacobs on board might neutralize some of the fear of foreign ownership that destroyed Broadcom\u2019s bid. But Qualcomm is also politically sensitive, a supplier to SoftBank already \u2014 and very big. Even with help, Qualcomm is probably too big a bite for SoftBank to chew. Mr. Jacobs, and Mr. Son for that matter, can use their daring to better effect elsewhere.", "stock": "AAPL", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-16", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/16/business/dealbook/qualcomm-apple-mediator.html"}, {"article": "Apple may be dealing with the fallout for a while. The company published a lengthy memo in December saying that smartphone batteries became less effective over time and that its software was intended to prevent iPhones with older batteries from unexpected shutdowns. Apple also apologized to customers for the slowdowns, offered discounts for its battery-replacement program and said it would introduce software to gain visibility into the health of an iPhone battery.  Yet since then, consumer advocacy groups have filed lawsuits against the company for failing to disclose that the software would throttle old iPhones. The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission have also started an inquiry into the matter, according to a person with knowledge of the situation, who asked not to be named because the details were confidential. Bloomberg earlier reported the inquiry.  Early Wednesday, Apple said in a statement that it had received questions from some government agencies and that it was responding to them; the company did not specify the agencies it had heard from. The Justice Department declined to comment.  As for the wait times that Ms. Schipper and others are experiencing for a battery replacement, a spokeswoman referred to Apple\u2019s support webpage, which states that battery supplies at its stores may be limited.  Let\u2019s not wait around. Here\u2019s a guide to other solutions to keep an iPhone running in the absence of an Apple battery replacement.  Third-Party Repair Shops  Plenty of irate Apple customers are turning to local third-party repair shops to get their iPhone batteries replaced. At Mega Mobile Boston, twice as many customers are coming in for iPhone battery replacements than in years past, said Adam Fullerton, the store\u2019s operations manager.  Third-party repairs are a decent \u2014 but imperfect \u2014 solution. One drawback is that they vary in quality; some repair shops buy lower-quality batteries that don\u2019t last. So to find a good shop, rely on word of mouth and reviews on the web, similar to how you might seek out a good car mechanic.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Another issue is that if you service your phone with a third-party battery and later take your device in to Apple for repair, the company could refuse to service your phone. So if you go the third-party route, chances are you will have to stick with third-party repair shops through the end of your phone\u2019s life.

View all New York Times newsletters.  There\u2019s a less risky route here. On Apple\u2019s support webpage, you can look up third-party repair shops that are authorized by Apple as service providers. These are fixers who have been trained by Apple and carry original parts. But the list is short.  If you find a good local fixer, there are plenty of benefits to sticking with one long term. For one, third-party shops tend to have shorter waits. Mr. Fullerton said his shop could typically get an iPhone battery replacement done in about 30 minutes. The process involves opening the device, cleaning away the old waterproofing adhesive, replacing the battery and applying a new waterproofing adhesive.  For another, local repair shops make their prices competitive with the manufacturer\u2019s. In the case of batteries, many shops are discounting their battery replacements to match Apple\u2019s $29 pricing.  \u201cWe\u2019re probably losing money on it with the cost of a half-hour time from a technician,\u201d Mr. Fullerton said. \u201cBut it\u2019s like a loss leader in any other industry. If you\u2019re Best Buy and you get them to buy one item at cost, maybe you can teach them something about your business.\u201d  Finding a good repair shop can feel daunting, but if you ask around, your peers will probably have recommendations. For a sample, here\u2019s a list of highly recommended repair shops in the United States that I compiled from talking to repair experts I trust:  \u25a0 In Chicago: uBreakiFix Chicago  \u25a0 In San Francisco: MacRepair  \u25a0 In New York: Simple Mac  \u25a0 In Boston: Mega Mobile Boston  \u25a0 In Washington: Computer Geeks  \u25a0 In Austin, Tex.: Austin Mac Repair  Fix It Yourself  You can always replace an iPhone battery by yourself. The pros: You can choose the best components for repairs and minimize costs. The cons: Learning repairs can be time consuming, and if you mess up, you have no one to blame but yourself. And again, Apple stores could refuse to service your phone if it sees you have repaired it with third-party parts.  A good place to start for D.I.Y. repairs is iFixit, a company that provides instruction manuals and components for repairing devices. It is offering discounts on battery replacement kits for older iPhones, which cost $17 to $29. Each kit includes a new battery and the tools for disassembling iPhones.  Installing a phone battery can be intimidating. Replacing an iPhone 7 battery, for example, requires eight tools and 28 steps. Kyle Wiens, the chief executive of iFixit, said some customers also opted to buy a battery from iFixit and then take it to a local repair shop for installation.

But since that could take weeks or months, don\u2019t suffer with a sapped phone battery in the meantime.  A better temporary solution is to invest in a battery pack that you can carry around until replacement batteries arrive at an Apple store. Wirecutter, a New York Times company that reviews products, has tested hundreds of battery packs to recommend a few. My favorite is the Anker PowerCore 20100, which can charge a smartphone every day for a week.  Ms. Schipper, the Seattle resident, is considering buying a battery pack.

Apple has some catching up to do. Mac laptops and iPads were once the dominant devices in American classrooms, but Google has shot past Apple with inexpensive laptops called Chromebooks. Google has also led the way in software products designed specifically for schools, with an app called Google Classroom that teachers use to take attendance, assign homework and do other tasks, among others.  Of the 12.4 million tablets and laptops shipped to primary and secondary schools in the United States last year, Chromebooks accounted for 58 percent of the market, compared with a negligible share in 2012, according to IDC. In the same period, the share of iPads and Mac laptops fell to 22 percent from about half. And Microsoft Windows devices dropped to 18 percent from about 45 percent, IDC said.  School districts embraced Chromebooks because they were comparatively inexpensive and easy to use. Since the laptops were cloud-based, they could be shared among students who could pick up any device to get access to their documents. And school districts could use a software dashboard to manage thousands of devices at once. Districts that needed to institute online testing began buying Chromebooks in bulk.  Still, Apple generates the most revenue from school hardware sales in the United States, partly because its devices cost more. Of the $5.4 billion spent on school devices last year in the United States, Apple\u2019s iPads and laptops accounted for about $2.1 billion, followed by Chromebooks at $1.95 billion and Microsoft Windows devices at $1.35 billion, according to IDC.  Photo  Apple\u2019s new iPad signals how the company sees an opening at the lower end of the market. Last year, it lowered the price of its entry-level iPad to $329 for consumers and $299 for schools, helping to bolster sales of iPads after years of declines. Some Chromebooks and Windows laptops cost less than $200.

Broadcom typically slashes costs, especially research and development, and the company said it would do exactly that if it acquired Qualcomm. \u201cIn the long run that\u2019s not good for the country or for society,\u201d Mr. Dodson said.  He agreed with the Trump administration\u2019s assessment that, by cutting Qualcomm\u2019s research costs, Broadcom would be assisting Chinese rivals in the global race for dominance in 5G communications technology.  But as an investor, his reasoning can pretty much be reduced to one word: Apple.  Apple has traditionally been one of Qualcomm\u2019s biggest customers, along with Samsung and every other major handset company. But the two technology giants are also embroiled in an epic battle over licensing fees for Qualcomm\u2019s patented technology, with profound implications not only for Qualcomm\u2019s business model and Apple\u2019s profit margins, but for the future of wireless communication.  Photo  If Qualcomm and Apple can just bury the hatchet, Mr. Dodson reasons, Qualcomm\u2019s revenues would soar, and its stock price would climb well past Broadcom\u2019s offering price of $79 a share. By Mr. Dodson\u2019s reckoning, once Apple resumes paying Qualcomm, the chip maker will be worth at least $84 a share, \u201cwhich is why Broadcom\u2019s offer didn\u2019t really engage my attention,\u201d he said.  That, however, is a big \u201cif,\u201d given the intractable positions both sides have staked out.  At the heart of the dispute is the way Qualcomm calculates the licensing fee it charges customers, which is a percentage of the cost of the net selling price of the entire handset \u2014 and not the price of the chip. That means that Apple, a high-cost producer whose iPhone X sells for as much as $1,000, has paid much higher licensing fees than low-cost competitors using exactly the same chip set.  Apple has called the arrangement an \u201cextortion scheme.\u201d It infuriates Apple that Qualcomm has, in effect, been subsidizing its low-cost competitors, including the very Chinese companies that Mr. Trump says he is so concerned about.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Qualcomm has countered that its intellectual property makes many of the iPhones\u2019 distinctive features possible, features that low-cost competitors haven\u2019t replicated, and therefore Qualcomm deserves a percentage of the cost of the entire device.  Mr. Dodson made little immediate headway when he met with a delegation of top Qualcomm officials late last month and pressed his case for a settlement with Apple. The officials, including the chief executive, Steve Mollenkopf, and Paul Jacobs, a Qualcomm founder and, until recently, executive chairman, visited Mr. Dodson in San Francisco to make their case against the Broadcom bid.  In Mr. Dodson\u2019s account of the meeting, he urged the Qualcomm executives to settle with Apple rather than risk alienating it as a customer over the long term. But Qualcomm officials said that Apple was demanding more than they were prepared to give and that, on an engineering level, relations with Apple remained good. They assured him that eventually they would reach a settlement, revenues would normalize and Qualcomm stock would respond.

Still, \u201cI\u2019d like to see them budge\u201d on the licensing issue, Mr. Dodson said. \u201cI can see Apple\u2019s point.\u201d  But if Qualcomm stopped charging Apple a percentage of the device\u2019s cost, it would probably have to extend similar terms to all its major customers. It recently amended its agreement with Samsung without abandoning its approach to license fees. At the meeting, Qualcomm officials told Mr. Dodson they offered Apple similar terms, but Apple rejected them.  A Qualcomm spokeswoman declined to comment, as did an Apple spokeswoman.  Long-simmering tensions between Qualcomm and Apple reached a boiling point in 2016, when Qualcomm halted rebates it was giving Apple. Qualcomm claimed Apple had violated the terms of the rebate agreement by cooperating with South Korea\u2019s investigation into what Samsung and others said was exclusionary conduct by Qualcomm. Apple responded by withholding the license fees it paid manufacturers of iPhones, who in turn stopped passing on the payments to Qualcomm.  Photo  Lawsuits and counterclaims erupted, and Qualcomm reduced its revenue estimates by $500 million a year.  While Apple has continued to buy and deploy the latest Qualcomm chips, it also reached out to a rival chip maker, Intel, which began supplying an alternative to Qualcomm\u2019s chip for the iPhone 7. (That phone, the iPhone 8 and the X may contain either a Qualcomm or an Intel chip.)  Qualcomm claims that Apple has compromised the performance of Qualcomm-equipped handsets in order to mask their superiority over the Intel-equipped phones. (Both Intel and Apple have vehemently denied the claims.)  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Numerous lawsuits are now well underway in the United States, with some expected to go to trial later this year. Regulators in the European Union, Taiwan, South Korea and China have ruled that Qualcomm\u2019s licensing practices are unlawful and have levied fines, decisions that Qualcomm is appealing. In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission is conducting its own investigation.  While armies of patent lawyers fight over the rival claims, investors have already rendered a verdict. Qualcomm shares, after peaking at more than $80 in 2014, dropped by nearly 50 percent, hitting a low of $44 in 2016.  Qualcomm\u2019s precipitous decline is what attracted Mr. Dodson\u2019s attention along with other so-called value investors, who look for stocks trading below their intrinsic value. He said his fund\u2019s average cost per share for its Qualcomm position was about $56, so the fund was still ahead even after the deal collapsed this week. On Thursday, Qualcomm was trading at around $60.  Still, Qualcomm\u2019s performance has knocked the Endeavor fund from its perch at the top of the Morningstar rankings. So far this year, it\u2019s 61st.  Now that Mr. Trump has rescued Qualcomm from the imminent threat of a Broadcom takeover, its financial prospects \u2014 and share price \u2014 will largely follow the twists and turns in the Apple standoff. While Mr. Dodson remains optimistic about the outcome, that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s against all potential takeovers of Qualcomm.  Last week, there were rumors that Intel might launch a bid for Broadcom, which made Mr. Dodson wonder: \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t it bid for Qualcomm?

So who\u2019s left?  The same company that always seems to turn up when it\u2019s time to cross into a new era of technology: Apple.  I got to thinking about Apple\u2019s responsibility last week when two large investors wrote an open letter asking the company to do more about its products\u2019 effects on children. I was initially inclined to dismiss the letter as a publicity stunt; if you\u2019re worried about children and tech, why not go after Facebook?  But when I called several experts, I found they agreed with the investors. Sure, they said, Apple isn\u2019t responsible for the excesses of the digital ad business, but it does have a moral responsibility to \u2014 and a business interest in \u2014 the well-being of its customers.  And there\u2019s another, more important reason for Apple to take on tech addiction: because it would probably do an elegant job of addressing the problem.  \u201cI do think this is their time to step up,\u201d said Tristan Harris, a former design ethicist at Google who now runs Time Well Spent, an organization working to improve technology\u2019s impact on society.  \u201cIn fact,\u201d Mr. Harris added, \u201cthey may be our only hope.\u201d  For one thing, Apple\u2019s business model does not depend on tech addiction. The company makes most of its money by selling premium devices at high profit margins. Yes, it needs to make sure you find your phone useful enough to buy the next one, but after you purchase your phone and sign up for some of its premium services, Apple doesn\u2019t really need you to overdo it. Indeed, because it can\u2019t make infinite battery life, Apple would probably be O.K. if you cooled it with your phone a little.

Every tech company needs a presence on the iPhone or iPad; this means that Apple can set the rules for everyone. With a single update to its operating system and its app store, Apple could curb some of the worst excesses in how apps monitor and notify you to keep you hooked (as it has done, for instance, by allowing ad blockers in its mobile devices). And because other smartphone makers tend to copy Apple\u2019s best inventions, whatever it did to curb our dependence on our phones would be widely emulated.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Mr. Harris suggested several ideas for Apple to make a less-addictive smartphone. For starters, Apple could give people a lot more feedback about how they\u2019re using their devices.  Imagine if, once a week, your phone gave you a report on how you spent your time, similar to how your activity tracker tells you how sedentary you were last week. It could also needle you: \u201cFarhad, you spent half your week scrolling through Twitter. Do you really feel proud of that?\u201d It could offer to help: \u201cIf I notice you spending too much time on Snapchat next week, would you like me to remind you?\u201d  Another idea is to let you impose more fine-grained controls over notifications. Today, when you let an app send you mobile alerts, it\u2019s usually an all-or-nothing proposition \u2014 you say yes to letting it buzz you, and suddenly it\u2019s buzzing you all the time.  Mr. Harris suggested that Apple could require apps to assign a kind of priority level to their notifications. \u201cLet\u2019s say you had three notification levels \u2014 heavy users, regular users and lite, or Zen,\u201d Mr. Harris said.  Apple could set rules for what kind of notifications were allowed in each bucket \u2014 for instance, the medium bucket might allow notifications generated by other people (like a direct message in Instagram) but not those from the app itself (Instagram just sending you an alert to remind you that your high school friend\u2019s mom\u2019s brother posted a new picture recently).  \u201cAnd then Apple could say, by default, everyone is in the middle level \u2014 and instantly it could save a ton of users a ton of energy in dealing with this,\u201d Mr. Harris said.  There\u2019s a danger that some of these anti-addiction efforts could get too intrusive. But that\u2019s also why Apple would shine here; building a less-addictive phone is chiefly a problem of interface design, which is basically Apple\u2019s entire corporate raison d\u2019\u00eatre.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Another thing that Apple is good at is marketing, and I suspect it could make a lot of gauzy ads showing people getting more out of iPhones and iPads by unplugging from them for a little while. Note that it already sells a device, the Apple Watch, whose marketing extols the magic of leaving your phone behind.  Done right, a full-fledged campaign pushing the benefits of a more deliberative approach to tech wouldn\u2019t come off as self-interest, but in keeping with Apple\u2019s best vision of itself \u2014 as a company that looks out for the interests of humanity in an otherwise cold and sometimes inhumane industry.  \u201cHow we live with technology is the cultural issue of the next half-century,\u201d said James Steyer, the founder and chief executive of Common Sense Media, a nonprofit group that studies how children are affected by media.  He suggested that the feeling was ripe for Apple to tap into. \u201cIt\u2019s something that everyone cares about \u2014 whether you\u2019re a Republican or a Democrat, liberal or conservative, whether you live in San Francisco or Biloxi, Miss., you know that you and your kids are part of the arms race for attention,\u201d he said.  Apple released a statement last week saying it cared deeply \u201cabout how our products are used and the impact they have on users and the people around them,\u201d adding that it had a few features on addiction in the works.  Apple hardly ever talks about future products, so it declined to elaborate on any of its ideas when I called.

Citigroup shares climbed 2% before the opening bell following the bank\u2019s latest earnings report. Citigroup said that it lost $18.3 billion in the fourth quarter, its earnings wiped out by a $22 billion charge related to the new tax law, though revenue rose from a year earlier. Without the tax charge, the bank would have topped profit expectations.  Shares of General Electric shed 3.6% premarket. The industrial conglomerate said it expects a $6.2 billion after-tax charge in its fourth quarter after reviewing GE Capital\u2019s runoff insurance portfolio. CEO John Flannery also said the firm will examine separately traded units for its major businesses.  UnitedHealth shares rose 2.2% premarket after the health insurer\u2019s quarterly profit beat analysts\u2019 expectations and the firm raised its yearly outlook, as revenue from both its health care and health care services businesses increased.  Shares of Apple added 0.7% premarket following the news that the iPhone maker and Chinese tech giant Tencent have settled their tiff over tips, allowing users of Tencent\u2019s popular WeChat messaging app to resume giving monetary gifts to their favorite video-streaming stars and content creators.  Alphabet, the parent company of search-engine giant Google, rose 0.7% before the opening bell. Google said it is expanding its sprawling network of undersea cables to plug into new regions around the world, in a bid to speed up its cloud-computing business and catch up to rivals Microsoft and Amazon.com.  Amazon shares were up 1.1% premarket. Data was released showing products carrying the Whole Foods brand helped push sales at Amazon\u2019s online grocery-delivery service, AmazonFresh, up 35% to $135 million in the last four months of 2017 over the previous four months.  Shares of Ford Motor climbed 0.5% premarket after an executive said the auto maker will now spend $11 billion on electrified vehicles through 2022, increasing its previous estimates as it races to catch up on battery-powered cars.  Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. shares advanced 0.8% premarket. CEO Sergio Marchionne said he has no plans to sell its Jeep business or split up the company, cooling speculation but leaving the company\u2019s long-term strategy unclear. Late Friday, the firm issued a recall for more than 162,000 late model Chrysler Pacifica minivans to fix a software flaw that could stall out vehicles while being driven.  Shares of another auto maker, General Motors, also rose and were up 3.4%. The company said it will take a $7 billion non-cash charge following recent tax changes and said excluding the charge, it expects 2017 profits to come in at the high end of its guidance.  Shares of Spectrum Brands Holdings climbed 1.2% before the opening bell. Energizer Holdings Inc. said it will buy the firm\u2019s battery and portable lighting business for $2 billion in cash. Spectrum\u2019s battery portfolio includes Varta and Rayovac brands and generated $866 million in revenue last year. Energizer shares rose 12%.  Merck & Co Inc. shares surged 5.1% premarket after the drug company announced positive late-stage trial results for a lung cancer treatment.  Shares of Blackhawk Network Holdings added 24% premarket to $45.10 following the news that Silver Lake and P2 Capital Partners have agreed to acquire the financial technology firm for approximately $3.5 billion, including debt. The deal values Blackhawk at $45.25 a share, a roughly 24% premium over Friday\u2019s closing price.  Viacom shares declined 3% premarket.

Apple shares fell 1.2% premarket following a Wall Street Journal report that the iPhone maker is slashing planned production of the iPhone X for the three-month period ending March 31, in a sign of weaker-than-expected demand for the pricey handset.  Shares of MetLife tumbled 7.4% before the opening bell after the nation\u2019s second-largest life insurer by assets disclosed for the first time the scale of a records mistake that left possibly tens of thousands of workers without their monthly pension benefits. The company said it expects to increase its reserves by $525 million to $575 million on a pretax basis to account for the problem.  Amazon.com, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase said the firms are partnering on a new company to figure out how to reduce health-care costs for their hundreds of thousands of U.S. employees. Amazon was up 0.4% premarket, while Berkshire was down 0.2% and JPMorgan was up less than 0.1%.  Aetna shares fell 2.6% premarket following the insurer\u2019s quarterly sales and profit beats, though revenue dropped 5.6% in the most recent quarter from a year earlier. Other insurers were also down following the announcement from Amazon, Berkshire and JPMorgan. UnitedHealth Group, Anthem and Cigna all dropped at least 5%.  Shares of Wal-Mart were down 1.4% before the opening bell following a Journal report that the retail giant plans to ask suppliers to deliver more goods to warehouses exactly on time or face fines, another step in its efforts to keep inventory low and shelves stocked as it battles with Amazon.  McDonald's shares declined 0.3% premarket. The fast-food giant posted quarterly sales and profits that beat analyst expectations.  Shares of Maxim Integrated Products shed 11% premarket after Japanese firm Renesas Electronics denied a CNBC report saying that Renesas was in talks to acquire Maxim.  Callidus Software shares added 11% to $36.25 premarket on the news that German software company SAP SE has agreed to buy the firm for $2.4 billion to bolster its cloud-computing business. SAP will play $36 a share for the California-based firm.  Shares of Thomson Reuters climbed 11% before the opening bell following a Reuters report saying private-equity firm Blackstone Group is in advanced talks to buy a 55% stake in its financial and risk business for more than $17 billion. Blackstone was down 1.1%.  Pfizer shares were down 1.9% premarket. The drug company posted quarterly earnings and revenue that topped Wall Street expectations and gave an upbeat guidance for 2018, though sales projections for the year fell below some analyst targets.  Shares of United Continental Holdings climbed 1.1% to $66.50 premarket following a JPMorgan Chase analyst upgrade to overweight from underweight and price target increase to $83 from $60.  Harley-Davidson shares shed 6.4% before the opening bell. The motorcycle manufacturer reported its fourth straight year of declining sales and said it expects shipments to decline again this year.

Longbow Research analyst Shawn Harrison lowered his rating on the technology giant to \u201cneutral\u201d from \u201cbuy\u201d on Wednesday, reflecting the view among some Wall Street researchers that the latest group of iPhones will deliver modest sales performance. He didn\u2019t specify a price target.  \u201cWe now forecast only a good, not great iPhone cycle,\u201d Mr. Harrison wrote in a research note.  He said the more expensive price point of the X model may hinder some demand and the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus models have received a \u201clukewarm\u201d reception, both of which could restrain growth in iPhone shipments. He estimates that iPhone production growth will be in the high-single digits, lower than the consensus view of 10% that he cites.  \u201cAlthough there are now expanded drivers to AAPL\u2019s business, the iPhone continues to wag the dog,\u201d Mr. Harrison wrote. \u201cGiven our change in estimated iPhone growth profile near term, we anticipate this dynamic will limit upside stock appreciation.\u201d  Wall Street analysts have historically been hesitant to bet against Apple Inc., whose shares are up 47% over the last 12 months and 670% in the past decade. Twenty-nine of 37 analysts tracked by FactSet have \u201cbuy\u201d or \u201coverweight\u201d ratings on the stock, with an average price target of $192.73. There are no \u201csell\u201d or \u201cunderweight\u201d ratings.  The average analyst price target has increased each month for the past 14, according to FactSet data. Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts, for example, lifted their price target on the stock to $200 from $180 on Wednesday.  Shares were down 0.2% to $175.88 in recent trading Wednesday.  Many analysts have cited factors that could drive the stock higher, such as a tax-code overhaul, which is likely to encourage companies to bring home cash held overseas and could be handed to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. Apple has also seen higher demand for other products such as its Mac and iPad recently.  Longbow\u2019s downgrade appears to be the second among analysts in the last month. Nomura Instinet analyst Jeffrey Kvaal lowered his rating on the stock to \u201cneutral\u201d from \u201cbuy\u201d in December and dropped his price target to $175 from $185. He suggested that Apple\u2019s stock has historically dropped after new iPhone models come out, and this cycle appears to be no different.

Apple Inc., AAPL 0.34% Alphabet Inc. GOOGL -0.12% and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN -1.22% \u2014with a combined market value of more than $2 trillion\u2014all boosted growth by broadening their reach into new areas.  Apple\u2019s revenue rose 13% to $88.29 billion, fueled by its move to increase smartphone prices behind its new flagship iPhone X, released in November at $1,000. The company, whose profits topped $20 billion for the first time, is also increasingly benefiting from its services business, including App Store sales and music and payments services.  Google parent Alphabet has averaged revenue growth of at least 20% over the past 32 quarters, when adjusting for currency movements, according to RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney. Google is building in other areas, including cloud computing, a business that Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said brings in $1 billion a quarter.  Meanwhile, Amazon\u2014long known for prioritizing growth over earnings\u2014delivered a profit exceeding $1 billion for the first time as its revenue jumped 38% to $60.5 billion.  More than the other two companies, Amazon has spread beyond its core market. The online-retail giant has built the largest cloud-computing business, created a major Hollywood studio and, more recently, become a big bricks-and-mortar retailer with the acquisition of Whole Foods, which accounted for roughly 7% of its sales.  Two of the other largest tech companies by market value\u2014 Microsoft Corp. and Facebook Inc. \u2014reported record sales a day earlier. Revenue at Microsoft rose 12% to $28.92 billion as its cloud-computing division continued to grow, while Facebook\u2019s revenue jumped 47% to $12.97 billion.  Those companies are the five most valuable in the U.S. by market capitalization, the first time a single industry has occupied that position in several decades, according to S&P Capital Inc.  As the tech giants expand their clout across a widening band of commerce, they have increasingly drawn scrutiny from lawmakers and consumers over a range of issues, from their dominance of certain markets, to how they use their vast troves of consumer data, to the impact their products have on society.  The extraordinary runup in their share prices has helped fuel popular awareness of the companies\u2019 power, says Youssef Squali, an analyst with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.  \u201cIt\u2019s a combination of the fact that these have become such huge behemoths that they bear responsibility to society, and on the other hand you have all this lack of control of personal data,\u201d Mr. Squali said.  Facebook is contending with claims that its massive social network has had harmful effects on mental health and is used to disseminate hate speech, violent live videos and fabricated news articles. Lawmakers have scrutinized Facebook and other social-media firms, saying they failed to take more steps to keep Russian-backed actors from sowing division during the U.S. presidential election.  Facebook says it is addressing the issues in a number of ways, including employing more people who handle safety and security issues and ranking publisher posts based on user evaluations of trustworthiness.  Apple is facing criticism from prominent investors over the way smartphones affect children, as well as federal probes over its disclosure that it issued software updates that slowed performance on iPhones with older batteries. Apple apologized and said it would never do anything to harm its customers.  Google drew a $2.71 billion fine from European regulators, who said the search giant favored its comparison-shopping service over rivals. Google\u2019s YouTube, meanwhile, is grappling with a backlash from marketers over the placement of their ads in front of undesirable videos, including YouTube\u2019s curated lineup of \u201cpreferred\u201d content.  Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said on a call with analysts that new controls to review top videos on YouTube and set new limits on which content can run ads will make the site a safe place for advertisers. There have been concerns, he said, but \u201cwe\u2019re working really hard to address them and respond strongly.\u201d  A major shift for the tech industry came with the election of President Donald Trump, who had been critical of the industry in part due to what he said was a lack of U.S. job creation and investments overseas. Tech CEOs a little over a year ago met with the then-president elect. Shortly thereafter, plans for a tech council to advise the president dissolved.  Most recently, Mr. Trump called out Amazon, tweeting that the U.S. Postal Service should charge the online retail giant and other companies more to deliver packages.  The mood extends to Capitol Hill. Sen. Mark Warner (D., Va.) and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.) are working on legislation that would make political advertising with companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google more transparent. Meanwhile, U.S. Senators Jerry Moran (R., Kan.) and Richard Blumenthal (D., Conn.) this week wrote the Federal Trade Commission to ask it to investigate companies that sell fake social-media accounts, mentioning Twitter and YouTube specifically.  At the annual World Economic Forum last month, the world\u2019s largest technology companies defended themselves against complaints about everything from perceived anticompetitive behavior to threats from artificial intelligence. Some critics questioned the companies\u2019 potential elimination of jobs through advanced technology, while others pointed to their control of large amounts of personal data.  Salesforce.com Inc. CEO Marc Benioff, at the Davos, Switzerland, forum, called some tech companies\u2019 behavior \u201cnefarious,\u201d comparing the companies to the cigarette industry and calling for more government regulation. Martin Sorrell, CEO of advertising giant WPP PLC, compared the firms to Standard Oil, a U.S. oil giant that was broken up after regulators determined it was a monopoly.  In response to a question about Amazon\u2019s size, the company\u2019s retail chief, Jeff Wilke, said in an interview late last year with The Wall Street Journal that its businesses are very diverse and horizontally large. \u201cWe have incredible competition,\u201d he added.  Trip Miller, founder and managing partner at Gullane Capital LLC, which owns shares in Amazon, Apple and Alphabet, said management at the companies was strong, and they appear to have good opportunities for continued growth.  \u201cWhile we do understand some of the concerns around data and them potentially having so much information on our lives, I think it\u2019s just a byproduct of the world we live in,\u201d he said.  Apple\u2019s results offered hope that it can sustain its solid performance even amid stagnating global demand for smartphones. Analysts and investors have worried the company is too dependent on the iPhone, which accounts for about two-thirds of its revenue, as customers hold onto their phones longer and therefore buy fewer new ones.  Sales of the iPhone X in the quarter lifted the average selling price for iPhones by nearly 15%, Apple said. The 1.3 billion iPhones and other Apple devices now in active use helped its services business report an 18% jump in revenue. Results also were buoyed by strong growth in the division that includes its smartwatch and AirPods wireless earbuds.  Alphabet\u2019s profit jumped 28% to $6.84 billion, excluding a giant $9.9 billion charge related to the new U.S. tax law which turned its bottom line into the red. While the ad business makes up nearly all of its profit, Alphabet is investing in a dozen businesses such as self-driving cars and cybersecurity in hopes they will drive future revenue.  Amazon\u2019s core retail business was the main producer of its revenue growth in the quarter, as holiday shoppers went online. It also benefited from the company\u2019s $13.5 billion acquisition of Whole Foods, which generated more than $4 billion in revenue.  Amazon is known for reinvesting heavily in its business, and has said in recent quarters it is in an investment phase focusing on international expansion and building out its video content, among other initiatives.  Contributing its profitability in the fourth quarter was a tax benefit of $789 million, part of the tax overhaul. Still, Amazon\u2019s cloud-computing division put in a strong performance, as did its growing advertising business. And the company also worked on efficiency at its warehouses.

AAPL 0.34% said it will acquire Next Issue Media LLC and its digital-magazine-subscription service Texture, a product developed by top magazine companies that bundles together some 200 subscriptions into one monthly service.  The acquisition comes as Apple looks to beef up its services business, which includes music streaming and mobile payments.  Apple has set a goal of increasing total revenue from services to more than $40 billion by 2020. The company generated nearly $30 billion in services revenue in its fiscal year ended in September.  Apple typically takes a 15% cut of subscription services from publishers and content providers, including Netflix Inc. and HBO, if those subscriptions are purchased through the App Store.  Terms of the deal weren\u2019t disclosed. Next Issue Media and Texture are owned by Cond\u00e9 Nast, Meredith Corp. , Hearst Corp., Rogers Communications Inc. and KKR & Co.  The magazine industry for years has sought ways to transition from print to online, but has faced profound challenges competing with tech giants for digital ad dollars, while print ad revenue continues to decline.  Last year, Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and Facebook Inc. accounted for more than 63% of U.S. digital ad spending, according to eMarketer, while the magazine world has been buffeted by steady cutbacks and numerous rounds of consolidation.  Next Issue, which launched in 2009, was envisioned as a way for publishers to compete against tech titans like Apple, whose app store has come to dominate distribution in the digital publishing marketplace.  In a joint statement, Texture\u2019s key publishing investors said the sale was in line with the shifting marketplace the industry has faced.  \u201cThis new relationship with Apple not only will deliver new audiences and further the reach of our collective brands, but reflects the way consumers are engaging with media today as they look to discover content and subscribe with more convenience and ease,\u201d they said.  Texture, which offers a monthly, $10 subscription to magazines such as Vanity Fair, Good Housekeeping, Time, Sports Illustrated, and National Geographic, fits into Apple\u2019s effort to bring news and information to iPhone and iPad users. The company launched Apple News in 2015 and has been aggregating and providing news stories to iPhone users since then.  \u201cWe are committed to quality journalism from trusted sources and allowing magazines to keep producing beautifully designed and engaging stories for users,\u201d said Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s senior vice president who oversees the services business.

Or at least that\u2019s been the case recently. The largest U.S.-listed company by market capitalization has risen for five straight sessions, including a 3.4% jump on Thursday after regulatory filings showed Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway raised its stake in the iPhone maker last quarter.  That took Apple\u2019s price to $172.99, up nearly 12% from its recent low and pulling it out of correction territory.  The S&P 500 is similarly up for five straight sessions, marking its largest five-day percentage gain since December of 2011, according to The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Market Data Group. The index is up 5.8% from its 2018 closing low from Feb. 8, as our Morning MoneyBeat newsletter noted on Friday.  Apple and its tech-giant peers are still a leading force in the stock market, even after driving gains for most of the nearly nine-year-old bull market and especially the last year. For those trying to discern where stocks head next in an uncertain market, Apple\u2019s stock is as good a place to look as any.  Apple dropped more than 13% during the worst of the recent selloff. The company had a particularly bad session in early February, dropping 4.3% the day after an earnings report that showed the company sold fewer iPhones and projected weaker-than-expected revenue for the current quarter. Both Apple and the S&P 500 pointed slightly lower in premarket trade Friday.  The selloff proved to be short-lived. Wall Street analysts, bullish group that they are, still expect Apple\u2019s stock to keep gaining. Among the 39 whose price targets are tracked by FactSet, analysts project on average gain of 11% over the next year to a price of $192.06. The recent selloff only caused them to lower targets slightly from $193.03 at the end of last month.  Apple hasn\u2019t been pushing the market higher on its own, of course. Ten of the 11 sectors in the S&P 500 were in the green on Thursday. But the technology sector was the S&P 500\u2032s second-best performing on Thursday. What\u2019s more, it has had the second-best performance so far this year, up 5.7%.  A key driver of the sector is Apple, whose $878 billion market cap gives it a 3.5% weighting in the S&P 500, according to FactSet.

An iPhone X is seen on a large video screen in the new Apple Visitor Center in Cupertino, Calif., in November. Photo: elijah nouvelage/Reuters  Apple Inc. AAPL 0.34% is being investigated by the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission over potential securities violations related to the company\u2019s disclosure of a software update that slowed older iPhones, people familiar with the matter said.  The two probes add pressure on the tech giant to address criticism from customers and lawmakers after it acknowledged in December that it was throttling the performance of older iPhones as batteries aged. The company later apologized for the issue and slashed the price of an iPhone battery replacement to $29 from $79, hoping to win back customer goodwill.  Apple acknowledged in a statement that it is responding to questions from some government agencies, though it declined to disclose which agencies or any details regarding the questions. It also reiterated what it said in December, noting that it has \u201cnever\u2014and would never\u2014do anything to intentionally shorten the life of any Apple product, or degrade the user experience to drive customer upgrades.\u201d  The news of the investigations was reported earlier by Bloomberg.  Regulators and prosecutors often open investigations that don\u2019t result in any charges being filed, and securities investigations often take more than a year. It isn\u2019t clear why federal officials are focusing on potential securities violations involving an issue affecting customers.  Generally in such a case, the SEC could try to fault a public company for failing to make timely disclosures about material information that would affect the stock price. The company\u2019s potential liability would probably turn on whether the fallout from poor battery performance was likely to be material and whether the company delayed disclosing it or had the proper systems to detect and account for it.  Apple\u2019s stock has fallen about 4% since Apple\u2019s acknowledgment, but much of the losses have occurred in the past week ahead of Thursday\u2019s planned quarterly earnings report. Some of the declines have come amid reports of possible weaker-than-expected demand for the iPhone X. On Tuesday, Apple\u2019s shares fell 0.6% to $166.97.  Still, some analysts have said the battery issues could hit Apple\u2019s financials. Barclays said in a note this month that Apple could sell 16 million fewer iPhones this year, and lose $10.29 billion in revenue, directly related to customers choosing to replace batteries rather than replace their iPhones.  Apple last week announced it will release a spring software update with a feature that shows an iPhone battery\u2019s health and recommends when it needs to be serviced. Customers also will be able to see if the power-throttling feature is being used on their device and switch it off.  During an interview with ABC News earlier this month, Chief Executive Tim Cook said last year\u2019s update was designed to prevent users from having their phone power off during a call or while taking a photograph. He said Apple made the change to improve customers\u2019 experience and that Apple disclosed the feature at the time, though, he said people may not have been paying attention.  \u201cMaybe we should have been clearer, as well,\u201d Mr. Cook said. \u201cWe deeply apologize to anybody that thinks we had some other kind of motivation because our motivation is always the user.\u201d  Since acknowledging it throttled iPhone performance, the company has faced questions from consumer and watchdog groups in France, Italy and China. In France, the Paris prosecutor\u2019s office said early this month it opened an investigation into Apple for potential deception and \u201cprogrammed obsolescence.\u201d The investigation could lead to preliminary charges or be dropped.  Earlier this month, U.S. Sen. John Thune (R., S.D.), chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, sent Mr. Cook a letter seeking more information on how the company tracked customer complaints of processing performance and whether or not it considered offering rebates to customers who had replaced their batteries at a higher price.  Apple hasn\u2019t commented on the French investigation or Mr. Thune\u2019s letter.  Battery life and processing speeds are two of the most important features on smartphones. To prevent iPhone 6, 6s and SE devices from powering off automatically\u2014something that drew complaints last year from Chinese consumer-protection groups\u2014Apple said it updated its operating system, iOS, to slow certain tasks that required more computing power than a device could provide. It expanded the practice to the iPhone 7 in the fall.  The Apple investigations add to a mounting list of clashes between the Trump administration and tech firms over the past year, including a rollback of internet regulations that Silicon Valley had championed during the Obama era. Tech firms also have run into political trouble lately in Congress, particularly over alleged Russian online meddling in the 2016 election, but also user privacy concerns and liability for online sex trafficking.  \u2014John McKinnon contributed to this article.

Apple\u2019s dominance in classrooms has faded in the face of cheaper laptop options. Photo: Scott Olson/Getty Images  Apple Inc. said it is updating its entry-level iPad with capabilities designed to appeal to students and new software for teachers, as the company tries to recharge sales of the tablet and shore up its dwindling share of the U.S. education market.  The company Tuesday said its new 9.7-inch iPad includes a faster processor and works with the Apple Pencil stylus, which previously worked only with higher-end iPad Pro models.  The entry-level iPad\u2019s price remains at $329, the lowest-priced tablet available from the company. Schools, which receive discounts on pricing, can buy the device for $299.  The announcement, held at Lane Tech College Prep High School in Chicago, was coupled with software and support capabilities aimed at schools. They included more free cloud storage, a management system to assist schools with creating Apple IDs for students and a cloud-based app called Schoolwork that allows teachers to monitor students\u2019 progress on assignments.  The kindergarten-through-12 market represents a critical opportunity for tech companies to get young people accustomed to their operating systems. Introducing students to those systems could help sway future purchasing decisions that span the rest of their lives, said Scott Galloway, a marketing professor at New York University.  \u201cThe moment you get someone on your ecosystem, and they become fluent in your operating system, the switching costs become very real,\u201d Mr. Galloway said. A lot of consumers start on Apple\u2019s or Google\u2019s operating system and never switch, \u201cso it\u2019s logical to lock them in early,\u201d he said.  Technology companies have been pushing computers and other devices into the classroom since at least the 1970s, and Apple took an early lead with its easy-to-use operating system.  But the company\u2019s dominance faded in the face of cheaper laptop options such as Google Chromebooks from Alphabet Inc. or Windows-powered devices from Microsoft Corp. While many of those devices cost less than $300, Apple\u2019s MacBook starts at $999.  Apple\u2019s lowest-priced iPad, which got a $70 price cut last year, offers the company its best chance to compete in the cost-conscious education market.  But the addition of a Pencil and a keyboard\u2014which are necessary to take many computer-administered tests and could add more than $150 to the price\u2014make the iPad a costlier option than rival low-priced laptops, said Ben Davis, a senior education analyst with Futuresource Consulting.  Despite efforts by Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook to champion iPads as laptop replacements, iPad sales have fallen 40% from their peak in fiscal 2013 to $19.22 billion.  Losing ground to Chromebooks and Windows devices in the classroom contributed to the iPad\u2019s struggles, said Frank Catalano, an independent education technology analyst with Intrinsic Strategy.  The update to the entry level iPad is unlikely to reverse Apple\u2019s slump in education sales, analysts say. Over the past five years, Apple\u2019s share of computing shipments in the $18 billion U.S. education hardware market has fallen to 19% from 50%, according to Futuresource Consulting. Alphabet now has a 59% share, compared with Microsoft\u2019s 22%.  In addition to competing on price, Alphabet and Microsoft devices have gained ground in classrooms by offering a strong mobile-device management system that helps IT departments block students from exiting a browser during a test, Mr. Davis said.  Apple on Tuesday announced a system to enable students to share iPads, so they can log into any tablet and reach their own documents and apps. It said Apple\u2019s school management system would allow schools to create as many as 1,500 Apple IDs in minutes. The company also said it was expanding free iCloud storage for schools to 200 gigabytes from 5 GB.  The new Schoolwork app is coupled with a developer platform called ClassKit that developers can use to create apps that teachers can assign to students. It also announced a new curriculum called \u201cEveryone Can Create\u201d that allows teachers to integrate drawing, music, filmmaking and photography into lessons.  \u201cEducation is such a big part of who we are as a company and has been for 40 years,\u201d Mr. Cook said. \u201cTechnology can help teachers deliver a unique and personalized learning experience to all kids. We\u2019ve never stopped believing that.\u201d  While the iPad remains popular with children and teachers, educators have expressed frustration that they must seek out curriculum apps, rather than getting a simple suite of apps as Google provides, said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst with market-research firm Creative Strategies.  \u201cThey have done a lot on manageability, which will make a big difference\u201d for many schools, Ms. Milanesi said. \u201cWhile price has not changed for iPad, you get a lot more with it.\u201d  Write to Tripp Mickle at Tripp.Mickle@wsj.com", "stock": "AAPL", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-27", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-updates-ipad-with-stylus-support-1522167400"}, {"article": "If Apple Inc.\u2019s AAPL 0.34% iPhone X is a problem, so far it\u2019s a high-quality one.  Apple launched the expensive device later than usual during its fiscal first quarter that ended Dec. 30. The phone came on the 10th anniversary of the company\u2019s first smartphone, and was heralded by Apple and its fans as the \u201cfuture of smartphones.\u201d But an opening price of $1,000 is rich for any smartphone, and production issues appeared to keep supply of the phone relatively tight at least in the first few weeks after its early November launch.  That appeared to weigh down sales. Apple said Thursday that it sold a total of 77.3 million iPhones during the quarter, which was below the 80 million units analysts had been expecting. That made for a 1% year-over-year decline in iPhone unit sales for the quarter, though iPhone revenue popped by 13% to hit $61.6 billion. That is a signal that the iPhone X appealed to enough of the company\u2019s fan base to boost iPhone\u2019s average selling price to about $796\u2014the highest on record and a strong 15% jump from the same period last year.  That still isn\u2019t the \u201csupercycle\u201d that many investors have been expecting. And Apple\u2019s outlook for the fiscal second quarter ending in March suggests more of the same. The company projected total revenue in the range of $60 billion to $62 billion for the quarter, which would make for a year-over-year gain of 15%. Despite reports that Apple is cutting iPhone production this quarter due to weaker sales, Wall Street still had been expecting overall revenue to rise 24% in the quarter.  Apple\u2019s share price had slipped about 6% over the past two weeks, so the disappointing projection was somewhat priced in. And the company is still immensely profitable, with operating income jumping 12% year over year to a record $26.3 billion.  Any concerns about cyclical iPhone sales were somewhat soothed by Apple\u2019s service-arm revenue, which had another period of double-digit growth during the quarter. Services comprised nearly 13% of Apple\u2019s trailing 12-month revenue compared with 9% two years ago.

AAPL 0.34% will start selling its voice-activated speaker HomePod in stores Feb. 9, after a launch delay that cost the company sales during the critical holiday shopping season.  The tech giant, in announcing the sales date Tuesday, didn\u2019t explain why the product missed a promised December ship date. The HomePod can be preordered online beginning Friday.  Market leaders Amazon.com Inc. AMZN -1.22% and Alphabet Inc. GOOGL -0.12% continued to sell Echo and Google Home devices during the holidays, while Apple worked on a rival product it said wasn\u2019t ready for sale.  Amazon was the first major tech company to enter the smart-speaker market in late 2014, opening a wide lead by selling more than 20 million Echos even before tallying sales for the recent Christmas season. Its hockey puck-sized Echo Dot is estimated to account for more than half of Amazon\u2019s speaker unit sales, largely because of its lower price, which dropped to $30 during the holidays before rising to $50.  The smart-speaker shipments world-wide are expected to rise more than 50% this year to 56 million units, according to the market researcher Canalys. The U.S. will account for more than half of those sales, it said.  At $349, the HomePod costs considerably more than Amazon\u2019s latest Echo and a Google Home, whose list prices are $100 and $129, respectively.  Apple has tried to differentiate its speaker by emphasizing sound quality, particularly when playing music, over the device\u2019s ability to perform tasks.  Voice-activated speakers have moved to the forefront in a battle over what some technology analysts see as the future of computing. Virtual assistants such as Apple\u2019s Siri, Amazon\u2019s Alexa, Microsoft Corp.\u2019s Cortana and Google Assistant are expected to be embedded in more than 4 billion consumer devices by the end of 2018, allowing people to perform simple computing tasks by voice such as searching for information or turning off lights, according to the research firm IHS Markit.  From the Archives In a 2.5-hour keynote, Apple announced a slew of new hardware and software products. WSJ's Joanna Stern recaps what you need to know about the most important announcements (Originally published Sept. 8, 2017) .  Apple\u2019s Siri has a much wider presence by virtue of being featured on more than a billion iPhones and iPads. However, Amazon and Google are aiming to catch up by cutting deals to put their assistants into such products as Toyota Motor Corp. vehicles and Sony Corp. televisions. They also offer greater functionality; Amazon\u2019s Alexa, for example, can perform thousands of commands compared with hundreds by Siri.  The HomePod was the latest in a series of Apple products that faced delayed. The AirPods earbuds missed their promised ship date last year, and the Apple Watch, promised in early 2015, arrived late in April of that year.  Apple said the HomePod initially will be available in the U.S., U.K. and Australia, and will arrive in France and Germany this spring.

Photo: Scott Olson/Getty Images  The launch of Apple Inc.\u2019s AAPL 0.34% new iPad in a Chicago high school is both an effort to better serve students and one to fend off Google, which has caught up and passed the once-dominant player in the education market.  Apple CEO Tim Cook gathered media in Chicago to lay out its newest efforts geared toward the education market. They include a new suite of software services along with an updated iPad. The new tablet adds the company\u2019s latest mobile processor with some other upgrades for the same price as its predecessor. That includes a 9% price discount for schools.  Apple last updated its iPad lineup a year ago, culling some offerings while trimming the price on its flagship 9.7-inch version. That didn\u2019t arrest a long-running decline in sales for the pioneering tablet. iPad unit sales fell 4% in the fiscal year ended September, and Wall Street expects another 6% decline for the current year. But Tuesday\u2019s announcement wasn\u2019t simply Apple trying to bolster what is now its fourth-largest business, behind the iPhone, services and Mac in terms of annual revenue. The company has lost significant ground to arch-rival Google in the education market. Apple accounted for nearly half of the laptops and tablets sold in the U.S. K-12 market in 2013, while Google\u2019s Chromebooks accounted for 20%, up from 1% a year earlier, according to Futuresource Consulting. Last year, devices running Google\u2019s Chrome OS accounted for 58% of that market.

Watch the full documentary at wsj.com/docs. (Originally Published June 28, 2017) Altering that trajectory will be a major challenge, even for the world\u2019s most valuable company. Google, owned by Alphabet Inc., GOOGL -0.12% has the advantage of both price and ubiquity. The cheapest Chromebooks are about 40% less than the cheapest iPad, and Google\u2019s G-Suite of services is already widespread in schools. Gmail alone passed the 1-billion-user mark two years ago. Apple\u2019s software often gets high marks. But the company\u2019s software and services only work on its own equipment. That means the company\u2019s prospects are always closely tied to its ability to sell devices. And since those devices still drive the majority of Apple\u2019s operating profits, the company can\u2019t really afford to compete on price. Google, which doesn\u2019t even make most of the Chromebooks bearing its operating system, has no such limitations. Apple\u2019s approach has served it well overall. But in budget-constrained markets like education, the right price isn\u2019t always one the company can meet.

AAPL 0.34% is scheduled to report results for its fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 30, after the market closes Thursday. Here\u2019s what you need to know.  EARNINGS FORECAST: Earnings of $3.86 a share is the consensus of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters, compared with $3.36 a share a year ago. The company hasn\u2019t provided earnings guidance for the quarter but in November said it expects gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5% in the quarter.  REVENUE FORECAST: Revenue of $87.06 billion is expected by analysts, compared with $78.4 billion reported a year earlier. In November, Apple said it expected revenue to be between $84 billion and $87 billion in the quarter.  Dollars & Cents: Apple raised prices last year in a move that has the potential to boost overall revenue even as the number of iPhones it sells stagnates. Analysts believe the strategy paid off in December. Apple is projected to report a 1.5% increase in iPhone shipments, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet, but the $1,000 iPhone X, released on Nov. 3, is expected to lift the average selling price of the device 9% to $755. Those higher prices are expected to lift iPhone revenue 10% to $60 billion in the period. Meanwhile, Apple kept more old iPhone models on the market in December, a move that market research firm Strategy Analytics predicts helped the company increase iPhone shipments 22% in China.  Taxman: Apple in mid-January announced it would pay $38 billion in taxes on the $252 billion it holds overseas, but it hasn\u2019t said how much of that money it will bring back to the U.S. or outlined what will be returned to shareholders through buybacks or dividends. The company typically announces capital return plans in April or May and may hold off discussing it until then. But expect analysts to ask for more clarity on Apple\u2019s plans now that it no longer needs to hold cash overseas to avoid paying higher U.S. taxes. Also, look for the company to update its new effective tax rate. Morgan Stanley expects Apple to benefit from a lower tax rate of approximately 15.9% due to tax reform, adding $1.13 to its current fiscal-year earnings per share  Promised Land: Analysts and investors will zero in on Apple\u2019s revenue projections for the March quarter. With the iPhone X contributing less than two months of sales during the last quarter, many analysts had banked on strong sales in the current period because of pent up demand. Some have scuttled those projections recently amid reports that iPhone manufacturing has slowed. Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein reduced his projections for the current quarter to 53 million units from 66 million and warned the earnings call could trigger downward earnings estimates for the period. Analysts currently project revenue for the March quarter of $66.54 billion, according to FactSet.  The Great Divide: Apple doesn\u2019t break out its mix of iPhone sales by model, forcing analysts and investors to come up with their own estimates. One of the key indicators of demand is channel inventory. Apple tries to keep inventory in the five- to seven-week range. UBS analyst Steve Milunovich said that if the iPhone X is a disappointment relative to Apple\u2019s expectations, then the company\u2019s inventory levels could be higher. During its last earnings call for the quarter ended Sept. 30, the company indicated it expected healthy demand for the iPhone X by saying it increased inventory by 1.3 million smartphone units to support the iPhone 8 launch, 50% less than the 2.5 million it added during the release of the iPhone 7 in the same period a year earlier.  Trouble No More: The company\u2019s business in China is showing signs of improvement. Sales rose in the September quarter from a year earlier, marking the first quarterly gain in more than a year. Analysts expect this quarter to deliver another increase with sales projected to rise 9.2% to $17.73 billion, according to FactSet. The growth is expected to be driven by improved iPhone sales in that market and the continued strength of App Store sales.", "stock": "AAPL", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-01", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-expected-to-report-higher-prices-drove-record-quarterly-revenue-1517482800"}, {"article": "The Chicago landlord of what Apple Inc. calls its \u201cmost ambitious store\u201d has put the building on the block in a sales process that will test the power of the popular brand name in a tempestuous retail climate.  Real-estate private equity firm Walton Street Capital has hired Eastdil Secured to market the Norman Foster-designed Apple Store that opened last fall and has become a popular new attraction along the reinvigorated Chicago River waterfront.  Walton last year paid $370 million for the Apple Store, which at the time was under development, along with 401 N. Michigan Ave., the 35-story office and retail building next door.  Now the firm is hoping to sell the 20,000-square-foot Apple Store along with 10,000-square-feet of retail space in the office building for as much as $175 million, according to people familiar with the offering.  Walton would retain the office space. Real-estate investors often buy mixed-use properties and then split off the valuable retail space and sell it separately.  Eastdil and potential buyers of the Apple Store were having preliminary discussions last week at the global Mipim real estate conference in Cannes, France, according to people at the conference. Eric Mogentale, managing principal of Walton, declined comment.  The sale comes at a time when retail real-estate in general is under enormous pressure because of competition from online shopping and the contraction and failure of many big name retailers. Values of many malls and shopping centers have been falling.  Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s CEO, attended the store opening. Photo: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg News  But Apple Stores have long been the gold standard in the retail world because of the high traffic they attract. Not only do they ring up strong sales, but they also boost traffic and sales at neighboring stores.  A report by Green Street Advisors in 2016 found that average sales for 220 malls with Apple Stores came to $710 per square foot, compared with $630 per square foot for malls without Apple Stores. The study was based on a database that covered about 1,400 properties.  Apple is well aware of the power of its brand and uses it to negotiate low rents. The rent it is paying for the new Apple Store in Chicago is well below the average $400 to $500 per square foot being paid nearby along Michigan Avenue, in an upscale retail area known as the Magnificent Mile, said people familiar with the matter.  Apple began discussing the new Chicago store more than two years ago with Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who has made development of the Chicago River waterfront a big priority. More than $60 million was spent on the standalone store, which has a 32-foot-tall glass fa\u00e7ade and a thin carbon roof.  The project included the redevelopment of the surrounding plaza area so that now Michigan Avenue is linked to the riverfront by granite staircases on either side of the store. The plaza, once cut off from the water, now \u201cflows effortlessly down to the river,\u201d Jony Ive, Apple\u2019s chief design officer, said when the store opened.  The store opened in October in a ceremony attended by Mr. Emanuel and Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook.  Apple officials describe the store as the company\u2019s most ambitious partly because of its design and its connection to the river. The store is also bringing in well-known professionals to teach Apple device users about the products, an experience that isn\u2019t available at most other Apple stores around the world.

WSJ's Joanna Stern has tips on how to defuse the situation. Photo: Natalia Osipova/The Wall Street Journal.  Every night, I compose the following letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook :  Dear Mr. Cook,  Your iCloud storage is full.  Yours,  Joanna Stern  I never send it because I\u2019m not as unsympathetic as Apple, which by my count blasts out millions of annoying out-of-iCloud-storage alerts a day. Hey look! You got one just now.  I call them iCloud ransom notes. Don\u2019t pay Apple for storage and the threats will persist and all your data will be unsafe. Pay and the messages will end. Plus, you\u2019ll get some\u2026 iCloud. Whatever that is.  Apple is pretty matter-of-fact about it: \u201cWe notify our customers when they need more storage to continue to keep their information safely backed up in iCloud,\u201d a spokesman says.  If you have an iPhone, you\u2019ve probably seen one of these. Apple sends notifications to millions of customers when they need more storage space so their information remains safely backed up in iCloud. These messages can be avoided. Photo: APPLE  Yet after the holiday iPhone buying season, I began to realize that many of even the most tech-savvy people in my life don\u2019t quite understand how iCloud works. Heck, I had to go to an Apple Store\u2019s iCloud class to get some clarity. And my dad didn\u2019t know he had \u201cthe iCloud\u201d until he remembered the $1 monthly charge.  So I decided to tackle the messy, many-tendriled storage system. What do we need to understand? What does Apple need to start doing better? The following guide helps those who pay for iCloud get their money\u2019s worth\u2014and those who refuse to pay for iCloud live a happier, notification-free life.  What is iCloud?  Lose your iPhone but have iCloud? You won\u2019t lose much at all. That\u2019s the simplest way to understand this thing.  If your photos, videos, contacts and more are backed up to iCloud, they\u2019re safe and accessible from any other Apple device\u2014and most web browsers\u2014by just logging in. For a quick overview of what you actually have stored, log into icloud.com with your Apple ID and poke around.  Here\u2019s the big catch, though: Apple offers only 5 gigabytes of free iCloud storage space. That\u2019s like offering a Siberian tiger a Tic Tac for dinner. With the amount of photos and videos we take today, it\u2019s not enough. For a company with about $270 billion in the bank, I\u2019d expect it to at least match Google\u2019s 15GB of free cloud storage\u2014or beat it. Do I hear 20GB?  If you do need more, Apple charges you: $1 a month for 50GB, $3 for 200GB, $10 for 2 terabytes.  Before we dive into the rest, take out your iPhone. Go to Settings, then tap your name up top, then tap iCloud. You should be looking at a handy bar graph of your own iCloud storage allotment.  Photo: The Wall Street Journal  Chances are your bar graph is going to be dominated by two big chunks:  Backups. When your device is on Wi-Fi, locked and charging, iCloud automatically backs up all the data\u2014messages, settings, your homescreen layout, app data and more.  Photos. The Photos app has a clever trick: It uploads shots as soon as you take them. This iCloud Photo Library setting is on by default; if you turn it off, photos and videos are included in backups.  If that bar graph is getting filled up, you\u2019re probably starting to get those nagging out-of-storage notifications, which brings us to Mr. Frost\u2019s two diverging roads.  Road 1: Fine, I\u2019ll Pay  OK, so you agree to pay Apple every month.  First, you\u2019ve got to decide on a plan, and the new iCloud storage family sharing is incentive to pay for the 200GB or 2TB plans. Since last fall\u2019s iOS 11 release, you can share those buckets of storage with up to five members of your family. Don\u2019t worry, Johnny, if you upload a photo of your new vape, Mom won\u2019t be able to see it.  Whichever plan you choose should cover your phone backups and all-important photo storage. But you still need to fine-tune the way photos are handled.  On your iPhone, go to Settings, then scroll down and tap Photos. If you are worried about running out of space on your iPhone itself, select \u201cOptimize iPhone Storage.\u201d  Photo: The Wall Street Journal  This ensures that full-resolution photos and videos are stored in iCloud. You\u2019ll still see preview images on the phone, but it sometimes takes a few seconds before you can view the sharp original pic.  How do you tell what is actually backed up? You should see the update status on the bottom of the first Photos tab.  Once your backups are on track and your photos are squared away, you may find you have leftover space. This is where iCloud Drive comes into play. You can dump random files into it through the iCloud web interface, or\u2014on a Mac with the latest OS\u2014sync your Desktop and Documents files.  On iPads and iPhones, there\u2019s a new Files app, which is, confusingly, another door to iCloud Drive. Plus, you can add files in iOS through supported Apple apps such as Pages, Keynote and Notes, or through the sharing function: Tap the share button, then \u201cSave to Files.\u201d  While you can use iCloud Drive to sync files across your multiple devices, it still lacks some of the basics you get with Google Drive or Dropbox. For instance, on iCloud.com you can\u2019t upload a folder of files from your desktop.  Road 2: Nope, Not Paying  OK, you\u2019ve bought a phone for $700 or more and decided not even $1 more for Apple. Understandable.  So how do you survive with just 5GB and make the ransom notes cease? First, try to clear room. Delete backups of your old devices by going to iCloud > Manage Storage > Backup.  Photo: The Wall Street Journal  Apple doesn\u2019t offer a way to see the thousands of compressed files in these old backups. There are third party apps, such as AnyTrans, that do.  You can also thin out your current backup: Tap on the backup labeled \u201cThis iPhone\u201d then turn off third-party apps. There\u2019s no real need to back up apps like Twitter and Facebook ; just back up games that save your progress.  If that isn't enough, turn off iCloud backup altogether (iCloud > iCloud Backup). You can still manually back up your iPhone by syncing to iTunes\u2014even via Wi-Fi.  Backing up photos, of course, remains a necessity. For that, I recommend Google Photos, since it offers unlimited cloud storage for photos and videos. Photos with resolution over 16 megapixels will be downsized, but you can use Google\u2019s included 15GB of storage to keep those higher-resolution shots.  I find the transition process to be cleanest on a computer. Pull all the photos you have from your phone\u2014plus any photos that may live in your iCloud storage\u2014into the Photos app on your Mac, then go to File > Export. On Windows, use the iCloud for Windows app.  Go to Google Photos, then either drag all your photos to it, or use the uploader tool. Back on your iPhone or iPad, in the iCloud settings, turn off iCloud Photo Library and download the Google Photos app.  I leave you here with a moral challenge: Every time a storage-full message makes you mad, take to social media and urge Apple to give us 20GB free. Or just pay Apple the damn dollar.

Apple on Wednesday said an update to its operating system for iPhones and iPads this spring will include a new \u201cHealth Records\u201d feature that will import and store medical information covering allergies, conditions, immunizations, lab results, medications, procedures and vitals.  A dozen hospitals are participating, including Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore, Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles and Penn Medicine in Philadelphia.  The effort to securely simplify and democratize health records won\u2019t be easy, say physicians who watched Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google wrestle with similar efforts over the years.  Apple\u2019s late arrival to medical records, though, gives it advantages its rivals didn\u2019t enjoy, physicians say, including the benefits of more consolidated hospital networks and concentration among medical-record systems.  \u201cApple is in the right spot,\u201d said Eric Topol, author of \u201cThe Creative Destruction of Medicine\u201d and a physician at the nonprofit Scripps Research Institute. \u201cThere\u2019s a long ways to go still,\u201d he said.  Starting in 2011, the U.S. government spent an estimated $40 billion in stimulus money on health-care information technology, according to McKinsey, encouraging doctors and hospitals to install electronic-medical-records systems and triggering a massive shift toward electronic health information.  Apple said it has secured participation from two of the U.S.\u2019s largest medical-records providers, Epic Systems Corp. and Cerner Corp., which account for more than 50% of medical-records management, as well as Athenahealth Inc., ATHN -1.51% which accounts for almost 2%, according to KLAS Research, which analyzes the industry.  But Apple needs to get more hospitals to share data in order for the Health Records feature to be valuable, said Noga Leviner, co-founder of PicnicHealth, a startup that helps patients consolidate their medical records.  Some hospitals in the same system use different variations of electronic medical records\u2014even from the same provider\u2014and oftentimes don\u2019t have agreements to share data, Ms. Leviner said. People want complete medical-records information\u2014not just records from only one of their six doctors, she said.  \u201cThe government spent $40 billion on this and they failed\u201d to bring those hospitals together, Ms. Leviner said.  Another challenge: expanding information beyond simple listings such as allergies and recent lab results, she said. Tens of millions of Americans with chronic conditions need far more detailed information, such as pathology reports for cancer patients or medical images for people with knee injuries.  Apple\u2019s push into medical records is its latest effort to break into the $3.2 trillion U.S. health-care market. Last year, the company announced its first medical study of heart rhythms using the Apple Watch and it launched HealthKit in 2014, providing a way for different health apps to share information.  HealthKit helped Apple earn the trust of physicians and hospitals since it includes standards that comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, said Richard Milani, a physician at Ochsner Health System in New Orleans who focuses on tech in health care, and works with Apple.  Dr. Milani said HealthKit helped create a secure system that can be used to transfer medical records to the Health Records feature. Apple said Health Records will encrypt patients\u2019 information to protect their privacy.  Apple also is adopting the leading standard for transferring electronic records known as the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources, or FHIR, making it easier for hospitals and medical-records vendors to share information with the iPhone maker, he said.  Apple said it won\u2019t receive any health-record data. Instead, users will be able to add a health provider on their phone and import their records directly from the provider to the device. The company said the system is the same it uses for corporate email, allowing information to go from a corporate server directly to the phone without Apple ever seeing it.  Users will be able to back up their health records to iCloud, and that information will be encrypted with only users having the key to the data on their device.  Apple said it has no plans to monetize Health Records and designed the feature to create a better health experience for users.  Dr. Milani said the company has told hospitals the same thing. \u201cThe only way to monetize this is to say, \u2018We offer something a competitor doesn\u2019t offer to sell more devices,\u2019\u201d he said.  If it works, Health Records could ease a burden on patients, Dr. Milani said. He envisions a future where an iPhone user from Louisiana might be on vacation in Michigan and in need of medical treatment. Rather than the hospital having to look up that patient\u2019s records, the patient can pull them up on a phone.  \u201cThis is a consumer-empowerment move,\u201d Dr. Milani said. \u201cYou\u2019ll have all the information about you and you\u2019ll control it, and that\u2019s exactly who should control it.\u201d  Write to Tripp Mickle at Tripp.Mickle@wsj.com", "stock": "AAPL", "label": -1, "date": "2018-01-24", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-dives-into-complex-field-your-medical-records-1516832897"}, {"article": "Q.

Another potential issue is whether or not two of Hulu\u2019s owners \u2014 Disney, which owns ABC, and Comcast, which owns NBC Universal \u2014 will be able to play nicely with each other after they become owners with uneven stakes in the platform.  \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly awkward,\u201d said Rich Greenfield, a media analyst at BTIG, a global financial services firm. \u201cThe question is which way it goes: Does Comcast buy out Disney? Or does Disney buy out Comcast?\u201d  The corporate uncertainties have come to Hulu at a time of mounting losses: It lost $920 million in 2017, according to BTIG, which projects that the business will lose $1.67 billion this year. Hulu is also facing more intense competition than ever as its rivals disrupt the entertainment industry by handing out big checks. In recent months, Netflix has signed the producers Shonda Rhimes and Ryan Murphy to nine-figure deals; Amazon has pledged more than $200 million toward a \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d series; and Apple, a newcomer in the field, is shelling out hundreds of millions to create original programming of its own.  The outlook is not all bleak. According to Peter Rice, the president of 21st Century Fox, Hulu had more subscriber growth domestically than Netflix in the last two quarters of 2017. And this month, Disney signaled its commitment when its chief strategy officer, Kevin Mayer, suggested that the other streaming services now in the works at Disney would not get in Hulu\u2019s way.  \u201cWe\u2019re very much in support of growing Hulu,\u201d Mr. Mayer said at Recode\u2019s Code Media conference. \u201cIt takes an investment, for sure.

The quarter was the 10th in a row of more than 90 percent revenue growth for its flagship Azure cloud computing service, which directly competes with Amazon.com Inc\u2019s (AMZN.O) Amazon Web Services.  Amazon customers hoping to avoid being locked into one service could be helping growth, said Kim Forrest, an equity analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group. \u201cIf you\u2019re really smart you\u2019ll have not one provider but two,\u201d she said.  Since Chief Executive Satya Nadella took the helm in 2014, Microsoft\u2019s cloud business - which includes products such as Office 365, Dynamic 365 and Azure - has emerged as a major growth area.  Revenue from what Microsoft calls its intelligent cloud segment rose 15.3 percent to $7.8 billion in the company\u2019s fiscal second quarter, including 98 percent growth for Azure. Analysts on average had expected $7.51 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The nine justices will hear arguments on Tuesday in a case that pits the interests of tech companies and privacy advocates in safeguarding customer data against the demands of law enforcement in obtaining information crucial to criminal and counterterrorism investigations.  The case began with a 2013 warrant obtained by prosecutors for emails of a suspect in a drug trafficking investigation that were stored in Microsoft computer servers in Dublin. The company challenged whether a domestic warrant covered data stored abroad. The Justice Department said because Microsoft is based in the United States, prosecutors were entitled to the data.  The case is being closely watched by other countries wrestling with similar concerns, including members of the European Union. A ruling is due by the end of June.  A 2016 decision by the New York-based 2nd U.S. Court of Appeals siding with Microsoft marked a victory for tech firms that increasingly offer cloud computing services in which data is stored remotely. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration appealed that ruling to the Supreme Court.  Globally dominant American tech companies have expressed concern that customers will go elsewhere if they think the U.S. government\u2019s reach extends to data centers all around the world without changes being made to the law.  Microsoft, which has 100 data centers in 40 countries, was the first American company to challenge a domestic search warrant seeking data held outside the United States.  Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president and chief legal officer, told reporters last week the U.S. government should not be able to act unilaterally to access such data without taking into account the laws and interests of other countries.  \u201cIt\u2019s more likely to be a recipe for international tension and chaos,\u201d Smith said.  Solicitor General Noel Francisco, the administration\u2019s top lawyer in Supreme Court cases, said in court papers that a ruling for Microsoft \u201cwould hamper domestic law enforcement and counterterrorism efforts.\u201d  If the Supreme Court were to rule in favor of Microsoft, the government could still gain access data held overseas, but the process would be more cumbersome and potentially take longer.  Lawmakers are considering making changes to the 1986 law.  Bipartisan legislation has been introduced in Congress to update the statute, a move backed by both Microsoft and the administration. The measure would let U.S. judges issue warrants while giving companies an avenue to object if the request conflicts with foreign law. If Congress were to pass the bill before the Supreme Court rules, the case would likely become moot.  BEYOND REACH  Though Microsoft is based in the United States - Redmond, Washington, to be precise - the appeals court said the emails were beyond the reach of domestic search warrants obtained under a 1986 U.S. law called the Stored Communications Act.  The Microsoft customer whose emails were sought told the company he was based in Ireland when he signed up for his account.  Other companies including IBM Corp, Amazon.com Inc, Apple Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google filed court papers backing Microsoft. Google has mounted challenges similar to Microsoft\u2019s.  The administration has the support of 35 states led by Vermont who say they routinely seek access to data stored overseas, especially in cases involving child pornography.  Several foreign governments, including Ireland and Britain, filed court papers raising concerns about the U.S. government\u2019s position.  Ireland\u2019s government said in its brief that the question of how law enforcement authorities can access such information is already covered by a 2001 treaty with the United States that allows for information sharing and enforcement of court orders.  The treaty\u2019s procedures \u201crepresent the most appropriate means to address requests such as those which are the object of the warrant in question,\u201d Ireland\u2019s brief said.  The European Commission, representing the 28-country European Union, filed a brief saying that when a country is seeking data from outside its jurisdiction \u201cthe interests and laws of that foreign jurisdiction must be taken into account.\u201d  The Supreme Court has ruled twice in recent years in major cases concerning how criminal law applies to new technology, both times ruling against law enforcement. In 2012, the court held that a warrant is required to place a GPS tracking device on a vehicle. In 2014, the court ruled that police need a warrant to search a cellphone seized during an arrest.  In the court\u2019s current term, which ends in June, the justices are due to rule on another privacy issue on whether police need search warrants to access cellphone location information held by wireless carriers. Based on the Nov. 29 oral argument, the justices appear likely to rule against law enforcement again.", "stock": "MSFT", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-26", "source": "reuters", "url": "https://in.reuters.com/article/usa-court-microsoft/rpt-u-s-supreme-court-weighs-microsoft-overseas-data-fight-idINL2N1QD2B7"}, {"article": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks jumped on Wednesday and the Dow closed above 26,000 for the first time as investors\u2019 expectations for higher earnings lifted stocks across sectors.

Nearly 50 percent were found to be supported at least in part following an investigation, she said, and more than half of those resulted in the termination of an employee who engaged in unacceptable behaviour.

The Pentagon said it\u2019s making the shift to the cloud to strengthen its use of emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence, machine learning and the internet of things.  Having already won two other government cloud contacts, Amazon Web Services is widely perceived as the front-runner for the Defense Department award. Industry groups had called for multiple contract awards, which could improve the opportunities for companies including Oracle, Microsoft, Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and International Business Machines Corp.  Chanda Brooks, a Pentagon contracting officer, told the gathering Wednesday that market research shows that multiple companies are capable of meeting the requirements and that the \u201cfull and open competition\u201d would result in a single award. Van Name, of the \u200eDefense Digital Service, which recruits technology experts from the private sector for stints working on projects at the Pentagon, denied that the department is leaning toward Amazon.  \u201cIt\u2019s about the best proposal,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have no favorites.\u201d  The industry pushed back on the department\u2019s sole-source position.  Roger Waldron, president of the Coalition for Government Procurement, which represents defense contractors including Oracle, IBM and Microsoft, said \u201cgoing to a single vendor closes the market to just that vendor for a decade.\u201d  Microsoft and IBM also separately criticized the department\u2019s decision. Microsoft said it was \u201cdisappointed,\u201d while Sam Gordy, general manager of IBM U.S. Federal, called the move \u201cflawed.\u201d Google declined to comment, and Oracle didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.  Scope of Initiative  Underscoring the scope of the initiative, Essye Miller, the Defense Department\u2019s acting chief information officer, said the Pentagon\u2019s information technology covers \u201cover 1,700 data centers and approximately 500 different cloud initiatives across the department.\u201d  Seattle-based Amazon leads the cloud infrastructure market with 44.2 percent, followed by Microsoft\u2019s Azure with 7.1 percent, China\u2019s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. with 3 percent and Google Cloud Platform at 2.3 percent, based on total cloud industry 2016 revenue, according to research firm Gartner Inc.  Amazon already has a cloud contract with the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency dating back to 2013 that\u2019s valued at $600 million. The online retail giant led by Jeff Bezos has the fastest-growing lobbying arm among tech companies and has spoken to the Pentagon about cloud or procurement since at least 2016, according to federal lobbying disclosures.  Oracle\u2019s Stake  Oracle has a particular interest in how the contract is awarded because it has long-term contracts with multiple government agencies that use its flagship database to store information on their own systems. As the agencies look to switch to cloud computing and eye market leader Amazon, these moves threaten Oracle\u2019s traditional revenue sources. Oracle has tried to protect its database business by offering cloud services of its own, but has come late to that market.  Technology companies worried that the Pentagon favors Amazon point to the decision in early February to award a contract of as much as $950 million to REAN Cloud LLC, an Amazon partner, to help migrate its data to the cloud. On Monday, the Pentagon said it was unaware of the award, made by its Silicon Valley-based innovation unit, and reduced the contract to $65 million.  In a statement Wednesday, Sekhar Puli, REAN Cloud\u2019s managing partner, said that \u201cbased on the threat of legal action and protest by the old guard, the only winners in this delay are those large companies that stand to lose money if the DoD proceeds with innovation. In the meantime, the cost of maintaining antiquated government infrastructure has not subsided.\u201d  Oracle formally protested the REAN contract in February, saying the company was opening a door for Amazon Web Services and asserting that Amazon pressures clients to use REAN, according to a person familiar with the filing.  Respective Strengths  The companies competing for the Defense Department contract are expected to put their respective strengths on display as they present bids. While Amazon is the leader in cloud services, Mountain View, California-based Google emphasizes its focus on security and Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft touts its ability to move existing databases onto the cloud in stages, while keeping some tasks and data in-house if the customer wants.  The transition to the cloud could threaten on-site database providers such as Redwood City, California-based Oracle and IBM, based in Armonk, New York, that have long supplied government technology products but were later entrants into the cloud market.  \u201cFor Oracle and IBM, any government contract feels important. They\u2019re entrenched government vendors,\" said Lydia Leong, a cloud analyst at Gartner. \u201cShifts to the cloud and going off of their architecture is not a happy situation for them.\u201d  \u2014 With assistance by Mark Bergen, Dina Bass, Naomi Nix, and Nico Grant", "stock": "MSFT", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-07", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-07/amazon-oracle-microsoft-jockey-for-pentagon-s-cloud-business"}, {"article": "At Microsoft Corp.'s Dutch research facility at the Delft University of Technology, several large cylindrical metal tubes hang from the ceiling.  Each tube - a dilution refrigerator used to cool circuits down to temperatures colder than deep space - costs more than $500,000, and has helped Microsoft's researchers create an elusive subatomic particle that the company hopes will serve as the building block of its effort to create commercially-viable quantum computers.  The scientists say they have clear evidence of the creation of Majorana fermions \u2013 an elementary particle that its own anti-particle \u2013in a tiny wire that is composed of both semiconducting and superconducting materials, according to research published in the journal Nature Wednesday.  A clean room where nanowire circuits are manufactured at Microsoft's research facility. Photographer: Jeremy Kahn/Bloomberg  The unique properties of these fermions means that they could be used to create quantum computers with much lower error rates than the designs being trialed by rival companies, such as International Business Machines Corp. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, that are also racing to bring quantum computers to market. Currently, those other designs produce too many errors in their calculations to be useful for practical applications, such as the ability to create new chemical catalysts or break the most popular forms of encryption.  Microsoft will now attempt to braid these tiny fermions to create qubits \u2013 the fundamental calculating hardware used in quantum computers. Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s chief executive officer, has said that quantum computing is one of three breakthrough technologies \u2013 the others are artificial intelligence and augmented reality \u2013 that will be critical to the future of the company. Microsoft hopes to eventually rent time on quantum computers to businesses through its cloud computing network.  So far, Microsoft\u2019s efforts have trailed some of its competitors. D-Wave Systems Inc. in 2011 became the first company to sell a quantum computer, although its technology can only perform a certain subset of mathematical problems. Google and IBM have machines that are thought to be close to achieving \u201cquantum supremacy\u201d \u2013 the ability to tackle a problem too complex to solve on any standard supercomputer.  Microsoft, in contrast, hasn\u2019t yet managed to create a working qubit.  The company has devoted significant resources to prove that it can use Majorana fermions to build a less error-prone \u2013 and thus potentially more useful \u2013 machine. The existence of particles that would also contain their own anti-particle was postulated by Italian theoretical physicist Ettore Majorana in 1937. But researchers only observed evidence suggesting the unique fermions actually existed in 2012. But, as the Microsoft researchers write in Nature, data from these earlier experiments \u201cwere noisy,\u201d leading skeptics to speculate that they could be caused by other phenomena. In the new paper, the Microsoft scientists offer much clearer data that, the company says, should silence any remaining doubters.  The U.S. tech company has assembled a globe-spanning team of scientists for its quantum effort, working at labs in the U.S., the Netherlands, Denmark and Australia. It has also put one of its most experienced executives, Todd Holmdahl, who previously delivered both the Xbox game console and the HoloLens augmented reality goggles, in charge of the project. Holmdahl said in an interview with Bloomberg in November that Microsoft would have a quantum computer on the market within five years.  At Delft, Leo Kouwenhoven, a physicist who now works as the principal researcher for the company, gave a tour of the lab, which is also shared by academics working on several different approaches to building a quantum computer \u2013 including a rival team that is funded by Intel Corp. Microsoft soon plans to move into an entire wing of a different building as it scales up its quantum computing project.  Next to a few of the fridges are giant metal doughnuts \u2013 150-pound magnets that the Microsoft team is using to try to create the braiding, essential for their qubits to be less-error prone. The magnets, Kouwenhoven admits, are a double-edged sword, as their size and weight also make the experiments more difficult to run. He said Microsoft believes the calculations of its quantum computer \u2013 assuming it actually manages to create one \u2013 will be between 1,000 and 10,000 times more accurate than what existing machines have been able to achieve.  Kouwenhoven said it is his group\u2019s goal to have produced a working qubit using Majorana fermions by the end of this year. On the floor above where the refrigerators are installed, young graduate students sit at computers analyzing colorful graphic displays that show what is happening inside the circuitry deep within the refrigerator. Kouwenhoven stops to ask if one if he has been able to see indications of Majorana fermions braiding as they have ramped up the power of their magnets. \u201cNo,\u201d the student shakes his head. Kouwenhoven shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s harder to get accurate measurements at higher magnetic energies,\u201d he says. \u201cSo far we haven\u2019t seen evidence of this transition to topological phase.\u201d Theory, Kouwenhoven knows, is on his side.

In his typical hyper-excited, semi-shouting style, Ballmer capped his presentation with, \"Windows! Windows! Windows!\"  That was then. Windows hasn't been the heart and soul of Microsoft for several years, and Microsoft made it extra official last week. In a corporate reorganization, Windows was effectively downgraded in the Microsoft corporate hierarchy. The person now in charge of Windows occupies a lower rung of the organization than his predecessor did and reports to the senior executive in charge of Microsoft's current top priorities: corporate software, cloud computing and artificial intelligence.  It was a bureaucratic shift but one charged with symbolism. Windows is no longer the sun in Microsoft's solar system around which all other planets spin. Windows is an outlying moon -- an important one, but still just a moon. \"The future of Windows is bright,\" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in an email to employees on Thursday. It seemed like an afterthought.  Windows! Windows! Windows! Microsoft's Windows revenue has remained relatively steady in the last decade, but the software accounts for a shrinking share of total company revenue Source: Gadfly calculations from Microsoft financial disclosures.  Microsoft's corporate reshuffle reflects the company's financial reality. In 2010, the Windows systems for personal computers were the biggest source of revenue for the company, making up about 28 percent of total sales. In Microsoft's most recent fiscal year, Windows was only the third-biggest source of revenue, behind the Office software bundle and a group of technologies for businesses including computer server software, databases and Microsoft's Azure cloud-computing service. Windows' share of total company revenue was just 16 percent after adjusting for Windows sales that the company spreads out over multiple years.  By design, Nadella -- who's been the boss for four years -- has broken sharply from his predecessors, Bill Gates and Ballmer. And nothing signaled that dividing line between Microsoft's past and future more than Nadella's choice to de-emphasize Windows.  The changing focus was clear from his first months on the job. In a 2014 memo to employees that was Nadella's first mission statement as CEO, he peppered 10 mentions of the Windows operating system for PCs into a roughly 3,000 word missive, and not until the 21st paragraph. He used the word \"cloud\" 21 times.  Heart and Soul Windows was the third-biggest source of revenue for Microsoft last year Source: Microsoft  Nadella's first significant product unveiling as CEO was a version of Microsoft Office tailored to iPads. The software had been developed when Ballmer was still in charge, but it sat on a shelf as the company debated whether the Office app for iPads would hurt Windows sales. Fear of harming the Windows franchise won out until Nadella arrived.  Under Nadella, Microsoft has also made Windows less of a software Big Bang. The entire company used to be organized around developing and releasing a significant new edition of Windows every three years or so. Now, Windows is just another piece of software or app that gets updated continually, like Netflix or Apple's iPhone operating system.  There's less a new version of Windows than many slightly new ones that come out regularly. Microsoft also made those regular updates part of the cost of buying a new computer or signing a contract for a fleet of business PCs rather than paying for a new machine or upgrading the operating system when a new version comes out. It's remarkable how smoothly Microsoft managed a fundamental change to how Windows is developed and released to the public.  Even if Microsoft had kept stressing Windows, the technology world was moving away from it. Personal computer sales have been declining since 2012. Adding up smartphone, tablet and PC sales, Windows software powers less than 15 percent of all the computing devices sold in the world each year. And Windows is nonexistent in emerging areas of technology including driverless cars and internet connected devices for the home.  Microsoft's answer has been to stress areas of technology where it is relevant and has opportunities to lead in the future. That goes back to cloud computing, artificial intelligence and corporate software. All the data amassed by autonomous cars has to be saved somewhere, and it requires hefty computing power to analyze it all. Microsoft wants to be in the middle of all that. The company just won't be there with Windows, Windows, Windows.

Apple still collects our data \u2014 and reserves the right to share it \u2014 but the company has a much better track record than newer tech titans.  \"The truth is, we could make a ton of money if we monetized our customer \u2014 if our customer was our product,\" Cook said on Wednesday. \"We've elected not to do that.\" Asked what he'd do if he were in Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's shoes, he replied, \"I wouldn't be in this situation.\"  In reality, Apple collects more information about its customers than Facebook because it offers more products and services. It knows everything from an iPhone's location to its owner's taste in movies and music. It's all in the company's privacy statement, including the frank admission that Apple will share the data with \"strategic partners that work with Apple to provide products and services, or that help Apple market to customers\" and with law enforcement. Apple also lets applications that run on its platform (including Facebook) hoover up data. And it does have a small ad platform that allows targeted advertising.  Apple's closest equivalent in terms of data collection, sharing and \"pass-through\" to app developers is Google, which offers roughly the same array of services (plus search) and also owns mobile and desktop operating systems. The difference is that Apple has imposed some voluntary restrictions on itself: For example, it anonymizes location data (unless you're using the \"Find My iPhone\" feature) and generally employs \"differential privacy\" \u2014 a cryptography-based practice of obtaining usage and preference data without linking it to specific users. Google and Microsoft also use that to some degree, and a co-inventor of differential privacy, Cynthia Dwork, has even worked for Microsoft Research, but Apple was the first to market the technique as an advantage for its customers.  Cook clearly thinks of these self-restrictions as a good way of staving off external regulation. On Wednesday, he scolded Facebook for not being as far-sighted. \"I think the best regulation is no regulation, is self-regulation,\" he said. \"However, I think we're beyond that here.\"  As a user, however, I wouldn't put much trust in any company's ability to regulate itself. Cook has been wary of monetizing Apple's user base, but he won't be CEO forever. And people do change their mind, especially when it comes to picking up money that's there for the taking. Regulation \u2014 such as the EU's General Data Protection regulation, launching in May \u2014 is a more reliable way to ensure a level playing field. That's why Google, Apple and Microsoft all have good, convenient privacy controls which allow the user to turn off various kinds of data collection, erase data that companies already have and opt out of targeted advertising. Facebook, too, promises to put such controls in place soon.  But even external regulation isn't a reliable guarantee of privacy. Most people won't fiddle with the controls because they may not even realize what all the fuss is about. And by default, companies with advertising-based business models will want to collect as much information as they can and anonymize as little of it as they can. Neither Google nor Facebook, for example, will make the same commitment as Microsoft that no ads will be targeted based on your email and chat contents. Nor will they make it as easy as Apple and Microsoft make to shut off ad personalization.  No regulator will take care of that: It's not their goal to kill off the ad-based business model and with it Facebook and Google, and the model won't work without data collection and ad targeting.  The only real guarantee that companies won't go overboard in invading customers' privacy is that they have large revenue streams which make it an unnecessary risk. Apple is reliable in this regard: It's a hardware company that also sells content and software on commission and on a subscription basis. Microsoft, with its cloud, software licensing and subscription businesses, is even less likely to go rogue in data collection because it no longer has a mobile platform to speak of.  That's why Microsoft and Apple aren't suffering much from the Cambridge Analytica-triggered tech sell-off. Microsoft shares are up 4.5 percent since the beginning of the year, Apple shares are down just 1.63 percent. That compares to Google's 4.6 percent drop and Facebook's 13.3 percent dive. I believe the gains made by Twitter and Snap, two companies fully dependent on ads and information-gathering, are a temporary fluke: They aren't as frequently mentioned in connection with data harvesting as Google and Facebook. As heavier regulation of the ad model becomes reality, they will inevitably suffer as much as their ad-based peers.  Monetization through ads was the only relatively easy choice for companies not offering any products or services that people wanted to buy. That revenue stream, however, is not as easy to hold on to as those coming directly from customers. Those of us who remember the fat days of ad-financed media know that better than anyone. The tech firms that fell back on ads will need to offer value to customers, not advertisers, as the best \"legacy\" media companies have learned to do.

The law, enacted March 23 as part of the massive spending bill, lays out rules for international data requests by law enforcement. It gives tech companies an easier way to navigate conflicts between government demands and customer privacy expectations.  The Supreme Court case, which the justices heard in February, stemmed from the government\u2019s use of a 1986 law to seek emails from an unidentified account kept on a Microsoft Corp. server in Ireland.

Many developed economies have actually seen productivity stagnate or decline.    A survey from Microsoft Corp. is bolstering one theory about this disconnect. In a poll of 20,000 European workers released Monday, Microsoft, which became one of the world\u2019s most profitable companies by marketing office productivity software, acknowledges new digital technology can, in some circumstances, sometimes not lead to any increase in productivity and actually result in less employee engagement with their work.    Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft joins a growing number of prominent Silicon Valley companies and entrepreneurs that are starting to question the social benefits of the technology they once championed. Facebook Inc. warned in December that its social network might, in some cases, cause psychological harm.    Microsoft identifies a number of instances where technology can be a drag on productivity, including: workers who are too distracted by a constant influx of e-mails, Slack messages, Trello notifications, texts, Tweets \u2013 not to mention viral cat videos \u2013 to concentrate for sustained periods; workers who aren\u2019t properly trained to use the new technology effectively; tech that isn\u2019t adequately supported by the business, forcing workers to lose time because \u201cthe computers are down;\u201d and workers who suffer burnout because, with mobile devices and at-home-working, they feel tethered to the job around-the-clock.    Of course, Microsoft isn\u2019t saying that technology dampens productivity in all cases. Instead, it says that tech\u2019s impact depends largely on the culture of the business. Those with a \u201cstrong digital culture\u201d saw productivity gains from technology while those with what Microsoft termed a \u201cweak digital culture\u201d didn\u2019t.    Microsoft defined companies with a strong digital culture as those where employees had proper training in the new technology, access to information, managers who promoted the adoption of new technology, and where executives conveyed to employees a clear sense of how the technology fit into the company\u2019s strategic vision.    In such businesses, about 22 percent of employees reported feeling highly productive and only about 5 percent reported feeling unproductive, compared with just 12 percent reporting they were highly productive and 21 percent feeling unproductive in companies deemed to have a weak digital culture. The study\u2019s authors noted that even 22 percent reporting high productivity \u201csuggests there is still more work that can be done to help every employee do their best work.\u201d    The survey also found digital culture had a big impact on how new technology changed employees\u2019 feelings of engagement with their work. In businesses with a strong digital culture, increased use of technology also boosted employees\u2019 feelings of passion and focus. But, in companies with a weak digital culture, it had the opposite effect: the more technology the company deployed, the less attached workers became.    In an introduction to the study, Michel van der Bel, Microsoft\u2019s president for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said businesses should look at the adoption of new digital technology as \u201ca people journey\u201d and not just \u201can IT exercise.\u201d", "stock": "MSFT", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-05", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-05/microsoft-says-it-s-true-cat-videos-distract-workers"}, {"article": "The rapidly advancing area of artificial intelligence will require a new field of law and new regulations governing a growing pool of businesses involved, according to Microsoft Corp., a 25-year participant in AI research.  Companies making and selling AI software will need to be held responsible for potential harm caused by \u201cunreasonable practices\u201d \u2013 if a self-driving car program is set up in an unsafe manner that causes injury or death, for example, Microsoft said. And as AI and automation boost the number of laborers in the gig-economy or on-demand jobs, Microsoft said technology companies need to take responsibility and advocate for protections and benefits for workers, rather than passing the buck by claiming to be ``just the technology platform\u2019\u2019 enabling all this change.  Microsoft broaches these ideas in a 149-page book entitled \u201cThe Future Computed,\u201d which will also be the subject of a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, next week. As Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft seeks to be a leader in AI and automating work tasks, it\u2019s also trying to get out in front of the challenges expected to arise from promising new technologies, such as job losses and everyday citizens who may be hurt or disadvantaged by malfunctioning or biased algorithms.  \u201cWe are trying to be clear-eyed in talking about the challenges,\u201d said Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith, who will sit on the Davos panel and co-wrote the introduction to the book.  Microsoft is working on some of these areas through groups such as the Partnership on AI, which includes rivals like Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, Apple Inc. and Facebook Inc. Still, the call for more regulation in an emerging area like AI is unusual for technology companies, said Ryan Calo, a professor at the University of Washington School of Law, who has read the book.  \u201cThere are a bunch of players in this space, and if you are Microsoft you want to be seen as trusted,\u201d said Calo, who did not assist the company on the book but has consulted for it on other issues and whose lab is partially funded with donations from Microsoft.

The development of laws will come a few years after that, Smith said.  In the nearer term, Microsoft is advocating for changes to labor laws to properly classify workers and allocate benefits like health care and retirement planning to people with jobs such as an Uber driver or Postmates delivery person. Smith expects there will be a need for a new category of worker to cover these employees, who are neither full-time nor independent contractors, he said.  \u201cThe technology industry needs to engage to change the perception that it reaps the benefits of technology progress at the expense of workers who are displaced or left without protections, benefits or long-term career paths,\u201d the company writes in the book. \u201cCompanies that do not acknowledge the importance of worker protections and benefits risk damage to their brands and face the possibility that lawmakers and the courts will step in to impose regulations.\u201d", "stock": "MSFT", "label": 1, "date": "2018-01-18", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-18/microsoft-says-ai-advances-will-require-new-laws-regulations"}, {"article": "Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft Corp. and the second-richest person in the world, said there\u2019s a danger that U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach could damage the U.S.\u2019s influence in Africa in the long term.

It\u2019s also a rare occasion for an Apple confab outside its home state of California.  A second grader works on an Apple Inc. iPad in Sandy, Utah. Photographer: George Frey/Bloomberg  In Chicago, the world\u2019s most-valuable technology company plans to show off a new version of its cheapest iPad that should appeal to the education market, said people familiar with the matter. The company will also showcase new software for the classroom, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private plans. Apple declined to comment.  Steve Jobs made schools a priority for Apple early in its life. But as the company has driven toward mass-market and higher-margin products in recent years, Google and Microsoft have had success breaking into classrooms with inexpensive laptops and tablets. Last year, the global educational technology market generated $17.7 billion in revenue, according to research firm Frost & Sullivan.  Apple accounted for 17 percent of mobile computing shipments to American students in kindergarten through high school, according to data from the third quarter published by Futuresource Consulting. Devices running Google\u2019s operating systems on Chromebooks or Android tablets held 60 percent of the market, and Windows PCs had 22 percent. While Macs and iPads make up less than 20 percent of Apple\u2019s sales combined, students and teachers are a key market to drive future purchases.  A new, cheaper MacBook laptop is in the works and likely destined to replace the MacBook Air at a price less than $1,000, but it probably won\u2019t be ready in time for next week, the people said. The MacBook Air, introduced about a decade ago, hasn\u2019t seen a major change since 2010, the same year the iPad came out. Although the laptop is popular with college students, it has languished as Apple focuses on more expensive Macs.  Rival laptops have made inroads into the education market lately, a field that originally helped Apple make its name. The sector is prized among industry giants because students learn to use a certain type of device, then head into the workforce and spread the technology wider.  With a recent advertising onslaught, Apple is hoping to capture more young minds with the iPad. The company has revised its tablet strategy over the years by releasing different versions at a variety of price points. That\u2019s helped the iPad business return to growth after multiple declining quarters. Still, demand for tablets is weak. According to research firm IDC, the market shrank by about 7 percent in 2017. Apple grew 3 percent last year and leads the industry with about a quarter of the market.  Apple's Tablet Roller Coaster iPad growth is returning after sales slowed for several quarters  Apple currently offers a slew of different education-related software. The company\u2019s Classroom app for the iPad lets teachers manage Apple devices that are assigned to students for their classwork. There\u2019s also an iTunes U app that lets teachers issue homework, grade assignments and post lessons online. It also lets students complete assignments and take tests. The company offers a software coding curriculum via the Swift Playgrounds app and sells interactive textbooks through its e-book store.  More software is coming. Apple is working on a new version of the iBooks app that\u2019s more in line with the design of the App Store, though it\u2019s unclear if it\u2019ll be shown next week, people familiar with the project have said.  In an invitation to the Chicago event, Apple said it will introduce \u201ccreative new ideas for teachers and students.\u201d Having a venue where attendees can see the new technology in action inside a classroom would be a sound strategy for a company that focuses its announcements on live demonstrations.  Next week\u2019s event will also provide an opportunity for Apple to boast about the work it\u2019s doing with Chicago schools. In December, the company partnered with the city\u2019s public school system and City Colleges of Chicago on a coding curriculum for thousands of local students. Apple has also discussed additional education-related programs with the city, people familiar with the talks said.  According to Apple\u2019s website, the school where the event will take place is not an \u201cApple Distinguished School,\u201d a designation given to institutions with curriculum that uses Apple products and provides iPads to all students.  Apple has tried citywide iPad deals for students in the past, with little success. In 2013, the Los Angeles Unified School District said it would spend $30 million to provide some students with iPads. The deal was expected to become a $1.3 billion initiative to give every student in the district an iPad, but it fell apart.  Such a deal won\u2019t be announced with Chicago next week, people familiar with the plans said. But the city could see more of Apple in the future. According to a recent Bloomberg analysis, the company could be eyeing the Midwest for a major new office.  \u2014 With assistance by Debby Wu", "stock": "MSFT", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-23", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-23/apple-will-return-to-its-roots-with-education-tools-and-new-ipad"}, {"article": "The tech industry takes on the Trump administration at the U.S. Supreme Court Tuesday in a high-stakes clash over digital privacy and government access to information stored on overseas servers.  At issue is whether federal and state law enforcement officials can use a decades-old law to demand user emails and other data held abroad by domestic companies including Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and Microsoft Corp.  The case calls on the justices to decide how a law older than the World Wide Web itself applies in the era of cloud computing. What they say could have sweeping consequences -- that is, unless Congress acts on pending proposals to overhaul the law and set out a more nuanced approach.  \u201cThe court is presented with two pretty stark choices,\u201d said Jennifer Daskal, a professor at American University\u2019s Washington College of Law. There are \u201cproblems with either side winning,\u201d she said.  The case stems from a federal effort to use the 1986 Stored Communications Act to get emails from an unidentified account kept on a Microsoft server in Ireland. The government, which says the emails would show evidence of drug trafficking, got a search warrant in 2013. Microsoft refused to turn over the information, deciding to fight the matter in court instead.  Beyond U.S. Borders  Microsoft says the government is improperly trying to use the 1986 law in a foreign country. The Supreme Court is generally loath to say a federal law applies beyond the U.S. borders.  The government is trying to \u201cunilaterally reach into a foreign land to search for copy and import private customer correspondence physically stored in a digital lockbox on a foreign computer where it\u2019s protected by foreign law,\u201d said Joshua Rosenkranz, the lawyer who\u2019ll will argue the case for Microsoft.  The Trump administration, which inherited the case from President Barack Obama\u2019s legal team, says it\u2019s not trying to apply the U.S. law overseas. Officials served the warrant on Microsoft at its headquarters in Redmond, Washington, and disclosure of the email content would occur domestically as well, U.S. Solicitor General Noel Francisco said in court papers.  The law \u201cfocuses on disclosure, and the disclosure of records from Microsoft to the government would occur in the United States,\u201d Francisco argued.  Microsoft stores email content at more than 100 data centers in more than 40 countries. The company says it uses so many sites for the sake of speed, putting users as close as possible to their data.  Most Frequent Location  At the time of the search, Microsoft\u2019s policy was to store email content in the data center nearest to the customer\u2019s self-declared country of residence. The company has since changed its system so that it relies on the user\u2019s most frequent location.  Other companies store their data differently. Google breaks files into pieces that get stored separately and are constantly being moved from place to place. Google, Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. are among the many tech companies supporting Microsoft.  Business groups say a ruling in favor of the government would prompt users to shun U.S. cloud service providers in favor of foreign-based companies that could offer stronger privacy protections.  Privacy advocates also say such a ruling would invite reciprocity by foreign governments, putting the data of American users at risk from those governments even if it\u2019s held on servers in the U.S.  \u201cIf we say our process works abroad, you can bet that the rest of the world is going to say its process works here,\u201d said Greg Nojeim, senior counsel at the Center for Democracy and Technology in Washington.  \u2018Slow and Uncertain\u2019  The Trump administration says the consequences would be greater if the U.S. were to lose. Although the government would still be able to invoke treaties with some nations to get legal help, the administration says those cover less than half the world\u2019s countries and often mean a \u201cslow and uncertain\u201d process.  States also can use the Stored Communications Act, and 35 of them -- though not tech-heavy California or Microsoft\u2019s home state of Washington -- filed a brief backing the federal government.  \u201cThe business decisions of private corporations should not control whether law enforcement can obtain evidence of crimes committed in their jurisdictions,\u201d the states argued.  The all-or-nothing nature of the Supreme Court dispute is one reason people on both sides are urging Congress to step in, possibly even before the court can rule.  A bipartisan proposal known as the Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act, or Cloud Act, has support from both Microsoft and the Justice Department. It would make clear that U.S. warrants apply around the world, while also setting up a new process for providers to challenge warrants. The law also would put in place new rules for American companies when they receive information requests from foreign governments.  \u201cThe court doesn\u2019t have the tools to figure out the best balance,\u201d said Rosenkranz, the lawyer for Microsoft. \u201cIt\u2019s a policy decision that requires a scalpel, and all the court has is a meat cleaver.\u201d  The case is United States v. Microsoft, 17-2.  \u2014 With assistance by Ben Brody, and Dina Bass", "stock": "MSFT", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-26", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-26/tech-takes-on-trump-as-supreme-court-looks-at-data-stored-abroad"}, {"article": "Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and Apple Inc. have thrown their support behind proposals in Congress to deal with cross-border data requests from law enforcement -- even as the issue heads for review before the U.S. Supreme Court.  The companies, along with Facebook Inc. and Oath Inc., on Tuesday signed letters welcoming bipartisan House and Senate versions of the Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act, or Cloud Act.  Separately, according to a statement from the office of British Prime Minister Theresa May, President Donald Trump told May on Tuesday that passing the proposals was \"vital\" to the two countries\u2019 security.  The White House said in its own statement that Trump and May would \"advocate for legislation\" around a pending data agreement like the one in the congressional proposals. The White House, however, did not mention a specific bill.  The Cloud Act, according to a statement from its sponsors, would allow the U.S. to make agreements with foreign countries for dealing with law enforcement requests.  The legislation would also make clear that U.S. warrants apply around the world, while allowing technology companies to notify foreign governments of any requests -- as well as a process for challenging them.  \"The new, bipartisan Cloud Act is an important step toward enhancing & protecting privacy while reducing international legal conflicts,\" Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith tweeted on Tuesday.  In October, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a case stemming from a 2013 request by federal authorities for data held overseas by Microsoft and other companies. Microsoft has refused to turn over the information, calling for a legislative solution. It has supported previous legislative proposals on the issue.  The Justice Department supports the legislation, Representative Doug Collins of Georgia said in the sponsors\u2019 statement. The White House and Justice Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday evening.  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is also supporting the proposals, while the Center for Democracy & Technology, a policy institute in Washington, objected that they do not do \"enough to protect the privacy of internet users\" and would \"erode trust in the privacy of data stored in the cloud.\"  In October, Microsoft dropped another lawsuit against the Justice Department over the privacy of customer data after the department moved to scale back the use of orders forcing technology companies to turn over data without alerting users.  \u2014 With assistance by Dina Bass", "stock": "MSFT", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-07", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-07/tech-companies-welcome-cross-border-data-search-legislation"}, {"article": "In the 1990's, the U.S. only had one purported monopolist to worry about, Microsoft Corp. Now we have at least three, Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Facebook Inc.  It's almost too many to be angry about at once.  Two notable magazine pieces dug into the power of these tech giants this month. Both articles are worth sitting down with when you have some time. Last week, Wired looked at Facebook's handling of Russian meddling in the U.S. presidential election, capturing growing animosity that seems to be coming at the company from all corners lately.  On Tuesday, the New York Times Magazine published \"The Case Against Google.\" The piece recounts how Google crushed a small search competitor and how the European Commission stepped into the regulatory void to fine Google $2.7 billion. (Google is appealing).  The most compelling part is the depiction of regulators' fight with Microsoft: Even though they failed to punish Microsoft in any meaningful way, the media scrutiny, paired with antitrust monitors, had a significant effect on the company's behavior -- simply because employees got nervous.    \"Microsoft was so powerful, and Google so new, that the young search engine could have been killed off, some insiders at both companies believe,\" the author writes. He quotes Gene Burrus, a former Microsoft lawyer: \u201cThere was a new culture of compliance, and we didn\u2019t want to get in trouble again, so nothing happened.\" The piece questions the myth that Google humbled Microsoft on its own. \"The government\u2019s antitrust lawsuit is one reason that Google was eventually able to break Microsoft\u2019s monopoly.\"  But today Google, despite the historic fine it faces, doesn't seem scared. I suspect the company realizes it isn't enemy number one, at least in the U.S. While regulators might have the most legitimate antitrust case against Google, as demonstrated by the EU decision, rising ill-will toward tech giants and their billionaire leaders isn't focused on the search giant. That scrutiny is falling more on Facebook for reasons that have little to do with antitrust violations.  Politicians and others are hammering Facebook for fake content and a broader lack of authenticity. But it's important to note that the company is part of a growing digital advertising duopoly with Google in the U.S. If attention is the new economy online, they dominate our time spent. If it's data about our lives, they have the most of that, too.  And we haven't event talked about Amazon yet. Cities are prostrating themselves at the company's feet, trying to secure its second headquarters. Amazon can do no wrong in consumers' eyes. But if you talk to bankers or business people, Amazon is the one that strikes the most fear in their hearts. It controls more than two-thirds of the U.S. e-book market now. Amazon alone has the stock market's support to enter new industries, drive margins to zero and destroy rivals in search of more scale. It's great for shoppers and terrifying if you're in the grocery or pharmaceutical business.  So if you're a politician looking to quell public concern, or a regulator trying to even the online playing field, what do you do? Do you go after Facebook, the most-derided in the group of late? Do you go after Amazon, whose growth is so staggering that it is responsible for 27 percent of the S&P 500's gains so far this year? Or do you go after Google, a company that makes it easier to figure out where to get the best burrito -- even if that information used to be scraped without permission from reviews at rival Yelp? Or do you make some noise, then end up doing nothing?  This article also ran in Bloomberg Technology\u2019s Fully Charged newsletter.

The Trump administration is challenging a lower-court ruling that barred federal law enforcement officials from using the 1986 Stored Communications Act to get a suspected drug trafficker\u2019s emails, which were kept on a Microsoft server in Ireland. During an hour-long argument, the justices struggled to decide how a law older than the World Wide Web affects law enforcement in the era of cloud computing.  Chief Justice John Roberts suggested Microsoft\u2019s argument would put out of the government\u2019s reach an email sent from the Supreme Court building to someone just a block away, if the company had chosen to store it on a server outside the U.S.  Nothing would keep Microsoft \"from storing United States communications, every one of them, either in Canada or Mexico or anywhere else, and then telling their customers: Don\u2019t worry if the government wants to get access to your communications; they won\u2019t be able to,\" without getting help from a from foreign government, Roberts told Microsoft lawyer Joshua Rosenkranz.  Justice Samuel Alito expressed concern that law enforcement would be hobbled without the ability to demand offshore emails from companies located in the U.S.  He asked what happens when a U.S. citizen is being investigated for crimes in this country, and the government has shown it has an \"urgent need\" for \"evidence of this crime in emails that are in the possession of an American internet service provider\" that has stored the emails overseas.  Rosenkranz said U.S. prosecutors would ask for help from that country\u2019s government. \"If it\u2019s urgent for the government, the other governments respond urgently,\" he said.  Microsoft, which is supported in the case by companies including Google, Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., stores email content at more than 100 data centers in more than 40 countries. The company says it uses that many sites for the sake of speed, putting users as close as possible to their data.  Proposal in Congress  The government says that requesting assistance from other countries in gathering evidence can be a slow and difficult process. Fewer than half of the world\u2019s countries have treaties with the U.S. for providing such help.  Several of the Democratic-nominated justices expressed frustration with applying the the decades-old law to the era of cloud computing, suggesting they might prefer to wait for Congress to act on a pending bipartisan proposal to update the law.  Justice Sonia Sotomayor suggested to Deputy U.S. Solicitor General Michael Dreeben that the government\u2019s interpretation of the law would raise conflicts with the data privacy laws of other countries.  \"Why shouldn\u2019t we leave the status quo as it is and let Congress pass a bill in this new age that addresses the potential problems that your reading would create?\" Sotomayor asked, following up on a similar question from Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.  \u2018Break the Cloud\u2019  Rosenkranz, the Microsoft lawyer, told the justices that a ruling could damage the standing of the U.S. as the world leader in the multibillion-dollar cloud computing business.  \"If you try to tinker with this without the tools that -- that only Congress has, you are as likely to break the cloud as you are to fix it,\" he said.  Attending Tuesday\u2019s argument was Republican Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, a cosponsor of the bipartisan measure, which would let the U.S. make formal agreements with other countries for cross-border requests for digital evidence. After the argument, Hatch said in a statement, \"It\u2019s no surprise that throughout this morning\u2019s oral argument, justices continually referred to the importance of action from Congress.\"  The case is United States v.

A timing quirk in the tax overhaul seemed to give companies such as Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Cisco Systems Inc. -- all of which began their fiscal years before Jan. 1 -- the chance to reduce the foreign cash they\u2019ll accumulate this year and lower their taxes. A press release issued by the IRS on Monday indicates that \u201cif done in the ordinary course of business,\u201d the move won\u2019t be considered as tax avoidance, according to Stephen Shay, a tax and business law professor at Harvard Law School.  \u201cThe light is green for this planning, not red,\u201d said Shay, a former top Treasury official. \u201cIt is great for those whose years beginning before 2018 are still open for the planning.\u201d  While companies taking steps to shift their assets would still owe repatriation taxes, they wouldn\u2019t have as much cash taxed at the higher rate -- \"a major concession\" by the IRS, said independent tax and accounting expert Robert Willens.  The tax law signed by President Donald Trump in December overhauled the international tax system and requires companies to pay a mandatory two-tiered levy on their accumulated foreign income. Cash is taxed at 15.5 percent, while less liquid assets face a rate of 8 percent. Companies have been trying to figure out ways to reduce assets subject to the higher rate.  Another provision in the IRS release also allows multinationals some leeway when calculating their repatriation tax bills. The law appeared to make more foreign entities owned by multinationals subject to the repatriation tax, but the agency said Monday that taxpayers that own less than 5 percent of a foreign entity\u2019s capital or profits won\u2019t be hit by the repatriation tax.  \u2018Pro-Taxpayer\u2019 Notice  Banks and financial institutions will also see a reprieve following the IRS\u2019s guidance that a company\u2019s accounts receivable and accounts payable that are longer than one year will be exempt from the repatriation tax, said John Warner, a tax partner at Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney PC. The financial firms had feared the payments under the loans they issue would have faced the 15.5 percent rate, since they\u2019re generally considered accounts receivable, regardless of their maturities.  \"This is generally pro-taxpayer,\" Warner said.  Still, the agency said it would crack down on some strategies multinationals may use to reduce their offshore tax bills, such as artificially reducing their earnings and profits, cash piles or \"pro-rata\" share of transactions, for foreign entities they have stakes in, own or control.  Those rules will be a big deal to some companies, said Michael Mundaca, the co-director of Ernst & Young\u2019s Washington National tax practice and a former top Treasury Department tax official.

Sales of all devices are stagnating, but the time may have arrived for a hybrid gadget.  It seemed like such a good idea, in theory. And it still seems like a good idea -- again, in theory.  Microsoft Corp. and Qualcomm Inc. are pitching computers that mix elements of tablets and smartphones. That means, in principle, people will soon be able to buy a device that works like a familiar Windows laptop but with the slimmer and lighter form of a tablet computer plus the built-in cellular connections and long battery life of a smartphone.  You might be thinking, that sounds similar to an iPad Pro or Microsoft's own line of Surface computers. Yup. And all these gadgets also owe a debt of gratitude to the MacBook Air, the skinny, battery-conserving laptop Apple Inc. introduced a decade ago.  There's a reason I'm curious but cautious about this category of devices that blend elements of PCs, tablets and smartphones. There have been cellular-connected lightweight computers on the market for years, off and on, including devices powered by Microsoft and Qualcomm five years ago. They never caught on. This time, though, these hybrid devices are a category whose time has come. I think.  Powering Down Personal computer sales peaked in 2011 and have declined each year since Source: IDC  Even as smartphones have become the most important digital devices, there has been much welcome innovation in computers. New technology from PC chip king Intel Corp. and Microsoft's 2012 introduction of the Surface spurred fresh ideas about what a \"computer\" could be.  The Surface has a touchscreen like a smartphone and a detachable keyboard that turns the device into a somewhat compromised tablet-laptop hybrid. Microsoft sold more than $2 billion worth of the gadgets in the six months ended Dec. 31, and some traditional PC makers have found traction with these combo machines, too.  The Surface was followed by the iPad Pro, a similar tablet-plus-keyboard with the heart of a smartphone. Google software supports stripped-down laptops called Chromebooks that have been a huge hit in U.S. schools. These are all relatively recent and welcome reimaginations of conventional computers.  They're not perfect for everyone or every use, but the mixed-up world of computers gives people more choices to find the right devices for them. A PC-tablet hybrid with a fast wireless internet connection is a welcome addition to that stew of options, although there are unanswered questions about the performance and drawbacks of the new machines backed by Microsoft and Qualcomm.  It's also an odd time to be devoting resources to any new type of computer hardware. Global sales of personal computers have dropped for each of the past six years, according to research firm IDC. The research firm's PC data don't include devices like the Surface that have detachable keyboards. Tablet sales are also declining, and smartphone sales have hit a wall. It's not halcyon days for most companies that make computing gadgets.  Hardware Hits a Wall Global sales of computers, tablets and smartphones all declined in 2017. Change in unit shipments from the prior year: Source: IDC  Still, you can see the appeal of trying new concepts in computing. Even if PCs and tablets aren't growth categories, more than 400 million of these gadgets are still sold each year. And each player in the market has its own motivations. Qualcomm, for example, sees greenfield opportunity if it can displace Intel in more PC-type devices.  The big question now is how much of a push the latest cellular-connected PCs will get from their backers. There\u2019s a lot of enthusiasm for the next generation of cellular technology called 5G, which optimists say will usher in a new era of internet-connected devices of all kinds. Intel said on Thursday that it is also collaborating with Microsoft and others to introduce a line of 5G-connected computing devices. The backing of Microsoft, Qualcomm and Intel should bolster the idea of blending smartphones, tablets and computers.

Now, that group is bearing its first fruit: Microsoft Genomics, a gene-sequencing service developed with St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.  Microsoft Healthcare NExT head Dr. Peter Lee says the challenges are hard, but there are lots of benefits, tangible and otherwise, to this healthcare push.  A year ago, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella tasked Microsoft Research NExT \u2014 the company's A-team of troubleshooting scientists \u2014 with a new mission: Take the company's most cutting-edge tech and apply it to improving healthcare.  Microsoft Healthcare NExT head and corporate VP Dr. Peter Lee tells Business Insider that this new mandate was so broad, it was a little bit like being dropped in the middle of the ocean and told to find dry land.  \"There's no sign of which way is the right way, and you could swim really far in any one direction before realizing you were going astray.\" And, of course, he says, healthcare is a field that many tech companies have tried to tackle, and failed. You might think you're making progress, but \"then you look down and see the people drowning.\"  \"There was a time where we were just floundering,\" Lee says.  Now, though, Lee feels like Microsoft's efforts have finally begun to bear fruit, in the form of real, actual products that are making a difference to healthcare organizations, hospitals \u2014 and patients' lives.  For instance, on Wednesday, Microsoft announced the general availability of Microsoft Genomics, a gene-sequencing service available to doctors and researchers via the Microsoft Azure cloud platform. That platform was born directly out of joint research between Microsoft and St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.  Microsoft researchers discuss Microsoft Genomics, the company's new gene-sequencing tool, powered by the Microsoft Azure cloud. Microsoft  \"We already got one product out of this push,\" says Lee.  Similarly, Microsoft is announcing the availability and expansion of other partnership-driven services. Microsoft and India's Apollo Hospitals teamed up for a new artificially-intelligent system for detecting tell-tale signs of heart disease in patient data, for instance; it also partnered up with UPMC for Project Empower MD, a note-taking tool for doctors.  Lee says it's been extremely rewarding: The biggest motivator for his team is getting to make a difference in people's lives. Plus, Healthcare NExT gets to work with cutting-edge technology, like Microsoft's partnership with Seattle-based Adaptive Biotechnologies, which is attempting to use AI to detect cancers and other serious maladies with a simple blood test.  \"It's just cool beyond belief,\" says Lee of Adaptive.  Lee says there are more material rewards, too, as these products open new markets for Microsoft \u2014 important, as some analysts estimate that healthcare cloud computing could be a $35 billion market by 2020.  Doctors, surgeons, and researchers have long needed these kinds of tools, says Lee, and Microsoft is happy to deliver. He says healthcare is becoming a \"very large business\" for Microsoft.  \"We don't talk publicly about the dollars, but it's large,\" says Lee.  Not drowning yet  The key that helped Microsoft Healthcare NExT find its way was to take a bigger-picture approach, says Lee. The starting point was to look at the so-called \"hyperscale\" clouds from Microsoft, Amazon, and Google, and try to picture what the world would be like without them.  With that in mind, Lee says, Microsoft started making bets. The Microsoft NExT \"standard playbook\" revolves around forming individual, internal \"startups\" with their own funding and purpose-driven mandates, so the engineers and scientists on the team got organized and got moving.  Some of those self-styled \"startups\" started using the Microsoft Azure cloud to provide gene-sequencing supercomputing power, resulting in the service now known as Microsoft Genomics. Others focused on neonatal care, or better software for doctors, or improved ways to take patient measurements.  St. Jude researchers use Microsoft Genomics. St. Jude Children's Research Hospital  In all cases, Lee says, the key was for Microsoft to work closely with patients \u2014 as they did with St. Jude for Microsoft Genomics.  \"We appreciate that Microsoft is investing in genomic research and that they took the time to understand and appreciate our unique mission at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital: finding cures and saving children,\" St. Jude CIO Keith Perry told Business Insider via e-mail.  And for his part, Lee says the team has found a lot of \"inspiration\" in working directly with healthcare providers, and the patients they service. In working on Microsoft Genomics, he says, he and his team have made several pediatric cancer patients \u2014 renewing their drive to do better, faster. He says it's \"incredibly motivating.\"  Which is good, because he says Microsoft has \"found its way forward.\" There's no more floundering, he says, just promising movement in the right direction. For instance, Lee's group is now working on an intelligent chatbot for pharmacies that can help patients reorder prescriptions and answer questions about their medications.  As for himself, Lee describes himself as a \"second-year grad student\" \u2014 he's accumulated enough knowledge in the healthcare space to understand what the experts on his team are talking about and make decisions, but not enough to weigh in and participate in the research himself.  Still, he says, he's learning fast. And if he hasn't quite found dry land, he says he's beyond just treading water.  \"I haven't drowned yet,\" says Lee.", "stock": "MSFT", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-28", "source": "business-insider", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/peter-lee-microsoft-research-healthcare-next-interview-2018-2"}, {"article": "FILE PHOTO - A Microsoft logo is seen a day after Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) $26.2 billion purchase of LinkedIn Corp (LNKD.N), in Los Angeles Thomson Reuters By Dan Levine and Salvador Rodriguez  SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A senior executive said Microsoft Corp thoroughly investigates issues raised by women in the workplace and fired about 20 employees last year over complaints of sexual harassment as the company seeks to counter claims that it treats female workers unfairly.  In an email to employees publicly released late on Thursday, Microsoft Chief People Officer Kathleen Hogan said Microsoft had 83 harassment complaints in 2017 out of a U.S.-based workforce of over 65,000 employees.  Nearly 50 percent were found to be supported at least in part following an investigation, she said, and more than half of those resulted in the termination of an employee who engaged in unacceptable behavior.  The unusual publication of such data comes as the world's largest software company is defending a lawsuit which alleges it systematically denied pay raises or promotions to women. Microsoft denies it has ever had such a policy.  The lawsuit, filed in Seattle federal court in 2015, is attracting wider attention after a series of powerful men have left or been fired from their jobs in entertainment, the media and politics for sexual misconduct.  Microsoft also investigated 84 complaints of gender discrimination last year, Hogan said, and found around 10 percent of those to be supported at least in part.  Earlier this week, Reuters reported on the contents of unsealed court documents which showed that out of 118 gender discrimination complaints filed by women in U.S.-based technical jobs at Microsoft between 2010 and 2016, only one was deemed \"founded\" by the company.  Attorneys for the women described the number of complaints as \"shocking\" in the court filings, and said the response by Microsoft's investigations team was \"lackluster.\"  Hogan's email on Thursday linked to the Reuters story and said the numbers cited by plaintiffs were misleading.  \"Reports that we rarely reach a conclusion in favor of the complainant are based on a faulty reading of a partial data set,\" Hogan wrote.  Hogan's email did not provide additional figures about the time period cited in the court documents.  The plaintiffs based their numbers on documents disclosed by Microsoft during pre-trial discovery in the lawsuit. Kelly Dermody, an attorney for the plaintiffs, declined to comment on Hogan's email.  Alaina Percival, chief executive of Women Who Code, an organization that helps companies increase their number of women developers, said publicly releasing this kind of data can help businesses learn from each other about the best ways to handle sexual harassment and gender discrimination.  \"I think other tech companies should follow suit, and I would expect to see that happen,\" Percival said.

Booty's job will be to execute Spencer's strategy within the six studios, as part of a company-wide effort to juice up its global gaming strength.  Microsoft has named Matt Booty the new corporate VP of Microsoft Studios, the division that incorporates Xbox and all of its gaming efforts.  As VentureBeat first reported, Booty was one of the key people in Microsoft's \"Minecraft\" business, and his promotion is crucial to the company's overall gaming strategy and ambition.  Back in September, CEO Satya Nadella appointed previous Microsoft Studios VP Phil Spencer as an executive VP in the company's top board, alongside the people overseeing Windows 10, the Surface brand, the Office 365 suite, and more.  This move had left the position vacant, and Booty is now stepping up to fill in.

The figure was cited by plaintiffs suing Microsoft for systematically denying pay raises or promotions to women at the world's largest software company. Microsoft denies it had any such policy.  The lawsuit, filed in Seattle federal court in 2015, is attracting wider attention after a series of powerful men have left or been fired from their jobs in entertainment, the media and politics for sexual misconduct.  Plaintiffs' attorneys are pushing to proceed as a class action lawsuit, which could cover more than 8,000 women. More details about Microsoft's human resources practices were made public on Monday in legal filings submitted as part of that process.  The two sides are exchanging documents ahead of trial, which has not been scheduled.  Out of 118 gender discrimination complaints filed by women at Microsoft, only one was deemed \"founded\" by the company, according to details in the unsealed court filings.  Attorneys for the women called the number of complaints \"shocking\" in the court filings and the response by Microsoft's investigations team \"lackluster.\"  Companies generally keep information about internal discrimination complaints private, so it is unclear how the number of complaints at Microsoft compares to competitors.  Microsoft said in court filings that the plaintiffs did not identify practices that impact enough employees to warrant a class action, and that it spends more than $55 million per year to promote diversity and inclusion. The company had about 74,000 U.S. employees at the end of last year.  Microsoft said the plaintiffs cannot cite one example of a pay or promotion problem in which Microsoft's investigations team should have found a violation of company policy, but did not. A Microsoft spokesperson could not immediately be reached for comment.  U.S. District Judge James Robart has not yet ruled on the plaintiffs' request for class action status.  A Reuters review of federal court cases filed between 2006 and 2016 revealed hundreds containing sexual harassment allegations where companies used common civil litigation tactics to keep potentially damning information under wraps.  Microsoft had argued that the number of womens' human resources complaints should be kept secret because publicizing the outcomes could deter employees from reporting future abuses.

On Monday, a court issued a temporary restraining order which prevents McIntyre from working at Microsoft until further notice.  Using Microsoft's own arguments from a previous lawsuit, IBM is arguing that its diversity strategy is both confidential and \"potentially damaging\" if shared with its competitors.  Tech companies have a less than stellar record hiring women and minorities. But these companies will apparently do whatever it takes \u2014 including launching a legal fight \u2014 to hire one type of person: a Chief Diversity Officer.  IBM is suing its former top diversity officer Lindsay-Rae McIntyre after she got poached by Microsoft, in a case that could prove just how important diversity, recruitment, and retention has become for tech companies.  McIntyre, who joined IBM in 2006, was named chief diversity officer of Microsoft on Sunday, after serving in the same role and as VP of human resources at IBM. IBM, in its complaint, argues that McIntyree had access to diversity data, strategies, methodologies and initiatives that are confidential, and that she \"will use, rely on or divulge\" these strategies in her new role.  On Monday, IBM was granted a temporary restraining order in New York federal court, which prevents McIntyre from working for Microsoft until the court decides otherwise.  \"McIntyre was at the center of highly confidential and competitively sensitive information that has fueled IBM's success in these areas,\" a representative for IBM said in a statement. \"While we understand Microsoft's need to deal with mounting criticism of its record on diversity, IBM intends to fully enforce Ms. McIntyre's non-compete agreement to protect our competitive information.\"  IBM is using another Microsoft lawsuit to argue its case  At the heart of IBM's complaint is an on-going lawsuit from 2015, Moussouris v. Microsoft Corporation. The lawsuit alleges that Microsoft systematically discriminated against women in technical and engineering roles at the company when it came to evaluations, pay, and promotions.  The briefings for that lawsuit wrapped up on February 9. Now it is up to the courts to decide whether or not the case has class-action status.  As part of its non-compete case, IBM is looking to use Microsoft's own legal arguments from the Moussouris lawsuit to make its own point.  In April 2017, to prevent certain information from being released publicly in the discovery process, Microsoft argued that such diversity data is \"not merely confidential, but so sensitive and potentially damaging to Microsoft if revealed to its competitors (e.g., IBM), that the court should take the extraordinary measure of putting the information under seal,\" according to IBM's complaint.  Microsoft ultimately got some of the documents in the case sealed, and others released with redactions.  In its official response to IBM, Microsoft argued that enforcing McIntyre's non-compete agreement is \"draconian,\" as McIntyre has promised not to share confidential information with Microsoft.  It's worth noting that IBM's employee ranks are not a paragon of diversity: According to IBM's website, women comprised 31.8% of its global workforce in 2016.", "stock": "MSFT", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-12", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-hired-chief-diversity-officer-ibm-suing-2018-2"}, {"article": ".

As \"deal-maker-in-chief,\" Peggy Johnson gets paid millions to help make Microsoft billions.  Her actual title is executive vice president for business development, and she's helped lead over 40 investments with Microsoft Ventures. One deal was the acquisition of LinkedIn \u2014 for $26 billion.  \"It takes an army for sure,\" Johnson said on Business Insider's podcast, \"Success!

Microsoft's Peggy Johnson, right, spoke with Business Insider US Editor-in-Chief Alyson Shontell at the World Economic Forum, in Davos, Switzerland, in January 2018. Business Insider  To understand Peggy Johnson and the qualities that have made her successful, you have to know about her family. She was the 14th of 15 kids. As a child she was a quiet listener who learned to read her siblings' facial expressions from the kitchen countertop (with so many people, her chair wouldn't fit around the family table). Eventually Johnson followed some of her brothers and sisters to San Diego State University, where she started studying business, even though she really loved math and science. It was there that a chance encounter changed her life's trajectory.  Peggy Johnson: My parents had two rules: You had to go to college, and you had to pay for it yourself. So we all did. I was delivering mail and happened to deliver mail to the engineering department one day. Two ladies at the end of this long hallway with linoleum floors could hear me coming, and they were super excited to see me \u2014 like more excited than they should've been just because I was delivering mail.  It was because they thought I was there to ask about engineering. And they were disappointed. They said, \"We thought you wanted to know something about the School of Engineering.\" I said, \"Nope \u2014 just delivering the mail.\" They said, \"Well, do you know anything about engineering?,\" and I said, \"You know, absolutely nothing.\"  No one had ever really talked to me about engineering, and so they asked me the same question, \"Do you like math and science?\" I said, \"I love it.\" They just started to work on me, and after 15 to 20 minutes I felt, like, \"You know, this might be something I want to do.\"  The next day I changed my major to engineering \u2014 yeah, to electrical engineering.  Alyson Shontell: Wow.  Johnson: I credit those two ladies. They just, you know, worked on me and changed my mind.  Shontell: They changed your life.  Johnson: My life. The whole trajectory of my life really changed in that conversation.  Shontell: So you wound up getting a job at GE after this great electrical-engineering major. And you spent a couple years there.  Johnson: Yeah, I started as an intern while I was still at school, and again, San Diego State put me on a great course because they had a number of great internship opportunities, and this area of General Electric was in their military electronics division. I worked on anti-submarine warfare for surface ships. So it sounds very interesting, I'm sure. You want to know more about that, but I can't say anything because I had a clearance.  But it was a job I might still be in today if not for it seemed like it was going to move to Syracuse, New York, and of course I was in San Diego, California, but I didn't want to move, and well, \"I've got to look for a job here in San Diego,\" and ended up saying no to GE.  Johnson spent 25 years working her way up the ladder  Johnson worked at Qualcomm for 25 years on both the technical engineering side and the business side. Thomson Reuters  Shontell: Is that when you went to Qualcomm?  Johnson: Yes, and I just answered an ad in the newspaper, which they don't do anymore. You probably never even heard of that, but yes, that's how you used to get jobs, look through the newspaper.  Shontell: In the classifieds.  Johnson: The classifieds, and there it was. It was this new company, and they were hiring, and my husband had had an internship at the predecessor to Qualcomm, called Linkabit. He said, \"You know, Irwin Jacobs is an amazing man.\" He had owned and been in Linkabit, and he said, \"I don't know what Qualcomm does, but I think you should \u2014 \"  Shontell: He's the founder of Qualcomm?  Johnson: Irwin Jacobs is, yeah. And so prodded by my husband, who was at that time pursuing his master's degree, and we were married, and one of us needed to work, and that was me. So I went in, had an interview. Hardest interview of my life, and ended up getting the job, and stayed there for 25 years.  Shontell: Yeah, it's incredible. But while you had a long career there, at first it seemed as if you were soft-spoken and it was hard to kind of get your point across in a loud room with those guys.  Johnson: It was.  And I'm soft-spoken probably going back to the family experience. Number 14 out of 15 wasn't an enviable position to be in. You were just one of so many voices at the table, and I was one who had to sit at the side table. So I was at the kids' table until I was, like, 24 years old.  So I was more of a listener, and I was quiet largely because I couldn't ever really break in to that chaos at the big table. But I was a listener and I would watch people, and I would try to understand their mood. Those skills were what I brought into my job at Qualcomm, and maybe not great skills, because when I got to Qualcomm the expectation really at that time was, \"You need to speak up more. You need to be more assertive in meetings. We want to hear from you more.\" Whenever I did that, whenever I tried to be what I wasn't, it didn't really turn out very well, and I didn't feel very authentic, and in fact people would kind of look at me \u2014 \"Why is she being so assertive and aggressive here? That's not like her.\" And it wasn't. It wasn't my authentic self.  So pretty much I had decided, \"I think I have to leave the industry, the company. I'm just not suited for this.\" My manager at the time said, \"No, we are going to figure this out. You're going to stay right where you are,\" and really I credit him for making a lot of changes in the HR department at the time because we were ranked by certain attributes that I didn't have. So I remember being marked off for not being aggressive and assertive in meetings, and he said, \"We are going to change this, and we are going to make sure we have a broader set of qualities that we're looking for.\" Things like teamwork and being collaborative, and he really pushed. It was early, early days, and things changed from that point on. Once I was able to be my more authentic self I felt like that's when my career really took off. I was just my own voice.  Shontell: Yes, so he sort of gave you permission to be yourself and helped you find your own leadership style.  Johnson: He did, yes. I always credit him for that because I might have just left like, I think, a lot of women did at the time. They just didn't feel comfortable and it didn't feel like a very inclusive environment, and he helped change that.  Shontell: So you go on to stay for many, many more years at Qualcomm \u2014 25 years.  Johnson: Yes.  Shontell: What made you so dedicated to that one company?  Johnson: Right, yes. So first of all, Qualcomm's a great company, and they gave me the opportunity to really thrive in a number of roles. So I was an engineer to start with, and I was in the engineering department for several years. Then I had been going out on business trips because we needed to explain the product to the industry we were selling into, and on one of the flights home the general manager happens to be sitting next to me and he said, \"I don't understand. Why don't you just come over to the business side? You really seem to love doing that, and I like the way you translate the technical world into the business world. I think you could be well suited for that.\"  And I thought, \"Well, thank you very much but no, thank you. I'm an engineer.\" I identified with being an engineer, and I remember thinking engineering at that time at Qualcomm was in one building, and all the business people were in the other building, and we made fun of them all the time because they dressed up, and we got to wear our Qualcomm shirts and jeans. We thought we didn't want to have anything to do with that world, but it started to weigh on me, and probably four or five weeks went by, and I remember sitting at our holiday party, and all of sudden I had one of those aha moments, and it was:\" \"You need to do this. You need to make that leap.\" Because while I liked what I did, I loved being in front of the customer. So I did, and I moved over into program management, which is sort of a technical and business role, and that was really the start of my business career at Qualcomm.  Shontell: So you switched from engineering to the business-development side, and that's when things really took off.  Johnson: Yeah, and I think part of it was the time. It was early days of the mobile phones. We were making the digital standard that was eventually embedded into mobile phones in the US, and so everything was exciting and new. We were forging new paths, and it was such a great time to be at the start of a business. None of us had any idea what it would turn into. I don't think any of us at that time envisioned that everybody would be carrying cellphones. I mean, we thought, \"That'll be a good business. Maybe a few million of those will sell.\" So it was fun to be there at the start of that, but I had great managers along the way, and any time I wanted to do something different they really supported me.  Shontell: And switching careers isn't easy. I mean, it's a big risk.  Johnson: Exactly. It is, and you're not quite sure, and if it doesn't work out, can I go back? Once I switched over I had to learn a lot. Clearly I didn't have a business degree, and a lot of it was on-the-job learning, but I had some great mentors and folks who leaned in and helped me. And I just loved every hat I wore after that point, until I moved on to Microsoft from Qualcomm.  How Johnson decided to make the leap and start a new career at Microsoft  Johnson was recruited by Satya Nadella as his first big hire after becoming Microsoft's CEO in 2014. Microsoft  Shontell: It sounds like you had a great setup. You established yourself through the ranks, had great mentorship. So Microsoft calls. You'd been rejecting other calls before, kind of just hanging up the phone on recruiters. What was it about Microsoft?  Johnson: Well, I wouldn't call them back. I wouldn't hang up on them.  Shontell: OK: You were polite about it.  Johnson: That's it. But it was one of those interesting times. I hadn't ever called any back because everything was great at Qualcomm. I loved it, and also I was living in San Diego, my family was there. Everything was fantastic, but at the time of the industry Satya had just taken over, Satya Nadella, as CEO of Microsoft. We did business with Microsoft. We sold them chips, and so we know, of course, of Microsoft. We didn't really know Satya, and one of the first things he did is he decided to put Office on IOS and Android phones, and that blew us away. I mean, probably not just us in Qualcomm, but the industry.  That was quite a bold move, and so when I got the call from Microsoft they said, \"Well, it's a job reporting to Satya. You'd be running business development.\" I thought, \"I just want to call back to understand what it's about. The company seems to be in this big transition, and I just want to learn a little bit basically.\" But of course was never going to go anywhere. I lived in San Diego there wasn't any question that I was going anywhere. When I called back I was just drawn in, and eventually I had a conversation with Satya.  Shontell: He called you on a Saturday.  Johnson: He did, yeah. He did, and so I was chatting with him, and again it was kind of like another aha moment. He was talking about his world view of a mobile-first, cloud-first world, and all of a sudden it just connected with me because obviously I'd been living in a mobile-first world, a wireless world. That was what I knew inside and out. I felt very comfortable in that world. Then when data left the phone it went off to that thing called the cloud and Qualcomm didn't have much to do with that. As he was talking about this idea of ambient computing and having intelligence everywhere it just clicked with me that this is something I need to know more about, and I wanted to understand more about Satya's vision, and eventually took a trip to Seattle.  I remember getting on the plane in San Diego feeling like, \"I hope nobody sees me because I've never done this before. I'm gonna go visit another company for a job possibly.\" And had a chance to meet the rest of the management team, and then to sit down with Satya. His vision to empower every person and organization on the planet, to achieve more, it just struck me, and it resonated with me, and I ended up saying yes, making the move with my family. We had only one child at home at that time, and so we moved up to Seattle, where I live today.  Shontell: He's done incredible things with Microsoft.  Johnson: He has, absolutely.  Shontell: What's he like to work with?  Johnson: Very empathetic. He's a listener. He's a learner. Curious. We're allowed to fail, learn from it, but it's super important. He's really changed the company at its core, and we are following a growth mindset, which he introduced to the company, and I feel like whenever we sort of get off path a little bit, we come back to the growth mindset. We'll say, \"Are we exhibiting a growth mindset here?\" You know? It's easy to say no. Any idea you can have 10 nos. It's a lot harder to say yes. So the growth mindset allows us to push boarders a little bit, and to say yes more, try things out, fail fast. I believe it's changed the core of the company, and I hear that from others outside, which is very gratifying. But what's so exciting is that the campus is energized, and it's just been a wild, crazy, fun ride for the last three years.  What it takes to be Microsoft's deal-maker-in-chief  As executive vice president for business development, Johnson has overseen more than 40 investments, including the $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn. REUTERS/Robert Galbraith  Shontell: So it's been three years. You've done a lot. One thing that stands out: You worked with a big team on the LinkedIn deal. Microsoft bought LinkedIn for $26 billion-plus.  Johnson: Yeah: $26 billion.  Shontell: So how does a $26 billion deal happen? How long did it take? What happens behind the scenes? Because most of us don't get to that level.  Johnson: It takes an army, for sure. I mean, I would say the evolution of an acquisition that big has to go through many, many gates, and it starts with sort of conversations. It starts with a strategy. \"Are we the better owners?\" Looking at it from all different angles.  Clearly, one of that size needs to be assessed fully, and we have fantastic teams across the company who are so good at that assessment. Also, the engagement, once we decided to make the decision to go forward, the engagement with the company, the integration part, which is super important. You can make all of the great strategic assessments ahead of time, but if you can't integrate well after, you've lost a lot of money. The teams at Microsoft are just first class at that.  Shontell: So is it a 10-month process? Faster?  Johnson: I can't remember. There were conversations for a long period of time, but then once we sort of pulled the trigger, I want to say \u2014 I don't know \u2014 maybe it was somewhere between six and 12 months. I can't quite remember from the time of the first conversations until we announced that we were going to proceed with an acquisition.  Shontell: When I saw the headline, and we were writing it on Business Insider, it was like, \"Oh, whoa. This is a huge deal.\" It went totally under the radar. You didn't get scooped.  Johnson: Another thing that I think we did a very good job on ... because obviously a team that size inside the company did a very good job of keeping things quiet on both sides. Including the transactional folks in between. So all of that had rolled out very, very well. It was sort of the example of how you'd like to do an acquisition.  Shontell: I'm sure you say no, of course, much more than you say yes. One that stands out is Slack, I think, was an opportunity to buy, and I think Microsoft ultimately passed, along with some others. On a deal like that, how do you weigh it?  Johnson: Well, without commenting specifically on Slack, I would say for any acquisition we ask that question, \"Are we the better owners? Does it fulfill a strategic gap that we have?\" Because many times a partnership is even better oftentimes because to be an owner you have to be all in, but if a partnership can work to fill a gap, we'll go that route. Sometimes we'll make an investment in a company because they're on a quicker path to filling a gap, but they may need a little help in the form of resources to get there. Then finally if the right answer is, \"Yes, we are the better owners,\" we'll go the full way and go forward with an acquisition.  So we do sort of an assessment that way, and we try to be very, very disciplined, and stick to our core ambitions, and not go too far off of that, because that's where you get into trouble. So we talk ourselves in and out of things often.  Johnson explains how to be a good leader  Johnson learned a lot of leadership skills growing up in a family with 15 children. Microsoft  Shontell: You've said that prioritization is a skill that you learned really early on. Do you have tips? How do you figure out, in a job as huge as yours \u2014 I'm sure you have a million different things that you could be doing \u2014 how do you focus, and how do you zero in on the right things?  Johnson: Well, I think I learned it from my mom, who is probably the program-manager-in-chief to run a house like that. Because one of the things she used to say is, \"We may have 15 kids, but we're not gonna be a messy house. When people come in the house we don't want them to say, 'Oh yeah, this is what I thought a house with 15 kids would look like.'\" So she was very disciplined. She made lists \u2014 and I love lists \u2014 and checking things off the list always feels good.  So I learned sort of that prioritization from my mom, and that it's not important to get everything on the list done but really to make sure that you set out in the morning to get the top ones done. That's what your focus should be. You shouldn't be stressed that you didn't get to the bottom of the list. She was very good at that.  Shontell: Another skill of yours is you're great, from what I've heard your coworkers say, you're great at building these relationships that last a long time. Especially in that business \u2014 it's so critical to have that. How do you do that? What are your tips for building long-lasting work and general life relationships?  Johnson: I think it goes back to that family table when I was the listener in the room, and that is something that is probably a little bit underrated, but for me has been, I feel like, the core of my leadership abilities is the ability to listen, and to deeply listen, and to understand and put myself in the other person's shoes. Once you do that you can solve whatever problem there is on the table whether it's a business problem or a technical problem, I think, more quickly having that ability to put yourself on the other side.  Shontell: Then I have a kind of more general landscape question. I think someone asked you once what you thought the biggest issue women face in the workforce is, and you said harassment. Certainly we've seen a lot of stories about that this year, Harvey Weinstein on up. What do you think we can do better? How do you think we can fix it? What have you seen that makes you say that?  Johnson: Well, I just feel like you should be able to have a respectful work environment, because if you do you'll be your best self. You'll bring your best self to work, and over the years there was always that whispering at work when there was people you avoided because you didn't want a comment about your dress or something, and I think about all of the cycles that my friends and I would share, you know, \"Don't go by that person's office. Go the long way around.\" Those cycles could have been put to a lot better use. So there's kind of a business reason to stop this, and there's obviously all of the other reasons that we've been talking about since the #MeToo movement started, but there's also a basic business reason. We could be so much more productive if we didn't have to spend all those cycles sort of fending off that sometimes subtle harassment, but it sort of exists there, and if we can together say, \"Let's just have an inclusive, respectful environment at work,\" and teach our boys and our girls, I think we'll be far more productive. We'll be our best selves. We'll bring our best selves to work because we'll know we'll be in a comfortable environment.  Shontell: You've had an incredible career, many years ahead of it still, but the point that you've gotten to is just really inspiring. If you're looking back or you're giving someone advice who's just starting their career, what do you wish you had known then, and what would you advise someone who wants to rise to the top like you have?  Johnson: Well, I think the best advice I ever got was just to be myself, and I think once I settled into who I am, I'm quiet, I'm somewhat introverted, and decided that's OK, it's OK to be who I am. Then my career took off. So for someone starting I would say, \"Be who you are. If you are aggressive and assertive that's fine, too. Just embrace who you are because we really need that diversity of thought at work. We don't need a bunch of Peggy Johnsons of any one type. We really need the sort of the mix and the blend of all the different opinions and voices.\" That I think would be good advice for someone just stepping into their career.  Shontell: Thank you so much, Peggy. It's really been fun.  Johnson: Thank you, Alyson. Thanks for having me. I appreciate it.", "stock": "MSFT", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-02", "source": "business-insider", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/peggy-johnson-microsoft-linkedin-interview-2018-2"}, {"article": "A Microsoft logo is seen in Los Angeles Thomson Reuters By Salvador Rodriguez  SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp on Monday said 200,000 organizations are now using Teams, its year-old workplace collaboration software, up from 125,000 in September, a sign the company may be making some progress in its battle with Slack Technologies Inc.  Microsoft also announced a slate of new features for Teams, including instant language translation.  Slack's emergence as a popular platform for workplace messaging and document-sharing is a threat to Microsoft's long-standing dominance in office productivity software.  Teams now comes bundled with Microsoft Office 365 as the company battles rival offerings from companies including privately-held Slack, Alphabet Inc's Google , Atlassian Corp PLC , Cisco Systems Inc and Facebook Inc .  \"These group messaging tools go far beyond just chat and are becoming a central hub for integrating a variety of business applications into a single user interface,\" said Alan Lepofsky, analyst with Constellation Research. \"They are essentially the new inbox.\"  Microsoft has raced to make Teams a viable competitor after realizing several years ago that Slack was making inroads with big customers. A former Microsoft Office executive told Reuters that learning of the widespread adoption of Slack at Walt Disney Co in early 2015 was an especially important wake-up call.  \"It's one thing when an app gains traction with startups in Silicon Valley, that happens all the time,\" said the former employee, who asked not to be named. \"But it's another when your biggest, longest-tenured customers start adopting it, and then you realize you have to respond.\"  San Francisco-based Slack said in September that it had 6 million daily users and more than 50,000 paying teams. It has not published new figures since then.  Microsoft has not released comparable figures for Teams.  Slack has a big lead when it comes to third-party applications, with more than 1,000 compared to 250 for Teams.  Teams is still not as simple to use as Slack and lacks the depth of functionality, said Wayne Kurtzman, an analyst with the research firm IDC.  \"As great as Microsoft Teams has done in the past year, it's still not as mature of a product,\" Kurtzman said.  Microsoft says it is gaining ground, pointing to customers such as Navistar, the manufacturer of trucks and buses. Navistar moved about a thousand employees onto Teams last year, choosing it over Slack due to its long-time relationship with Microsoft, said Terry Kline, Navistar chief information officer.  \"We looked at Slack, and we didn't see any significant advantage,\" Kline told Reuters in a phone interview.  The move has reduced the company's use of email by 3 percent, he added.  Other Teams customers include Macy's, General Motors, General Electric, ConocoPhillips and Nascar, according to Microsoft.  \"It's surprised all of us how extremely well it's doing,\" Microsoft Teams General Manager Lori Wright told Reuters.

Microsoft has been losing ground to other cloud computing and enterprise software-as-a-service competitors, namely Amazon, but the company could leverage LinkedIn and similarly aggressive acquisitions to kick the unit into high gear, one analyst says.  \"Given that we believe Microsoft feels emboldened with the success of LinkedIn, we think such a renewed focus on SaaS applications could include M&A,\" BMO Capital Markets analyst Keith Bachman said in a note to clients Thursday. \"One area that we think could be a new growth opportunity within the SaaS market is in HCM, or talent management in particular, which would further leverage LinkedIn.\"  Microsoft purchased LinkedIn for $26.2 billion in June 2016.

Microsoft  While Microsoft dominates the global market for classroom PCs, Google Chrome OS rules the roost in the United States.  Microsoft is teaming up with partners including Lenovo to bring a new line of cheap, sub-$300 PCs to market, to take on Google's low-cost Chromebooks.  Microsoft says that a Windows PC is more capable than a Chromebook \u2014 Windows 10 lets you run software like Minecraft or the full version of Microsoft Office.  Minecraft is getting a new chemistry module for students.  Google has all but captured the market for American classrooms \u2014 analyst firm Futuresource estimates that in the third quarter of 2017, Google's low-cost Chromebooks accounted for 59.8% of the laptop market for K-12 education, compared to Microsoft Windows devices' 22.3% share.  But Microsoft would be quick to remind you that this doesn't tell the whole story: That 22.3% share is up from 18.4% the quarter before, and Microsoft says, up 4% from the same period in 2016. And, worldwide, Windows still reigns supreme: In that same third quarter of 2017, Windows accounted for 66.5% of global K-12 classroom PC shipments.  Now, Microsoft is striking back against Google's domestic dominance, with a series of announcements designed to make Windows PCs, Microsoft Office 365, and even the Minecraft video game sensation more appealing for education customers at home and abroad.  Chief among those announcements: New laptops for the classroom, priced between $189 and $299, manufactured by partners Lenovo and JP. These laptops will run Windows 10 S, a version of the operating system streamlined for better battery life and performance \u2014 at the big tradeoff of only being able to install apps from the Microsoft Store.  Microsoft Corporate VP Yusuf Mehdi tells Business Insider that Microsoft is trying to undercut the price advantage of Chromebooks, which often sell for under $299. But because these PCs can run the full versions of Windows software, including Microsoft Office and Minecraft, they offer \"none of the compromises of a Chromebook.\"  Mehdi gives Google credit where he believes credit is due: He says that Chromebooks didn't actually steal any marketshare away from Microsoft, per se; Google just discovered a previously-unmet demand for low-priced laptops and \"made it affordable to have a computer in the classroom.\" And although Apple has had a strong business in schools, but its products are much more expensive.  A new Chemistry Module for Minecraft: Education Edition will let students play around with both atoms and chemical compounds, in the safety of the virtual world. Microsoft  Now, says Mehdi, the burden is on Microsoft to go out and prove that a Windows machine is more capable than a Chromebook of the same price. Many of the low-cost Windows devices announced on Monday will boast touchscreens and stylus support. Some, will even be compatible with certain virtual reality headsets, a feature schools love, Mehdi adds.  Beyond the hardware, Mehdi highlights updates to the software in the Office 365 for Education suite. For instance, the Microsoft Teams chat tool is getting an iOS and Android app for education users. And Minecraft: Education Edition, which is already widely used to teach programming, is getting a chemistry module for students to perform science experiments in the safety of the virtual world.  According to Futuresource, the time could be right for Microsoft, too: Many schools bought their Chromebooks for students in 2014 and 2015, meaning that they could be looking to do a wide-scale replacement in 2018. That's an opportunity for Microsoft to convince them to switch to Windows \u2014 an opportunity he says the company doesn't intend to squander.  \"We finally feel like we have a strong value proposition,\" says Mehdi.", "stock": "MSFT", "label": 1, "date": "2018-01-22", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-windows-10-versus-google-chromebooks-in-classroom-2018-1"}, {"article": "AP  Microsoft is going after Google, Box, and Dropbox customers with a new offer for its OneDrive for Business cloud storage service.  If your business is already using cloud storage from one of those three companies, Microsoft will give you OneDrive for free for the duration of your contract with them.  The fine print: Your company needs to have more than 500 users, and you can't already be a customer of OneDrive or the Office 365 cloud productivity suite.  Google, Box, and Dropbox, be warned: Microsoft is coming for your customers.  On Tuesday, Microsoft announced a new offer to entice companies to use its OneDrive cloud storage service. If you're a business that's already using any of those three competitors, Microsoft will give you its OneDrive for Business service for free until your contract with the other company ends.  The promotional offer comes with some caveats: You have to commit to 500 seats or more, meaning small businesses won't really be able to take advantage. You have to not already be a customer of OneDrive, or of the Microsoft Office 365 productivity suite. And the deal is only good through June 18th.  The big idea is to give customers a taste of what Microsoft can offer, without having to worry about their existing commitments to those other vendors. Microsoft is confident enough that those big customers will sign on, it seems, that they're willing to swallow the cost. In general, Microsoft is seeing solid growth in its subscription cloud businesses, bolstering its confidence here.  As for why customers would want to make the change: Microsoft is touting the deep integrations between its own OneDrive service and Microsoft Office. While Microsoft Office is compatible with cloud storage from those other companies to a certain degree, there are some special features that Microsoft reserves for its own offerings.  For instance, you need OneDrive if you want to have multiple authors simultaneously work on a single Office document in real-time from the computer or smartphone apps. And OneDrive integrates with other Microsoft apps like the team portal SharePoint, so files stay in sync across the suite.  Plus, Microsoft Global Senior Director Seth Patton hypes up the security of OneDrive, saying that it means most customers' most stringent requirements.  \"That's a pretty big deal,\" Patton tells Business Insider.  Still, with this offer, Microsoft might find itself preaching to the choir somewhat. While Box, Dropbox, and Google's G Suite certainly have a certain number of large-enterprise customers, they're mostly known for appealing to smaller and midsize businesses.  Microsoft is already generally considered to be the leader in large companies, given the fact that its Office suite is, and remains, the gold standard in the productivity market. Still, with analysts urging Dropbox to pursue an enterprise-focused strategy ahead of its purported IPO, perhaps Microsoft is just trying to consolidate its lead ahead of time.  After this offer expires, customer will have to pay for OneDrive for Business like usual. Plans start at $5 per user per month, or else you could opt in for a $12.50 per user per month subscription to the Office 365 cloud productivity suite \u2014 at which point you'd get access to all of the Office applications, like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, too.", "stock": "MSFT", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-06", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-has-a-new-plan-to-steal-google-dropbox-and-box-customers-2018-2"}, {"article": "Getty Images/Stephen Brashear  Microsoft's stock fell on Thursday morning after the company reported modest quarterly earnings.  Investors were concerned they did not see enough accelerated growth, and that profits would not be returned in the form of increased buybacks or dividends.  Watch Microsoft's stock move in real time here.    Shares of Microsoft slipped after the company reported quarterly profits that modestly beat expectations, but failed to enthuse investors.  Microsoft was down 1.45% at $93.63 in pre-market trading on Thursday.  Though Microsoft reported better-than-expected earnings of $0.96 a share on revenue of $28.92 billion, the company was also hit with a one-time charge of $13.8 billion due to the newly-passed tax law.  The \"lack of accelerated capital return\" and the newly guided corporate tax rate below 21% \"may modestly disappoint,\" said RBC Analyst Ross MacMillan. He said that the technology company remains focused on reinvesting in growth rather than returning profits, in the form of a buyback or special dividend, to investors.  Yet revenues from Microsoft's Productivity and Business Processes segment, which includes Microsoft Office, the Office 365 cloud suite, and LinkedIn, grew 25% year-over-year and its Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes its Azure platform, grew 15% during the same period. Revenue from its personal computing segment posted modest growth of 2%.  Still, MacMillan raised his price target to $105, up 12% from its current price.  He believes that Microsoft could see more upside with an acceleration of Azure and LinkedIn services and offerings, the wider adoption of the Azure Stack, Microsoft's hybrid cloud platform, and a markedly improved commercial PC market, as well as improved Windows performance.

Microsoft, No. 17-2, has been closely watched by the technology industry, which sometimes has a testy relationship with the Justice Department.  The dispute arose from a federal drug investigation in which prosecutors sought the emails of a suspect stored in a Microsoft data center in Dublin.

A federal magistrate judge in New York granted the government\u2019s request to issue a warrant for the data under the 1986 federal law, the Stored Communications Act. A federal district judge agreed.  Microsoft challenged the warrant, arguing that prosecutors could not force it to hand over customer emails stored abroad.  A three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in Manhattan, ruled that the warrant in the case could not be used to obtain evidence beyond the nation\u2019s borders because the 1986 law did not apply extraterritorially. In a concurring opinion, Judge Gerard E. Lynch said the question was a close one, and he urged Congress to revise the 1986 law, which he said was badly outdated.  Michael R.

She was racist, xenophobic and downright filthy. At one point, she said the Holocaust did not happen. But she was old technology.  Let loose on the internet nearly two years ago, Tay was an experimental system built by Microsoft. She was designed to chat with digital hipsters in breezy, sometimes irreverent lingo, and American netizens quickly realized they could coax her into spewing vile and offensive language. This was largely the result of a simple design flaw \u2014 Tay was programmed to repeat what was said to her \u2014 but the damage was done. Within hours, Microsoft shut her down for good.  Since then, a new breed of conversational technology has emerged inside Microsoft and other internet giants that is far more nimble and effective than the techniques that underpinned Tay. And researchers believe these new systems will improve at an even faster rate when they are let loose on the internet. But sometimes, like Tay, these conversational systems reflect the worst of human nature. And given the history here, companies like Microsoft are reluctant to set them free \u2014 at least for now.  These systems do not simply repeat what is said to them or respond with canned answers. They teach themselves to carry on a conversation by carefully analyzing reams of real human dialogue. At Microsoft, for instance, a new system learns to chat by analyzing thousands of online discussions pulled from services like Twitter and Reddit. When you send this bot a message, it chooses a response after generating dozens of possibilities and ranking each according to how well it mirrors those human conversations.  If you complain about breaking your ankle during a football game, it is nimble enough to give you some sympathy. \u201cOuch, that\u2019s not good,\u201d it might say. \u201cHope your ankle feels better soon.\u201d If you mention house guests or dinner plans, it responds in remarkably precise and familiar ways.  marcy79  conversational_bot  Closest match to human speech Closest match to human speech Lower-ranking potential responses Lower-ranking potential responses  Despite its sophistication, this conversational system can also be nonsensical, impolite and even offensive at times. If you mention your company\u2019s C.E.O., it may assume you are talking about a man \u2014 unaware that women are chief executives, too. If you ask a simple question, you may get a cheeky reply.  marcy79  conversational_bot    Microsoft\u2019s researchers believe they can significantly improve this technology by having it chat with large numbers of people. This would help identify its flaws and generate much sharper conversational data for the system to learn from. \u201cIt is a problem if we can\u2019t get this in front of real users \u2014 and have them tell us what is right and what isn\u2019t,\u201d said a longtime Microsoft researcher, Bill Dolan.  But there lies the conundrum. Because its flaws could spark public complaints \u2014 and bad press \u2014 Microsoft is wary of pushing this technology onto the internet.  The project represents a much wider effort to build a new breed of computing system that is truly conversational. At companies like Facebook, Amazon and Salesforce as well as Microsoft, the hope is that this technology will provide smoother and easier ways of interacting with machines \u2014 easier than a keyboard and mouse, easier than a touch-screen, easier than Siri and other digital assistants now on the market, which are still a long way from fluid conversation.  For years, Silicon Valley companies trumpeted \u201cchatbots\u201d that could help you, say, book your next plane flight or solve a problem with your new computer tablet. But these have never lived up to the billing, providing little more than canned responses to common queries.  Now, thanks to the rise of algorithms that can quickly learn tasks on their own, research in conversational computing is advancing. But the industry as a whole faces the same problem as Microsoft: The new breed of chatbot talks more like a human, but that is not always a good thing.  \u201cIt is more powerful,\u201d said Alex Lebrun, who works on similar conversational systems at Facebook\u2019s artificial intelligence lab in Paris. \u201cBut it is more dangerous.\u201d  The new breed relies on \u201cneural networks,\u201d complex algorithms that can learn tasks by identifying patterns in large pools of data. Over the last five years, these algorithms have accelerated the evolution of systems that can automatically recognize faces and objects, identify commands spoken into smartphones, and translate from one language to another. They are also speeding the development of conversational systems \u2014 though this research is significantly more complex and will take longer to mature.  It may seem surprising that Microsoft researchers are training their conversational system on dialogue from Twitter and Reddit, two social networking services known for vitriolic content. But even on Twitter and Reddit, people are generally civil when they really fall into conversation, and these services are brimming with this kind of dialogue.  Microsoft researchers massage the conversational data they load into the system in small ways, but for the most part, they simply feed the raw dialogues into their neural networks, and these algorithms therefore learn from interactions that are very human. According to Mr. Dolan, in analyzing this data, the system learns to perform well even in the face of poor spelling and grammar. If you type \u201cwinne tonight drink resttaurant,\u201d it might respond with: \u201ci\u2019m not a fan of wine.\u201d It can engage in a real back-and-forth dialogue, asking for everything it needs to, say, connect with you on Linkedin. And for the most part, it behaves with civility.  Top 25 Responses to \u201cwho's Adele?\u201d  When Microsoft\u2019s conversational system receives a message, it generates dozens of possible responses and ranks each according to how well it mirrors human dialogue.

Though these conversational systems are generally civil, they are sometimes rude \u2014 or worse. It is not just that the technology is new and flawed. Because they learn from vast amounts of human conversation, they learn from the mistakes we humans make, and the prejudice we exhibit.  Mr. Lebrun estimated that once in every thousand responses, this new breed of chatbot will say something racist or aggressive or otherwise unwanted. Researchers can fix these problems, but that involves gathering more and better data, or tweaking the algorithms through a process of extreme trial and error.  This is a problem for A.I. services in general. More than two years ago, a software developer noticed that the new Google Photos service was identifying black people as gorillas. Google promptly barred the service from identifying gorillas and similar animals, and it has yet to provide a fix.  But identifying and solving problems with conversational systems is harder, just because the scope of these systems \u2014 general dialogue \u2014 is so large. Image recognition is a single task. Conversation is many tasks, because it bounces back and forth, and each response can affect all the responses to come.  For this reason, Adam Coates, a partner at the venture capital firm Khosla Ventures who previously oversaw the Silicon Valley A.I. lab attached to the Chinese internet giant Baidu, warns that building a truly conversational system is far more difficult than building services that can recognize giraffes, say, or translate between German and French. \u201cThere is a huge technical barrier here. We really don\u2019t know how to build a personal assistant,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may not be simply a matter of more data. We may be missing a big idea.\u201d  In the short term, many believe, conversational systems will be most effective if they are limited to particular tasks, like asking for IT help or getting medical advice. That is still a long way from a bot that will respond well to anything you say. But Mr. Dolan believes these systems will continue to evolve over the next few years, provided companies like Microsoft can get them in front of the public.", "stock": "MSFT", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-21", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/02/21/technology/conversational-bots.html"}, {"article": "Q.

On Tuesday the Supreme Court will consider if U.S. internet providers can subvert federal law and public safety.  At issue in Microsoft v. U.S. is whether warrants issued under the 1986 Stored Communications Act apply to records stored on the cloud. The law allows the government to obtain records from a U.S. internet provider if there is probable cause of a crime. A special Section 2703 warrant functions like a subpoena since law enforcement doesn\u2019t directly seize records from servers.  In 2013 the U.S. government sought such a warrant for contents associated with an MSN.com email account believed to include evidence of narcotics trafficking. A federal magistrate issued a warrant covering \u201cinformation associated with\u201d the account \u201cstored at premises owned, maintained, controlled, or operated by Microsoft Corporation.\u201d  While Microsoft agreed to disclose records stored on its U.S. servers, it refused to turn over content on its \u201ccloud\u201d servers in Dublin, Ireland. The Redmond, Wash.-based company, which was held in civil contempt, says the law doesn\u2019t authorize extraterritorial warrants. It\u2019s right on this point, but wrong on everything else.  In Morrison (2010) and RJR Nabisco, Inc. (2016), the Supreme Court developed a two-step analysis to determine if a law applies overseas. First, courts must ask whether a law includes a \u201cclear, affirmative indication that [the statutory provision] applies extraterritorially.\u201d If not, the statute is presumed not to be extraterritorial.  But then courts must assess whether a case primarily \u201cinvolves a domestic application of the statute\u201d by looking at its \u201cfocus.\u201d As the Court held in Nabisco, \u201cIf the conduct relevant to the statute\u2019s focus occurred in the United States, then the case involves a permissible domestic application even if other conduct occurred abroad.\u201d  This second part is key in the Microsoft case. There\u2019s no disputing that the Stored Communications Act doesn\u2019t expressly apply to foreign parties. The government could not compel an internet provider based in France to hand over a French citizen\u2019s emails. But as the judge who issued the warrant observed, the government\u2019s application of the law \u201cdoes not criminalize conduct taking place in a foreign country\u201d and doesn\u2019t deploy U.S. cops overseas.  Employees at Microsoft headquarters could obtain records stored on foreign servers with a few keystrokes. Internet providers typically decide where to store data to maximize efficiency. Google cuts up emails into \u201cshards,\u201d which can move between countries within seconds without human intervention. U.S. internet users aren\u2019t entitled to know where in the cloud their records are stored, let alone to recourse under U.S. law if a company moves them.  A federal district judge held that the Microsoft warrant wasn\u2019t extraterritorial since the disclosure of records to the government occurs in the U.S. But a Second Circuit Court of Appeals panel disagreed in 2016, and tech companies have since resisted warrants for data stored overseas. While the circuit refused to hear the case en banc, Judges Jos\u00e9 Cabranes, Dennis Jacobs, Reena Raggi and Christopher Droney wrote an incisive dissent on the far-reaching implications of the panel\u2019s rogue ruling, which conflicts with every other district and magistrate decision.  The panel \u201chas substantially burdened the government\u2019s legitimate law enforcement efforts; created a roadmap for the facilitation of criminal activity; and impeded programs to protect the national security of the United States and its allies,\u201d the judges explained.  Tech firms argue that a Court decision upholding the government\u2019s authority to compel disclosure of data overseas would cause international friction due to conflicting legal regimes on data privacy. But more than a dozen countries including Australia, France, Ireland, Canada and the U.K. assert this authority. The U.S. would be an outlier.  They also argue that Congress is better situated to resolve the complicated issues of cloud computing that were never envisioned three decades ago. Senators Orrin Hatch and Chris Coons have introduced legislation to modernize the Stored Communications Act and clarify legal obligations for internet providers.  But pending legislation shouldn\u2019t obviate a judicial decision on a black-and-white legal question critical to public safety.

MSFT -0.53% is scheduled to report fiscal second-quarter earnings after the market closes Wednesday. Here\u2019s what to expect.  EARNINGS FORECAST: Analysts surveyed by S&P Global Market Intelligence expect Microsoft to report per-share earnings of 86 cents under generally accepted accounting principles, up from 80 cents a year earlier. Microsoft no longer reports adjusted figures, reflecting accounting changes it adopted at the start of the fiscal year. The year ago figure reflects that change.  REVENUE FORECAST: Analysts expect Microsoft to post revenue of $28.41 billion, up from $25.83 billion a year earlier. The year-ago figure, too, reflects the new accounting standard.  WHAT TO WATCH:  CLOUDY CONDITIONS: In the last year, Microsoft has emerged as the primary competitor to Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s market-leading cloud-infrastructure business. Three months ago, Microsoft said its commercial-cloud run rate\u2014the last month of sales of its Azure infrastructure services and Office 365 products, multiplied by 12\u2014topped $20 billion, nine months ahead of the company\u2019s target. RBC Capital Markets analyst Ross MacMillan, in a recent research report, said he expects 85% growth in Azure revenue and 42% growth in the commercial version of Office 365. Mr. MacMillan estimates Microsoft\u2019s Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes Azure, will climb 10% to $7.4 billion in the quarter, and that its Productivity and Business Processes segment, which includes Office, will grow 24% to $8.9 billion.  PLAYING GAMES: Microsoft\u2019s Xbox videogame console generally does its best business during the holiday quarter, and was primed to do particularly well with the debut of its Xbox One X console in November. Stifel Nicolaus & Co. analyst Brad Reback wrote in a research note that Xbox outsold Sony Corp.\u2019s PlayStation 4 in December, but both were outsold by Nintendo Co.\u2019s Switch. Xbox is part of Microsoft\u2019s More Personal Computing segment, and the console\u2019s gains likely will be offset by continued sluggish PC sales, which track closely to the company\u2019s Windows operating system business. World-wide PC shipments grew 0.7% in the last quarter, according to International Data Corp. Mr. Reback estimates the segment, which is Microsoft\u2019s largest, will grow 0.6% to $11.96 billion.  TAXING TIMES: \u201cTax rate and repatriation commentary from a historically conservative management team represent the key wild card for the quarter,\u201d Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss wrote in a research report. Mr. Weiss estimates Microsoft\u2019s tax rate will decline to 16% as a result of the tax-code overhaul President Donald Trump signed into law in December. A year ago, Microsoft\u2019s effective tax rate was 18%.  CASH CONSIDERATIONS: Mr. Weiss expects Microsoft to eventually repatriate cash held abroad, which totaled $132.1 billion at the end of the fiscal first quarter, behind only Apple Inc.\u2019s $252.3 billion. He didn\u2019t speculate when Microsoft will bring the money to the U.S., but estimates the company will pay about $21 billion in taxes as a result of the tax law, which hits companies with a one-time tax of 15.5% on overseas profits held in cash and other liquid assets. RBC\u2019s Mr. MacMillan wrote about the potential for domestic acquisitions and shareholder returns through dividends or buybacks. Earlier this month, Apple said it would pay $38 billion in taxes as it brings home the vast majority of its overseas cash.

MSFT -0.53% took a $13.8 billion charge related to the new U.S. tax law but reported significant growth in its cloud operations, the business fueling the company\u2019s resurgence.  Microsoft keeps overseas the vast majority of its cash, which rose to $142.8 billion in the quarter. In an interview, Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood declined to say when the company might bring home some of that money.  Ms. Hood said Microsoft has been \u201cone of the leading returners of capital to shareholders\u201d in recent years, using debt to finance much of that. She said the cash would mitigate the need to turn to debt markets to pay for stock repurchases.  Microsoft already has carved a spot for itself as the No. 2 company behind Amazon.com Inc. in renting computing power and storage over the web. For its fiscal second quarter, the company reported strong gains in the two biggest pieces of its cloud-computing business: its Azure infrastructure services and Office 365 online-productivity business.  Though Microsoft doesn\u2019t disclose revenue for those businesses, it said Azure jumped 98% and Office 365 grew 41%. In the previous quarter, Azure gained 90% and Office 365 grew 42%.  Its Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes Azure, climbed 15% to $7.8 billion. Its Productivity and Business Processes segment, which includes Office, gained 25% to $8.95 billion.  Overall, Microsoft posted a loss of $6.3 billion, or 82 cents a share, compared with a profit of $6.27 billion, or 80 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue grew 12% to $28.92 billion.  Excluding the impact of the tax law, Microsoft reported a profit of $7.5 billion, or 96 cents a share.  Analysts surveyed by S&P Global Market Intelligence expected Microsoft to report per-share earnings of 86 cents on revenue of $28.41 billion.  Shares, which have climbed nearly 50% in the past year to set records, fell a penny to $95 in after-hours trading.  The company\u2019s adjusted tax rate, which doesn\u2019t count the big charge, was 18%, up slightly from a year ago. Looking ahead, Ms. Hood said it expects a 16% tax rate for the second half of the fiscal year, plus or minus 2 percentage points. For fiscal 2019, the company expects the tax rate to be slightly below the new U.S. corporate rate of 21%.  Microsoft rose to its former tech dominance on the strength of Windows, its PC operating system. And while the More Personal Computing segment that includes Windows is Microsoft\u2019s largest, it is also the company\u2019s slowest growing.  That is in part because growth in world-wide PC sales remains sluggish, inching up only 0.7% in the last quarter, according to International Data Corp. More Personal Computing, though, gained 2% to $12.17 billion in the latest period.  In a conference call with Wall Street analysts, Chief Executive Satya Nadella said investments in security technology helped Microsoft quickly address the recent threats from the Spectre and Meltdown processor vulnerabilities.  \u201cOur investments to make Windows 10 the most secure, always up-to-date operating system enabled us to move quickly to protect customers in the face of these threats,\u201d Mr. Nadella said.  The More Personal Computing segment also includes Microsoft\u2019s Xbox videogame business. The holiday quarter is particularly important for gaming at Microsoft, even more so after the company released its new Xbox One X console in November. In the period, gaming revenue\u2014which includes sales of the Xbox console, Xbox Live subscriptions and transactions, and game and accessory sales\u2014rose 8%.

The company says it shouldn\u2019t have to hand over emails stored on a server in Ireland. Photo: NIALL CARSON/PRESS ASSOCIATION/GETTY IMAGES  WASHINGTON\u2014Technology companies will square off with law enforcement on Tuesday as the Supreme Court hears arguments on whether emails and other customer data stored overseas are subject to U.S. search warrants.  The case is one of several legal battles on law-enforcement access to private online data, and it requires the justices to interpret a law that Congress wrote before email and cloud computing were part of everyday life.  A federal appeals court, in a 2016 case involving Microsoft Corp. , handed a blow to prosecutors by ruling that such warrants can\u2019t be enforced on U.S. providers if the data is stored exclusively on foreign servers. That is the decision the Supreme Court is reviewing.  The case highlights broader tensions between tech titans, which view protecting user privacy as a priority, and authorities who believe privacy concerns should take a back seat to public safety in certain circumstances.  Battle lines have been firmly drawn, with opposing camps warning of serious harm if the court rules against their position.  The Justice Department and state attorneys general say the lower court ruling has hampered investigations into an array of crimes, from narcotics trafficking to arson to child pornography. Emails and electronic evidence are now critical to virtually every criminal investigation, they say.  Microsoft, Google and other technology companies say the Justice Department\u2019s position would leave them stuck between U.S. law enforcement and their obligation to abide by privacy laws in foreign jurisdictions. The companies also say the case could threaten American dominance in the $250 billion cloud-computing industry, because foreign clients won\u2019t use U.S. firms if their data isn\u2019t protected.  Foreign governments also have weighed in, urging the Supreme Court not to interpret U.S. law in a way that intrudes on their sovereignty.  \u201cThis may be a case in which the Supreme Court has no truly satisfying outcome available to it, in part because it is being asked to interpret a 1986 law that is not a good fit for the kind of large-scale, cross-border data-storage practices of today,\u201d said David Newman, a lawyer with Morrison & Foerster LLP who closely follows privacy and data-security issues.  The law at issue is the Stored Communications Act, passed by Congress more than 30 years ago to provide privacy protections for electronic records.  The Justice Department applied for a warrant requiring Microsoft to turn over email information from an account allegedly tied to illegal drug activity in the U.S. A magistrate judge issued the warrant after finding the government had established probable cause that the account was connected to narcotics trafficking.  Newsletter Sign-up  Microsoft handed over some account data that was stored in the U.S. but said it shouldn\u2019t have to hand over the emails, which were stored on a server in Ireland. The company said the government has never suggested that the account holder is a citizen or resident of the U.S.  The Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with Microsoft, ruling the 1986 law didn\u2019t apply beyond U.S. territory.  Microsoft said in its Supreme Court brief that the materials targeted for government seizure are covered by Irish and European Union law. That means the U.S. is seeking to assert the 1986 law beyond domestic borders, which isn\u2019t allowed, the company argued.  Microsoft conceded that U.S. law is outdated but said that was an issue for lawmakers, not judges, to address.  \u201cOnly Congress has the authority and tools to rewrite the statute to strike a new, 21st-Century balance between law-enforcement interests, our relations with foreign nations, the privacy of our citizens, and the competitiveness of our technology industry,\u201d the company said in its brief.  A bipartisan group of lawmakers has introduced legislation to tackle cross-border data issues, but it isn\u2019t clear if the bill will advance in Congress.  The Justice Department said it isn\u2019t seeking to apply the current U.S. law extraterritorially. It noted the government sought disclosure in the U.S., where officials at Microsoft\u2019s headquarters in Redmond, Wash., have ready access to files stored abroad.  \u201cMicrosoft\u2019s employees could prepare that disclosure without leaving their desks in the United States,\u201d Solicitor General Noel Francisco wrote in a court brief.  The department argued that Microsoft\u2019s position could keep investigators from accessing emails and other files even if the subject of the investigation is based in the U.S., if a company chooses to store the consumer\u2019s files overseas.  There is a diplomatic process, governed by legal assistance treaties, that allows the U.S. to request that foreign law-enforcement counterparts share sought-after data, but it can be slow and ineffective, the department said.  WSJ's Joanna Stern \"bumps\" into Peggy Johnson in the elevator at D.Live and asks about Microsoft's next big investments, Solitaire and women in technology. Photo: Andria Chamberlin for The Wall Street Journal  While the case before the court involves Microsoft, the government also took aim at Google, whose network-management practices often involve dividing data from a single customer file into chunks that are moved within an international network of data centers.  If Microsoft\u2019s arguments prevail, then Google\u2019s practices would make its data inaccessible to law enforcement, the Justice Department said.  Google has been involved in several warrant battles with federal and state authorities, agreeing to be held in contempt in some cases for failing to turn over data. The company, like Microsoft, is pushing for a legislative solution.  Since the Second Circuit ruling, legal battles between prosecutors and tech companies have continued in other jurisdictions, and several courts have ruled in the government\u2019s favor, including in California, Florida, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.  A Supreme Court decision is expected by the end of June.

In the same period, the More Personal Computing unit, which includes Windows, gained 2% to $12.17 billion.  \u201cHaving a deep sense of customers\u2019 unmet and unarticulated needs must drive our innovation,\u201d Mr. Nadella said in the email he sent to employees Thursday morning. \u201cWe can\u2019t let any organizational boundaries get in the way of innovation for our customers. This is why a growth-mindset culture matters.\u201d  Microsoft declined to make executives available for comment.  In a post on Microsoft\u2019s LinkedIn page, Mr. Myerson, who has run the Windows business since 2013, said the day was an \u201cemotional\u201d one for him but expressed his \u201congoing enthusiasm for Microsoft.\u201d  For most of its 43 years, Microsoft and Windows have been nearly synonymous. Under Mr. Nadella\u2019s predecessor, Steve Ballmer, products were sometimes stalled, or even killed, because they didn\u2019t help expand the market for the operating system.  That Mr. Nadella is willing to shift the company\u2019s focus away from Windows illustrates the irreversible migration from personal computing to mobile devices and the web. It also shows how Mr. Nadella is putting his own imprint on the tech giant.  \u201cHe\u2019s clearly not handcuffed by history,\u201d said Stifel Nicolaus & Co. analyst Brad Reback.  Mr. Nadella is able to break from the past because, during his four years as chief executive, Microsoft has emerged as a leader in cloud computing. Its Azure operations is No. 2 behind Amazon.com in the cloud-infrastructure market. And its Office 365 productivity apps and its Dynamics business-software services are rapidly growing, multibillion-dollar businesses.  \u201cThe Microsoft of old could never have made this move,\u201d Mr. Reback said. \u201cBut the pieces were not in place to make the move.\u201d  Mr. Myerson, a 21-year Microsoft veteran, will leave the company and help with the transition \u201cover the coming months,\u201d Mr. Nadella wrote.  \ufeff The company is breaking Windows in pieces. The platform technology, on which Microsoft\u2019s partners build their own devices, apps and services, will now fall under Scott Guthrie, who runs the Azure business. Mr. Guthrie\u2019s unit, called Cloud + AI Platform, will also include the company\u2019s mixed-reality business, including Microsoft\u2019s Hololens device, as well as its artificial-intelligence business.  Microsoft\u2019s devices business, including its Surface lineup of computers, will fall to Rajesh Jha, who has been in charge of Microsoft\u2019s Office group. The new, bigger unit, called Experiences & Devices, will also include Microsoft\u2019s efforts to develop new features in Windows.  In his note, Mr. Nadella called the future of Windows \u201cbright,\u201d as the company pushes to develop features that take advantage of new types of devices and emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence. Nearly 700 million devices run Windows 10, the software\u2019s latest version. All told, some version of Windows is on more than 1.5 billion devices world-wide. In the most recent quarter, the More Personal Computing unit accounted for 42% of Microsoft\u2019s revenue.  \u201cThis is the most sweeping reorg that I can recall,\u201d said Brad Silverberg, who ran the Windows division when Microsoft launched its seminal Windows 95 operating system.  In the 1990s, Windows was so dominant that a federal judge ruled that it was a monopoly. The U.S. Department of Justice sought to break up Microsoft, accusing the company of abusing its dominance in the PC operating system market to crush rivals. The company ultimately signed a consent decree in 2002, agreeing, in part, to make Windows interoperable with non-Microsoft software.  While Microsoft is still focused on building the platform upon which other tech companies run their technology, that focus is now on Azure, said Mr. Silverberg, a venture capitalist who co-founded Fuel Capital, a San Francisco-based firm. He praised Mr. Nadella\u2019s acknowledgment of Windows\u2019 reduced importance.  \u201cHe recognizes the world for what it is, not what it used to be,\u201d Mr. Silverberg said.

Alphabet, the parent company of search-engine giant Google, became the second publicly traded U.S. company ever to reach a market value of $800 billion Monday, joining iPhone maker Apple. Alphabet\u2019s Class A shares rose 1.8% to $1,164.00.  Meantime, Microsoft was on track Monday to become the third public U.S. company ever to close with a market value of $700 billion, joining Apple and Alphabet. Shares rose as much as 1.4% to $91.23 and were recently up 1.2%. On Jan. 16, Microsoft briefly touched $700 billion before falling back below that level.  Alphabet has already added about $74 billion in market capitalization this year as of midday Monday, while Microsoft is up about $43 billion, a combined total of $117 billion in added market value for the two tech giants since the start of 2018.  Apple crossed the $700 billion threshold in February 2015 and passed $800 billion and $900 billion last year. It hit that last milestone shortly after Alphabet hit $700 billion.  Monday\u2019s fresh highs are the latest major markers hit by U.S. internet giants in the past year. Investors have flocked to the largest technology firms for their ability to grow revenue despite mixed economic data. Some analysts have said they expect recent gains and lofty valuations in the S&P 500 information technology sector\u2014which is up 42% in the past year\u2014have left the grouping vulnerable to a pullback, but technology stocks have still been among the best performers at the start of 2018.  On Jan. 8, e-commerce firm Amazon.com crossed $600 billion for the first time.  Microsoft\u2019s recent rise has come as the software giant continues to prioritize cloud computing. Microsoft\u2019s next earnings report is expected at the end of the month.  Alphabet has surged over the past year as advertisers spend more and more money on its platforms. Google and Facebook controlled nearly two-thirds of total digital ad spending last year, according to eMarketer, and Alphabet has taken another leg higher in the first days of 2018 as Facebook shares have stumbled on speculation that the retooling of its platform will hurt its advertising revenue.  Although some analysts have said they expect investors to begin to move money out of the tech sector, few think technology stocks are anywhere close to the froth from the dot-com bubble. Microsoft\u2019s recent climb to $600 billion, a mark it also hit in the late 1990s before falling, took much longer than its first ascent.  It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess what the next technology market-cap milestone will be. Some had speculated that Apple could climb to $1 trillion, but the iPhone maker has fallen back around$900 billion instead amid doubts about the success of its latest products.", "stock": "MSFT", "label": 1, "date": "2018-01-22", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2018/01/22/more-milestones-alphabet-hits-800-billion-microsoft-clears-700-billion/"}, {"article": "The Pretty One  In most ways, Dell\u2019s XPS 13 is every bit as good as any of its competitors. In one way it\u2019s the best: By nearly eliminating the bezel around the display, Dell squeezed the XPS 13 into a smaller body than all of its competitors. Without those big borders, the screen just looks better. The XPS 13 scored the second-best time in my battery tests, it has all the right chips and features, and it looks like it cost good money.  But\u2026 that tiny bezel forced Dell to move the webcam down below the screen, which is a terrible place. Rather than framing my face, the camera stares up my nose. (Dell says most users don\u2019t mind the placement.)  The bigger problem is that the XPS 13 you want costs $1,200. The standard model comes with a paltry four gigs of RAM and 128 gigs of storage\u2014neither of which will suffice.  Microsoft | Surface Pro $958 Battery Looks Power  Versatility  PROS  CONS  Hard to use on your lap; low-end processor  Light, thin and versatile; most tablet-like of the bunch  The Portable One  Like the best camera, the best laptop is the one you have with you. No Windows computer combines portability and functionality quite like Microsoft Corp.\u2019s Surface Pro, the tablet/laptop hybrid that inspired so many competitors. It\u2019s the size and shape of an iPad, with the full power of Windows.  Unfortunately, all that versatility compromises the Surface Pro\u2019s utility, and I don\u2019t just mean the smaller screen. And, because the crucial keyboard accessory sells separately for $160, it\u2019s deceptively expensive. (I\u2019ve included it in my pricing, because you need it.) The only way to hit the $1,000 target and still get the whole kit is to buy the cheapest model, which uses a vastly underpowered processor. You might opt for Microsoft\u2019s other offering in this range, the Surface Laptop but, as comfortable as it is to use, it doesn\u2019t measure up to my other picks.  | Swift 3 Acer $999 Battery Looks Power  Versatility  PROS  CONS  Big and heavy; more desktop than laptop  Lots of ports; big screen and roomy keyboard  The Powerful One  Many laptops in this price range offer enough processing oomph for web browsing, Netflixing and Exceling, but not gamer-grade horsepower. Acer Inc.\u2019s Swift 3 does a little better. Its Core i7 processor, more powerful than you\u2019ll often find at this price, makes the machine more suitable for Photoshop users or inveterate tab-hoarders. Just don\u2019t expect it to run \u201cFortnite.\u201d  Acer also added a large selection of ports to the Swift 3 and a relatively large 14-inch display. But all that extra stuff makes it larger and heavier than my other picks. It works as a stashable in-home family PC, but by today\u2019s standards, it isn\u2019t especially mobile.  Lenovo | Yoga 720 $989 Battery Looks Power  Versatility  PROS  CONS  Shallow keyboard; subpar speakers  Light and flexible; often cheapest of the bunch  The Affordable One  Lenovo Group Ltd.\u2019s Yoga 720 has almost everything you\u2019d want in a laptop, and I\u2019ve seen it on sale for as little as $750. Its screen back flips to lie flat against the keyboard so you can hold it like a tablet. It\u2019s fast enough, lasts long enough and looks good enough.  My issues with the Yoga individually feel minor: The speakers sound mushy, the keyboard is a bit shallow, the design is bland. Together, they make clear why the 720 is cheaper than the others: It\u2019s a good computer for the price, but if you spend more on something else, you\u2019ll be glad.  HP | Spectre x360 $999 Battery Looks Power  Versatility  PROS  CONS  Gets dirty easily; uneven keyboard backlight  Clean, attractive look; excellent keyboard  The Best One  If all you want is to stop reading and just buy a new computer, here\u2019s your answer: The best $1,000 Windows computer is HP\u2019s latest Spectre x360, a machine that does everything well. We\u2019ve been recommending this line for a few years now, and HP just keeps improving it.  The x360 checks all the spec boxes, looks as good as anything out of Cupertino, Calif., and is enjoyable to use, from the speakers to the keyboard. It has a 360-degree hinge that flips the laptop into a tablet for drawing or using in a cramped space. It uses new USB-C ports for charging and data, but also offers an older-style standard USB-A port.  In my testing, the x360\u2019s biggest problem has been the lid\u2019s tendency to scuff in my bag. It came in third on my super-harsh battery test, behind the Surface Pro and nearly in line with the Dell: You should have no trouble using it through a workday. It\u2019s not rich with new ideas about what computers can be, but when you have work to do, that isn\u2019t the priority. You just want a laptop, and HP made a terrific one.

Shares fell as much as 5% in after-hours trading Wednesday before rebounding. Link:  Microsoft\u2014Down 0.2%: Microsoft said it recorded a $13.8 billion charge related to changes to U.S. tax law that drove the software company into a quarterly loss but posted big fiscal second-quarter gains in its cloud-computing business.  AT&T\u2014Up 3.2%: AT&T expects to keep an extra $20.42 billion in cash for 2018 thanks to new federal tax cuts, a windfall the telecom giant said it plans to spend on network enhancements.

PayPal Holdings Inc.\u2014Down 6.5%: News hit that PayPal will lose a chunk of its business from eBay, as the online marketplace said it would start managing the payments flow of buyers and sellers transacting on its website. PayPal also said fourth-quarter profit rose 59% despite the mobile payments company booking a big charge related to the U.S. tax overhaul.  EBay\u2014Up 11%: EBay also reported earnings and revenue that met Wall Street expectations, as sales rose 9% in the fourth quarter. The company\u2019s 2018 projections topped estimates.

AMZN -1.22%  The search-engine operator has plans to build three new underwater fiber-optic cables lining ocean areas from the Pacific to the North Sea, extending its private data network to regions competitors haven\u2019t touched with similar projects.  The cables, expected to be finished in 2019, are designed to speed the transfer of data and reroute users to servers around the globe if a region fails or gets overloaded.  Google said the investments could cost hundreds of millions of dollars but are worth the expense to get a better shot at the multibillion-dollar cloud-computing market.  \u201cI would prefer not to have to be in the cable-building consortium business,\u201d said Ben Treynor, vice president of Google\u2019s cloud platform, but when the company looked at ways to push its cloud business past new frontiers like Australia and South America, \u201cthere weren\u2019t a lot of great options.\u201d  Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOGL -0.12% owns a massive network of fiber-optic cables and data centers built up over the past decade. Mr. Treynor said the infrastructure already adds up to the world\u2019s biggest private network, handling roughly 25% of the world\u2019s internet traffic, and helps Google control its data-intensive software without relying on telecom companies.  The projects would bring the number of subsea cables Google has helped build to 11 after a decade of nonstop construction. Its engineers rely on all those conduits to refresh search results, move video files and serve cloud-computing customers who do business in different parts of the globe.  That last business line could use a boost. Google is third in cloud-computing revenue behind Amazon and Microsoft in the race to win big customers, which run everything from shopping websites to government databases on the tech giants\u2019 computer servers. Billions of dollars of annual revenue are at stake as corporations move their information-technology operations to more flexible systems on the cloud.  Google has teamed up with other firms, including domestic telephone operators and Facebook Inc., to build its subsea cables. But it is breaking precedent with its longest, fully private long-distance cable, which will stretch 6,200 miles from Los Angeles to Chile, where the company finished a data center in 2015.  \u201cThis is, I believe, the largest single pipe into Chile,\u201d Mr. Treynor said of the Curie cable, named after the French scientist Marie Curie.  Related Video \u200bGoogle handles 90% of the world's internet searches, and it increasingly is promoting a single answer for many questions. Even subjective or unanswerable queries sometimes get seemingly definitive answers. Here's how the algorithms are -- and aren't -- working. Video/Photo Illustration: Heather Seidel/The Wall Street Journal  The company is planning to share capacity with Facebook on a planned 4,500-mile cable from the East Coast of the U.S. to Denmark, with a pit stop in Ireland. The Havfrue line, Danish for \u201cmermaid,\u201d will give the company more bandwidth across the Atlantic Ocean.  A planned 2,400-mile cable called HK-G, running from Hong Kong to Guam, will hook up with other cable systems linking Australia, East Asia and North America.  Google\u2019s new cables will help link five new regions for cloud customers in Montreal, the Netherlands, Los Angeles, Finland and Hong Kong.  The company\u2019s network-driven strategy has gained it some attention. PayPal Inc. technology chief Sri Shivananda said the company spent months considering where to move some of its developer and testing systems before settling on Google in mid-2017.  Mr. Shivananda said the payments processor was impressed by Google\u2019s consistently fast connections. Transactions that take too long often make users abandon a purchase entirely, he said.  Some of PayPal\u2019s acquired companies, including Braintree and Venmo, still run partly on Amazon. \u201cWe\u2019ll be a multi-cloud environment\u201d for the foreseeable future, Mr. Shivananda said.  \u2014Jack Nicas contributed to this article.", "stock": "MSFT", "label": -1, "date": "2018-01-16", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-plans-to-expand-huge-undersea-cables-to-boost-cloud-business-1516098601"}, {"article": "What\u2019s more, more than half of members, 51%, used LinkedIn every few weeks or less often, Pew found. By comparison, 76% of Facebook Inc. members used the service at least daily, Pew found.  At the time of the deal, Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella said one goal was to weave together the tools people use to get their jobs done and professional networks that connect workers.  To achieve that end, LinkedIn needs members such as Mr. Frank to engage more frequently, updating their job titles, contacts, career achievements and more\u2014data crucial to Microsoft\u2019s plans to integrate its expensive acquisition. Microsoft wants to pump that data into artificial-intelligence offerings, business-software services and even its Office productivity tools, such as its Outlook email and calendar programs.  Artificial intelligence could help Microsoft\u2019s Dynamics business play catch-up to Salesforce.com Inc. To that end, Microsoft is using LinkedIn data to help sales representatives target fertile prospects, critical in the so-called customer-relationship management market that Gartner Inc. estimates hit $39.4 billion last year.  Microsoft has started to infuse Office apps with LinkedIn data about contacts, so meeting attendees learn about one another directly from calendar invitations. The company hopes that level of integration will give its venerable franchise a leg up against Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Gmail.  Applying artificial-intelligence algorithms to LinkedIn data could create new revenue opportunities for Microsoft, said Goldman Sachs & Co. analyst Heather Bellini. \u201cThis is a company that has different ways to monetize than it used to,\u201d she said.  LinkedIn is about to roll out a passel of features aimed at drawing people regularly. For the past year, its engineers have worked on Project Agora, revamping everything from the site\u2019s news feed to the service that lets members message one another.  This spring, LinkedIn will add an \u201cinterest panel\u201d to members\u2019 home pages that will include groups they\u2019ve joined and hashtags they\u2019ve followed\u2014features intended to keep members coming back to learn the latest on topics that matter to them. By summer, LinkedIn will add content from groups into news feeds and notify members of such posts. That way, members will see posts that are related to their interests and won\u2019t be put off by posts from connections with whom they have little in common.  Still, it is a steep challenge to get members to carve out more time for the service, particularly if they turn to LinkedIn only when looking for work or seeking out sales leads, said TJ Keitt, a senior analyst at Forrester Research Inc.  \u201cThere are a ton of people that don\u2019t have an immediate need to engage with it,\u201d Mr. Keitt said.

Mr. Prasad recognizes the challenge of changing people\u2019s perceptions of LinkedIn as just a place to look for new job opportunities. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re under an illusion that it\u2019s going to happen on day one,\u201d he said.

Photo: Drew Angerer/Getty Images  WASHINGTON\u2014Supreme Court justices voiced concern Tuesday that Microsoft Corp.\u2019s MSFT -0.53% resistance to U.S. search warrants for customer emails stored overseas would hamper criminal investigations, in a case that pits leading tech companies against law enforcement.  During an hourlong oral argument, the court considered whether email providers like Microsoft, Yahoo and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s GOOGL -0.12% Google have to comply with warrants if the government is seeking email messages and other digital files that are stored on computer servers outside the U.S.  Several justices said it wasn\u2019t ideal that the case was controlled by a 1986 federal law on electronic records that Congress adopted before email and cloud-computing were part of the social fabric. Still, the court appeared to be searching for a way to interpret the outdated law that wouldn\u2019t rob the government of tools to investigate crimes with a digital trail that crossed U.S. borders.  \u201cThis is what troubles me,\u201d Justice Samuel Alito said. \u201cIt would be good if Congress enacted legislation that modernized this. But in the interim, something has to be done.\u201d  The justices were reviewing a lower-court ruling Microsoft won in 2016 that clipped the Justice Department\u2019s authority to obtain overseas emails. The battle dates back to 2013 when the U.S. got a warrant that ordered Microsoft to hand over messages in an email account that was linked to narcotics trafficking. Microsoft argued the warrant wasn\u2019t valid because the emails were stored in Ireland.  Microsoft lawyer Joshua Rosenkranz argued the 1986 law, called the Stored Communications Act, didn\u2019t allow the U.S. government \u201cto unilaterally reach into a foreign land to search for, copy, and import private customer correspondence\u201d that is stored on a foreign computer and protected by foreign law.  Chief Justice John Roberts, however, said Microsoft was a U.S.-based company and had control over where it chose to store emails and other consumer data.  Newsletter Sign-up  \u201cIt\u2019s not the government\u2019s fault that it\u2019s located overseas,\u201d the chief justice said. He added that if Microsoft prevailed, nothing would prevent the company from moving the emails of U.S. customers to overseas servers to protect their data from disclosure.  \u201cYou might gain customers if you can assure them, no matter what happens, the government won\u2019t be able to get access to their emails,\u201d Chief Justice Roberts said.  Mr. Rosenkranz said such a scenario \u201cwould never happen\u201d because Microsoft relies upon U.S. facilities to provide the best and fastest service to 200 million domestic customers. People who are intent on hiding their correspondence from the government \u201cdon\u2019t use Microsoft\u2019s services,\u201d he said.  Mr. Rosenkranz also warned the court that a win for the government could do serious harm to the U.S. tech sector. \u201cIf you try to tinker with this without the tools that only Congress has, you are as likely to break the cloud as you are to fix it,\u201d he said.  Google, which has waged similar battles with the government, and an array of other leading tech companies are supporting Microsoft in the case.  Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg suggested the wait-for-Congress approach had some appeal.  \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be wiser just to say, \u2018Let\u2019s leave things as they are\u2014if Congress wants to regulate in this brave new world, it should do it\u2019?\u201d Justice Ginsburg asked.  Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah), who attended the oral argument, recently proposed bipartisan legislation to update the law and give law enforcement access to overseas customer data, while also providing protections for email and cloud computing providers. It isn\u2019t clear if, or when, lawmakers may move forward on such a bill.  No justice during Monday\u2019s session clearly embraced Microsoft\u2019s reading of the 1986 law. Nor did the justices echo concerns about customer privacy that have been voiced by the tech industry.  The government noted that investigators would still have to get a warrant to see the emails.  \u201cIt\u2019s not a case about privacy,\u201d Justice Department lawyer Michael Dreeben told the court. \u201cThe government has the gold standard of an instrument to address privacy interests here\u2014a probable-cause-based warrant issued by a judge that describes with particularity what we want.\u201d  Mr. Dreeben said the lower-court ruling in Microsoft\u2019s favor \u201chas caused grave and immediate harm to the government\u2019s ability to enforce federal criminal law.\u201d  A decision is expected by the end of June.

It didn\u2019t last.  Epic said it turned off \u201ccross-play\u201d once it discovered the error, the latest roadblock to a dream feature for gamers that is technologically possible but frustratingly elusive.  The major console makers\u2014Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo Co. \u2014have long supported cross-play between their machines and personal computers, and more recently with mobile devices.  But the three don\u2019t always play well together, creating headaches for friends who own different consoles and game developers who say the block limits the potential to expand their audiences.  Players of \u2018Fortnite,\u2019 by Epic Games, have been vocal about requesting a cross-play feature.

Recently, the friends agreed not to buy a new Capcom Co. game, \u201cMonster Hunter: World,\u201d for their consoles. Instead, they are waiting for it to come out for PCs in the fall so they can play together, Mr. Ross said.  People playing the same game on different hardware can link up online, provided the developer has built software to allow the two systems to talk to each other. But the developer would still need each hardware makers\u2019 blessing.  At around 2 a.m. ET Thursday, more than 600,000 people tuned into Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s Twitch live-streaming platform to watch rapper Drake play \u201cFortnite\u201d on a PlayStation 4 with a popular streamer who was using a PC. The live stream, which handily beat the previous Twitch record for simultaneous viewers on the channel of an individual broadcaster, occurred days after Epic said it would enable both PlayStation 4 and Xbox users to play against people on PCs and mobile devices\u2014though not against each other.  Epic\u2019s announcement prompted a \u201cFortnite\u201d player on Twitter to implore Phil Spencer, Microsoft\u2019s head of games, to add cross-play with Sony\u2019s console. \u201cWe really want cross-play system between XB1 and PS4,\u201d the tweeter said.  \u201cMe 2,\u201d Mr. Spencer tweeted back minutes later.

Sony declined to comment.  It isn\u2019t the first time Sony has been accused of standing in the way. Last year, Psyonix Inc. sought to make its car-soccer game \u201cRocket League\u201d playable across consoles. Microsoft and Nintendo signed up. Sony demurred.  \u201cIt\u2019s extremely frustrating,\u201d Psyonix Chief Executive Dave Hagewood said.  Game developers have good reason to want cross-play, Benchmark Co. analyst Mike Hickey said. \u201cYou\u2019re less likely to go play another game if your buddies are all playing together,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re more engaged, you\u2019re more likely to spend money\u201d on virtual goodies inside the game, he said.  Prohibiting cross-play can be advantageous for a console maker: Shoppers might be inclined to choose the system that friends own, said Piper Jaffray analyst Mike Olson. That tips the scales in favor of the market leader, which right now is Sony\u2019s PlayStation 4.  Microsoft hasn\u2019t always supported cross-play. In 2011, when its Xbox Live service dominated online console games, a company representative told the website Kotaku that Microsoft wasn\u2019t on board, because it couldn\u2019t guarantee players on competing systems would get the same level of quality as on Xbox 360.

The case, set to be heard next month, stems from a dispute between the Justice Department and Microsoft Corp. over access to emails stored on a server in Ireland. Industry officials say it highlights the stark differences between the U.S. and Europe over views on online privacy and the extent of government access to users\u2019 data.  The U.S. government in 2013 obtained a search warrant requiring Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft to hand over email information as part of an investigation into a customer who allegedly was using the account to conduct criminal drug activity.  Microsoft complied with part of the order but rebuffed the request to turn over the email messages, which were stored abroad, arguing that U.S. search warrants don\u2019t reach data stored outside domestic borders. Microsoft argues that complying with the warrant would have meant the company could have run afoul of EU privacy rules.  At issue in the court case are broader questions about who should govern global internet companies, and how. In particular, cloud computing companies, such as Microsoft or Amazon.com Inc., can move data among different servers around the world.  Microsoft says it stores users\u2019 data in the region where a user resides and customers should be in control of their data.  The U.S. argues that its warrant required Microsoft to hand over the information because it can be accessed in the U.S. with the click of a computer mouse, and lack of access to that data could pose significant barriers to ongoing investigations.  \u201cHundreds if not thousands of investigations of crimes\u2014ranging from terrorism, to child pornography, to fraud\u2014are being or will be hampered by the government\u2019s inability to obtain electronic evidence,\u201d the Justice Department said in a court brief.  A U.S. government win in the case could hand U.S. companies operating in Europe an expensive dilemma: either comply with U.S. data requests or risk breaching EU data privacy rules. European companies with business operations in the U.S. also fear they could receive similar requests from American authorities sent to their headquarters abroad.  \u201cThis untenable position would throw a wrench into the countless routine business arrangements that comprise today\u2019s highly interdependent commercial world,\u201d the largest trade organizations from Germany, Ireland, Poland and France said in a joint filing to the court.  Foreign governments can access evidence in Europe for criminal investigations, but the preferred method under EU law is to go directly through member states, as part of what is known as a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty. That approach will be enshrined in the bloc\u2019s new data protection regulation, to enter into force in May. The new rules threaten fines as high as 4% of a firm\u2019s global revenue for failure to comply.  Washington\u2019s position seems to fly in the face of EU sovereignty, some European officials and legal experts said.  \u201cThis can clearly escalate to being a conflict of law and international relations,\u201d said Jan Philipp Albrecht, a Green Party member of the European Parliament and staunch privacy advocate. \u201cThe question [is] if the EU can expect that their own laws apply to their own territory and market or is the U.S. trying to put that into question?\u201d  Companies, governments and institutions in Europe and elsewhere have submitted third-party briefs to the court ahead of the hearing, which is set for February 27. A decision is expected by June.  The U.K., one of the U.S.\u2019s closest law-enforcement allies in Europe, has thrown its weight behind Washington\u2019s arguments in the case. Britain, which is preparing to exit the EU, is also currently negotiating a bilateral treaty with the U.S. over access for law-enforcement purposes to electronic communications held on servers in each other\u2019s jurisdictions.  The case is reminding some Europeans of leaks by one-time National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden disclosing that U.S. tech companies cooperated with the NSA, allowing authorities to access information through a so-called backdoor. Those revelations sowed deep mistrust in Europe of U.S. intelligence practices, straining trans-Atlantic ties and hindering cooperation between Washington and Brussels in other areas.  U.S. tech companies also came under scrutiny from the broader public following the revelations. That is one reason Microsoft is fighting so hard: to maintain its reputation. Microsoft says it has only provided data to the U.S. government under valid legal orders.  \u201cPre-Snowden, this would have been done quietly, there would have been an accommodation\u201d between Microsoft and the government, said James A. Lewis, a senior vice president at the Center for Strategic & International Studies, a Washington-based think tank. \u201cEveryone would have gone away happy.\u201d  Now, \u201cthey need to show the world, their global customer base, that they\u2019re not just going to roll over every time the U.S. government asks them for something,\u201d he said.

But the measure drew widespread criticism from privacy and human-rights activists, who suggested U.S. tech companies\u2014under pressure in Washington\u2014had retreated on the issue. They also suggested the bill could leave data stored in the U.S. vulnerable to demands by authoritarian foreign governments.  The measure, known as the Cloud Act, would create a legal framework for resolving the frequent conflicts that have sprung up recently over the issue.  It would amend U.S. law to make clear that law-enforcement warrants can apply to data that U.S.-based tech companies store anywhere in the world. But the act also would give companies a right to challenge warrants in court based on privacy laws in the specific country where the data are stored.  It also would allow for bilateral agreements between the U.S. and other countries over how to deal with disputes in the future, including other countries\u2019 requests for data in the U.S.  The issue has come up more frequently in recent years, as big U.S. tech companies have stored more data overseas. One problem fueling the conflicts is that the 1986 federal law in question, the Stored Communications Act, is ill-suited to current cross-border data-storage practices.  In one case pending before the Supreme Court, a federal appeals court sided with Microsoft Corp. in holding that warrants for customer data can\u2019t be enforced on U.S. providers if the data are stored overseas.  The Justice Department and state attorneys general say the lower-court ruling has hindered investigations into an array of crimes, from narcotics trafficking to arson to child pornography. Electronic evidence is now critical to virtually every criminal investigation, they say.  But Microsoft, Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google unit and other technology companies have argued the Justice Department\u2019s position would leave them caught in the middle between U.S. law-enforcement demands and their obligation to abide by privacy laws in foreign jurisdictions.  The Justice Department applied for a warrant requiring Microsoft to turn over email information from an account allegedly tied to illegal drug activity in the U.S. Microsoft handed over some account data that were stored in the U.S. but said it shouldn\u2019t have to hand over the emails, which were stored on a server in Ireland.  The companies say the case ultimately could threaten American dominance in the $250 billion cloud-computing industry, because foreign clients won\u2019t use U.S. firms if their data aren\u2019t protected.  The enactment of the Cloud legislation might leave little for the Supreme Court to decide in the Microsoft case. When the court heard oral arguments in February, multiple justices said congressional intervention would be welcome.  \"It would be good if Congress enacted legislation that modernized this,\u201d Justice Samuel Alito said.  Tech groups criticized the new measure\u2019s implications for privacy in several respects, casting it as a surrender of sorts in the wake of the Microsoft case.  \"The Cloud Act is a disappointing outcome after so many human-rights groups weighed in on the Microsoft case at the U.S. Supreme Court,\u201d said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center.  EPIC and other groups had pushed for many updates to the 1980s-era privacy law, he said, \u201cbut they were ignored.\u201d Greg Nojeim of the Center for Democracy and Technology said the deal gives the Justice Department too much leeway to open up U.S. data to authoritarian foreign governments.  \u201cDOJ could use this legislation to diminish privacy rights world-wide, or to persuade other governments to raise their surveillance standards in order to qualify for an agreement,\u201c he said. \u201dWe fear the U.S. Congress hasn\u2019t done enough to require DOJ to make the right decisions.\u201d  \u201cThe internet industry applauds Congress for including the Cloud Act in the omnibus spending bill,\u201d said Melika Carroll, a senior vice president for the Internet Association, a trade group representing big tech companies. \u201cIt\u2019s critical that we modernize U.S. privacy laws to reflect current realities of how data is stored around the world. Passing the Cloud Act will enable law enforcement to gather data stored abroad for the purposes of investigating serious crimes, while still protecting individual privacy rights.\u201d  \u2014Brent Kendall contributed to this article.

The tax is due regardless of whether they bring it home or not, though companies may choose to pay it over eight years. Businesses must generally book this tax as a one-time charge in the final quarter of 2017. Apple said this month it would pay $38 billion in taxes and return the majority of its overseas cash to the U.S.  The taxes companies pay on these profits will vary somewhat, depending on both the size of the profits and how they have been invested. Companies must pay 15.5% on liquid assets, such as cash and a variety of marketable securities, and 8% on other assets. Technology companies tend to have a larger amount of liquid assets as a share of their overseas stockpile than other industries: For instance, 95% of networking giant Cisco Systems Inc.\u2019s accumulated foreign profit last year was in cash and cash equivalents, versus 22% for retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc.  The Wall Street Journal estimated that 311 large publicly traded companies could generate nearly $250 billion in these taxes, of which 38% could be paid by tech companies.  Tax rates  Tech giants generally enjoy low effective tax rates because a portion of their profits accumulate in low-tax foreign jurisdictions. Tech firms paid an average tax rate of 24% over the 10-year period through 2016, below the 29% average tax rate for all companies in the S&P 500 for that period and lower than any other industry, according to an analysis of corporate filings by Zion Research Group.

That means firms like Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Cisco Systems, which over the past decade have paid lower tax rates on average than the new statutory rate of 21%, may soon see their rates go up. International Business Machines Inc., which paid a tax rate of 12% last year excluding one-time benefits, said this month its rate will rise to as much as 18% in 2018.  The five biggest tech companies\u2014 Apple Inc., Alphabet, Microsoft Corp. , Amazon.com Inc. and Facebook Inc. \u2014all report earnings this week and investors will be looking for guidance on tax rates.  Use of capital  Now that companies are free to bring foreign cash to the U.S. at no added cost, they will be dogged with the question of how they plan to spend it. Tech firms are already among the biggest spenders on research and development and on acquisitions. Adding to these budgets may not be the answer.

Will we see share buybacks? Maybe not, because share prices are so high at the moment.\u201d  Borrowing  With most of their cash sitting offshore, tech giants have increasingly issued debt to finance their growth and return money to shareholders. Tech firms in the S&P 500 collectively held nearly $566 billion in long-term debt in the most recent quarter, more than three times the amount they held just five years ago. That is a faster pace of growth than any other sector.  Racking Up Debt Tech companies acquired debt at a faster pace than any other sector in the S&P 500 over the last five years.

It provides Fourth Amendment safeguards to prevent unreasonable searches of electronically stored communications \u2014 but says nothing about data held abroad.  The Court of Appeals concluded that the Stored Communications Act was not intended by Congress to allow searches outside the country. The ruling followed the well-established principle that American courts generally do not apply United States law beyond its borders unless Congress intended so.  But at least four federal courts have since refused to follow the ruling, mostly for practical, technology-driven reasons. The cases before those courts involved Google and Yahoo, which store data \u201cdynamically\u201d \u2014 breaking data into many small pieces and constantly shuttling it among storage centers in various countries to optimize performance and network efficiency. The text of an email might reside in Bulgaria, but the attachment in Spain.  Does it make any sense to think of this email as located in a specific country overseas? As a United States District Court judge, Juan R. S\u00e1nchez, wrote in an opinion that rejected the Second Circuit\u2019s ruling, \u201cno one knows which country to ask\u201d for the data.  Because Microsoft still frequently uses local-based storage, the Supreme Court case, though important, is of limited significance. The court has an opportunity to clarify the scope of the Stored Communications Act with respect to data stored \u201cstatically\u201d outside the United States. (When signing up for service, a Microsoft user indicates his or her country of residence and Microsoft usually stores the user\u2019s data in a nearby data center.) But the case does not address the more general question of the legal standards that govern information that crosses borders \u2014 and in particular, data stored \u201cdynamically.\u201d  Only Congress can address that larger question, by writing an urgently needed new law. (Even the Second Circuit appealed to Congress to step in.) The International Communications Privacy Act, introduced last term in Congress, is a good place to start. It provides a framework by which United States law enforcement can obtain communications of both United States and foreign citizens, consistent with the privacy protections afforded by international law.  The guiding principle should be that the reach of any new law is defined by the citizenship and geographical location of the individual whose data the government seeks, rather the physical location of the data. This would allow for the right balance between global privacy rights and the needs of United States law enforcement.  No matter how the Microsoft case is decided, if Congress fails to act, we will continue to have a legal system that inadequately governs the vast stores of electronic data that move seamlessly across international borders.", "stock": "MSFT", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-26", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/26/opinion/united-states-searching-data-overseas.html"}, {"article": "BEIJING (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc\u2019s (GOOGL.O) Google said on Tuesday it has made \u201cno changes\u201d to its mapping platform in China, denying an earlier media report that claimed it was re-launching the function in China, where many of its services are blocked.

Tesla said a week after the accident that vehicle logs showed no action had been taken by the driver right before the crash and that he had received earlier warnings to put his hands on the wheel.

Trump\u2019s order, signed into law on Tuesday, imposes a 30 percent tariff on fully assembled imported solar panels as well as the cells of which the panels are made - a move intended to protect American jobs but which the solar industry worries will raise costs and trigger thousands of layoffs.  But in a twist destined to help the California company, the solar cell tariff only kicks in after 2.5 gigawatts worth hit U.S. shores each year.  Tesla uses solar cells in its nascent solar roof tile business. The tiles generate electricity without the need for a traditional panel. Tesla also has plans to build conventional panels using imported cells for its U.S.-based residential installation business, which it also hopes to grow over the coming years.  Tesla said on Tuesday it expects to be able to import \u201csome or all of our non-U.S. cells for Solar Roof and solar panel modules free of tariffs.\u201d  Only 500 MW worth of solar cells were imported into the United States in total last year, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, a fifth of what is being exempted from Trump\u2019s tariff.  Baird analyst Ben Kallo agreed the tariff was generally positive for Tesla as it will make its domestic products more competitive with imports - though he noted its installation business will pay higher prices for imported panels in the short term. Tesla shares rose $1.23, or 0.3 percent, to close at $352.79 on Tuesday.  Tesla had been part of a group of domestic manufacturers that lobbied against tariffs on solar products.

During that meeting, Bitran said he had proposed a project to Tesla in which SQM would provide brine, the raw material from which lithium is produced, to the carmaker for refining into battery component lithium hydroxide in Chile.  \u201cWhat we said is that we would be willing to negotiate additional quota to make this possible,\u201d said Bitran, referencing the meeting.

Tesla shares opened up as much as 6.9 percent and rose 3.6 percent to $261.53 as of 10:52 a.m., regaining some ground after a 22 percent slump in March.  The lower-than-expected deliveries and production will intensify the debate over Musk\u2019s ability to deliver on his quest to bring electric cars to the masses. Mounting liquidity pressures and challenges with Model 3 production prompted Moody\u2019s Investors Service last week to cut the carmaker\u2019s credit rating further into junk status, adding fuel to a selloff of the company\u2019s bonds to all-time lows.  Capital Buffer  Heading into the production results, analysts at Jefferies Group LLC and Moody\u2019s had estimated that Tesla may need to raise $2 billion to $3 billion in capital to continue to ramp up Model 3 output.

Tesla.  Does Elon Musk control Tesla Inc.? Colloquially speaking, sure he does: He is Tesla's chief executive officer, the chairman of its board and its largest shareholder. He is also its co-founder, even though he didn't found it, which is a hard trick to pull off at a company that you don't control.  But there is also a narrower question, which is: Is Elon Musk the controlling shareholder of Tesla? That is less obvious. He owns about 22 percent of the stock, which is rather less than a majority, and it's all just normal stock, with no super-voting rights or anything. This narrower question matters because, under Delaware law (Tesla is a Delaware company), there are limits on what a controlling shareholder can do to enrich himself at the expense of a company that he controls. For instance, when Tesla acquired SolarCity Corp. in 2016, when Musk was SolarCity's chairman and largest shareholder (and his cousin was its CEO), and when SolarCity was financially troubled and needed to be bailed out by someone, that looked, to a lot of people, like kind of an awkward transaction.  But Delaware law does not have a category for \"kind of an awkward transaction.\" It has basically two relevant categories: If Musk was the controlling shareholder of Tesla, and caused Tesla to buy SolarCity, then a judge will review the transaction for \"entire fairness\" and, if he finds that the process or price was unfair, he can award damages for shareholders against Musk and the directors. But if Musk was not the controlling shareholder -- if he was just a CEO who happened to own some shares, and who was answerable to the board of directors and shareholders -- then the board's decision to buy SolarCity is subject to \"business judgment\" review, which basically means that the board can do whatever it wants. (Also even if he was the controlling shareholder, he could have avoided entire fairness review \"if at the outset of a self-dealing transaction the controlling stockholder effectively relinquished control over the outcome to an independent committee of disinterested directors and a nonwaivable, fully informed vote of a majority of the minority stockholders.\")  So is he the controlling shareholder? Yesterday a Delaware judge ruled on a motion to dismiss a shareholder lawsuit over the SolarCity deal and decided that it's a \"close call\" but that Musk might have controlled Tesla, so the lawsuit can go forward. The reasons for Musk's control are all the sort of obvious things: He owns a lot of shares, not a majority but enough to sway the vote; he dominates the board of directors and, in particular, dominated the board's discussion of the proposed SolarCity deal (bringing it to the board three times, and curiously never discussing the possibility of buying another solar company instead of SolarCity); he \"has demonstrated a willingness to facilitate the ouster of senior management when displeased\"; and he is central to the company's business, raising money for it and acting as its public face and authoring its \"Master Plan.\" (And while Tesla did require a majority of the non-Musk shareholders to approve the deal, and allowed independent directors to negotiate the price -- which I thought was rather good governance, considering -- Musk was fully involved in the board decisions about whether to do the deal.) You can't really object too much to that conclusion. Intuitively, Tesla is Musk's company, while also being a public company, and using a public company you control to bail out another public company that you also control seems like the sort of thing that controlling-shareholder rules are supposed to be suspicious of.  Still it's a little weird. Musk is the charismatic founder-CEO-visionary of Tesla, sure. But he owns 22 percent of the shares, with 22 percent of the vote. Plenty of other tech-company founder-CEO-visionaries have found much stronger ways to formalize their perpetual control. Mark Zuckerberg owns about 16 percent of the shares of Facebook Inc., but he controls almost 60 percent of the vote, and almost got the company to give him voting control forever even if he sells more of his stock. Evan Spiegel and Robert Murphy are the charismatic founder-visionaries of Snap Inc.; they own less than 40 percent of the stock between them, but control more than 88 percent of the vote. Meanwhile, just being a founder-CEO-visionary who dominates the board, has the ideas, and is the public face of the company is not necessarily enough to keep control, as Travis Kalanick can tell you. The voting power usually doesn't matter, when things are good for the founder-CEO-visionary, but when it matters it matters.  There seem to be two models of governance in large technology companies run by founder-visionaries: There is the founder-visionary-CEO as perpetual owner and controlling shareholder, who jealously guards his rights so that he can't be unseated by insurgent shareholders or directors, and there is the founder-visionary-CEO who actually does give shareholders a vote, and who relies on his charisma and vision to keep the shareholders and directors in line. Those models often come to more or less the same place, but they don't always; Musk has to wake up every day and persuade his shareholders and directors that his charismatic vision is the right one, in a way that Zuckerberg just doesn't. It's a little rough on Musk that he's not actually the controlling shareholder and the law treats him like he is anyway.  In other Tesla news, its bonds are cratering. \"You can see quickly that Tesla is singularly unsuited to using debt,\" wrote Aswath Damodaran back in August, when it was issuing debt. But \"bond investors pretty much ignored the carmaker\u2019s prolific cash burn and repeated failures to meet production targets and lent it $1.8 billion at record-low interest rates.\" I guess investors saw the unsuitability slowly: The bonds \"plunged to a low of 86 cents on the dollar\" yesterday, and Moody's Investors Service downgraded them to a Caa1 rating this week. I have to say that as I spend time this month reading financial-crisis anniversary pieces, I cannot get that worked up about a low-junk-rated money-losing company's bonds trading down to a 7.8 percent yield. As these things go, that's still pretty good.  A warning shot.  How are things at Deutsche Bank AG? Oh great, great, except that it has been widely reported that Chairman Paul Achleitner has grown tired of Chief Executive Officer John Cryan and is openly searching for his replacement. Yesterday Cryan sent out a staff memo saying that he is \"absolutely committed\" to staying, which is not quite the question that was being asked:  \u201cThe fact that Cryan must write his own defense and doesn\u2019t get any backing from Achleitner is a sign of weakness for the CEO,\u201d said Florian Sauerburger, a portfolio manager at Aramea Asset Management, which owns Deutsche Bank stock.  It's true. It rather seems like the intended audience for the memo was Achleitner and the board, and that its message was \"back off.\" \"We need to focus on executing on the strategy that was agreed and signed off by both the management and supervisory boards,\" wrote Cryan, who mentioned the \"destabilizing effect\" of \"widespread rumors\" and urged, \"Let\u2019s not allow ourselves to be thrown off course.\" They're all employee-appropriate sentiments, I guess, but also interpretable as an argument that the noisy search for his replacement should quiet down. Meanwhile there is this:  The person close to Mr Achleitner stressed that replacing Mr Cryan \u201cis not a foregone conclusion at this point\u201d, adding that the chief executive should take the debate as \u201ca warning shot\u201d and redouble efforts to cut costs.  Is that a thing? Is it normal for a board of directors to go around noisily auditioning replacements for their CEO in order to light a fire under the incumbent? It seems rather tough for the incumbent's authority, not to mention his morale. Anyway as long as Cryan is still around he is going to do what he does, which is make cuts at the investment bank, though there too Deutsche seems to be of two minds about everything:  As part of the investment bank review, cuts are being discussed at both big trading businesses -- equities as well as fixed income, currencies and commodities -- because they are expensive and haven\u2019t performed well, said one person. However, the extent of a potential retrenchment is unclear because many traders just got big bonuses in an effort to retain top performers, this person said.  I have to say that getting a big retention bonus and then immediately being laid off is ... not the worst way to go.  The crypto.  Here is a profile of Zhao Changpeng, the founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance, who spent \"several years developing trading systems for companies including Bloomberg L.P.,\" and who is now maybe a billionaire, but who has apparently never met a lawyer? Or something, I don't know, what do you make of this explanation for why Binance lists so many initial coin offerings that have characteristics of unregistered securities:  Zhao said the exchange\u2019s client identification policies are similar to those of some U.S.-based venues and that Binance takes a venture capital-like approach to evaluating the coins it lists, favoring those that are backed by teams with a track record and real products. He also asks issuers to provide Binance with a legal opinion that the coins aren\u2019t securities.  Look. The way venture capital works is that it invests in companies, specifically by buying securities of those companies. If you evaluate coins by examining their team and their products using a \"venture capital-like approach,\" that is because they are companies and they are issuing securities.  Also I have a feeling we should check in on this guy in six months:  \u201cThe less regulation, the better,\u201d said Zachary Ising, a 24-year-old graduate student at California University of Pennsylvania who relies on virtual currency trading for all his income and has a majority of his assets in a Binance account. \u201cI\u2019m confident in Binance\u2019s ability to secure its own platform.\u201d  Elsewhere: \"Russia says Venezuela has not offered to repay debts in cryptocurrency.\" And: \"Reddit Disables Bitcoin Payments.\" Honestly I didn't know that you could pay for Reddit, but if I had known that you could pay for Reddit, I'd have been pretty confident that you could pay for Reddit with Bitcoin. Now you can't.  Blockchain blockchain blockchain.  Here is \"Blockchain Technology for Corporate Governance and Shareholder Activism\" by Anne Lafarre and Christoph Van der Elst. \"Shares are usually held through complex chains of intermediaries,\" they write, and \"these intermediaries not only add transaction costs to shareholder participation per se, there is also high uncertainty that information, including the record of shareholder votes, is correctly channelled between ultimate shareholders and companies in remote participation.\" The solution is of course the blockchain:  In a private blockchain, managed by the company only accessible for shareholders for example on the Hyperledger of IBM, the company and shareholders that hold sufficient shares can place proposals. Smart contracting allows for the private ledger to be structured so that all relevant information including majority rules and access rights that are contained in the articles of association and the law are taken into account. Once a certain proposal is placed in the blockchain, shareholders that hold shares in the company are immediately notified and can exercise their voting rights during a short period. The voting results may become instantly available after a cut-off point, and majority requirements, necessary to render the decision binding and verifiable, need to be reached in a specified timeframe. Shareholders can verify their own transactions, but none of the shareholders should be able to determine what voting decision was taken by other shareholders.  Look, you know, fine. We have talked about exactly these problems -- the complex chain of intermediation in stock voting that leads to uncertainty and reduced participation -- and in fact I have even gone so far as to mutter the word \"blockchain\" in those discussions. But what if you replaced the word \"blockchain\" in the paragraph above with a word like, say, \"website\"? What if the company had a private website where it could put proposals, and a database where it tracked share ownership, and the shareholders could log in to the website and see and vote on proposals? The call here is for a private blockchain -- one administered by the company -- so the trustlessness and decentralization benefits of public blockchains are not relevant. This is just an argument that companies should have better databases for tracking their shareholders, and better user interfaces to allow those shareholders to vote their shares. The blockchain has nothing to do with it, except that people want to read about the blockchain.  Elsewhere, some of the people who piloted blockchain projects realized they were pointless:  DTCC, known as Wall Street\u2019s bookkeeper, recently put the brakes on a blockchain system for the clearing and settlement of repurchase, or repo, agreement transactions, said Murray Pozmanter, head of clearing agency services at the DTCC. The project, which had successfully tested with startup Digital Asset Holdings (DA), was shelved because banks and other potential users believed the same results could be achieved more cheaply using current technology, he said. \u201cBasically, it became a solution in search of a problem,\u201d he said.  Yes! The blockchain project worked! But also so would a database run by a trusted central counterparty such as, just to throw one name out there, DTCC. You could just about imagine someone, somewhere, saying \"the blockchain is a solution to the problem that we rely too much on DTCC to clear and settle repo trades.\" (I mean, it seems like a niche thing to worry about, but you could.) It is harder to imagine DTCC concluding that. And if DTCC is going to run a centralized blockchain, why not just run a centralized database instead?  Virtual reality.  Are we currently living in a computer simulation run for the entertainment or edification of some far more intelligent beings? Sure, why not. I have to say that the best evidence for it is that when people come up with virtual-reality projects, the reality always seems to be so grimly literal. Microsoft Corp., for instance, developed \"a digital room where we could sit at a digital desk and interact with Microsoft programs such as Word,\" which sounds a whole lot like the actual rooms at my house and my office where I sit at an actual desk and interact with Word. And if a virtual-reality desk job isn't quite existentially terrifying enough for you, now you can virtually die at your virtual-reality desk:  Visitors could don VR glasses and earphones to experience having a seizure at work, a failed paramedic rescue, and entrance into the afterlife. Funeral parlor employee Dong Ziyi told The Beijing News that the immersive experience \u201cenables people to better cherish the beauty of life.\u201d  Now we just need a virtual-reality experience of eating lunch at your desk. We really are building all the components of virtual-reality life, and death, under late capitalism. I would na\u00efvely have thought that people would build virtual reality experiences that are, you know, fun, that you can't really get in your daily life. As opposed to, like, \"do some word processing and then die at your desk.\" But I guess the fact that our simulated reality is so much like our boring reality is an argument that our boring reality is itself a simulation.

A string of executives have headed for the exits, including a surprising number from the company\u2019s finance team, as Tesla is dogged by questions about whether it can meet its production targets.  The chief financial officer left abruptly last year in a curious turn of events, where he was replaced by his predecessor: Deepak Ahuja served as Tesla\u2019s CFO from 2008 to 2015 and then took over the job again in March 2017, according to his LinkedIn. Then late last year, one of Tesla\u2019s audit committee members, Steve Jurvetson, went on leave from the board (following accusations of misconduct, which he has denied). The vice president of business development and director of battery technology both left in the past year. Jon McNeill, one of Tesla\u2019s most senior executives, went to take the chief operating officer job at Lyft Inc. last month. Eric Branderiz, Tesla\u2019s chief accounting officer, departed last week. And Bloomberg reported this week that Susan Repo, the corporate treasurer and vice president of finance, is out.  The press has rightly been focused on trying to figure out how badly Tesla will miss its production targets for the all-important Model 3 electric sedan. After all, actually building cars is pretty important to Tesla\u2019s business.  Bloomberg built a Tesla Model 3 Tracker. The data show Tesla is producing approximately 737 cars a week. In July, Tesla predicted that it would produce 5,000 Model 3s a week by the end of 2017. Oops.  Tesla has steadily rolled back its production targets and still looks like it will be behind schedule. According to Bloomberg\u2019s analysis, Tesla Model 3 output has actually slowed from February when it was producing something like 936 Model 3s a week. My colleague Dana Hull reported that Tesla temporarily suspended production in late February, potentially explaining the slowdown.  CNBC reported Wednesday that many of the vehicles coming off Tesla\u2019s assembly line required more work. One employee estimated that \u201c40 percent of the parts made or received at its Fremont factor require work,\u201d the article said. Some investors surely found Tesla\u2019s response to the article to be laughable. The company\u2019s statement reads, \u201cIn what world is the pursuit of perfection looked down on? Not one we want to live in.\u201d  Ah yes, a story about how Tesla is producing cars in an inefficient fashion is really about a company with high standards.  On Thursday, the Wall Street Journal declared it \u201cTesla\u2019s Make-Or-Break Moment.\u201d That article rightly points out that Tesla had $3.4 billion of cash at the end of 2017 and that last year it burned $1 billion a quarter. Do the math, and Tesla either needs to generate more revenue or raise more money soon.  The Journal\u2019s story observes that Tesla has a so-called Z-Score (a measure of a company\u2019s financial security) of 1.26. \u201cAny company with a score below 1.8 is considered distressed by many investors. A score of 1.0 or lower suggests bankruptcy is likely within two years,\u201d Tim Higgins and Susan Pulliam write.  The financial markets have given Tesla a long leash, but the evidence against the viability of its business continues to mount. About 23 percent of publicly traded Tesla stock is being used to bet against the automaker. That\u2019s a lot of short sellers.  Of course, Chanos has been warning against Tesla since at least October 2016. \u201cThe whole thing is just sort of this m\u00e9lange of publicly traded and privately traded science projects gone awry. So we\u2019ll see how it works out,\u201d he said at the time. Despite his years-long bets against the company, the stock has been climbing. The Tesla Hype Train keeps going.  But I have to end this piece with a necessary caveat. Despite cash flow concerns, Musk\u2019s companies have generally worked out for investors. Peter Thiel issued what has become a sort of Silicon Valley koan: \u201cNever bet against Elon.\u201d  This article also ran in Bloomberg Technology\u2019s Fully Charged newsletter. Sign up here.

The safety agency has not yet decided whether it will open a formal investigation of the crash, NTSB spokesman Chris O\u2019Neil said in an email. The safety board only investigates a handful of highway accidents each year.  The Tesla\u2019s driver said he had the vehicle\u2019s Autopilot driver-assist system engaged when it struck a firetruck at around 65 miles per hour, a union for Culver City, California firefighters said in a tweet on Monday. \"Amazingly there were no injuries!

Tesla said in a statement that Autopilot is \u201cintended for use only with a fully attentive driver.\u201d The company said it has taken steps to educate drivers about the need to keep their hands on the steering wheel and be prepared to take over from Autopilot, which it calls an \"advanced driver assistance system\" that is not intended to turn the vehicle into an autonomous car.  The NTSB has previously said Tesla\u2019s Autopilot system was a contributing factor in a 2016 fatal crash in Florida. In that incident, a Model S driver died after the car drove underneath a semi-trailer crossing a divided road that the Autopilot\u2019s sensors failed to detect.  The NTSB criticized Tesla and other carmakers for measuring whether a driver is paying attention using steering wheel movement in a September report about the fatal 2016 Tesla crash involving Autopilot.

Shares of the Japanese company plunged as much as 9 percent after a spate of Tesla bad-news stories over the past few weeks. First, the U.S. electric-car maker reported yet another fatal crash, then a shortfall in production targets for its mass-market Model 3 and to top it off, a rating downgrade by Moody's Investors Service on liquidity concerns. The cost to insure Panasonic's five-year debt -- a broad gauge of risk -- has risen sharply.  That Panasonic is dancing to Tesla's tune is no big surprise -- it usually does. Investors have long seen the electronics giant as a derivative play on its U.S. customer. Their thesis: more Teslas, more batteries. To be fair, Panasonic does have solid battery technology -- better than the likes of Samsung SDI Co. -- and has focused its efforts on the auto industry. In fact, moments of weakness in Panasonic stock are often seen as an opportune time to buy. This time, there are other factors to consider.  Out of Sync Panasonic risks putting too many eggs in one basket Bloomberg  First, the level of Panasonic's reliance. The Osaka-based company revised down its sales and operating profit estimates for rechargeable batteries for the full fiscal year in February because it had to push out sales plans in North America to \u201cfuture periods.\u201d Its hyped-up gigafactory partnership with Tesla in Nevada has undershot expectations. Panasonic is piling capex into the $5 billion project, in part raising debt to do so. Moody's expects the company to shovel more than 50 percent of its capital spending into the automotive segment including battery plants.  Besides Tesla, Panasonic leans heavily on the broader electric-vehicle industry, where prospects are dimming amid the Trump administration's lackluster interest in green policies. Earlier this month, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it was revising fuel-efficiency standards that allow carmakers \"to make cars that people both want and can afford.\" That damped enthusiasm for the potential growth of electric cars.  Then, there's China, the world's largest electric-vehicle market. Panasonic, along with other foreign battery makers, risks being shut out by new-energy policies aimed at cornering the global market. China's own battery champion, Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., is shoving global competitors aside as it ramps up production and pushes down prices, while reaching standards to supply the likes of BMW AG.  Panasonic started making batteries for hybrid cars in the northeastern city of Dalian only last month, entering a market that's increasingly looking saturated as growing volumes put pressure on margins. Tesla, meanwhile, which sells in China only through exports, may also be at risk of being drawn into the ongoing trade spat with the U.S.  Ahead of the Pack Panasonic trades at a premium to its South Korea battery maker peers Bloomberg  Panasonic stock is down around 7 percent this year in Tokyo and trades at a premium to its South Korean battery peers on 14.4 times forward earnings.

Tesla Inc. installed 87 megawatts of commercial and residential solar in the fourth quarter, including about 50 megawatts at homes, according to a GTM Research estimate. Rival Sunrun Inc. added 85 megawatts of residential systems in the same period, according to a statement Tuesday. Counting only that part of Tesla\u2019s operation, Sunrun took the lead in the third quarter.  The changing of the guard comes more than a year after Tesla bought Musk\u2019s debt-burdened SolarCity for $2 billion. Tesla has since prioritized profitability in solar over growth-at-all-costs as the company seeks to transform itself into a solar and battery giant to complement its electric vehicles. Tesla has ceded solar market-share in most quarters since that deal, and without SolarCity trumpeting solar, the U.S. residential market contracted in 2017 after at least 16 consecutive years of growth.  \u201cSolarCity was the marketing and lobbying machine for the entire industry, and everyone is struggling in its absence,\u201d said Hugh Bromley, a New York-based analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance.

The unprecedented pay package has been criticized as too costly by proxy adviser Glass Lewis & Co., which has recommended that investors reject the plan.

Each tranche equals about 1 percent of Tesla\u2019s outstanding shares. The company\u2019s market value has to reach $650 billion for the award to fully vest -- roughly a 12-fold increase.  Musk Dependence  Musk\u2019s star power has helped vault Tesla to an almost $55 billion market capitalization, exceeding the value of General Motors Co. or Ford Motor Co. While the company has struggled to mass-manufacture cars including the new Model 3 sedan, he\u2019s convinced investors to buy into his vision of consumers converting to electric vehicles in droves.  Tesla lists its dependence on Musk as a risk factor in securities filings, and some analysts and short sellers have raised concern that the carmaker could run into trouble because of the amount of attention he devotes to other ventures including rocket company Space Exploration Technologies Corp.  \u201cI expect to remain CEO for the foreseeable future,\u201d Musk said during Tesla\u2019s earnings call in February. \u201cThere are no plans to make a change at this time.\u201d  Tesla without Elon wouldn\u2019t be the same company, said Joel Grant, an automotive and industrial analyst at T.

The unprecedented pay package proposes Musk won\u2019t get paid unless his company\u2019s stock rises, further tying the 46-year-old chief executive officer\u2019s personal wealth to that of shareholders. It envisions a staggering increase in market value to $650 billion that would put Tesla in the league of tech giants like Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp., now more than 10 times its size. Revenue would expand to $175 billion, ahead of General Motors Co.  The move assures investors that Musk will lead Tesla through its next phase of rapid growth despite his many other commitments and interests. He is also the CEO of Space Exploration Technologies Corp. and has embarked on several other ventures including OpenAI, Neuralink and the Boring Co.  Under the plan, which requires shareholder approval in March, Musk\u2019s pay is tied strictly to stock performance and profit. He will receive no salary or bonus. A 10-year grant of stock options vests in 12 tranches that are linked to market capitalization in $50 billion increments, starting at $100 billion. There are also milestones tied to revenue and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, Tesla said in a statement.  Musk Payday 10-year pay plan means CEO could bag $56 billion -- theoretically Source: Tesla  Musk, who is already Tesla\u2019s biggest shareholder, has a net worth estimated at $21.5 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The new pay plan would add as much as $55.8 billion to that total. The company said that figure was theoretical, given the likelihood of additional employee stock awards, as well as the possibility of mergers or raising new capital.  \u201cWhile Tesla has no way of predicting how much dilution there will be, some amount of future dilution is a certainty,\u201d the company said in a filing.  The agreement requires Musk to remain as Tesla\u2019s CEO or serve as executive chairman and chief product officer -- potentially paving the way for the company to eventually hire another CEO. The plan is aimed at ensuring that Musk \u201cwill continue to lead Tesla\u2019s management over the long-term while also providing the flexibility to bring in another CEO who would report to Elon at some point in the future,\u201d the company said.  Tesla, based in Palo Alto, California, has more than 33,000 employees worldwide and recently launched the Model 3 sedan, a more affordable electric car that is the linchpin to the company\u2019s efforts to reach the mass market and profitability. Tesla, which has struggled to ramp up production of the car, no longer includes vehicle output targets in Musk\u2019s proposed compensation plan.  The company, whose stated mission \u201c is to accelerate the world\u2019s transition to sustainable energy,\u201d also sells its batteries to utilities seeking to integrate renewable forms of energy like solar and wind onto the grid. That product line is expanding to include a solar roof product for homeowners. Musk\u2019s personal brand as a futurist is deeply intertwined with the identity of the company, which has legions of fans and devoted customers but has yet to make an annual profit.  Musk\u2019s previous compensation plan was also tied to stock performance and vehicle development targets set in 2012. The carmaker was valued at $59.1 billion at the close of trading Monday. The shares have jumped 13 percent since the start of the year.

The problem is that a key to its future battery manufacturing is still in Germany.  The electric-car maker -- which still plans to make about 2,500 of the cars a week by the end of March -- designed a new automated system for module production at its battery factory near Reno, Nevada. The line is already working at Tesla\u2019s German manufacturing unit Grohmann but needs to be shipped to the U.S. next month to be put to use, Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said.  \u201cThat\u2019s got to be disassembled, brought over to the Gigafactory, and re-assembled and then brought into operation at the Gigafactory. It\u2019s not a question of whether it works or not. It\u2019s just a question of disassembly, transport and reassembly,\u201d he said on a conference call Wednesday. Once that milestone is completed, Tesla will next need to fix material-handling constraints at its Fremont, California, assembly plant before it can reach its goal to make 5,000 Model 3 sedans a week by the end of June.  Tesla has pushed back targets several times for Model 3, the more affordable car it\u2019s banking on to propel it from niche electric-car maker to more of a mass manufacturer. The slower production ramp has meant less money is coming in the door from customers taking delivery, and Wall Street is watching closely for any signs the targets could slip again.  Tesla shares fell 8.6 percent to $315.23 on Thursday in New York, the biggest one-day drop since June 2016.  Positive News  Other aspects of Tesla\u2019s latest quarterly loss were more positive. The company\u2019s cash balance barely budged in the last three months of the year even as it struggled to make Model 3 sedans.  Paying customers are supporting Tesla through its production struggle -- they\u2019ve put down more than $850 million in deposits for vehicles including the Semi truck and Roadster sports car Musk showed off in November.  \u201cThe business is complex, and there\u2019s almost always something for bears to focus on. But in Q4, we think most of the news was positive,\u201d Piper Jaffray analyst Alexander Potter wrote in a report.  While it\u2019s going to take time to get Model 3 production to targeted levels, the chief executive officer of both Tesla and Space Exploration Technologies Corp. has succeeded in captivating consumers in the meantime. Musk\u2019s latest promotional stunt involved firing off a sports car into the sky atop the world\u2019s most powerful rocket.  \u201cIf we can send a Roadster to the asteroid belt, we can probably solve Model 3 production,\u201d Musk said on the conference call with analysts, shortly after tweeting another photo of his Roadster hurtling through space.  Unconventional Fundraising Tesla's customer deposits jumped in fourth quarter amid Semi truck, Roadster reveals Source: Company statements  Tesla has said it\u2019s putting off spending to double its production rate to 10,000 Model 3s until it reaches the 5,000 unit milestone. It also deferred some Model 3-related capital expenditures in the fourth quarter, which \u201cdressed up the cash flow,\u201d Cowen\u2019s Osborne said.  A closely watched figure indicating how much money Tesla is using up -- negative free cash flow -- was just $277 million in the fourth quarter, the lowest in more than a year.  Easing Concerns  \u201cAll the cash concerns will be alleviated once they get these cars on the road,\u201d said Tasha Keeney, an analyst at ARK Investment Management, which holds Tesla stock.  Tesla is still far from being in the clear with regards to cash. The company finished the fourth quarter with about $3.4 billion, and it\u2019s planning slightly more than $3.4 billion in capital expenditures this year after spending that much in 2017.  Some of the expenditures planned for this year are linked to what\u2019s coming next to Tesla\u2019s lineup. In addition to the Semi going into production in 2019 and the Roadster coming in 2020, Tesla plans to add a crossover called the Model Y.  Tesla will announce the location for where it\u2019ll build that in three to six months, with capital spending toward the vehicle starting later this year.  The company expects to deliver about 100,000 Model S sedans and Model X sport utility vehicles, in line with last year\u2019s 101,312.  The department tasked with pulling that off will now be reporting directly to the CEO after Lyft Inc. hired away Jon McNeill, who had been president of global sales and service at Tesla and an influential figure at the company.

Elon Musk, in a testy Twitter exchange, said he is \u201cback to sleeping at the factory\u201d while trying to fix production delays with the Model 3 electric car. It\u2019s a move reminiscent of Tesla\u2019s last vehicle launch\u2014the Model X\u2014when Musk famously kept a sleeping bag near the production line so he could immediately address any hiccups.  \u201cCar biz is hell,\u201d Musk said.  The posts on Twitter came as investors await Tesla\u2019s first-quarter production numbers, which are expected to fall short of company forecasts. The exchange, with a reporter at the Information, a tech and business news site, followed a story by the outlet that Musk had taken over Model 3 production from Tesla\u2019s head of engineering, Doug Field.  For the past year, Field has managed engineering of both the vehicle and its production. Musk said Field had originally been tasked with both jobs to ensure Tesla doesn\u2019t design cars that are \u201ccrazy hard to build,\u201d but now that the company was back in the thick of production, \u201cit\u2019s better to divide and conquer.\u201d  Tesla Inc. is under enormous pressure to build the Model 3 fast enough to meet customer demand\u2014and to bring in revenue to offset billions of dollars spent preparing for its rollout. An experimental tracking model developed by Bloomberg estimates that Tesla was able to produce 9,285 Model 3s for the quarter and achieved a final burst of production of as many as 2,200 cars a week. Musk had vowed to reach 2,500 a week by the end of the first quarter\u2014a target that was already scaled back from a prior forecast of 5,000 a week by the end of 2017.  See more about the Bloomberg Model 3 Tracker here.  Tesla has built up a die-hard fan base, with some half a million people putting down $1,000 reservations for the Model 3 since it was unveiled two years ago. But the company is still trying to prove it has what it takes to be a true mass-production company. Tesla reports production and delivery results within a few days of each quarter ending.  When Tesla rolled out the Model X in late 2015, it was years behind schedule, and production was marred by problems with its complicated falcon wing doors, custom mono-post rear seats and other unique new high-tech features. Musk told investors in 2016 that he kept a sleeping bag on hand and moved his desk to wherever the factory problems were most troublesome.  It\u2019s not clear where Tesla\u2019s current bottlenecks reside. During a first-quarter earnings call, Musk said the primary holdup was with robots at the company\u2019s battery Gigafactory near Reno, Nevada. A new production line had been built for it at Tesla\u2019s Grohmann Automation labs in Germany and was scheduled to be installed at the Gigafactory last month. If Musk is instead camping out at the automaker\u2019s Fremont, California, car factory, that would suggest his attention has shifted away from the batteries to car assembly. Tesla wants to double production in the next three months, to 5,000 cars a week. Fremont is where that will, or won\u2019t, happen.  Even if Tesla reaches its first-quarter production target, it\u2019s not clear whether the company will be able to sustain and build off of it. According to Musk\u2019s latest posts on Twitter, the company hasn\u2019t emerged from production hell just yet.

The last one was announced a month ago on Tesla's earnings call by none other than CEO Elon Musk, with not just brevity but a hint of insouciance:  Actually, one thing we forgot to mention is John McNeill, who is heading up our sales and service group, is departing the company. We wish him well in his future career. And going forward, I will be having the sales and service report directly to me. There are no plans to search for a replacement.  Just the guy running the sales effort during possibly the most critical launch of a Tesla vehicle yet. No biggie.  Actually, that is kind of how the bond market seems to be taking it. Those bonds mentioned above are now yielding about 6.3 percent, a full percentage point above their coupon. But the spreads betray a more laid-back attitude:  So? Tesla's bond yield is up but that's down to Treasuries selling off rather than a blowout in spreads Source: Bloomberg  These spreads actually looked low even before the news of Branderiz's departure, considering Tesla's growing reliance on negative working capital to fund its operations (see this) and its net debt doubling last year to $6.8 billion (see this).  There's more to be found off the balance sheet, too. According to Tesla's annual filing, which dropped a couple of weeks ago, it's potentially on the hook for an estimated $8.5 billion of contracted purchases over the next three years alone. Most of this relates to batteries coming from Panasonic Corp. and emphasizes the importance of Model 3 production catching up with the vast ambitions set ahead of it.  Much Obliged Tesla's contractual obligations, related mainly to battery purchases, are bigger than its long-term debt Source: Company filing  That fixed-income investors are fine with this is, of course, a function of their primary defense; namely, Tesla's gravity-defying stock price. The potential for an eighth equity sale to refill company coffers serves to salve any wounds inflicted by slipping Model 3 targets or senior managers sipping away. In early trading on Friday morning, the shares were down less than 1 percent.  Like I Said: So? Tesla's share price shrugs off setbacks with remarkable ease Source: Bloomberg  What might cause the market's confidence to crack? It's impossible to say, though the Model 3's woes represent the most acute threat. We are now just over three weeks away from the March 31 deadline to get weekly production up to 2,500; a target that's been reset several times already. Bloomberg's own tracker estimates the current rate at less than 700.  It's worth pointing out that Adam Jonas, Morgan Stanley's usually bullish analyst on Tesla, on Friday morning issued a new report that offered a curious cocktail combining optimism about the company overcoming its immediate problems with the notion that investors might use that outcome to \"exit\" the stock. The rationale is that even if Tesla gets the Model 3 going, competitive pressure and vast infrastructure needs to realize the company's ambitions will constrain it. As Jonas puts it:  We had harbored greater conviction on the long side, as we felt that investors underestimated the scope of the addressable market and the value of Tesla\u2019s platform (hardware, software, people, physical infrastructure and network effect).

In August, they lined up for the chance to finance Tesla Inc.\u2019s ambitious rollout of its Model 3 sedan. Wooed by Musk\u2019s personal appeals, bond investors pretty much ignored the carmaker\u2019s prolific cash burn and repeated failures to meet production targets and lent it $1.8 billion at record-low interest rates.  But now, after a spate of fresh setbacks in the past week, including a fatal Tesla crash and a credit-rating downgrade, bondholders are asking hard questions about whether Musk can deliver on his bold promise to bring electric cars to the masses before the company runs out of cash. On Wednesday, Tesla\u2019s notes plunged to a low of 86 cents on the dollar, the clearest sign yet creditors aren\u2019t totally sure the company will be money good.

Everyone is worried.\u201d  The consequences are significant. Tesla\u2019s woes have played out most visibly in the stock market, with its shares suffering a two-day, 15 percent drop that\u2019s the biggest since 2016. But surging borrowing costs, which are now near 8 percent, could hamper the carmaker\u2019s ability to finance itself at a critical time.  For Bloomberg\u2019s Tesla Model 3 production tracker, click here.  A representative for Tesla didn\u2019t immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.  The company, which has never shown an annual profit in the 15 years since it was founded, will need to raise over $2 billion to cover not only its cash burn this year, but also about $1.2 billion of debt that comes due by 2019, Moody\u2019s Investors Service analyst Bruce Clark said in a report Tuesday.  Tesla is burning through money so fast that, without additional financing, it would run out of cash before year-end. To put that into perspective, that amounts to more than $6,500 every minute of every day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  \u2018Crunch Time\u2019  That puts the company in \u201ccrunch time\u201d now to improve margins, Cowen & Co. analysts led by Jeffrey Osborne said in a note Tuesday. Tesla will report first-quarter production figures for the Model 3 early next week. While the company has said it expects to end the quarter making 2,500 Model 3s per week, analysts are skeptical.  The Tesla Model 3. Photographer: Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg  \u201cBased on our own checks as well as user reported registration data found online, Tesla\u2019s model 3 ramp is likely still moving slower than management\u2019s previously pushed out targets,\u201d Osborne wrote.  Another production miss wouldn\u2019t make it any easier for Tesla to persuade bond investors to hand over more money. While shareholders just approved a massive $2.6 billion pay package for Musk, three executives have headed for the exits this quarter, including two from the company\u2019s finance team.  \u2018On The Precipice\u2019  \u201cPeople are looking at the abyss here, they\u2019re looking at it spiral out of control,\u201d said Jack Flaherty, a portfolio manager at GAM Holding AG. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely on the precipice.\u201d  To Diamond Hill\u2019s Zox, who didn\u2019t buy Tesla\u2019s bonds last year, yields are still too low to offset the risks of lending to a business in its early growth phase. They would need be between 10 to 12 percent to get him interested.  And with a junk rating of Caa1 from Moody\u2019s on Tesla\u2019s unsecured bonds -- seven levels below investment grade -- coming back to the market might prove to be too onerous in any case, says Bloomberg Intelligence\u2019s Joel Levington.  The company might need to consider selling equity, issuing convertible bonds and structured debt or taking out bank loans, he said.  \u201cI would think it\u2019d be off the table,\u201d said Levington, referring to another unsecured bond sale. \u201cThey have to look at all options.\u201d  \u2014 With assistance by Austin Weinstein, Dana Hull, Sally Bakewell, Taka Endo, and Claire Boston", "stock": "TSLA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-28", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-28/tesla-bonds-down-to-86-cents-start-to-flash-warning-signals"}, {"article": "Here\u2019s what Tesla Inc. shareholders just bought for $2.6 billion: a stronger guarantee that Elon Musk will stick around for at least the next decade.  Investors on Wednesday approved what may be the largest compensation deal in history for its chief executive officer, pegged on ambitions to turn Tesla into one of the world\u2019s largest companies as it ventures beyond solar panels and electric cars. If successful, the award could end up being worth more than $50 billion -- a sum so large it might just ensure that Musk\u2019s array of other passions and esoteric side projects won\u2019t steal too much time from his work at Tesla.  \u201cI expect to remain CEO for the foreseeable future,\u201d Musk said during last month\u2019s earnings call with analysts. But he didn\u2019t rule out handing over the CEO responsibilities if a suitable successor would appear, allowing him to focus on \u201cdesign and engineering, which is what I like doing best.\u201d  Musk is also the CEO of Mars-bound Space Exploration Technologies Corp. and has embarked on several other projects of late, including tunnel digger Boring Co. and a brain-computer interface startup called Neuralink. The new award -- which was approved at Tesla\u2019s special meeting in Fremont, California -- requires Musk remain at the electric-car maker either as CEO or executive chairman and chief product officer.  Tesla said in a filing that about 73 percent of the votes cast in person or by proxy at the meeting were in favor of the award, excluding those owned directly or indirectly by Musk and his brother, Kimbal.  Profit Ahead?  Tesla shares traded higher following news of the vote. The stock closed up 1.9 percent in New York. A spokesman for the company declined to comment.  The pay plan helps ensure Musk will remain at Tesla at least until 2028, but several questions loom. The award contains a number of audacious goals and no detailed plan of how to get there, including when the manufacturer will turn its first-ever annual profit. Additionally, a series of executive exits in the past year has left Tesla without a clear No. 2 -- a potential concern even if Musk stays front and center.  This quarter alone, Tesla has lost Jon McNeill, president of sales and service; its accounting chief Eric Branderiz; and Susan Repo, corporate treasurer and vice president of finance. Going back a full year, Tesla has also lost executives including Chief Financial Officer Jason Wheeler; Chris Lattner, an Apple Inc. hire who left after leading Tesla\u2019s Autopilot engineering team for less than six months; Kurt Kelty, a senior battery executive; and Diarmuid O\u2019Connell, vice president of business development.  Jamie Albertine, analyst at Consumer Edge Research, said he sees Tesla needing to hire a chief operating officer or a new head of service \u201cat some point in the near future.\u201d Musk said on the earnings call last month that McNeill\u2019s department would report directly to him and that \u201cthere are no plans to search for a replacement,\u201d even as some investors fear he\u2019s spreading himself too thin. In 2016, Musk said he was working so hard, he kept a sleeping bag in a conference room adjacent to Tesla\u2019s production line in Fremont.  Billionaire Bait  The award, which won\u2019t vest unless a set of ambitious financial goals are met, had been cheered by some large Tesla investors who said it would help the CEO drive the business forward. Critics, including the two largest proxy advisers, said it was too costly and questioned why Musk, a billionaire who has about half his wealth tied up in company stock, needed more equity to stay motivated.  The board needed majority approval to make the grant, which likely is the largest one-time compensation deal ever awarded. Tesla had said Musk and his brother, who\u2019s a company director, wouldn\u2019t vote their shares.  Tesla Targets Musk's award will pay when Tesla hits pairs of goals, with one tied to market value Source: Proxy filing  Under the new plan, Musk will earn one-12th of the options every time Tesla hits a pair of goals: one tied to its market value and the other linked to either revenue or earnings excluding certain charges. For Musk to get all the options, Tesla would have to become worth $650 billion -- more than Facebook Inc. -- and produce more revenue than Procter & Gamble Co.  Tesla has said in regulatory filings that Musk\u2019s award could yield him more than $50 billion if all goals are achieved. Some investors have said the package aligns with their interests, signaling they don\u2019t mind if Musk gets wealthier, as long as they also see big returns.  Ross Gerber tweet to Elon Musk and Tesla Inc. Source: @GerberKawasaki/Twitter Inc.  Large shareholders including Baillie Gifford & Co. and T. Rowe Price Group Inc. signaled ahead of the vote that they would probably support the package. Spokesmen for Baillie Gifford and Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. were not immediately available to comment. T. Rowe Price and shareholder Fidelity, which holds almost 10 percent of Tesla stock, declined to comment.  Potential Dilution  California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, the second-largest pension fund in the U.S., didn\u2019t support the plan, citing concerns about potential dilution and an absence of profitability goals. Large stock awards can be costly for investors in two ways: They can increase a company\u2019s expenses and they dilute the stakes of existing shareholders.

Tesla's semi-autonomous driver assist system that handles some tasks and allows drivers under certain conditions to take their hands off the wheel.  The system requires drivers to keep their hands on the steering wheel, and emits escalating alerts if they don't.  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said on Tuesday it was sending two investigators to examine the crash of a Tesla vehicle apparently traveling in semi-autonomous mode and a fire truck in California.  In a post on Twitter, the federal safety agency said the \"field investigation\" would examine both driver and vehicle factors in Monday's accident.  This is the second time the safety board has probed a Tesla crash that may be linked to Autopilot, Tesla's semi-autonomous driver assist system that handles some tasks and allows drivers under certain conditions to take their hands off the wheel for extended periods.  The Culver City, California fire department said in a Twitter post that on Monday an engine was struck by a Tesla \"traveling at 65 mph. The driver reports the vehicle was on Autopilot. Amazingly there were no injuries.\"  The NTSB faulted Tesla in a prior fatal Autopilot crash.  In September, the NTSB chairman said \"operational limitations\" in the Tesla Model S played a \"major role\" in a May 2016 crash that killed a driver using the vehicle's semi-autonomous system.  The limits on the system include factors such as Tesla being unable to ensure driver attention even when the car is traveling at high speeds, ensuring Autopilot is used only on certain roads and monitoring driver engagement, NTSB said in September.  The NTSB recommended auto safety regulators and automakers take steps to ensure that semi-autonomous systems are not misused.  \"System safeguards were lacking,\" NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said.  Tesla declined to comment Tuesday on the new probe. In September the company said, \"Autopilot significantly increases safety,\" citing an earlier government study that suggested the system reduced the incidence of crashes.  The company has emphasized that \"Autopilot is not a fully self-driving technology and drivers need to remain attentive at all times.\"  Joshua Brown, a 40-year-old Ohio man, was killed near Williston, Florida, when his Model S collided with a truck while it was engaged in the Autopilot mode.  The fatal incident raised questions about the safety of systems that can perform driving tasks for extended stretches of time with little or no human intervention, but which cannot completely replace human drivers.  The NTSB said Tesla could have taken further steps to prevent the system's misuse, and faulted the driver for not paying attention. The agency said the Autopilot system operated as designed but did not ensure drivers paid adequate attention.

Musk put his Roadster on top of the 230-foot-tall rocket with a spacesuit-clad dummy named \"Starman\" in the driver's seat. Launching the car demonstrated Falcon Heavy's capabilities and was reportedly a backup plan for a scientific NASA or military payload.  The Roadster's short-lived yet unparalleled camera feeds, overall silliness (as Musk has described it), and far-flung path through space captured global attention.  But not all of it has proved welcome.  SpaceX founder Elon Musk in a press conference after the launch of Falcon Heavy. Dave Mosher/Business Insider The Planetary Society's Jason Davis bemoaned the planetary protection risk posed by Musk's un-sterilized car crashing into Mars and sprinkling debris coated with bacteria, viruses, and fungi all over the planet. The reason: alien microbes may be hiding out in Martian soil.  \"NASA goes to great lengths sterilizing spacecraft designed to land on Mars, in order to make sure there's no chance of Earthly microbes contaminating the surface,\" Davis wrote in a post before launch. \"Such a contamination could harm existing life and muddle scientific efforts to search for said life.\"  But that risk now appears minimal, according to a new scientific study titled \"The random walk of cars and their collision probabilities with planets.\"  Three researchers at the University of Toronto posted their paper on Tuesday to the pre-print arXiv server and submitted to the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.  Where and when Musk's Tesla will most likely crash  A chart showing the location of Elon Musk's Tesla Roadster in space on February 15, 2018. WhereIsTesla.com  Hanno Rein, an astrophysicist and lead author of the study, said the roughly week-long research came out of advanced orbital-mechanics computer simulations.  \"Earth is the most likely place the car will crash, followed by Venus, and then the sun,\" Rein told Business Insider, and likely within 10 million years \u2014 not hundreds of millions or possibly billions, as Musk has suggested.  To arrive at that conclusion, Rein and his colleagues started with orbital tracking data for the Roadster posted by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Then they plugged that data into simulation software called REBOUND, which allowed them to fast-forward the car's likeliest orbital paths through the solar system over the next few million years.  That data suggest Musk's car will fly out past Mars orbit, spending very little time there, and then swing back around, over and over again.  \"Every 30 years or so, it will come relatively close to the Earth,\" Rein said, where it will get a gravitational tug. \"This causes a change of a few percent in some of the orbital parameters. The distance to the sun would change slightly, for example, and the orbit's eccentricity.\"  The calculations suggest the Roadster will come within one Earth-moon distance of our planet within 100 years, possibly enabling new Earth-based telescope views.  Elon Musk's red Tesla Roadster before launching on a Falcon Heavy rocket toward Mars orbit. Elon Musk/SpaceX; Instagram  But after its third flyby, Rein said the Roadster will take on an increasingly chaotic and somewhat unpredictable path through space. That's because those gravitational tugs near Earth's orbit \u2014 where the car will spend most of its time compared to other bodies in the system \u2014 can \"lead to a huge change afterward,\" Rein said.  By running hundreds of different simulations of those orbital possibilities out to 3.5 million years from today, Rein and his colleagues figured out there's a 6% chance of the Roadster crashing into Earth and a 2.5% chance of crashing into Venus during that time.  \"We've not seen any single collision with Mars in 240 simulations, though we continue to run them and see what happens,\" Rein said. \"The likely outcome is that it will crash, in tens of millions of years, into Earth or Venus or the sun.\"  Astronomers are tracking the car in space  Two other astronomers \u2014 Gianluca Masi of The Virtual Telescope Project and Michael Schwartz of Tenagra Observatories, Ltd. \u2014 also used JPL data to track the Roadster.  Last week, they managed to photograph the car flying beyond the moon moving at a speed of roughly 25,000 miles per hour.  The vehicle is reflective enough to see through a telescope, at least for now, leading to what they called a \"stunning\" animation of several images.  Masi said he and Schwartz will continue to track the Roadster for as long as possible.  \"The object is slowly fading: you can image it now with a 6\" or so scope,\" Masi told Business Insider in an email. \"In one month or so it will need a much larger scope to be imaged (16\" or larger).\"", "stock": "TSLA", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-15", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://uk.businessinsider.com/starman-elon-musk-car-orbit-collision-risk-calculations-2018-2"}, {"article": "Tesla Model 3.

Justin Sullivan/Getty Images  The idea that Apple should buy Tesla has been floated many times.  Apple now has more than enough cash coming back to the US to do the deal.  Tesla needs to be saved from its delusional idea about the company's future growth \u2014 and Apple needs to be saved from the disaster of its car project.  Last November, Rolling Stone published a profile of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, written by Neil Strauss, a neo-gonzo journalist who made his name with a book about pickup culture. And in that interview Musk made a confession.  \"I wish we could be private with Tesla,\" Musk told Strauss. \"It actually makes us less efficient to be a public company.\"  Tesla has been public since its 2010 IPO and since then the stock has risen from about $20 a share to nearly $400 at one point in 2017. The company's market cap is now close to $60 billion. Investors who jumped in seven years ago have enjoyed a return of nearly 1,200%.  Musk might be the only person who wishes Tesla were private. Even short-sellers, recently clobbered by Tesla's surge, have been delighted when the stock has gone through one of its periodic swoons of $100 in a few months. And ironically, Musk's next ten years of compensation are now completely tied to Tesla's market performance, which the board of directors thinks can yield a $650-billion market cap.  That's delusional. In many ways, it sets Musk up for both continued inefficiency \u2014 a lot of second-guessing about investments in automation, for example, at the expense of hitting production targets \u2014 and potentially epic failure. It also represents a radical formulation of shareholder value theory.  Tesla is wildly overvalued, and what it needs now isn't a fatter stock price but rather an ability to satisfy customers. For the Model 3 mass-market vehicle, currently stalled amid production bottlenecks, Tesla has 400,000 mostly unfulfilled pre-orders.  Apple buying Tesla is an idea that always seems to be on the table  Apple CEO Tim Cook. Getty  In the past, there's been talk about somebody buying Tesla. Usually, Apple is the one that gets everybody's heart racing. I've shot down this idea several times. But with the announcement of Musk's new pay package, I think Tesla needs to be rescued from itself. And that Musk should get his wish.  Tesla is worth so much that there aren't very many companies able to buy the automaker. And Tesla going truly private would be too much of a reversal of history as well as a financial improbability, although if the bottom falls out some investors might someday snap up what's left of Tesla on the cheap.  Apple, thanks to the new tax bill, will repatriate over $250 billion is cash that it has been keeping overseas. Even after paying taxes on it, at the reduced corporate rate, it will have arguably too much left over. It could easily wind up going into share buybacks or a dividend, or Apple could continue its pattern of making small acquisitions.  Or the company, which is sitting on a mature iPhone business that mints the profits but could be looking at more severe growth headwinds in coming years, could swing for the fences and get a piece of the multi-trillion global transportation industry. If Tim Cook agrees with the Tesla board that the company will be worth $650 billion in a decade, then buying Tesla now would be a staggering bargain.  The obvious question is, \"Who would be Tesla's CEO?\" Musk's pay package is designed to ensure that it's him, an extreme evolution of addressing the \"great man\" risk that companies led by visionary founders face. But Musk is also running SpaceX and he's on the verge of launching a huge rocket that could pave the way for a Mars mission. Dealing with Tesla's difficulties could be seen as a needless distraction.  That said, Musk could remain CEO of Tesla as an independent business unit of Apple, while Tim Cook would run the entire show (Musk could also relinquish the CEO title but continue as chairman of the board). In a way, Cook isn't really a CEO in the Musk/Steve Jobs vein anyway. He's more like a mega-COO.  And that's just what Tesla actually needs right now. If it was Jobs who rescued Apple and put it on the path that led to the iPod and the iPhone, it was Cook who turned the company into the profit-making colossus it has become. The guy is a supply-chain genius. Making stuff is his bag. And at the moment, Tesla is struggling mightily to make stuff, falling well behind its ambitious production targets for the Model 3 mass-market vehicle.  Tesla would also witness its cash-burn challenges \u2014 over $1 billion per quarter \u2014 vanish. Apple could fund losses for years.  Tesla could help Apple get into the car business The Apple Car project isn't going well. Apple  Apple has a history of falling into innovations troughs. It's in one now, following the monumental success of the iPhone. The Apple Watch hasn't been a gamechanger, and the company is chasing Amazon on smart speakers. Apple clearly wants to do something in the transportation space, but thus far its efforts have been at best confused and at worst pathetic.  Buying Tesla would change that overnight. The Apple Car, really, is a Tesla car anyway. The whole philosophy behind Tesla's vehicles, and especially the ultra-minimalist Model 3, is Apple-esque. The wait for the Apple Car would be immediately over.  And that would enable Apple to focus on bringing to Tesla what Apple's engineers and designers are now probably working on: an entirely new vehicle interface \u2014 an operating system for the car of the future.  Tesla has aspects of such a system in place, from over-the-air software updates to an increasing focus on single screens for all vehicle operations. Apple would enhance and unify these components and transform them into something unexpected. This is Apple's mojo: take something that works and make it much, much better.  Missing out on a mega-return \u2014 but one that isn't likely  Tesla market cap has become epic. Andy Kiersz/Business Insider  For investors, of course, Apple buying Tesla would eliminate any chance of a mega-return. But I think the odds are low that the 1,000%-plus payback of the past seven years will be matched by another 1,000% surge over the next ten years (Tesla is, after all, 14 years old \u2014 hardly a startup). If Tesla stays public, stockholders will also have to put up with numerous, diluting capital raises and the ever-present threat that Tesla's lack of cash and debt burden will lead to a bankruptcy.  If Apple bought Tesla, the carmaker's growth would be piped into Apple shares, and Tesla investors would certainly get a premium for their holdings, as Apple can afford to overpay. I don't even think that government regulators would have issues with the merger. Sure, Apple would be buying the dominant electric-car manufacturer. But as of 2018, the EV market makes up only 1% of global sales.  I would have stuck to my guns on the foolishness of an Apple acquisition of Tesla were it not for the reckless pay package that Tesla concocted for Musk. But I now think that Tesla is fueling a dangerous idea about the company's capabilities. Somebody needs to save Tesla from its hubris.

An analyst predicted that Tesla could build 100,000 new Model S cars in 2018, versus 400,000 preorders.  LONDON \u2014 Tesla on Tuesday announced a new compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk, and he will not get paid a single dollar unless his company's shareholders do extremely well.  Perhaps unfortunately for the 400,000 or so people who have preordered a Tesla electric vehicle, Musk's compensation won't be tied to his company's ability to build cars.  Tesla has a history of struggling with production and has missed key targets. For example, after Musk said Tesla aimed to produce 20,000 Model 3 vehicles a month by this past December, the company delivered only 1,550 in the entire fourth quarter. Musk has also said he wants to build 500,000 vehicles this year, but that now seems unlikely given the now delayed production of the Model 3.  An analyst note from December projected just 100,000 Model S Teslas coming off the line in 2018.  Tesla's stock has continued to outpace its competitors', soaring by over 1,000% since the carmaker went public in 2010.

The board unveiled a pay deal for Elon Musk, the chief executive, on Tuesday that will make him nearly $60 billion if he hits new targets by 2028. That\u2019s on top of the $100 billion gain the electric-car pioneer would make on his existing stake.  Mr. Musk\u2019s new targets are even more ambitious than the 10-year goals from 2012 that he blew through years early. The potential value of share grants totaling 12 percent of the company is vast, but at least the Tesla board has done much more than the usual lip service in setting a serious challenge.  It involves Mr. Musk hitting two sets of metrics. First, Tesla\u2019s market capitalization has to reach $650 billion \u2014 more than 10 times its current level and a valuation that would be fourth among today\u2019s publicly listed companies behind Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft, and just ahead of Amazon.  Second, he must turbocharge Tesla\u2019s financial performance. That requires either growing annual revenue to $175 billion, almost 15 times 2017\u2019s expected top line, or making $14 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a figure that may come in at just over $500 million for last year. There are 12 steps along the route to the maximum payout.  Reaching the revenue target could mean selling well over 2 million of Tesla\u2019s current and planned vehicles, Breakingviews calculates. That level of sales would be in the same ballpark as BMW \u2014 and last year\u2019s total for Tesla was barely over 100,000 vehicles. That doesn\u2019t allow for any surge in the company\u2019s solar-panel and electric-storage business, which at present contributes a single-digit percentage to the top line. Still, to get close would require Tesla to dominate the market for electric cars even as General Motors, Nissan and others ramp up their efforts.  One model for Musk could be Amazon, whose $177 billion of expected 2017 revenue would mark a 12-fold increase from 2007. Founder Jeff Bezos\u2019s stock has surged to 18 times its value a decade ago.

But Mr. Musk\u2019s compensation plan is no illusion: He gets paid only if the company succeeds over the long term with significant gains in market cap. And it\u2019s impossible for him to manipulate the system by trying to prop up the stock price for a temporary period. Under the terms of the arrangement, even once his shares vest, he has to hold them an additional five years before he is allowed to sell them.  The way the arrangement is structured, each milestone is a blunt instrument: He either reaches it or gets nothing.  \u201cIf all that happens over the next 10 years is that Tesla\u2019s value grows by 80 or 90 percent, then my amount of compensation would be zero,\u201d he said. (His calculations were based on the stock price at the beginning of this year when the company was worth about $50 billion.)  Still, he contended, \u201cI actually see the potential for Tesla to become a trillion-dollar company within a 10-year period.\u201d  Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Many other companies have installed outsize packages that often come at the expense of shareholders because the executives get paid even when they underperform their peers.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Asked how he thinks shareholders should feel about Mr. Musk\u2019s new pay package, Ira Ehrenpreis, chairman of Tesla\u2019s compensation committee, told me, \u201cIt\u2019s heads you win, tails you don\u2019t lose,\u201d meaning if Mr. Musk is gaining billions then shareholders are winning, too. And if Mr. Musk does not perform, shareholders pay nothing.  Mr. Musk\u2019s new compensation plan is similar to the previous one put in place when the company was worth $3.2 billion in 2012. Only now, the numbers are much larger. That package also paid Mr. Musk only when he reached certain market value and operational benchmarks. And virtually nobody could imagine Tesla would be worth 17 times what it was back then.  Mr. Musk has reached all but one of the metrics in that plan.  Even though Mr. Musk\u2019s shares have vested, he has not sold them except to pay the taxes on the grants. His current stake is worth $13 billion.  Mr. Musk does not take a salary, although under California State law, Tesla is required to pay him at least minimum wage. Tesla sends him checks that pay him a little more than $37,000 annually. \u201cI don\u2019t cash it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just ends up accumulating in a Tesla bank account somewhere.\u201d  To afford to live, Mr. Musk has borrowed against his shares, a practice that some corporate executives have questioned. Mr. Musk insists that the loans are such a small portion of his stake in the company that even if Tesla shares were to fall precipitously, it would not impact him or the company.  If Mr. Musk succeeds in hitting some of his benchmarks, it would also mean that the company\u2019s employees, including those who work on the factory floor, who get paid in both cash and stock, could become wealthy.  Under the terms of the deal, which is subject to shareholder approval, Mr. Musk has to remain the company\u2019s chief executive, though the agreement would allow him to become chief product officer and executive chairman with a chief executive reporting to him. He said he saw that as a possibility only if the company became so large that he needed to recruit a top person to oversee the operations.  Mr. Musk has often said he is not driven by money. So what is it about this incentive plan that appeals to him?  \u201cNone of it is intended for dynastic wealth creation,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reason that it\u2019s important to me personally is that there\u2019s some pretty big things that I want to do.\u201d  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  \u201cI want to contribute as much as possible to humanity becoming a multi-planet species,\u201d he said, alluding to a goal he has talked about often, including having people live on Mars. \u201cThat obviously requires a certain amount of capital.\u201d", "stock": "TSLA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-01-23", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/23/business/dealbook/tesla-elon-musk-pay.html"}, {"article": "Still, Amazon cannot quietly hope that such criticism just fades away. Amazon\u2019s rapid growth, immense bargaining power, eye-catching initiatives and estimated 44 percent share of U.S. e-commerce sales make the company vulnerable to accusations that it is too powerful.  But if the Trump administration pursues ways to curtail the company, it would meet sizable obstacles.  Amazon accounts for only 4 percent of all retail sales in the United States, a recent survey estimated. Its revenue is a third of Walmart\u2019s and, even after its acquisition of Whole Foods, Amazon\u2019s footing in the grocery business is still small.  All in all, it would be hard to show that Amazon is pushing prices higher for consumers.  Amazon also has a loyal customer base \u2014 it has an estimated 90 million Prime members \u2014 and the public views it relatively favorably. When the Department of Justice\u2019s antitrust lawyers went after the proposed merger of Time Warner and AT&T, it was not targeting companies that were particularly popular with the public.  Still, some Amazon critics see a possible, though small, opening. In theory, an antitrust case could focus on the firms that supply Amazon with goods, according to Christopher L. Sagers, a law professor at Cleveland State University. If a company consistently uses its power to demand a good from suppliers at too low a price, the public could still get hurt. That\u2019s because the supply of the good could decline, its quality degrade, and there may be less innovation in the sector that produces the good, Mr. Sagers said.  But anyone bringing that against Amazon would have to explain why Walmart would not be a target, too.  \u2014 Peter Eavis  Photo  Public pension fund wants changes to Facebook\u2019s board.  The investment adviser to New York City\u2019s pension funds is calling for changes to Facebook\u2019s board to address the fallout from Cambridge Analytica\u2019s improper harvesting of information from 50 million users of the social network.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  New York City\u2019s comptroller, Scott M. Stringer, wrote in a letter addressed to Dr. Susan Desmond-Hellmann, an independent director at Facebook and the chief executive of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation:  \u201cFacebook is now among the most valuable and, given the immense power and reach of its platform, most influential companies in the world. The very data collection and sharing practices that made its extraordinary growth possible, and that are the basis of the company\u2019s business model, are now facing potential regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world.\u201d  New York City\u2019s pension funds, which have more than $193 billion in assets under management, own $895 million of Facebook\u2019s shares, according to the letter. Even with the recent tumble in its shares, Facebook is valued at more than $450 billion.  In his letter, Mr. Stringer calls on Facebook\u2019s independent directors to take four steps to help restore investor confidence.  Here are the proposed changes:  1) Add at least three new independent directors to improve the board\u2019s ability to oversee the evolving risks Facebook faces.  2) Name an independent director as chairman, allowing Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive and chairman, to focus on running the company.  3) Create a committee of independent directors to oversee the company\u2019s data privacy policies and risks.  4) Institute a clawback policy so that the board can \u201crecoup executive pay in the event of violations of law, regulation or company policy.\u201d  Photo  Trump tweets Amazon does not pay enough taxes.  President Trump spoke out against Amazon on Thursday, saying that the online behemoth does not pay enough taxes and uses the United States postal system \u201cas their Delivery Boy.\u201d  The president\u2019s commentary, made in a Twitter post, comes amid reports that Mr. Trump has expressed an interest in reining in the e-commerce business.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Amazon and the company\u2019s founder, Jeff Bezos, are among Mr. Trump\u2019s regular Twitter targets. In December, Mr. Trump questioned whether the United States Post Office charges Amazon enough for package deliveries. And in August, Mr. Trump said Amazon hurts taxpaying businesses.  Amazon, however, does pay taxes \u2014 $412 million in 2016, for instance, according to the company\u2019s report to the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Axios reported on Wednesday that Mr. Trump has wondered aloud whether Amazon could be vulnerable to antitrust or competition laws.  \u201cTrump\u2019s wealthy friends tell him Amazon is destroying their businesses. His real estate buddies tell him \u2014 and he agrees \u2014 that Amazon is killing shopping malls and brick-and-mortar retailers.\u201d  Amazon shares fell more than 7 percent following that Axios article but recovered some of those losses after a White House official told Reuters that the company faced no particular policy changes. But the administration is always looking at its options, the official added. The stock closed down 4.4 percent Wednesday.  Shares were down nearly 2 percent in early trading.  Should shareholders worry? The GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives told Bloomberg that this regulatory threat was unlikely to change Amazon\u2019s business model, but it was still \u201cthe last thing nervous tech investors wanted to see today.\u201d  Retailers, at least, already have some reason to be cheerful.  And Amazon has another target market for expansion: housekeeping.  First quarter profits are going to be big.  Corporate American will start reporting first-quarter results in less than two weeks, and earnings are expected to be big.  Analysts estimate that profits at companies in the S.&P. 500 grew 17.3 percent this quarter, according to FactSet. If the forecasts prove accurate that would be highest earnings growth rate since the first quarter of 2011.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Perhaps most surprising, is that analysts have grown more optimistic on corporate earnings as the quarter progressed. The earnings forecast for the index rose 5.4 percent from the start of the quarter to the end. Typically, analysts lower their expectations as the quarter progresses. On average, the profit estimates for the index fall 3.7 percent from the start of the quarter to the end.  But there are reasons for investors to temper their enthusiasm. Analysts have not been as optimistic about the abilities of companies to increase sales. Revenue is expected to have grown 7.3 percent in the first quarter, up from a 7 percent rate at the start of the quarter.  That suggests analysts are not raising estimates because of increased sales. So why are they? Taxes. And the impact tax reform will have on bottom lines should moderate in the coming quarters.  That may already be happening. BofA Merrill Lynch\u2019s earnings revision ratio for the S.&P. 500 fell in March for the first time in three months. Of course, the pullback comes after the ratio hits the highest level on record in February, but it does suggest that earnings lift from tax reform has begun to wane.  Photo  Are we witnessing the end of a tech boom?  Investors, always willing to believe in technology companies, spent the last three years piling into their shares with abandon. Now the intellectual underpinnings of that rally are being tested.  Exhibit A: Facebook, down 20 percent from its recent high.  Exhibit B: Nvidia, off 12 percent from its recent high.  Exhibit C: Tesla, not a tech stock but in the FANG+ index.  Concerns about Tesla\u2019s ability to fund itself can also be seen in the trading of its debt.  The WSJ\u2019s Charley Grant explains:  Tesla can\u2019t simply cut spending to solve its cash challenge if it hopes to ramp up production. The company has racked up about $10 billion in long-term debt and has $23 billion in total liabilities. To survive long term, Tesla needs to stop overpromising and to scale back its ambitions to goals it actually can achieve. Right now, though, it just needs more money.  Peter Eavis notes that the latest problems for tech giants have raised deeper doubts:  After the Uber incident in Arizona, those companies may take a more realistic look at what they have to spend to create a technology that is efficient and safe, and conclude that they have to pull out of the race or pare back. Users of social media and regulators may prevent social media companies from sharing so much of their data with advertisers, and that could restrain revenue growth. And if the passion for two or three big tech companies wanes, the cooling may spread.  Photo  Barclays pays $2 billion to settle mortgage securities suit.

And all this has to happen at a competitive cost. There\u2019s a lot that can trip you up.\u201d  Even as he introduced the Model 3 at an event last summer, Mr. Musk warned that the company would find itself in \u201cproduction hell\u201d \u2014 and as those words proved prescient, he has had to repeatedly dial back his forecasts for how many Tesla could churn out.  Mr. Musk once envisioned producing as many as 500,000 cars this year, and last summer he was hoping to be able to make 20,000 Model 3s a month by December. More recently, Tesla had aimed to produce at least 2,500 Model 3s per week by the end of the first quarter.  But that is more than it managed in the entire fourth quarter, and it has produced fewer than 10,000 in the first quarter, the company said Tuesday.  There have been signs of momentum, however. In the past seven days, Tesla said, it had produced 2,020 Model 3s, a rate it said it expected to sustain in the coming week.  In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Tesla said it expected its output to \u201cclimb rapidly\u201d through the second quarter and reach 5,000 per week in about three months. It added that it was \u201crapidly addressing production and supply-chain bottlenecks, including several short factory shutdowns to upgrade equipment.\u201d  Tesla has closely guarded the details of its manufacturing system, but Mr. Musk has described it as highly automated.

With a starting price of $35,000, the Model 3 is more affordable than Tesla\u2019s other models and a crucial part of its ambitions to become a mass-market automaker \u2014 as well as to stabilize its finances and turn a profit.  But Mr. Wakefield noted that working out bottlenecks and hitches in auto production often isn\u2019t as straightforward as it could appear. For example, modifying one part to make it fit better or stronger can require other parts to be modified, or can alter the car\u2019s driving characteristics.  \u201cIf you make a change to solve one problem, you can create five other problems,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople think you just find a problem and solve it, but it\u2019s not like that. There are literally millions of problems that come up and require thousands of engineers, working in teams, either at the car company or the suppliers, to deal with.\u201d  While Tesla scrambled to work out the kinks in making the Model 3 in the first quarter, deliveries of the Model S and Model X declined by 23 percent from the previous quarter \u2014 to 21,800 \u2014 even as the company reported \u201cthe most productive quarter in Tesla history.\u201d  Tesla said it had been hurt by a shortage of battery packs for its cars, made at the plant it calls the Gigafactory, near Reno, Nev.  Michelle Krebs, a senior analyst at Autotrader.com, said the decline in deliveries of the Model S and Model X might suggest that the allure of Tesla vehicles has somewhat faded. Electric cars make up fewer than 1 percent of all vehicles sold in the United States.  \u201cYou just wonder if there\u2019s enough growth in electric vehicles,\u201d she said. \u201cAt first everybody who wanted a Tesla and could afford a Tesla hopped on.

But a sustained slump in sales of those vehicles could complicate Tesla\u2019s efforts to trim the losses it has been reporting every three months \u2014 including a net loss of $771 million in the fourth quarter.  Even aside from its production struggles with the Model 3, the company has been hit by a barrage of negative news in recent weeks.  Concern has grown over the safety of Autopilot, its driver-assistance system, after a fatal crash on March 23 that occurred while the system was engaged. It was at least the third fatal crash that has taken place while a driver was using Autopilot.  On Friday, Tesla said the driver had not heeded several visual and audible warnings to put his hands on the steering wheel before his Model X hit a concrete barrier. Neither the driver nor the car appeared to activate the brakes before impact.  Also last week, Moody\u2019s Investors Service downgraded Tesla\u2019s credit rating and said the company risked running short of cash by the end of the year.  The company said Tuesday that it saw no need to take special measures this year to raise cash.

To them, the founder and chief executive, Elon Musk, is beginning to look more like Tesla\u2019s corporate eponym, Nikola Tesla, the brilliant but eccentric scientist who in 1888 created the alternating current electrical grid that powers the world today and who died penniless.  Yet you want to believe that Mr. Musk can pull this off. He rescued Tesla once before, when the company was days away from running out of cash. And in SpaceX, Mr. Musk has proved that he can run a highly sophisticated private spacecraft company.  Tesla\u2019s problem, unfortunately, isn\u2019t rocket science. In some ways it\u2019s more complex.  Tesla can\u2019t seem to run an auto production line, something that the Detroit auto companies that Mr. Musk mocks are very good at. Ford\u2019s electric vehicles and hybrids, such as the Fusion Energi, may not match the Tesla Model X in style or speed, but Ford can knock out millions of fenders and hoods in its stamping operations with absolute certainty and to tight specifications.  Tesla is operating out of the former G.M./Toyota joint venture plant in Fremont, Calif., which produced more than 400,000 cars annually at its peak. Tesla has been running at a quarter of that rate, and has had to resort to pulling cars off the line and finishing them by hand.

In recent days, though, Mr. Trump has targeted Amazon in tweets, asserting that the company has an unfair advantage. It\u2019s not clear what he could do to hurt Amazon\u2019s business, but the company\u2019s stock has plunged. Amazon\u2019s shares may well bounce back, but the criticism has added to investors\u2019 concerns about the outlook for large technology companies, whose soaring stock prices spearheaded the rally that took to the S.&P. 500 to its all-time high in January.  Too much blame can be placed on the White House, however.  Before investors began fretting about tech and trade, the underpinnings of the stock market\u2019s ascent were perhaps not as robust as they looked. Wall Street analysts expect earnings for the companies in the S.&P. 500 to increase 25 percent this year, according to data compiled by Standard & Poor\u2019s, an unusually large jump that was reflected in the stock market valuations. Much of that projected earnings increase is coming from tax cuts and some from expectations that companies\u2019 revenue would grow at a nice clip as global growth stayed strong.  The tax cuts are certainly going to improve profits. But rising interest rates around the world could weigh somewhat on companies\u2019 revenue growth. And if wages and other costs come in higher than expected \u2014 a significant possibility when the economy is suffering a shortage of some workers \u2014 profit margins could get squeezed. \u201cI don\u2019t think either of those are in the numbers,\u201d said Jim Paulsen, chief market strategist at the Leuthold Group.  \u2014 Peter Eavis  Photo  Not Funny  A little humor has not cleared the clouds over Tesla.  Shares in the company were once again sliding on Monday after the company\u2019s C.E.O., Elon Musk, joked on April 1 that Tesla had gone bankrupt, an apparent attempt to make light of concerns that the electric car maker is straining under its debt load.  Tesla\u2019s stock is now down 35 percent from its high of last year. A major reason for the slide is the company\u2019s struggles to meet production targets for its lower-priced Model 3 car. Delays, of course, raise questions about Tesla\u2019s ability to become an efficient mass producer of autos. The company needs to sell a significantly higher number of cars to generate the cash to finance its business and meet debt payments. Tesla is expected early this week to release its first-quarter production and delivery numbers.  Electrek, a publication that covers electric vehicles, reported late Monday morning that Mr. Musk had sent out an email to employees saying that the company was producing more than 2,000 Model 3s a week. Tesla\u2019s stock bounced after the report.  Tesla\u2019s technology is also facing intense scrutiny after one of its Model X cars crashed on March 23, killing the driver. Tesla said late Friday that its assisted driving system, called Autopilot, was engaged in the car before its collision with a concrete divider. As our colleague Neal E. Boudette wrote:  The accident renews questions about Autopilot, a signature feature of Tesla vehicles, and whether the company has gone far enough to ensure that it keeps drivers and passengers safe.  Tesla\u2019s website says one of Autopilot\u2019s safety features is \u201cAutomatic Emergency Braking.\u201d But a Tesla owner\u2019s manual warns riders that this feature \u201cis not designed to avoid a collision.\u201d Wired recently reported that systems like Autopilot are not necessarily designed to detect static obstacles. In the words of one expert:  Raj Rajkumar, who researches autonomous driving at Carnegie Mellon University, thinks those assumptions concern one of Tesla\u2019s key sensors. \u201cThe radars they use are apparently meant for detecting moving objects (as typically used in adaptive cruise control systems), and seem to be not very good in detecting stationary objects,\u201d he says.  Doubts about the fundamental capabilities of Tesla\u2019s Autopilot could crimp demand for its cars among a customer base that is often seeking the best technology.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Questions are also swirling around the timing of Tesla\u2019s announcement about the crash. In its first communication about the accident, the company said:  Out of respect for the privacy of our customer and his family, we do not plan to share any additional details until we conclude the investigation.  The investigation is not over. Yet Tesla went ahead and provided its update on Friday. The motive for doing so is not clear. The United States National Transportation Safety Board on Sunday said it was \u201cunhappy\u201d that Tesla had released information about the crash.  - Peter Eavis  Investors are running from FAANG stocks again.  Tech companies are again dragging down stocks on Wall Street.  The S.&P. 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite are off 3.1 percent and 3.5 percent Monday. The continued fall in the share prices of some of the biggest tech companies is weighing heavily on the indexes.  Amazon is down 5.4 percent, Netflix is off 5.9 percent, Facebook fell 3 percent, Google-parent Alphabet slipped 3.6 percent and Apple dropped 5.9 percent.  After leading the market higher for much of the past two years, tech stocks have hit some turbulence. Since March 16, Facebook, Alphabet, Netflix and Amazon are all down more than 12 percent, while Apple is down 7.3 percent.  Over that period the business models of those companies have come under increased scrutiny. News that Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm hired by President Trump\u2019s 2016 election campaign, gained access to private information on more than 50 million Facebook users has weighed not only on the shares of Facebook but on Alphabet as well. Amazon, meanwhile, has come under attack from President Trump.  In all, those companies have lost more than $300 billion in market value the past two weeks.  Photo  Trump continues to go after Amazon.  President Trump attacked the e-commerce again on Monday morning.  Monday\u2019s tweet is the latest over the past five days from Mr. Trump criticizing Amazon. Over that period, Mr. Trump has accused Amazon of not paying enough taxes, of putting thousands of local retailers out of business and of using the United States Postal Service as its \u201cDelivery Boy.\u201d  Mr. Trump\u2019s willingness to again single out Amazon and characterize it as a tax cheat and a job killer is a remarkable use of the presidential bully pulpit that could have serious implications for the company even without any formal moves by the federal government.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Amazon\u2019s shares are down 4 percent and are off nearly 11 percent since Axios reported on Wednesday about Mr. Trump\u2019s anger toward the company.  Context  \u2022 Amazon has said that the Postal Regulatory Commission, which oversees the service, has consistently found that its contracts with Amazon are profitable.  \u2022 The internet giant collects sales taxes on its own products in all 45 states that have one, but third-party vendors who sell products on the site often do not collect sales tax, a fact that rivals say is unfair. In addition, some municipalities complain that the company does not collect local taxes.  Critic\u2019s corner  DA Davidson analyst Tom Forte wrote in a note via Reuters:  \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s comments are consistent with industry sources we have spoken to in the shipping industry, who often label Amazon\u2019s deal with the USPS as a sweetheart deal. An argument, however, could be made that the USPS was losing billions before it expanded its service offerings for Amazon and would, still, likely lose billions if Amazon discontinued its use of the USPS tomorrow.\u201d  Intel isn\u2019t helping, either.  Shares of the chip maker are down 9 percent, their steepest decline in more than two years, after Bloomberg reported that Apple is planning to use its own chips in Mac computers beginning as early as 2020.  Citing anonymous sources, Bloomberg\u2019s Ian King and Matt Gurman report:  \u201cThe initiative, code named Kalamata, is still in the early developmental stages, but comes as part of a larger strategy to make all of Apple\u2019s devices \u2014 including Macs, iPhones, and iPads \u2014 work more similarly and seamlessly together.\u201d  Apple provides Intel with about 5 percent of its annual revenue.  Who says there are no rivalries in the hedge fund world?  Kenneth C. Griffin\u2019s Citadel has just hired Phil Villhauer, a former top trader at Steven A. Cohen\u2019s investment firm. Mr. Villhauer will become deputy head of global equities at Citadel, a newly created position. He will officially join the Chicago-based hedge fund in the middle of April and work out of Citadel\u2019s office in New York, a Citadel spokesman confirmed.  \u201cWe see this as a big hire for us,\u201d said Zia Ahmed, a Citadel spokesman.  Mr. Villhauer left Mr. Cohen\u2019s family office, Point72 Asset Management, in October after working for the billionaire investor for roughly 15 years. Mr. Villhauer had started at Mr. Cohen\u2019s former firm, SAC Capital Advisors, and most recently served as head of global trading at Point72.  The timing of Mr. Villhauer\u2019s departure came just months before Mr. Cohen was to begin managing money for outside investors.  In January, Mr. Cohen reconfigured Point72 as a hedge fund after establishing it as a family office in 2014 to manage $11 billion of his personal wealth. Point72 has said it has raised between $2 billion and $4 billion in outside money.

He was there when SAC turned into a powerhouse hedge fund, and he was there when the fund pleaded guilty to insider trading charges in 2013. The guilty plea required the firm to stop managing money for outside investors.  When Mr. Villhauer left Point72, Mr. Cohen, in a letter to employees, called the departure a \u201cretirement\u201d and said he was sad to see Mr. Villhauer go.  Now Mr. Villhauer will start a new chapter in his career at another well-known hedge fund firm.  ____________________________  Photo  Why Facebook\u2019s rivals have stayed mum  As Facebook lurches from crisis to crisis, other tech leaders like Marc Benioff and Tim Cook have criticized the company. But, for the most part, it\u2019s in their culture to stick together, Nick Wingfield writes.  Part of the silence, people in the industry say, comes from a desire to avoid the business equivalent of bad karma \u2014 knowing that they, too, may one day face the buzz saw of public censure.  Customers have less trouble speaking out, but those looking to punish major tech companies are finding that but boycotts are easier said than done.

They regained some ground, but took another beating during the financial crisis. G.E. stock was climbing again in recent years, but last year began falling again.  \u201cWhether founders or executives, these individuals have a different risk appetite than other W-2 earning individuals,\u201d said Jeff Schnitz, head of wealth advisory for Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s private bank. \u201cThey have the opportunity to accept risk, and to create upside opportunities for themselves.\u201d  Some chief executives are taking this to new extremes. Elon Musk recently proposed a new compensation plan at Tesla. If approved, he will receive billions of dollars in compensation if he manages to double, triple and quadruple the value of the company. He will receive nothing if he does not.  Rick Smith, the chief executive of Axon, followed Mr. Musk\u2019s lead and proposed a nearly identical plan, albeit with smaller targets for the market valuation.  Mr. Musk and Mr. Smith are outliers. But even for less ambitions executives, the same principle holds.  \u201cYou want the C.E.O. fully aligned and driving a strong return on the investment,\u201d said Shirl Penney, the founder of Dynasty Financial Partners. \u201cThe investors want the senior leadership team as all in as possible.\u201d  Not everyone is willing to put all their eggs in one basket, however. And for those making a mere few hundred thousand dollars, or even a few million a year, the need to diversify can be real.  Photo  \u201cFor someone who is more of a middle-line manager who is saving toward retirement, we would typically advise not having more than 10 percent of your net worth in any one security,\u201d said Mr. Penney. \u201cYou try to advise someone to liquidate as much of their stock as possible and put it into a more diversified portfolio.\u201d  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  That can be easy for an executive at a publicly traded company. But it can be virtually impossible for executives or founders at private start-ups, many of whom have preferred stock or founders shares that are illiquid until a sale or initial public offering.  \u201cSelling or diversifying out of that stock has not only a financial ramification for it, but could have ramifications around who much control they have,\u201d said Mr. Penney.  And when start-up executives and founders do sell, the results can vary widely. Peter Thiel, an early investor in Facebook, has sold most all of his shares in the company, even as he remains a board member. It\u2019s a prudent bet \u2014 Facebook shares are hovering near their all-time high.  Photo  But sometimes, selling too early can be disastrous. Ronald Wayne, a co-founder of Apple, sold his stake in the company for $800 in 1976. That stock would today have been worth about $90 billion today, making him one of the richest men in the world.  Even if an executive or founder does want to sell stock, they need to be careful about not timing any sales to create the impression that they have lost faith in the company, or were trading on nonpublic information.  Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich recently drew scrutiny for selling about $39 million worth of shares after the company learned of a major security flaw in its chips, but before the news was made public.  Intel said the sale was unrelated to security issues and was part of a prearranged annual trading plan.

Sophisticated financial planners have myriad ways to minimize risk, beyond simply diversifying. Executives with large stock holdings can hedge their positions, minimizing downside risk. Sometimes it\u2019s possible to sell upside call options.  And in so-called exchange funds, executives from various companies will pool their stock into a fund run by an asset manager, diversifying their exposure without having to sell shares and pay any immediate capital gains taxes.  Even then, however, undue complexity can backfire. In 2012, the founder of Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, Robert Stiller, was ousted as chairman of his own company after he sold five million shares, worth about $125 million. His motivation: he had taken out loans against his sizable stake in Green Mountain, now known as Keurig Green Mountain, but when the value of the shares fell, Mr. Stiller was caught in a margin call.  The most common pitfall for executives who are rewarded with stock, however, is simply ignorance. Too often, planners say, executives don\u2019t know what they have, or what options they are entitled to. Frequently, people become aware of their options only at the last minute, or even after the fact.  \u201cThe worst-case scenario is that those options expire in the money,\u201d said Mr. Senseney. \u201cWaiting too long can be devastating.

A Tesla representative declined to comment on the company\u2019s finances.  But the company\u2019s recent troubles extend beyond its balance sheet. Federal investigators are looking into a fiery crash that killed a Tesla driver last week in California, including the possibility that Autopilot was in use. (Autopilot was in use during a 2016 crash in Florida that killed a Tesla driver, but safety officials concluded that the crash did not result from a flaw in the system but found it lacked safeguards to prevent its misuse.)  And on Thursday, Tesla said it was recalling 123,000 Model S cars made before April 2016 to replace bolts that hold a power-steering motor in place. The bolts can become corroded and break, leaving drivers with only manual steering. The company said no crashes or injuries related to the issue had been reported.  Tesla\u2019s reversal of fortune is a jolt for both the company and its chief executive, who had built a reputation not only as a visionary but also as an achiever, masterminding an automotive brand, breaking ground on a battery plant that would be the world\u2019s biggest building, and launching rockets through his SpaceX venture.  For years, Tesla has ridden a wave of enthusiastic support from its customers and a certain set of investors, even though it generated barely any profit in the 15 years since its founding. Company events to present new models tend to have the feel of a religious revival, with hundreds or thousands of owners cheering wildly at each new pronouncement from Mr. Musk. Anticipation for the Model 3 prompted nearly 400,000 prospective customers to put down deposits of $1,000 each.  In November, before a screaming audience of several hundred guests, Mr. Musk unveiled a battery-powered semi truck and a two-seat roadster. He vowed to begin producing the truck by the end of 2019, even though the company does not have a factory to build it, and is still trying to work the kinks out of the Model 3 assembly process at its manufacturing plant in Fremont, Calif.

You add all that up and there\u2019s a real question about whether this company can deliver what it promises.\u201d  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  There\u2019s no doubt Tesla has achieved some breakthroughs that have left the established automakers scrambling to catch up. It has proved that there is a viable market for electric cars, and that they can command premium prices. It has pioneered methods of upgrading cars through software updates beamed over the air, the way iPhones can download new operating systems.  And it was Autopilot that set off a race to develop advanced driver-assistance systems that can guide cars under certain circumstances and actively prevent collisions \u2014 though Tesla\u2019s technology appears to have been surpassed by the self-driving systems from other companies, including G.M. and the Google spinoff Waymo.  Along the way, Mr. Musk has also courted controversy, including his move in 2016 for Tesla to take over SolarCity, a maker of home solar panels run by his cousin. A group of investors has filed a lawsuit contending that Mr. Musk had a conflict of interest because he was SolarCity\u2019s chairman, and this week a judge cleared the way for the case to go forward.  In January, Tesla gave Mr. Musk a new compensation plan tied entirely to the company\u2019s market value and other performance goals. If he hits all of the goals, he could be rewarded with stock worth more than $50 billion.  But the company has repeatedly failed to meet its own targets and deadlines, especially with the Model 3. Mr. Musk originally predicted that the Model 3 would arrive in 2017 and that the car would push the company\u2019s sales to 500,000 cars a year by 2018. He later lowered his prediction to 100,000 Model 3s in 2017. Backtracking again, he said last August that the company hoped to make 20,000 a month by December, and added that \u201cpeople should have zero concerns\u201d about Tesla\u2019s ability to increase its output of the Model 3.  But in the fourth quarter of last year, Tesla made only 2,425 Model 3s. In its most recent plan, it hopes to lift production to 2,500 Model 3s a week. The company is expected to release first-quarter production totals in early April.  The Model 3 is crucial. The company needs to ramp up its Model 3 business to generate revenue so that it can pay back investors and fund development of future vehicles including its electric truck.  Moody\u2019s concluded that Tesla probably needed to raise more than $2 billion from investors to be able to finance its operations, continue capital investment and pay debts and other financial obligations that will come due soon. According to Moody\u2019s, Tesla has $200 million in convertible bonds due later this year, and $900 million due in early 2019.  \u201cLiquidity is going to be very tight by the end of the year,\u201d Bruce Clark, a senior vice president at Moody\u2019s, said in an interview. \u201cThey need to re-establish credibility with the capital markets.\u201d", "stock": "TSLA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-29", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/29/business/tesla-elon-musk.html"}, {"article": "Technology stocks helped propel the nine-year bull market. Optimistic investors piled into the shares, hoping to grab a piece of the profits from industries such as social media, autonomous driving, video streaming and artificial intelligence.  Now, that confidence is evaporating.  Investors pummeled technology company stocks again on Tuesday, knocking the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index down 1.7 percent. The Nasdaq composite, laden with technology stocks, sank 2.9 percent after a flurry of bad news about specific companies metastasized into a broad retreat from technology stocks.  The sell-off was ignited when the chip maker Nvidia said it was suspending tests of its self-driving car technology after an autonomous Uber vehicle struck and killed a pedestrian in Tempe, Ariz., last week.

The comparison to other corporate titans  \u2022 Walmart is raising minimum hourly wage to $11, from $9; handing out bonuses; and improving parental benefits. The wage rise and bonuses will cost about $700 million.  \u2022 AT&T is handing out $1,000 bonuses to more than 200,000 employees and increasing capital spending by $1 billion.

Worth remembering: Arguably the wage raises have as much to do with tight labor markets and the desire of companies to keep existing employees or attract new ones as they do with the tax code change.  \u2014 Michael J. de la Merced  Photo  Mick Mulvaney to C.F.P.B. staff: No more envelope-pushing  From a memo that Mr. Mulvaney, who is the acting chief (or one of two, depending on whom you ask) of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, sent to the agency\u2019s staffers today:  Indeed, I think it is fair to say that the previous governing philosophy here was to aggressively \u201cpush the envelope\u201d in pursuit of the \u201cmission;\u201d that we were the \u201cgood guys\u201d and the \u201cnew sheriff in town,\u201d out to fight the \u201cbad guys.\u201d Simply put: that is what is going to be different. In fact, that entire governing philosophy of pushing the envelope frightens me a little. I would hope it would bother you as well.  And:  Writ large, I intend to exercise our statutory authority to enforce the laws of this nation. I intend to execute the statutory mandate of the Bureau to protect consumers. But we will no longer go beyond that mandate. If Congress wants us to do more than is set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act, they can change the law. Until then, we will enforce the law as currently written.  The context: Mr. Mulvaney, a longtime critic of the C.F.P.B., has been working to rein in the bureau, a longtime target of Republican ire.  \u2014 Michael J. de la Merced  Photo  Tension at the top of Airbnb  The home rental company\u2019s C.E.O., Brian Chesky, isn\u2019t always seeing eye to eye with his C.F.O., Laurence Tosi, according to an article in The Information.  In one instance, Mr. Chesky thought about starting an airline as Airbnb weighed a move into the air travel business. Mr. Tosi insisted on a lower-key approach of partnering with an existing app, according to the news site.  The context: Mr. Tosi was brought in from Blackstone to help professionalize one of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest unicorn darlings, much as Ruth Porat joined Alphabet from Morgan Stanley. That was more than likely to foster a clash between Silicon Valley idealism and Wall Street pragmatism.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  More from Cory Weinberg of The Information:  Mr. Tosi, who moved with his wife and two young children to the Bay Area for the Airbnb job, has tried to fit in, swapping Wall Street suits for jeans and vests. But his arrival also was a shock to Airbnb\u2019s culture, with its emphasis on an idealistic brand. Mr. Tosi sent marching orders across the company in 2016 that it had to get profitable. Before Airbnb could go public, it would have to have a better handle on predicting its earnings. \u201cI believe we have built this path but can do more,\u201d he wrote to employees. Mr. Tosi initiated cost-cutting efforts, including cuts to customer service and food staff, that longtime Airbnb employees saw as hurting the culture. But Airbnb\u2019s cost per customer service \u201cticket\u201d fell by 30% to 40% between 2016 and mid-2017 last year, an Airbnb official said, thanks largely to Mr. Tosi.  Why it matters: Airbnb is expected to pursue an I.P.O. as soon as next year. Which vision for the company will win out?  \u2014 Michael J. de la Merced  Was there fraud at KPMG?  The charges against five former employees of KPMG and a former government accountant show the lengths an accounting firm will go to get a good report from the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.  The indictment is a bit odd, though, because the defendants are accused of defrauding both the S.E.C. and the accounting board. They used confidential information to help deal with potential problems in KPMG\u2019s audits. But did getting a sneak peek at how they would be evaluated constitute theft, or just a form of cheating?  Fraud is a type of larceny, and normally the perpetrator obtains something from the victim, who suffers a loss. But in this case, the scheme was to help KPMG clean up its act to get a better grade in pending reviews.  In the world of white-collar crime, most fraud prosecutions involve at least some form of tangible gain to the defendants, and not a better report card. Courts have also required prosecutors to show there was at least some harm to the victim from the misuse of their property.  One way around this issue would be to charge a breach of the honest services statute, but that\u2019s not in the indictment. Nor did the Justice Department charged them under a law prohibiting the theft of government records. The S.E.C. did not accuse the accountants of securities fraud, only that they engaged in unethical or improper professional conduct.  A statement by Steven Peikin, the co-director of the S.E.C.\u2019s enforcement division, said that the defendants were \u201cliterally stealing the exam.\u201d I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s quite accurate, however, as it was more like learning when the teacher would give a pop quiz.  Is that a fraud?  \u2014 Peter J. Henning  What will Twitter do now that Anthony Noto has flown the coop?

Matt Derella, Twitter\u2019s Vice President of Global Revenue and Operations, will continue to lead the company\u2019s advertising sales efforts.

That\u2019s under a new compensation plan that Andrew reported first today. Critics, and there are many, may regard it as yet another publicity stunt by the electric car marker, which has struggled to meet production targets for its Model 3.  But Mr. Musk and the head of the Tesla board\u2019s compensation committee said the arrangement would benefit shareholders, since it\u2019s directly linked to company performance.  Here\u2019s what Mr. Musk told Andrew:  \u201cIf all that happens over the next 10 years is that Tesla\u2019s value grows by 80 or 90 percent, then my amount of compensation would be zero,\u201d he said. (His calculations were based on the stock price at the beginning of this year, when the company was worth about $50 billion.)  Trivia: California law requires that Tesla pay Mr. Musk minimum wage, even though he doesn\u2019t want a salary. So it cuts him a check for a little over $37,000 each year, which he never cashes.

Putting the Model 3 into mass production is a critical task for Tesla. The company has taken $1,000 deposits from about 400,000 customers interested in buying the car. If it can begin producing the car rapidly, its sales and revenue will soar and it could vault into profitability.  Just two years ago, Mr. Musk hoped to make 500,000 by 2018, and the ambitious forecast helped push Tesla\u2019s market value above that of General Motors and Ford Motor for a period in 2017.  In July, as Model 3 production was about to begin, Mr. Musk ratcheted back expectations, resetting his target to 20,000 vehicles a month by December. But difficulties producing battery packs at Tesla\u2019s Nevada plant, called the Gigafactory, and other glitches in the car\u2019s assembly process combined to slow output to a crawl.  Tesla built just 260 by the end of September. In January, it said it had made only 2,425 in the final quarter of 2017, and set a goal of increasing output to 5,000 a month by the end of the first quarter.  Mr. Musk said Tesla had developed a new automated production line that would be installed in the Gigafactory in March, easing hitches in supplying batteries to its assembly plant in Fremont, Calif., which was once operated jointly by Toyota Motor and General Motors.

Mr. Musk said it aimed eventually to produce 500,000 Model 3s a year.  \u201cThey haven\u2019t delivered what they\u2019ve promised, but does it matter?\u201d said Michelle Krebs, an analyst at Autotrader.com. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem to matter to their investors and the customers who\u2019ve put down deposits. When investors don\u2019t put any more money into the company, then you will know it\u2019s a problem.\u201d  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  On a positive note, Tesla reported it used up only $277 million in cash in the fourth quarter. That was down from $1.4 billion in the third quarter. On a full-year basis, however, the company used nearly $3.5 billion in cash, more than twice the amount from 2016.  The company\u2019s loss in the quarter amounted to $3.04 per share on an adjusted basis, slightly less than analysts had forecast, and $4.01 unadjusted.  Tesla has lost money in eight of the last nine quarters. Mr. Musk said he was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d that it would begin to generate net income in 2018, as Model 3 production and deliveries rose.  The company\u2019s shares were little changed in extended trading after the earnings report. They had risen 3.3 percent during the regular session.  Even if Model 3 output rises, Tesla will have to spend heavily on two future vehicles \u2014 a battery-powered semi truck and another car, the Model Y.  While working on the Model 3, Mr. Musk has continued to seek new barriers to break in other areas.  On Tuesday, his other company, SpaceX, successfully launched a heavy rocket into space. It was the first time a rocket that powerful had been launched by a private company. The Falcon Heavy is carrying a cherry-red Tesla Roadster. The rocket and the car are intended to go into an orbit around the sun, where they could remain for hundreds of millions of years.  \u201cIf we can send a Roadster to the asteroid belt,\u201d Mr. Musk said Wednesday, \u201cI think we can solve Model 3 production.\u201d", "stock": "TSLA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-07", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/07/business/tesla-musk.html"}, {"article": "\u201cOne of our priorities will be to equip our 189 dealerships with 800-volt DC fast chargers,\u201d said Klaus Zellmer, president and chief executive of Porsche Cars North America. \u201cWe have just installed six at our Porsche Experience centers in Atlanta and will roll them out at our experience center in Los Angeles, too.\u201d  As part of its settlement with the California Air Resources Board and the United States Environmental Protection Agency over its diesel emission test cheating, Volkswagen, Porsche\u2019s parent company, is also building a network of 2,800 DC fast chargers by June 2019.  Photo  The Cross Turismo introduced on Tuesday is part of the other half of this two-pronged approach. Although it is officially a concept vehicle, it is expected to be an accurate preview of what buyers will see from Porsche after the Mission E vehicles go into production next year. While no pricing has been announced, the sedan version could run close to the existing Panamera, which begins at $85,000, compared with the $74,500 base price of a Tesla Model S 75D.  The Mission E vehicles are hardly alone in jockeying for position in the premium electric market. Last week, Jaguar unveiled the production version of its fully electric I-Pace crossover, which is scheduled to glide into showrooms in the second half of 2018. The Jaguar I-Pace, the carmaker\u2019s first electric vehicle, will start at $69,500 in the United States; a Tesla Model X starts at $79,500.  Audi has announced it will ship its e-tron quattro to European showrooms this fall and to the United States in early 2019. And Volvo plans an all-electric version of its XC40 crossover in 2019.  Porsche, Jaguar, Audi and other long-established carmakers have watched as Tesla has sprinted ahead, but Tesla will soon lose one crucial benefit that the later arrivals may be able to use to close the gap: tax benefits. At some point this year, Tesla will produce its 200,000th car. (General Motors, which makes the Chevrolet Bolt EV and Volt electric vehicles, will most likely reach that mark in 2018, too.) At that milestone, federal tax credits will begin to phase out.  It\u2019s not clear whether the new upscale choices will hurt Tesla or simply expand the segment. Dave Guilford, a managing editor for Crain\u2019s Automotive News, suggested that \u201cit\u2019s probably a little bit of both.\u201d  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  \u201cYou could see when Porsche unveiled the Mission E it was aiming right at Tesla,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful car. New entries in the premium segment give it credibility.\u201d  The wagonlike all-wheel-drive Cross Turismo could be a compelling alternative to the Model X. Its 440-kilowatt system uses two permanent synchronous electric motors and a floor-mounted lithium-ion battery pack that Porsche claims will propel the Cross Turismo to 60 miles per hour in 3.5 seconds. It will also employ an air suspension that can add nearly two inches of ground clearance and rear-wheel steering that will help it in the corners. At 15 feet long, the Cross Turismo concept is about four inches shorter than the company\u2019s Macan crossover and 18 inches shorter than a Tesla Model X.  The concept\u2019s interior features a free-standing instrument cluster screen with three circular display graphics. A camera with eye-tracking ability recognizes which graphic the driver is looking at and moves it forward while reducing the size of the others. Porsche executives suggested that the technology was being considered for the production car.

For example, when a Tesla is put into Ludicrous Mode, drivers are warned of the possibility of \u201caccelerated wear of the motor, gearbox and battery.\u201d And Teslas will sometimes enter a reduced-power mode under track conditions in order to protect the battery from overheating.  Porsche intends to avoid such limitations, said Albrecht Reimold, a member of the Porsche executive board for production.

Tesla has had trouble meeting its production goals for the Model 3, the most affordable entry in its lineup. There have also been quality issues; Consumer Reports ranked the Model X among the 10 least-reliable vehicles in its survey, and there have been well-documented fit and finish problems.  That has provided an opening not just for the luxury carmakers, but for the rest of the industry to join General Motors and Nissan, which makes the Leaf electric vehicle, in challenging Tesla\u2019s Model 3. Hyundai, for example, has confirmed plans for a fully electric Kona crossover, and Buick is rumored to be gaining a small crossover based on the Chevy Bolt platform.

It\u2019s not an autonomous system. It\u2019s not a hands-free system. But that\u2019s how people are using it, and it works fine, until it suddenly doesn\u2019t.\u201d  On Saturday, Tesla declined to comment on the California crash or to make Mr. Musk or another executive available for an interview. In its blog post on Friday about the crash, the company acknowledged that Autopilot \u201cdoes not prevent all accidents,\u201d but said the system \u201cmakes them much less likely to occur\u201d and \u201cunequivocally makes the world safer.\u201d  For the company, the significance of the crash goes beyond Autopilot. Tesla is already reeling from a barrage of negative news. The value of its stock and bonds has plunged amid increasing concerns about how much cash it is using up and the repeated delays in the production of the Model 3, a battery-powered compact car that Mr. Musk is counting on to generate much-needed revenue.  It is also facing an investor lawsuit related to Tesla\u2019s acquisition of SolarCity, a solar-panel maker where Mr. Musk was serving as chairman. Meanwhile, competition is mounting from other luxury car makers that have developed their own electric cars, while Waymo, the Google spinoff, General Motors and others seem to have passed Tesla in self-driving technology.  \u201cThere\u2019s a lot going on that undermines Elon\u2019s credibility right now,\u201d said Karl Brauer, a senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book.

It can steer, brake and accelerate automatically with little input from the driver. Tesla readily points out that Autopilot \u2014 despite the implications in its name \u2014 is only a driver-assistance system and is not intended to pilot cars on its own.  Drivers are given warnings on the dashboard and in the owner\u2019s manual to remain engaged and alert while using it. Tesla originally described it as a \u201cbeta\u201d version, a term that usually refers to software still in the developmental stage.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  At the time of the Florida crash, it was possible to engage Autopilot and cruise on highways for several minutes without the driver holding the steering wheel. In that crash, the Autopilot\u2019s camera, then the primary sensor in the system, failed to recognize a white truck as it was crossing a rural highway. Tesla said the camera was confused because the truck appeared against a bright sky.  Software modifications introduced that fall included more frequent warnings to drivers to keep their hands on the steering wheel. After three warnings, the new software prevents Autopilot from operating until the driver stops, turns off the car and restarts.  The new version also made radar the primary sensor, and Mr. Musk said the new radar would have been able to see the truck in the Florida crash despite the bright sky.  Autopilot does not use lidar \u2014 a kind of radar based on lasers \u2014 that Waymo and others have maintained are crucial for fully autonomous vehicles. Mr. Musk has said he believes lidar is not necessary for Autopilot to be safe.  At least three people have now died while driving with Autopilot engaged. In January 2017, a Chinese owner was at the wheel of a Model S when the car crashed into a road sweeper on a highway.  The National Transportation Safety Board is now investigating the March 23 crash that killed Mr. Huang. Its investigation of the 2016 Florida accident concluded that Autopilot \u201cplayed a major role,\u201d and said that it lacked safeguards to prevent misuse by drivers.  An earlier investigation, by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration, said that the company\u2019s Autopilot-enabled vehicles did not need to be recalled. That inquiry, however, focused only on the question of whether any flaws in the system had led to the crash; it found no such flaws.", "stock": "TSLA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-31", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/31/business/tesla-crash-autopilot-musk.html"}, {"article": "Despite this wave of negative publicity, it seems clear that Tesla will rise or fall based on the performance, safety, design and value of its cars. If it gets those things right, all the other issues will sort themselves out. Tesla has already defied skeptics and attracted legions of die-hard fans by surmounting seemingly impossible odds to build all-electric cars that have drawn lavish praise from automotive critics.  That includes the Model 3, which Popular Mechanics named its 2018 Car of the Year. (It was a finalist for Motor Trend\u2019s similar award. That it lost out to the Alfa Romeo Giulia has drawn howls of online protest.)  When my Model 3 test vehicle pulled up to the curb on Eighth Avenue, it didn\u2019t quite stop pedestrian traffic the way opening the gull-wing doors on the Model X had, but I could see why the automotive press is so excited. The interior features a single slab of wood sweeping around the cockpit interrupted only by a touch-screen interface that houses nearly all the controls, many of them voice activated.  With its Zen minimalism, it doesn\u2019t look or feel like any other car I\u2019ve been in. The synthetic-leather seats are comfortable, and there\u2019s ample room for someone my size (6-foot-3). This all comes at a cost: $57,500 for this luxurious long-range version, far from the $35,000 base price that has excited many potential Tesla buyers.  The Model 3 may not have the rocketlike acceleration of the X, but I found it nimble and responsive. I easily accelerated from a full stop into traffic flowing at highway speed, usually a nerve-racking maneuver in a conventional car. Driving the Model 3 was such a pleasure I was reluctant to cede any control to Autopilot.  For someone with decades of experience driving a conventional car, my first taste of semiautonomous driving last fall had come as a shock. The sensation of a vehicle moving on its own was so bizarre that I instinctively gripped the steering wheel, which immediately transferred control back to me.  This time I was more relaxed, willing to see how the car would behave. I gave the voice-activated navigation system a destination (Garden State Plaza, a New Jersey shopping mall about 20 miles away), and the car accelerated, braked, stayed in the center of the lane and maintained a comfortable three-car distance ahead of me, all without my intervention. At the mall, it detected an empty parking place, and flawlessly backed into it.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  One of its most impressive features is the ability for the driver to change lanes simply by pressing the turn-signal lever. The Tesla scans for traffic in the adjacent lane, waits for an opening and then glides into place, eliminating the danger of a blind spot.

Although I\u2019d been briefed on its limitations, so successful was Autopilot that I was tempted to let down my guard by not bothering to look in the rearview mirror. That would have been a mistake.  For all its vision capabilities (including in darkness), Autopilot became confused when lanes weren\u2019t clearly marked or split in two or at exit ramps. You can\u2019t simply program the destination and let the car find its way. It\u2019s reassuringly cautious about changing lanes, but in heavy traffic, I would have missed an exit while waiting for it to find a suitable opening, and had to assert manual control.  While heading south on the New Jersey Turnpike, I could see in the rearview mirror a BMW bearing down at high speed. I pushed the turn signal for a lane change, and despite its ultrasonic sensors, the Tesla seemed oblivious to the onrushing car. It started to move into its lane; the driver laid on his horn, and I had to grab control to avoid an accident.  Blog posts indicate that other drivers have experienced the same issue.  The Tesla owner\u2019s manual describes this situation as one that the system can\u2019t yet manage. Tesla said it expected future upgrades to solve the problem, but for now, drivers need to be as attentive to the rearview mirror as with any other car.  Tesla had no comment for this column.  At this juncture, Autopilot is a misnomer, as many others have observed. \u201cThis is not self-driving technology,\u201d said Bryan Reimer, a research scientist and expert on autonomous vehicle technology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cIt\u2019s a collaborative system that leaves responsibility for safety in the drivers\u2019 hands and isn\u2019t intended to let them sit in the back seat or pursue other activities while driving.\u201d Even though some companies have said they plan driverless ride services in as little as two years, Mr. Reimer said full automation was likely to be many years or even decades in the future.  Self-driving automation systems are ranked from zero (no automation) to 5 (full automation). Tesla\u2019s Autopilot is Level 2. It requires drivers to keep at least one hand on the wheel. The car issues a prompt if it doesn\u2019t detect a hand on the wheel, and Autopilot shuts down if there\u2019s no response. In the Mountain View accident, Tesla has said, the driver \u201creceived several visual and one audible hands-on warning,\u201d but \u201cthe driver\u2019s hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds prior to the collision.\u201d  Given that this was my first extended drive using Autopilot, I was hypervigilant, maybe even more so than in a conventional car. I\u2019m told that wears off in time, as using Autopilot becomes second nature. The risk is that complacency contributes to driver inattention. Mr. Reimer and other experts are conducting research into the issue.  \u201cAs technology supplants human performance,\u201d Mr. Reimer said, \u201cthe bigger question is how safe is safe enough. If lane-changing technology is 50 percent more effective than humans, is that good enough? That\u2019s the big question no one wants to answer.\u201d  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  At the same time, he said, he worries that \u201cintense media coverage of accidents like Mountain View will scare people off.\u201d He said it was too soon to draw any conclusions from that fatality, but noted that Tesla\u2019s excellent safety record over the many millions of miles its cars have now traveled suggested that using Autopilot \u201ccan\u2019t be substantially more risky than conventional controls.\u201d (There were more than 40,000 traffic fatalities in the United States last year.)  After investigating a fatal 2016 crash involving a Tesla S and a tractor-trailer in Florida, the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration found no flaws in the Autopilot system. The National Transportation Safety Board concluded that Autopilot had performed as intended, but that the driver had become overly reliant on the technology.  After my drive in the Model 3, my sense is that even with its flaws, Tesla\u2019s Autopilot is a vast improvement over conventional controls, and enhances (rather than supplants) the driving experience. I\u2019m tempted to join the Model 3 waiting list, which numbers over 400,000 customers.  Investors, too, seem to have reassessed Tesla\u2019s recent bad news.

Model S electric vehicle on display in October 2016. On Thursday, the auto maker said it was recalling about 123,000 Model S sedans over a potential bolt issue. Photo: Vadim Ghirda/Associated Press  Tesla Inc. TSLA 2.13% is voluntarily recalling about 123,000 Model S sedans globally after discovering that certain corroding bolts in cold weather climates could lead to a power-steering failure.  The Silicon Valley auto maker on Thursday said the recall, believed to be the company\u2019s largest ever, applies to Model S sedans built before April 2016. Tesla said the issue is known to have involved less than 0.02% of the potentially affected vehicles in the U.S.  Tesla has sold about 280,000 total vehicles through the end of last year.  \u201cThere have been no injuries or accidents due to this component, despite accumulating more than a billion miles of driving,\u201d according to an email being sent to customers by Tesla. The recall to retrofit the power steering component adds to the string of challenges Chief Executive Elon Musk is dealing with as he tries to boost production of the Tesla\u2019s mass-market Model 3 sedan and conserve the company\u2019s cash supply. Moody\u2019s Investors Service this week downgraded Tesla\u2019s credit rating, concerned that the company won\u2019t meet its first-quarter goal of making 2,500 Model 3s a week. The milestone is important because further delays could crimp Tesla\u2019s cash and threaten to derail Tesla\u2019s bid to build electric cars for the masses. The downgrade, along with news this week that federal investigators were probing a fatal crash of a Tesla car, have led to a heavy selloff of the company\u2019s shares and bonds, making it potentially more difficult to raise capital. On Thursday, Tesla\u2019s stock rose 3.2%, to $266.13, during the regular trading session, and fell slightly in after-hours trading following the recall news. It has been a rough month for the stock, which has fallen about 20% over the 30-day period. Tesla is expected to reveal first-quarter production results early next week. The recall on Thursday only involves the Model S. Tesla said its service center in Montreal began noticing the issue in Model S sedans and attributed the corrosion to the calcium or magnesium salts used to treat roadways during the winter months. If the bolts fail, the car can still be steered but requires additional force. \u201cThis primarily makes the car harder to drive at low speeds and for parallel parking, but does not materially affect control at high speed, where only small steering wheel force is needed,\u201d the company said. The cost of the recall is expected to be minimal, Tesla said, with the supplier paying for the new part.

TSLA 2.13% said it updated the pay package for Chief Executive Elon Musk with a plan that again ties his compensation entirely to key performance benchmarks\u2014albeit this time much larger ones, including an ultimate goal to hit $650 billion in market value.  The pay plan, which shareholders must still approve, is designed to keep Mr. Musk as Tesla\u2019s top leader for years to come\u2014although allows for the prospect that he might evolve away from the day-to-day role of CEO into one of executive chairman and chief product officer.  The plan, which is modeled on an earlier program set for Mr. Musk in 2012, entails a 10-year grant of stock options that would vest in 12 tranches. Each would vest only if a set of two milestones are achieved, one based on market value, the other on a measure of revenue or profit. For each tranche achieved, Mr. Musk would receive shares equal to 1% of the company\u2019s total shares outstanding as of Jan. 21, 2018.  For example, the first tranche would vest if Tesla hits $100 billion in market value and $20 billion in revenue or $1.5 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, after adjusting for stock compensation. For all 12 tranches to vest, Tesla\u2019s market value would have to reach $650 billion.  Tesla, which reported revenue of $7 billion for 2016, had a market value of about $58.8 billion as of Monday\u2019s close. Mr. Musk owns about 20% of the company, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.  \u201cThis ensures that Elon will continue to lead Tesla\u2019s management over the long-term while also providing the flexibility to bring in another CEO who would report to Elon at some point in the future,\u201d Tesla said in a statement about the plan released around 12:30 a.m. on Tuesday in California. \u201cAlthough there is no current intention for this to happen, it provides the flexibility as Tesla continues to grow to potentially allow Elon to focus more of his attention on the kinds of key product and strategic matters that most impact Tesla\u2019s long-term growth and profitability.\u201d  Tesla said that if none of the tranches are achieved, Mr. Musk wouldn\u2019t receive any compensation. That would put him in similar territory to some other prominent Silicon Valley leaders who own enormously valuable stakes in their companies but receive little or no salary.  Mr. Musk\u2019s previous compensation program, granted in 2012, targeted a market value of $43.2 billion along with meeting certain milestones by 2022. It required him to remain as CEO.  Since Tesla overtook Ford Motor Co.\u2019s market value last year, and flirted with that of General Motors Co. , the Silicon Valley auto maker\u2019s valuation has been a continual point of conversation. Critics question why investors are betting so much on a company that has yet to turn an annual profit and that has delivered a fraction of the sales of much larger competitors.  Fans say they are betting on Mr. Musk\u2019s vision for personal transportation that includes electric cars that drive themselves and are powered off the company\u2019s solar panels and charged from its storage batteries.  Investor enthusiasm fueled Tesla\u2019s growth last year, even as Mr. Musk struggled to ramp up production of the Model 3 sedan, which is testing his ability to evolve the company into a more mainstream auto maker from one of a luxury niche player.  Mr. Musk has previously outlined a way for the company to reach a market cap of $700 billion, something he reiterated last year.  \u201cI could be completely delusional but I think I see a clear path to that outcome,\u201d he told analysts in May.  Mr. Musk, who also heads other companies including Space Exploration Technologies Corp., or SpaceX, has hinted that he might want to change his role at Tesla.  In May, an analyst asked Mr. Musk if he still intended to step away from Tesla after bringing out the Model 3, as he had previously suggested.  \u201cI intend to be actively involved with Tesla for the rest of my life,\u201d Mr. Musk said. \u201cHopefully, stopping before I get too old\u2014or too crazy, I don\u2019t know. But that doesn\u2019t mean I should be CEO forever.\u201d He suggested a role contributing in \u201cproduct design and technology.\u201d  Write to Tim Higgins at Tim.Higgins@WSJ.com", "stock": "TSLA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-01-23", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-gives-musk-new-long-term-pay-deal-tied-to-big-targets-1516704840?mod=searchresults&amp;page=1&amp;pos=2"}, {"article": "Tesla Inc. is expected to release fourth-quarter financial results after the market closes Wednesday. Here\u2019s what you need to know:  EARNINGS FORECAST: Tesla is expected to post an adjusted loss of $3.15 a share, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet, compared with an adjusted 69 cent-a-share loss a year earlier. Adjusted results exclude stock-based and acquisition costs, and other items.  REVENUE FORECAST: Revenue is expected to rise to $3.29 billion, according to FactSet, from $2.28 billion a year earlier. Tesla has said deliveries of the Model X sport-utility vehicle, Model S sedan and new Model 3 sedan totaled 29,870 during the quarter, up 35% from a year ago. The company delivered 1,550 units of the Model 3, which began production in July.  WHAT TO WATCH:  PRODUCTION HELL: \u201cWe believe an update on the Model 3 production ramp will be the first question on many investors\u2019 minds,\u201d James Albertine, an analyst for Consumer Edge Research, said in a note to investors. Investors have watched Tesla fall months behind in its production goals after running into bottlenecks at its Fremont, Calif., assembly factory and Nevada battery plant. Chief Executive Elon Musk once had predicted reaching a rate of production of 5,000 Model 3 vehicles a week by the end of the last year\u2019s fourth quarter\u2014a prediction that had already fallen from 20,000 in December and, at one point, as many as 200,000 in the second half of 2017. Tesla ended up making 2,425 Model 3s in the fourth quarter, the company reported in January as it pushed back the goal of reaching 5,000 a week until the end of June.  CASH BURN: Mr. Musk has long said the ramp-up of the Model 3, a sedan with a $35,000 price tag aimed at making Tesla vehicles more accessible, would generate the cash needed to fund the company\u2019s expansion. The sedan\u2019s delays put that vision at risk. Tesla began the final three months of 2017 with $3.5 billion on hand and planned to spend $1 billion during the period on capital expenditures. Earlier this month, the company raised about $550 million from bonds. Tesla executives have said they need a minimum of $1 billion each quarter for working capital. Colin Langan, an analyst for UBS, estimates Tesla can generate about $1 billion in working capital once it produces 5,000 Model 3s a week. Even so, he and others expect Tesla will need to raise additional money.  WHAT\u2019S NEXT: In recent months, Mr. Musk has generated attention talking about plans for new vehicles\u2014a two-door Roadster sports car, commercial truck and compact SUV\u2014as well as new factories in Europe and China. All would cost billions of dollars. In November, he and Chief Financial Officer Deepak Ahuja hinted at internal discussions about whether Tesla needed to back away from some of its growth plans to rein in spending. Investors are anxious for clarity about the evolving strategy. Excitement over the new products may already be helping Mr. Musk\u2019s cash situation. Deposits in the fourth quarter for the new commercial truck and the sports car, as well as a sell-down in Model S and Model X inventory, may have boosted Tesla\u2019s working capital by $700 million, according to Mr. Langan\u2019s estimates.

A still image taken from a SpaceX livestream video shows \u2018Starman\u2019 sitting in a Tesla roadster after the Falcon Heavy rocket delivered it into orbit on Tuesday. Photo: SpaceX/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images  Tesla is literally flying high after Elon Musk\u2019s successful rocket launch, which blasted a vehicle into outer space. Fourth-quarter earnings out Wednesday, however, still point to a number of challenges back here on Earth.  Tesla reported fourth-quarter revenue of $3.3 billion and an adjusted loss of $3.04 a share. That just beat the analyst consensus loss of $3.11. But a year ago, the consensus for the fourth quarter was a loss of 17 cents a share.  There were bright spots besides the earnings. Tesla burned just $277 million in free cash, a significant improvement from recent quarters. And the company managed to avoid lowering its Model 3 production forecast for a third time in three months. The cash burn appeared lower because Tesla included customer deposits for its planned new truck and roadster in its operating cash flow. That is deceiving because these deposits aren\u2019t drawn from current operations.  Meanwhile, an alarming trend of negative operating leverage has yet to reverse itself\u2014the more cars it sells the worse its margins become. Automotive gross margin fell to 13.8%, down more than 8 percentage points from a year earlier. That trend isn\u2019t likely to meaningfully reverse any time soon. Tesla forecasts about 100,000 deliveries of its older Model S and X vehicles this year, which offer better profits than the Model 3. That won\u2019t offer much, if any, growth from the 2017 tally of 101,000 cars.  The Model 3 is supposed to carry prices up to 65% below Tesla\u2019s average selling price on older products; there will have to be substantial cost-cutting and improvements in production efficiency to even hold margins constant. Meanwhile, new industry competition coming this year won\u2019t improve pricing power.  Granted, investor faith in Mr. Musk is as strong as ever, and Tesla still enjoys open access to capital markets. Fears of a crash in the stock price aren\u2019t likely to materialize anytime soon.  However, Tesla\u2019s chances of becoming a sustainable business that doesn\u2019t need constant capital markets access to survive seems less likely than a sports car in orbit.

Emergency personnel work at the scene where a Tesla vehicle crashed in Mountain View, Calif. on March 23. Tesla on Wednesday said the driver of the car was to blame, while his family said they were exploring legal options following the fatal accident. Photo: /Associated Press  Tesla Inc. TSLA 2.13% defended its semiautonomous Autopilot system in the wake of a fatal crash last month, blaming the incident on the driver after his family hired a lawyer to explore legal options.  Walter Huang died on March 23 after the Model X sport-utility vehicle he was driving southbound on Highway 101 near Mountain View, Calif., collided with a barrier and was struck by two other vehicles. The auto maker a week later said that the SUV\u2019s Autopilot was activated in the moments leading up to the crash and that the driver\u2019s hands weren\u2019t detected on the wheel for six seconds before the crash.  On Wednesday, Tesla more explicitly assigned blame to the driver. \u201cThe crash happened on a clear day with several hundred feet of visibility ahead, which means that the only way for this accident to have occurred is if Mr. Huang wasn\u2019t paying attention to the road, despite the car providing multiple warnings to do so,\u201d a Tesla spokesman said in a statement.  Earlier on Wednesday, San Francisco-based Minami Tamaki LLP announced in a statement that the family had retained its services and plans to file a wrongful-death lawsuit. The family appeared on local television on Tuesday night defending Mr. Huang\u2019s driving.  \u201cThe firm believes Tesla\u2019s Autopilot feature is defective and likely caused Huang\u2019s death, despite Tesla\u2019s apparent attempt to blame the victim of this terrible tragedy,\u201d the law firm said in a statement.  Investigators for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board are probing the crash. On April 1, the NTSB said it was unhappy with Tesla for releasing detailed information about the crash.  NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt and Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk had a recent discussion that appeared to defuse the tension. \u201cChairman Sumwalt had what he described as a very constructive conversation with Mr. Musk over the weekend,\u201d a spokesman for the NTSB said. \u201cThey discussed the investigation of the March 23 Tesla crash, NTSB investigative processes, and Tesla\u2019s work to address the safety recommendations that were issued last year as a result of the May 2016 Tesla crash in Williston, Florida.\u201d \u200bThe latter was a reference to a fatal crash involving Autopilot for which the NTSB determined Tesla shared blame.  Tesla declined to comment on the discussion.  The NTSB declined to comment\u200b on Tesla\u2019s defense of its technology in the most recent fatal crash, while NHTSA had no immediate comment.\u200bSeparately, the NTSB spokesman said the agency was investigating a battery fire linked to a Tesla Model X SUV that crashed into a garage in Lake Forest, Calif., in August 2017. The NTSB is primarily interested in the battery fire in that incident, the spokesman said. Tesla declined to comment on the battery-fire probe.  Tesla\u2019s Wednesday statement intensified its defense of semiautonomous technology amid greater scrutiny of whether humans can remain alert while using these systems. Auto makers are rolling out partially automated systems that pass control back and forth between vehicle and driver, some with technology designed to keep the driver alert, such as eye-tracking technology. Others, like Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Waymo, believe there should be no need for a human to take control in driving situations.  Autopilot, which is a collection of \u201cdriver assistance features,\u201d isn\u2019t a self-driving system. Tesla tells users in its owner\u2019s manual and in-vehicle display warnings that users need to remain alert and maintain control of the vehicle.  \u201cWe empathize with Mr. Huang\u2019s family, who are understandably facing loss and grief, but the false impression that Autopilot is unsafe will cause harm to others on the road,\u201d Tesla said Wednesday. \u201cThe reason that other families are not on TV is because their loved ones are still alive.\u201d  Tesla had said earlier that the driver took no action despite having five seconds and about 500 feet of unobstructed view of the concrete highway divider.  The 2016 fatal crash in Florida put Tesla\u2019s technology into the spotlight. The NTSB said Tesla shared partial blame for the crash, noting Autopilot allowed the driver to go long periods without his hands on the wheel and ignore the company\u2019s warnings. NHTSA, however, said the system wasn\u2019t defective and that Tesla vehicles\u2019 crash rate dropped by almost 40% after the auto-steer feature was installed. The vehicle in the 2016 accident was equipped with the auto-steer feature.  After the NTSB findings in the 2016 crash, Tesla said it would continue to be clear with current and potential customers that Autopilot doesn\u2019t render vehicles fully self-driving and that motorists must always remain attentive.

Residential solar had been on a tear, averaging 49% annual growth between 2010 and 2016, but the number of megawatts added last year dropped by 16% compared with the year before, according to new data from GTM Research, a firm that tracks renewable energy. It was the first annual decline since at least 2000, which is as far back as GTM tracks figures.  Industry executives and energy experts said the slowdown was driven by a sharp retreat by national solar installers, including Tesla\u2019s SolarCity and Vivint Solar Inc. VSLR -2.44% Those big outfits had deployed large sales forces to pitch homeowners on the benefits of rooftop solar, and heavily marketed deals to lease panels that required little to no money down.  The race to build a dominant national solar brand led companies to burn through cash. Unable to maintain that pace, companies scaled back and focused on profits over growth, or in some cases, got out of the rooftop solar business altogether.  SolarCity, purchased by Tesla in 2016, posted the largest declines. Once the clear-cut leader among solar installers, with one-third of the national market two years ago, it ended door-to-door sales last year and cut customer-acquisition spending. Its sales, as measured by megawatts deployed, fell by 38% in 2017, according to company figures, which include both residential and commercial installations.  Tesla said it was moving away from no-money-down leases and toward sales. It appears to have been passed by rival Sunrun Inc. RUN 0.35% in recent months as the top solar installer in the country, according to GTM.  \u201cWe expect growth to resume later this year,\u201d Tesla said last month.  Other companies also retreated from heavily marketing their home solar businesses, including NRG Energy Inc., NRG 0.37% which shut its business last year, and Vivint, which posted a 17% drop in residential sales volume in 2017 as it moved to prioritize profitability. Sungevity Inc. filed for bankruptcy protection last year after an aggressive growth strategy resulted in too much debt, the company said in a court filing.  The industry\u2019s sales strategies have attracted scrutiny by regulators in some states, including New Mexico, where the state attorney general, Hector Balderas, filed a lawsuit last month claiming that Vivint used \u201cfalse, misleading and fraudulent statements\u201d to sign customers up for long-term deals.  Rob Kain, Vivint\u2019s vice president of investor relations, said the company disagrees with the allegations and plans to contest them in court.  \u201cCould we have had a salesperson who was aggressive? I wouldn\u2019t be surprised,\u201d Mr. Kain said, adding that the company would have fired a salesperson for misrepresentations.  SolarCity grew with help from a hard-charging sales culture. Before being acquired by Tesla, the company, which was run by Lyndon Rive, the cousin of Tesla founder Elon Musk, tapped salespeople from the mortgage industry and Las Vegas casinos to sell solar panels, and gave them aggressive quotas, according to current and former managers and employees interviewed by The Wall Street Journal.  Last year, Tesla changed course and began selling solar panels through the same stores that sell its cars. Other sales approaches were shut down in order to \u201cfocus on projects with better margins,\u201d the company said.  Eric White, president and chief executive of Dividend Finance , a San Francisco-based company that provides loans to homeowners putting solar on their roofs, said many solar companies acted too much like Silicon Valley firms, pursuing growth at all costs in hopes of becoming leaders in a nascent market.  Mr. White said that while the industry\u2019s prior growth is \u201cnot sustainable and leaves bodies in its tracks,\u201d 5%-to-15% annual increases are achievable.  Solar energy grew rapidly in recent years as the cost of solar panels declined. The all-in cost of a typical rooftop solar system fell by 61% between 2010 and 2017 to $2.80 per watt, or roughly $16,000 for the average home system, according to the federal government.  Solar executives and industry analysts believe annual residential solar growth will resume in 2018. But two developments risk hurting sales in coming years, say industry analysts. First, new Trump administration tariffs on imported solar modules, mostly from China, are expected to marginally raise costs. Second, a federal government tax incentive to homeowners worth 30% of the value of the solar array is set to end by 2021.  Lynn Jurich, chief executive of Sunrun, said rising utility electricity rates and falling solar panel costs will drive increased interest in solar.  \u201cWe saw an unnaturally high growth rate because there was a lot of capital coming in to spend on advertising and customer origination, and not a lot of discipline on focusing on profitable growth,\u201d she said of the sector as a whole. \u201cYou suck all the advertising out of an industry and it shrinks.\u201d  Still, companies continue to spend considerable amounts acquiring customers. Sunrun estimates it spends about 28 cents on marketing for every dollar spent on purchasing and installing panels.  Sophie Karp, an analyst at Guggenheim Securities, said industrywide customer-acquisition costs were higher.  \u201cSolar is not a product that you buy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a product that gets sold.\u201d  \u2014Kirsten Grind contributed to this article.

The wreckage of a Tesla vehicle after it crashed into a barrier on U.S. Highway 101 in Mountain View, Calif., last month. Photo: stringer/Reuters  The National Transportation Safety Board expressed displeasure with Tesla TSLA 2.13% Inc.\u2019s recent disclosure that the company\u2019s semiautonomous driving system was activated before a fatal crash last month in California.  The agency, which dispatched a team last week to investigate the March 23 crash, said Sunday it is \u201cunhappy\u201d that Tesla revealed detailed information it had gleaned from vehicle logs about the collision, including its suggestion that the driver had time to put his hands on the wheel and react.  Tesla declined to comment Sunday about the NTSB statement.  The rare rebuke from the U.S. agency, which investigates significant accidents involving various transportation modes, comes amid mounting scrutiny of partial and fully automated driving technologies. The NTSB is also probing the March 18 death of a pedestrian fatally struck by an Uber Technologies Inc. self-driving vehicle with a safety operator behind the wheel in Tempe, Ariz.  Not long after the NTSB expressed its disapproval Sunday, Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk joked on Twitter that the company was going bankrupt. \u201cDespite intense efforts to raise money, including a last-ditch mass sale of Easter eggs, we are sad to report that Tesla has gone completely and totally bankrupt,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSo bankrupt, you can\u2019t believe it.\u201d  Mr. Musk\u2019s tweet, which doesn\u2019t appear to be in response to the NTSB, was timed for April Fools\u2019 Day and Easter. But it also comes at a particularly sensitive time for Tesla, which is also in a tight cash situation as it tries to ramp up production of its mass-market car, the Model 3.  Tesla is expected to report first-quarter vehicle sales numbers this week, and the market will be carefully examining the company\u2019s guidance on whether or not it can hit its oft-delayed goal, of producing 5,000 Model 3 cars each week, by the end of the second quarter. Analysts say that milestone is an inflection point for Tesla when the company can start generating cash.  Tesla\u2019s shares had surged over the past couple of years on the promise that Mr. Musk could not only deliver an all-electric car for the masses, but also fulfill his vision of creating cars that drive themselves.  Tesla\u2019s disclosure on Friday that the semiautonomous system, called Autopilot, was engaged before the fatal crash near Mountain View, Calif., immediately reignited questions about the technology. A man was killed after his Tesla Model X sport-utility traveling southbound on Highway 101 collided with a barrier and was struck by two other vehicles, according to the California Highway Patrol.  Tesla late Friday said Autopilot was activated in the seconds leading up to the crash. The driver\u2019s hands weren\u2019t detected on the wheel for six seconds before the collision, the company said. Tesla said vehicle logs showed the driver took no action despite having five seconds and about 500 feet of unobstructed view of the concrete highway divider.  On Sunday, the NTSB said it needs Tesla to decode the data recorded by the vehicle. \u201cIn each of our [past] investigations involving a Tesla vehicle, Tesla has been extremely cooperative on assisting with the vehicle data,\u201d an agency spokesman said. \u201cHowever, the NTSB is unhappy with the release of investigative information by Tesla.\u201d  Newsletter Sign-up  The NTSB said it would probe all aspects of the crash, including suggestions the driver had expressed previous concerns about Autopilot. It said it would publish a preliminary report on the investigation, likely within a few weeks of completion of field work.  \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing a thorough search of our service records and we cannot find anything suggesting that the customer ever complained to Tesla about the performance of Autopilot,\u201d Tesla said in a statement. \u201cThere was a concern raised once about navigation not working correctly, but Autopilot\u2019s performance is unrelated to navigation.\u201d  The NTSB probe won\u2019t necessarily lead to sanctions against the electric car company. The NTSB determines probable causes of accidents and makes recommendations to policy makers, but doesn\u2019t issue penalties or take other punitive actions.

The trouble is, raising it suddenly looks a lot more challenging.  Moody\u2019s Investors Service downgraded Tesla\u2019s debt on Tuesday afternoon, citing persistently negative cash flow and continued production issues with the Model 3 mass-market sedan. Moody\u2019s is keeping a negative outlook on the credit due to \u201cthe likelihood that Tesla will have to undertake a large, near-term capital raise in order to refund maturing obligations and avoid a liquidity shortfall.\u201d  Tesla\u2019s bonds due in 2025, issued just last summer, were quoted near 90 cents on the dollar after hours. Meanwhile, the stock is down 23% in about a month, making equity more expensive. There are plenty of reasons that Tesla\u2019s magic touch with the capital markets is fading fast.  For starters, Tesla\u2019s financial statements paint an alarming picture of the group\u2019s long-term viability. Tesla had $3.4 billion in cash and equivalents at the end of the year and raised an additional $550 million from bonds backed by lease payments in February. Not all of that is available for spending. Customer deposits, which are mostly refundable, topped $850 million at last count.  Tesla burned more than $3.4 billion last year in free cash, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures. If that pace were to keep up, Tesla would run out of its usable cash before this year ends. Worse still, there is reason to believe the free cash burn figure was understated.  Tesla booked $666.5 million in upfront payments to install solar-energy systems as an investing cash outflow. That normally would be an operating expense, depressing free cash flow. Tesla also has managed to flatter its operating cash flow picture by stretching its working capital. Accounts payable grew by nearly $530 million in 2017 to about $2.4 billion, while accounts receivable grew by just $15 million. The difference generated more than half a billion in cash. That was a smart move to conserve resources, but the trouble is that eventually these suppliers will demand their money. They won\u2019t be comfortable if Tesla can\u2019t meet its forecast production rate of 2,500 Model 3 cars a week by the end of the first quarter.  Newsletter Sign-up  Production issues are only one part of the Model 3 problem, however. The car doesn\u2019t seem to be in as high demand as Chief Executive Elon Musk once promised investors. Analysts at Bernstein said in a research note last week that fewer than 30% of customers who have been invited to take delivery of the Model 3 have actually done so.  And Tesla can\u2019t simply cut spending to solve its cash challenge if it hopes to ramp up production. The company has racked up about $10 billion in long- term debt and has $23 billion in total liabilities. To survive long term, Tesla needs to stop overpromising and to scale back its ambitions to goals it actually can achieve. Right now, though, it just needs more money.  More debt isn\u2019t a practical solution given the current bondholder losses. An equity raise is still possible, but the recent selloff across the tech sector won\u2019t help\u2014nor will the fact that the reality of the Model 3 has so far proven to be much less attractive than the fantasy of yesteryear.  If next week\u2019s delivery update is worse than feared, the odds of keeping the lights on through this year will get a lot longer.

TSLA 2.13% contractor has sued the auto maker claiming it hasn\u2019t been paid for work at a Fremont, Calif., assembly plant where Tesla is now trying to ramp up production of the Model 3 sedan.  American Integrated Services Inc. claims Tesla hasn\u2019t paid $513,473 for lead and asbestos abatement-related work under a $3.57 million contract signed in January 2016. It filed the lawsuit Tuesday in a California state court in Oakland.  Tesla called the matter \u201ca minor commercial dispute.\u201d  \u201cWe paid AIS for all the work we authorized them to do,\u201d a Tesla spokesman said in a statement Friday. \u201cThe additional payment they\u2019re seeking is for work that we did not authorize and that clearly was unnecessary. When we asked for documentation showing that Tesla had authorized this unnecessary work, they were unable to provide it.\u201d  The claim comes as the auto maker faces questions about its cash level while it spends heavily to ramp up production of the Model 3, a compact sedan that is designed to turn the electric-car maker from a niche player to one that sells to the masses.  Large automotive suppliers are generally loath to file claims against car makers and can often carry unpaid bills while its customer works to improve its situation, betting there will be future business to win. Small companies, however, can\u2019t always make that bet, or aren\u2019t willing to do so, especially if they don\u2019t expect to do further business with the car company.  Dennis Virag, a manufacturing consultant who has worked in the automotive industry for 40 years, said auto makers generally try to pay vendors quickly unless there is a dispute about the quality or fulfillment of a contract.  The lawsuit claims the contractor had an agreement to be paid within 30 days of receipt of invoices.  \u201cTesla purchased furnishing lead and asbestos abatement, demolition and removal and other environmental and remediation services, goods, materials, labor, supplies and equipment from on or about Feb. 19, 2017, to present,\u201d the lawsuit said.  A lawyer for American Integrated Services declined to comment, citing ongoing litigation.  Production of the Model 3 began last July and has failed to reach multiple milestones set by Tesla, including one last quarter to make as many as 2,500 sedans in a single week. Tesla on Tuesday worked to reassure investors about its capital needs for the year, saying it was on track to ramp production to around 5,000 Model 3 cars a week in about three months and that would lay the ground work for \u201cstrong positive operating cash flow\u201d in the third quarter.  \u201cAs a result, Tesla does not require an equity or debt raise this year, apart from standard credit lines,\u201d the company said in the quarterly sales report.  That update followed an April Fools\u2019 Day Twitter post by Chief Executive Elon Musk that joked the company had gone bankrupt and a report from Moody\u2019s Investors Service last week downgrading Tesla\u2019s credit rating, concerned about the company\u2019s cash levels and production delays.  The company finished last year with $3.4 billion in cash on hand after its negative cash flow averaged about $1 billion a quarter on average\u2014a pace analysts have said means the company would need to raise more money this year unless it significantly boosts production.  Tesla has more than $10 billion in debt and its accounts payable has swelled to $2.39 billion at the end of the year from $1.86 billion a year earlier.  Following Tuesday\u2019s assurance that Tesla doesn\u2019t need to raise money, several analysts said they expect the company will do so later this year. Brian Johnson, an analyst for Barclays, wrote in a note to investors that he expected Tesla would need to raise $2.5 billion in the third quarter.  \u2014Andrew Scurria and Lisa Schwartz contributed to this article.

Future cooperation could extend beyond France. A source familiar with the talks said on Tuesday that Amazon and Casino were negotiating a deal in Brazil either partnering or selling Casino\u2019s local appliance and electronics chain Via Varejo SA (VVAR3.SA).  Casino said the process of selling Via Varejo was continuing in Brazil with no new element to report and there was no partnership.  The French move, which is set to shake up the competitive local food retail market, lifted Casino shares as much as 9.7 percent in morning trade amid speculation that it could lead to a bigger deal later on.  Amazon\u2019s purchase of the bricks-and-mortar retailer Whole Foods Market Inc for $13.7 billion last year, and a deal for Amazon Prime to sell products from the British supermarket chain Morrisons (MRW.L), raised expectations that it would bid for a retailer or form a partnership in France.  Casino and Amazon said late on Monday that groceries sourced from Monoprix would be available in the Amazon Prime Now app and website through a dedicated virtual store.  The deal is limited to the lucrative Paris market and its suburbs, though Monoprix CEO Regis Schultz told a conference call that an extension to other parts of France could not be ruled out.

It has a strong focus on quality and fresh products in the mould of Whole Foods, and is a key contributor to Casino group profit.  \u201cWe consider the Monoprix product selection as exceptional,\u201d Amazon France CEO Frederic Duval said during the call.  Financial terms were not disclosed, but Schultz said a model where Monoprix does the picking of the order in store and Amazon takes care of delivery was a \u201cprofitable\u201d one for Monoprix.  Slideshow (5 Images)  COMPLEMENTS OCADO DEAL  Casino already has a delivery partnership with UK online retailer Ocado (OCDO.L), signed last year.  The two deals were complementary as the Ocado technology will allow Monoprix to address the needs of its traditional clients with a bigger basket and seeking next-day delivery. Clients of Amazon Prime, set up in Paris in 2016, are looking for fewer items and want express delivery.  Since the purchase of Whole Foods Market, expectations that Amazon could focus next on Europe have spurred French retailers to try to improve their own online offerings.  Carrefour (CARR.PA) announced in January that it would invest 2.8 billion euros in digital commerce over the next five years, six times its current investment.

I will leave to others the implications for democracy when a U.S. president singles out a company that he wants to punish, but from a business point of view, his crusade is nuts. For all of Trump's huffing and puffing, there is little he can do to inflict pain on Amazon and its chief executive, Jeff Bezos. It's amazing that he can't see it.  The president complains that Amazon doesn't pay taxes. For the most part, that hasn't been true; between 2007 and 2015, it paid a combined tax rate (for federal, state, local and foreign) of 13 percent, on par with many big companies. Last year, however, it did not pay any federal taxes. Why? It appears that Amazon was able to take advantage of some provisions in Trump's pride and joy, the tax cut he signed in December. In addition, while Amazon for years fought efforts to force it to collect state and local sales tax, it has begun doing so, even collecting from its third-party vendors. Besides, there is simply no way Trump can target one company for a different tax treatment than other companies. So much for taxes.  According to the news site Axios, Trump has mused about using antitrust law to whack Amazon. In fact, there are many people who believe that big tech companies like Amazon, Facebook and Google deserve far more antitrust scrutiny than they've gotten, and indeed, that antitrust policy needs to better reflect their enormous power. I'm one of them.  But singling out Amazon is no way to go about it. It causes antitrust experts to shrink from the subject because they don't want to be seen as doing Trump's dirty work. And it puts the Justice Department's antitrust division in a terrible spot. Having already sued to stop AT&T from buying Time Warner after Trump complained about the deal, the division's leaders would look like lackeys if they went after Amazon, too. Indeed, given the current state of antitrust law, which is very forgiving of big companies making big acquisitions, there is nothing for the government to go after Amazon for.  It's possible, I suppose, that Trump could prevent Amazon from getting government contracts. In 2013, the company successfully brought cloud computing to the Central Intelligence Agency, and it is the current front-runner for a 10-year, multi-billion-dollar cloud computing contract with the Pentagon. Other tech companies are lobbying to get a piece of the contract, and perhaps the Defense Department will conclude that it's not worth inviting the president's ire to give it to the company with the most experience and biggest market share. Fear not. Amazon had over $177 billion in revenue last year and is on track to easily top $200 billion in 2018. If it never sees another penny from the government, it will do just fine.  Finally, there is the relationship that Trump has complained about most frequently: Amazon's business with the U.S. Postal Service:  I am right about Amazon costing the United States Post Office massive amounts of money for being their Delivery Boy. Amazon should pay these costs (plus) and not have them bourne by the American Taxpayer. Many billions of dollars. P.O. leaders don\u00e2t have a clue (or do they?)! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 3, 2018  Back in 2012, the Postal Service was in deep trouble. A self-financed agency since the 1980s, it had lost $25 billion over the previous six years, and $6.5 billion in just the first six months of the year. It had three big problems. First, even though it was expected to generate its own revenue, Congress made it hard to do things that could save billions, like closing rural post offices or ending Saturday delivery. Second, Congress imposed a bizarre requirement that it pre-fund retiree health-care premiums to the tune of $5.5 billion a year. And third, fewer and fewer people were sending first-class mail.  The decline in first-class mail continues today. But postal revenue has largely stabilized at around $70 billion, and losses in 2017 were down to $2.7 billion. Why? Because despite the congressional impediments, the Postal Service has done some serious cost-cutting. Also, its package-delivery business is going gangbusters. This is almost entirely thanks to Amazon, which has started to rely on the Postal Service to get packages to customers' front doors.  QuickTake Q&A: Amazon and the Post Office  Although the terms of Amazon's postal contract have never been revealed, it is implausible that the deal costs the post office money, as Trump claims. What's more, if he thinks Amazon is getting too sweet a deal, he is actually in a position to do something about it. The Postal Service's overseer, its Board of Governors, is supposed to comprise 11 people. It currently has two: Megan Brennan, the Postmaster General, and her deputy, Ronald Stroman. Every other seat is empty.  Trump has nominated three people for the board, but even if all three were approved by the Senate, the board would still lack a quorum. And without a quorum, it can't do things like, well, renegotiate big contracts. It would be easy enough for Trump to find nominees who would vow to force Amazon to pay more. But to do that, he'd have to be paying attention to his job.  Trump's real motivation is doubtless to get back at Bezos for his ownership of the Washington Post, which regularly publishes unflattering revelations about his presidency and business life. But he really should have thought twice before going after Amazon and its CEO..  There may be some chief executives who would be rattled by attacks from the president. Bezos is not one of them. You'll notice that so far he hasn't responded to Trump's tweets, and he won't. He's too smart for that. And while Trump has managed to hurt Amazon's valuation, you would be hard-pressed to find a CEO who spends less time worrying about his company's share price than Bezos. Eventually, the market will realize that Trump's threats are toothless, and the stock will come back up again.  There is a final reason why Trump's attacks on Amazon are so misguided. If he could put aside his venom for Bezos, he might be able to see that Amazon is a company that's doing exactly what he says he wants American companies to do. It's creating jobs, not just tech jobs in Seattle but blue-collar jobs in the warehouses it has built around the country. It pays most of the tuition when workers want to learn skills that will lead to better jobs. It's in the process of choosing a second headquarters city where it will eventually employ up to 50,000 workers. It's getting into health care in an effort to bring down costs. It treats customers better than any other tech company. Oh, and its chief competitor isn't an American company but a Chinese one, Alibaba.  So go after Amazon if you insist, Mr. President. But if you keep it up, this is one crusade you may live to regret.

That means the combined cable channels trail only Amazon.com Inc. and Walmart Inc. among companies selling products in multiple categories.  Wall Street has noticed, with shares of QVC Group, which includes QVC and smaller retail brands, soaring 51 percent in the past year. The company is owned by John Malone\u2019s Liberty Interactive Corp., which lists the business as a separate tracking stock to reflect its value.  The executives running a channel whose name stands for Quality, Value, Convenience believe their business can survive because it does something that Amazon can't: \u201cYou\u2019re not going to be inspired by Amazon,\u201d said George, a 56-year-old former McKinsey & Co. partner who buys Keurig machines on QVC as birthday gifts. \u201cShopping should be joyful. It should be inspirational. That\u2019s what we can do.\u201d  On set at the QVC campus in West Chester, Pennsylvania. Source: QVC  Standing next to a clothing rack on a recent morning, QVC host Pat James-Dementri urged viewers not to wait to buy a blouse and tank-top set. Order now, she said using a familiar lure, and you can get 30 percent off. She translated the price into the channel's signature math: \u201cThree easy pays of $16.66.\u201d  In a dark room perched above the studio, producer Kevin McGovern wore a headset and monitored two screens. One tracked call volume; the other showed the colors and sizes left. The wine-colored blouse was the hot item this morning, and that real-time dashboard helped create a sense of urgency with shoppers at home. McGovern whispered into the host\u2019s earpiece, and the information went out to QVC\u2019s 100 million homes in James-Dementri\u2019s bright voice: \u201cThe wine is flying out of here!\u201d she told viewers.  While the format looks easy, a complex ballet takes place behind the scenes to make things go smoothly. There are no teleprompters or scripts. QVC hosts improvise, fielding calls and social media questions from viewers in real time. The channel features 770 products each week on the air in the U.S., and the average shopper spends more than $1,200 a year on the network\u2019s products.  \u201cQVC is a retail format that appeals to a woman who loves to shop. It would appear this woman is born every year.\u201d  QVC broadcasts every day, except on Christmas, from a 58,000-square-foot campus in West Chester, Pennsylvania, about 30 miles outside of Philadelphia. The main studio has more than 20 sets that resemble scenes torn from a Pottery Barn catalog, with plush couches and spotless kitchens. There's a 130-seat theater used for live segments with such celebrities as chef Rachel Ray or Catherine Zeta-Jones, who recently launched a home collection. A warehouse nicknamed Noah\u2019s Ark holds 300,000 items\u2014at least two of everything that QVC features on TV each day. There are parallel broadcast operations in seven countries, including China.  In one room, a headless mannequin wore a bra as part of an upcoming segment on Breezies underwear, which was to be a featured item known as \u201cToday\u2019s Special Value.\u201d On a brightly lit set nearby, Dennis Basso, a charismatic white-haired fashion designer, held up one of his dresses as the cameras rolled. \u201cI'm telling you,\u201d Basso said, \u201cthis is sooooo special.\u201d  Seated in a conference room at QVC\u2019s headquarters, George talks about the marriage with Home Shopping Network as something that will do more than save costs or unite celebrity pitchwomen: Serena Williams and Nicki Minaj sell clothing and perfume on HSN, while Martha Stewart and Ellen DeGeneres pitch home d\u00e9cor, beauty products and other items on QVC. The combined channels, George argues, will have the resources to innovate.  HSN was the pioneer in shopping by remote control instead of requiring viewers to pick up the phone or visit a website. Following the merger, George said, QVC is in talks with Comcast Corp. to enable the cable giant\u2019s 22 million subscribers to order items on the channel from their remote controls.  But that strategy will pay off only if QVC viewers keep their cable TV subcriptions. \u201cWe expect QVC to have more difficulty acquiring new customers,\u201d Citi analyst Jason Bazinet wrote in a September note that downgraded its parent company\u2019s stock to sell.  And the shoppers that are sticking around aren\u2019t young. George describes the typical viewer as an upscale woman in her 50s. A recent summary of the stereotypical QVC fan in Philadelphia magazine evoked \u201csilver-haired grannies ordering slow cookers and vibrating belly bands from landline phones.\u201d The public perception of a certain fustiness to the home-shopping demographic makes it challenging to attract millennials.  \u201cIf you go to other online retailers, it\u2019s a transaction. When you come to QVC, it\u2019s a social experience.\u201d  QVC executives insist they\u2019re mostly protected from the pressures facing both TV networks and brick-and-mortar retailers. Cord-cutters are cost-conscious young men, they say, while QVC viewers are women of a certain age with enough disposable income to afford cable-TV subscriptions and discretionary purchases. QVC executives refer to their viewers, who are about 80 percent female, simply as \u201cshe\u201d and \u201cher.\u201d  Those celebrity deals also give the channel a measure of protection by ensuring those products aren\u2019t available on Amazon. Martha Stewart\u2019s chambray blouse and electric snowblower are exclusive to the channel, and her on-air appearances are also streamed live on her Facebook page, introducing many of Stewart\u2019s fans to the shopping channel.  To reach the younger generation, QVC introduced a TV channel, Beauty IQ, that is simulcast on Facebook Live and features beauty experts who have big followings on Instagram and YouTube. In 2015, two years before the deal for the Home Shopping Network, QVC also paid $2.4 billion for Zulily, a flash sales site aimed at millennial moms.    QVC\u2019s digital strategy has started to pay off. The channel added about 417,000 new customers last quarter, the second-biggest increase for that period in 15 years. Amazon is perpetually lurking, of course. It has started to broaden Twitch Interactive, a video-game streaming site it acquired in 2014, to allow artists, chefs and musicians to sell products to their viewers. And about three-quarters of QVC shoppers are also users of the almost inescapable e-commerce site.  But analysts increasingly see QVC\u2019s future as \u201cthe anti-Amazon,\u201d in the words of Barton Crockett at B. Riley FBR Inc. Amazon is about inexhaustible selection, he said, while a 24-hour shopping show is a matter of constant salesmanship.  \u201cQVC is a retail format that appeals to a woman who loves to shop,\u201d Crockett said. \u201cIt would appear this woman is born every year.\u201d  QVC Control room Source: QVC  Some viewers tune in to just see hosts like David Venable. A 53-year-old former TV news anchor in Altoona, Pennsylvania, Venable got his start at QVC in 1993 selling patio furniture during the overnight shift. Today, he hosts two live cooking shows each week, deploying a folksy manner that evokes his southern upbringing. His nonstop patter is filled with anecdotes about how his grandmother and mother taught him to cook.  \u201cIn the Kitchen With David\u201d is one of QVC\u2019s most popular shows, drawing on average more than 2 million viewers. Wearing his apron, Venable answers questions on social media, makes new recipes and demonstrates cookware. He has sold almost 900,000 air fryers. Whenever Venable tastes a dish he really enjoys, he raises his hands and turns in a circle while saying \u201chappy dance, happy dance\u201d over and over. It\u2019s his signature move.  \u201cWe\u2019re establishing a relationship with viewers,\u201d Venable said in an interview. \u201cIf you go to other online retailers, it\u2019s a transaction. When you come to QVC, it\u2019s a social experience.\u201d  One of his most devoted fans is Cam Brockman, a 23-year-old retail sales associate in Charlotte, North Carolina. Brockman recently tweeted that she was \u201caddicted\u201d to QVC and was \u201cthe only 23-year-old wearing Denim and Co. and planning her life around David Venable.\u201d  Brockman got Venable to sign a copy of his cookbook. On Sundays, she and her boyfriend watch his show during halftime of NFL games.

But what measures can he actually take against the online retail giant?  He could push for probes of consumer protection, privacy and antitrust issues. He could also step up his support for allowing states to collect sales tax on third-party purchases from Amazon, or seek to have the Postal Service charge more to deliver packages. And he could thwart Amazon\u2019s aspirations to win a multibillion dollar Pentagon contract for cloud services.  Even with those powers, Trump\u2019s ability to act has limits. Inquiries by the Justice Department or the Federal Trade Commission could take years and bear a high burden of proof. The FTC and other enforcement agencies guard their independence, as does the board of governors of the Postal Service. Changes to the tax law would require cooperation from Congress, which just passed a tax overhaul and may have limited appetite to reopen negotiations.  The feud pits the world\u2019s most powerful man against one of the world\u2019s biggest corporations -- a global titan with $684 billion in market capitalization and more than half a million employees. At stake is its reputation, revenue and, potentially, ability to continue to disrupt markets as it reshapes retailing.  Any move made by Trump that is perceived as revenge against Amazon founder Jeff Bezos for his ownership of The Washington Post would invite comparisons to President Richard Nixon, who, at the height of the Watergate scandal, threatened the Post\u2019s broadcast licenses.  Amazon didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. While Amazon rose Thursday along with most U.S. stocks, the Trump attacks helped add to the shares\u2019 headwinds on Tuesday  and Wednesday. An 8 percent drop marked Amazon\u2019s biggest two-day decline in two years.  White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters told reporters aboard Air Force One Thursday that there are no specific plans to move against the company. \u201cThe president has expressed his concerns with Amazon,\" she said.  Seek antitrust inquiry of Amazon\u2019s dominance  If the administration opens an antitrust inquiry, enforcers would have to show the company has a monopoly in a market and that it abused its dominant position. But enforcers are intently focused on harm to consumers, and Amazon\u2019s retailing platform is beloved by its customers for its breadth and convenience.  Still, the company is not without criticism. Lina Khan, director of legal policy at Open Markets Institute, a Washington think tank that advocates for tougher antitrust enforcement, says Amazon should be scrutinized. One area of concern is the way Amazon can exploit information it collects about third-party sellers to better compete against them. Amazon can use sales data it gets from these merchants to undercut them on price or start selling its own versions of their products, Khan said.  Jeff Bezos Photographer: Peter Foley/Bloomberg  \"It\u2019s possible to believe two things: one, it\u2019d be deeply troubling and improper for Trump\u2019s personal animus toward Jeff Bezos to be the basis of an antitrust action, and two, Amazon\u2019s structure and conduct raise anticompetitive concerns worthy of an antitrust investigation,\" she said.  Trump\u2019s Justice Department already has shown unorthodox thinking on antitrust enforcement. Last year it sued AT&T Inc. to stop its acquisition of Time Warner Inc. -- which owns CNN, another frequent Trump target. The move surprised many antitrust lawyers because the two companies don\u2019t compete directly.  Competing retailers have long expressed concern about Amazon\u2019s potential to push them out of business but enforcers are skeptical when complaints come from rivals because they want to see vigorous competition in markets.  Make Amazon pay sales taxes like traditional retailers  Trump\u2019s complaints about Amazon not paying sales tax echo those of states and local jurisdictions that have complained about a loss of tax revenue as sales shift from brick-and-mortar stores to Amazon.  Trump supports bipartisan bills in Congress that would allow states to mandate collection of sales taxes because U.S. policy should ensure that \"those who are competing with Amazon are on a level playing field,\" White House spokesman Raj Shah said Thursday.  In 2017, Amazon, which also supports the bills, began collecting sales tax in states that levy them, but the company doesn\u2019t charge shoppers sales tax when they buy from third-party vendors that sell on the site. Those sales make up about half the company\u2019s volume.  States and local governments lose approximately $5 billion a year in taxes from Amazon marketplace commerce because merchants don\u2019t collect them and shoppers don\u2019t pay them after the fact, according to James Thomson, a former Amazon employee who is now a consultant for e-commerce merchants. The company doesn\u2019t break out how much revenue comes from third-party sales.  The Trump administration has also urged the U.S. Supreme Court to let state and local governments collect billions of dollars in sales taxes from online retailers. The justices are scheduled to hear arguments next month centering on a South Dakota law that calls for collecting sales taxes from large internet retailers even if they don\u2019t have brick-and-mortar stores in the state. A ruling is expected by late June.  Charge Amazon higher postage  Trump has said the Postal Service should be charging Amazon more for delivery.  \u201cWhy is the United States Post Office, which is losing many billions of dollars a year, while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages, making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer?\u201d Trump told his 45 million followers in January.  A sudden increase in postal service rates would cost Amazon about $2.6 billion a year, according to an April report by Citigroup. That report predicted United Parcel Service Inc. and FedEx Corp. would also raise rates in response to a postal service hike.  The Postal Regulatory Commission, which sets rates, has one vacant seat among its five commissioners, who are named by the president.  But the Postal Service would also be a loser. Despite Trump\u2019s assertions, Amazon is a valuable customer. And the Postal Service\u2019s losses have little to do with Amazon and more to do with its large health-care obligations and the dwindling use of first-class mail. USPS charges some of the world\u2019s lowest stamp prices.  Brad Parscale, who is managing Trump\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign, hinted that the administration may act to raise Amazon\u2019s postal costs in a tweet late Thursday. \u201cOnce the markets figure out that a single @usps rule change will crush @amazon \u2019s bottom line we will see,\u201d Parscale wrote.  Weigh in against Amazon in the Cloud Wars  Amazon, which has sought government contracts beyond the Postal Service, could also face opposition to its bid to become the sole supplier of the Defense Department\u2019s multibillion dollar cloud services award, which is slated to be made in September and for which Amazon is seen as the front-runner.  The company\u2019s 2013 cloud deal with the CIA for $600 million has put it in pole position to win the award, which could last up to 10 years and put the company ahead in the race for future contracts as the Pentagon pushes to modernize its technology.  The Pentagon\u2019s announcement earlier in March that it would choose one vendor for the contract has prompted criticism from Microsoft Corp., International Business Machines Corp. and industry groups representing rivals such as Oracle Corp.  And lawmakers charged with funding the Pentagon have asked the department to justify the single-source award in language accompanying the recent spending bill.  Trump could issue an executive action that says the government can only contract with smaller firms for instance, although the president\u2019s comments could bolster Amazon\u2019s case if it decided to bring a court challenge, said John Hudak, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution.  \"The president\u2019s own rhetoric about Amazon probably hinders his ability to use executive action,\" Hudak said.  \u2014 With assistance by Lynnley Browning, and Toluse Olorunnipa", "stock": "AMZN", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-29", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-29/amazon-in-trump-s-crosshairs-here-s-what-the-president-could-do"}, {"article": "Without having done much yet, Amazon.com Inc. is already transforming U.S. health care -- and not necessarily for the better.  The mere threat of the online giant getting into the health business prompted the country's two largest pharmacy benefit managers -- CVS Health Corp. and Express Scripts Holding Co. -- to join forces with two of its largest insurers, Aetna Inc. and Cigna Corp. These deals will put more U.S. health care under the control of fewer companies. The merging companies say this will lower costs for consumers and the country. But the reality will likely be less rosy and more complicated.  Looming Amazon is worth $200 billion more than the country's five largest insurers and three largest pharmacy benefit managers -- which will shortly be consolidated into five total companies Source: Bloomberg  That these companies can even make such deals is due partly to the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, which blocked the mergers of Anthem Inc. with Cigna and Aetna with Humana Inc. Those mega-insurers would have been too busy digesting to make big vertical deals and too large to be acquired by other insurers.  UnitedHealth Group Inc. has been another major motivator for these mergers. It successfully pioneered a strategy of aggressive diversification by buying a large PBM in 2015 and with its Optum health-services unit. The gravitational pull of its success -- it leads peers in patient enrollment, revenue growth, and market valuation -- has inspired copycats. Profit pressure on PBMs, meanwhile, likely helped make them receptive to merging with insurers.  Pole Position UnitedHealth has consistently outgrown its rivals in recent years Source: Bloomberg  But Amazon's long shadow also helped instigate these deals. With its technological prowess, long investment horizon, bottomless appetite for new business and tolerance for thin margins, any mention of its interest in health care rattles investors, particularly in the industry's middlemen.  If the deals go through, the result will be an unprecedented level of market concentration.  All three of the biggest U.S. PBMs will be tied to three of the country's biggest insurers. CVS, Express Scripts, and UnitedHealth process more than 70 percent of all U.S. prescriptions. Post-merger, three companies will insure more than 90 million people in some capacity, process more than 3.5 billion prescription claims, and generate more than $500 billion in revenue.  Not every American will have both their medical and drug benefits managed by the same company. But many more will in the years to come. These integrated companies have more information about their customers and more ability and incentive to manage the totality of their health spending.  UnitedHealth is already all-encompassing, with its continuing investment in everything from ambulatory surgery centers to physician groups. CVS and Aetna -- which will add retail pharmacies and primary care clinics to the equation -- could have an unprecedented role in patient lives.  The deal spree may continue. Anthem and Humana look lonely. While Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. focuses on retail pharmacies in the U.S., its main rival's increasing breadth puts it at an uncomfortable disadvantage.  Even if this is the end of the deal-making, the impact of what has already happened will be far-ranging. Drugmakers and providers won't enjoy negotiating with these new giants. As for consumers, drug and provider options may narrow. Aetna and CVS will want to drive people to its own clinics, as UnitedHealth already does with its own provider network.  And PBMs are more effective and profitable when more people use tightly controlled drug plans; enrollees at newly affiliated insurers may find their drug choices are more restricted. The more people PBMs can push toward or away from a given medicine, the more negotiating leverage they have with drug manufacturers.  The merging companies have claimed huge cost savings will flow to consumers from these deals, but I'm skeptical. Research suggests costs can actually end up rising in some cases of health-care consolidation. Less competition means more pricing power for the companies that remain. Markets with more insurers have lower premiums, while prices rise when hospitals buy physician groups. Though these are vertical deals, they will add to the market power of major players in already heavily consolidated industries, which seems like a recipe for monopolistic behavior.  True, reducing the number of middlemen who get a taste of nearly every transaction should theoretically cut costs. And these giants will be able to compel larger discounts from drugmakers and providers. But it would be a rather large deviation from standard capitalist practice if these conglomerates don't capture most of those savings for shareholders.  The newly merged companies will have debt to pay off and must prove to investors the deals were smart. That likely won't leave much in the way of cost savings for the average customer  Amazon and its partners say they hope to create a new and better health-care system, free of the profit motive, for their employees. But the unintended consequences of their interest in the sector will impact a far larger group of Americans much sooner.

Executives hunting for allies to protect them from Amazon's Empire have landed on Google and Microsoft Corp. Apparently the best way for a company to shield itself from Supreme Commander Jeff Bezos is to find a big brute who is slightly less of an immediate threat.  Walmart Inc. and Google last August made it easier for people to shop from Walmart using Google's voice-activated home speakers. Similar partnership announcements followed between Google and other Amazon rivals including EBay Inc. and Target Corp.  Amazon Trumps the President Corporate chiefs mentioned Amazon thousands of times in the last year, more than a certain U.S. president Source: Bloomberg  Google CEO Sundar Pichai told analysts in October that the company was devoting more attention to retailers because of their interest in cloud computing, online advertising, digital payments and other services Google (and Amazon) offer. Pichai didn't mention retailers' fear of Amazon, but he did use the term \"flywheel effect,\" which -- ahem -- is a favorite phrase of Bezos.  Diane Greene, the leader of Google's cloud business, was more direct about the company's motivations this week. At a conference, she said Google was considered a helping hand by retailers, software makers and companies in other industries that aren't eager to use Amazon's cloud service. \"Now everybody is looking at Amazon,\" Greene said. \"We're their friend.\"  That's what you'd expect Google to say, of course. But there's anecdotal evidence that some companies really are avoiding Amazon Web Services, its cloud business. Supermarket chain Kroger Co. uses Microsoft and Google cloud products, but not Amazon's. \"It doesn't make sense for us to do a ton to help grow that business for them,\" a Kroger executive told CNBC last fall. Stock analysts at Piper Jaffray have also heard financial-services and logistics companies expressing concern about using Amazon products, and going to Microsoft instead.  Run down the list of private sectors that spend the most on information technology -- health care, banking, retail, insurance -- and all of them worry Amazon is coming for them. To be sure, it's hard to quantify the Amazon fear effect on Amazon itself. Growth in the company's e-commerce sales and cloud revenue shows few signs of slowing. AWS actually reaccelerated in the fourth quarter.  Amazon Warrior Amazon's revenue reached nearly $180 billion in 2017, and it is growing at more than 25% a year Source: Bloomberg  Amazon paranoia is not new. Some companies have long avoided selling their products on Amazon or using the company's payments tools. My colleague Sarah McBride also wrote more than a year ago about retailers encouraging one another to ditch AWS over concern their money would strengthen Amazon's e-commerce operation.  What's changed is that Amazon has entered a more Death Star-ish phase. After the stunning acquisition of grocery chain Whole Foods last summer, it seemed any company or industry might be in Amazon's sights. Worries about the company's potential incursions may have motivated a $68 billion health care merger. This is not normal.  The widespread corporate fear of Amazon even got the attention of the Onion, which last year published a satirical opinion piece written by \"Jeff Bezos\" with the headline: \"My advice to anyone starting a business is to remember that someday I will crush you.\" Good advice.

And their parents. And most of their grandparents.  But one group of potential customers has eluded the world\u2019s biggest Internet retailer.  Teenagers, otherwise known as Generation Z, with their lack of debit and credit cards, their absence of bank accounts and their overwhelming preference for actually putting on clothes and going to physical stores to buy things they could purchase online, pose a big challenge to Amazon.  Amazon\u2019s answer: The internet behemoth is in early discussions with banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Capital One Financial Corp. to create a product similar to checking accounts, according to people familiar with the matter who requested anonymity. Amazon aims to tailor the accounts to appeal especially to youngsters and those who own no plastic in their wallets, the people said.  Debit Devotees Consumers between the ages of 18-24 prefer debit cards to other forms of payments Source: Total System Services Inc.  \u201cThe sooner you can start collecting information on them, the better prepared you are,\u201d said Tim Barefield, a managing director at the consulting firm Kotter International. \u201cFor Amazon, it\u2019s another way to expand their brand. Their brand is reaching out every place that their tentacles can reach out to.\u201d  The move shows Amazon\u2019s recognition that digital accounts for minors potentially lock in lifetime customers before they even leave their parents\u2019 house. Amazon is savvy about its users\u2019 life cycles. It offers new parents discounts on diapers and baby food. It gives college students discounted Amazon Prime memberships, providing free shipping and access to streaming video so young adults will already be Amazon shoppers when they start making more of their own spending decisions.  Pseudo Card  Since many young people don\u2019t qualify for credit cards, Amazon created a pseudo-debit card called Amazon Cash that lets teenagers drop off money at drugstores such as 7-Eleven Inc. and CVS Health Corp. and add it to an Amazon wallet they can use online.  But Amazon has long known the process is clunky and has wanted to take steps to make it easier for customers without bank accounts to shop on its website. Walmart Inc. and American Express Co. offer accounts called Bluebird that have made inroads with teens.  Amazon, led by billionaire Jeff Bezos, is trying to stay on top even as it had revenue of $178 billion last year, a 31 percent jump from 2016 and an almost 2,500 percent increase from 2004, when many of these potential new customers were born.  Service Charges  Children under the age of 18 typically aren\u2019t able to sign up for a bank account without parental consent. Checking accounts for high school students often come with monthly service charges and overdraft fees.  So there\u2019s a chance for Amazon to improve the banking experience, said Stuart Sopp, chief executive officer of Current, a startup that offers debit cards to teens.  \u201cI\u2019m sure Amazon is scaring the hell out of every single regional bank and credit union right now,\u201d Sopp said. \u201cThe banks have very clearly not serviced these demographics, so there\u2019s opportunity.\u201d  Check Yes Consumers said they were open to banking with Amazon, even if it came with a fee Source: Cornerstone Advisors, StrategyCorps  If Amazon could deliver a better banking experience for digitally savvy youngsters who are used to getting what they want with a few swipes or clicks, they might have banking customers for a long time, said Eric Marks, a senior director at the financial consultancy West Monroe Partners.  Amazon might also entice teens with its personal assistant Alexa. Such devices are popular among teens looking for a convenient way to pay, said Gavin Rosenberg, a senior director at the payments processor Total System Services Inc.  \u201cThe younger generations are less concerned about privacy, so they\u2019re more apt to use them,\u201d Rosenberg said.  Adults, Too  The marketing opportunity doesn\u2019t end with teenagers. The e-commerce giant could also end up persuading people to close their existing bank accounts and open a new one with Amazon, according to a Cornerstone Advisors study published in January. It would also be a chance for a bank to partner with the online gargantuan.  \u201cRight now, banks might not be offering exactly what millennials want or need,\u201d said Marielle Schurig, a financial adviser at UBS Group AG who works with high-net-worth millennials. \u201cA lot of monthly statements don\u2019t offer insights or tools to manage your records or analyze your spending to budget or save for the future\u201d -- something Amazon might provide.  Even with as much as a $10 monthly fee, 27 percent of young millennials polled said they would open an additional checking account with Amazon. One-tenth said they would close their existing account and go with Amazon.  \u201cThis is music to Amazon\u2019s ears,\u201d Cornerstone said in its report. \u201cWhy would they want to offer a free checking account when they can bundle the services of various providers on their platform -- merchants and financial services providers -- and charge a fee for it.

Though filled with less import than the company\u2019s $13.4 billion acquisition of Whole Foods Market last year, the deal was the second-largest in Amazon\u2019s history. And like all acquisitions, it gives us a rare glimpse into the way Jeff Bezos sees the future.  In the short term, Ring gives Amazon another piece in its Alexa puzzle and a leg up in its race against Google and Apple to control homes that will increasingly be filled with connected appliances. Alexa is a nice novelty now, great for serving up the weather, reading the news and hosting the occasional trivia game. But it will be really useful when it\u2019s the hub that lets people use their voice to arm their security systems, open locked doors and flash video of the person who\u2019s ringing the doorbell out front. Google understands this as well; the new $229 Nest doorbell will come with a free Google Home Mini when it starts shipping this spring.  Alexa currently works with a host of third-party smart home products. But owning Ring\u2019s varied assortment of video doorbells, security cameras and accessories allows Amazon to accelerate their development and make them exclusive to Alexa. (It bought a similar company, Blink, last year.) Amazon can also do the typical Amazon thing and lower prices, probably by incorporating the optional subscription plans for keeping recorded video into the soup of benefits that is a Prime membership.  There\u2019s also a medium-term benefit to adding Ring. Package theft, a.k.a. \u201cporch pirates,\u201d is a rampant problem in much of the country, one that has required Amazon delivery people to start emailing customers photographs of packages left by the front door, and which, in the past, has forced the company to restrict same-day delivery from neighborhoods with high crime rates. Last year, Amazon introduced a home camera and a service called Amazon Key, which automatically opens doors for verified delivery people. Amazon Key works with so-called \u201csmart locks\u201d made by other companies. Ring doesn\u2019t sell door locks just yet, but you can imagine a day when Amazon owns all the components to make such a service work.  The implications of the Amazon-Ring deal are really interesting to contemplate when we start thinking farther out. We know Amazon wants to deliver groceries. But leaving bags of kale and cartons of milk outside for hours doesn\u2019t work, and many Amazon Fresh subscribers aren\u2019t crazy about accumulating those bulky blue totes filled with dry ice. When Amazon is behind your home security system, your doorbells and door locks, Amazon workers will be able to walk in, unpack the bags and bring the milk right to the refrigerator.  But why stop with groceries? With its endless appetites, Amazon wants to expand in the massive home-services category, fertile ground for companies like Handy Technologies Inc. and Thumbtack Inc. Imagine sitting at school or in your office and being able to buzz in the cable guy or a plumber after verifying they are who they say they are with live video on your phone. Or we can go even further: The Amazon front door and security system could one day open for your trusted housekeeper, dog-walker or exterminator, and no one else.  To keep growing at 30 percent a year, Amazon has to start selling us services, not just stuff. The Ring acquisition, with its smart doorbells and security cameras, is another step along that path. Rivals should beware: Amazon\u2019s move into smart home devices is going to give all new meaning to the words \u201clock in.\u201d  This article also ran in Bloomberg Technology\u2019s Fully Charged newsletter.

One of Katz\u2019s early investors was John Doerr of venture firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. The firm was taken by the Japanese idea of keiretsu, a network of like-minded companies that support one another through partnerships and equity stakes. Audible and Amazon.com Inc. seemed like ideal candidates, Doerr told Katz when suggesting a team-up with Bezos: \u201cHe likes books, too.\u201d  Katz on the steps of a Newark, N.J., church Audible acquired and is turning into a 400-employee \u201ctechnology center.\u201d Photographer: Meron Menghistab for Bloomberg  Katz flew to Seattle and met Bezos for coffee. Audible\u2019s success, Katz acknowledged, would rely on an impending internet revolution, where both portable digital media players and the practice of downloading files over high-speed data networks became commonplace. Bezos told Katz he was focusing on selling physical books, because it\u2019d be a quicker way to go mainstream. Audible, he predicted, was an idea that would take a decade to mature.  The two men kept in touch. At various points, Bezos stepped up involvement in Audible, until Amazon bought the company outright in 2008, leaving Katz to run it as an independent subsidiary. By the time of the acquisition, Audible had created a market for book lovers doing the dishes or on a jog. \u201cI began to think you could take all this time, which is dead time, and potentially make it reading time,\u201d Katz says.  As Amazon has in the years since, Audible first built the infrastructure for a novel form of media consumption, then slowly trained customers to adopt it. While the traditional media industry was apathetic or resistant, the company gradually increased the production of its own material. Audible has continued to bet heavily on this approach, starting a division late last year to produce original content on a much larger scale.  Today, Amazon is the book industry\u2019s b\u00eate noire, while Audible and its rivals represent a tiny bright spot for the beleaguered publishing industry. Audiobook sales totaled $2.1 billion in 2016, the most recent year for which data are available, according to the Audio Publishers Association. That\u2019s about 18 percent higher from the previous year and two and a half times the market size when Amazon bought Audible.  Audible accounts for about 41 percent of all audiobooks sold, including digital and physical formats, according to researcher Codex Group LLC. Amazon also sells audiobooks directly through its website and, with Audible, accounts for more than half the market. Audible doesn\u2019t disclose financial information, but says its annual subscriber growth is in double digits. Most customers pay $15 for a monthly subscription that comes with a single audiobook. (A la carte, they often cost more than $20.) The company\u2019s library includes 400,000 titles.  For years, the company operated without any real competition on the fringes of the $26 billion publishing industry. Google and Walmart Inc., though, have recently announced plans to sell audiobooks online. Publishers are growing more aggressive about retaining the rights to produce audio versions of their books, and the price of such rights is increasing quickly. \u201cWe don\u2019t like to work with Audible. Working with Amazon is always a treacherous affair,\u201d says Dennis Johnson, co-founder of Brooklyn-based Melville House Publishing. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly concerned with their dominance in the marketplace.\u201d  Katz says there\u2019s been outcry at every technological innovation in media, from recorded music to the paperback book. He argues the creation of the digital audiobook industry benefited even his critics.  Bezos in 1997. Photographer: Paul Souders  There was an audiobooks market, kind of, when Katz began working on Audible in the mid-1990s. They came as either huge boxes of cassettes or CDs, or in more accessible versions that were brutally abridged. Katz, who\u2019d written three books by that time, was appalled by sloppily condensed audiobooks where narrators adopted the flattest affects possible. \u201cThey did things to books that, from a writer\u2019s perspective, were unconscionable,\u201d he says.  The idea for Audible occurred to him as he was hitting a wall with a book project about how technology was going to change culture. He found the ideas convincing but struggled to write about trends that hadn\u2019t yet taken hold. He also worried that he\u2019d peaked with Home Fires, a 1992 book tracking a single Long Island family from World War II to the early \u201990s. He decided to turn his latest project into a startup instead.  Enlisting the help of a college roommate who was working in Silicon Valley, Katz developed a proposal for a company that would make digital audio players, then build a store of digital audiobooks to download onto them. He raised $3 million in funding, half from Doerr\u2019s firm, and set up shop in a former dentist\u2019s office in Montclair, N.J. It was slow work. By 1999, Audible had about 3,000 listeners.  Of course, in the Pets.com era, that seemed like enough of an audience to take the company public. It raised $38 million in an initial public offering in July 1999, and watched the price of its shares double on the first day of trading. But when the dot-com bubble collapsed the following year, Audible went down with it. In its wake, the late comedian Robin Williams, who\u2019d accepted equity in Audible as payment for his work on a spoken-word comedy project, said Katz had paid him \u201cin Confederate currency.\u201d Nasdaq delisted Audible\u2019s shares in 2003.  By then, Amazon had bought 5 percent of the company, and Apple Inc. provided an even bigger lifeline when it integrated Audible\u2019s proprietary file format into early versions of the iPod. Thanks largely to the iPod, Audible\u2019s revenue surged almost sevenfold from 2001 to 2006, Katz says.  It wasn\u2019t enough. The company had lost money every year but one and lived in fear of a hypothetical well-financed competitor spending it into oblivion. In 2006, Katz began talking in earnest to Bezos about being acquired. At the time, Amazon was preparing its first major foray into digital media with the Kindle. In 2007 it bought Brilliance Audio, another audiobook publisher. In early 2008, Amazon agreed to buy Audible for about $300 million in cash. It was two years behind the timeline for maturity that Bezos had laid out when the two men first met.  Since the deal, Katz has built a prominent profile in Newark, N.J. He gives free Audible subscriptions to public school students, is turning an historic church into a 400-employee \u201ctechnology center,\u201d and enthusiastically endorses the city\u2019s pitch to put Amazon\u2019s second headquarters there. Amazon recently said Newark was one of 20 cities it\u2019s considering as a location. Katz laughingly demurs when asked whether he\u2019s called Bezos to plead the city\u2019s case. \u201cEveryone at Amazon knows my beliefs about Newark,\u201d he says.  It\u2019s sometimes unclear how close Audible wants Amazon to come. The parent company has provided relief from the public markets, capital, and access to its tech. Audible\u2019s engineers got an early look at the Echo speaker to start planning their integration into Amazon\u2019s voice-control platforms, and current and former Audible employees say the connection helped with recruitment. Yet Katz wants to ensure Audible is seen as its own entity with a separate culture. \u201cOverplaying the Amazon part of our story tends to track away from reality,\u201d he says.  In some cases, the company could stand to benefit from greater oversight. In an email to employees last November, Katz acknowledged complaints that the workplace was \u201cless of a safe space for women than it has been intended to be.\u201d Two senior executives resigned after an ensuing investigation, and the company says it will introduce new anti-harassment training, declining to comment further.  Audible is firmly entrenched as the king of its small hill. It\u2019s the only recognizable audiobook brand, and because customers pay for monthly subscriptions rather than buy each book a la carte, they\u2019re less prone to comparison shop. Audible customers, who range from subway riders to folks washing their dishes, spend an average of two hours a day with the app.  The company\u2019s hand in the retail market is even greater than it first appears. For years, Audible and Apple had a deal where Audible would provide the actual files that Apple sells through iTunes, giving Audible a cut of every sale from its most significant competitor. The deal included an exclusivity clause preventing Apple from sourcing audiobooks from other companies, and Audible agreed not to provide its files to competing platforms. Last year the two companies ended the deal after European publishers complained it was anticompetitive.  Michele Cobb, executive director of the Audio Publishers Association, says this is likely to spur competition. \u201cThere are just a lot more players than there were three years ago,\u201d she says. The most powerful rivals may be Google and Walmart, though neither company has yet mounted a serious challenge.  Competition to make audiobooks has ramped up in recent years, adding to Audible\u2019s library. There were more than 50,000 audiobooks produced in 2016, according to the APA, more than twice the number two years earlier.  The appetite for new titles has pushed up the price of audiobook rights, according to publishers. \u201cThe cost of rights has increased in recent years because of the rapid growth in the marketplace,\u201d says Troy Juliar, chief content officer of Recorded Books, which publishes about 4,000 audiobooks a year. Literary agents are increasingly interested in retaining audio rights, and publishers often refuse to sign book deals without them.  If publishers frequently choose to work around Audible, the company has also looked to lessen its reliance on publishers. In 2016 it launched a podcast service. Last year it announced it was investing $5 million in theater productions that could be easily converted into a smartphone format.  David Blum, who spent most of the past decade running Amazon\u2019s Kindle Singles operation, now runs Audible\u2019s original publishing operation. Blum\u2019s official charge is to increase the number of Audible projects that aren\u2019t simply readings of the printed word. Margaret Atwood, author of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, recently worked with Audible to write and record a spoken-word coda to the novel, and comedian David Spade is developing an audio-only memoir. \u201cWe\u2019re really trying to break the boundaries,\u201d Blum says, \u201cand go to writers and creators and artists to think outside the traditional boundaries of what is a book.\u201d", "stock": "AMZN", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-13", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-13/amazon-turbocharged-audible-s-domination-of-audiobooks"}, {"article": "The Amazon blame game took another turn on Thursday, when President Donald Trump spun the wheel back around to the U.S. Postal Service. Amazon.com Inc. is a convenient scapegoat for just about any issue. The mail is no different.  Amazon isn\u2019t killing the post office. Since signing a landmark contract in 2013 to expand their business relationship and deliver packages on Sunday, revenue has ticked up; losses are down; and shipping is just about the only growth segment in the mailbag. The Postal Service is saddled by larger issues. Sure, there\u2019s the internet, and nobody is sending postcards anymore, but the big financial dilemma is the agency\u2019s yearly obligation to set aside cash to cover health care costs for future retirees. This accounts for billions in losses.  Give Up? U.S. Postal Service makes small improvements but is nowhere close to sustainable Source: U.S. Postal Service  U.S. mail is also required to cover every American, employing carriers who roam neighborhoods six days a week (or seven, if Amazon has a package ready). The Postal Service has said it actually makes money on the Amazon deal. E-commerce revenue provides \u201cessential support to pay for the network and infrastructure that enables us to fulfill our universal service obligation,\u201d David Partenheimer, a spokesman for the Postal Service, wrote in a January op-ed. \u201cAll users of the mail benefit.\u201d  The Amazonification of U.S. Mail Shipping revenue overtook junk mail for the first time last year Source: U.S. Postal Service  Amazon rebuilt its delivery network around the post several years ago. The company operates \u201c sortation centers\u201d that complement warehouses and organize packages by zip code before sending them to post offices for the final leg of delivery. In Kenosha, Wisconsin, Amazon has a million-square-foot warehouse, connected to a 500,000-square-foot sort center with a covered conveyor belt that resembles an airport skybridge.  Ending the U.S. mail relationship would probably be a bigger setback for Amazon than for the Postal Service. On a dark day in late 2011 when the postmaster general proposed cutting 100,000 staff and shutting thousands of post offices, EBay Inc. shares dropped more than 6 percent. Amazon\u2019s deal came soon after, and radical cuts were avoided\u2014probably not a coincidence.  So the e-commerce giant got the Postal Service off life support, but any benefit beyond that is minimal. Nothing short of a complete overhaul of the mail system, some kind of bankruptcy-style financial restructuring or reneging on those health-care promises would turn the Postal Service into a sustainable business.  Maybe that\u2019s Trump\u2019s goal. Building an antitrust case against Amazon\u2014an idea the President has floated\u2014is a tall order. Amazon\u2019s five-year contract with the Postal Service could be up for renewal this year.

But no one expected him to pull in Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon, too.  News Tuesday that Bezos\u2019s Amazon.com Inc., Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co., led by Dimon, plan to join forces to change how health care is provided to their combined 1 million U.S. employees sent shock waves through the health-care industry.  The plan, while in early stages and focused solely on the three giants\u2019 staff for now, seems almost certain to set its sights on disrupting the broader industry. It\u2019s the first big move by Amazon in the sector after months of speculation that the internet behemoth might make an entry. The Amazon-Berkshire-JPMorgan collaboration will likely pressure profits for middlemen in the health-care supply chain.  Details were scant in a short joint statement on Tuesday. The three companies said they plan to set up a new independent company \u201cthat is free from profit-making incentives and constraints.\u201d  It was enough to sink health-care stocks. Express Scripts Holding Co. and CVS Health Corp., which manage pharmacy benefits, slumped 6.9 percent and 4.9 percent, respectively. Health insurers such as Cigna Corp. and Anthem Inc. and biotechnology companies also dropped.  The group announced the news in the very early stages because it plans to hire a CEO and start partnering with other organizations, according to a person familiar with the matter. The effort would be focused internally first, and the companies would bring their data and bargaining power to bear on lowering health-care costs, the person said. Potential ways to bring down costs include providing more transparency over the prices for doctor visits and lab tests, as well as by enabling direct purchasing of some medical items, the person said.  \u201cI\u2019m in favor of anything that helps move the markets a bit, incentivizes competition and puts pressure on the big insurance carriers,\u201d said Ashraf Shehata, a partner in KPMG LLP\u2019s health care and life sciences advisory practice in the U.S. \u201cAn employer coalition can do a lot of things. You can encourage reimbursement models and provide incentives for the use of technology.\u201d  \u201cHard as it might be, reducing health care\u2019s burden on the economy while improving outcomes for employees and their families would be worth the effort,\u201d Bezos said in the statement. \u201cSuccess is going to require talented experts, a beginner\u2019s mind, and a long-term orientation.\u201d  The initial focus of the new company will be on technology solutions that will provide U.S. employees and their families with simplified, high-quality and transparent health care at a reasonable costs. In the statement, JPMorgan CEO Dimon said the initiative could ultimately expand beyond the three companies.  \u201cOur goal is to create solutions that benefit our U.S. employees, their families and, potentially, all Americans,\u201d he said.  HTA Alliance  Amazon, Berkshire and JPMorgan are among the largest private employers in the U.S. And they\u2019re among the most valuable, with a combined market capitalization of $1.6 trillion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  This isn\u2019t the first time big companies have teamed up in an effort to tackle health-care costs. International Business Machines Corp., Berkshire\u2019s BNSF Railway and American Express Co. were among the founding members of the Health Transformation Alliance, which now includes about 40 big companies that want to transform health care. The group ultimately partnered with existing industry players including CVS and UnitedHealth Group Inc.\u2019s OptumRx.  Top Team  The latest effort is being spearheaded by Todd Combs, who helps oversee investments at Berkshire; Marvelle Sullivan Berchtold, a managing director of JPMorgan; and Beth Galetti, a senior vice president for human resources at Amazon.  Todd Combs Photographer: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg  Buffett handpicked Combs in 2010 as one of his two key stockpickers. Combs, 47, has been taking on a larger role at Berkshire in recent years, and Buffett has said that Combs and Ted Weschler, who also helps oversee investments, will eventually manage the company\u2019s whole portfolio. Combs also joined JPMorgan\u2019s board in 2016.  Sullivan Berchtold joined JPMorgan in August after eight years at the Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis AG, where she was most recently the global head of mergers and acquisitions, according to her LinkedIn profile.  One of the highest ranking women at Amazon, Galetti has worked in human resources at the e-commerce giant since mid-2013, becoming senior vice president almost two years ago, according to her LinkedIn profile. As of late 2017 she was the only woman on Amazon\u2019s elite S-team, a group of just over a dozen senior executives who meet regularly with Bezos, according to published reports. Previously Galetti worked in planning, engineering and operations at FedEx Express, the cargo airline of FedEx Corp. She has a degree in electrical engineering from Lehigh University and an MBA from Colorado Technical University.  The management team, location of the headquarters and other operational details will be announced later, the companies said.  Health-care spending was estimated to account for about 18 percent of the U.S. economy last year, far more than in other developed nations. Buffett has long bemoaned the cost of U.S. health care. Last year, he came out in favor of drastic changes in the U.S. health system, telling PBS NewsHour that government-run health care is probably the best approach and would bring down costs.  \u201cThe ballooning costs of health care act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy,\u201d Buffett said in Tuesday\u2019s statement. \u201cOur group does not come to this problem with answers.

If the Berkshire/JPMorgan venture is as ambitious as it seems, incumbents are in trouble.  The great and oft-heralded Amazon.com Inc. foray into health care is here, and it's not what we expected.  The company isn't diving headlong into drug distribution or becoming a pharmacy benefit manager (PBM). Along with JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Berkshire Hathaway Inc., it announced a more interesting idea Tuesday -- a new company aimed at lowering the cost of employee health coverage.  Though no one sector will face the full wrath of Bezos, this joint venture is a potential competitive threat to all of health care's many middlemen.  Bad News, Guys The vague but potentially dreadful news of an Amazon/Berkshire Hathaway/JPMorgan health care venture sank managed care and PBM stocks on Tuesday Source: Bloomberg  This isn't Corporate America's first stab at controlling ballooning health-care costs. Caterpillar Inc. runs its own PBM for employees. Forty plus U.S. companies are part of the Health Transformation Alliance, founded in 2016 to \"fix our broken health care system\" by pooling data and uniting to wrest better terms from PBMs, among other things.  But Amazon, Berkshire and JPMorgan seem to have bigger ambitions than just negotiating prices with service providers. You don't need to create a whole new company or devote significant resources to do that.  A key line in the detail-light release announcing the new company is that it will be \"free from profit-making incentives.\" That looks like a shot at PBMs and health insurers, who try to lower costs but also maximize profit for stakeholders, resulting in a perverse and very expensive system. But it could also be aimed at health-care providers, given their Byzantine pricing and the outsize share of costs they represent.  The release said the new company's \"initial focus\" will be on using technology to provide simpler, cheaper, and more transparent health care for employees of the three founding firms. Whatever that means, it seems likely the ultimate aim may be to independently design and run employee health coverage.  With nearly 1.2 million employees and hundreds of billions in combined revenue -- along with the combined expertise of three of the most successful companies in history -- Amazon, Berkshire and JPMorgan have the requisite firepower to do this.  A Bit of Muscle Amazon, Berkshire, and JPMorgan have scale and financial firepower to put behind their new health-care venture Source: Bloomberg/fililngs  Insurers and PBMs now must worry about other companies following this blueprint. Even scarier for them is the idea that the Amazon/Berkshire/JPMorgan company will eventually recruit other employers to join it. That's a real possibility, given the venture's ambition and the fact that it's creating a new company rather than a less-formal alliance. In the release, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon teased the idea of potentially helping \"all Americans.\"  Incumbents aren't necessarily doomed just yet. This venture is in its infancy, and health care is complicated. The U.S. system is opaque, fragmented, and heavily regulated. Technology is often proclaimed as a health-care cost panacea, and rarely delivers.  The most effective way to reduce health-care costs is to restrict choice. People hate when they are denied their preferred care or medicine by an insurer or PBM. Imagine the reaction (and broader brand consequences) if Amazon is doing the denying.  There's also the question of negotiating power. The triumvirate may have 1.2 million employees, but UnitedHealth Group Inc. -- to take one example -- provides or manages employee health insurance for nearly 30 million people.  But because the new company isn't initially trying to make a profit and will likely aim to avoid paying high fees to middlemen, it may not have to push provider or drug prices quite as low to get a good result. Think the difference between active and passive management, but for health care.  The pedigree of the companies involved and the current lack of detail may have me reading too much into this effort. But if it's as ambitious as it sounds, then health-care incumbents are in trouble.

From 2013 to 2016, the USPS averaged a net loss of $5.3 billion per year. The reasons behind those losses, though, are more complicated than the way Trump seems to see it. According to the president, the financial woes of the Postal Service have much to do with the deal it has with Amazon.com to deliver the internet retailer\u2019s packages.  Leaving aside Trump\u2019s claims about the Postal Service\u2019s deal with Amazon (which is not a money loser) and his probable reasons for treating it like a pi\u00f1ata (he\u2019s no fan of Amazon Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos, who also happens to be the owner of the Washington Post, a leading chronicler of this administration\u2019s foibles) the president is right to be concerned with the state of the USPS. The question is whether Trump actually wants to fix the agency or simply tweet about it. If he wants to fix it, there are a number of things he could do.  For starters, he could support a group of U.S. senators with a set of postal reform proposals that could return the agency to solvency. In late March, Senator Tom Carper (D-Del.), introduced a bill with a bipartisan co-sponsorship that would move retired postal workers into Medicare, eliminating the agency\u2019s unfunded health-care liabilities and its need to set aside huge sums to cover them. Naturally, some congressional deficit hawks have complained that this would just shift these costs from one side of the federal ledger to the other. Yet the USPS, the second-largest contributor to Medicare after the federal government, has said such a plan would only raise the government\u2019s annual Medicare costs by a 10th of 1 percent.  Ten Years of Losses Net loss, U.S. Postal Service Data: USPS; graphic by Bloomberg Businessweek  The Senate bill, introduced March 22, would also restore half of the 4.3 percent emergency rate increase on items like first-class mail that the Postal Regulatory Commission granted the agency in 2013 only to revoke it three years later. It didn\u2019t matter that first-class mail continued its inexorable decline as more people used email and pay their bills online. The result was a decline in American stamp prices, already among the lowest in the developed world, from 49 cents to 47 cents, which only added to the losses at the USPS.  These are worthy ideas, endorsed with rare unanimity by USPS management, postal worker unions, and many of the institution\u2019s largest customers. Without White House support, however, the Senate bill is likely to wither and die, a fate suffered by other promising reform proposals in recent years. The tragedy isn\u2019t that Trump has yet to express any interest in pushing such ideas, it\u2019s that he appears not to understand how the agency actually functions.  As reported by Bloomberg News, Trump expressed a desire to aides last summer to raise the Postal Service\u2019s rates for delivering Amazon packages. According to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity, Trump\u2019s staff explained to him that the Postal Service is an independent organization and its mail rates are set by a commission.  American presidents have a history of getting involved in matters postal, usually for the better. In 1792, George Washington signed the country\u2019s first postal act, which included lower rates for newspapers in an effort to create an informed citizenry. It was so effective that French political philosopher Alexis De Tocqueville praised the American postal system as \u201cthe great link between minds\u201d when he visited the country in 1831. Trump\u2019s idol Andrew Jackson was so enamored with the Postal Service that he moved it into the president\u2019s cabinet after he was elected in 1828 and stuffed it with his political supporters, a practice that continued for more than a century.  Montgomery Blair, Abraham Lincoln\u2019s postmaster general, introduced free home delivery in cities at a time when most people had to endure long lines at the post office to get their letters. Under Woodrow Wilson, the Postal Service introduced airmail in 1918, clearing the runway for the commercial aviation industry. Richard Nixon signed a bill in 1970 removing the USPS from the president\u2019s cabinet in an effort to remove it from the political hurly-burly and give it the nimbleness of a private company. Unfortunately, it was still subject to heavy-handed congressional and regulatory oversight and often struggled to break even.  In 2006, President George W. Bush signed a bill giving the USPS long overdue power to negotiate package shipping deals like the Amazon one. Unfortunately, the bill required the USPS to set aside $5 billion a year to prefund the health benefits of its future retirees. It wasn\u2019t long before the Great Recession arrived, causing mail volume to plummet.  Decline in Volume of All Mail Number of pieces Data: USPS; graphic by Bloomberg Businessweek  The financial burdens that the Bush administration imposed were clearly untenable. Yet Bush\u2019s successor Barack Obama did virtually nothing to alleviate the situation. During his 2008 presidential campaign, Obama quipped, \u201cUPS and FedEx are doing fine. It\u2019s the post office that\u2019s always having problems.\u201d Postal workers understandably took issue with his remark. Once Obama was in the White House, his administration quietly supported the USPS\u2019s plan to end Saturday delivery, which would have saved $2 billion a year. It died in Congress because it was vociferously opposed by postal workers unions and congressional representatives from rural areas who said their constituents depended on traditional mail delivery. Meanwhile, the USPS\u2019s losses mounted, and it was forced to cut hours at rural post offices and slow first-class mail delivery in a vain attempt to make ends meet.  Presidents no longer have the control over the Postal Service that they did in Jackson or Wilson\u2019s day. Today, they get to appoint its board of governors. That\u2019s about it for their formal powers, but they can use the bully pulpit to push for change. That\u2019s what Trump is attempting to do now on Twitter in his criticisms of Amazon and the USPS. The problem is that he\u2019s focused on the wrong issues. He returned to Twitter on April 2, recycling an argument made last year by Citigroup analysts who argued that, properly accounted for, the USPS was losing an average of $1.50 on every Amazon package.  It\u2019s a complicated, legalistic case based on the presumption that the USPS, which declines to disclose the agreement\u2019s terms, is essentially providing Amazon a free ride on its letter delivery network rather than requiring it to pay the full costs of the service. That notion excites people at UPS and FedEx and their investors, but few others seem to take it seriously. (The conservative Wall Street Journal editorial page, a frequent critic of the USPS, shrugged it off on Tuesday.)  The reality is that the USPS needs more customers like Amazon, not fewer. It\u2019s required by law to visit every address in the country six days a week regardless of how many bills, greeting cards, and catalogs its letter carriers lug in their sacks. With first-class mail and the junkier kind disappearing, the USPS needs something else to put through the network to make money. Postal workers have a saying: \u201cThe internet giveth, and the internet taketh away,\u201d which is to say the agency\u2019s future lies in online shopping. Amazon is the first retailer to integrate its distribution system into the Postal Service\u2019s network, constructing sorting centers around the country to funnel packages to local post offices so letter carriers can tote them to people\u2019s doors. As e-commerce continues to account for more of what Americans spend, it provides a potential path to a healthier financial future for the USPS.  This vision of the agency\u2019s future is something a shrewd president might champion, but it would require Trump to stop making dubious claims about the reasons for the Postal Service\u2019s financial difficulties. He might even admit that he\u2019s been wrong about the Amazon deal. Unfortunately, that\u2019s not Trump\u2019s style.

The online retail giant plans to roll out two-hour delivery at Whole Foods this year to those who pay for Amazon's $99-a-year Prime membership. It is the company's biggest move since it bought the organic grocer last year.  It's also precisely the action rivals have been preparing for since the day Amazon \u2014 with the Prime program that's been so successful in cementing customer loyalty \u2014 announced plans to buy Whole Foods.  Amazon shoppers can order meat, seafood and other Whole Foods grocery items through the Prime Now app and website. Deliveries started Thursday in Austin, Texas; Cincinnati; Dallas; and Virginia Beach, Virginia; and will expand nationwide this year.  While convenient, not everyone wants other people picking out their eggs or fruit. A major hurdle for companies that offer grocery delivery is getting those people to sign up, said Darren Seifer, a food and beverage industry analyst at NPD Group.  \"There are always going to be people who want their bananas a little green,\" he said.  Ade Ogbomo, a teacher in Dallas, said she orders everything from Amazon \u2014 except food.  \"I like to get it myself,\" she said outside a Whole Foods store. She worries about the possible mishaps: \"Maybe the bananas are bruised or the cookies are all broken up, and you can't really complain because you asked for it.\"  Good, though, said she thinks Whole Foods has high-enough quality produce that she's not worried about choosing items herself.  About 7 percent of U.S. households bought groceries online last year, according to NPD Group. Most of those \u2014 about three-quarters \u2014 get their orders delivered to their door; the rest pick it up at the store. NPD Group said it expects online grocery shopping to grow quickly, especially among young adults, who are more comfortable shopping online.  And grocery chains don't want to miss out when that happens.  Walmart, the country's largest grocer, is making it easier for customers to order groceries online and pick them up at the store. Target bought grocery-delivery company Shipt late last year. Kroger, the largest traditional supermarket chain, has been promoting store pickup for online orders and doing trials of home delivery.  Maggie Anderson, 38, a therapist in Cincinnati, said she has tried it at Remke, a regional chain.  \"I just did my first order online at Remke this week because I was of out of town, and that was great,\" she said. \"It saved me a whole hour and a half of time.\"  For Amazon, items will be pulled from Whole Foods stores, bagged and then delivered by Amazon drivers. Amazon, based in Seattle, said there's no extra fee for two-hour deliveries above $35, but one-hour delivery will cost $8. The company isn't saying where delivery will expand, but its Prime Now service is in more than 30 cities, including Chicago, Milwaukee and San Diego.  The announcement gives Amazon yet another way to get groceries to customer's doorsteps.  It already does so through AmazonFresh, but that requires a $15-a-month fee. And Prime Now delivers groceries from its facilities, but it has also offered grocery delivery from other physical stores, including Whole Foods rival Sprouts Farmers Market.  Whole Foods also offers delivery in some cities through a partnership with delivery service Instacart, which will continue.  Buying Whole Foods was the biggest part of a push into physical retail for the chain known for online shopping. Right after taking over Whole Foods, Amazon made a splash by cutting prices on bananas, yogurt and other items. It also began selling Kindle e-readers in some of its 470 stores, and started selling Whole Foods-branded food on its site.  Good's friend Debbie Alf, who picked up some fruit and lunchmeat on Thursday, said she's intrigued by the two-hour delivery pledge. Would she give it a try?  \"Maybe sooner than you think,\" she said. \"If I forgot something, maybe later today.\"  ____  Pisani reported from New York and Sewell reported from Cincinnati.

Amazon is set to enter the Vietnamese market by providing e-commerce services for the Vietnam E-commerce Association (VECOM), which is a group of 140 local online businesses, according to the Nikkei Asian Review.  Amazon will help these companies sell and export their products through its platform, and details of its plans are expected to come at the Vietnam Online Business Forum 2018 on March 14.  Partnering with third-party merchants is likely a precursor to Amazon entering the market with its full slate of offerings. Before launching its full marketplace and warehouse in Australia, Amazon helped Australian third-party sellers make offshore sales, and prior to recent reports that Amazon is looking to launch in Brazil, it ran a marketplace for third-party sales of electronics and appliances. The Seattle-based company may be looking to use its partnership with VECOM as a way of getting its footing in Vietnam and building familiarity with consumers before introducing its full marketplace, Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA), Prime, and more.  This launch in Vietnam suggests that Southeast Asia is a focus for Amazon's international expansion plans. Amazon also launched in Singapore, its first market in Southeast Asia, in July 2017, where it is now operating in full with Prime and Prime Now. These first two forays occurring so close to each other may mean that Amazon has grand plans for the region, which would make sense as Southeast Asia's e-commerce sales are projected to climb to $88 billion by 2025, up from an estimated $11 billion in 2017. The region is particularly valuable to Amazon because the growth of its Prime subscriber base is reportedly slowing, and international markets, especially ones with the potential of Southeast Asia, could provide a significant boost.  Amazon will face stiff competition in Vietnam, and Southeast Asia as a whole, from Alibaba and JD.com. In Vietnam specifically, Lazada, which Alibaba owns 83% of, controls approximately 30% of the country's e-commerce business, according to the Nikkei Asian Review.com. JD.com has shown interest as well, investing approximately $50 million in Tiki, a Vietnam-based online retailer that it intends to help with fulfillment, logistics, and more. The presence of both of these powerful companies will make it difficult for Amazon to succeed in Vietnam, and if the company looks to expand to other markets, like Indonesia, it will find similar situations, often with Alibaba and JD.com having a significant head start.", "stock": "AMZN", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-13", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-to-enter-vietnam-2018-3"}, {"article": "BI Intelligence  This story was delivered to BI Intelligence \"E-Commerce Briefing\" subscribers hours before appearing on Business Insider.

Amazon has been attempting to curb losses on shipping orders of low-priced items by raising shipping fees for consumer goods suppliers, Bloomberg reports.  The e-commerce giant deducts transport costs \u2014 or the cost of moving a supplier's inventory through its distribution network \u2014 from payments for bulk orders from suppliers.  But, as its shipping costs have dramatically increased over the years, Amazon is looking to shift these costs more to its suppliers, and specifically target low-cost items that are heavy and expensive to ship, like beverages and diapers.  Additionally, the e-commerce giant is planning to make it more difficult for shoppers to purchase single, low-priced items, such as toothbrushes or soap, to encourage them to add these items into a larger purchase. Some personal care and health items on Amazon are already restricted as \"add-ons,\" or items that can only be purchased with a basket size of $25 or more. However, the company is planning on designating more items as \"add-ons\" by expanding the category to include health and beauty products that cost less than $7.  Amazon is looking to curb costs because its shipping costs are skyrocketing. Although Amazon has been working to optimize its fulfillment network through various initiatives, like extending order cut-off times to eliminate split shipments, its shipping costs are still growing in the double digits. Shipping costs reached nearly $20 billion in 2017 for the e-commerce titan, growing 31% year-over-year (YoY) in Q4 alone. As Amazon looks to grow its Prime Now, one-hour, and two-hour delivery services, while keeping its reputation for free and fast shipping on all orders, its move to improve profitability on consumer goods products is a sensible one.  The retail giant is following Walmart's move to aim for profitability in shipping online orders. Walmart has already raised prices for some online goods, and recently began to push suppliers to offer more high-priced goods on its e-commerce site. Although these two companies have been in a grid-lock price war, it seems like they've come to a tipping point in terms of shipping costs.  However, each company's approach has different pros and cons, making it unclear which one will be more successful in optimizing online revenues while minimizing shipping costs.", "stock": "AMZN", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-23", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-aims-to-improve-shipping-profitability-2018-3"}, {"article": "Amazon is famous for its aggressive growth.

Software firm Daon has developed software that will allow customers to use Amazon Alexa-enabled devices, like Echo smart speakers, to send and receive peer-to-peer (P2P) transfers with their banks, according to CNET.  The tool would have customers ask Alexa to open Daon, tell the skill to check a balance or send funds, and give a name, at which point the user would be pushed to authenticate biometrically using their phone. Recipients would have to be added as a designated payee option using online or mobile banking in order to prevent fraud. Daon doesn't yet have any partners to launch the service, but is reportedly in talks with various players that could bring the tool to fruition within the next 18 months.  The move comes as the P2P payments space continues to expand, and as banks look to take a further stake in the game. Business Insider Intelligence estimates that mobile P2P volume will hit $336 billion in 2021, up from $19 billion six years earlier. As volume grows, more players are moving into the space, including banks that are part of the Zelle network, and third-party players, like Apple and Google, which are developing their own services.  As banks specifically seek to compete, a voice partnership would be a smart move, since it could give them early entry to a growing market and fast access to a wide swath of potential users. This news comes following rumors about Amazon pushing to partner with a bank to develop a checking-account-like product, which could incorporate technology like Daon's to extend functionality to Alexa products, making it a win-win for both players.  But voice-based P2P could face obstacles that are tough to overcome.  Voice payments are becoming more popular, but they still appeal to just a small share of the population. Last year, 8% of US adults had used voice commands to buy something or send money \u2014 a figure poised to quadruple by 2022, representing massive gains but still keeping adoption at just 31% of the overall population.

Daon's product has tools to counteract that, like authentication and payee designation, but even with bank branding, which might help, it likely won't be enough to overcome all fears. On top of that, these measures detract from the consumer experience by pushing them back to their mobile device to complete the payment.

The phones are usually discounted in exchange for ads to be shown on a user's lockscreen.  Future phones will not come with lock screen Amazon ads, either.  Phones purchased through the program still come pre-loaded with Amazon apps.  Amazon announced on Tuesday that it will remove the ads from the discounted Android phones on its Amazon Prime Exclusive Phones program on Wednesday.  Currently, Android phones on the Amazon Prime Exclusive Phones program display Amazon deals and offers on their lock screens. In exchange, customers get a decent discount on Android phones from well-known manufacturers, provided you're a member of the $99/year Amazon Prime program.  Discounts are always great, but it's a tradeoff that some weren't willing to make.  Previously, getting a phone through the program meant you couldn't customize the background wallpaper of the lock screen. Amazon also said that removing the ads from the lock screen will allow for these phones to support features like facial recognition and fingerprint scanners.  LG  Certain phones, like the LG G6+, are only available on Amazon's Exclusive Phone program. Others, like the Moto G5 Plus and Moto E4 are available from Motorola's online store. Essentially, it means that Amazon Prime members can now buy certain Android phones for a lower cost than almost anywhere else, without the compromise of dealing with Amazon ads on their lock screens.  For example, the Moto G5 Plus costs $200 on Amazon's program, whereas it costs $230 from Motorola's site. And the $500 LG G6+, an Amazon exclusive, is a larger version of the LG G6, which costs $600 or more.  Still, the phones will continue to come pre-loaded with Amazon apps, so you're still buying into the retailer's ecosystem.  As of Tuesday, you have a pretty decent choice of phones from the Amazon Exclusive Phones program. With that said, newer phones models from companies like LG and Moto are expected to be released soon, so it may be wiser to wait for the newer models when they arrive on the Amazon Exclusive Phone program.

Mario Tama/Getty Images  Amazon's fourth-quarter results, which it announced Thursday, topped analyst expectations.  The company's cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services, grew rapidly and again provided the bulk of Amazon's profits.  Investors cheered the results, sending the company's stock up 6% in after-hours trading.  Amazon's stock jumped more than 6% after the e-commerce giant topped Wall Street's fourth-quarter expectations.  The company reported its holiday-period results on Thursday afternoon. At the time of writing, Amazon's stock was up $85.00 a share, or 6.1%, to $1,475.00.  Here's what the company reported, compared with what analysts polled by Bloomberg had forecast:  Revenue: $60.5 billion; analysts were expecting $59.85 billion.  $60.5 billion; analysts were expecting $59.85 billion. Amazon Web Services sales: $5.1 billion; the one analyst who offered an estimate to Bloomberg was looking for $5 billion.  $5.1 billion; the one analyst who offered an estimate to Bloomberg was looking for $5 billion. Earnings per share: $3.75; analysts were expecting $1.83 a share. The company's bottom line was boosted by a windfall of $789 million \u2014 or $1.59 a share \u2014 related to the new tax law. Without that benefit, the company would have earned $2.15 a share, beating estimates regardless.  Amazon also shared its guidance for the first quarter of 2018:  Revenue (Q1 projected): Between $47.75 billion and $50.75 billion; Wall Street had projected $48.7 billion. Amazon posted $35.7 billion in revenue in the first quarter of 2017.  Between $47.75 billion and $50.75 billion; Wall Street had projected $48.7 billion. Amazon posted $35.7 billion in revenue in the first quarter of 2017. Operating income (Q1 projected): Between $300 million and $1 billion. Amazon posted $1 billion in operating income in the first quarter last year.  The company's results showed once again the strength of AWS \u2014 and its importance to Amazon's bottom line. Revenue from the company's cloud business grew 45% in the fourth quarter from the same period a year earlier.  Meanwhile, AWS's operating income grew by 46%, to $1.4 billion. That means AWS accounted for 73% of the net income Amazon posted for the period.  Amazon gave only scant details about Whole Foods, the grocery chain it bought last year. The internet company's physical stores, which are largely its Whole Foods outlets, collectively brought in $4.5 billion in sales in the holiday quarter.  By comparison, Whole Foods as a standalone company brought in $4.9 billion in sales in its fiscal first quarter of 2017, approximately the same period a year earlier. But the sales results were actually ahead of Amazon's forecasts, Brian Olsavsky, Amazon's chief financial officer, said on a conference call with investors.  For the quarter, Whole Foods posted a small operational loss, thanks to some non-cash charges, Olsavsky said. Whole Foods earned $95 million in its comparable quarter a year earlier.  Amazon is focusing on cutting prices at the grocery chain, even beyond those it rolled out immediately after taking control of Whole Foods last August, Olsavsky said. But its integration of Whole Foods is continuing apace, he suggested.  The company has already placed some of its automated lockers \u2014 which customers can use to pick up products or return products they've ordered online \u2014 in Whole Foods stores. It plans to list Whole Foods products on the Amazon website and to introduce a customer rewards program, Olsavsky said.  \"Well have more later in the year,\" he said. He continued: \"There's much more to come.\"  Some analysts and investors were skeptical about Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods and have been wondering how far along the company is in integrating Whole Foods into the rest of its operations.

LinkedIn considered \"interest in the company, engagement with the company's employees, job demand and employee retention\" to come up with these results.

To compile the list, LinkedIn takes into account things like \"interest in the company, engagement with the company's employees, job demand and employee retention.\" That means the study was not based on reputation as gathered by a survey, but instead on how people actually use and interact with companies on LinkedIn.

Employment is diverse at Amazon. Its Seattle headquarters employs about 40,000 people, but the company also has corporate offices in many major cities across the country. Warehouse employees round out the rest of the workforce, making Amazon the US' second-largest employer at 566,000 strong.  Amazon is growing so much and so quickly that it's now looking for a second headquarters. It's narrowed the possibilities down to 20 cities for what has be ome known as its HQ2 project. Amazon has promised a $5 billion investment and 50,000 jobs for wherever HQ2 is built.  Employment at Amazon isn't all rainbows and unicorns, however. The company's Day 1 philosophy means that things can change quickly. The company eliminated some positions earlier this year while offering employment elsewhere in the company.  It also means that working at Amazon can be demanding.

Getty/Stephen Brashear  Amazon Go is Amazon's futuristic store that uses cameras and sensors to charge customers for what they take from shelves.  Loup Ventures' Andrew Murphy thinks that Amazon will license the tech for other stores.  In this way, Amazon would have a \"Trojan horse\" into traditional brick-and-mortar retail.  Amazon may be going in another direction with its \"just-walk-out\" technology.  According to a new bit of analysis from Loup Ventures' Andrew Murphy, Amazon could leverage the technology in Amazon Go \u2014 the company's futuristic store that uses sensors, not cashiers, to correctly charge customers for what they take \u2014 in a different way than anticipated.  Instead of simply opening more Amazon Go stores, he thinks the company will instead license the technology to other retailers, which would give Amazon a \"Trojan horse into the brick and mortar retail space.\"  In this way, it would be similar to the infrastructure Amazon built with its cloud-computing platform, AWS, and its third-party marketplace offering, Fulfillment by Amazon.  Amazon is clearly interested in moving into the brick-and-mortar space, and the technology in Amazon Go could be \"a turnkey solution for automated retail,\" Murphy said.  This probably doesn't mean you're going to see the tech in general merchandise competitors like Walmart or Target, but specialty retailers, like Nike, that already sell their goods on Amazon could look to add it to their growing retail presence. It could save on labor costs, or ensure workers focus on customer service instead of rote jobs like cashing out customers.  The race to automate cashiers' jobs as Amazon Go does has the company in the \"pole position\" to cash in on what Murphy says is a $50 billion opportunity for retailers.  The technology could be a strong driver to bring more brands into the fold as the company courts more and higher-end brands to work with.  Amazon partnered with Calvin Klein over the holidays, using its Echo smart speakers in fitting rooms to answer customers' questions or change the lighting. More collaborations could be possible as Amazon's tech offering convinces more brands to work with it.

He reportedly feels that Amazon is not paying its fair share of taxes, and has previously claimed that The Washington Post is being used to cover up Amazon's supposed evasion, as Jeff Bezos runs Amazon and owns the newspaper. President Trump is also unhappy with how he believes Amazon is hurting the retail industry, and brick-and-mortar retailers in particular.  President Trump does not currently have a specific plan to attack Amazon, and one may never comes to pass, but there are several ways he could go about it.  Antitrust regulation: Amazon captures a huge percentage of US e-commerce sales and e-commerce growth, without showing signs of slowing down, which has led many to consider the case that it is a monopoly that should be broken up. Such a case would not be close to a slam dunk, as it's unclear if Amazon is a threat to competition or considered to be one under antitrust laws. But if it was successful, the resulting regulations would alter Amazon significantly.

President Trump could lead the charge on finding ways to increase Amazon's federal tax bill in order to take a bigger piece of its revenue and hinder the company.

President Trump could lead the charge on finding ways to increase Amazon's federal tax bill in order to take a bigger piece of its revenue and hinder the company. Sales taxes:Amazon collects sales tax in jurisdictions where it is required to, but online sales tax laws vary from state-to-state and city-to-city, and this complexity leads to Amazon not having to collect taxes in certain places. Additionally, in many states, Amazon does not collect taxes for sales from its third-party vendors, leaving it up to them. However, many of these merchants are unclear of their responsibilities, and therefore hesitate to charge sales tax. Although some states are looking into the missing taxes, others have yet to make an effort to solve the problem; until every affected state starts cracking down, Amazon's marketplace will continue to have a price advantage over competitors. If President Trump were to make a push for tougher online sales taxes nationwide, it could give him his desired result of a weakened Amazon.  Meanwhile, the company is still selecting the location for its second headquarters, and has fielded bids that could further shield it from taxes. Amazon has received a number of bids that feature tax breaks, the ability to keep its employees' income taxes, and likely much more, all of which would make it easier for Amazon to pay less in taxes. While these deals would be valuable to Amazon, the potentially extreme level of tax immunity they provide may lead to public backlash, which could bring on new regulations and laws that would hurt the company.", "stock": "AMZN", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-29", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-how-president-trump-could-go-after-amazon-2018-3"}, {"article": "Amazon Web Services CEO Andy Jassy Amazon  Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing division of Amazon, saw major gains in fourth quarter 2017 earnings Thursday as the tech giant tighens its lead in the cloud wars.

Walmart is now price matching Amazon on 53% of all online products, according to data from e-commerce analytics firm Profitero, reported on by Retail Dive.  Moreover, Target is matching 37% of its products to Amazon's prices, while Jet.com is matching 35%. But, even with competitors' price-matching attempts, Amazon remains a cost leader, as its prices are 10% lower than all retailers' on average.  Walmart has been pushing to undercut Amazon, and its recent efforts have been a success.  Walmart closed the gap on pricing differences with Amazon by the end of 2017, averaging only .3% higher than Amazon from December 2016 to November 2017, down from 3% higher for the same period in the previous year. The retailer has also been using tactics, such as pickup discounts, to help customers save money on online orders.  Walmart's in-store prices are lower than the e-commerce titan's by 10.4% on average. Noteably, Walmart dominated in home goods and kitchen appliances, undercutting Amazon by 33% and 21%, respectively.  But competing on price may hurt the retailer's efforts to increase margins on online orders. Walmart requested that vendors offer more products priced at $10 or above in an effort to avoid taking a loss on shipping small orders. However, this move may counteract the price-matching efforts it's been making, especially among consumers who aren't brand-loyal, as online shoppers may turn to retailers that have a large assortment of low-priced items to shop from.  Walmart could see more success by offering an array of items under $10, but requiring that they be an \"add-on\" to a larger order. This would allow shoppers to get the low-priced items they're looking for, while increasing margins on shipping online orders for Walmart.  These price wars are likely to have a ripple effect across the entire retail industry, as Amazon ramps up efforts across all segments. Amazon is already stealing apparel sales from retailers, with its pricing and discounts being a major attraction to consumers. Apparel retailers are feeling the effect of this, as they struggle to move inventory and are forced to significantly markdown items. Meanwhile, the grocery segment has been fiercely competing to have the cheapest goods after Amazon entered the space via its acquisition of Whole Foods. But, as Amazon pushes its own brands, it is unlikely that any segment will be immune to the price war.", "stock": "AMZN", "label": -1, "date": "2018-04-06", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/the-retail-price-wars-are-intensifying-2018-4"}, {"article": "BI Intelligence  This story was delivered to BI Intelligence \"E-Commerce Briefing\" subscribers hours before appearing on Business Insider.

Many apparel shoppers are shifting their spending away from retailers like Target and Macy's, and toward Amazon, according to a study from Coresight Research emailed to Business Insider Intelligence.  The study found that Amazon already has a significant presence in apparel, with 46% of respondents saying they made an apparel purchase from the e-tailer in the past year. And that percentage is set to grow, as 48% expect to make an apparel purchase from Amazon in the next year.  Amazon is stealing apparel sales from big-box retailers and department stores alike.  More than 30% of Target shoppers have switched some of their apparel spending to Amazon. This high overlap makes sense because Amazon and Target are top destinations for apparel. However, Target apparel shoppers reported being more likely to shop on Amazon for apparel, and to have a Prime membership, than Walmart's customers. This puts Target and Amazon in direct competition for consumers. But both parties appear to be ready to compete, as they've been beefing up their rosters of private-label apparel brands.

This shows that Amazon is making a dent in department stores' performance, even though it may lack the stores and prestige of its competitors.  Pricing and discounts appear to be a major draw for Amazon in apparel. Forty-nine percent of apparel shoppers said they go to Amazon because it offers good value, displaying that pricing is key for Amazon in the industry. This may hinder Amazon's ability to succeed in luxury fashion, as its low-price image may not be so appealing then, but it appears to be aiding its apparel efforts overall.  Prime subscriptions may be the key for Amazon as it tries to steal customers away.Prime subscribers were much more likely to have shopped for apparel on Amazon, and to plan on doing so going forward, than nonsubscribers. This means that Amazon will have to work as hard as other retailers for non-Prime subscribers, making it even more important for Amazon to grow Prime's subscriber base. However, the number of Prime subscribers who are expecting to shop on Amazon for apparel dipped slightly from the number who made purchases last year, meaning that Amazon may need to evaluate what is causing it to lose apparel customers.

Amazon's checkout-free grocery store opens in Seattle on Monday.

The store, called Amazon Go, doesn't work like a typical Walmart or supermarket \u2014 instead, it's designed so that shoppers will use an app, also called Amazon Go, to automatically add the products they plan to buy to a digital shopping cart; they can then walk out of the building without waiting in a checkout line.

The idea is that Amazon's machine-learning technology can automatically identify when a product is added to your cart, so you don't have to do it yourself. When you leave the store, Amazon automatically charges your Amazon account.  The stores will sell ready-made food, staples like bread and milk, and other grocery products.

Amid President Donald Trump's ongoing public feud with Amazon, CNBC reports that the e-commerce behemoth has been fighting with UPS for the past few years.  The argument seems to be over the United States Postal Service's (USPS) cost structure, which has a direct impact on Amazon, its largest and most highly publicized customer, as well as UPS, which has struggled to lower its prices to match USPS' rates. Amazon's relationship with USPS directly affects the competitive landscape of parcel deliveries in the US, a market in which UPS and FedEx are the dominant players.  The dispute stems from how USPS splits up its fixed costs \u2014 including driver salaries, trucking fees, and other overhead expenses \u2014 between its two business segments. The two units are its letter business, a government-protected monopoly, and the competitive parcel business, which competes with UPS, FedEx, and other parcel delivery companies.  Under the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006, USPS is currently required to cover at least 5.5% of its fixed costs with revenue from its competitive business. Competing logistics providers, however, argue that this low-cost coverage requirement is outdated because of the explosive growth in e-commerce over the last few years \u2014 the competitive business now accounts for 30% of USPS' total revenue, up from only 11% a decade ago.  Last year, UPS argued in a filing with the Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC) that the law gave the postal service an unfair competitive advantage. That's because USPS can cover a large portion of its costs with its letter business, and therefore offer lower prices than other logistics companies.  Amazon routes the majority of its deliveries through USPS as a result of these lower rates, meaning UPS and other logistics providers are losing out on a plethora of business. Moreover, the e-tailer has argued for keeping the requirement as is, saying that a higher minimum would provide no benefits to stakeholders and isn't necessary to create a level playing field. UPS argued in its filing that the postal service's competitive business should cover a much larger share of its fixed costs, somewhere around 29%.  Tensions between the e-commerce titan and logistics companies will only intensify as Amazon moves further into the logistics market over the next few years.Amazon's well-publicized ambitions in the logistics space have grown more intense over the last few months, and will likely only continue to become more serious. It launched Fulfillment by Amazon, which allows third-party sellers to store and ship some of their products in the online retailer's proprietary logistics network, way back in 2006, and it now serves millions of retailers around the world.  Last year, the company started trialing Seller Flex in several locations on the West Coast, which took over management of its third-party sellers' deliveries to speed up delivery times and lower costs, and last month, The Wall Street Journal reported that the company is preparing to launch a stand-alone shipping service for any retailer. Amazon still has a long way to go before it even comes close to posing a direct threat to UPS, FedEx, and DHL, but as it continues to make inroads into the logistics space, it's likely that the company will only further inflame these existing tensions.", "stock": "AMZN", "label": 1, "date": "2018-04-09", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-and-ups-were-feuding-before-trump-2018-4"}, {"article": "Former Amazon executive Greg Greeley.

Amazon has been hiring house cleaners because it's testing a new housekeeping service, dubbed Amazon Home Assistants, in its home city of Seattle, Bloomberg reports.  Amazon Home Assistants' workers can help customers with tasks like cleaning, laundry, and more, and the service has been generally well reviewed by customers so far.  Hiring its own employees and creating its own unique service is a new approach for Amazon in the housekeeping space.  Amazon launched Amazon Home Services in 2015, which is a marketplace where independent contractors can offer their services under the Amazon Home Services name. The program now offers services like help with home improvement, technology installations, and house cleaning. Despite the service's expansion to all 50 states, and Amazon's claim in 2016 that the market for home services was worth somewhere between $400 billion and $800 billion, Amazon Home Services' growth has been slow, according to Bloomberg, possibly leading to the new program.  Amazon Home Assistants targets a smaller market than Home Services: US consumers were estimated to have spent $16 billion on housecleaning in 2017 by ServiceMaster Global Holdings Inc., as cited by Bloomberg. By directly employing its workers and having more control over the service, Amazon may find more success with this new offering.  Amazon Home Assistants could tie-in well with Amazon's efforts to improve package delivery security. Amazon recently launched its Amazon Key program, which uses smart technology to enable in-home deliveries even when customers aren't home.  The program aims to provide more secure deliveries, thus giving consumers more reasons to buy from Amazon. Home Assistants could help this secure-delivery initiative in two ways: Users without Amazon Key could authorize the assistants to accept packages, increasing their value and Amazon's delivery performance, or Amazon Key could make it possible for users to let the assistants into their homes without being present, incentivizing them to use Amazon Key.  The service may make consumers comfortable with Amazon having a pronounced presence in their homes, benefiting some of the company's other efforts. The e-commerce titan introduced its answer to Best Buy's Geek Squad last July through Smart Home Services by Amazon, offering consultations on what smart home products are best for consumers' homes as well as installations.  However, some consumers are uncomfortable with Amazon being in their living rooms all the time in the form of smart devices, likely hindering the service's success. With Home Assistants regularly in consumers' houses, they may be more apt to use Home Services and buy Amazon smart products, like the Echo, because Amazon will be a constant presence in their lives. This, in turn, could improve Amazon's standing in the smart home industry.", "stock": "AMZN", "label": 1, "date": "2018-04-03", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-tests-new-play-to-enter-customers-homes-2018-4"}, {"article": "BII  This story was delivered to BI Intelligence IoT Briefing subscribers hours before it appeared on Business Insider. To be the first to know, please click here.  Amazon's Alexa fund recently participated in a $62 million Series C funding round into 11-year-old smart home device manufacturer Ecobee, according to CNBC. The funding round was led by Energy Impact Partners.  The Toronto-based company primarily makes smart thermostats, but also sells sensor packages that can pair with the thermostats to help users manage hot and cold spots in their homes, and recently announced it will soon sell smart light switches. The Alexa fund, which Amazon launched back in late 2015, invests in third-party hardware companies and help them make their devices compatible with Alexa, or, in some cases, embed Alexa into their devices.  The Alexa fund was also one of the lead investors in the Series B round Ecobee completed back in 2016, and last year the device maker introduced a new thermostat that has Alexa embedded in it. This latest funding round brings the Ecobee's total funding to $146 million. Thomvest and Relay Ventures, two US-based venture firms, joined Amazon in leading the investment.  Amazon's investment comes shortly after it purchased video doorbell makers Ring and Blink, and considered buying smart lock maker August. The e-commerce titan is clearly interested in broadening its footprint in the smart home market, and likely hopes to leverage the immense popularity of its Echo smart speakers to get its users to purchase devices from companies it has acquired or invested in.  Its ongoing support of Ecobee suggests that the company is at least exploring the idea of adding smart thermostats, sensors, and light switches to its own product suite, which would allow it to build a more complete smart home ecosystem around the Echo products.  Ecobee's primary competitor in the smart thermostat space is Alphabet-owned Nest, and given that Amazon decided to stop selling Nest products through its marketplace last week, it will likely target Ecobee's devices at customers on its e-commerce site who otherwise might have purchased Nest products. Amazon may eventually look to purchase Ecobee outright the way it did with Blink and Ring, though it's unclear whether the younger firm is looking to sell.  Amazon, however, still faces an uphill battle in a fragmented market long plagued by slow growth. The company likely hopes that it can convince its loyalists and other mass-market consumers to buy smart home devices, ultimately growing the overall market. But the consumer IoT space has seen slow adoption, and many companies are struggling to turn a profit.  Meanwhile, Amazon will need to confront a fragmented market with legacy home device makers like GE and Honeywell, as well as Nest, which now has its own long line of smart home devices along with its flagship thermostats.  Amazon may struggle to turn a profit in this difficult market, but the company takes heavy losses in many other business segments, and likely finds the data it could collect on consumers' habits through its smart home devices an enticing incentive to compete. That data could be valuable for its core e-commerce business, as well as new initiatives like its recently reported package delivery service.  The US smart home market has still yet to meet the expectations many observers had in the early part of this decade.  The same issues BI Intelligence first identified back in 2015 still plague the space \u2014 persistently high prices, technological fragmentation, and consumers' lack of a perceived benefit from the devices.  But the newfound popularity of smart home voice control has revolutionized smart home ecosystems across the country, and convinces more consumers to equip their homes with smart devices on a daily basis. The Amazon Echo, released in 2014, has become immensely popular and capable, awakening users to the utility of both voice control and smart home devices. This has prompted companies to rush to release competing devices and integrate voice control into their smart home ecosystems.

In the long term, Amazon could also make the service available to merchants that sell on sites besides Amazon.  That news helped send shares of both UPS and FedEx lower on Friday, after The Wall Street Journal reported on Amazon\u2019s plans for the test in Los Angeles.  While some pundits have suggested that Amazon is on a course to kill FedEx and UPS, the reality is more complicated.

It helps arrange the transportation of freight across the ocean on cargo ships from Chinese suppliers. It has even taken a more direct role in delivering orders to customers through local couriers.  But Amazon also depends heavily on outside companies to deliver orders. The company\u2019s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, has said Amazon\u2019s business with carriers like UPS and the Postal Service is growing even as the company gets more involved.  Amazon\u2019s own shipping services have given the company a way to keep up with the growth in its business, which is especially helpful during times, like the holidays, when its carrier partners are flooded with packages. Operating its own shipping services could also offer a way to negotiate better prices with outside delivery companies. Shipping costs at Amazon last year rose 34 percent to $21.7 billion, according to Amazon filings.  Steve Gaut, a spokesman for UPS, declined to comment about Amazon\u2019s plans or whether the company\u2019s shipping volume with UPS had changed. He pointed out, however, that UPS reported 8 percent revenue growth and a 4.5 percent increase in package volume in the United States last year.  \u201cUPS continues to support Amazon and all other valued customers,\u201d he said.  Colin Sebastian, an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Company, compared what Amazon was doing in shipping to what it had done in the corporate technology market with Amazon Web Services, its cloud computing business. Slowly over time, Amazon has added more and more features to the service, but they are still well short of the offerings from established providers like Microsoft.  \u201cI think Amazon is going to find different areas within the logistics and transportation space where it can be maybe more effective or efficient than what FedEx and UPS can do,\u201d Mr. Sebastian said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re trying to establish a full competitor.\u201d", "stock": "AMZN", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-09", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/09/business/amazon-delivery-service.html"}, {"article": "Additionally, in its latest annual report to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Amazon said it paid $957 million in income taxes in 2017. The company previously reported paying $412 million in income taxes in 2016, $273 million in 2015 and $177 million in 2014, according to the commission.  Those totals can include taxes that are paid on state, federal and foreign income \u2014 although the filing does not specifically break down the amounts for each.  An analysis published in February by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy concluded that Amazon did not pay any federal taxes in 2017. It cited the company\u2019s S.E.C. filing in concluding that Amazon took advantage of a variety of tax breaks and credits to avoid paying federal taxes.  Amazon and the Postal Service  Mr. Trump has also previously criticized the relationship between Amazon and the Postal Service. In December, the president denounced the agency on Twitter for losing billions of dollars when it could be \u201ccharging MUCH MORE\u201d to Amazon and other shippers.  It is true the Postal Service has consistently reported net losses for a decade; the last time it reported net income from its operations was the 2006 fiscal year. In the 2017 fiscal year, the agency reported a net loss of $2.7 billion; the previous three years, it incurred losses of nearly twice that amount.  The beginning of the 2018 fiscal year suggested the organization was not turning its fortunes around. In the first quarter, which included the December holiday season that typically brings its strongest earnings of the year, the Postal Service had a net loss of $540 million.  Those losses cannot be attributed to Amazon shipments alone, however, and the president\u2019s Twitter posts have lacked context. Notably, packages and shipping are areas of growth for the Postal Service that have offset its general shortfalls in revenue.

The Postal Service attributes much of its financial woe to a prolonged decline in the volume of marketing mail and first-class mail \u2014 bills, birthday cards and, for example, bridal shower invitations. Its mail business is still its \u201cmain source of revenue and contribution,\u201d the postmaster general, Megan J. Brennan, said in a statement in February.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  In large part because of the internet \u2014 online bill pay, Facebook birthday posts and e-vites \u2014 the volume of first-class mail being sent through the Postal Service has decreased 43 percent since 2001, when it last peaked.  Still, Mr. Trump\u2019s assertion that the Postal Service is leaving money on the table may have some truth to it. A 2017 analysis by Citigroup concluded that the agency was charging below market rates for package delivery.  If that is the case, Amazon, widely believed to be one of the Postal Service\u2019s biggest customers, certainly benefits.  The report estimated that if the agency increased its parcel rates, Amazon\u2019s shipping costs would rise by about $2.6 billion. Some of that money would presumably go to the Postal Service, which in 2014 handled 40 percent of Amazon\u2019s packages, according to one 2015 estimate.  The report also suggested that Amazon\u2019s high shipment volume gives it a greater opportunity to negotiate rates with shippers. Amazon has acknowledged in the past that it has an arrangement with the Postal Service, but it has rejected the idea that its shipments are being subsidized by the agency.  In a 2017 statement, Amazon said that its partnership with the Postal Service was \u201creviewed annually by the Postal Regulatory Commission,\u201d which found its contracts to be profitable.  The Postal Service\u2019s chief financial officer, Joseph Corbett, has also defended the agency\u2019s shipping rates. In a letter in July to The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Corbett wrote that the Postal Service\u2019s \u201ccompetitive package products, including those that we deliver for Amazon,\u201d are legally required to cover the costs incurred.  Amazon and The Washington Post  People close to Mr. Trump say that his disdain for Amazon (and, by association, for Mr. Bezos) is often set off by his anger at negative articles in The Washington Post. On Friday, the newspaper published a report detailing how Mr. Trump\u2019s legal battles have affected his business empire.

The cancellations signal a recalibration for Amazon, which has taken a middle path in output compared to Netflix \u2014 which plans to flood the market with new shows and movies, estimating to spend between $7 billion and $8 billion on original content in 2018 \u2014 and HBO, which has devoted its resources to a few cultural juggernauts like \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and \u201cWestworld.\u201d  Amazon spent an estimated $4.5 billion in 2017 and tried to reach an array of audiences. \u201cJean-Claude Van Johnson\u201d was an action comedy starring Jean-Claude Van Damme as a washed-up version of himself, while \u201cOne Mississippi,\u201d created by Tig Notaro, and \u201cI Love Dick,\u201d by Jill Soloway and Sarah Gubbins, explored sickness, sexuality and gender roles with a frank honesty.

The studio is not abandoning female-led comedies altogether: \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u201d will move forward after winning best television comedy series at the Golden Globes this month; and the studio just inked a two-year deal with Sharon Horgan, the creator of \u201cCatastrophe.\u201d But the move does indicate a scaling back of smaller projects in favor of landing a mainstream hit.

Back in the United States, Walmart, the world\u2019s largest retailer, is testing out the Bossa Nova robots in dozens of its locations to reduce some tedious tasks that can eat up a worker\u2019s time. The robots, which look like giant wheeled luggage bags, roll up and down the aisles looking for shelves where cereal boxes are out of stock and items like toys are mislabeled. The machines then report back to workers, who restock the shelves and apply new labels.  At 120 of Walmart\u2019s 4,700 American stores, shoppers can also scan items, including fruits and vegetables, using the camera on their smartphones and pay for them using the devices. When customers walk out, an employee checks their receipts and does a \u201cspot check\u201d of the items they bought.  Kroger, one of the country\u2019s largest grocery chains, has also been testing a mobile scanning service in its supermarkets, recently announcing that it would expand it to 400 of its more 2,700 stores.  New start-ups are seeking to give retailers the technology to compete with Amazon\u2019s system. One of them, AiFi, is working on cashierless checkout technology that it says will be flexible and affordable enough that mom-and-pop retailers and bigger outlets can use it. In the United States, venture capitalists put $100 million into retail automation start-ups in each of the past two years, up from about $64 million in 2015, according Pitchbook, a financial data firm.

But Sucharita Kodali, an analyst at Forrester Research, a market research company, said a recent survey of shoppers by her firm had found that a majority of American households with annual income over $100,000 had Prime accounts. The membership rate falls off quickly farther down the income scale, she said.  There are a number of reasons that low-income consumers have been less avid online shoppers, including the fact that many do not have credit cards. Some may not have secure places to receive packages.  \u201cThey are still getting used to the idea of shopping online,\u201d Ms. Kodali said.  Amazon has tried to address some of these obstacles. Amazon Cash, for example, allows people to add money to their Amazon accounts by taking cash to CVS pharmacies, GameStops and other retail locations. Amazon Lockers, installed outside convenience stores and other locations, give people a secure place to pick up and return Amazon packages.

The e-commerce giant has cut the field of candidates to 20 prime locations to complement its Seattle base, including Atlanta, Dallas and New York. Hundreds of cities hoped Amazon would think outside the box, but a desire for talent and a welcoming environment led it to the usual hot spots.  The company, led by Jeff Bezos, started the process in typically innovative fashion in September by issuing an unusual and very public request for proposals. Fully 238 localities in the United States, Canada and Mexico submitted bids, lured by the prospect of $5 billion in investment and a promised 50,000 jobs with compensation averaging over $100,000 each.  Distressed cities like Detroit and Hartford marshaled civic and business leaders to make their cases, seeing the investment as a chance to transform their economic prospects. New Jersey\u2019s former governor Chris Christie dressed up Newark\u2019s bid with $7 billion in potential tax breaks. The contest even prompted the mayor of Stonecrest, an Atlanta suburb, to rename the town Amazon and make Mr. Bezos mayor for life if he chose the town.  With the exception of Newark, most have come away empty-handed. That\u2019s not a surprise given Amazon\u2019s criteria of a large metropolitan area, a strong pool of technical talent, a business-friendly environment and good transportation links. But it\u2019s disappointing that with the exception of a couple of outsiders like Indianapolis and Columbus, Ohio, the company\u2019s finalists \u2014 which also include Austin, Tex., Boston, Los Angeles, Toronto and the suburbs of Washington \u2014 are just about everyone else\u2019s, too.  A conventional choice will no doubt serve Amazon well. Meanwhile, the innovative ideas the bidding process inspired among politicians and business executives around the country might just prompt other companies to think farther outside the box.", "stock": "AMZN", "label": 1, "date": "2018-01-18", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/18/business/dealbook/amazon-hq2-choices-are-disappointingly-undisruptive.html"}, {"article": "Hans Riemer, president of the Montgomery County Council, found out from a friend via text message.  \u201cMy heart skipped a beat,\u201d he said.  The process will now shift into a new phase, with Amazon representatives communicating more directly with the finalist cities as they prepare to select a winner later this year \u2014 and perhaps with cities being even more outspoken about why they should be chosen.

Ms. Bowser said Amazon\u2019s selection of Montgomery County and Northern Virginia \u2014 both near Washington \u2014 spoke to the appeal of the region\u2019s work force.  \u201cOf course,\u201d she added, \u201cwe believe that Washington, D.C. \u2014 with our top talent and world-class amenities \u2014 is the right place for Amazon HQ2.\u201d  Mayor Baraka said that Newark has a \u201cfriendly rivalry\u201d with its bigger neighbor, New York, while adding that his city enjoys the advantages of cheaper real estate, space for development in its downtown and lots of fiber optic network capacity.  Photo  Amazon needs a second headquarters because it\u2019s bursting at the seams in its hometown, Seattle. Mr. Bezos founded the company there in 1994, and it has since transformed the city, employing more than 40,000 there. That expansion has also contributed to Seattle\u2019s soaring cost of living and its traffic woes.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  To lure applicants, Amazon showered local politicians with its own data about the effect the company has had on the Seattle economy, and some of the immediate economic benefits its second home would experience \u2014 including $5 billion in construction spending.  It asked candidates to include in their bids a variety of detailed information, including potential building sites, crime and traffic stats and nearby recreational opportunities. Amazon also asked cities and states to describe the tax incentives available to offset its costs for building and operating its second headquarters. The most eye-popping of those offers was New Jersey\u2019s promise of up to $7 billion in tax incentives to bring Amazon to Newark.  Another tech giant, Apple, this week said it, too, was hunting for a location to build a major new campus. But the company\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, said it would not conduct a public bidding process akin to Amazon\u2019s. He said California and Texas were unlikely locations for the new campus because Apple already has significant operations there.  Amazon\u2019s search process has also attracted critics. Stacy Mitchell, co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a nonprofit organization that serves as an advocate for local businesses, said that politicians were enhancing Amazon\u2019s image just as the company\u2019s market power was under growing scrutiny from groups like her own.  \u201cAs these cities woo and grovel, they are basically communicating this idea that we should want Amazon to be bigger and more powerful in our economy,\u201d Ms. Mitchell said.  Ed Glaeser, a professor of economics at Harvard who studies cities, predicted that the winner of the contest would have in place the kind of positive economic attributes that mean it wouldn\u2019t necessarily need Amazon to thrive.  \u201cAt its best, the competition for Amazon has spurred cities to think about how to improve their quality of life more generally,\u201d he said. \u201cAt its worst, the competition has become a distraction and a contest for throwing cash at the giant.\u201d", "stock": "AMZN", "label": 1, "date": "2018-01-18", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/18/technology/amazon-finalists-headquarters.html"}, {"article": "Luke Schoenfelder, chief executive of Latch, a start-up that makes a family of smart locks, said he believed that Amazon would make a more serious effort to enter the home security market and compete against companies like ADT, Comcast and Alarm.com.

We look forward to being a part of the Amazon team as we work toward our vision for safer neighborhoods.\u201d  Ring\u2019s internet doorbells start at $179. People who want to use them to record video must pay for that capability, with plans starting at $3 a month or $30 a year. The company also makes stand-alone security cameras.  Amazon has taken some baby steps into home security. Last year it began selling an indoor security camera of its own design, Amazon Cloud Cam, and in December it acquired Blink, a maker of inexpensive internet security cameras and doorbells.  A service called Amazon Key uses cameras and internet-connected door locks to allow delivery people to drop orders inside customers\u2019 homes.  Google, one of Amazon\u2019s biggest rivals, is also an increasingly important player in home automation and security, with its Nest thermostats and security cameras.  James McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research, said he believed that Amazon had bought Ring so it could add more intelligent capabilities to its doorbells and cameras, like the ability to use software to recognize faces at the front door.

In a business environment that demands, and rewards, quarterly profits and short-term strategic thinking, Amazon showed extraordinary resolve in focusing on long-term goals, somehow persuading investors to go along.  Over its first decade in existence, including long stretches where it consistently reported losses, Amazon enjoyed a luxury afforded few companies: leeway.  \u201cI think it comes down to a consistent message and consistent strategy, one that doesn\u2019t deviate when the stock goes down or goes up,\u201d said Bill Miller, the chief investment officer at Miller Value Partners, whose largest holding is Amazon.  In part, Amazon has inured itself to pressure from Wall Street by ignoring it. While many chief executives devote significant time to fielding questions from investors, Amazon\u2019s founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos, is famously stingy about the time he spends with major stockholders. He hasn\u2019t appeared on an Amazon earnings calls in years.  In a 2014 interview with Business Insider, Mr. Bezos said he spent a measly six hours a year on investor relations and then only with long-term shareholders, who have been willing to weather the company\u2019s ups and downs. Mr. Miller is one of them.  Mr. Bezos has constantly reminded the market of his philosophy. Each year in the company\u2019s annual letter to shareholders, Amazon attaches a copy of the very first letter from 1997, its first as a publicly traded company.  Photo  \u201cWe will continue to make investment decisions in light of long-term market leadership considerations rather than short-term profitability considerations or short-term Wall Street reactions,\u201d Mr. Bezos wrote in a section of the letter titled, \u201cIt\u2019s All About the Long Term.\u2019\u2019  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Mr. Bezos has been true to his word. Amazon has reported an annual profit in only 13 of the 21 years that it has operated as a publicly traded company, according to FactSet, a financial data firm.  And its profit margins, already low by some measures, have fluctuated from year to year \u2014 hardly moving in the straight upward line that Wall Street usually likes to see.  Yet investors have rewarded Amazon for plowing its profits back into growing its businesses, whether in online retail, cloud computing or, most recently, in grocery stores, with the acquisition of Whole Foods Market.  An Amazon spokesman declined to comment.  It may sound like a Pollyanna view of stock investing, particularly in a market increasingly dominated by trading algorithms and macro bets on the direction of interest rates. But in the case of Amazon, it is actually true.  \u201cIf Wall Street would allow more companies to reinvest like Amazon, it would create great benefits for the economy,\u201d said Henry Blodget, a former stock analyst, who first came to prominence in 1998 by setting a $400 price target for Amazon shares. (He is now editorial director of the online publication Business Insider, in which Mr. Bezos was an investor.)  The reality of the economy, however, is that most other companies are still playing by Wall Street\u2019s old rules, which demand consistent profit growth.

Last month, Kimberly-Clark, under pricing pressure from Amazon and Walmart, said it was laying off more than 5,000 workers and closing or selling 10 of its factories.  It wasn\u2019t always so easy for Amazon. During the tech boom of the late 1990s, Amazon was one of a number of promising tech start-ups that were losing money. But it showed the potential for longer term profit, as it moved from selling books into music and toys.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  But like the rest of the tech sector, Amazon\u2019s shares tumbled in 2000 and 2001 as investors began to wonder if these companies could ever make money. A young debt analyst at Lehman Brothers warned in June 2000 that Amazon might soon run out of cash, causing investors to worry about its survival.  Mr. Bezos had squirreled away enough capital to get through those dark days. But it took many years for investors who had been burned by the dot-com crash to give Amazon a second chance.  For long stretches from 2002 to 2006, Amazon\u2019s stock price languished, while it invested in researching and developing new technologies and businesses.  Photo  Mark Mahaney, a tech analyst at RBC Capital Markets, looked at the company\u2019s slipping profit margins during that period and warned investors to stay away.  Mr. Mahaney said he failed to realize \u201cthat all that spending on R.&D. was a bullish sign for the future.\u201d He has had a buy rating on the company for more than a decade.  Those long-term investments, which Amazon didn\u2019t detail at the time, eventually gave rise to some of the company\u2019s most profitable businesses, like its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services.  The success of the cloud computing business proved a tipping point. If investors allowed Amazon to spend time and money investing, patience would pay off.  Investors are now awaiting the payoff from Amazon\u2019s foray into groceries with its $13 billion acquisition of Whole Foods last spring. How it plans to integrate hundreds of brick and mortar stores with its core e-commerce business is far from clear.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  By now, Wall Street has been well trained to believe that Amazon has a strategy for Whole Foods and it will take time to carry it out.  \u201cWhat the market finally figured out is Amazon is extremely good at investing those dollars,\u201d said Mr. Miller, the investment officer at Miller Value Partners.  Ultimately, much of the investor confidence in Amazon reflects a belief in its future opportunity \u2014 what investors frequently call a company\u2019s \u201caddressable market.\u201d  For Amazon, the addressable market in retail is roughly $5 trillion in the United States and many times that globally, Mr. Miller said. And that\u2019s not even including the traditional information technology market that Amazon Web Services is attacking. \u201cI asked Jeff what the addressable market is for A.W.S.,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cHe just looked at me and said, \u2018Trillions and trillions.\u2019\u201d  Online spending represents less than 10 percent of total retail spending, and Amazon captures almost half of every dollar spent in online shopping by Americans.  Even Mr. Gillespie, the skeptic, acknowledges that Amazon is \u201coperating extremely well.\u201d But he questions whether years of low interest rates have helped inflate Amazon\u2019s value because investors are so starved for return, they are willing to overlook some of the risks.  Those risks, he said, include regulators deciding the company is growing too large or not paying its fair share in taxes.  \u201cPeople tend to assume away these things,\u201d he said.", "stock": "AMZN", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-04", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/04/technology/amazon-asked-for-patience-remarkably-wall-street-complied.html"}, {"article": "Lindsay Walters, a White House spokeswoman, told reporters on Thursday that \u201cthe president has expressed his concerns with Amazon. We have no actions at this time.\u201d  Still, Mr. Trump\u2019s willingness to again single out Amazon and characterize it as a tax cheat and a job killer is a remarkable use of the presidential bully pulpit that could have serious implications for the company even without any formal moves by the federal government.  His comments have already spooked investors, sending Amazon stocks tumbling Wednesday after an article on the website Axios about his anger toward the company. The stock fell further after his tweet on Thursday, though prices rebounded later.  The tech industry is increasingly on the defensive. Facebook is under attack in Washington for its handling of personal data and the social network\u2019s role in the 2016 election. And the recent death of a pedestrian by a self-driving car has renewed criticism of Uber.  \u201cThe general principle that I know deeply concerns the president is that we need to live in a world where the government sets a level playing field between internet vendors and mom and pop stores,\u201d Kevin Hassett, the chair of the president\u2019s council on economic advisers, said Thursday on Fox Business.  Drew Herdener, an Amazon spokesman, declined to comment.  Several current and former officials said that Mr. Trump regularly conflates Amazon with The Post. Mr. Bezos owns the paper privately, separate from his role at Amazon.  Brad Parscale, the president\u2019s 2020 campaign manager, on Thursday channeled Mr. Trump\u2019s anger about The Post in a tweet of his own, saying: \u201cDo not forget to mention that @amazon has probably 10x the data on every American that @facebook does. All that data and own a political newspaper, The @washingtonpost. Hmm\u2026\u201d  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  And far-right, conspiracy-fanning websites \u2014 some of which Mr. Trump is known to read \u2014 have for months stoked the idea that The Post is in cahoots with the C.I.A. because the agency contracts with Amazon to provide cloud-based data storage. Last November, a headline at one of those sites, Infowars, said: \u201cBEZOS & DEEP STATE UNITE: AMAZON LAUNCHES CLOUD SERVICE FOR CIA.\u201d  The Post declined to comment.  One person close to Mr. Trump, who asked for anonymity to discuss private discussions in the Oval Office, said that the president mused about the issue of Amazon and taxes at least a half-dozen times in the last six months. The president has repeatedly claimed that Amazon costs the Postal Service money even though officials have explained to him that is not the case. Amazon has said that the Postal Regulatory Commission, which oversees the service, has consistently found that its contracts with Amazon are profitable.  People close to Mr. Trump say the president is convinced that Amazon unfairly benefits from tax laws. The internet giant collects sales taxes on its own products in all 45 states that have one, but third-party vendors who sell products on the site often do not collect sales tax, a fact that rivals say is unfair. In addition, some municipalities complain that the company does not collect local taxes.  In April, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in an case on whether to allow states to impose sales taxes on all internet sales. Many observers believe the justices are poised to reverse its 1992 ruling that exempted online retailers with no physical presence in a state.

Mr. Trump hears the sales tax complaints frequently during visits with his wealthy friends at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, and in meetings at the White House, several aides and associates said. One person familiar with his thinking said that the president believes many of his core supporters are hurt when Amazon disrupts the local businesses where they live.  The president\u2019s critique is shared by some of his usual adversaries in the Democratic Party. Like many of Mr. Trump\u2019s wealthy Republican friends, Representative Keith Ellison, Democrat of Minnesota, has been critical of Amazon\u2019s growing power in the marketplace.  \u201cThe Trump administration should rein in giants like Amazon because they have an unfair stranglehold on the competition, not because the president has a personal feud with a company\u2019s C.E.O.,\u201d Mr. Ellison said in a statement on Thursday.  There was also some irony in the criticism coming from Mr. Trump, who has boasted about his dexterity in avoiding paying taxes. \u201cThis is the guy who said that not paying taxes \u2018makes me smart,\u2019\u201d said Matt Gardner, senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a nonpartisan research organization.  How the president could slow Amazon, beyond take to Twitter or complain about the company in speeches, is unclear.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  If Mr. Trump were to pressure the Justice Department to pursue antitrust enforcement action against Amazon, it would be a sharp break from tradition, experts say, because the White House has kept a far distance from those cases for decades.  \u201cIt would be a gross violation and abuse of our due process,\u201d said Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute.  But the president has repeatedly crossed lines that his predecessors have observed. In the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, he has pressured Justice Department officials to investigate his Democratic rivals and to abandon the investigation of himself and his associates.  AT&T and Time Warner have suggested Mr. Trump played a role in the Justice Department\u2019s decision to block the companies\u2019 $85.4 billion media merger. Makan Delrahim, the head of antitrust at the Justice Department, has said under oath in Congress that he would not allow the White House to impact his decisions over that merger or any other cases.  Mr. Trump also surprised antitrust experts with his swift decision to block Broadcom\u2019s merger with Qualcomm earlier this month, after a review by a government panel on foreign investments. The president has direct authority to block a merger with foreign companies that pose national security concerns.  Amazon has tried, through lobbyists and outside consultants, to meet with administration officials and members of Congress to counter arguments about the company\u2019s tax collection and its relationship with the Postal Service.  The size of company\u2019s lobbying staff has ballooned in recent years, according to public filings, focusing largely on drones, transportation, taxes and cybersecurity. It has hired antitrust consultants over the past year.  In 2015, shortly after Mr. Trump started his attacks against the company, Mr. Bezos joked on Twitter about sending the candidate into space on a rocket made by Blue Origin, a space exploration start-up Mr. Bezos owns.  But when Mr. Trump became the Republican nominee and then president, Mr. Bezos and Amazon stopped responding to his attacks, seeing little upside in a public quarrel with him, according to two people briefed on the decision. The people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the conversations were private, said that these days, Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets were more likely to prompt eye-rolling inside the company than any serious effort at crisis control.", "stock": "AMZN", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-29", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/29/us/politics/trump-amazon-taxes.html"}, {"article": "1 block = $500 million in estimated world-wide 2017 ad revenue $5.3 billion Oath  $40 billion  Facebook  $0.8 billion  Snap  $73 billion  Google  $2.8 billion  Amazon  $2 billion  Twitter  1 block = $500 million in estimated world-wide 2017 ad revenue $40 billion  $73 billion  Google  Facebook  $0.8 billion  Snap  $5.3 billion  Oath  $2.8 billion  Amazon  $2  billion  Twitter  What happens when and if Amazon is not only the biggest online retailer in the U.S., but also one of the biggest physical retailers, with total sales greater than those of Walmart and all the data and technical chops of a Facebook or Google?  How it works  Thousands of brands large and small, selling through Amazon\u2019s Marketplace seller program, are now what drives Amazon\u2019s rapid growth in ad revenue. Jijamas, founded in 2013, wouldn\u2019t exist without Amazon, says Gustavo Sanchez, the brand\u2019s co-founder and chief executive. Jijamas sells one thing: Supersoft, high-end women\u2019s pajamas.  Starting at about $70 a set, they rarely turn up near the top of search results for \u201cpajamas\u201d on Amazon, says Mr. Sanchez, since the site\u2019s algorithm favors cheaper, higher-volume goods. Even its high customer ratings only help Jijamas get so far.  The company\u2019s revenue growth is dependent on Amazon advertising, Mr. Sanchez says.  Advertising on Amazon is much like advertising on Google\u2019s AdWords platform, says Daniel Knijnik, chief executive of Quartile, a small ad agency started last August that focuses solely on Amazon. Most ads appear atop search results for various keywords.  Jijamas, a specialty line of high-end pajamas, depends on Amazon for virtually all its revenue growth. Shown, Gustavo Sanchez, the brand\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, on January 26 in New York City. Photo: Kenneth Bachor/The Wall Street Journal  Advertising plays an important role in Amazon\u2019s lucrative direct-to-consumer marketplace, where Amazon, at added cost, provides warehousing and shipping to third-party sellers. Because advertising allows brands to connect better with Amazon\u2019s shoppers, Mr. Knijnik says, even manufacturers who previously sold wholesale to Amazon are now opening their own \u201cstores\u201d on the site.  For sellers like Mr. Sanchez, advertising on Amazon is a mixed bag. A \u201csponsored\u201d listing is essential for getting products to the top of search results, which is the only surefire way to sell anything on a site that offers millions of different products. But sponsored lists are also another way Amazon skims off his profits.  Amazon wants to deliver everything you want to your doorstep, anywhere in the world. But the e-commerce giant faces several challenges in its pursuit of a global empire. WSJ's Karan Deep Singh breaks down the basics with the help of an Amazon delivery box.  On top of the 15% of an item\u2019s selling price that Mr. Sanchez pays just to list Jijamas on Amazon\u2019s marketplace, and the 5% to 6% he pays to have Amazon warehouse and ship his products, there is now up to 12% going to advertising for every item sold through an ad. This April, Amazon will start charging an additional 2% to list apparel (it hasn\u2019t disclosed why). The net result is that Amazon will take about 35% of the price of each pair of Jijamas sold through its sponsored listings.  If Amazon decides to change its search result ranking algorithms or hike its ad fees, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing I can do about it,\u201d Mr. Sanchez says. Amazon represents 65% of his total sales, he adds; the remainder comes from his own website.  Where it can grow  Amazon is continually building and buying new sources of data on our tastes and consumer behavior, from its acquisition of Whole Foods and the build-out of its cashierless Amazon Go stores to the invasion of its low-cost, voice-powered speakers and the rapid increase in its library of streaming video.  Every time Amazon racks up another percentage point of the $5 trillion U.S. retail pie, another $50 billion in the kind of data that Google and Facebook relied on disappears from their systems. Plus, Amazon understands shoppers in a way Google and Facebook might not.  \u201cAmazon doesn\u2019t just know what you buy, they also know about how you shop,\u201d says Diana Gordon, director of Shop+, the ecommerce-focused arm of WPP-owned ad firm Mindshare. \u201cThey know your browsing behavior, the cadence with which you restock certain types of consumables,\u201d she adds.  Amazon is building out not only its self-service ad business but also the sales team devoted to getting brands on board.  All of this could give Amazon an edge over Google and Facebook, but for it to scale that business, it will have to look beyond ads targeted at consumers who are already shopping on its sites.  For that, Amazon has a web-spanning advertising network just like Google\u2019s and Facebook\u2019s\u2014which is the reason a vacuum cleaner you once almost bought can haunt you for weeks on random websites. The Amazon Advertising Platform lets advertisers manage ad buys across multiple advertising exchanges, and it has quietly become as familiar to marketers as its equivalent from Google-owned DoubleClick.

AMZN -1.22% has tapped NBC Entertainment President Jennifer Salke to head Amazon Studios, its movie and television unit, succeeding Roy Price, who resigned amid allegations that he engaged in sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior toward a producer.  At Amazon, Ms. Salke, 53 years old, will oversee a deep-pocketed and ambitious online video service with an annual budget of more than $4.5 billion, according to people at the company.  Its best-known television series include \u201cTransparent,\u201d \u201cThe Tick\u201d and \u201cBosch.\u201d Its most successful films have been \u201cThe Big Sick\u201d and Oscar winner \u201cManchester by the Sea.\u201d However Amazon has struggled to find broadly popular hits like HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and Netflix Inc.\u2019s \u201cStranger Things.\u201d  Among the challenges facing Ms. Salke will be improving relations with the creative community, some of whom criticized the way Amazon operated during Mr. Price\u2019s seven-year tenure. Several producers expressed frustration at what they called creative interference by Amazon executives, often leading to production delays and greater expenses. David E. Kelley, who created the legal drama \u201cGoliath\u201d for Amazon, told The Wall Street Journal last fall that the company is \u201cin way over their heads.\u201d  \u201cWhat stood out about Jen was the deep relationships she has nurtured with creators and talent over her career,\u201d Jeffrey Blackburn, the Seattle-based Amazon executive to whom Ms. Salke will report, said in a statement. \u201cShe\u2019s built an impeccable reputation as a big leader who emphasizes creativity, collaboration, and teamwork.\u201d  Since Mr. Price left in October, Amazon Studios has been overseen by Chief Operating Officer Albert Cheng, whose background is primarily in technology and digital media.

WSJ's Karan Deep Singh breaks down the basics with the help of an Amazon delivery box.  Shortly after Mr. Price stepped down, his lawyer, Eric George, said the executive had never been accused of sexual harassment \u201cwith the sole exception of the incident alleged by [the producer], the portrayal of which he vigorously contests.\u201d  The hiring of Ms. Salke, who has run NBC\u2019s prime-time entertainment since 2011, comes after a very public and drawn-out search for Mr. Price\u2019s successor. A leading candidate, Fox Television Group Chairman and Chief Executive Dana Walden, took herself out of consideration early on; another candidate\u2014A&E Networks Group Chief Executive Nancy Dubuc\u2014was also in the running. Fox\u2019s parent, 21st Century Fox Inc., shares common ownership with News Corp., which owns The Wall Street Journal.  In a statement, Ms. Salke said Amazon has \u201cinnovated, disrupted, and created characters that are already an indelible part of pop-culture.\u201d  One of Ms. Salke\u2019s biggest tasks will be overseeing Amazon\u2019s production of \u201cLord of the Rings,\u201d an ambitious and expensive series based on J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s popular fantasy novels. Amazon won a bidding war for the rights to the series, which was given a multi-season commitment.  Ms. Salke has a solid track record as a television development executive. Shows developed on her watch at NBC include the drama \u201cThis Is Us\u201d and the comedy \u201cThe Good Place.\u201d She also oversees Universal Television, the production studio at NBCUniversal which produces shows for NBC and other networks and services. NBCUniversal is a unit of Comcast Corp.  However, Ms. Salke has no experience running a world-wide digital business or in movies, both of which she will oversee in her new post. Amazon is taking a bet that she can successfully handle those new responsibilities.  Prior to joining NBC, Ms. Salke was a television-studio executive at 21st Century Fox. She started her career at Aaron Spelling Productions.  No successor for Ms. Salke was named by NBC Entertainment Chairman Robert Greenblatt. Other senior entertainment executives who will likely be under consideration include Pearlena Igbokwe, who is president of Universal Television, and NBC programming executives Bruce Evans and Lisa Katz.

With a foray into financial services, Amazon would have a chance to become an even bigger part of Americans\u2019 lives. Photo: lindsey wasson/Reuters  Amazon.com Inc. AMZN -1.22% is in talks with big banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. about building a checking-account-like product the online retailer could offer its customers, according to people familiar with the matter.  The effort is still in its early stages and may not come to fruition, the people said. The talks with financial firms are focused on creating a product that would appeal to younger customers and those without bank accounts. Whatever its final form, the initiative wouldn\u2019t involve Amazon becoming a bank, the people said.  If the product emerges, it would further inject Amazon into the lives of those who shop on its website and at its Whole Foods grocery stores, read on its Kindles, watch its streaming video and chat with Alexa, its digital assistant. Offering a product that is similar to an own-branded bank account could help reduce fees Amazon pays to financial firms and provide it with valuable data on customers\u2019 income and spending habits.  The company\u2019s latest push also answers a question that bank executives have been asking with increasing worry: When will Amazon show up on their turf?  With millions of customers, troves of data, access to cheap capital and seemingly unlimited leeway from its investors to enter new businesses, Amazon is a fearsome competitor. Its more-than $700 billion market value eclipses the combined value of JPMorgan and Bank of America Corp , the two biggest U.S. banks.  Already, Amazon is building a delivery service that one day could compete with United Parcel Service Inc. and FedEx Corp. , targeting the hospital-supplies market and considering a push into prescription drugs. Shares of companies in those industries have fallen sharply on news of Amazon\u2019s entry.  In banking, however, Amazon appears to be arriving more as a partner than a disrupter.  Last fall, it put out a request for proposals from several banks for a hybrid-type checking account and is weighing pitches from firms including JPMorgan and Capital One Financial Corp. , some of the people said. It is too early to say exactly what the product will look like, including whether it would give customers the ability to write checks, directly pay bills, or access to a nationwide ATM network.  Amazon\u2019s collaborative approach supports what bank executives have long said: that new regulations put in place after the financial crisis, while bad for profitability, are a protective moat against challengers.  Related Video Amazon wants to deliver everything you want to your doorstep, anywhere in the world. But the e-commerce giant faces several challenges in its pursuit of a global empire. WSJ's Karan Deep Singh breaks down the basics with the help of an Amazon delivery box.  Any move by Amazon to start its own banking arm would subject it to capital rules and other regulations that likely would limit its aggressive expansion. And there would likely be stiff opposition. An effort by Walmart Inc. more than a decade ago to obtain a type of banking license withered after intense criticism from a range of companies and lawmakers.  For JPMorgan or Capital One, winning the assignment would be a chance to keep a potential competitor close and strengthen ties to a company that is popular among millennials, whose financial habits are changing quickly. In a recent poll of 1,000 Amazon customers conducted by LendEDU, an online student-loan marketplace, 38% said they would trust Amazon to handle their finances equally as they would a traditional bank.  JPMorgan is already close to Amazon. It has issued Amazon-branded credit cards since 2002, and the two companies are teaming up along with Berkshire Hathaway Inc. on an initiative to tackle rising health-care costs for their employees.  Amazon, led by CEO Jeff Bezos, last fall put out a request for proposals from several banks for a hybrid-type checking account. Photo: Mike Kane/Bloomberg News  JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer James Dimon has said he nearly joined Amazon as an executive in the 1990s. He remains an admirer of the company\u2019s CEO, Jeff Bezos, whom he called a \u201cfriend of the family\u201d at an investor presentation last week.  Capital One, meanwhile, is one of the largest bank users of Amazon\u2019s cloud-computing business.  Amazon has been considering a bigger push into finance for years, looking to reduce the fees it pays banks and payments processors, people familiar with the matter said. Providing Amazon customers with a checking account from which they could directly withdraw cash for purchases could help to reduce some of those fees. But there isn\u2019t much precedent for this type of arrangement. It is much more complicated than, say, a co-branded credit card.  Converting its shoppers into financial account holders could also aid Amazon as it ramps up its efforts in payments, a fragmented segment with no clear winner yet. The company has had limited success in getting its own system, Amazon Pay, accepted at other online merchants.  The company is now trying to bring Amazon Pay to brick-and-mortar stores, according to people familiar with those plans. It is likely to begin with Whole Foods, which Amazon bought last year for roughly $13.5 billion, the people said.  Not yet clear: what Amazon can offer merchants, which already face a number of payment providers jockeying for space at the checkout counter. But shoppers who have an everyday banking relationship with Amazon might be more likely to use Amazon Pay.  Amazon isn\u2019t the first retailer to make a play in financial services. In the early 1980s, Sears Holding Corp. bought brokerage Dean Witter. Critics dubbed the offering \u201csocks and stocks.\u201d Sears divested Dean Witter in the early 1990s.  \u2014AnnaMaria Andriotis  contributed to this article.

Airbnb said in a statement that it selected Mr. Greeley, who will start March 18, due to his operational experience and customer focus. Donna Boyer, director of product for the Homes unit, left the company in January and Airbnb has seen other high profile departures, including its CFO Laurence Tosi, who stepped down last month.  The Homes unit\u2014which includes the apartment and whole-home rentals for which Airbnb is known\u2014represents nearly all of the San Francisco startup\u2019s $2.57 billion in 2017 revenue.  Last month Airbnb announced a series of sweeping changes to Homes, adding options like hotels, a higher-end tier of homes called Plus, and a loyalty program.  The company is grappling with limited inventory in some of its most popular destinations as well as customer complaints of inconsistent home quality. It also has addressed renters\u2019 claims that hosts had discriminated against them. The company implemented changes in late 2016 to ensure hosts couldn\u2019t discriminate.

Officials from the Fair Trade Commission, Japan\u2019s antitrust watchdog, have visited the headquarters of Amazon Japan to see if any violations of the Antimonopoly Act have taken place, a government official said Thursday.  Amazon is fully cooperating with the commission, an Amazon Japan spokeswoman said, without elaborating.  The official declined to specify why the government was investigating Amazon. But he said that in general, the commission was concerned about cases in which sellers of goods may face harm from spurning the demands of powerful retailers.  The commission was interested in ways powerful online retailers can distort competition, reduce incentives to cut prices elsewhere and gain an advantage over other online shopping mall operators, he added.  Japan accounted for $11.9 billion, or nearly 7%, of Amazon\u2019s $178 billion in global sales in 2017. That made it the third-biggest market for the company after the U.S. and Germany.

As in the U.S., the company\u2019s rapid growth and aggressive pricing has generated wide ripple effects across the Japanese retail industry\u2014to the extent that the Bank of Japan has cited low e-commerce prices as one reason for the nation\u2019s sluggish inflation.  Amazon commanded the biggest portion of Japan\u2019s e-commerce market in 2016, at more than 20%, according to a survey by the Japan External Trade Organization. That scale makes it hard for sellers\u2014already fighting for customers as the population shrinks\u2014to refuse requests from Amazon, government officials have said.  The Japan Fair Trade Commission closed a previous probe of Amazon Japan just nine months ago. The commission said it found Amazon Japan had demanded that suppliers offer Amazon customers prices equal to or less than their prices on other online shopping sites such as those run by Rakuten Inc. or Yahoo Japan Corp.  The commission said the practice could give Amazon Japan the broadest lineup of goods at the lowest prices and hinder competition.  Amazon Japan said at the time that it promised Japanese regulators to stop requiring sellers to match the price offered on other sites. The commission closed its probe in exchange.

Amazon is adding Whole Foods to its one- and two-hour delivery option, Prime Now, in four markets. Photo: Elaine Thompson/Associated Press  Amazon.com Inc. AMZN -1.22% said it would start delivering Whole Foods groceries via its fastest delivery option in four markets, marking the first major integration between its e-commerce operations and its new brick-and-mortar grocery chain.  The online retail giant will add Whole Foods to its one- and two-hour delivery option, Prime Now, in the grocer\u2019s hometown of Austin, Texas, as well as Dallas, Virginia Beach, Va. and Cincinnati, Ohio.  Stephenie Landry, the Amazon vice president who oversees Prime Now, said it plans to expand the effort, but declined to say how quickly. She noted that Prime Now grew to more than 50 global markets in less than three years following its creation.  Amazon\u2019s latest move is one of the first to potentially take aim at major grocers racing to offer deliveries and pickups to better compete with Amazon, along with rival online delivery services like Instacart Inc., which currently delivers from Whole Foods. Grocer stocks were hit hard by the news of Amazon\u2019s decision to purchase Whole Foods last summer, with six major food retailers losing roughly $12 billion in value after the deal\u2019s announcement.  Still, Amazon has struggled in recent years to make its grocery delivery business work. Its grocery delivery arm AmazonFresh was scaled back late last year, ending service in some ZIP Codes. The company\u2019s acquisition of Whole Foods was viewed by some analysts as a way to help address some of those challenges.  Analysts have largely expected Amazon to start offering Whole Foods deliveries since the roughly $13.5 billion deal was announced. Already Amazon pairs with grocer Sprouts Farmers Market Inc. and other outside retailers and restaurants in some markets to offer speedy deliveries.

WSJ's Karan Deep Singh breaks down the basics with the help of an Amazon delivery box.  Ms. Landry said those partnerships will continue.  For the new Prime Now deliveries, employees will pick the orders in store from the shelves as they come in. Customers will be able to select from a variety of fresh produce and proteins, and some in-store items won\u2019t be available. Prices may also differ.  Prime Now is available only to the company\u2019s Prime members, who typically pay $99 annually. Two-hour deliveries are free on orders over $35, but tips are suggested for drivers. One-hour delivery costs $7.99.  Amazon has previously lowered prices at Whole Foods and started offering some of the grocer\u2019s private label brands on its website and via Prime Now. It also plans to introduce benefits for members of its Prime program.  Ms. Landry said that Whole Foods and Amazon have been partnering on the Prime Now initiative, allowing Amazon to take advantage of the grocers\u2019 marketing expertise and in-store operations.  \u201cYou\u2019re going to continue to see us doing lots of things together,\u201d she added.  \u2014Heather Haddon contributed to this article  Write to Laura Stevens at laura.stevens@wsj.com", "stock": "AMZN", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-08", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-to-deliver-whole-foods-groceries-1518066000"}, {"article": "Amazon.com Inc. AMZN -1.22% is scheduled to announce its fourth-quarter earnings after the market closes Thursday. Here\u2019s what you need to know:  EARNINGS FORECAST: Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Amazon to earn $1.85 a share, compared with $1.54 a year ago. The company has forecast an operating income range between $300 million and $1.65 billion, compared with income of $1.26 billion a year ago.  REVENUE FORECAST: Quarterly revenue of $59.83 billion is forecast by the analysts, compared with $43.74 billion a year ago. Amazon said it expected sales of between $56 billion and $60.5 billion for the quarter, which includes growth from its acquisition of Whole Foods.  WHAT TO WATCH:  \u2014HOLIDAYS: Amazon lately has been demonstrating a little more fiscal discipline, something that may pay off with record profitability in its all-important fourth quarter. Already, industry numbers are indicating a positive holiday season for retailers as consumers spent more, something that should benefit Amazon, which has a 40%-plus share of online shopping.  \u2014WHOLE FOODS: Amazon acquired Whole Foods in August, and the fourth quarter is the first full quarter of reporting. Amazon has so far added lockers for package pickups and lowered prices. Analysts will expect some evidence of whether it is paying off. For roughly one month in the third quarter, the grocery chain contributed about $1.28 billion in sales and $21 million in operating income.  \u2014HQ2: Executives may provide an update on its search for a second headquarters. The company earlier this month narrowed its list to 20 from 238. The stakes are high: Amazon has said it plans to create about 50,000 jobs and invest $5 billion over nearly 20 years.  \u2014HEALTH CARE: Amazon on Tuesday said it was joining JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. to form a new company focusing on lowering U.S. health-care costs. The companies hope the entire health-care project could at a minimum save them hundreds of millions of dollars, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Amazon in January told the Boston-based mutual fund that food waste wasn\u2019t material and that the e-commerce giant was already working to reduce it. Amazon said food represented less than 1% of operating expenses and assets last year, allowing it to exclude the proposal under SEC rules.  Grocers, restaurants and food-service companies waste food worth $55 billion a year, according to ReFED, a nonprofit working on food-waste reduction. Food retailers are responsible for food waste worth some $18 billion a year, roughly double the sector\u2019s profit from food sales.  More investors are pushing companies to change food-waste and packaging practices that they see as a potential drag on profits in a low-margin business. Many companies are responding.

The indefatigable CEO stopped appearing personally on Amazon\u2019s quarterly earnings calls years ago, but he had a clear message for investors Thursday when the online retail giant posted record earnings along with a 38% jump in sales for the fourth quarter. Writing of the strong success of his company\u2019s voice-activated digital assistant technology called Alexa, Mr. Bezos noted in the company\u2019s release: \u201cWe don\u2019t see positive surprises of this magnitude very often\u2014expect us to double down.\u201d  It is unlikely that he means just more speakers. Amazon has long been sharply focused on driving growth with little urgency to boost profits. It has been richly rewarded by investors for doing so. Amazon\u2019s market value soared 56% last year, beating all of its Big Tech peers despite their much fatter bottom lines. For example, Facebook generated about 50 cents in operating earnings for every dollar of revenue in 2017; Amazon generated 2.3 cents by the same measure.  It is worth noting that Mr. Bezos\u2019s biggest gambles actually take a while to pay off. It was 13 years ago today that he first announced Amazon Prime, a membership-based shipping service. At the time, it seemed improbable that many people would pay $79 a year to get \u201cHarry Potter\u201d books rushed to their doorstep. But Prime has since become a must-have for more than 90 million members in the U.S. alone, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. It now generates more than $9 billion in subscription fee revenue per year for Amazon and effectively locks in Amazon as the first choice in shopping destinations for its paying members.  It isn\u2019t cheap to maintain, though. Amazon has since sweetened Prime with services like video and music on demand, putting the company into the business of creating new content to keep attracting users.  There seems to be no limit to where Amazon will eventually spread. The company became a major grocer last year with its acquisition of Whole Foods Market and even has been making rumblings about getting into health care of late. The company even noted the contribution of revenue from its budding advertising business on Thursday.  Mr. Bezos\u2019s ambitions have helped make Amazon the world\u2019s fourth most valuable company and himself the world\u2019s wealthiest person.

More than a dozen executives and senior managers have left since Amazon acquired Whole Foods last year, according to former employees and recruiters steering them to new jobs. People who have left include leaders of the bakery, produce, sustainability and local-foods divisions.  Some veterans have left even though higher-ups asked them to stay. Others say they were pushed out after the deal was announced but before it closed, as Whole Foods sought to tighten command.  Executives from Amazon and Whole Foods said that the two companies share a customer focus, are fitting together well and have made great strides in the merger in a short time. But the exodus has raised concerns among employees and suppliers that the distinctive approach that made Whole Foods a natural and organic powerhouse won\u2019t endure under Amazon\u2019s ownership.  \u201cCulturally it\u2019s been a rough start,\u201d said a procurement veteran who left Whole Foods earlier this year after nearly a decade.  Some of the grocer\u2019s top managers have bristled at reporting to younger Amazon executives, people who work with them say. Other employees say Amazon hasn\u2019t explained the specifics of its plans to integrate the grocer into its business.  Amazon wants to deliver everything you want to your doorstep, anywhere in the world. But the e-commerce giant faces several challenges in its pursuit of a global empire. WSJ's Karan Deep Singh breaks down the basics with the help of an Amazon delivery box.  Whole Foods chief executive and co-founder John Mackey and Steve Kessel, an Amazon senior vice president who oversees the grocer, said in separate statements that Whole Foods has thrived in the seven months since the e-commerce giant bought it for roughly $13.5 billion.  \u201cWe...have maintained our distinctive culture while embracing many of Amazon\u2019s leadership principles,\u201d Mr. Mackey said.  \u201cWe are off to a great start, and look forward to many years of future success together,\u201d Mr. Kessel said.  Executive departures are common after mergers. Amazon and Whole Foods have held town halls for store employees to discuss their concerns.  This week, executives invited top suppliers to Whole Foods\u2019 Austin headquarters to discuss their frustration with operational changes, including fee increases that predate the merger. Some suppliers said the additional cost could force them to raise prices or defect to other retailers.  The fee increases are overdue and the changes are providing more consistency for suppliers, a spokeswoman said. Whole Foods leaders at the meeting discussed new merchandising opportunities and growth plans with roughly 200 suppliers, she said.  Some Whole Foods executives are urging their colleagues to be patient. They say Amazon can help the grocer make technology improvements, and new ownership has relieved the company of shareholder pressure to reverse falling sales. Some Whole Foods department managers described Amazon executives as respectful and eager to learn from the grocer\u2019s decades of experience sourcing food and handling produce.  Some Whole Foods employees want Amazon executives to tackle the grocer\u2019s problems more aggressively. Already, Amazon executives have questioned an inventory-management system that has left many Whole Foods stores short of some products, according to a person familiar with the discussions.  But other Whole Foods veterans have been frustrated by what they see as Amazon\u2019s insular culture and penchant for secrecy, according to current and former employees. \u201cThere really hasn\u2019t been very much communication,\u201d one former executive said.  Some cited the two organizations\u2019 fundamental differences on issues such as promoting and grooming talent, and whether to focus more on needs of customers or employees. They have noted pressure to put on a good face for Amazon executives, including among the rank and file during town hall meetings.  Some suppliers said new hires at Whole Foods have been slow to master the chain\u2019s techniques for sourcing and marketing healthful foods. Many executives who have left, meanwhile, are consulting for other natural-food companies and interviewing with other retailers, taking that knowledge to competitors.  \u201cIt makes it really difficult when you lose the institutional knowledge,\u201d said Bill Caskey, co-founder of the food consultancy Pentallect Inc.  John Mackey, the founder and CEO of Whole Foods, in a Chicago store in 2017. \u2018We...have maintained our distinctive culture while embracing many of Amazon\u2019s leadership principles,\u2019 Mr. Mackey says.

Sales have grown, with Whole Foods\u2019 main distributor, United Natural Foods Inc., reporting a 19% year-over-year jump in business to the chain last quarter.  Surveys by research firm Field Agent show that some shoppers appreciate the lower prices and are shopping at Whole Foods more often. Others worry the chain\u2019s standards have slipped.  \u201cThere\u2019s a difference in the way that things look,\u201d said Melanie Haas, a retiree who recently stopped shopping at a Whole Foods in Charlottesville, Va. \u201cThere\u2019s not as much available.\u201d  Write to Heather Haddon at heather.haddon@wsj.com and Laura Stevens at laura.stevens@wsj.com", "stock": "AMZN", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-22", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/whole-foods-is-losing-executives-under-new-owner-amazon-1521711002"}, {"article": "The Amazon logo is seen at the Young Entrepreneurs fair in Paris, France, February 7, 2018.

Amazon.com Inc. AMZN -1.22% has accounted for 27% of the broader index\u2019s 1.6% gain through Tuesday, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices\u2019 data. That is followed by Microsoft Corp. MSFT -0.53% , which has contributed 13%, and Netflix Inc. at 8.3%. U.S. stocks fell Wednesday, but Amazon and Netflix extended their 2018 gains, adding to their dominance over the S&P 500.  \u201cWhen you see a Netflix or Amazon leading, it\u2019s not necessarily a great sign of investor confidence, since you know those names can always deliver growth no matter what\u2019s going on,\u201d said Jack Ablin, founding partner and chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors.  Investors have fretted in recent years about the dominance of a single sector or stock in the market, but those fears have generally proved unfounded. Markets continued marching higher even after shares of Apple Inc., which was a driver of the rally, stalled for part of 2016.  The S&P 500 technology sector has driven more than three quarters of the index\u2019s gains, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. The next biggest contributor is the consumer-discretionary sector\u2014which includes tech-focused Amazon and Netflix\u2014with more than a third of the advance.  To some investors, the continued outperformance of technology-oriented companies is surprising. After the tech sector jumped 37% in 2017, nearly doubling the broader S&P 500\u2019s advance, many investors expected the rally to stall or be overtaken by other sectors.  Among those expected to gain were cyclical stocks like commodity producers, manufacturers and banks whose businesses tend to improve as the economy strengthens and prices rise.  Instead, energy shares have extended their rout, even as U.S. crude prices have bounced off their 2014 lows. Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. have together chipped away about 12% from the S&P 500\u2019s year-to-date advance. And industrial firms, which soared after the 2016 presidential election on bets that the Trump administration would pump up infrastructure spending, have lagged behind the S&P 500, as some investors have questioned how the administration will secure funding for its plan.  Other investors predicted bank shares would begin outperforming the broader market again after the passage of the Republican tax overhaul. And those companies have seen a boost: JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp. together have made up 12% of the S&P 500\u2019s 2018 gains, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.  Yet enthusiasm for technology stocks hasn\u2019t tapered off. Roughly a third of global fund managers say they are overweight technology stocks in their portfolios, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey conducted at the start of the month. That was the highest share of overweights of all 11 S&P 500 sectors.  Tech\u2019s dominance has helped the Nasdaq Composite, which heavily weights shares of technology companies, outperform other indexes so far this year.

Pedestrians walked past an Amazon Go store in Seattle in April 2017. The cashierless convenience store, which had been open only to employees for testing purposes, is scheduled to open to the public on Monday after a yearlong delay. Photo: Elaine Thompson/Associated Press  Nearly a year after it was promised, Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s AMZN -1.22% cashierless convenience store is slated to open to the public on Monday.  The new Amazon Go store, located in the base of Amazon\u2019s main headquarters in Seattle, uses computer vision and machine-learning algorithms to track shoppers and charge them for what they select, thereby eliminating checkout counters.  In an interview last week, Dilip Kumar, vice president of technology for Amazon Go and Amazon Books, said testing with employees has trained the technology to work in the store, an experiment that is part of the company\u2019s broader effort to reinvent how consumers shop.  Mr. Kumar declined to say whether Amazon will expand the Go concept, although he said the company has developed the technology to scale.  From the Archives Amazon unveiled its first small-format grocery store, Amazon Go, on Monday. It\u2019s one of at least three formats of brick-and-mortar food stores the online retail giant is exploring. Photo: Amazon.com Inc. (Originally published Dec. 5, 2016)  Amazon announced the new Go store with fanfare in December 2016, and said it would open to the public in early 2017. The opening was delayed, however, as the technology proved more difficult to master than expected, with glitches occurring when too many people were in the store or were moving too quickly, The Wall Street Journal reported in March 2017.  Amazon didn\u2019t explain the delay at the time. According to Mr. Kumar, while the store was originally expected to quickly open to the public to gain extra traffic needed for testing, the company decided it had enough employees to teach the system instead.  That training helped Amazon Go\u2019s technology better identify objects and follow the different speeds and patterns of shoppers, tasks Mr. Kumar described as particularly challenging in a crowd.  Some people \u201cmove in very unpredictable ways,\u201d Mr. Kumar said. \u201cYou\u2019re always bending down, you\u2019re examining items, you\u2019re picking things up.\u201d  The Go experiment shows how Amazon is trying to transform shopping in physical stores after decades of pioneering retail online. Since 2015, the company also has added more than a dozen Amazon Books stores, which encourage customers to pull out their phones to scan covers for prices.  In August, Amazon completed a $13.5 billion deal to buy grocery chain Whole Foods, adding 470 brick-and-mortar stores to its portfolio overnight.  Amazon Go\u2019s technology uses cameras throughout the store to track shoppers once they are inside, though it doesn\u2019t use facial recognition, Mr. Kumar said. A customer entering the store scans his or her phone and then becomes represented internally as a 3-D object to the system. Cameras also are pointed at the shelves to determine interactions with goods.  Shoppers browse the items at the Amazon Go store in Seattle during its employee-only testing phase. The store uses computer vision and machine-learning algorithms to track shoppers. Photo: Elaine Thompson/Associated Press  Among the challenges for the technology was telling the difference between similar looking products\u2014say containers of vanilla and regular yogurt. Adding to the complexity, when customers pick up products, they usually cover the distinguishing aspects of the label with their hands.  Some store associates are still needed. For example, customers purchasing alcohol must show identification.  Former Amazon executives say it likely would be difficult to scale the system to track people in a bigger store, and that it could take years to make it work in a larger store footprint. Still, they say it may make sense one day for Amazon to try to implement the technology more widely\u2014either via additional Go stores or even in Whole Foods.  Mr. Kumar said there are currently no plans to introduce the technology in Whole Foods. He added, however, that every project should be expandable.  \u201cWe have this unwritten rule that whatever it is you\u2019re building, you have to be able to scale it so that it covers significantly amount of more load than what you would normally ever expect,\u201d Mr. Kumar said.

The partnership will include opening a combined e-commerce fulfillment center in the Tokyo area to deliver groceries to a wider area.  The partnership could boost Wal-Mart \u2019s position in a promising business where Amazon isn\u2019t yet strong. Japanese spent about $19 billion on food deliveries in the year ended March 2017, including orders made in person, over the phone or online, according to Yano Research Institute. That number is growing as more women work and the elderly population rises. Rakuten shares jumped during Tokyo trading Friday when the deal was announced and closed 4.5% higher.  But Wal-Mart faces plenty of other competitors in food delivery, such as stores owned by Seven & I Holdings Co. , the Tokyo-based parent of the 7-Eleven convenience-store chain. Food cooperatives and smaller ventures that target niche markets, such as organic vegetables, are also vying for customers. Wal-Mart and Rakuten said they would offer meal kits, a product already sold by many of their rivals.  In the U.S., Wal-Mart will work with Rakuten\u2019s Canadian unit, Rakuten Kobo, to offer for the first time e-books and audiobooks in the U.S., as the company tries to make walmart.com, a destination for a wider variety of purchases and activities.  The deal \u201cenables us to quickly and efficiently launch a full eBook and audiobook catalog on Walmart.com,\u201d Scott Hilton, chief revenue officer for Wal-Mart \u2019s U.S. e-commerce unit, wrote in a blog post Thursday. The digital books could also be offered in stores.  Amazon, which started as an online bookseller and has grown rapidly into other categories, dominates the U.S. market for e-books and has sold millions of its Kindle e-readers. Kobo sells its own e-reader device, which Wal-Mart will now carry.  Wal-Mart has expanded its U.S. e-commerce sales in recent quarters after rolling out online grocery services and buying a string of online startups, including Jet.com Inc. in 2016, placing the site\u2019s founder Marc Lore at the head of U.S. e-commerce operations.  In Japan, both Rakuten and Wal-Mart are struggling to keep Amazon at bay. In 2016, Japan was the second-largest market outside the U.S. for Amazon, following Germany, with sales of $10.8 billion.  Wal-Mart has moved away from building its own stand-alone e-commerce sites and infrastructure internationally. Two years ago, Wal-Mart sold its Chinese e-commerce business Yihaodian to JD.com Inc. and holds a roughly 10% stake in China\u2019s second-largest e-commerce company after Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.  Wal-Mart and Rakuten declined to disclose the financial terms of the deal. Under pressure from Amazon, Rakuten\u2019s e-commerce profits are stalling despite growing revenue, prompting it to search for new businesses.  Last month, Rakuten said it was applying for spectrum to become Japan\u2019s fourth major cellphone carrier. Overseas, it has bought messaging app Viber and invested in ride-hailing service Lyft Inc.

AMZN -1.22% is best known for transforming the U.S. retail industry, a feat that President Donald Trump has recently attacked.  But the company has quietly been cultivating a major customer in his own backyard: the federal government.  In the past several years, the Seattle-based company has won much of the business to help the government shift computing services from legacy mainframes onto the cloud, a business where Amazon is the world leader.  This extraordinary transformation has included the provision of cloud services across Washington\u2019s bureaucracy, from the Department of Homeland Security to the Smithsonian Institution. It also has made the U.S. government a top Amazon customer.  The company doesn\u2019t release specifics, but GBH Insights, a research firm, predicts that Amazon\u2019s government business will grow to $2.8 billion in 2018 and $4.6 billion in 2019, up from less than $300 million in 2015. Other company analysts say those projections are optimistic, but not implausible.  An even bigger prize looms: Amazon is seeking a 10-year contract with the Department of Defense that could be worth $10 billion.  In Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on Amazon, suggesting the company doesn\u2019t pay its fair share of taxes and has damaged the Post Office, he hasn\u2019t mentioned Amazon\u2019s federal government business.  \u201cAmazon is just not on an even playing field,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Thursday. \u201cThey have a tremendous lobbying effort, in addition to having the Washington Post... What they have is a very uneven playing field. Look at the sales tax situation.\u201d He added, \u201cwe\u2019re going to take a pretty serious look.\u201d  Analysts say they don\u2019t see a reason to doubt Amazon will continue to rise as a major Washington contractor, though the president\u2019s criticisms have whipsawed its stock price and injected uncertainty into the equation.  \u201cThe overriding question is whether there is risk to Amazon because Trump seems to have it in for the company,\u201d said Tom Forte, an analyst at D.A. Davidson & Co.  Mr. Forte added that it would be hard for the administration to shift the government\u2019s business elsewhere because of the small number of competitors and the scale of Amazon\u2019s cloud network\u2014data-storage centers arrayed around the country and the globe that provide greater computing power and redundancy in case of emergency.  White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Wednesday that Mr. Trump is \u201cnot involved in the process\u201d of awarding the Defense Department contract.  Amazon\u2019s competitors have seized the moment to seek to slow the company\u2019s march into government business. Over dinner with Mr. Trump on Tuesday at the White House, Oracle Corp.\u2019s co-CEO, Safra Catz, complained that the Pentagon\u2019s process gives Amazon an advantage.  Amazon\u2019s growing government business coincides with a rapid rise of its presence in Washington. In 2010, the company employed eight lobbyists and spent $2.1 million lobbying federal officials, according to data compiled by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. Last year, Amazon spent $13 million and employed 95 lobbyists. Only six other companies spent more on lobbying in 2017.  Amazon has also mounted an aggressive effort to hire former government officials and executives from the company\u2019s competitors to help it navigate government procurement rules. In 2010, the company hired Teresa Carlson, who led federal sales at Microsoft Corp. Scott Renda joined the company in 2014 from the Obama administration, where he oversaw efforts to develop cloud computing.  Newsletter Sign-up  Amazon\u2019s most important early win was in 2013 with a contract to house data for intelligence agencies, including the Central Intelligence Agency. Amazon fought off a challenge from International Business Machines Corp. to retain the contract.  The intelligence community\u2019s willingness to entrust its closely held data to Amazon was a vital signal to other government agencies. Amid a general enthusiasm for using cloud computing to improve effectiveness, the CIA imprimatur suggested that Amazon Web Services, the cloud-computing division known as AWS, was a safe choice, these observers said.  Later that year, the Interior Department awarded a $10 billion contract to 10 vendors, half of whom partnered with Amazon.  In 2014, Amazon benefited from another Obama-era computing initiative: 18F, a consultancy made up of former Silicon Valley developers, which guides government agencies on software and computing procurement.  One of 18F\u2019s first projects was cloud.gov, which helps government agencies such as the Federal Election Commission move some data into the cloud. The government chose to run Cloud.gov on AWS\u2019 GovCloud service, making it easier for government agencies to purchase other Amazon services.  Related Video Amazon wants to deliver everything you want to your doorstep, anywhere in the world. WSJ's Karan Deep Singh breaks down the basics with the help of an Amazon delivery box.  Over time, Amazon has built up other security approvals from the government that allow it to store increasingly sensitive categories of data. Amazon is the only cloud company that has received approval for the government\u2019s most sensitive information.  Those security approvals have enabled Amazon to lock in an advantage over the competition, analysts say. In January, for instance, the U.S. Transportation Command, which manages transportation for the Pentagon, said it was prepared to award AWS a contract without a competitive bid. The company was the only \u201cresponsible source\u201d for the business, because it had been approved to handle government classifications up to \u201cSecret,\u201d the command said.  Amazon worked with 2,300 government entities in the U.S. and overseas in 2017, up from roughly 100 in 2011, according to data the company provided at a conference for Wall Street analysts.  Government sales have helped propel AWS to become Amazon\u2019s biggest profit source. Last year, the company\u2019s cloud computing business had $4.3 billion in operating income on $17 billion in sales, compared with operating income of $2.8 billion on sales of $106 billion at its North American retail business. Analysts estimate 10% of that comes from government contracts.  GBH Insights says Amazon is likely to win the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of $20 billion in federal cloud computing projects in the next five years. The Washington area is one of the finalists for Amazon\u2019s new \u201csecond headquarters.\u201d  The next big break could come with the Pentagon\u2019s planned $10 billion, 10-year move to the cloud. The proposed contract, called JEDI, would require a cloud infrastructure that could handle unclassified material as well as data classified as secret or top secret, defense department documents said.  Amazon\u2019s competitors worry that the Pentagon will award the contract to a single vendor, rather than multiple providers, which they say is preferable because it would provide needed redundancy in case of outages.  Competitors such as Oracle and Microsoft question the security of Amazon\u2019s cloud architecture. They also argue that Amazon could use its dominance to block other tech companies from winning government business.  A Pentagon spokesman said the department is \u201cconducting a full and open competition\u201d with \u201cno favorites.\u201d  \u2014Peter Nicholas, Gordon Lubold and Rebecca Ballhaus contributed to this article.

The outlook came on the back of the computing services and hardware firm\u2019s first quarterly revenue growth in six years.  \u201cWhile slight growth is a modest positive, we were largely underwhelmed by IBM\u2019s results, and felt the numbers showed IBM has much more work to do to turn the ship around,\u201d Deutsche Bank analyst Sherri Scribner wrote in a client note.  IBM\u2019s 3.6 percent revenue growth came mostly from a 71 percent jump in sales of its new Z14 mainframe, which was launched in September, and a 27 percent growth in its cloud business.  Several analysts pointed to the traditionally cyclical nature of mainframe revenues, which tend to surge for 2-4 quarters after the launch of a new launch before falling off.  But some said the growth since IBM launched its Z14 in September hinted at a different outcome.  Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty said the new mainframe\u2019s heightened focus on security was attracting more new customers and workloads rather than just upgrades at a time when cyberattacks and chip vulnerability are at the top of buyer\u2019s list of concerns.  A growth in the mainframe business might also improve IBM\u2019s margins. The company\u2019s fourth-quarter adjusted gross margins of 49.5 percent fell short of market expectations of 50.8 percent.  IBM has been moving away from its shrinking hardware and software businesses to what it calls \u201cstrategic imperatives,\u201d which includes the contribution of cloud computing \u2013 where companies use a remote network of data centers instead of their own hardware to cut costs.  Strategic Imperatives grew 14 percent in the quarter.  \u201cLooking under the surface, however, it appears that strategic imperatives excluding Systems only grew 6 percent, largely driven by the lack of Cognitive Solutions growth,\u201d Berenberg analyst Josep Bori said.  \u201cThis is clearly not enough to offset the declining core business,\u201d he said.  IBM said it would continue to \u201cmaintain a high level of investment\u201d in 2018 as it boosts its capabilities on cloud, mobile, cybersecurity and data analytics.  \u201cThis quarter was another important step in the right direction with 2018 a major prove me year for IBM to show the turnaround story is viable, which we believe it is, albeit at a snail-like pace,\u201d GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives said.", "stock": "IBM", "label": -1, "date": "2018-01-19", "source": "reuters", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ibm-results-research/ibm-shares-fall-on-soft-profit-outlook-idUSKBN1F81QV"}, {"article": "(Reuters) - Shares in International Business Machines rose nearly 2 percent on Wednesday, helped by a double-notch upgrade for the company from Barclays ahead of fourth-quarter results on Thursday.

The company, which will report after U.S. markets close on Thursday, trumped Wall Street\u2019s estimates for both profit and revenue in the third quarter ended Sept. 30.  While total revenue in that quarter fell 0.4 percent, the 22nd straight quarterly fall, it was also the smallest quarterly drop since the third quarter of 2016.  Moskowitz said IBM\u2019s revenue may prove stable or even grow over the next 12-18 months.  He also argued that recently disclosed Spectre and Meltdown processor security flaws could allow IBM to gain share in the mid-range and high-end server market.  IBM last month launched Power9 processors, designed for cloud computing and machine learning, to better compete with the likes of Intel and Advanced Micro Devices Inc.  A fix for Meltdown, which only affects Intel chips, could lower performance by 30 percent in some cases, pushing customers to look for new processors, potentially lifting both IBM\u2019s market share and revenue, Moskowitz wrote.  In a blog post dated Jan. 15, IBM said firmware patches for Power9 platforms were available to fix the security flaws.

Pedestrians pass a video advertisement for IBM at their office in Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S., January 16, 2018. REUTERS/Brian Snyder  Armonk, New York-based IBM on Monday sued its former chief diversity officer, Lindsay-Rae McIntyre, who left for a similar job at Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O). The lawsuit alleges McIntyre violated a one-year non-competition agreement and could disclose IBM\u2019s diversity data and hiring plans.  IBM\u2019s stance puts it at odds with trends in the tech industry and broader corporate world towards sharing diversity success stories and best practices, instead seeming to view diversity as a zero-sum game.  The lawsuit is unusual because IBM is arguing its diversity data and strategy are economically valuable \u201ctrade secrets,\u201d a legal term typically associated with closely guarded formulas like that for Coca-Cola. It appears to be the first company to bring such a lawsuit against a rival over diversity efforts, legal experts said.  IBM cited in its complaint McIntyre\u2019s knowledge and oversight of its plans to hire 50 diverse candidates to executive positions and its development of artificial intelligence-based tools to track the career development of women and minorities at the company.  According to IBM, knowledge of this \u201chighly confidential, proprietary, and competitively sensitive information\u201d would allow Microsoft to compete for the same talent and business from customers that value diversity.  Once synonymous with white men in dark suits, IBM created task forces in 1995 to address the issue and soon greatly increased the diversity of its management.  Y-Vonne Hutchinson, an Oakland, California-based diversity consultant and lawyer who works with the tech industry, said IBM has had a legitimate edge over its industry rivals when it comes to diversity.  IBM\u2019s tools for reaching it diversity goals could qualify as trade secrets if it can show they are valuable to competitors, said Villanova University law professor Michael Risch.  IBM said in a statement that it \u201chas a long history of being recognized for leadership in a diverse and inclusive workplace.\u201d  Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft, which is not named in IBM\u2019s lawsuit, said it had no interest in IBM\u2019s confidential information.  \u2018PUBLIC CONDEMNATION\u2019  Russell Beck, a lawyer specializing in trade secrets law, said he was surprised to see IBM make such nakedly economic arguments about diversity, noting that corporations more typically cast their efforts as benefiting society as a whole.  Most large tech firms have long faced criticism for the lack of diversity of their staffs. IBM took a shot at Microsoft in its lawsuit, noting that the latter company has faced \u201cpublic condemnation and class action litigation\u201d for its struggles to recruit and promote women.  Microsoft is seeking to dismiss as without merit a class action alleging pay and promotion discrimination.  Microsoft and IBM both derive much of their revenue from selling software and cloud computing services to big companies, a number of which have said they seek diversity in their vendors and suppliers.  Other tech companies have previously argued for the confidentiality of diversity information, though more out of fear of public criticism and litigation than competition, said John Cary Sims, a professor at McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento, California.  But more have recently embraced transparency. In 2014, Google released diversity data after previously trying to keep it private. Apple and Microsoft have also made their data public.  Joelle Emerson, a consultant who has advised Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and Airbnb Inc on diversity efforts, criticized IBM\u2019s position.  \u201cIf you truly want to build a better industry, sharing learnings is actually a really helpful part of that,\u201d she said.  \u201cUltimately, a more diverse tech industry benefits every company within that industry.\u201d", "stock": "IBM", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-14", "source": "reuters", "url": "https://ca.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idCAKCN1FY38Z-OCATC"}, {"article": "(Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) sued its former executive Lindsay-Rae McIntyre, who was named Microsoft Corp\u2019s (MSFT.O) new chief diversity officer over the weekend, alleging violation of a one-year non-competitive agreement.

REUTERS/Chris Helgren/File Photo  The global shipping industry has seen little innovation since the container was invented in the 1950s, and cross-border trade still leaves an enormous trail of paperwork and bureaucracy.  Success of the platform, which will be made available to the ocean shipping industry around mid-2018, depends on whether Maersk and IBM can convince shippers, freight forwarders, ocean carriers, ports and customs authorities to sign up.  Blockchain technology powers the digital currency bitcoin and enables data sharing across a network of individual computers.  It will help manage and track tens of millions of shipping containers globally by digitizing the supply chain process from end to end, the companies said.  \u201cThe big thing that is missing from this industry to digitize and unleash the potential of the technology is really to create a form of utility that brings standards across the entire ecosystem,\u201d Maersk\u2019s Chief Commercial Officer Vincent Clerc said in an interview.

IBM shares were down 3.3 percent at 7:16 a.m. in pre-market trading in New York Friday.  Much of the growth fueling IBM\u2019s $22.5 billion in fourth-quarter revenue came from its new mainframe servers. Customers from banks to health-care companies are buying the hardware and accompanying software for their own data centers to run large applications -- from financial transactions to customer billing.

In addition, the company said it expects its tax rate to rise in 2018 as a result of the bill, which includes a lower corporate tax rate offset by a broader tax base and reduced foreign tax credit utilization.  Tax Headwinds  The tax headwinds, combined with the one-time charge, threw \u201cone big wrench in the wheel\u201d and could also be why investors are reacting negatively, said David Holt, an analyst at CFRA Research.  Profit, excluding some items, was $5.18 a share in the quarter. Analysts projected $5.17. IBM fell 1 cent short of the average analyst estimate of $13.81 a share for the full year. Under generally accepted accounting principles, IBM reported a loss for the quarter including the tax charge. The shares fell as much as 4.8 percent to $161 in extended trading.  Over the last six years, Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty assured investors that she would refocus IBM\u2019s business on emerging technologies -- such as cloud and artificial intelligence -- and stem the revenue decline. She shed units, invested in cloud data centers and bought a number of companies to boost sales, bolster technology offerings and add troves of data to help train AI algorithms. But those investments have yet to pay off, and analysts have said that IBM\u2019s turnaround is still in the works.  The shares took a beating last year, after the company missed sales estimates in the first half. The stock then rallied the most since 2009 after the company forecast revenue would increase in the fourth quarter. Analysts have said that shows investors care most about getting back to sales growth. One quarter of expansion doesn\u2019t a successful turnaround make, and it\u2019s now critical for IBM to sustain improving revenue this year.  \u201cRevenue growth has been what investors have been wanting to see,\u201d Holt said. \u201cWhen you pull back the layers, all the segments are churning, and fundamentals are pointing in the right direction.\u201d  The company projected revenue growth in 2018, regardless of currency trends. New Chief Financial Officer Jim Kavanaugh said that will be achieved in part by gains in software-as-a-service as well as IBM\u2019s global business services operations -- an area that has struggled in recent years.  Strategic Imperatives Goal  Rometty had set a goal for IBM to reach $40 billion in strategic imperative revenue this year, which would mean those newer products would make up more than half of the company\u2019s business. Kavanaugh said the company will achieve that goal and continue to increase strategic imperative sales at least at a percentage in the the double digits.  Should IBM increase revenue in global business services as promised by the end of the year, that would reverse continuous declines of more than a year, Holt said. This is an area IBM has invested heavily in to shift the focus and skills of its employees onto projects in digital and cloud-based technologies.  Gross margins were 49.5 percent, missing the average analyst estimate of 50.9 percent, in part because measures to cut expenses took longer to pay off, the company said. While margins improved sequentially as promised, this is the ninth straight quarter that they shrank compared with the same period the prior year. Gross margins will stabilize this year, helped by the expense cutting, higher sales in more profitable products and increased scale on the cloud business, Kavanaugh said. However, currency hedges and plans to continue investing will offset some of that benefit, he said.  Revenue from the systems unit, which houses hardware and operating systems software, grew 32 percent. Typically an area of decline, sales of mainframe servers, as well as accompanying software, helped boost the group.  Sales in the cognitive solutions unit, which houses analytics software and the AI products branded under Watson, grew 2.5 percent to $5.4 billion. Technology services and cloud platforms, the unit that includes IBM\u2019s cloud infrastructure and platform offerings as well as its consulting business, posted a revenue decline of 1.2 percent, in part because some of its legacy software sales with bigger upfront revenue shifted to the cloud.  Last week, IBM named Kavanaugh to be the new CFO, while Martin Schroeter will be taking on a new role as the senior vice president of global markets.

His conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., reported that it cut its stake in Big Blue by 94 percent during the fourth quarter, essentially drawing to a close a rare blemish on his investing record.  The move was disclosed in a regulatory filing Wednesday that also showed Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire increased its investment in Apple Inc., now valued at nearly $28 billion. And it initiated a new holding in Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., worth about $365 million, in the final three months of last year.  IBM was always a curiosity for Buffett followers. He\u2019d spent years telling them that technology companies were outside his area of expertise then plowed more than $10 billion into the company in 2011.  Flawed Valuation  Back then, Buffett\u2019s investment was a huge vote of confidence for the aging computer-services firm and its leadership. But things soon went south. IBM struggled with declining sales, forcing Buffett to defend the pick. For awhile, he even added some to his holdings.  Last year, however, he\u2019d had enough. Just before Berkshire\u2019s annual meeting in May, he acknowledged that his valuation had been flawed and that he\u2019d begun to cut back on the investment.  Buffett had hinted he might sell additional IBM shares before the end of last year. Since some of the stock traded below his purchase price, it would have been advantageous for Berkshire to recognize a loss when tax rates were higher, he said this January. Berkshire\u2019s stake in the company stood at just 2 million shares at the end of December, which have a market value of about $309 million.  Missed Opportunities  The episode has highlighted just how badly Buffett missed opportunities in tech companies that have come to dominate the ranks of the world\u2019s most valuable enterprises. At the annual meeting, he issued a mea culpa, adding that he \u201cblew it\u201d by failing to invest early in Google despite having plenty of chances to learn about and understand its business model.  In a sign of his new thinking, Buffett plowed billions of dollars into Apple starting in 2016. He added more to that investment in the fourth quarter, boosting Berkshire\u2019s total stake in the iPhone maker by 23 percent to about 165 million shares.  While much smaller, Berkshire\u2019s new investment in Teva may capture investor attention. The drugmaker has lost more than two-thirds of its value in the last two years. New Chief Executive Officer Kare Schultz has been making major changes since taking over in November. He\u2019s told investors to brace for an ugly ride that won\u2019t be over this year, and gave a 2018 earnings forecast far below investors\u2019 expectations.  To clean up some of the company\u2019s more than $30 billion in debt, Schultz said he\u2019ll cut about 25 percent of jobs at the company -- a step that past CEOs have been unwilling to take given Teva\u2019s close ties to its home market in Israel. He\u2019s also reorganized the drugmaker\u2019s management, and said it will eliminate some money-losing products.  After Berkshire\u2019s new holding was disclosed, Teva\u2019s American Depository Receipts surged 8 percent.  Some other notable changes to Berkshire\u2019s portfolio:  The stake in Bank of New York Mellon Corp. climbed 21 percent to 60.8 million shares  The holding in Monsanto Co. rose 32 percent to 11.7 million shares  The holding in American Airlines Group Inc. was lowered by 1 million shares to 46 million.  \u2014 With assistance by Drew Armstrong", "stock": "IBM", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-14", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-14/warren-buffett-s-berkshire-cuts-almost-its-entire-stake-in-ibm"}, {"article": "Siemens AG is joining with companies including Airbus SE and IBM to try to counter large-scale hacking attacks that threaten to cost $8 trillion in damage over the next five years.  The group signed a charter Friday at a security conference in Munich urging stronger safeguards against assaults on digital systems that control homes, hospitals, factories and nearly all infrastructure. The charter aims to set a standard for companies to find trustworthy business partners, or avoid those outside that circle, Siemens Chief Executive Officer Joe Kaeser said.  \u201cIf companies along the value chain share their experiences, then we can prevent a lot of things,\u201d said Kaeser, who helped initiate the charter. Conversely, \u201cif you haven\u2019t established a certain set of elements, then you\u2019re not part of the it. There has to be a unified approach.\u201d  The initiative comes amid an ongoing investigation in the U.S. into allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 election, and after computer malware has already shown its ability to spread through systems worldwide. Last year\u2019s WannaCry ransomware crippled parts of Britain\u2019s National Health Service and infected more than 300,000 computers across 150 countries. The cost of cyber-crime to firms over the next five years could reach $8 trillion, the World Economic Forum said in a report in January.  Signatories of the Munich charter, which also include Allianz AG, Daimler AG, NXP Semiconductors NV, SGS SA and Deutsche Telekom AG, are calling for governments and companies to take responsibility for digital security at the highest levels. They suggest governments set up dedicated ministries devoted to the issue.  Societal Breakdown    Airbus CEO Tom Enders said his company now employs about 1,000 people dealing with a response to cyber attacks, a number he estimates will rise tenfold or more in the next decade, highlighting how the issue is becoming an increasingly central part of large companies\u2019 organisation. New-generation aircraft contain tens of thousands of sensors and are increasingly connected via mobile networks, making the storage and securing of data increasingly complex, he said.  Still, most of of the security breaches that are disclosed via government agencies to companies typically come from the either the U.S. or the U.K., evidence that other European political institutions must do more to collaborate with companies, Enders said.  \u201cWe must not be afraid to share information freely between governments, government agencies and industries,\u201d Enders said.  Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said the issue \u201c\u2018will certainly be a focus\u201d of the country\u2019s Group of Seven presidency this year.

The Phoenix project was originally chosen by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s Conservative predecessors 10 years ago to centralize the government payroll. International Business Machines Corp. won the contract to install and help run the system, which uses Oracle Corp. software.  It went live in 2016, just months after Trudeau won office. From the beginning, it didn\u2019t work like it was supposed to. Some people were paid too much, others not at all. Those issues snowballed with the deluge of requests to fix incorrect paychecks. The fear of not getting paid still hangs over the country\u2019s more than 260,000 federal public servants. Some put off major financial decisions. Others declined promotions or retirement, fearing any change in their pay could cause more trouble.  Two years later, some employees are still having problems. The latest data showed a backlog of 384,000 cases linked to the program.  IBM said it\u2019s \u201cfulfilling its obligations on the Phoenix contract, and the software is functioning as intended.\u201d The company \u201ccontinues to work in partnership with the government\u2019s efforts to resolve the project\u2019s issues, and remains committed to the project\u2019s overall success,\u201d it said in a statement.  An Oracle representative declined to comment.  Debi Daviau, president of one of the main unions representing government workers, said the blame falls mostly on the senior government officials who ran the project and opened it even though there were glaring warning signs it wasn\u2019t ready. But she also questions why IBM went ahead when it was clear there would be problems, and why the company benefits from a project that never worked as promised.  \u201cThey should have known better,\u201d Daviau said in an interview. When the company\u2019s warnings that more testing was needed went unheeded, IBM didn\u2019t put its foot down and hold up the project until it was ready, she said.  \u201cIBM got into a contract with the government that was very beneficial to IBM, which meant that the contract -- despite non-delivery -- could continue to be extended and IBM could continue to come back to the pot for money,\u201d she said.  Treasury Board President Scott Brison has said IBM has a responsibility to help the government fix the program.  \u201cIBM, as a sophisticated global company, needs to recognize that we as the government of Canada are not just an important client for IBM but there is reputational risk for IBM in not helping us fix this,\u201d Brison said last June during an appearance at the Senate\u2019s finance committee.  The fiasco illustrates how difficult it is to bring governments into the 21st century when it comes to technology, and the risks and limitations faced by companies like IBM, who get a large amount of their business from governments. IBM, based in Armonk, New York, doesn\u2019t disclose how much of its revenue comes from government contracts.  It\u2019s not the first time IBM has been embroiled in a payroll system disaster. The Australian state of Queensland scrapped a similar project after an initial contract went off the rails and ended up costing the government around A$1 billion ($772 million) to fix. A public inquiry mostly blamed government officials, but determined IBM shouldn\u2019t have been chosen for the job. IBM disputed some of the inquiry\u2019s findings in 2013.  Canadian Finance Minister Bill Morneau said Wednesday that the previous government made mistakes in dismissing staff needed to implement Phoenix but that, \u201cit\u2019s not about seeking blame, it\u2019s about trying to get it right.\u201d  Canada announced Tuesday it would start moving away from Phoenix and set aside money to find a new solution. The government will spend C$431 million to keep the program running in the near term, on top of C$460 million already spent to put Phoenix in place and fix the problems it generated.  The project was meant to save costs by firing 1,200 employees handling payroll at various departments around the country and replacing them with about 500 people in a centralized location using Phoenix to handle most of the government\u2019s payroll needs.  An inquiry from Canada\u2019s auditor general, a position similar to the U.S. Government Accountability Office, found many of the new employees were poorly trained and overworked. The software platform itself, a heavily modified version of Oracle\u2019s PeopleSoft program, had yet to be encoded with many of the payroll complexities faced by a massive and diverse public service, such as unique shift rules for Coast Guard officers or prison guards.  Phoenix is a classic example of a government wanting to save money on an expensive new technology project by cutting the number of employees working on it, only to discover later that those people were essential to seeing it through, said Nigel Wallis, a vice president with research firm IDC Canada. Other companies considered the project and decided against bidding because it looked too complex, but IBM went ahead, Wallis said.    \u201cThe promise of short term savings are often illusory,\u201d Wallis said \u201cThat\u2019s a real issue not just for government but also for a lot of large scale technology transformations. You need to approach them with a level of seriousness that I don\u2019t think necessarily was done in this instance.\u201d  Most major technology change-over projects -- for the private and public sectors -- either fail or face significant challenges, according to researcher Standish Group, which tracks thousands of projects every year.  On Wednesday, a New Democratic Party representative stood up in Parliament to ask Trudeau what he was doing for one of her constituents who was out C$40,000.  \u201cWe didn\u2019t create this mess,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cBut we are going to fix it.\u201d  \u2014 With assistance by Josh Wingrove, and Nico Grant", "stock": "IBM", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-01", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-01/canada-to-scrap-ibm-payroll-plan-gone-awry-costing-c-1-billion"}, {"article": "IBM and A.P.

The company\u2019s even resorted to selling office buildings to prop up the bottom line.  \u201cI just don\u2019t see signs of change,\u201d said Qian Kai, an analyst with CICC who\u2019s covered Lenovo for five years and the third-ranked analyst of 30 in Bloomberg\u2019s Absolute Return Rankings. He lowered his target price to HK$2.60 in February. \u201cLenovo\u2019s been caught in the middle of a very awkward situation where it can neither turn the tables on its home turf nor expand quickly enough in overseas markets.\u201d  It\u2019s a far cry from the days when Lenovo was at the top of its game. Yang took the stage at an 18,000-seat Beijing arena one frigid winter\u2019s evening in 2014 to surprise euphoric employees with news Lenovo had agreed to take over International Business Machine Corp.\u2019s commodity server business for more than $2 billion. That same year, it sealed a deal to buy Motorola Mobility from Google, becoming the world\u2019s No. 3 smartphone label.  That was then. The Moto line has tumbled out of the top ranks, unable to expand its footprint in the U.S. and pummeled by fast-moving rivals in Asia from Oppo to Xiaomi Corp. Liu Chuanzhi, an industry trailblazer who transformed Lenovo into one of China\u2019s most recognizable brands, fell on his sword during this year\u2019s address.  \u201cHow many mistakes have we made? How many mistakes have I myself made?\u201d Liu said in February. \u201cWithout question, today\u2019s Lenovo Group faces severe and acute challenges. The challenge is multi-dimensional and uncertain. It\u2019s an age when innovations in technology and business model are powerful enough to overturn an industry and even social customs.\u201d  Lenovo\u2019s now overhauling its sales channel. It\u2019s re-enlisted Liu Jun -- the architect of the Motorola deal -- to reinvigorate China via new avenues such as e-commerce.  \u201cTurning around the business is still our goal, but we probably need more quarters to deliver that result,\u201d Yang said in an interview in February. \u201cWe are transitioning in emerging markets from Lenovo brand to Motorola brand, it hasn\u2019t gone very well. We need to clear inventory and rebuild the brand.\u201d  Perennial Laggard Lenovo consistently trails its peers on blended price-earnings multiples Source: Bloomberg  It also missed out on \u201cits best shot\u201d to grow its server business, Qian said. At the time the IBM deal was unveiled, Chinese customers were starting to eschew IBM, Oracle and EMC in favor of local names. Many ended up with Huawei or Inspur because Lenovo took eight months to close its acquisition.  Lately, the company\u2019s shown signs of life. It\u2019s expected to return to (meagre) revenue growth this fiscal year after two successive annual declines. But at least one fund manager warns against getting into a PC sector that remains sluggish at best.  \u201cThe industry is unlikely to see hyper-growth in the short run,\u201d said Zhang Haidong, a fund manager with Jinkuang Investment Management who doesn\u2019t own stock in Lenovo. Even \u201cthe smartphone business may not see its next inflection point until 2019.\u201d  Alexander Medd, an analyst with Bucephalus Research who\u2019s been one of Lenovo\u2019s harshest critics, argues the company needs cool products. But it may be too late.  \u201cTech brands do not come back,\u201d he said.  \u2014 With assistance by Yuan Gao, and Amanda Wang", "stock": "IBM", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-27", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-27/watch-out-lenovo-s-downward-spiral-may-not-be-over-just-yet"}, {"article": "With the technology sector making headlines left and right, Morgan Stanley is optimistic about the future of both the industry and its stocks.

They see an opportunity for data technologies to push forward $1.6 trillion in incremental IT investment in 10 years, more than double the $740 billion on average that was added in each of the previous three cycles.  Morgan Stanley noted signs of a scenario \u201cbeginning to play out\u201d in which semiconductors have taken the lead as the best-performing sector in 2017.

Companies use blockchain and other so-called digital ledgers to securely record transactions and process other data over the internet -- a service Google could use, for example, to reassure customers that their information is protected when stored on the giant network of computer servers that power its cloud services.  The Alphabet Inc. unit is developing its own distributed digital ledger that third parties can use to post and verify transactions, one of the people said. Although the timing of any product release is unclear, the company plans to offer this to differentiate its cloud service from rivals. It will also provide a white-label version that other companies can run on their own servers, the person added.  The internet giant has also been acquiring and investing in startups with digital ledger expertise. Many of the deals haven\u2019t been announced, the person said. Still, Alphabet was a leading corporate investor in the field last year, ahead of Citigroup Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., according to research firm CB Insights.  Several people in Google\u2019s infrastructure group, which reports to cloud chief Diane Greene, have been tinkering with blockchain protocols in recent months, according to another person familiar with the company. Other Google insiders said recently that the cloud business is a natural place for blockchain-related services. The people asked not to be identified talking about the subject because the company isn\u2019t ready to make an announcement yet.  \u201cLike many new technologies, we have individuals in various teams exploring potential uses of blockchain but it\u2019s way too early for us to speculate about any possible uses or plans,\u201d a Google spokesman said.  In 2016, Google started a trial for developers testing blockchain services on its cloud. The company is now exploring much more expansive ways to deploy the technology, the people said.  Digital ledgers like blockchain power Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. They are databases that are updated regularly across thousands of computers over the internet. Each entry is confirmed by these machines, which can be part of public networks or run privately by companies. There are different kinds of digital ledgers -- blockchain is only one. Data crunched by this technology range from transactions to supply-chain updates to digital cats.  The technology presents challenges and opportunities for Google. Distributed networks of computers that run digital ledgers can eliminate risks that come with information held centrally by a single company. While Google\u2019s security is strong, it\u2019s one of the largest holders of information in the world. The decentralized approach is also beginning to support new online services that compete with Google.  Still, the company is an internet pioneer and has long experience embracing new and open web standards. To build its ledger, Google has looked at technology from the Hyperledger consortium, but it could opt for another type that may be easier to scale to run millions of transactions, one of the people familiar with the situation said.  \"Any time there\u2019s a paradigm shift like this, there\u2019s an opportunity for new giants to emerge -- but also for incumbents to adopt the new approach,\" said Elad Gil, a startup investor who worked on early mobile projects at Google more than a decade ago.  Sridhar Ramaswamy, Google\u2019s advertising chief, said at a recent conference that his division has a \"small team\" looking at blockchain, but noted the existing core technology can\u2019t handle a lot of transactions quickly. Some marketing firms have started to explore blockchain\u2019s potential to facilitate digital ad buying without using Google and Facebook Inc., the two dominant industry players.  When Alphabet wants to keep up with emerging technology, it often backs startups in the field and makes small acquisitions to recruit talent. GV, Alphabet\u2019s venture capital arm, has invested in wallet service Blockchain Luxembourg, financial transactions network Ripple, cryptocurrency asset management platform LedgerX, international payments provider Veem and the now-defunct Buttercoin, according to CB Insights.  Global Blockchain Spending IBM, Microsoft benefit the most from distributed ledger technology Source: WinterGreen Research Inc.  Among tech giants, IBM and Microsoft Corp. have so far led the charge in offering blockchain-related tools and letting companies tinker with digital ledgers using their cloud services. The market for blockchain products and services may grow from $706 million last year to more than $60 billion in 2024, according to WinterGreen Research. Cloud\u2019s 800-pound gorilla, Amazon.com Inc., helps companies build blockchain applications, and Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg is looking at cryptocurrencies, encryption and other decentralized computing approaches.  A slew of startups are trying to challenge Google\u2019s online dominance by using digital ledgers. Brave is a web browser that competes with Google\u2019s Chrome. Instead of running targeted ads, Brave uses blockchain technology to pay websites when people spend time there. BitClave lets people perform searches online, and get rewarded for seeing ads. Another project, Presearch, is also using blockchain to try to compete with Google\u2019s search engine, according to a white paper by the startup.  \"You\u2019re going to see an unbelievable amount of R&D expenditures go into this,\" said Jeff Richards, a managing partner at venture firm GGV Capital. \"Everybody learned from the internet and mobile that you can\u2019t afford to wait.\"  \u2014 With assistance by Joe Mayes", "stock": "IBM", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-21", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-21/google-is-said-to-work-on-its-own-blockchain-related-technology"}, {"article": "When the U.S. government waves the flag of patriotism and national interest, Broadcom Ltd. tries to wave it even harder.  The company that wants to buy computer-chip maker Qualcomm Inc. got a dose of unwanted news earlier this week. The committee that reviews foreign corporations' acquisitions of American companies wrote an extraordinary letter to Broadcom that said, essentially, that the U.S. government is not inclined to look kindly on a combination of Singapore-based Broadcom and Qualcomm.  Reading between the lines of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., at least some U.S. government officials are worried about the potential for China -- and particularly China's telecom equipment powerhouse Huawei -- to dictate the next generation of mobile internet technology, known as 5G. And the committee is concerned that Broadcom and its cost-cutting reputation won't be a good steward of great American hope Qualcomm, which is expected to play a critical role in the development of 5G and has strong ties to the U.S. government.  The merits of CFIUS's argument are debatable, but it's clear that Broadcom has walked into a political minefield in which the U.S. government's fear of China dominating technology standards is working against it. The company's rebuttal to CFIUS takes all those complicated political ingredients and turns them into clumsy Broadcom Jell-O.  Wrong Direction Broadcom's share price has dipped this year, indicating some investor concerns about the company's proposed Qualcomm takeover Source: Bloomberg  Broadcom pledged in a statement released on Wednesday to \"make the U.S. a global leader in 5G,\" but it was vague about how it would go about it. The company said it would maintain the research-and-development resources that Qualcomm has devoted to 5G and \"focus\" the investment to technologies that \"are essential to the U.S.\" Again, there are few specifics. That fits with Broadcom's inflexibility and vagueness in other aspects of its Qualcomm deal talks, including the uncertainty of antitrust scrutiny.  Broadcom tried to tackle one of the committee's main points by saying the company has a \"proven track record of managing R&D for maximum impact.\" But that's a euphemism for reduced spending, and CFIUS is worried that Broadcom's playbook of slashing spending at companies it acquires would weaken Qualcomm's ability to be on the vanguard of 5G technology. Broadcom most likely couldn't address this point more aggressively because the company is stretching its financial limits in the attempted $100 billion acquisition of Qualcomm and knows it must cut costs to make the deal work.  Broadcom in its letter also pledged to create a $1.5 billion fund to train engineers that would hone America's edge in wireless technology. This has all the hallmarks of companies' typical pledges when they're trying to score political points and perhaps have no plans to follow through.  IBM, also with political goals in mind, announced in late 2016 a $1 billion fund to train American workers in technology areas. If all these announcements come through, America will have the best and most expensive workforce in the world. But they won't. At least Broadcom didn't mention the mysterious $20 billion that President Trump said the company's incorporation in the U.S. would somehow deliver to American cities and workers.  A Penny for Your Thoughts Broadcom gets only a small percentage of its revenue from the U.S. Its 2017 purchase of Brocade will add about $1 billion more in North America revenue. That's still nowhere near $20 billion. Source: Bloomberg  Broadcom also waved its U.S. flag vigorously by saying it's part of the lineage of iconic American technology companies that also includes Hewlett-Packard ... and Brocade (acquired by Broadcom)? Yes, I'm sure every child in Silicon Valley knows the founding history of Broadcom and Brocade. Allow me to suggest substitutions for actually iconic American technology companies: IBM, Apple, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, Google and Facebook.  Maybe Broadcom thinks it can afford to be inept in its dealings with CFIUS because the committee won't matter. In the worst kind of political theater, Broadcom said last year that it planned to shift its official home country from Singapore to the U.S. That pending shift has the advantage of possibly removing CFIUS from the picture because Broadcom won't be a \"foreign\" acquirer anymore.  Broadcom reiterated in its statement on Wednesday that it expects that home country swap to be completed no later than May 6. A Qualcomm shareholder election that is a proxy vote on the Broadcom takeover was delayed until early April because of CFIUS's interest. It's possible Broadcom can string this all this along and hope the apparent antipathy of Qualcomm stockholders toward company management and the board can carry Broadcom to acquisition victory.  Whether this acquisition happens or not, both Qualcomm and Broadcom have been damaged. For Qualcomm, the takeover tussle fueled shareholders who were worried and angry about the company's fights with customers and regulators. Broadcom's acquisition play has exposed the limits of the company's acquire-at-all-costs blueprint and showed the company's tendency to be ham-handed politically when it needs to be adroit.  -- with assistance from Gadfly's Brooke Sutherland  This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.", "stock": "IBM", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-07", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2018-03-07/broadcom-trips-up-in-a-political-minefield-on-qualcomm"}, {"article": "Lenovo Group Ltd. has a serious problem on its hands.  It's a problem that could wipe out this year's earnings and even threaten profits next year and beyond.  Despite spending more than $5 billion in a series of acquisitions four years ago, Lenovo's attempts to bolster its mobile and server businesses haven't amounted to much. Its income statement has shown management's flailing attempts to make good on promises, which included wringing a profit out of its new mobile division within six quarters of purchase, and reaching $5 billion in annual sales from its server (aka enterprise) division.  Chronic Fatigue Lenovo's mobile and server businesses haven't made a profit since acquisitions aimed at bolstering both divisions Source: Lenovo, Bloomberg  But investors focusing on Lenovo's P&L may be missing an iceberg on its balance sheet. Lenovo paid massive premiums for the Motorola Mobility smartphone and IBM server businesses in 2014, and the goodwill section of the balance sheet is where these markups sit. This is common, because buyers usually bid up the value of the assets they're pursuing, and you can think of goodwill as the \"overpaid\" column in the spreadsheet. For Lenovo, the result was a sudden doubling to more than $5.2 billion.  Too Good Lenovo's goodwill ballooned after a series of acquisitions that were supposed to boost revenue and profits in its smaller units Source: Bloomberg  Buying assets and booking goodwill isn't a problem if the new divisions add value, usually through profits, or economies of scale that boost margins or cut costs. With the Motorola and IBM acquisitions, though, that clearly wasn't the case. So it's more likely than not that the current fair value of those units is less than the carrying amount Lenovo ascribes to them.  Breaking It Down Half of Lenovo's goodwill sits in divisions that are chronically unprofitable Source: Lenovo, Bloomberg Gadfly, Bloomberg  I choose these words carefully, because \"more likely than not\" is the term the Financial Accounting Standards Board uses to assess whether a goodwill impairment needs to be made. The IFRS Foundation, which also issues financial reporting guidelines, is a little more blunt in its IAS36 standard:  An asset must not be carried in the financial statements at more than the highest amount to be recovered through its use or sale.  Among the indications of impairment, according to the accounting firm Deloitte LLP, is whether the asset returns \"worse economic performance than expected.\"  There's absolutely no doubt, based on management's previous public statements, that those units bought at a cost of $5 billion are performing worse than expected. What's extraordinary is that after four years Lenovo hasn't recognized such impairment and allows the goodwill to sit on the balance sheet.  Reporting standards only require a test of goodwill to be done annually, so it's reasonable not to see anything announced in the past few quarters. But the company's financial year is coming to an end March 31, so the clock is ticking.  You can understand management's reticence. After a slew of deals in the late 2000s, Acer Inc., a Taiwanese PC maker, clung to inflated goodwill figures despite clear signs that the acquisitions weren't bearing fruit. In the end, it had to conduct an IAS36 impairment test and recognized a NT$9.4 billion ($335 million) writedown, enough to plunge Acer into a record annual loss and spur the ousting of its chairman and CEO.  That impairment was equivalent to about 24 percent of Acer's total intangible assets at the time. For Lenovo, I calculate it would take a mere 10.3 percent writedown to push it into a loss for the current fiscal year -- and that's only for an impairment on goodwill, and only at the mobile and server divisions. A deeper, 20 percent impairment on those units would bring about a record annual loss.  Knife Edge It would take only a small impairment of its goodwill to push Lenovo into a full-year loss for the current fiscal year Source: Bloomberg Gadfly  When Lenovo reports third-quarter earnings this week, expect management to focus again on its awesome PC division, and to continue talking up the prospects of the mobile and server units.

What\u2019s Intellectual Property and Does China Steal It?: QuickTake  U.S. President Donald Trump accused the Chinese government in March of stealing intellectual property by forcing American companies to share their most valuable secrets and sign joint venture agreements with local firms if they want to operate in China, although there are no specific allegations regarding quantum computers.  Peter Navarro, the White House trade adviser, spoke Sunday on NBC\u2019s \"Meet the Press\" about the tariffs before shifting to intellectual property.  \"What is at stake here,\" he said, \"is the industries of the future. Artificial intelligence, robotics, quantum computing. And what\u2019s at stake is not just our economic prosperity. If I may, it\u2019s also our national security. Because many of these industries of the future have profound military implications.\"  China\u2019s Innovation  China has also been aggressive in pushing home-grown innovation as it supports companies in obtaining patents and trademarks around the world, and has increased its research funding.

The Armonk, New York-based company already has developed computers being tested by customers, including Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, the Energy Department\u2019s biggest lab, as well as finance companies like JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Barclays Plc, Gil said.  \u2018Tough Problems\u2019  Intel Corp., which started its own program two years ago, said the technology promises to be \u201ctransformational.\u201d  \u201cThere are many tough problems to solve before quantum computing is a commercial reality,\u201d said Jim Clarke, director of quantum hardware at Intel. \u201cSome of these problems involve materials science, quantum chip design and manufacturing -- those are sweet-spot problems for Intel.\u201d  Clarke said Intel is competitive in the number of patents it\u2019s seeking, though many aren\u2019t yet public. Applications are made public after 18 months.  IBM Makes Breakthrough in Race to Commercialize Quantum Computers  While there will still be a place for what\u2019s being called \u201cclassical computers\u201d -- a category that includes modern smartphones and even super computers -- the quantum computers could have \u201can infinite number of applications\u201d in the fields of life sciences, chemistry and agriculture, said IBM\u2019s Gil.  \u2018Patent the Potential\u2019  It\u2019s too early to say which company or country will be the leader in quantum computers, though at this stage it looks like U.S. companies will excel in hardware while Chinese and Japanese ones are focused on the software and applications, Patinformatics\u2019 Trippe said.  \u201cJapanese and Chinese companies aren\u2019t as concerned about building them as they are about how they\u2019ll be used,\u201d Trippe said. \u201cThey\u2019ve started to patent the potential.

The World Intellectual Property Organization reported March 21 that China is closing in on the U.S. in filing international patent applications.  Quantum physics is one area in which the Chinese government, through its Ministry of Science and Technology, is beefing up its technological prowess, according to a report by the U.S. Trade Representative that laid the groundwork for Trump\u2019s tariff plans. The China Academy of Sciences and Beijing University are among the Chinese research firms seeking more patents on quantum information technology, according to Patinformatics.

IBM launched Watson Assistant, an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered voice assistant for businesses seeking to infuse voice technology into their products, at its annual Think conference on Tuesday.  IBM will license Watson Assistant to enterprises so they can build personalized, interactive experiences into their own products and services that appeal to their customers.  IBM's announcement follows Amazon's November 2017 launch of Alexa for Business platform, which enables businesses to create their own Alexa skills for both practical and business use cases.  Watson Assistant has a heightened focus on customization and privacy over voice competitors like Google and Amazon, which could make it more likely to win over businesses than Alexa or Google Assistant.  It allows for personalization to help businesses better tailor their voice interactions . Developers can create custom voice activation commands and triggers for Watson Assistant, eliminating the need for a standard universal wake word, such as \"Alexa\" or \"OK Google.\" Additionally, businesses can train their assistants using their own datasets, making it easier to build actions and commands.

This was ahead of analysts' expectations of $22.05 billion.  Yet enthusiasm on Wall Street was muted after it reported a loss of $1.14 per share versus $4.73 earnings per share in same period a year ago. This was likely on account of a one-time tax charge of $5.5 billion related to the GOP's tax reform law.

IBM's results call after U.S. markets closed on Thursday forecast an operating profit of at least $13.80 per share for 2018, compared with $13.80 in 2017 and market expectations of $13.92, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  The outlook came on the back of the computing services and hardware firm's first quarterly revenue growth in six years.  \"While slight growth is a modest positive, we were largely underwhelmed by IBM's results, and felt the numbers showed IBM has much more work to do to turn the ship around,\" Deutsche Bank analyst Sherri Scribner wrote in a client note.  IBM's 3.6 percent revenue growth came mostly from a 71 percent jump in sales of its new Z14 mainframe, which was launched in September, and a 27 percent growth in its cloud business.  Several analysts pointed to the traditionally cyclical nature of mainframe revenues, which tend to surge for 2-4 quarters after the launch of a new launch before falling off.  But some said the growth since IBM launched its Z14 in September hinted at a different outcome.  Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty said the new mainframe's heightened focus on security was attracting more new customers and workloads rather than just upgrades at a time when cyberattacks and chip vulnerability are at the top of buyer's list of concerns.  A growth in the mainframe business might also improve IBM's margins. The company's fourth-quarter adjusted gross margins of 49.5 percent fell short of market expectations of 50.8 percent.  IBM has been moving away from its shrinking hardware and software businesses to what it calls \"strategic imperatives,\" which includes the contribution of cloud computing - where companies use a remote network of data centers instead of their own hardware to cut costs.  Strategic Imperatives grew 14 percent in the quarter.  \"Looking under the surface, however, it appears that strategic imperatives excluding Systems only grew 6 percent, largely driven by the lack of Cognitive Solutions growth,\" Berenberg analyst Josep Bori said.  \"This is clearly not enough to offset the declining core business,\" he said.  IBM said it would continue to \"maintain a high level of investment\" in 2018 as it boosts its capabilities on cloud, mobile, cybersecurity and data analytics.  \"This quarter was another important step in the right direction with 2018 a major prove me year for IBM to show the turnaround story is viable, which we believe it is, albeit at a snail-like pace,\" GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives said.

Youtube  At a congressional hearing this week, Jerry Cuomo, IBM's vice president of blockchain technology, testified about the potential governmental uses for blockchains.  Identification documents, payment systems, and systems that trace the movement of foods and drugs, are among the most promising initial governmental applications for the technology, Cuomo said.  Lawmakers were wowed by how much quicker blockchain technology has made the process of tracking down food products.  IBM wants to get Uncle Sam on a blockchain.  The digital ledger technology that underlies bitcoin is ready to be used for everything from paying taxes to tracking food and drug shipments to newer, more secure identification cards, said Jerry Cuomo, vice president of blockchain technology at IBM, at a hearing Wednesday organized by the Congressional Blockchain Caucus.  \"There is an opportunity for the United States to build upon its momentum to lead blockchain by doing,\" Cuomo said in his testimony. \"We should focus our efforts on projects that can positively impact US economic competitiveness, citizens, and businesses.\"  Cuomo encouraged lawmakers to focus on incorporating blockchain technology into already established governmental projects and programs, rather than trying to start new blockchain-themed initiatives. That could help speed its use and adoption and help the US stay at the forefront of blockchain development, he said.  Government agencies at both the federal and state level are already experimenting with the technology. Some states are developing blockchain-based drivers licenses and identification cards. Meanwhile, IBM is working with the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on some blockchain projects, including one that could speed the CDC's ability to develop new drugs.  Right now, drug development involves lots of paperwork. Blockchain technology could help improve the process by putting all of the important information related to drug development in an easily accessible and secure place online.  Developing new drugs \"doesn't just take a long time because people are slow,\" Cuomo said. \"The processes are extremely paper intensive. I see these groups taking the right first steps.\"  In an interview with Business Insider, Cuomo predicted that blockchain-based digital identities will be the first big project to take off at the federal level, because officials can build off the work going on in the states.  In addition to Cuomo, Frank Yiannas, vice president of food safety at Walmart, also testified at the hearing, talking about how his company is using blockchain technology. The retail giant has teamed up with IBM to develop a blockchain designed to track the movement of produce from farmers through distributors and stores to consumers. The technology could be useful in responding to reports of food contamination, when entities like the FDA need to quickly determine which food to recall.  When Yiannas told lawmakers that the process of tracking down particular food products has gone from seven days to to 2.2 seconds, thanks to blockchain technology, they were in awe, Cuomo said.

Microsoft  IBM wanted Microsoft to provide games for its original PC \u2014 so Bill Gates took the task upon himself, working late into the night to produce the first PC game ever.  The game Gates and company came up with was \"DONKEY.BAS,\" an extremely simple and silly game about a car dodging donkeys in the road.  When Apple got their first look at the IBM PC, they thought \"DONKEY.BAS\" was particularly embarrassing, to the point where they couldn't believe Gates put his name on it.  It's the stuff of Silicon Valley legend: In 1980, a young Bill Gates convinced IBM that his tiny startup, Microsoft, was the perfect choice to provide the operating system for its new PC.  The problem was that Microsoft didn't actually have an operating system to sell. So Gates scrambled to buy one from a startup working on an operating system called 86-DOS, or \"disk operating system.\" It renamed the software PC DOS and sold it to IBM for $430,000 total.  As part of the deal, though, IBM wanted Microsoft to provide a version of BASIC, a programming language for beginners, along with a few simple games to show it off. What it came up with was \"DONKEY.BAS,\" a silly game about a car that has to avoid donkeys in the road.  It also happens to be the first PC game ever developed. Behold:  (The \".BAS\" part just means that it was written in BASIC.)  Here's how Gates described the process of building \"DONKEY.BAS\" in a 2001 keynote:  \"Actually, it was myself and Neil Konzen at four in the morning with this prototype IBM PC sitting in this small room. IBM insisted that we had to have a lock on the door, and we only had this closet that had a lock on it, so we had to do all our development in there, and it was always over 100 degrees, but we wrote late at night a little application to show what the BASIC built into the IBM PC could do. And so that was DONKEY.BAS. It was, at the time, very thrilling.\"  Andy Hertzfeld, an early Apple employee, memorably recalled the first time the Macintosh team saw an IBM PC and being especially unimpressed with the selection of games onboard. He singled out \"DONKEY.BAS\" as the \"most embarrassing game,\" saying that \"the concept of the game was as bad the crude graphics that it used.\"  Hertzfeld said of discovering this terrible game was made by none other than Gates:  \"We were surprised to see that the comments at the top of the game proudly proclaimed the authors: Bill Gates and Neil Konzen. Neil was a bright teenage hacker who I knew from his work on the Apple II (who would later become Microsoft's technical lead on the Mac project) but we were amazed that such a thoroughly bad game could be coauthored by Microsoft's cofounder, and that he would actually want to take credit for it in the comments.\"  In 2001, to show off how far the company had come, Microsoft built a 3D version of \"DONKEY.BAS,\" called \"DONKEY.NET,\" where the aim is to hit donkeys with a car. You can download a version of it, but it's difficult to get running on modern systems.  The IBM PC. Wikimedia Commons  But if you want to play the original \"DONKEY.BAS,\" you're in luck. MIT is hosting a browser-based version, while an enterprising developer built an iPhone and Apple Watch version that you can buy for 99 cents. You can also play another early DOS game, \"GORILLAS.BAS,\" in the browser.  Gates became a massive fan of another classic Microsoft game: He was such a fan of Minesweeper that he had to delete it from his computer to stay productive \u2014 still, he would end up sneaking into his executives' offices to play it.", "stock": "IBM", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-02", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://uk.businessinsider.com/bill-gates-donkey-bas-game-2017-2?r=US&amp;IR=T"}, {"article": "IBM CEO Ginni Rometty IBM  IBM told investors Thursday that it has over 400 clients with projects on its blockchain platform.  Among its biggest clients are companies like Walmart and Nestl\u00e9. It also disclosed a list of banks and trade companies using its blockchain.  Blockchain technology is often associated with cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, but enterprises are taking it on as a new tool for trade and payments.  IBM's foray into blockchain technology is catching on with customers, according to an investor briefing shared by the company on Thursday.  At least 400 IBM customers are now running blockchain-based projects, according to the briefing. Among those customers are 63 that work together with certain themes: 25 companies in global trade, 14 companies in food tracking, and 14 companies in global payments. Some of IBM's most recognizable blockchain clients include Nestl\u00e9, Visa, Walmart, and HSBC.  While blockchains continue to be widely associated with startups and crypto-millionaires, IBM's client list shows that large enterprises are truly embracing the technology.  IBM and Walmart actually launched a joint food safety blockchain project globally last year, which enables the grocery chain to figure out where specific produce originated in a matter of seconds.  Why the blockchain?  Blockchains, the technology that underlies cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, have caught on in enterprise as an efficient and comprehensive way of tracking both physical and digital items \u2014 from inventory to online payments. Often, these blockchains are decentralized, meaning they're spread across many machines on a network. This redundancy makes it difficult for any one party to falsify the information contained on the blockchain.  Conventionally, blockchains like the one that powers bitcoin are public, so that anyone can see the changes that are made. It's an important aspect of most cryptocurrencies that the blockchain is accessible to all, to eliminate the possibility of shady dealings.  But IBM's product, which is built on top of an open-source blockchain called Hyperledger Fabric, uses \"permissioned networks.\" This means companies can have some of the information on their bespoke blockchain be publicly viewable, and some of it locked behind a password or other security mechamism.  A global trader like the Dow Chemical Company (an IBM blockchain user) may want to have an immutable receipt between itself and its trade partners in order to guarantee that no one is being scammed. But it doesn't necessarily want that information to be viewable by its competitors \u2014 or, say, the media.  In global shipping, IBM's clients include Maersk, Du Pont and Dow Chemical. Its food trust customers include Walmart, Nestl\u00e9, Kroger and Unilever. Its global payment customers include Visa, the Polynesian payments company KlickEx, EarthPort, Nab,, BBVA and CIBC. And in trade finance, IBM's customers include Societe General, WeTrade, HSBC, Unicredit, and Santander.  They're not the only ones rushing towards the blockchain, either. JD.com, the Amazon of China, is launching a project to put high-end beef imports on a blockchain so that its customers can see where their meat has been.

Anne McKee started coding just three years ago with a class at a local community college.  McKee was one of three global winners among 17,000 students that participated in this year's competition.  Mainframes are still widely in use at banks, insurance companies, and other big businesses that handle lots of credit card transactions.  You might think of the mainframe computer as long-gone relic of the Cold War. But banks, especially, still rely on modern versions of the old classic: They're huge and old-fashioned, sure, but they're also proven to be mega-reliable.  Fast forward to today, and meet Anna McKee, a 22-year-old college senior at the University of North Texas, who was named the winner of the IBM Master of the Mainframe programming contest last week \u2014 making her the first woman from North America to take the title.  \"I started saying 'oh my gosh' repeatedly and my poor parents who I was on the phone with thought I got into a car accident or something,\" McKee told Business Insider, of the moment she won. \"And then they just started yelling on the other end. They were so excited. It was awesome.\"  McKee was, truly, shocked that she would win. She had only started coding three years earlier, starting with a class at a local community college. She entered the contest thinking she would have a hard time even completing it. She never thought she actually stood a chance. In fact, she only competed because both of her parents work with mainframes, and urged her to enter.  Her prizes: A $2,750 travel stipend to go to the closest IBM head office to meet with executives and recruiters; an HTC Vive virtual reality headset; a \"Master of the Mainframe\" hoodie.  The learning curve  The mainframe might have fallen out of favor, as PCs, smartphones, and now cloud computing give people access to so much computing power in much smaller packages. The problem is that, even though mainframes are still so critical at many businesses, programming novices are getting drawn to the newer platforms, causing a huge skills shortage.  That's part of why IBM has run the Master of the Mainframe competition since 2005, as a way to entice students to learn the intracicies of the mainframe.  \"We really want to give students a learning opportunity on one of the world's biggest enterprise IT platforms,\" Meredith Stowell, director of community engagement and skills for IBM's Mainframe team, told Business Insider.

Contestants connect to a IBM mainframe virtually, from a terminal on their own computer.  Contestants have three months to complete the Master of the Mainframe challenge. McKee finished in two weeks.  \"I worked day and night to complete it,\" McKee said. \"Everything else, my homework and everything, was put on the back burner.\"  In high school, McKee was particularly adept at math and music, but didn't know how that could translate into a career. On a whim, during the summer after her freshman year of college, McKee enrolled in a basic C++ programming course at a nearby community college. She struggled through it, but she was \"intrigued\" and decided to sign up for a class in the Java programming language. IBM  That's when things changed. She enjoyed programming in Java so much, she declared a major in business computer information systems. She also joined the Association for Information Systems, a professional association for the IT industry.  And she's noticed a promising change, too. Over the past year, McKee said, more women have been attending AIS meetings. A few weeks before IBM told McKee she won Master of the Mainframe, she noticed something unusual at the latest AIS meeting: the room was about 50% women.  \"It's something that really surprised me and I really hope that things are shifting so that more women are getting into technology,\" she said.", "stock": "IBM", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-25", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/ibm-master-of-the-mainframe-winner-anna-mccay-interview-2018-3"}, {"article": "Skeptics abound.

The AT&T-IBM collaboration involves breaking down programs into cloud-based building blocks of code called microservices, each of which handles a certain task. So a new feature for mobile payments, for example, can be adopted quickly by updating a few lines of code rather than having to rewrite an entire program.

Most of this business software uses cloud technology that runs inside AT&T data centers \u2014 in a so-called private cloud, in contrast to a public cloud in which computing services are delivered from remote data centers owned by another company. Many corporations opt for private clouds to house their most sensitive customer and business data.  \u201cFor certain parts of our business, IBM was the ideal partner,\u201d Mr. Saxena said.  IBM emphasizes its hybrid stance in the cloud market, offering both private and public cloud technology to its corporate clients. In its financial reporting, IBM also includes all the hardware, software and services it sells to companies to build private clouds in its total cloud revenue, which would put it on a par with Amazon.  Most industry analysts focus on the public cloud market, assuming it will grow faster as companies build fewer data centers themselves. In the public cloud market, IBM has revenue of about $2 billion a year, growing at 30 percent, according to the most recent estimate by IDC. By contrast, Amazon generates more than $12 billion a year and Microsoft about $6.5 billion.  Yet for IBM, its underlying cloud software is crucial to building a big A.I. business with Watson. \u201cIBM has a strong set of assets in A.I.,\u201d said Ed Anderson, an analyst at Gartner. \u201cAnd cloud is the answer to getting Watson in the hands of developers.\u201d  Photo  That was the appeal for Opentopic, a start-up that uses A.I. technology to mine online and corporate data for marketing insights. Opentopic switched from Amazon Web Services to the IBM cloud in 2015, largely to tap Watson\u2019s code modules for text, image and sentiment analysis, so the Opentopic developers had to write less code themselves.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  \u201cIt allows us to prototype rapidly,\u201d said Andre Konig, a co-founder of Opentopic. \u201cAnd Watson is the artificial intelligence layer that makes that possible.\u201d  The start-up\u2019s clients include Unilever, Abbott Laboratories and The Economist. Today, Opentopic does all its software development on the IBM cloud, but that will most likely change soon.  It is working with a new company that runs its business on the Amazon cloud. \u201cWe need to be where our customers are,\u201d Mr. Konig said. \u201cThe future is going to be multi-cloud,\u201d meaning businesses will use various services.  His comment points to a brewing issue for IBM \u2014 and perhaps one that will help determine the resilience of Ms. Rometty\u2019s turnaround campaign.  IBM is putting all its advanced technology on the cloud \u2014 not just artificial intelligence, but also blockchain and quantum computing. If others are leaders in the underlying cloud layers, why not focus higher up and distribute its leading-edge technology on other clouds as well?  IBM says its Watson software, for example, is fine-tuned down to the chip level for the IBM cloud. But some analysts suggest that IBM may eventually take another path, working with Amazon, Microsoft and Google.  \u201cIf IBM does that,\u201d said Frank Gens, IDC\u2019s chief analyst, \u201cits chance of being a cloud leader goes way up.\u201d", "stock": "IBM", "label": -1, "date": "2018-01-17", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/17/technology/ibm-earnings.html"}, {"article": "Photo  IBM reported revenue growth for the first time in five and a half years on Thursday, ending a streak of 22 consecutive quarters of shrinking sales.

The quarterly result will also not erase the doubts of industry analysts who are skeptical that a genuine turnaround is underway at IBM.  But the company\u2019s fourth-quarter report is an encouraging sign that IBM\u2019s financial performance is stabilizing, and perhaps the transformation effort led by Virginia M.

Most of the handful of chiefs who have spoken out against Facebook have long been forthright on the topic of privacy.

Wallis, during their train commutes between Manhattan and Westchester County. Mr. Wallis persuaded Mr. Rice to join the bank, and later turned the leadership reins over to him.

He served on the boards of several public companies, including Avon Products and Apache Corporation, and was the chairman of the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation\u2019s board of trustees from 1997 to 2013.  His business career took him to 57 countries. He was often accompanied on those trips by his wife, Katharine Wolfe Rice, whom he married in 1948 and who was known as Kay. She died in 2013.

Today, facial recognition software is being deployed by companies in various ways, including to help target product pitches based on social media profile pictures. But companies are also experimenting with face identification and other A.I. technology as an ingredient in automated decisions with higher stakes like hiring and lending.  Researchers at the Georgetown Law School estimated that 117 million American adults are in face recognition networks used by law enforcement \u2014 and that African Americans were most likely to be singled out, because they were disproportionately represented in mug-shot databases.  Facial recognition technology is lightly regulated so far.  \u201cThis is the right time to be addressing how these A.I. systems work and where they fail \u2014 to make them socially accountable,\u201d said Suresh Venkatasubramanian, a professor of computer science at the University of Utah.  Until now, there was anecdotal evidence of computer vision miscues, and occasionally in ways that suggested discrimination. In 2015, for example, Google had to apologize after its image-recognition photo app initially labeled African Americans as \u201cgorillas.\u201d  Sorelle Friedler, a computer scientist at Haverford College and a reviewing editor on Ms. Buolamwini\u2019s research paper, said experts had long suspected that facial recognition software performed differently on different populations.  \u201cBut this is the first work I\u2019m aware of that shows that empirically,\u201d Ms. Friedler said.  Ms. Buolamwini, a young African-American computer scientist, experienced the bias of facial recognition firsthand. When she was an undergraduate at the Georgia Institute of Technology, programs would work well on her white friends, she said, but not recognize her face at all. She figured it was a flaw that would surely be fixed before long.  Photo  But a few years later, after joining the M.I.T. Media Lab, she ran into the missing-face problem again. Only when she put on a white mask did the software recognize hers as a face.

Now 28 and a doctoral student, after studying as a Rhodes scholar and a Fulbright fellow, she is an advocate in the new field of \u201calgorithmic accountability,\u201d which seeks to make automated decisions more transparent, explainable and fair.  Her short TED Talk on coded bias has been viewed more than 940,000 times, and she founded the Algorithmic Justice League, a project to raise awareness of the issue.  In her newly published paper, which will be presented at a conference this month, Ms. Buolamwini studied the performance of three leading face recognition systems \u2014 by Microsoft, IBM and Megvii of China \u2014 by classifying how well they could guess the gender of people with different skin tones. These companies were selected because they offered gender classification features in their facial analysis software \u2014 and their code was publicly available for testing.

To test the commercial systems, Ms. Buolamwini built a data set of 1,270 faces, using faces of lawmakers from countries with a high percentage of women in office. The sources included three African nations with predominantly dark-skinned populations, and three Nordic countries with mainly light-skinned residents.  The African and Nordic faces were scored according to a six-point labeling system used by dermatologists to classify skin types. The medical classifications were determined to be more objective and precise than race.  Then, each company\u2019s software was tested on the curated data, crafted for gender balance and a range of skin tones. The results varied somewhat. Microsoft\u2019s error rate for darker-skinned women was 21 percent, while IBM\u2019s and Megvii\u2019s rates were nearly 35 percent. They all had error rates below 1 percent for light-skinned males.  Ms. Buolamwini shared the research results with each of the companies. IBM said in a statement to her that the company had steadily improved its facial analysis software and was \u201cdeeply committed\u201d to \u201cunbiased\u201d and \u201ctransparent\u201d services.

But the group had made it clear to the White House that it would not be pleased with any measure that had tariffs \u201cas the primary or even a significant remedy.\u201d  \u201cThe reason is that it would be a tax on consumers,\u201d Mr. Kallmer said, \u201cprecisely the people we are trying to support.\u201d  Many of the trade measures that Mr. Trump has proposed, including the steel and aluminum tariffs, have divided his advisers, the business community and the Republican Party. But the White House has boasted that its targeting of China\u2019s trade practices has broad support from industries on the losing end of the Chinese approach.  That theory could make it more difficult for American companies to operate in a country that already puts up steep barriers.  American companies and business groups have frequently complained that China blocks off valuable markets from American competition, including technology, media and finance, and that it does so in violation of commitments it made when it joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. China has imposed regulations that require American companies to share their technology with Chinese partners, for example, mandating that foreign companies operate through joint ventures if they want access to Chinese consumers. At times, the Chinese have resorted to stealing vital technologies through cyberwarfare, according to United States authorities.  Late last month, the White House said it would crack down on that behavior, outlining a series of actions aimed at punishing China for its trade barriers.  As Mr. Trump advances a series of tough trade measures to confront these behaviors, however, cracks have appeared in American industry\u2019s seemingly united front.

Any American company that wants to be a global player cannot afford to lose access to China\u2019s growing market, executives say.  Photo  Technology companies argue that the restrictive measures the administration is taking to help protect them could end up penalizing American manufacturing, raising costs and making their companies less competitive globally. And industries most vulnerable to retaliation, like agriculture, are protesting about losing valuable export opportunities. While the Chinese did not target soybeans in their initial tariffs list, many in the soybean industry worry they will be penalized in a trade dispute given China\u2019s importance as a market for exports.  The 25 percent tariff on pork that China imposed on Monday is expected to be particularly harmful, including in regions that supported the president, like Iowa, North Carolina and Indiana. Last year, American farmers sent more than a billion dollars\u2019 worth of pork to China, their largest export market by value after Japan and Mexico.  \u201cBecause we\u2019re so blessed to have America feed the world, we\u2019re also the first industry to get slammed whenever there are trade difficulties between the U.S. and other countries,\u201d Denise Bode, the coordinator for the American Fruit and Vegetable Processors and Growers Coalition.

These new tariffs are a drag on their ability to make ends meet.\u201d  Since Mr. Trump announced the China measures on March 22, American officials, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and the United States trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, have been in talks with the Chinese about ways to resolve their differences. The sides have discussed concessions like reducing China\u2019s tariffs on American cars, opening up its market for financial services and purchasing more semiconductors or natural gas, people familiar with the talks said.  However, analysts and companies involved in China said that these measures appeared unlikely to adequately resolve American concerns about China\u2019s longstanding encroachment on American intellectual property.  Companies are waiting anxiously for the administration to release a list of Chinese products this week that will be subject to tariffs \u2014 most likely the kind of high-tech products that the administration has accused China of targeting. The retail industry, which lobbied the administration and Congress against an early plan to impose tariffs on Chinese-made apparel and footwear, is now cautiously optimistic that its products will be exempt.  Restrictions on Chinese investment are expected to follow in the coming weeks. Administration officials have said those rules will aim to restore reciprocity with the Chinese, though it is not clear if the United States will go so far as to bar Chinese companies from investing in the same industries that China restricts. The White House is also considering the use of an emergency economy powers act that could allow it to restrict Chinese investments.

Last month, the committee stalled a hostile takeover of Qualcomm, a California-based chip maker, by a Singapore company, largely over concerns about ceding semiconductor prowess to China.  G.E. and IBM, which operate through joint ventures and other partnerships in China and around the world, have both lobbied against the expansion of Cfius over concerns that restrictions on joint ventures with foreign companies that include the transfer of valuable skills or technology could weaken the position of American companies abroad.  Financial firms, including Goldman Sachs and the Carlyle Group, have also expressed concern about investment restrictions, saying they could provide a drag on the United States economy.  White House advisers, in turn, have complained that previous approaches to dealing with China have not worked, and that companies are overreacting to legitimate trade measures.

The simple grading system used by restaurant regulators can and should be a model to inform the public about the digital security of businesses that store sensitive consumer data. A letter grade is a crude measure to assess a complex issue like cybersecurity to be sure, but what the metric lacks in nuance it makes up for with brute force.  Current measures to assess cyber-preparedness are either not compulsory or too complex. The federal government\u2019s National Institute of Standards and Technology framework is widely respected, but it\u2019s voluntary, underused and not easily digestible for the average consumer. Only seven Fortune 500 companies mentioned it in their annual filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission last year, and only one said it had adopted it.  MSCI \u2014 an index provider and independent research firm for institutional investors \u2014 ranks companies on cybersecurity. More than a year before Equifax\u2019s breach was revealed, MSCI scored Equifax a 0 out of 10 on privacy and data security. As prescient as it was, consumers would have had difficulty absorbing such a rating, which is just one of several components that MSCI uses to arrive at an environmental, social and governance, or E.S.G., rating of overall corporate citizenship.  A new grading system should start with the basics: Are companies on top of data security, and if hacked, do they know how to reduce the impact?  Each year, the Ponemon Institute, an independent research group, and IBM look at the cost of the average data security breach, as well as the average cost of each piece of data compromised. In 2017, the average cost of a data breach in the United States was $7.35 million, or $141 per record compromised. But if a company has an incident response team, uses encryption, trains its employees, has a business continuity program and monitors cyber-threat intelligence, that reduces the cost of the average data breach by nearly 47 percent. Using these five factors \u2014 weighed for their impact of cost reduction \u2014 is a simple starting point.  There are plenty of details to be worked out about a cybersecurity grading system. But the one nonnegotiable aspect would be that, once assigned, letter grades must be made highly accessible to the public. Companies should be required to display their grades prominently at their physical locations, on their websites, on certain documents (mortgage applications, for example) and on credit card readers.

Lattice said Cfius objected to the deal, and the company tried to appeal to the president, offering to resolve national security concerns. But Mr. Trump formally blocked the deal in September 2017, prompting China\u2019s commerce ministry to issue a statement saying countries should not push protectionism through security reviews. GO SCALE \u2014 PHILIPS In 2015, the Dutch electronics giant Philips had an agreement to sell a controlling stake in its automotive and LED business for as much as $2.9 billion to GO Scale, an investment fund sponsored by GSR Ventures of China and Oak Investment Partners. Philips canceled the deal after it could not resolve Cfius\u2019s concerns, and in December 2016 announced it would sell the unit to Apollo Global Management for $1.5 billion, almost half the amount of the earlier deal.  The Broadcom-Qualcomm deal does not involve China-based companies. But there has been concern that the acquisition could undermine the ability of the United States to compete with China in the race for telecommunications supremacy. Members of Cfius pointed to Broadcom\u2019s statements that it would take a \u201c\u2018private equity\u2019-style\u201d approach if it acquired Qualcomm, suggesting to the committee that Broadcom could reduce long-term investment on research and development in favor of focusing on short-term profits.  While the United States has remained a standard-bearer in mobile technology, the committee noted, \u201cChina would likely compete robustly to fill any void left by Qualcomm as a result of this hostile takeover.\u201d  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Lawmakers want to expand Cfius\u2019s jurisdiction  A bipartisan group in Congress has proposed legislation that would greatly expand the number of deals reviewed by Cfius. In November, Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, and Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, introduced a bill that could add thousands of companies with foreign ties to the list of those reviewed each year by Cfius and provide more funding to deal with that increase. A similar House bill was also introduced by Representative Robert Pittenger, Republican of North Carolina. The measure would expand Cfius\u2019s jurisdiction to include joint ventures, sales of minority stakes and real estate deals for property near military bases and other sensitive facilities.  \u201cBy exploiting gaps in the existing Cfius review process,\u201d said Mr. Cornyn, \u201cpotential adversaries, such as China, have been effectively degrading our country\u2019s military technological edge by acquiring, and otherwise investing in U.S. companies.\u201d  The proposal has drawn objections from some businesses.

But it is not the only risk. The new tariffs will inflict damage on the American economy even absent retaliation from abroad. If history is any guide, Mr. Trump is proposing to protect the homeland by shooting it in the foot.  The closest parallel is the moment in 2002 when President George W. Bush decided that, for the umpteenth time, domestic steel makers deserved a hand and imposed tariffs of 8 to 30 percent on a variety of steel products from many countries.  Imports from the affected countries plummeted, of course. But others \u2014 in steel categories not covered by the safeguard and from excluded countries protected by preferential deals \u2014 surged. Overall steel imports increased 3 percent over the next 12 months. Employment in the American steel industry kept declining. And according to one study, by the time the tariffs were lifted in 2003, higher steel prices had cost 200,000 jobs in steel-using companies, more than all the jobs in the steel industry itself.  Undeterred, President Barack Obama did roughly the same thing. After complaints about surging imports, he put tariffs on Chinese tires. Presumably nobody told him that American tire makers no longer produced the kind of low-grade tires exported by the Chinese. In any event, imports from other countries jumped 20 percent after the tariff was imposed. And the price of all imported tires rose by 18 percent, on average.  Gary Clyde Hufbauer and Sean Lowry at the Peterson Institute for International Economics calculated the additional cost to consumers at $1.1 billion \u2014 or about $900,000 per tire job saved. But the wages of workers whose jobs were saved amounted to about 5 percent of that.  The lesson is not that protectionism is porous. It is. And it can be gamed. Until a few years ago, Ford attached rear seats and rear windows to the Transit Connect vans it imported from its plant in Turkey. Once they had gone through customs \u2014 paying the 2.5 percent tariff on passenger vehicles instead of the heftier 25 percent levied on commercial vans \u2014 the seats and windows were ripped out and recycled.  The critical takeaway is that the distortions brought about by trade barriers impose a cost on the economy. It might not be easy to spot before the fact, but it tends to be more substantial than whatever fleeting gains protectionism can bring about to the protected.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Think of the multifiber agreement, which until its demise at the end of 2004 allowed the United States to impose individual quotas on thousands of pieces of apparel \u2014 cotton diapers from China, trousers from Guatemala. The rationale was to protect one of the lowest-wage industries in the country from lower wages in the developing world. A study by the United States International Trade Commission cited by the Dartmouth economist Douglas A. Irwin in his 2002 book, \u201cFree Trade Under Fire,\u201d concluded that it had raised apparel prices by 18 to 24 percent, imposing a particular burden on poor households.

A 63 percent tariff on advanced flat-panel screens for laptop computers in 1991 helped drive a stake through the heart of the American laptop industry itself. Japan\u2019s Toshiba stopped making laptops in the United States. Apple moved production to Ireland. An IBM spokesman called the decision \u201can eviction notice from the U.S. government to the fastest-growing part of the U.S. computer industry.\u201d  Similarly, the ring of protection around the sugar industry almost killed it instead. Hoping to protect a price floor for sugar of 16.75 cents a pound even as world prices sank, in the 1980s Washington resorted to increasingly stringent import quotas that drove domestic sugar prices up to five times the world average.  Clever Canadian firms sent sugary cake mixes to the United States \u2014 where the sugar was extracted. Other countries grabbed on to the tactic. In 1985, Washington put emergency quotas on all imports of sweetened cocoa, cake mixes and edible preparations. South Korean noodles \u2014 with 0.002 percent sugar content \u2014 were snagged in the dragnet. So was kosher pizza from Israel.  Then the unthinkable happened: Coke and Pepsi decided to replace expensive sugar with much cheaper high-fructose corn syrup. From 1980 to 1987, the share of sugar in American sweetener consumption, previously 65 percent, dropped to 47 percent.  \u201cIn the longer term, this market reaction to the sugar program may indeed threaten the economic viability of the entire sugar industry in the United States,\u201d the economist Anne O. Krueger noted in an analysis of the sugar supports.  Sugar quotas are still around, nonetheless. Candy makers including Hershey and Ferrara have moved factories offshore. In 2006, the International Trade Administration concluded that for each sugar growing and harvesting job saved between 1997 and 2002, three confectionary manufacturing jobs were lost.  Sugar quotas even undermined American policy to counter narcotics trafficking. The Central Intelligence Agency concluded that falling sugar exports encouraged farmers in Jamaica and Belize to switch to marijuana.  Mr. Trump might look back fondly at that long-ago chicken tax. In the 1980s, Detroit did everything it could to fend off Japanese automakers. It persuaded the Reagan administration to force the Japanese into \u201cvoluntary\u201d export restraints on cars \u2014 raising car prices for American consumers.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Nothing was as successful as the chicken wall. It eroded over time. S.U.V.s were ultimately allowed into the United States as cars. Japanese automakers started making monster pickups and S.U.V.s in the United States, too. Still, fewer than a quarter of cars sold in the United States are made in America. The share for light trucks is 54 percent.  But there was a cost: more expensive pickup trucks, for starters, not to mention the discarded seats and windows from Ford\u2019s Transit Connects. The tariff also successfully kept smaller, low-margin trucks from competing with the less-efficient models made at home. Alongside low gasoline prices and easy fuel-economy standards, Detroit\u2019s love affair with trucks arguably gave the United States the least fuel-efficient fleet in the industrial world.  If gasoline prices were to rise \u2014 say, in an effort to combat climate change \u2014 a gas-guzzling domestic auto industry could prove a weak link in the nation\u2019s security.", "stock": "IBM", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-13", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/13/business/economy/trade-chicken.html"}, {"article": "Experimental feature Listen to this article Play audio for this article Pause 00:00 00:00 Experimental feature Report a mispronounced word What was mispronounced?

As in sport, so in consulting, except in one important regard. Consulting, unlike the Olympics, is about the winning, not the taking part. So which is the best consultancy in the UK, based on the views of peers and clients?  For the UK\u2019s Leading Management Consultants 2018, Statista, the research and data provider, sorted recommendations into three categories. Six stars were awarded to firms \u201cvery frequently recommended\u201d in a consulting service or sector, five for \u201cfrequently recommended\u201d and four for \u201crecommended\u201d. Let us call these the gold, silver and bronze \u201cmedals\u201d in each \u201cevent\u201d. Deloitte, KPMG and McKinsey top the table by total number of medals \u2014 they each won star ratings in 29 sectors and services, the maximum.  This version of the table tells a familiar story: there is a gap between the largest, universal consultancies and the rest. Recommendations were made in at least 21 of the categories for the Big Four accountancy firms (Deloitte, KPMG, PwC and EY), the Big Three traditional strategy consultancies (McKinsey, Boston Consulting Group and Bain) and Accenture.  But this is only one way of arranging a medals table. At the 2016 Rio Olympics, for instance, Team GB won fewer medals overall than China, but beat China in the ranking by number of gold medals.  If one cuts the consulting medal tally in a similar way, it reveals a different picture: Accenture comes top. Despite gaining no medal ratings in two categories, it achieved 18 six-star ratings overall, against KPMG\u2019s 17, Deloitte\u2019s 12 and McKinsey\u2019s 11. This table also elevates IBM to equal fifth with PwC, for its nine \u201cgolds\u201d.  There is more to this than meets the eye. The Management Consultancies Association \u2014 a trade body whose members include Deloitte, KPMG and PwC \u2014 pointed out in its recent analysis of UK industry data that in 2016, the largest firms grew by 4 per cent on average. Medium-sized firms did better, growing by 6 per cent, and specialists\u2019 growth exceeded 20 per cent.  A similar story is told by our ranking. On overall medal tally, there is a notable gap between Bain (which garnered 21 six-, five- or four-star ratings) and the next highest groups, IBM (14) and AT Kearney and PA Consulting (13 each).  But the alternative view shows it is possible for specialists to win gold in single events. For example, Atkins Global topped the podium in the construction and infrastructure sector. OC&C was among the gold medallists in consumer goods and retail, and BAE destroyed all-comers in defence. Hay Group, part of Korn Ferry, the executive search firm, since 2015, wins gold in its specialist area of people and performance.  These companies join Oliver Wyman, Baringa and Simon-Kucher in a cluster of seven consultancies that won the top ranking in one sector or service. In this analysis of the ranking, they jump above AT Kearney and PA, which achieved no six-star ratings.  Some distinct subsidiaries of the biggest companies are winning recommendations, often by specialising, for example QuantumBlack, McKinsey\u2019s data analytics arm.  If anything, the ranking may overstate the importance of the bigger groups, whose balance sheets buy a lot of name recognition.  What an at-a-glance analysis of the table does suggest is that trying to be all things to all clients is probably futile unless you are one of the largest consultancies. On the other hand, a strategy of smart specialisation could pay off. After all, if you are a small nation that is home to the world\u2019s best weightlifters, why try to beat the USA in the track and field events?

Today many people rate plastic waste, particularly in the oceans, as a problem approaching climate change in its gravity.  Graphic images have raised public consciousness. Photographs have shown some of the world\u2019s most remote beaches that were pristine sand a decade or two ago now covered with plastic litter.  Films and television programmes such as David Attenborough\u2019s immensely popular Blue Planet II series have recorded heart-rending scenes of seabirds and marine creatures dying from plastics that they have mistakenly eaten or from debris entangled around their bodies.  People are also becoming alarmed by reading about the less visible but more pernicious problem of microplastics with dimensions measured in fractions of a millimetre. These come from various sources including the disintegration of larger plastic items, microbeads added to health and beauty products, and microfibres separating from clothing and fabrics during cleaning and laundry. The tiny particles and fibres are ingested by marine wildlife, with adverse consequences that environmental toxicologists are just beginning to investigate.  As the clamour to \u201cdo something\u201d rises in volume, politicians are responding with pledges to increase recycling and to reduce unnecessary plastic packaging. At the same time, research funds are starting to move into the field, prompting scientists and engineers to come up with ideas to tackle the problem, both by finding ways to remove existing waste from the oceans and, more importantly, to stem the flow of new plastics into the environment.  Professor Mariana Mazzucato of University College London proposed that Europe\u2019s next Framework research programme should adopt \u201ca plastic-free ocean\u201d as one of its grand challenges.  \u201cThis mission could have clear target to reduce the amount of plastic entering the marine environment by 90 per cent, and of collecting more than half of the plastic currently present in our oceans, seas and coastal areas,\u201d she says in a paper commissioned by EU science and innovation commissioner Carlos Moedas.  This would mean stopping at least 7.2m tonnes of plastic entering the marine environment and collecting at least 2m tonnes of plastic per annum, the paper adds, concluding that \u201ca very ambitious yet achievable timeline to reach this target would be circa five to 10 years\u201d.  Such a comprehensive attempt to tackle the crisis will require basic and applied research, as well as entrepreneurial innovation. The greatest technological challenge will be removing plastics from the oceans, through nets and booms moving across the sea surface which would gather up and remove or destroy rubbish \u2014 all without harming ocean life. The first targets might be the ocean gyres, circulating currents where plastics accumulate, of which the most notorious has become known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.  The Ocean Cleanup, a Dutch foundation that is planning to launch a clean-up operation there later this year, estimated in a study carried out from boats and aircraft and published this month that the Patch contains 1.8tn pieces of plastic weighing a total of 80,000 tonnes, covering 1.6m sq km of the North Pacific between California and Hawaii.  \u201cThese results provide us with the key data to develop and test our technology,\u201d says Boyan Slat, founder of Ocean Cleanup. \u201cSince the results indicate that the amount of hazardous microplastics is set to increase more than tenfold if left to fragment, the time to start is now.\u201d  The clean-up system is itself made of durable plastic. \u201cIt\u2019s quite poetic, like using fire to extinguish fire,\u201d says Mr Slat.  Floating screens extend 3m deep into the sea, suspended from ultra-strong U-shaped tubes 1km long and held in place by a drogue or sea anchor. As ocean currents flow past the screens they collect plastic debris, which can be collected every couple of months by ships for recycling or incineration.  If this year\u2019s trial of the first system goes well, Mr Slat hopes that as many as 60 collectors will be operating in the early 2020s, removing about half of the plastic from the Great Pacific Garbage Patch within five years.  Stopping plastics getting into the oceans in the first place will require a huge change in consumer behaviour and product design \u2014 fuelled by a global commitment by governments and business to phase out non-essential single-use plastics, particularly for packaging, and make it easier to recycle remaining plastic waste.  Such a circular economy will require plastic products to have a simple design, in which the different components are easily separated and the polymers from which they are made are clearly identifiable. At present the sorting machinery in recycling plants faces a confusing variety of materials mixed \u2014 or, worse, bonded \u2014 together.  Polymer chemists will also need to come up with new ways to recycle plastics that are elusive under current technology. A recent paper in the journal Science by Jeannette Garcia of IBM Almaden research centre in California and Megan Robertson of the University of Houston concluded that only two types of polymer are routinely recycled today: PET and polyethylenes, representing just 9 per cent and 37 per cent respectively of plastic production.  Researchers are already developing cost-effective new chemical recycling technologies for other plastics such as polystyrene. Such efforts, the authors say, \u201craise hope that before long recycling rates for plastics will be much higher than today\u201d.", "stock": "IBM", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-29", "source": "financial-times", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/0f3627ec-db6e-11e7-9504-59efdb70e12f"}, {"article": "Experimental feature Listen to this article Play audio for this article Pause 00:00 00:00 Experimental feature Report a mispronounced word What was mispronounced?

Our behaviour is changing as a result of an information and communications overload, both at work and in our personal lives. Finding a way to manage the barrage is an important challenge as the information economy develops.  Distractions at work, such as the constant inflow of emails, notifications and pop-up chats, take their toll. One study, by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University, found that the mere prospect of being distracted by a ringing mobile phone reduced test participants\u2019 cognition skills, measured by a test involving reading a passage of text and being asked questions about it.  Our addiction to smartphones and social media is also making us more fidgety. One study of Android users by research company Dscout found that people tapped, swiped and clicked their smartphones 2,617 times a day. Apple\u2019s products are sufficiently addictive to prompt activist investors to demand research be done into the negative impacts of phone use on children. There is growing concern about a mental health crisis in young people caused by the addictiveness of social media, the internet, and gaming.  When you get bored you ignite the \u2018default mode\u2019 in your brain, and this is where we do our most original thinking  \u201cThere is nothing new about the existence of an attention economy that monetises our eyeballs,\u201d says Cal Newport, associate professor of computer science at Georgetown University and author of Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World. \u201cBut when you combine this business model with powerful handheld devices that are always connected to the internet, algorithms being weaponized to extract as much of our time and attention as possible, and hundreds of billions of dollars of investment, suddenly the societal impacts become worrisome.\u201d  Prof Newport is worried about the next generation. \u201cIt is almost certainly true that young people are suffering a rapid decline in their ability to concentrate. Given the increasing share of the economy dedicated to knowledge work, in which concentrated thought is the primary driver of value production, this decline might start to impact large scale economic metrics, if it hasn\u2019t already\u201d.  Overcoming overload is hard, because we are addicted to information \u2014 or, more specifically, to novelty  If information overload stops us concentrating deeply, it also stops us resting deeply \u2014 and that is just as damaging. Boredom, zoning out and absent-mindedness are all fertile mental states for creativity. \u201cWe\u2019re at an interesting moment in neuroscience in terms of understanding how boredom is a gateway to mind-wandering,\u201d says Manoush Zomorodi, host of the WNYC podcast Note to Self and author of Bored and Brilliant.  \u201cWhen you get bored, say you are folding laundry, or doing something that doesn\u2019t require focused attention, you ignite the \u2018default mode\u2019 in your brain, and this is where we do our most original thinking,\u201d she says. \u201cWe take two seemingly disparate ideas and smash them together to make something new. And we do autobiographical planning. We look back at our life, take note of highs and lows, create personal narratives, and look at our future and decide where we want to go.\u201d  If in a quiet moment we instead check for emails or social media updates, then we may be in danger of losing the experience of boredom entirely.  Overcoming overload is hard, because we are addicted to information \u2014 or, more specifically, to novelty. This was helpful in the hunter-gatherer era, because it could lead us to food and resources. It is less helpful online, where we cannot ever be satiated. Companies are tapping this foraging-related brain circuitry to make products more addictive. One gamification firm, with clients including Disney and Google, even named itself Dopamine, after the brain chemical.  Some of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest names are raising the alarm, from Facebook\u2019s founding president Sean Parker to former Google design ethicist Tristan Harris.  Is there a solution?  \u00a9 EPA  Yet there are glimmers of hope. Consumers, and even investors, are paying more attention to the problem. Facebook published a study confirming that its users do indeed feel worse after \u2018passively\u2019 consuming social media. It argued however that social media increased wellbeing when people used them actively, especially when \u201csharing messages, posts and comments with close friends and reminiscing about past interactions\u201d. It recently announced changes to its news feed, to prioritise the sharing of meaningful content between friends.  At work, companies are deploying software, artificial intelligence and machine learning to bring order and structure to the informational chaos that many office workers now feel. Slack can reduce email overload by shifting high-volume, open-ended communications into chat forums. IBM Verse and SalesforceIQ sift information and prioritise actions for staff. Google has rolled out auto-reply suggestions on Gmail, with algorithms proposing possible replies to messages, and tools like Evernote consolidate scattered online and offline notes, links and resources.  Then there are the apps and internet blockers which forcibly disconnect people from certain sites, or during certain times, including Thrive App, from Arianna Huffington\u2019s wellbeing consultancy and Samsung.  The power of the humble notebook  Meanwhile Prof Newport, who gained tenure at the young age of 33 without working in the evenings or at weekends, says the humble notebook is his tool of choice. His reasons are subtle, relating to the ways in which the finitude of three dimensional space shapes our thinking. \u201cWhen scheduling your day in a notebook, the fact that the page is a fixed size embodies the reality that your time and attention are limited commodities. Days scheduled on paper tend to be more realistic and balanced than those driven [by] a bottomless inbox or voluminous digital task list.\u201d  Research also shows that writing on paper fires up the brain circuitry associated with language processing and engenders more attentive reading. All of which might give us reason to pause before rolling out the tablets, laptops and digital education for an already screen-sapped generation.

Conceived in collaboration with the science-fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke, \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey\u201d was way over budget, and Hollywood rumor held that MGM had essentially bet the studio on the project.  The film\u2019s previews were an unmitigated disaster. Its story line encompassed an exceptional temporal sweep, starting with the initial contact between pre-human ape-men and an omnipotent alien civilization and then vaulting forward to later encounters between Homo sapiens and the elusive aliens, represented throughout by the film\u2019s iconic metallic-black monolith. Although featuring visual effects of unprecedented realism and power, Kubrick\u2019s panoramic journey into space and time made few concessions to viewer understanding. The film was essentially a nonverbal experience. Its first words came only a good half-hour in.  Audience walkouts numbered well over 200 at the New York premiere on April 3, 1968, and the next day\u2019s reviews were almost uniformly negative. Writing in the Village Voice, Andrew Sarris called the movie \u201ca thoroughly uninteresting failure and the most damning demonstration yet of Stanley Kubrick\u2019s inability to tell a story coherently and with a consistent point of view.\u201d And yet that afternoon, a long line\u2014comprised predominantly of younger people\u2014extended down Broadway, awaiting the first matinee.  Stung by the initial reactions and under great pressure from MGM, Kubrick soon cut almost 20 minutes from the film. Although \u201c2001\u201d remained willfully opaque and open to interpretation, the trims removed redundancies, and the film spoke more clearly. Critics began to come around. In her review for the Boston Globe, Marjorie Adams, who had seen the shortened version, called it \u201cthe world\u2019s most extraordinary film. Nothing like it has ever been shown in Boston before, or for that matter, anywhere. The film is as exciting as the discovery of a new dimension in life.\u201d  \u2018Stanley and I are laughing all the way to the bank.\u2019  Although incomprehensible by prevailing Hollywood standards, Kubrick\u2019s cryptic, mostly dialogue-free structure fit well with the radical avant-garde artistic innovations of the period, and the movie was an immediate countercultural hit. John Lennon quipped, \u201c\u20182001\u2019? I see it every week,\u201d and David Bowie was inspired to record his hit single \u201cSpace Oddity\u201d just under a year later\u2014a clear allusion to the film. \u201c2001\u201d became a genuine late-\u201960s cultural happening and a bellwether of the decade\u2019s generational divide. With ticket sales brisk from day one, the production ended up the highest-grossing film of 1968. \u201cAs for the dwindling minority who still don\u2019t like it, that\u2019s their problem, not ours,\u201d Clarke wrote. \u201cStanley and I are laughing all the way to the bank.\u201d  Fifty years later, \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey\u201d is widely recognized as ranking among the most influential movies ever made. The most respected poll of such things, conducted every decade by the British Film Institute\u2019s Sight & Sound magazine, asks the world\u2019s leading directors and critics to name the 100 greatest films of all time. The last BFI decadal survey, conducted in 2012, placed it at No. 2 among directors and No. 6 among critics. Not bad for a film that critic Pauline Kael had waited a contemptuous 10 months before dismissing as \u201ctrash masquerading as art\u201d in the pages of Harper\u2019s.  Although the film\u2019s vision of humanity expanding throughout the solar system proved overoptimistic, its portrait of a screen-based, technology-mediated future now seems almost uncannily accurate, and it devastatingly evokes the dehumanization that can result from such communication. As for the cyclopean HAL-9000 supercomputer, often considered the most human character in \u201c2001,\u201d it foreshadowed our anxious contemporary discussion about the potentially dystopian impact of artificial-intelligence technologies.  The film\u2019s extraordinary predictive realism was entirely premeditated, the result of Kubrick and Clarke\u2019s questing, cerebral commitment to scientific and technical accuracy. By all accounts the production was run less like a big-budget Hollywood production than an extended futurological R&D exercise. A broad slate of top aerospace and computer companies were brought on board as consultants and advisers, with such leading innovators as IBM , Bell Labs and Hewlett-Packard all playing important roles.  In the summer of 1965, Kubrick received two detailed Bell Labs reports written by A. Michael Noll (a trailblazer in the development of digital arts and 3-D animation) and information theorist John R. Pierce (who coined the term \u201ctransistor\u201d and headed the team that built the first communications satellite). They recommended that the spacecraft systems in \u201c2001\u201d all feature multiple \u201cfairly large, flat and rectangular\u201d screens, with \u201cno indication of the massive depth of equipment behind them.\u201d Flat screens were, of course, unknown in the \u201960s\u2014at least outside of movie theaters\u2014and they helped to ensure 2001\u2019s futuristic sheen.  The film featured forward-looking flat-screen tablet computers. Photo: Mary Evans/Everett Collection  The role of the film\u2019s sentient supercomputer, originally named Athena, grew throughout the film\u2019s development, under the influence of discussions that Kubrick and Clarke held with MIT cognitive scientist and artificial intelligence pioneer Marvin Minsky and British cryptologist and mathematician I. J. Good. The computer\u2019s physical look resulted from advice provided by IBM\u2019s influential design bureau-think-tank\u2014the Apple Industrial Design Group of its day\u2014then led by industrial designer Eliot Noyes.  In July 1965, Noyes and his team provided drawings of astronauts floating within a kind of \u201cbrain room\u201d\u2014a concept that Kubrick initially rejected but later recognized as having intriguing dramatic possibilities. The astronaut Dave Bowman\u2019s methodical lobotomization of the computer after it\u2014or rather, \u201che\u201d\u2014had killed off the rest of the crew, conducted within the dappled red confines of the film\u2019s remarkable brain-room set, remains one of the most powerfully disturbing scenes ever committed to celluloid.  HAL stood for \u201cHeuristic Algorithmic,\u201d a Minsky suggestion. The computer\u2019s homicidal tendencies emerged only gradually, forcing the production to remove its original IBM nameplate and to substitute another acronym\u2014a kind of subliminal cognate, with \u201cHAL\u201d being displaced from \u201cIBM\u201d by only one letter in each case, something that both Kubrick and Clarke strenuously denied was intentional.  Another fascinating result of the production\u2019s consultation with Big Blue was the film\u2019s forward-looking flat-screen tablet computers, which retained their IBM logos and were called \u201cNewspads.\u201d Constructed long before such technologies were feasible, the movie\u2019s seemingly portable Newspads were actually welded to the tables on which they appeared casually placed, with hidden 16mm film projectors recessed underneath to provide content for their frosted-glass displays.  In the film\u2019s final cut, the Newspads were only used by the astronauts to watch a TV program ostensibly from the BBC and were thus largely indistinguishable from the various other displays embedded in the sets. But the production had received permission from the New York Times to use its logo, and Kubrick\u2019s designers had mocked up a digital front page for the Newspads, complete with multiple story choices to be accessed by touch-screen command. If the page had been used, the movie would almost certainly now be seen as having predicted the internet.  More than four decades later, however, the predictive futurism of \u201c2001\u201d was decisively ratified when Apple released its first iPad in 2010. Samsung issued a similar device a year later, and Apple immediately sued for patent infringement. That August the Korean company filed a response in federal court in San Jose, Calif., asserting that Apple couldn\u2019t possibly have invented the iPad because the device had already been envisioned in \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey.\u201d  Samsung\u2019s unusual defense, which featured both stills and YouTube links from the film, was ultimately ruled inadmissible as evidence, but it confirmed what many fans have long appreciated: the continuing relevance and still-startling prescience of Kubrick\u2019s masterpiece.  \u2014Mr. Benson is the author of \u201cSpace Odyssey: Stanley Kubrick, Arthur Clarke and the Making of a Masterpiece,\u201d which will be published on April 3 by Simon & Schuster.", "stock": "IBM", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-09", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-kubricks-2001-a-space-odyssey-saw-into-the-future-1520609361"}, {"article": "Shipping giant A.P.

The companies, which began collaborating on the new technology in 2016, said the new company\u2019s platform could be used to streamline operations for the entire global shipping ecosystem. Large companies such as DowDuPont Inc. already have piloted the platform.  The idea came from the current stack of paperwork needed to process and track the shipping of goods. Maersk said the maximum cost of the required trade documentation to process and administer many of the goods shipped each year is estimated to reach one-fifth of the actual physical transportation costs.

More corporations, including General Motors Co. and Procter & Gamble Co. , have expressed interest in the platform and are exploring ways to use it to streamline supply chains and customs clearance. Singaporean and Peruvian customs also are exploring collaborating with the platform to facilitate trade flows and enhance supply chain security.  The move comes as Maersk and IBM have been attempting to reinvent themselves. IBM, the 106-year-old technology giant, has been looking to new lines of business including blockchain as sales in its legacy business of selling hardware and software slow. Maersk has been trying to transform itself to into a global supply-chain major like United Parcel Service Inc. and FedEx Corp. by integrating its transport and logistics units and spinning off its oil business.  The new company will be headquartered in the New York metropolitan area and led by former president of Maersk Line in North America Michael White.  Solutions from the joint venture are expected to become available within six months of regulatory clearance.

International Business Machines reported Thursday that fourth-quarter revenue rose nearly 4% year over year. Even adjusting for a boost from favorable currency rates, Big Blue\u2019s top line managed its first period of growth in nearly six years. Strong sales of systems hardware business along with IBM\u2019s growing cloud-computing service contributed to the uplift.  Still, IBM\u2019s shares fell Friday, much like they have done following 10 of its last 12 quarterly reports. A bit of growth, as it turns out, isn\u2019t quite enough to assuage concerns about how the company gets there. Fourth-quarter gross margins slipped below the 50% line for the first time in five years for what is typically the company\u2019s strongest seasonal period. And, while IBM did project annual revenue growth for 2018, it is unclear if the company can do that without continued help from favorable exchange rates.  Given that IBM\u2019s stock had jumped more than 15% since its last quarterly report, some disappointment was bound to set in. The company also expects a slight drop in free cash flow in 2018 due to increased capital spending in key segments to drive future growth. IBM did manage to close 2017 with a small gain in adjusted per-share earnings of $13.80 after three years of declines. But the company also projected flat earnings for 2018, given its need to invest more in its business.  Those investments have borne some fruit.

Robert Pittenger\u2019s \u201cHow China Pushes the Limits on Military Technology Transfer\u201d (op-ed, March 14): Few Americans would argue against measures to make this country more secure, and most would agree that protecting national security requires the proper tools. Still, many more would agree that being factual when discussing this topic is absolutely critical.  Legislation recently introduced in Congress and advocated in these pages by Rep. Robert Pittenger would make some needed improvements to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (Cfius). For example, the measure would expand the ability of the government to block the purchase of buildings or other real estate near military installations.  But Mr. Pittenger\u2019s bill\u2014the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act\u2014goes much, much farther. It would drastically expand the mission of Cfius, an interagency committee staffed by fewer than a dozen people at the Treasury Department, bringing under government review countless international sales and licensing transactions by U.S. companies.  The new remit of Cfius would include such things as standard computer service and support contracts, technology manuals needed to operate machinery purchased by foreign customers and even the licensing of trademarks. Technologies that never were deemed sensitive by the Defense Department or that were long ago removed from control by the U.S. and its allies would be subject to new and opaque regulation by Cfius.  More concerning is that Mr. Pittenger\u2019s bill would do all of this unilaterally\u2014without any effort at cooperation with our allies. The U.S. does not have a monopoly on innovative technologies. Congress can impose all the restrictions it wants on U.S. businesses. But, if America does not work with allies to enact similar controls, we will fail to protect both national security and our economic competitiveness.  In making his case to expand Cfius, Rep. Pittenger has misrepresented the facts. He cites examples of technology sold overseas by IBM and other companies that the U.S. government itself long ago ruled were nonsensitive and able to be freely sold around the world without a government license. In fact, everything IBM has done globally complies with U.S. and foreign export-control laws. For instance, sharing widely published, open-source software, or technology to assemble computer servers that are years behind state of the art, isn\u2019t threatening and therefore not legally controlled for export. But assisting with China\u2019s high-performance computing project is rightly prohibited by U.S. law, and the assertion that IBM has done so is flatly untrue.  Instead of putting thousands of nonsensitive transactions under review by a small committee that has neither the staff nor the experience to handle them, the better approach would be to update the export-control system we already have. A bipartisan bill introduced by Reps. Ed Royce and Eliot Engel, leaders of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, would modernize export controls to deal with emerging challenges.  Congress could also require that technology controls be kept up-to-date. The Departments of Commerce and State\u2014which are today responsible for administering controls on dual-use and military technologies\u2014have between them 500 experts, a transparent process of licensing and deep technical knowledge. But the Militarily Critical Technologies List, mandated by Congress as the baseline for what to control, hasn\u2019t been updated by the Defense Department since 2011.  As recent history has shown, controlling sensitive technology works best when done internationally, with a sharp focus on those technologies that are the most critical. Casting too broad a net on routine business risks losing focus on the real threats. Creating a new bureaucracy, instead of modernizing the one we already have, would be misguided.  Rep. Pittenger should get his facts straight. And Congress should act, both to improve Cfius and to update export controls, but it should use the proper tools for the proper job.  Christopher Padilla  IBM  Washington  Mr. Padilla is vice president for government and regulatory affairs at IBM. He was assistant secretary of commerce responsible for export controls from 2006-2007.  Rep. Pittenger\u2019s piece is premised on inaccurate claims about GE that undermine his arguments to reform government oversight of foreign acquisitions. We are a 125-year-old American company that has worked closely with the U.S. government and military for decades. Rep. Pettinger\u2019s insinuation that GE would compromise our national security to do business in China is offensive and untrue. While we, like many global companies, have joint ventures in China, all of them are consistent with U.S. law, and in many instances were established in close consultation with the U.S. government.  Rep. Pittenger never contacted GE to fact-check his allegations. In truth, GE supports Cfius reform, including strengthening the federal resources devoted to reviews of inbound investments and focusing the review on sectors of highest priority. What we don\u2019t support is the expansion of Cfius\u2019s jurisdiction to outbound U.S. investments into joint ventures around the world (not just in China). Doing so would set back both U.S. national security and economic interests, creating a new bureaucracy that is completely redundant with the existing U.S. export control system. It would generate thousands of additional cases for an already underresourced Cfius system, reduce the likelihood of a coordinated approach with our closest allies and needlessly damage American companies and their workers seeking to compete abroad.  Unfounded attacks like those made by Rep. Pittenger are unhelpful to the complex challenge the U.S. faces in safeguarding sensitive U.S. technology while enabling companies to compete in global markets.

Fourth-quarter revenue rose 3.6% to $22.54 billion. The last time IBM had revenue growth from the prior year was the first quarter of 2012, Ms. Rometty\u2019s first as chief.  Several factors drove growth in the latest quarter: sales of industrial-strength computers\u2014which the company typically refreshes every few years\u2014 rose 32% to $3.33 billion, while cloud-computing revenue climbed 30% to $5.5 billion. Also, currency exchange rates have been working in IBM\u2019s favor lately, accounting for 3 percentage points of the quarter\u2019s revenue growth after years of being a headwind.  IBM said it took a $5.5 billion charge related to the new U.S. tax law, helping to push it into the red for the period. Its tax rate, excluding the charge but including certain one-time benefits, was 6%.  In all, the company reported a fourth-quarter loss of $1.05 billion, or $1.14 a share, compared with profit of $4.5 billion, or $4.72 a share, a year earlier.  The loss stemmed partly from a deep erosion in profits in IBM\u2019s services business, showing IBM still has work to do. Pretax profit margins in the two services segments that manage large companies\u2019 software and hardware needs sank 35% and 23%, respectively, from a year ago. In its conference call with analysts, IBM described high investments and \u201clarge contract dynamics\u201d in those businesses.  Since becoming CEO, Ms. Rometty has struggled to shift IBM from older, shrinking businesses, such as selling and maintaining equipment in customers\u2019 own facilities, to newer ones that promise rapid growth.  She has staked out a position in helping large corporate customers integrate their traditional operations with cloud computing, and has focused on buzzy areas such as artificial intelligence and the Internet-based ledger technology known as blockchain.  But growth has been elusive, as even high-profile initiatives\u2014such as IBM\u2019s Watson AI, a collection of cloud tools as well as apps for industries including medicine and finance\u2014haven\u2019t delivered a clear financial boost.  Even some of Ms. Rometty\u2019s biggest fans have lost patience. IBM\u2019s largest and arguably most prominent stakeholder\u2014Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which invested more than $10 billion for a 5.4% stake in 2011\u2014sold more than half its holdings last year. Berkshire held about 37 million shares as of Sept. 30.  Shares of the 106-year-old tech company dropped 3.1% in after-hours trading after finishing Thursday\u2019s regular session with a marginal gain at $169.12. The price stands roughly where it did a year ago, while the S&P 500 index has risen more than 23%.  While achieving quarterly growth is noteworthy, IBM is working toward what it sees as a more significant milestone: getting more than half its revenue from so-called strategic imperatives \u2014 mostly newer technologies such as AI that customers can access in the cloud.  Revenue from strategic imperatives made up 49% of the total in the quarter, edging toward the point at which sales of the higher-growth offerings will outweigh the rest of IBM, heralding faster growth overall.  In an interview, James Kavanaugh, IBM\u2019s new finance chief, said the company is \u201cahead of track\u201d in working toward its goal of hitting an annual revenue rate of $40 billion for strategic imperatives by the end of this year.  \u201cThat gives us the confidence to say we\u2019re going to grow revenue overall in 2018,\u201d he said.  Jim Lebenthal, a portfolio manager at HPM Partners LLC, said there is evidence of Ms. Rometty\u2019s progress. He shed IBM in 2015 after \u201ca lot of disappointments\u201d but recently added the company to his stable of 20 stocks. He is betting IBM\u2019s newfound revenue growth is sustainable and that strategic imperatives will grow to more than 50% of sales in 2018.  When Ms. Rometty took the CEO reins from Samuel Palmisano in January 2012, revenue started slipping almost immediately and the threat of cloud computing to IBM\u2019s traditional businesses became evident. Ms. Rometty purchased cloud-computing platform SoftLayer Technologies Inc. the following year and committed to developing Watson into a flagship offering.  By 2014, it was clear IBM had diverged from Mr. Palmisano\u2019s financial road map for $20-a-share in profit by 2015. Ms. Rometty set aside that goal, reorganized the company around her strategic imperatives and redirected about $4 billion away from stock repurchases toward priorities such as Watson and the cloud, according to UBS AG analyst Steven Milunovich.  IBM\u2019s challenges now include holding on to its large customers as cloud leaders such as Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google beckon.  \u201cStrategic imperative revenue may cross over the core franchises later this year,\u201d Mr. Milunovich said, \u201cbut there are a lot of industry trends working against a large incumbent like IBM.\u201d  Hardware revenue rose 32%, driven by sales of mainframe computers\u2014on IBM\u2019s conference call with analysts, former finance chief Martin Schroeter called mainframes \u201can enduring and growing franchise\u201d\u2014which accounted for nearly 15% of total revenue in the quarter.  Those sales are critical, as they drive related sales of support services, software, storage and financing that historically have made up roughly 40% of IBM\u2019s operating profit, according to analyst Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein Research. They also can cement long-term customer relationships that drive recurring revenue such as software subscriptions, he said.  On an adjusted basis, which omits such items as acquisition- and retirement-related charges, IBM had profit of $5.18 a share, a penny more than the $5.17 expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters.  The Armonk, N.Y., company\u2019s guidance for 2018 called for operating earnings of $13.80 a share and free cash flow of about $12 billion.

IBM -0.86% is scheduled to announce fourth-quarter earnings after the market closes Thursday. Here\u2019s what to look for:  EARNINGS FORECAST: Analysts expect IBM to report earnings of $5.17 a share on an adjusted basis, which typically omits items such as acquisition- and retirement-related charges, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters. A year ago, IBM reported $5.01 in adjusted profit.  REVENUE FORECAST: Analysts expect total revenue of $22.05 billion for the quarter, up 1.3% from $21.77 billion a year earlier\u2014what would be the first growth after 22 consecutive quarters of declines.  WHAT TO WATCH:  GROWTH, BUT FOR HOW LONG?: One quarter of growth after more than five years of declines doesn\u2019t make a trend, some analysts caution. Fourth-quarter revenue was bolstered by two key factors, they say. First, foreign-exchange rates lately have shifted in IBM\u2019s favor after years of cutting into financial performance. They likely accounted for roughly 3% of revenue in the quarter, said Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein Research. Second, Q4 was the first full period that included sales of IBM\u2019s latest industrial-strength computers that process transactions for retailers, banks and the like. The mainframes, which IBM typically introduces every few years, typically boost revenue across several business lines. That effect is cyclical and bound to taper after a few quarters, Mr. Sacconaghi said.  SERVICES AHEAD: Knowing an eventual drop-off in mainframe revenue is down the line, investors will be looking for other areas to pick up the slack. IBM\u2019s two services segments, which include its consulting, IT hardware and software services and cloud operations, typically account for roughly 65% of total revenue. Both declined in recent quarters. \u201cFor IBM to get to revenue stability, which is what really matters for the stock multiple, services have to improve,\u201d said David Grossman of Stifel Financial Corp.  TAX IMPACT: Analysts are struggling to evaluate precisely how the U.S. tax-reform bill recently passed by Congress will affect IBM. The company has said its aggregate tax rate is around 15%, plus or minus 3 percentage points, but some analysts believe the new law may push it as high as 20%. The company held around $71 billion in cash overseas at the end of 2016, said Steve Milunovich of UBS AG , and repatriating some of that money could eat into earnings. IBM hasn\u2019t yet said what it expects to do with its stockpile in light of the new U.S. tax law.

The Senate and House, with the backing of the White House, are working on bipartisan legislation to broaden the authority of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., a multi-agency body that has oversight of deals that could lead to the transfer of sensitive technology to rival countries. The current CFIUS statute doesn\u2019t single out any country, but in recent years, the committee has often been focused on deals involving China.  Currently, CFIUS can recommend the president block foreign entities from buying majority stakes in U.S. companies; the new bill would let the committee make similar recommendations for deals involving minority investments and joint ventures, along with transactions that it determines involve \u201cemerging technologies.\u201d  The scope of the proposed legislation is broad. China requires foreign investors to form ventures with local partners, and Washington law firms say they are receiving a surge in inquiries over what it might mean for the large number of U.S. firms active in China. The country\u2019s huge size has made it a market of interest for companies ranging from auto makers like General Motors Corp. , technology companies like Cisco Systems Inc. or other manufacturers like Caterpillar Inc. \u2014all of which have local ventures in China.  It isn\u2019t clear how broadly the new law would be enforced. For now, the most vocal corporate opponents are a handful of U.S. companies that have determined the new law might crimp business prospects by requiring companies to get the blessing of CFIUS for some joint ventures that involve shared U.S. technology.  IBM Corp. , for instance, last year agreed with China\u2019s Wanda Internet Technology to share the cloud computing technology used in its Watson artificial intelligence system. Behind the strategy is the belief that embedding IBM\u2019s technology in China\u2019s business infrastructure would steer Chinese customers toward IBM as they seek future growth.  Other large U.S. corporations, from General Electric Co. to Microsoft Corp. , see China as a crucial market for similar reasons.  IBM, among others, has said the bill\u2014known as the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act\u2014would hurt U.S. companies\u2019 ability to compete globally. \u201cForeign competitors that do not face similar regulatory restrictions will seize global market opportunities while American companies are left watching from the sidelines,\u201d IBM\u2019s vice president of government and regulatory affairs, Christopher Padilla, testified at a recent Senate hearing.  Supporters of the bill, who think it could be signed into law later this year, aren\u2019t convinced. \u201cI am concerned that some of the recent witnesses before the House and Senate have major financial conflicts of interest that prohibit an objective evaluation of the security threats we face,\u201d Rep. Robert Pittenger (R., N.C.)\u2014one of the drafters of the bill\u2014said in an email.  \u201cThe business models for IBM, Microsoft, and GE, for example, have led to the transfer of military applicable technologies to China that have likely aided the modernization of the Chinese military and intelligence agencies,\u201d said Mr. Pittenger. The bill\u2019s supporters say it complements and strengthens export regulations rather than duplicating them.  IBM and other opponents, while acknowledging national-security concerns, have suggested existing export controls to counter China rather than expanding the reach of CFIUS. IBM didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.  In an email, GE said while it supports the idea of changes to CFIUS, \u201cit\u2019s also important that any reform support America\u2019s historical leadership in attracting foreign investment, not duplicate existing and well-established export control regimes, and preserve the ability of American companies to compete globally.\u201d The company declined an interview. Microsoft declined to comment.  Several security experts say China has been sidestepping controls by taking minority stakes in U.S. technology companies or entering joint licensing ventures.  \u201cThere\u2019s a very sophisticated and well-organized plan [by China] to acquire the technology and the reality is there are people here who want to sell it,\u201d said William Reinsch, who was the Commerce Department\u2019s undersecretary for export administration under President Bill Clinton.  And for many who have watched China easily avail itself of gaps in the CFIUS review process, the bill is the minimum that can be done in a fight that is likely to get much bigger. CFIUS blocked 10 deals between 2014 and 2016 over national-security concerns; China in recent years has accounted for the largest number of reviewed transactions.  \u201cThere\u2019s a big trade war shootout coming up with China that I think, frankly, is overdue,\u201d said Adm. Dennis Blair, co-chair of the Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property and a former U.S. director of national intelligence. He said among the key technologies right now are those involving artificial intelligence, data mining and pattern recognition.

Tianjin Haiguang didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.  AMD spokesman Drew Prairie said in an email that \u201csome commentators have mischaracterized\u201d the venture and that AMD received a \u201cU.S. government classification confirming that the technology was not restricted for export\u201d\u2014a reference to Commerce Department export controls. As for the CFIUS overhaul bill, Mr. Prairie said AMD supports strengthened security but wants to make sure it doesn\u2019t have \u201cunintended consequences.\u201d Dawning Information Industry Co. , the largest shareholder of Tianjin Haiguang, didn\u2019t respond to an email.  Many businesses are also supportive of the bill, including software maker Oracle Corp. , telecommunications firm Ericsson Inc., steelmaker Nucor Corp. and railroad-car-equipment maker Greenbrier Co s. Many say an expanded CFIUS would set needed ground rules for working with Chinese firms.  Even openly supporting the bill, some companies worry, could expose them to problems\u2014not in the U.S. but in China. They don\u2019t want to be blocked from entering deals in China, or prevented from selling products in its booming economy.  \u201cWe\u2019re quiet about our support because of fear of retaliation,\u201d said an executive at a large U.S. technology company.  \u2014Kersten Zhang and Ted Greenwald contributed to this article.

One employee planning to depart\u2014a 47-year-old who has been with the car maker for a decade\u2014said Peugeot is offering him \u20ac10,500 ($12,950) to retrain. He wants to become a teacher.  \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten to a point where the company is no longer right for me, and I\u2019m no longer right for the company,\u201d he said. \u201cBetter a good divorce than a bad marriage.\u201d  Mr. Macron\u2019s approach could backfire, however, if companies use the new measures to cut staff without hiring new ones. France\u2019s economy is finally in recovery, with latest figures showing unemployment at the end of 2017 at 8.9%, its lowest level since early 2009. But Mr. Macron remains under pressure to bring that rate down further, and the country\u2019s powerful unions have their guard up against any evidence that the rules could cost jobs rather than create them.  Foreign businesses that have typically viewed France as a sinkhole for investment are also watching closely. Labor lawyers in Paris are already fielding calls from firms in the U.S. and elsewhere that \u201care interested in the possibility of moving fast in a consensual framework that isn\u2019t traumatic for their teams,\u201d said Claire Toumieux, a partner at law firm Allen & Overy.  IBM, based in Armonk, New York, plans to \u201chire aggressively in key skills areas\u201d in France in parallel to conducting layoffs using the new rules, a company spokeswoman said.  In September, Mr. Macron decreed myriad changes, including capping court-ordered fines for dismissals and giving companies greater powers to negotiate working conditions with employees. One part of the broad package is a measure that absolves companies from using lengthy, complex procedures for voluntary layoffs.  A broken window at a Paris branch of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale after a march in November against the French government\u2019s overhaul of labor laws. Photo: Michel Stoupak/NurPhoto/ZUMA Press  Previously a firm had to prove it was in financial difficulty before embarking on layoffs, even on a voluntary basis. Publicly traded firms were loath to declare they were struggling. Penalties for missteps in the procedure were high, and a company could ultimately be forced to hire back staff who left.  The new rules allow employers to instead negotiate a rupture conventionnelle collective\u2014a voluntary severance agreement for large numbers of employees\u2014regardless of the company\u2019s health.  \u201cIt\u2019s a complete change in philosophy,\u201d said David Jonin, a partner specializing in employment law at Gide Loyrette Nouel.  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale plans to use the measure to restructure its retail operations. As customers shift to online services, the bank is scrambling to close 300 of its 2,000 retail branches in France and automate 80% of the processes linking front and back offices. The plan, dubbed \u201cTransform to Grow,\u201d will entail 3,450 job cuts from its retail network between 2016 and 2020, the bank said in November.  Many of those cuts were expected to take place through attrition or the redeployment of staff to other units of the bank, but last month the bank disclosed it would also make use of the new rules.  Balancing Act Peugeot is using President Macron's labor measures to slash jobs this year and soften the blow with new recruits. 3,000 Apprentices 2,000 2,000 1,000 New hires  1,300  0  Layoffs  \u20131,000  1,300  Early  retirement  \u20132,000  900  \u20133,000  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale has scheduled talks with unions for later this month. Under the Macron law, any firm that wants to adopt the new scheme needs to win over a majority of its union representatives. In some cases that has emerged as a significant obstacle.  \u201cManagement is going too fast. When you want to get rid of so many jobs, you\u2019ve got to explain why,\u201d said Monique Motsch, a representative of the moderate CFDT union at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.  At French clothing retailer Pimkie, unions already shot down a Jan. 9 proposal to apply the new process, forcing the company to revert to France\u2019s older, more onerous system requiring the firm to show itself as being in financial distress.  Peugeot, in contrast, secured the support of its unions in a matter of days. The car maker threaded the needle by sweetening the layoff offers and combining them with 900 early-retirement offers and a plan to recruit and train higher-skilled employees. That includes 1,300 new positions and 2,000 apprentices.  \u201cPsychologically it\u2019s softer. There\u2019s no obligation to leave, everything is voluntary and it protects workers who want to stay,\u201d said Jean-Francois Kondratiuk, an employee representative who sits on Peugeot\u2019s supervisory board.  Workers who choose to stay at Peugeot are accepting more flexibility. Jean-Louis Thirot, 50, has agreed to train for a new job testing software for car electronics. The research center in the west of Paris where he currently works ordering parts is shutting down this year.  \u201cI\u2019m able to succeed because I can move internally,\u201d said Mr. Thirot, who has worked for Peugeot for more than three decades.  Others say they have recognized that a job at Peugeot is no longer the safe bet it once was. A 40-year-old technician whose father, brother and wife have all worked for the car maker said he thought he had a job for life when he joined the company in 2003. Now that Peugeot has outsourced nearly all of his department\u2019s work, he has decided to take the severance package.  \u201cI\u2019m the last of the Mohicans,\u201d he said.

Robert Pittenger\u2019s \u201cHow China Pushes the Limits on Military Technology Transfer\u201d (WSJ.com op-ed, March 14): Few Americans would argue against measures to make this country more secure, and most would agree that protecting national security requires the proper tools. Still, many more would agree that being factual when discussing this topic is absolutely critical.  Legislation recently introduced in Congress and advocated in these pages by Rep. Robert Pittenger would make some needed improvements to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (Cfius). For example, the measure would expand the ability of the government to block the purchase of buildings or other real estate near military installations.  But Mr. Pittenger\u2019s bill\u2014the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act\u2014goes much, much farther. It would drastically expand the mission of Cfius, an interagency committee staffed by fewer than a dozen people at the Treasury Department, bringing under government review countless international sales and licensing transactions by U.S. companies.  The new remit of Cfius would include such things as standard computer service and support contracts, technology manuals needed to operate machinery purchased by foreign customers and even the licensing of trademarks. Technologies that never were deemed sensitive by the Defense Department or that were long ago removed from control by the U.S. and its allies would be subject to new and opaque regulation by Cfius.  More concerning is that Mr. Pittenger\u2019s bill would do all of this unilaterally\u2014without any effort at cooperation with our allies. The U.S. does not have a monopoly on innovative technologies. Congress can impose all the restrictions it wants on U.S. businesses. But, if America does not work with allies to enact similar controls, we will fail to protect both national security and our economic competitiveness.  In making his case to expand Cfius, Rep. Pittenger has misrepresented the facts. He cites examples of technology sold overseas by IBM and other companies that the U.S. government itself long ago ruled were nonsensitive and able to be freely sold around the world without a government license. In fact, everything IBM has done globally complies with U.S. and foreign export-control laws. For instance, sharing widely published, open-source software, or technology to assemble computer servers that are years behind state of the art, isn\u2019t threatening and therefore not legally controlled for export. But assisting with China\u2019s high-performance computing project is rightly prohibited by U.S. law, and the assertion that IBM has done so is flatly untrue.  Instead of putting thousands of nonsensitive transactions under review by a small committee that has neither the staff nor the experience to handle them, the better approach would be to update the export-control system we already have. A bipartisan bill introduced by Reps. Ed Royce and Eliot Engel, leaders of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, would modernize export controls to deal with emerging challenges.  Congress could also require that technology controls be kept up-to-date. The Departments of Commerce and State\u2014which are today responsible for administering controls on dual-use and military technologies\u2014have between them 500 experts, a transparent process of licensing and deep technical knowledge. But the Militarily Critical Technologies List, mandated by Congress as the baseline for what to control, hasn\u2019t been updated by the Defense Department since 2011.  As recent history has shown, controlling sensitive technology works best when done internationally, with a sharp focus on those technologies that are the most critical. Casting too broad a net on routine business risks losing focus on the real threats. Creating a new bureaucracy, instead of modernizing the one we already have, would be misguided.  Rep. Pittenger should get his facts straight. And Congress should act, both to improve Cfius and to update export controls, but it should use the proper tools for the proper job.

One of the most important such lenses is the impact of IT on business processes, that is, on how work is actually done across the various functions of an organization.  IT-driven business process has gone through three distinct phases. First came process automation in the early years of IT, where companies automated and improved their existing processes while leaving the underlying structure of the organization in place. Then came enterprise-wide process reengineering and management, where the job was to redesign the flow of work and integrate management of the various process within the enterprise. The third phase is now starting, focused on the processes and transactions that determine how institutions interact with each other around the world. Here, blockchain is set to play a role.  Automation, reengineering and integrated management of business processes have had a major impact on lowering the costs and improving the efficiency of transactions within a firm. But as we well know, the internet and globalization have significantly increased the volume of transactions and other interactions taking place among institutions around the world. The processes to manage the conduct of business among companies have not kept up with the economy\u2019s digital transformation, adding significant frictions and costs to their operations.  According to a 2016 IBM report, three major types of frictions predominate when conducting business among different institutions:  Information frictions: Participants in a transaction don\u2019t have access to the same information; the required information is not easily accessible; and security and privacy risks keep rising, \u2013 e.g., hacking, cybercrime, identity theft.  Interaction frictions: Intermediaries are needed to help deal with growing scale and complexity; transactions take longer due to arcane global processes; and a lack of trusted marketplaces in many economies around the world.  Innovation frictions: These include legacy systems, bureaucratic processes and institutional inertia; restrictive regulations that stifle innovation and change; and growing uncertainties and threats that make it harder to move forward.  Blockchains have the potential to significantly reduce these various frictions by bringing one of the most important and oldest concepts, the ledger, to the internet age. Ledgers constitute a permanent record of all the economic transactions an institution handles, whether it\u2019s a bank managing deposits, loans and payments; a brokerage house keeping track of stocks and bonds; a global company conducting business with its supply chain partners; or a government office recording births and deaths, the ownership and sale of land and houses, or legal identity documents like passports and driver licenses.  \u201cToday, transactions are recorded in multiple ledgers,\u201d noted the IBM report. \u201cEach one captures at best a moment in time and reflects the information held by a single party: Bank X purchased or sold a mortgage, for example. They don\u2019t record what happens next, what came before, or the role of others \u2013 partners, suppliers, consumers \u2013 in the transaction. Moreover, they\u2019re prone to human error and vulnerable to tampering. By contrast, distributed ledgers can be shared and updated in near real-time across a group of participants.\u201d  Blockchain technologies hold great promise for global supply chains ecosystems by increasing the speed, security and accuracy of financial and commercial settlements; tracking the supply chain lifecycle of any component or product; and securely protecting all the transactions and data moving through the supply chain. Blockchains provide an immutable, non-revocable record of all the transactions through the entire supply chain cycle, which will be of great help in the timely resolution of errors or disputes among supply chain partners.  In August, 2016 the World Economic Forum published an excellent report on The future of financial infrastructure, an ambitious look at how blockchain can reshape financial services. The report noted that blockchain technologies have the potential to transform the infrastructure and processes of the financial industry, bringing a diverse range of benefits including operational simplification, near-real time settlements among institutions, more accurate regulatory compliance and liquidity and capital improvements.  However, the report also warned that the evolution towards such a blockchain-based financial infrastructure and processes will take considerable time because it must overcome significant challenges. In particular, it will require the close collaborations of its various stakeholders around the world \u2014 including financial institutions, merchants and governments\u2013to develop the appropriate legal and regulatory frameworks.  This emerging third phase in the evolution of business process transformation is both promising and challenging, as we once more apply IT to make economies more efficient, this time involving the interactions of institutions and industries all around the world.

Photo: Akos Stiller/Bloomberg News  Nvidia NVDA -1.32% may have only high-quality problems these days, but it still needs to solve them.  One problem the chip maker has is that it seems to be selling all the chips it can make. Nvidia\u2019s graphics processors, also called GPUs, are in hot demand by everyone from giant tech companies building data centers to videogamers to cryptocurrency enthusiasts. The latter two in particular are competing for the type of GPU cards used in supercharged PCs, causing a shortage that began last summer but seemed to have worsened later in the year as the value of cryptocurrencies continued to soar.  That gave a boost to what was already a strong year for Nvidia. Revenue from the company\u2019s gaming segment jumped 33% to a record $5.5 billion for the fiscal year ended Jan. 28. This included an unspecified contribution from crypto demand, as well as the chips the company sells to Nintendo that are used in its popular Switch console. Nvidia is a \u201cfabless\u201d chip company that outsources the actual manufacturing of its chips to others. CEO Jensen Huang said on the company\u2019s earnings call Thursday that it is working with its partners to \u201ccatch up to that demand.\u201d The recently ended fiscal year was the company\u2019s best ever. Sales jumped 41% to a record $9.7 billion, while operating income surged 66% to $3.2 billion\u2014another record. The company\u2019s operating margin for the year was also at a record high 33%, compared with 28% the previous year. Data center sales, representing chips sold to companies such as Google, Amazon and Microsoft to establish artificial intelligence capabilities in their networks, more than doubled during the year. That means Nvidia\u2019s main \u201cproblem\u201d for the year ahead is how to improve on perfection. Chances are that it can. Capital spending on data centers is expected to continue growing in the double-digit range this year. Gaming demand will remain strong as well, particularly with Nintendo boosting production of the Switch. Crypto is a wild card, with the value of those currencies swinging wildly of late, but Nvidia is wisely cautious about those customers, maintaining its focus on its gamer base and the burgeoning data center opportunity. Still, the company has a lot to live up to. Its stock defied Friday\u2019s turbulence to pick up 7% after already having surged nearly 90% in the previous 12 months. Nvidia\u2019s market value is now ahead of that of IBM \u2019s , with the shares fetching 37 times forward earnings. High expectations can set up disappointments down the road. Still, there are worse problems to have.

IBM is one of the big tech companies exploring ethical standards to guide the development of artificial intelligence. Photo: brian snyder/Reuters  WASHINGTON\u2014Technology companies are racing to get ahead of regulators to shape the future of artificial intelligence as it moves deeper into our daily lives.  Companies are already working artificial intelligence, or AI, into their business models, but the technology remains controversial. So IBM Corp. , Intel Corp. and associations representing Apple Inc., Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google unit are seeking to set ethical standards, or a sort of code of conduct, through alliances with futurists, civil-rights activists and social scientists.  Critics, however, see it as an effort to blunt outside regulation by cities, states or the federal government, and they question if tech companies are best suited to shape the rules of the road. For the corporations, the algorithms will be proprietary tools to assess your loan-worthiness, your job application, and your risk of stroke. Many balk at the costs of developing systems that not only learn to make decisions, but that also explain those decisions to outsiders.  When New York City proposed a law in August requiring that companies publish source code for algorithms used by city agencies, tech firms pushed back, saying they needed to protect proprietary algorithms. The city passed a scaled-back version in December without the source-code requirement.  \u201cThey\u2019re hiding behind trade secrets so you can\u2019t even get a look at what people are doing,\u201d said Ryan Calo, a University of Washington law professor who has advised Congress members on AI issues.  AI, broadly speaking, refers to computers mimicking intelligent behavior, crunching big data to make judgments on anything from avoiding car accidents to where the next crime might happen.  Yet computer algorithms aren\u2019t always clear on their logic. If a computer consistently denies a loan to members of a certain sex or race, is that discrimination? Will regulators have the right to examine the algorithm that made the decision? What if the algorithm doesn\u2019t know how to explain itself?  From the Archives Executives from Baidu, Intel, Samsung and Walmart talk about how artificial intelligence will soon redefine our technological lives. They speak at the WSJ D.Live conference in Laguna Beach, Calif. (Originally published Oct. 18, 2017)  The Obama administration sought to address these issues. Under Mr. Obama, the Office of Science and Technology Policy issued white papers on the ethical implications on AI. Under Mr. Trump, the office still doesn\u2019t have a director, and its staff is down to about 45, from about 130. A spokesman for the office declined to comment.  For now, the Trump administration has signaled it wants business to take the lead. The administration is worried overarching regulation could constrain innovation and make the U.S. less competitive, Michael Kratsios, the deputy in charge of tech policy at the Office of Science and Technology Policy, said at a conference in February. He noted China\u2019s push into artificial intelligence, which it is doing without much ethical quibbling.  \u201cWe\u2019re not looking for, or will be endorsing, broad, high level guidelines about AI rules,\u201d Mr. Kratsios said. He called it \u201ckey\u201d to create \u201cthe regulatory environment that ensures that the next great technologies happen here in the U.S.\u201d  In the past six months, Intel, IBM, Workday Inc. and the Washington, D.C.-based Information Technology Industry Council\u2014whose members include Facebook, Apple and Google\u2014all issued principles on the ethical use of artificial intelligence. In January, Microsoft Corp. put out an entire book on \u201cArtificial Intelligence and its Role in Society.\u201d  In 2016, some of the biggest tech companies founded an ethics-setting organization called the Partnership on Artificial Intelligence to Benefit People and Society, based in San Francisco. There are many others with at least some industry funding, including Open AI, the AI Now Institute, doteveryone, and the Center for Democracy & Technology.  Proposed rules have ranged from specific guidelines for government use, to requirements that any algorithm be able to explain its process to consumers. Many would apply existing regulations to AI case-by-case, adapting aviation rules to drones or applying privacy protections to personal data in algorithms.  Setting rules is complicated because companies often can\u2019t explain how their more complex systems, called \u201cdeep neural networks,\u201d arrive at answers. Last year, University of Washington researchers reported that an algorithm that had learned\u2014by itself\u2014to distinguish between wolves and husky dogs appeared to be doing so by noticing snow on the ground in the wolf pictures, not because of any insight into the animal.  \u201cGoogle, Facebook, those guys are very interested in performance and making these programs as smart as they can,\u201d said Dave Gunning, who leads a project into making algorithms explain their processes for the government\u2019s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.  \u201cExplainability is not as important to them,\u201d Mr. Gunning said. Google and Facebook didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.  At least one business executive, Elon Musk, founder and chief executive of Tesla Inc. and SpaceX, has cut back his role in the ethical research group he co-founded, Open AI. Mr. Musk quit the group\u2019s board in February. The group said he wanted to \u201celiminate a potential future conflict of interest\u201d with his role at Tesla, which is developing AI systems. He remains an Open AI adviser and funder.  Some in Congress are taking up the ethical debate. Washington Sen. Maria Cantwell and Maryland Rep. John Delaney, both Democrats, led a bipartisan bill introduced in December to establish a federal advisory council on the technology\u2019s potential impact. There is also an AI caucus on the Hill, started in may, and committees have been holding hearings on AI, algorithms and autonomous vehicles. The European Union has already set regulations for AI algorithms, that are set to take effect in May.  Human-resources software maker Workday, which uses Ai algorithms, assumes that either now, or sometime soon, the U.S. will start to set guidelines.  \u201cOur engagement now is in anticipation that one day there will be government regulation related to AI,\u201d said senior vice president Jim Shaughnessy. He said Workday wants to \u201censure a regulatory framework that serves society\u2019s needs while allowing the potential of AI, and its benefits, to flourish.\u201d", "stock": "IBM", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-13", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/artificial-intelligence-rules-more-of-your-life-who-rules-ai-1520933401"}, {"article": "Humanoid robots are getting better at walking, talking and looking like humans.

Oxford Economics, a forecasting and consulting firm, estimates the legislation will contribute 0.4 percentage points to already-robust economic growth in 2018, and another 0.1 to 0.2 points in 2019, said Gregory Daco, head of U.S. economics for the consultancy.  About half of that is likely to come from business spending, and the rest from households, Mr. Daco said. Oxford estimates that each $1 of corporate tax cut will lead to 40 cents of spending, based on historical precedent, Congressional Budget Office studies and conversations with corporate executives.  That\u2019s mostly a one-time gain. A reduction in taxes frees up profits to spend, but that then becomes the new normal, with further growth coming from general economic expansion or other factors.  At Amicus Therapeutics, the new tax law solved a geographic dilemma. The Cranbury, N.J., company is developing an experimental drug to treat Pompe disease, a rare inherited disorder that causes muscle weakness and can be fatal.  After early results for a new drug proved promising, Amicus wanted to increase production for further clinical testing and potential commercial sales.  Amicus, which has been using Chinese contract manufacturer WuXi Biologics to supply the drug, decided in August to build its own facility. The U.S. was at a disadvantage to Europe, due to its 35% statutory federal income-tax rate for companies. Ireland\u2019s corporate tax rate, by contrast, is 12.5%.  Those financial considerations threatened to overshadow other advantages that a U.S. plant would offer, including the ease with which company officials could visit it, and the availability of talented workers in some regions.  \u201cOur strong assumption was that it would be very challenging to establish a new bio-manufacturing facility in the U.S.,\u201d Chief Executive John Crowley said in an interview.  As the tax legislation advanced in Congress last fall, however, building in the U.S. began to look more attractive. On Dec. 21, a day after Congress passed the final measure, which lowered the statutory corporate rate to 21%, Mr. Crowley recommended to his board the company focus on finding a U.S. site. The company has narrowed its choice to three East Coast cities Mr. Crowley declined to identify, and expects to decide in the next month or two. It expects the plant to cost $150 million to $200 million, and to employ at least 200 people at an average pay of $100,000 a year.  Amicus Therapeutics Chief Executive John Crowley, right, chose the U.S. over Europe for a new production facility. Photo: Melissa Golden for The Wall Street Journal  \u201cWith the changes in the tax law, it now makes the U.S. competitive with these geographies we\u2019re looking at,\u201d he said.  The rules of deal making, too, are changing. In the past two months, Aramark completed two acquisitions with a price tag of $2.35 billion as it snapped up hotel procurement and supply firm Avendra in December and uniform-rental and linen-supply firm AmeriPride Services Inc. last week.  Both are a kind of deal that, thanks to the new tax law, has become cheaper. One provision lets companies deduct the cost of buying some sorts of assets immediately, instead of over several years as prior tax law required\u2014and expanded this treatment to used assets as well as new ones.  That essentially lets a buyer like Aramark get an immediate discount on the cash cost of part of its deals, the portion that reflects the acquisition of equipment, machinery and other tangible property.  Aramark\u2019s acquisition of Avendra, a partnership, is automatically treated as an asset purchase, New York tax consultant Robert Willens notes, while deal documents indicate Aramark and AmeriPride agreed to treat that acquisition as an asset purchase as well for tax purposes. (Although the Avendra deal closed in December, the new tax treatment applies to assets acquired after late September.)  \u201cThe cost of deals structured in this manner have taken a turn for the better,\u201d Mr. Willens said. \u201cYou\u2019re getting a full 21% discount.\u201d  In news releases, Aramark described its after-tax cost for the two deals as $1.86 billion, 21% less than the pretax price. Aramark said in a statement that it continues to evaluate the impact of the new tax law with accounting firm KPMG LLP, and plans to update investors on the acquisitions when it reports quarterly earnings on Feb. 6.  The same provision, speeding up tax deductions for capital spending, has prompted Kimberly-Clark, the diaper- and tissue-maker, to accelerate at least one major project, CEO Tom Falk said. The company\u2019s board votes next month on a U.S. factory retooling expected to cost hundreds of millions of dollars. There wasn\u2019t a timeline for the project previously.  \u201cIt gives us more incentive to invest, particularly in the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Falk said in an interview. \u201cThe project made sense before the tax benefit. It makes more sense after the tax benefit.\u201d  Similar reconsiderations are under way elsewhere. At United Natural Foods Inc., a grocery distributor with about 10,000 employees and more than $9 billion in annual revenue, the tax law has prompted a wholesale re-evaluation.  Projects previously viewed as risky are being given new consideration, Mike Zechmeister, the company\u2019s finance chief, said in an interview. The return on investment improved by 4 percentage points on a warehousing project in the Pacific region of the U.S. that the company had already decided to pursue, he said, primarily because of the new lower tax rate.  \u201cIt\u2019s going to impact all the decisions we make,\u201d Mr. Zechmeister said. \u201cAlmost all investments look better from an investment standpoint because we won\u2019t have to pay as much tax.\u201d  Grocery distributor United Natural Foods Inc. is investing to overcome capacity bottlenecks. Photo: United Natural Foods  The tax break comes at a particularly good time for United Natural Foods, which has struggled to keep pace with surging demand for natural and organic goods. The company\u2019s net sales rose 8% year-over-year during its last quarter to $2.5 billion, driven largely by Whole Foods, the chain acquired by Amazon.com Inc . last year and United Natural\u2019s biggest customer.  That sudden growth proved costly. The Providence, R.I., company had an additional $25 million in lost sales from out-of-stock goods during its last quarter, along with higher labor costs and storage fees. Any expansion would help ease capacity bottlenecks that the company intends to resolve in coming months.  Some companies are holding pat, either because they want to see how the new rules shake out, or because they are worried about moving too fast.  Verizon said it would use most of its tax savings\u2014$3.5 billion to $4 billion in extra cash in 2018\u2014to pay down some of its $117 billion debt, rather than increase investments. It will also donate to its charity and give employees company stock.  Mr. McAdam, the Verizon CEO, said the wireless giant would remain disciplined about capital spending. \u201cIt\u2019s very inconsistent that just because tax reform comes through, we are all of a sudden going to draw the line at a different place or lose that discipline,\u201d he said on Tuesday.  Several firms have announced plans to plow most of their tax savings into dividends or share repurchases, about a third of which flow to foreign investors, by some estimates.  Bank of America Corp. is exploring how it might invest in branches, technology and its workforce, CEO Brian Moynihan told investors last week. \u201cHowever, to be clear, we\u2019d expect most of the benefits from tax reform will flow to the bottom line through dividends and share buybacks over time,\u201d he added. A spokesman said payouts to shareholders will also help local economies.  The tax overhaul is altering corporate operations in sometimes surprising ways. Netflix Inc., for example, has changed the compensation it will pay three of its top officers, raising their salaries by a combined $19 million.  Its reasoning: The new tax law prevents companies from deducting any sort of pay over $1 million apiece for key executives. Prior law allowed companies to deduct that pay if it was tied to performance. So, having lost the benefit of a tax deduction for paying performance-based bonuses instead of salary, Netflix announced days after the tax law was passed that its board was scrapping the performance measures and converting the pay into straight salary instead, as it used to do before 2014.  The tax-law change is likely to eliminate tax deductions on $92 billion of pay, according to an analysis of Russell 3000 firms by Equilar. Several large companies\u2014including Johnson Controls International PLC and drugmaker AmerisourceBergen Corp. \u2014have said their boards are considering how the tax change affects their approach to compensation. Willis Towers Watson , a compensation-consulting firm, found that 40% of 333 employers it surveyed were either considering executive-pay changes or had already made some.  The ripple effects are hitting small businesses, too. Matthew Wells, president of Western Mechanical Contractors Inc. in Federal Way, Wash., is considering whether to restructure how his business is organized to maximize his benefits under the new tax law.  The 32-person plumbing and mechanical contracting firm is currently set up as an S corporation, a so-called pass-through structure in which the business itself isn\u2019t taxed and its income goes to the owners, who reflect it on their individual tax returns.  Mr. Wells is trying to determine whether his tax bill would fall if he switched to a C corporation, which pays its own income taxes directly to the Internal Revenue Service\u2014now at a 21% rate, down from a top rate of 35% before the new law.  Mr. Wells\u2019 accountant is still poring over the new law, but has suggested the potential benefits may not be as great as the contractor initially believed. \u201cI think they are going to try and talk us out of it,\u201d said Mr. Wells. \u201cBut it is certainly something we are looking into.\u201d  Christmas may be over but WSJ\u2019s Richard Rubin keeps the holiday spirit alive by explaining who\u2019s getting presents and who\u2019s getting coal with the GOP tax bill.  \u2014Sharon Terlep, Ruth Simon and Ryan Knutson contributed to this article.

Blockchain has the power to transform all these industries for three reasons. First, it\u2019s genuinely well-suited to transactions that require trust and a permanent record. Second, blockchain typically requires the cooperation of many different parties. In cases where it\u2019s implemented as open source software, it avoids the collective-action problem\u2014the disincentives that prevent individuals from adopting something that would benefit them collectively\u2014that occurs when a single company tries to push, and benefit from, a new standard.  The third reason is that hype I mentioned. The current excitement around cryptocurrency gives blockchain the visibility to attract developers and encourage adoption. Companies that have taken an \u201cIf it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it\u201d attitude toward back-office processes and logistics IT might be ready to spend big on updating those systems when they hear the buzzword \u201cblockchain.\u201d  In this way, blockchain resembles another buzzword, \u201cthe cloud.\u201d While detractors argued that the cloud was just \u201csomeone else\u2019s computer,\u201d it gave many industries new business processes, new ways to charge for services, disruptive startups and new divisions within existing companies and an ecosystem of supporting technologies. Blockchain has the same potential.  Blockchain All the Things  Take logistics. Already, 1.1 million items sold or on sale at Walmart are on a blockchain\u2014including chicken and almond milk\u2014helping the company trace their journey from manufacturer to store shelf. Global shipping giant Maersk uses the same technology from IBM to track shipping containers, making it faster and easier to transfer them and get them through customs.  While these projects are still a fraction of the overall tracking that goes on at these giants, they are expanding rapidly both within the organizations and across their industries. Other companies using blockchain technology to track goods include Kroger, Nestl\u00e9, Tyson Foods and Unilever, with many more yet to be announced, says Bridget van Kralingen, senior vice president of platforms and blockchain at IBM.  Everledger, a company started in April 2014 with the intention of creating a blockchain-based registry of every certified diamond in the world, already has 2.2 million diamonds in its registry. It\u2019s adding about 100,000 diamonds a month, says Leanne Kemp, chief executive and founder.  Related Blockchain May Offer a R\u00e9sum\u00e9 You Can Trust  By recording 40 different measures of each stone, including \u201cphysically unclone-able features,\u201d Everledger is able to trace the journey of a stone from when it\u2019s pulled from the earth to the day it\u2019s purchased by a consumer. Every participant in that chain, from the miner to the cutter to the retailer, maintains a node\u2014with a complete copy of the database\u2014in the Everledger blockchain network.  Global shipping giant Maersk uses blockchain technology from IBM to track and transfer shipping containers and move them more quickly through customs. Photo: Susana Gonzalez/Bloomberg  CartaSense is an eight-year-old Tel Aviv company that puts internet-connected sensors on freight pallets and uses analytics to determine when goods may be delayed or damaged. CartaSense customers, rather than physically handing off scanned and signed paper documents, use a blockchain database on which freight companies can record every stage of the journey of a package, pallet or shipping container. Kuehne + Nagel, one of the world\u2019s largest freight companies, is one of CartaSense\u2019s clients.  Replacing Regulations With Code  Blockchain is being implemented first within companies and centralized governments that can move quickly on new technologies.  Dubai, for example, has declared its intent to make itself the \u201cfirst blockchain-powered government in the world by 2020.\u201d That could streamline things in real estate, says Stephen McKeon, an associate professor of finance at the University of Oregon who studies blockchain. By moving the central record of all real-estate transactions onto a blockchain, Dubai could make it faster and easier to transfer property titles.  Because such \u201csmart contracts\u201d on a blockchain are code, they can contain rules about how they can be modified or transferred. In this way, blockchain could become a way to transfer the obligation of enforcement from bureaucrats to computers. For example, to prevent fraud, titles could be transferable only to certain accounts, or might transfer only after another condition, such as the transfer of funds in escrow, is met.  Dubai has vowed to become the \u2018first blockchain-powered government in the world by 2020.\u2019 Photo: Rustam Azmi/Getty Images  It\u2019s too early to say whether blockchain, as both a technology and a movement, has the power to overcome issues that thwarted generations of software engineers. The most justifiable skepticism is that blockchain is incremental rather than revolutionary. In some cases, it isn\u2019t much more than a marketing term imposed on systems that hardly differ from existing databases. (There\u2019s a healthy debate about what blockchain even means, and even companies like CartaSense call their system a \u201cblockchain-like technology.\u201d)  But if it works, it has the potential to be a fundamental enabling technology, the way new standards for transmitting data across networks led to the internet. More concretely, it could someday underlie everything from how we vote to who we connect with online to what we buy.

AT&T is among the last large telecom companies looking to unload its platform of data centers. Photo: stephanie keith/Reuters  AT&T Inc. T -0.06% has reignited a sales process for its data-center business.  The telecom company has engaged Bank of America Corp. to explore a divestiture of its data centers, said people familiar with the matter.  The data-center business generates about $135 million of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, the people said. They said they expect the unit to garner an Ebitda multiple in the high-single-digit range\u2014roughly $1 billion or more\u2014based on the quality of the facilities.  AT&T previously had weighed a sale of its data-center and managed-hosting businesses with Citigroup Inc., some of the people said. Ultimately, it sold only the hosting business, which IBM Corp. purchased in 2015.  The Dallas wireless carrier is among the last large telecom companies looking to unload its platform of data centers\u2014facilities equipped with networked computers, storage devices and servers. Last year, Verizon Communications Inc. sold its portfolio of data centers to Equinix Inc. for $3.6 billion, while that same year CenturyLink Inc. sold its facilities for $2.3 billion to a consortium led by private-equity firm BC Partners. In 2015, Windstream Holdings Inc. divested its data-center business to TierPoint for $575 million.  AT&T is looking to sell the capital-intensive data centers to better focus on its core wireless and video businesses. The process is still ongoing, however, and may not result in a deal. The facilities will require investment and attention from prospective acquirers, said some of the people familiar with the business.  Shedding the data centers could give AT&T extra cash to pay down the cost of acquiring Time Warner Inc., if that deal materializes. The company offered $85 billion in cash and stock for the owner of HBO, CNN and other media assets before the federal government challenged the deal on antitrust grounds. A trial to decide the proposed merger\u2019s fate is slated to begin March 19.  AT&T is selling its data facilities as strong appetite from both cash-rich strategic buyers and new entrants like infrastructure firms, are driving up prices for such assets. The sector continues to expand rapidly as organizations consume larger amounts of data and outsource more information-technology services.  Private-equity firms, in particular, have played a big role in consolidating the data-center industry, drawn to its expansion trajectory and a contracts-driven business model that promises steady cash flow. Over the past decade, investors have successfully built platforms that today are part of bigger conglomerates.  Recent transactions in the sector include Iron Mountain Inc.\u2019s acquisition of IO Data Centers LLC for $1.34 billion, private equity-backed Peak 10 Inc.\u2019s acquisition of ViaWest Inc. for 2.3 billion Canadian dollars and Digital Realty Trust Inc.\u2019s purchase of DuPont Fabros Technology Inc. for $4.95 billion.  \u2014Drew FitzGerald contributed to this article.

The East African country, an important player on the continent in the U.S. war on terror, has been mired in political uncertainty after two fraught elections and bursts of violence.  In a news conference, President Uhuru Kenyatta and opposition leader Raila Odinga \u2014who has refused to concede the vote\u2014promised dialogue, and said they would soon roll out a specific path to reconciliation.  \u201cWe shall bring a process of bringing of our people together, and find out what really divides our nation,\u201d Mr. Kenyatta said. \u201cWe must bring together all our people where no single person is left behind.\u201d  Mr. Tillerson\u2019s arrival, after stops in Ethiopia and Djibouti, reflects Kenya\u2019s role as a top ally in combating al-Shabaab, the al Qaeda affiliate in Somalia. Nairobi is also home to regional headquarters to some major U.S. corporations like IBM , Google and Coca-Cola .  Mr. Tillerson congratulated the two men in a news conference in Nairobi later Friday, and he played down the U.S. role in the sudden reconciliation.  \u201cThe U.S. obviously has been very supportive of Kenya\u2019s journey moving forward after what\u2019s been a difficult election period,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was very important action on their part to show that they are ready to work on behalf of all Kenyans \u2026 all the credit goes to the two leaders this morning.\u201d  Ahead of the visit, a senior State Department official said the U.S. had extensively engaged with Mr. Odinga to bring about reconciliation.  \u201cWhat we said to him ... is that you have a really tremendous opportunity for historic times to really push forward political and economic reforms,\u201d said acting assistant Secretary of State for Africa Donald Yamamoto.  The U.S. diplomatic mission has been involved in attempting mediation as the political crisis deepened.  In the past few months, anti-U.S. sentiment has been on the rise. Opposition supporters saw U.S. recognition of Mr. Kenyatta as a partisan move, and protesters demonstrated outside the U.S. embassy earlier this year over what they called U.S. interference.  Unrest following the two elections led to dozens of fatalities and has reopened the ethnic rifts that in 2007 left more than 1,000 people dead in postelection violence.  Mr. Odinga, who represents a large swath of the population who feel cut off from the country\u2019s elite, has accused Mr. Kenyatta of being a dictator and declared himself the \u201cpeople\u2019s president.\u201d  On Friday he shook Mr. Kenyatta\u2019s hand and promised to \u201cend these differences.\u201d  \u201cWe need to save our children from ourselves,\u201d Mr. Odinga said.  The surprise moves comes amid an escalation of a standoff that started last year ahead of August presidential elections.  In a first for Africa, the outcome of those elections was annulled by the country\u2019s Supreme Court, which ruled they had been marred by irregularities. Mr. Odinga boycotted new elections in October. Only one in three Kenyans took part, and Mr. Kenyatta was re-elected to another 5-year term with 98% of the vote.  Kenya\u2019s economy, a pole for international investment where Chinese-built mega infrastructure like a $4-billion dollar railway runs alongside an equally ambitious highway being built by U.S. construction giant Bechtel, felt the pain of the prolonged crisis.  Its growth rate, previously among the continent\u2019s highest at above 6%, and multiple times the world average, slowed down to 4.8% in 2017, according to the International Monetary Fund.

The proportion of executives who thought competitors were set to flood into their industry has halved from 54 percent to 26 percent compared to two years ago, the broad-based poll of business decision-makers showed.  \u201cThere\u2019s been a feeling historically that the elephants can\u2019t dance, the incumbents will find it hard to respond and that everyone will be Uber-ed or Airbnb-ed out of existence,\u201d Mark Foster, senior vice president of IBM Global Business Services, told Reuters in an interview.  \u201cBut what we are seeing is actually there is a limit as to how far that can go.\u201d  While some sectors had been hugely disrupted by new digital entrants and some intermediaries pushed out, many of those changes were now being led by existing industry players, he said.  Disruption is a catch-all term for the use of digital technology to up-end existing business models, for example Uber\u2019s impact on the taxi industry by using smartphones to connect riders with drivers, and pricing according to demand.  But just 27 percent of the executives surveyed said they were experiencing significant disruption, an unexpected finding given the deluge many predicted, IBM said. Only 23 percent said the big drivers of change were from outside their industries.  Digital giants, like Google, Apple and Facebook, continued to concentrate their power in some industries, but according to the executives surveyed they were not leading the disruption, and start-ups were increasingly quiescent, the survey found.  Instead, 72 percent said it was the most innovative incumbents who were leading the disruption, including in industries targeted by start-ups such as financial services.  IBM said the incumbents had become better at spotting and acquiring nascent disruptors. They had also realized the need to find partners, even sharing physical assets and people with them, to acquire new skills.  They are investing in the technologies that facilitate the sharing of data across organizations - such as the Internet of Things, which bridges physical and digital assets, and blockchain.  \u201cDisruption hasn\u2019t gone underground,\u201d IBM said in its report released before the start of the mobile industry\u2019s biggest event, the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.  \u201cInstead, it\u2019s emerging as a capability incumbents are ready to embrace.\u201d  IBM surveyed 12,854 top executives, such as chief executives and finance directors, from 112 countries for its report.  \u201cWho Says Elephants Can\u2019t Dance\u201d was the title of the memoir of 1990s era IBM CEO Lou Gerstner, who is credited with bringing the company back from a near-death experience by shifting it into software and services and exiting most hardware businesses.", "stock": "IBM", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-25", "source": "reuters", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-telecoms-mobileworld-ibm-disruptors/major-firms-learning-to-adapt-in-fight-against-start-ups-ibm-idUSKCN1G90IB"}, {"article": "CIMON \u2014 the Crew Interactive Mobile Companion \u2014 is programmed to interact astronauts on the International Space Station. IBM  When German astronaut and scientist Alexander Gerst rockets to the International Space Station in June, he'll bring along an unusual friend: a flying, talking, intelligent robot.  Called the Crew Interactive Mobile Companion, or CIMON, the orb-shaped device weighs about 11 pounds and displays an expressive digital face. Its \"brain\" is powered in part by IBM Watson \u2014 the artificial intelligence software that defeated Jeopardy! champions Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter in 2011 and won $1 million. Aircraft manufacturer Airbus helped develop the robot as well.  \"In short, CIMON will be the first [artificial intelligence]-based mission and flight assistance system,\" Manfred Jaumann, a payload engineer at Airbus, said in a press release. He added that CIMON will be a \"a free flyer, a kind of flying brain\" that will interact with, aid, and learn from astronauts.  CIMON is a far cry from the HAL 9000 supercomputer from the classic sci-fi book and movie \"2001: A Space Odyssey,\" and it isn't the only flying robot headed to the ISS. But CIMON's capabilities are nonetheless impressive.  Training a floating head to be a friend  A photo illustration of CIMON solving a Rubik's cube aboard the International Space Station.

Gerst will unbox CIMON in June and use the flying robot through October. During that time, it will help Gerst solve basic problems and check off tasks like a digital assistant. But CIMON's prime mission is to complete three goals: experiment with crystal growth in space, solve a Rubik's cube, and \"perform a complex medical experiment using CIMON as an 'intelligent' flying camera,\" according to Airbus.  \"Experiments sometimes consist of more than 100 different steps, CIMON knows them all,\" Matthias Biniok, the lead Watson architect in Germany, said in an IBM blog post.  IBM, Airbus, and DLR are working together to fly an artificially intelligent device called the Crew Interactive Mobile Companion, or CIMON, to the International Space Station. Airbus CIMON will use a neural network to interact with and learn from Gerst, at least at first.  Ultimately, CIMON will spy on space station astronauts to help assess their emotional states and psychological \"group effects,\" Biniok said \u2014 a feature that could help better engineer months- or years-long journeys to the moon or Mars.  \"Social interaction between people and machines, between astronauts and assistance systems equipped with emotional intelligence, could play an important role in the success of long-term missions,\" Airbus said.  \"We predict that assistance systems of this kind also have a bright future right here on earth, such as in hospitals or to support nursing care,\" Biniok said.

I found it fascinating, cover to cover. I was especially struck by a section about the history of the tech industry, drawn from the work of historian Nathan Ensmenger of Indiana University \u2014 specifically, how it first became so male-dominated and the societal factors that perpetuate that trend today.  Ensmenger's research takes us back in time to 1967, with an article in Cosmopolitan titled \"The Computer Girls.\" The author describes how a new field called programming had emerged, dominated by women. A female senior systems analyst could make \"$20,000 \u2014 and up!\" ($150,000 in today's world). IBM systems engineer, Ann Richardson, is featured in a photo \"sporting a dress, pearly earrings, and a short bouffant.\" The truth is the tech industry was dominated by women in its early days.  IBM  Why were so many women in these roles in 1967? The marketplace standard for all business in the selection of programmers was based on a gender-neutral test called the IBM Programmer Aptitude Test that assessed logical reasoning and math skills. The test was widely used in the industry (at the time, 349 companies used the test to screen job candidates). Truly a tool of equal opportunity, it led to 20,000 women programmers in the US alone that same year. At the time, women were 10% to 15% of the graduating classes with computer science degrees.  Later, two psychologists developed a different, less scientific test after studying a sample of programmers (only 15% were women) to understand the personality of satisfied programmers. Finding these programmers were often short on social skills (\"they prefer things to people\"), the psychologists initiated a personality test called the Programmer Scale. And the persona of \"computer nerds\" was born.  This personality profiling test became the new industry standard for hiring practices, even as the number of women taking computing degrees had risen to 37% by the early 1980s. Slowly but surely, that standard profiled many women out of tech jobs \u2014 despite the poor science behind it. As computers gained momentum, these computer programmers began to develop products for the consumer market \u2014 including toys \u2014 not surprisingly, mostly marketed to boys.  Fast forward 10 years. Firms were hiring male graduates who had cut their teeth on tech and coding learned from those very computer games. The stereotype only grew stronger with time, leading to the \"bro culture\" and current conditions in Silicon Valley that often marginalize women. By 2013, women made up less than 18% of university computer science classes, a drop of 20 points in about 30 years.  We can only imagine what other outcome we might have seen in tech had the industry not taken that turn in the late 1960s. What might the \"Computer Girls\" of later generations have created if they continued to flood tech and business with their talents?  Many firms \u2014 tech included \u2014 have made meaningful progress toward welcoming women back into the fold, but we still have a long way to go. By 2020, Girls Who Code estimates there will be 1.4 million computing-related jobs in the US alone, only 3% of which will be filled by women. By 2022, it's estimated there will be 2 million unfilled roles in Cybersecurity, yet women only make up 10% of the current cybersecurity workforce.  Who we hire for tech roles will have an impact on the success of our organizations. We know that diverse teams are more innovative, and in an era where bias can be built into artificial intelligence used by all of us, it becomes imperative to build diverse teams to create and deploy technology. The time to act is now.  It will take a multi-dimensional strategy to reverse the course of the last 50 years and re-populate the tech field with a large contingent of women. One lesson from this past history is bias in how we select employees for tech roles. While hackathons may be fun, they favor people with prior coding experience, further marginalizing women with innate skills for coding but not afforded the same computer game culture as their male peers.  At IBM, we are fortunate to have had deep roots in diversity from the very beginning. We were honored this year to receive the acclaimed Catalyst Award for our work to advance women and diversity in business, an award we have not won for 18 years, but we are proud to have won four times. No other tech company has received this award since the 1990s. But the changes in the industry are now palpable \u2014 we see tech companies across the US \u2014 and the world \u2014 stepping up to fight for gender equity in the industry.  Let's hope this marks the beginning of a trend.  After all, today's women (just like the 1960s \"Computer Girls\") have such valuable ideas and contributions to offer. The stakes are high. Let's not settle for bias \u2014 even unconscious bias \u2014 in the AI that is embedded in our world \u2014 whether it's the games we play, the cars we drive, or the technologies that shape our daily lives.

According to an IBM study, 52% of Gen Z females would like to see tools that allow them to customize products for themselves.  Similarly, e-commerce and niche direct-to-consumer brands have dramatically impacted and sped up how products are designed and introduced. Shoppers can now see runway videos on social media and expect those styles to immediately become available for purchase. And even though some fast fashion retailers can get products onto shelves in just weeks, most apparel takes six to 12 months for development.  IBM's AI capabilities can give retailers an edge to speed up the inspirational design phase, helping designers and fashion houses better personalize offerings and meet customers' expectations of designs.  That's why our school, the Fashion Institute of Technology, teamed up with Tommy Hilfiger and IBM on a recent project using IBM Research AI tools to analyze real-time images and fashion industry trends. These AI tools looked at 15,000 images of Tommy Hilfiger products and some 600,000 publicly available runway images to better decipher the silhouettes, colors, and styles. One tool, which analyzed nearly 100,000 patterns from various fabric websites, produces novel and unique patterns \u2014 all which informed and inspired our designs.  \"The goal was to equip the next generation of retail leaders with new skills and bring informed inspiration to their designs with the help of AI,\" said Avery Baker, the chief brand officer at Tommy Hilfiger in an IBM blog post. \"AI can identify upcoming trends faster than industry insiders to enhance the design process.\"  Here are some key takeaways from our experience.  Learning about AI and fashion design  \"As a fashion designer, I tend to stay in my own head, but with these tools, I was able to look into databases that were curated with an incredible amount of information, which, in turn, inspired in new ways that I could make design decisions faster.\" \u2014 Grace McCarty  \"The tools that I used were the silhouette recognition tool, the color analysis tool, and the print tool, which make the designer's job easier and more efficient but does not take their role. AI technologies and fashion designers will be in a symbiotic relationship.\" \u2014 Amy Taehway Eun  How technology like AI will change our roles as designers  \"The traditional design process will always exist; for example, journal research, collecting fabrics, etc. But I believe that taking an innovative approach, like we did with this project, will help designers understand the new tools available to enhance our designs for the future. Technology is improving and changing by the day, and I think we are very lucky to have the chance to be a part of this movement.\" \u2014 Stefka de Ruiter  \"As a result of this project, I can see that the relationship between AI and designers will be collaborative. Technology will help designers create new and fresh products. In the end, I believe a designer's role will be the same. They will research inspirations, they will design, but they will have better options and a different perspective offered to them by AI technology.\" \u2014 Amy Taehway Eun  \"I believe tools like the color print tool or the color trend tool only aided my design process. What would take hours of research can now be accomplished in a few hours with the click of a button.\" \u2014 Luis Hernandez Bermejo  Our favorite part of the project  \"My favorite part of this project was being able to work with so many different people from so many different fields. I also loved being able to experiment with all of the tools. I am someone who is constantly looking for new media to either enhance my designs or my design process.\" \u2014 Grace McCarty  \"One of favorite parts was playing with cognitive fashion tools. I especially liked using the print tool. I had such a great time putting lots of images into the tool and seeing what kind of results came out.

From pasteurization to refrigeration, every advance in food safety keeps people healthier and safer.  But our modern systems are far from perfect. According to Health.gov, foodborne illnesses affect 48 million Americans, lead to 128,000 hospitalizations, and result in 3,000 deaths each year. There's a lot of room for improvement, and Golden State Foods (GSF) is making it their mission to help close that gap through innovation.  To other enterprises in the food industry, \"innovation\" might just be a buzzword that means exotic menus, cocktails in jam jars, or pickling unusual foods, but GSF has a more technical approach. They use the Internet of Things (IoT) to ensure transparency across their entire supply chain, enabling them to maintain unprecedented awareness of their food quality and safety.  GSF produces and ships food in immense quantities. To give you an idea of how massive their operations are, they produce 400,000 hamburger patties every hour. To get that food to your mouth, they have a fleet of more than 2,000 trucks and various other shipping methods supplying 125,000 restaurants in over 60 countries, including McDonald's, Starbucks, Taco Bell, and countless others. So, if you've been thinking to yourself, \"I've never eaten anything from Golden State Foods,\" you're probably mistaken.  In that massive network of kitchens, trucks, and restaurants, there are countless things to keep watch over. Throughout the food's journey, sufficiently cold temperatures must be maintained in order to prevent the growth of dangerous microorganisms. That cold chain is a fragile system that demands vigilance and consistency. Unfortunately, machines can break down or malfunction. When that happens without anybody's knowledge, it's a safety hazard. But with GSF's envisioned new IoT-enabled supply chain, sensor data could be collected at every moment of the food's journey and analyzed in real time by the IBM Watson IoT Platform, ensuring that issues are automatically reported and addressed before they cause bigger problems down the line.  GSF's knack for innovation doesn't stop at the supply chain. Their Connected Restaurant project uses IBM's Connected Store solutions to revolutionize the way restaurants maintain food safety and freshness. Door hinge sensors, digital signage, and with the future plan to include shelf weight sensors, gesture recognition, and Wi-Fi tags collect valuable data that help managers understand how their restaurants consume energy, manage inventory, and keep clean \u2014 even helping them identify ways to do those things better. Most importantly, temperature sensors in food storage facilities trigger alerts if food reaches an unsafe temperature, prompting workers to make corrections immediately that will ensure food safety.  This is why the Internet of Things is the perfect representation of how technology can dramatically enhance human expertise. For centuries, the most meticulous mechanics and engineers have worked with the most brilliant machines of their time, but history is riddled with examples of catastrophic consequences resulting from seemingly unavoidable knowledge gaps. But with a constant flow of sensor data and a platform that's smart and fast enough to process that information, IoT gives us the capacity to have complete, real-time visibility into every physical thing we interact with in the world.

Consider Mr. Chenault some much-needed adult supervision.  \u201cWhat I think is happening right now in the digital space is a maturation cycle and some people, as we\u2019ve seen, are going to handle that well and some people are going to crash and burn,\u201d he said, without naming names.  Of course, he could be talking about any of a host of companies, like Uber, Google or Facebook, the latter of which is facing a revolt among consumers and possibly regulators over the way fake news proliferates on its site.  Venture capital firms themselves are not exempt from these problems, as my colleague Katie Benner chronicled last summer with a striking expos\u00e9 of harassment by powerful investors.  \u201cGiven their age and the scale and size and impact that they can have on our society, unless they make a step up, we are going to have some serious problems,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Chenault said. \u201cAnd we do have serious problems.\u201d  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  \u201cCompanies are starting to realize that they are growing up, and in growing up, they have to assume some broader responsibilities,\u201d he added. \u201cCompanies are at different stages, from a self awareness standpoint, in accepting that reality.\u201d  Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

As start-ups are staying private longer, venture capital firms are finding that someone has to actually run the companies they invest in, to think beyond the early stages of fast growth \u2014 and a quick sale or initial public offering \u2014 and to help them scale over a decade.  \u201cThe median time to I.P.O. has risen dramatically over the last decade, from 4.9 years in 2006 to 8.3 years in 2016,\u201d according to a report from Pitchbook, a data company that tracks deals. Airbnb has been private for 10 years, Uber for nine.  When Mr. Chenault joined Airbnb\u2019s board last week, a company co-founder, Brian Chesky, whom Mr. Chenault has mentored for years, wrote a note to employees announcing the appointment. \u201cMany companies are designed to be finite,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Chesky wrote. \u201cFinite companies are focused on beating their competitors and appeasing short-term interests. But business is not finite. Unlike sports, there is no time clock, so there can be no winning or losing \u2014 there is merely surviving and innovating to endure.\u201d  Mr. Chenault believes there is real value in trying to influence start-ups early in their life cycle, so that patience and foresight become embedded in the DNA.  One problem Mr. Chenault wants to address \u2014 conspicuous to anyone paying attention, but bafflingly inconspicuous to those in the Valley \u2014 is the lack of diversity, both in gender and race, in the tech industry.  \u201cDiversity in the technology digital industry is a big issue,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t make accelerated progress in that area, it will have dire consequences for our society.\u201d  It is even worse in the venture capital industry, where there are few women and even fewer African-Americans.  The numbers are embarrassing and depressing: African-Americans make up only 3 percent of the venture capital work force, according to a study conducted in 2016 by the National Venture Capital Association and Deloitte University Leadership Center for Inclusion. Latinos represented only 4 percent of the venture capital industry.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Mr. Chenault said he has known some of founding partners at General Catalyst for more than 20 years, including David Fialkow and Joel Cutler, who have been business partners since they met as children at Camp Cedar (a summer camp in Maine that I also attended). The fund, which has some $3.75 billion, was founded in Cambridge, Mass., in 1999 and has offices in New York; Palo Alto, Calif.; and San Francisco. Mr. Chenault said he would be based in New York.  In addition to Facebook and Airbnb, he is also on the boards of IBM and Procter & Gamble, which gives him insight into what\u2019s going on in the economy. He acknowledged that there might be times he has to recuse himself from dealing with board issues that conflict with one of the investments General Catalyst makes.  But at this stage of his career, he believes a move to venture capital is the right \u201cvehicle\u2019\u2019 to try to make a difference. Mr. Chenault hopes to help companies not just make long-term plans, but to think about their role in society.  \u201cVenture capital firms have to be more catalytic agents of change not just in the business development,\u201d he said, \u201cbut in helping change the culture in the technology digital sector so there is a greater focus on the responsibilities they have.\u201d", "stock": "IBM", "label": -1, "date": "2018-01-30", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/29/business/dealbook/kenneth-chenault-silicon-valley.html"}, {"article": "The concept for the databases used by most of the world\u2019s big corporations came out of IBM. But another company, Oracle, turned that software into a big business. Researchers at the Silicon Valley lab of Xerox famously pioneered the technology that went into many of Apple\u2019s computers.  Photo  And executives at Alphabet would certainly remember that Google was hardly the first internet search engine. It was just better than anything that came before it.  Other than an ownership stake in Uber, worth about $245 million, that came with settling the lawsuit, Waymo has not made substantial money from those years of research.  That is worth noting, because so many of the companies competing with Waymo are relying on the brainpower of its former employees. Dave Ferguson, a former Waymo engineer, oversees a start-up called Nuro, which is building a driverless car for shipping and delivering goods. Chris Urmson, a longtime Waymo engineer, is the chief executive of a start-up called Aurora. Brian Salesky, a third Waymo engineer, is now at Argo, an autonomous vehicle start-up backed by $1 billion in funding from Ford Motor.  With that brain drain in mind, the Uber lawsuit can also be seen as a fight against a former Google engineer, Anthony Levandowski, who also took his services elsewhere \u2014 first to Otto, a start-up he created, and then to Uber just six months later.  The question was whether he took trade secrets with him. Waymo accused Uber of conspiring with Mr. Levandowski to steal its trade secrets and feed them into a driverless car project already underway inside the ride-hailing company. With Friday\u2019s settlement, Uber has promised that its cars will operate without the help of Waymo\u2019s intellectual property.  There are other issues for Waymo. Unlike Ford, General Motors or Toyota, Waymo does not manufacture and sell cars. Unlike Uber and Lyft, it does not operate a vast ride-hailing services where it could readily deploy vehicles equipped with its own self-driving technology.

And you have to offer a service that people really want to use,\u201d Mr. Ferguson said. \u201cYou have to get all of that right.\u201d  The competition still tips its hat to Waymo, and agrees that after nine years of work on autonomous vehicles, it leads the technology race. But the gap is closing. Recent changes in the way driverless cars are built and the rise of readily available hardware that can help these vehicles understand and respond to what is happening around them, have made it easier to compete.  Waymo executives were not available for interviews for this article.

Google began testing its self-driving prototypes on public roads in 2010, and this is what set off so many other efforts.  In the years since, the technology that drives these vehicles has changed in enormous ways thanks to the rise of \u201cneural networks,\u201d which are complex systems that can learn tasks on their own by analyzing vast amounts of data. By analyzing thousands of images, a neural network can, for example, learn to identify a pedestrian. Using these methods, engineers can build and improve self-driving cars at a far more rapid pace.  \u201cThis is profoundly important,\u201d said Mr. Urmson of Aurora, which is supplying self-driving technology to Volkswagen, Audi and Hyundai. \u201cWe can build on top of that revolution.\u201d  Photo  In 2011, Google was among the first companies to build a research lab dedicated to these rapidly evolving techniques, and a number of researchers from this lab eventually moved on to the Google self-driving car project. Google has also built the vast network of specialized hardware needed to drive this kind of \u201cmachine learning,\u201d even building a new computer chip suited to the task.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  These techniques are spreading across the industry. And anyone can immediately tap into enormous amounts of computing power through cloud services operated by the likes of Amazon, Microsoft and, yes, Google.  Many car manufacturers believe they will eventually catch up because they can deploy so many more cars equipped with sensors that can record real-world activity.  \u201cWhat the car companies have is the potential to harvest more data than anyone else,\u201d Gill Pratt, chief executive of the Toyota Research Institute, the Silicon Valley research and development operation created by the Japanese car company, said in an interview last fall. \u201cIt may be this that matters the most.\u201d  Waymo is unlikely to manufacture its own cars. But it may end up running its own self-driving service. Alphabet recently led a $1 billion investment in Lyft, and it could deploy its driverless cars through this existing ride-hailing option. Waymo is also running a private trial of its cars near Phoenix, and it has long hinted that it will offer some sort of undefined public service in the area.  Operating this kind of service is no small thing, and some question whether Waymo is equipped to do so. \u201cThis is where the Ubers and the Lyfts have an advantage,\u201d Mr. Ferguson said.  He cautioned that the departures from Waymo may have an unintended consequence for the entire industry: Many smart people are needed in the same place to figure things out.  \u201cYou need to have a lot of the best minds together to solve it,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of my fears is that we have spread the field a little thin.

Intel logo is seen behind LED lights in this illustration taken January 5, 2018. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration  Most of the lawsuits - 30 - are customer class action cases that claim that users were harmed by Intel\u2019s \u201cactions and/or omissions\u201d related to the flaws, which could allow hackers to steal data from computers.  Intel said in a regulatory filing it was not able to estimate the potential losses that may arise out of the lawsuits.  Security researchers at the start of January publicized two flaws, dubbed Spectre and Meltdown, that affected nearly every modern computing device containing chips from Intel, Advanced Micro Devices Inc and ARM Holdings.  The companies have issued fixes but some patches slowed down computers, leading sector analysts to say producers could potentially face suits from clients and consumers claiming damages because their devices did not work as they should.  The company said the remaining two suits were securities class actions, where the plaintiffs allege that Intel and some of its officers violated securities laws by making statements about products or its internal controls that were later revealed to have been false or misleading.  The company\u2019s filing also listed three individual Intel shareholders who had filed actions against members of Intel\u2019s board and other managers, alleging that they failed their duties to Intel by failing to take action in relation to alleged insider trading.  It did not specify what allegations of wrongdoing the suit dealt with.  Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich sold 889,879 shares in the company on Nov. 29 as per a trading plan adopted on Oct. 30, making roughly $39 million from the sale, well before the details of the flaw were made public.  Bloomberg reported last month that although Intel says Krzanich\u2019s sales were part of a pre-arranged stock plan, securities lawyers believed the larger-than-usual transaction could be examined by the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC).  Krzanich said last month that Google researchers told Intel of the flaws \u201ca while ago\u201d.

FILE PHOTO: A sign on the Qualcomm campus is seen, as chip maker Broadcom Ltd announced an unsolicited bid to buy peer Qualcomm Inc for $103 billion, in San Diego, California, U.S. November 6, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo  Qualcomm has been a supplier of components to Apple for years but the relationship turned sour last year when Apple accused Qualcomm of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates.  In a detailed note citing extensive channel checks with chip suppliers, brokerage Nomura Instinet said it anticipated that Apple would drop Qualcomm in favour of a handful of other suppliers, as it seeks to reduce materials costs for iPhones.  Nomura said it believed Apple would source all of its thin modems - half of which are currently supplied by Qualcomm - from Intel.  Intel shares were up 1.4 percent at $46.81. The world\u2019s biggest PC chipmaker was a late entrant into the market for mobile chips, but has recently been pushing aggressively into the space.  \u201cThere is speculation that Apple might drop Qualcomm altogether for its next generation phones and I think that\u2019s part of the reason the stock is down today,\u201d said Angelo Zino, an analyst at CFRA Research.  Qualcomm issued a revenue forecast last week that missed estimates. It said the forecast already included the assumption that Apple could drop its chips for future products.  Apple will save more than $100 million in the next iPhone cycle by moving to cheaper Intel modem chips, Nomura analyst Romit Shah said.  Broadcom Ltd, which is trying to acquire Qualcomm, will likely lose some $400 million worth of sales of Apple parts in the second half of the year to Qorvo Inc, Shah added.  The reports came as Broadcom on Monday sweetened its bid to buy Qualcomm to more than $121 billion from an earlier $103 billion.  Qualcomm was hit with a $1.23 billion fine by European Union antitrust regulators last month for paying Apple to use only its chips, blocking out rivals such as Intel.  Intel began supplying modem chips to Apple from the iPhone 7 onwards.  Reuters reported in October that Apple had designed iPhones and iPads that would drop chips supplied by Qualcomm. reut.rs/2nNkkGC  Analysts at KGI Securities said Intel's modem chips were less expensive than Qualcomm chips and also met Apple's standards, according to Apple news website 9to5Mac. bit.ly/2FKdoBB  Sector analysts have said in the past that Intel may not be as well prepared for 5G networking as Qualcomm, and that iPhones with Qualcomm chips have performed better than models running on Intel chips.  KGI Securities did not rule out a return by Qualcomm to the supply chain, perhaps in the form of concessions in the patent lawsuit settlement.  Apple and Intel declined to comment.

Intel logo is seen behind LED lights in this illustration taken January 5, 2018. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illutration  Current and former U.S. government officials have raised concerns that the government was not informed of the flaws before they became public because the flaws potentially held national security implications. Intel said it did not think the flaws needed to be shared with U.S. authorities as hackers had not exploited the vulnerabilities.  Intel did not tell the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team, better known as US-CERT, about Meltdown and Spectre until Jan. 3, after reports on them in online technology site The Register had begun to circulate.  US-CERT, which issues warnings about cyber security problems to the public and private sector, did not respond to a request for comment.  Details of when the chip flaws were disclosed were detailed in letters sent by Intel, Alphabet and Apple Inc on Thursday in response to questions from Representative Greg Walden, an Oregon Republican who chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The letters were seen by Reuters.  Alphabet said that security researchers at its Google Project Zero informed chipmakers Intel, Advanced Micro Devices Inc and SoftBank Group Corp-owned ARM Holdings of the problems in June.  It gave the chipmakers 90 days to fix the issues before public disclosing them, standard practice in the cyber security industry intended to give the targets of bugs time to fix them before hackers can take advantage of the flaws.  Alphabet said it left the decision of whether to inform government officials of the security flaws up to the chipmakers, which is its standard practice.  Intel said it did not inform government officials because there was \u201cno indication that any of these vulnerabilities had been exploited by malicious actors,\u201d according to its letter.  Intel also said it did not perform an analysis of whether the flaws might harm critical infrastructure because it did not think it could affect industrial control systems. But Intel said that it did inform other technology companies that use its chips of the issue, according to its letter.  Intel, Alphabet and Apple could not immediately be reached for comment.  AMD, ARM, Microsoft Corp and Amazon.com Inc also responded to questions from lawmakers.  Microsoft said that it did inform several antivirus software makers about the flaws \u201cseveral weeks\u201d ahead of their public disclosure to give them time to avoid compatibility issues.

Apple Inc. is planning to use its own chips in Mac computers beginning as early as 2020, replacing processors from Intel Corp., according to people familiar with the plans.  The initiative, code named Kalamata, is still in the early developmental stages, but comes as part of a larger strategy to make all of Apple\u2019s devices -- including Macs, iPhones, and iPads -- work more similarly and seamlessly together, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. The project, which executives have approved, will likely result in a multi-step transition.  The shift would be a blow to Intel, whose partnership helped revive Apple\u2019s Mac success and linked the chipmaker to one of the leading brands in electronics. Apple provides Intel with about 5 percent of its annual revenue, according to Bloomberg supply chain analysis.  Intel shares dropped as much as 9.2 percent, the biggest intraday drop in more than two years, on the news. They were down 6.4 percent at $48.75 at 3:30 p.m. in New York.  Apple could still theoretically abandon or delay the switch. The company declined to comment. Intel said, \u201cWe don\u2019t comment on speculation about our customers.\u201d  For Apple, the change would be a defining moment. Intel chips remain some of the only major processor components designed by others inside Apple\u2019s product portfolio. Currently, all iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches, and Apple TVs use main processors designed by Apple and based on technology from Arm Holdings Plc. Moving to its own chips inside Macs would let Apple release new models on its own timelines, instead of relying on Intel\u2019s processor roadmap.  \u201cWe think that Apple is looking at ways to further integrate their hardware and software platforms, and they\u2019ve clearly made some moves in this space, trying to integrate iOS and macOS,\u201d said Shannon Cross, an analyst at Cross Research. \u201cIt makes sense that they\u2019re going in this direction. If you look at incremental R&D spend, it\u2019s gone into ways to try to vertically integrate their components so they can add more functionality for competitive differentiation.\u201d  Stand Out  The shift would also allow Cupertino, California-based Apple to more quickly bring new features to all of its products and stand out from the competition. Using its own main chips would make Apple the only major PC maker to use its own processors. Dell Technologies Inc., HP Inc., Lenovo Group Ltd., and Asustek Computer Inc. use Intel chips.  By using its own chips, Apple would be able to more tightly integrate new hardware and software, potentially resulting in systems with better battery life -- similar to iPads, which use Apple chips.  While the transition to Apple chips in hardware is planned to begin as early as 2020, the changes to the software side will begin even before that. Apple\u2019s iPhones and iPads with custom chips use the iOS operating system, while Mac computers with Intel chips run on a different system called macOS. Apple has slowly been integrating user-facing features over the past several years, and more recently starting sharing lower-level features like a new file management system.  \u2018Marzipan\u2019 Platform  As part of the larger initiative to make Macs work more like iPhones, Apple is working on a new software platform, internally dubbed Marzipan, for release as early as this year that would allow users to run iPhone and iPad apps on Macs, Bloomberg News reported last year.  The company has also previously released Macs with ARM-based co-processors, which run an iOS-like operating system, for specific functions like security. The latest MacBook Pro and iMac Pro include the co-processors. Apple plans to add that chip to a new version of its Mac Pro, to be released by next year, and new Mac laptops this year, according to a person familiar with the matter.  Intel has dominated computing processors for more than a decade, taking market share from Advanced Micro Devices Inc., its only rival in the market. Intel also designs and builds modem chips for some iPhone models so that they can connect to cellular networks and make calls. While Apple is down the list of computer sellers by unit shipments, it\u2019s third when measured by revenue last year, highlighting the premium status of its products.  Apple\u2019s decision to switch away from Intel in PC\u2019s wouldn\u2019t have a major impact on the chipmaker\u2019s earnings because sales to the iPhone maker only constitute a small amount of its total, said Kevin Cassidy, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. A bigger concern would be if this represents part of a wider trend of big customers moving to designing their own components, he said.  In 2005, Apple announced a move to Intel chips in its Macs, an initiative that put former Intel Chief Executive Officer Paul Ottelini on stage with Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. It was a partnership that shook up the PC industry and saw Apple shift away from chips co-developed by IBM and Motorola.  Apple\u2019s current chip designs made their name in thin and light mobile devices. That would indicate Apple will start the transition with laptops before moving the designs into more demanding desktop models. Apple has to walk the fine line of moving away from Intel chips without sacrificing the speed and capabilities of its Macs.  A decision to go with ARM technology in computers might lend it credibility where it has failed to gain a foothold so far. Qualcomm Inc., the biggest mobile phone chip provider, is working with PC makers to introduce new thin and light laptops based on its chips in another attempt to steal share from Intel. Microsoft Corp. is supporting that effort by providing a version of its Windows operating system for ARM technology-based chips.  Intel\u2019s dominance of the market has been based on its ability to use leading manufacturing technology to produce processors that are more powerful than those of its competitors. Its would-be rivals haven\u2019t yet produced designs that have displaced Intel\u2019s products when it comes to crunching data quickly.  Apple\u2019s custom processors have been recently manufactured principally by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Ltd. Its decision may signal confidence that TSMC and other suppliers such as Samsung Electronics Co. have closed the gap on Intel\u2019s manufacturing lead and can produce processors that are just as powerful.", "stock": "INTC", "label": -1, "date": "2018-04-02", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-02/apple-is-said-to-plan-move-from-intel-to-own-mac-chips-from-2020"}, {"article": "Intel Corp., whose microprocessors dominate the personal-computer market, gave an upbeat quarterly and annual sales forecast, signaling optimism that demand will persist even as the industry scrambles to fix vulnerabilities in its PC and server chips.  Sales in the current period will be about $15 billion, plus or minus $500 million, and annual revenue will rise to a record $65 billion, the company said in a statement late Thursday. The projections exceed analysts\u2019 estimates.  Intel shares gained 6 percent in pre-market trading at 6:04 a.m. in New York Friday, after closing at $45.30. The stock rose 27 percent in 2017, lagging behind the 38 percent advance in the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index. The benchmark has outpaced Intel so far this year, too.  Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich is trying to remake Intel into a more general provider of chips, expanding into new markets such as self-driving cars and industrial systems. While those efforts helped, it was a 20 percent sales jump in its data-center chip business that really powered the quarter -- and will determine success for the foreseeable future.  Intel repeated its assertion that chip flaws known as Meltdown and Spectre won\u2019t have a material impact on its finances. Forecasts didn\u2019t budge after the potential exploits were made public in early January. Krzanich said Intel has made progress on patching exposed computer systems, but said he\u2019s \"acutely aware that we have more to do.\u201d  The chipmaker\u2019s outlook indicates that corporations are spending on infrastructure, a good sign for earnings reports by companies such as Microsoft Corp., Kim Forrest, an analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group, which owns Intel shares.  \"They look really good,\u201d she said. \u201cEven the data center came back.\u201d  In the fourth quarter, sales climbed 4.3 percent to $17.1 billion, Intel said. The company posted a net loss of 15 cents a share because of an income tax expense of $5.4 billion, a result of the new U.S. tax law passed last month. Excluding certain items, profit was $1.08 a share. On that basis, analysts had projected 87 cents in profit, on revenue of $16.4 billion.  Intel Chief Financial Officer Bob Swan said the boost in Intel\u2019s sales and profit in the recent quarter came from a return to spending by corporations on their internal networks. That trend may not continue, he said. Sales to cloud-service providers -- companies such as Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and Amazon.com Inc. -- rose 35 percent in the fourth quarter.  \u201cWe see good demand trends\u201d in the first quarter, Swan said in an interview. \u201cThe biggest pleasant surprise was enterprise.\u201d  After it announced the vulnerabilities Jan. 3, Intel said its chips were not faulty -- they work as promised -- noting that the potential exploits affect all modern processors, not just Intel products. It then accepted more responsibility, apologized and began submitting regular updates on efforts to roll out software patches that close security holes. While there have been no reports of data being stolen via these methods, some of the patches have caused computers to repeatedly reboot or slow down, particularly older machines.  Intel\u2019s PC chip unit had fourth-quarter sales of $9 billion, down 2 percent from a year earlier. Santa Clara, California-based Intel is facing a revived challenge in the PC market from longtime rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc.  The data-center unit, which sells powerful, expensive chips for machines that run the internet and corporate networks, had revenue of $5.6 billion, up 20 percent. Intel\u2019s CEO has promised long-term growth in that unit of more than 10 percent, though gains in recent quarters had fallen short of that target. In the third quarter, data-center division sales rose just 7 percent.  Sales of memory chips rose 9 percent, while revenue from chips for a new range of devices that are gaining the ability to compute and connect, known as the internet of things, climbed 21 percent.  Intel\u2019s renewed commitment to memory chips takes it into direct competition with Samsung Electronics Co., the only company in the industry with comparable sales and manufacturing resources.  Intel invented the memory market when the company was founded in the late 1960s. It got out of the business in the early 1990s when competition from Asian companies became too great. This is typically the most volatile part of the chip industry. In some years, producers lose money when supply gluts cause prices to drop. Intel\u2019s latest memory chip foray made money in the fourth quarter, and the company expects it to remain profitable throughout 2018.  While overall performance has been strong by Intel, there are challenges ahead. For one, the company may not have generated enough sales to maintain its 25-year run as the world\u2019s largest chipmaker.

Thompson\u2019s favorite drugs, CES, held in Las Vegas each January, has always been a little surreal. This year\u2019s bacchanal was crammed with drones, self-driving cars, and internet-connected toilet seats\u2014and the opening keynote speech was stranger than any of that. On Jan. 8, 5,000 ticket holders made their way through a sea of hired models and ultra-high-definition TVs to the Monte Carlo Resort and Casino on the Strip, where they squeezed into a theater to watch a two-hour psychedelic variety show. The opening act, a Blue Man Group-style quartet called Algorithm \u2019n Blues, pantomimed a performance of Human by the Killers, backed up by a digital bassist on a giant LCD screen, flying drones that played keys on a giant piano, and a trio of acrobats, dressed like extras from Tron, who performed a trampoline routine. And that\u2019s not the weird part.  After the music came Brian Krzanich, chief executive of Intel Corp., doing about the best Willy Wonka impression one can do in a button-down blue dress shirt and jeans. \u201cI\u2019d love nothing more than to simply put my phone away and take this evening to truly celebrate innovation with you,\u201d the 57-year-old CES regular said, bragging about his company\u2019s advances in virtual reality and new partnerships with autonomous-vehicle technology companies. Former NFL quarterback Tony Romo appeared onstage to talk up Intel\u2019s work in 3D video, and Krzanich showed off a full-size pilotless helicopter before capping the evening by suggesting they head outside to see a light show over the famous Bellagio fountains involving hundreds of drones\u2014all, of course, either made by Intel or running on Intel chips.  CEO Krzanich holds Intel\u2019s latest drone, the Shooting Star Mini, as he speaks at CES in Las Vegas on Jan. 8. Photographer: Rick Wilking/Reuters  The whole thing was a dizzying reminder that although Intel isn\u2019t the household name it was during the PC boom of the 1990s, it can still put on a show. The company makes about 90 percent of the world\u2019s computer processors and 99 percent of the server chips in the data centers that effectively run the internet. While the world\u2019s largest chipmaker has struggled to expand beyond those core businesses, it reported $60 billion in 2017 revenue at a gross margin of 63 percent, an unimaginable profit for most factory owners.  What made the Intel keynote so surreal was that Krzanich barely mentioned the potentially catastrophic news that was on everyone\u2019s mind. The previous week, the Register, a British technology journal, reported that independent researchers had discovered flaws in Intel\u2019s chip designs that hackers could exploit to steal data thought to be the most secure. These vulnerabilities, known as Meltdown and Spectre, are a very, very big deal, allowing hackers to peek at the part of the computer where companies and individuals store passwords, encryption keys, and most anything sensitive. The flaws are unprecedented. Every PC, every smartphone, and every server in the world is exposed. The episode has already led to lawsuits and calls for investigations, and undermines more than a decade of Intel\u2019s technical wizardry.  For the past few years, major cloud providers have sought ways to reduce their dependence on Intel\u2019s server chip monopoly, quietly developing their own models or funding nascent competitors. And just days before Krzanich took the stage in Vegas, Intel gave those companies\u2014and everybody else\u2014a massive incentive to accelerate those efforts.  Even the researchers who discovered Meltdown and Spectre initially didn\u2019t believe what they were seeing. \u201cThat would have been such a major f--- -up by Intel that it can\u2019t be possible,\u201d researcher Michael Schwarz recalls thinking. Spectre affects all modern chips, including those made by competitors, but the easier hack, Meltdown, applies almost exclusively to chips made by Intel.  The flaws can be patched, but those patches could slow the Intel chips by as much as 30 percent, the equivalent of turning a state-of-the-art server chip into one from 2013. \u201cThere is no playbook for something like this,\u201d says Charles Carmakal, a vice president at Mandiant, the arm of security company FireEye that consults on high-profile hacks. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen a vulnerability that worked across so many different operating systems and devices.\u201d  If the slowdown turns out to be anywhere near as bad as some think it could be, it\u2019ll amount to a major price increase for data center owners, who could in turn demand that Intel cover the cost. (So far, the big cloud providers have said their customers won\u2019t be affected. Their plans, and the costs, remain unclear.) And because Intel is so reliant on chip revenue, there\u2019d be no easy way to make up those losses. Intel\u2019s stock is down 5 percent since the Register report; shares of Advanced Micro Devices Inc., its only real competitor for PC and server chips, are up 11 percent.  During the six months Intel was quietly working to try to fix the vulnerabilities, Krzanich sold $24 million in company shares. Intel says the stock sale was part of a plan that had been in place before anyone there knew about Meltdown or Spectre, but the day after Krzanich\u2019s CES speech, two U.S. senators sent letters to the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice demanding investigations. Consumer and shareholder lawyers have filed a dozen class actions against Intel, and there are few signs the pressure will let up on Krzanich anytime soon. In a research note, an analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. called the stock sale \u201cindefensible.\u201d  \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen a vulnerability that worked across so many different operating systems and devices\u201d  Intel, which declined to make Krzanich available for comment, has treated Meltdown and Spectre as something close to a nonstory. In its initial statement, issued on Jan. 3, the company disputed that Spectre and Meltdown represented \u201cflaws,\u201d describing them as merely a new field of \u201cresearch\u201d into an industrywide phenomenon. It said any slowdowns would be minimal, close to zero for most people, and that the episode would have no impact on Intel\u2019s business. At CES, after Algorithm \u2019n Blues but before Romo, Krzanich briefly addressed the not-flaw by thanking Intel\u2019s peers for \u201ccoming together\u201d to \u201caddress the recent security findings.\u201d  Intel\u2019s clients, including the biggest companies in the technology industry, have mostly kept quiet. They have no alternative supplier. Privately, some are seething. The day after Krzanich\u2019s big show, Microsoft Corp. published a blog post disputing Intel\u2019s earlier assertion that users wouldn\u2019t notice the slowdowns. Navin Shenoy, an Intel executive vice president, said in a statement that customer security is \u201ca critical priority\u201d for the company. In private conversations with clients, Intel\u2019s top managers haven\u2019t always acted that way, treating a disaster that threatens the security of every computer user and the profits of a whole category of businesses as no big deal, according to an executive at one of Intel\u2019s large customers. The potential fallout isn\u2019t an academic concern, the executive says, \u201cit\u2019s f---ing scary.\u201d  Part of what makes Meltdown and Spectre so terrifying is that they upend more than a decade of conventional wisdom about information security. Starting in the mid-2000s, Intel added a layer of security within its chips and began encouraging developers to store users\u2019 most sensitive information in the walled-off area rather than in regular software memory. Only about two years ago did researchers first notice, and begin trying to crack, a feature called speculative execution that Intel uses to speed up its chips. It essentially allows a chip to access any data it guesses a user is about to ask for, even if it\u2019s inside the secure area, before checking whether the user is allowed to access it. This is a big reason computers and smartphones have kept getting faster year after year. It also left a gaping security hole.  The feature\u2019s vulnerabilities were discussed at conferences and in academic papers but were considered merely theoretical until last spring, when Jann Horn, a 22-year-old researcher in Google\u2019s elite cybersecurity division, succeeded in reading private data from the secure area. Horn informed Intel in June, beating out three other research teams that discovered the flaw later in 2017. Together, they began working with Intel to patch the flaws; until the Register report, they\u2019d planned to disclose their findings on Jan. 9. As Google pointed out in a blog post about the discovery, the security flaws could allow a cloud user to covertly snoop on another customer\u2019s machine. Anyone with an Amazon Web Services account could, in theory, steal another AWS user\u2019s login data and access their files, though that would often require physical access to the target machine.  In interviews, Intel executives dispute suggestions that the company\u2019s focus on chip speeds led it to overlook obvious vulnerabilities. Intel says it\u2019s already provided software fixes for 90 percent of its chips and that this is nothing out of the ordinary. \u201cWe have an ongoing process to make our products better,\u201d says Stephen Smith, general manager of the company\u2019s data center group. \u201cWe just happen to be doing it under a spotlight now.\u201d At CES, Krzanich told the crowd that \u201cas of now\u201d Intel had \u201cnot received any information that these exploits have been used to obtain customer data.\u201d  This sounds more comforting than it probably should. Security analysts say that if four groups of researchers independently figured out the exploits, then some number of governments with sophisticated cyberweapons programs (China, Russia, the U.S.) likely did, too. An intelligence agency armed with Spectre or Meltdown would likely aim big, according to Mandiant\u2019s Carmakal. \u201cA government wouldn\u2019t use this to break into Target,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019d use it to get into the Department of Defense.\u201d  So far, Meltdown and Spectre probably pose less risk to the average person than, say, a simple phishing attack in which a hacker tries to send you to a malicious website. They won\u2019t lead to the kind of widespread panic that resulted from the 2017 hack of Equifax\u2019s customer database.  But that could change. Hackers who hadn\u2019t tried to break into Intel\u2019s hardware, believing there was no way it would leave a side door open, are now seeking ways in. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be looking for other things like this,\u201d says Jeff Pollard, an analyst with the research firm Forrester. \u201cThis is a new kind of attack. This is going to linger.\u201d  And long-term fixes won\u2019t be easy. While coders can pull a few all-nighters to close holes in software, a chip takes years to design, test, and mass-produce. Each model can cost tens of millions of dollars to develop. For now, computer owners and data center operators will have to make an unsavory choice: Use Intel\u2019s software patches and accept slower speeds, or skip the patches and remain at risk. (Intel has already said patches are causing some machines to reboot more often than usual.) Future designs will include hard-wired fixes that speed things up, but the first versions of those won\u2019t appear until later this year, the company says.  All of this puts Intel in a tough spot. The company is a nonfactor in the smartphone-chips business dominated by Samsung, Qualcomm, and ARM, and rival Nvidia has taken a commanding lead in the fast-growing market for graphics chips used in artificial intelligence applications. Now, Meltdown and Spectre threaten the core of Intel\u2019s business. The company has no competitor in server chips at the moment, but this episode could change that. Microsoft and Google have publicly praised Qualcomm Inc.\u2019s first server chip, which went on sale in November, and Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook all have internal divisions working on chip designs.  Intel\u2019s more immediate threat is political. It\u2019ll almost certainly have to withstand criticism from lawmakers at a time when governments around the world are increasingly skeptical of tech companies with de facto monopolies. \u201cThis hyper-dependence on one chipmaker, indeed one technology, although billed as a way to lower prices, has had the effect also of greatly increasing society\u2019s exposure not only to hackers but also to \u2018shock events\u2019 that disrupt entire systems,\u201d the Open Markets Institute, a Washington think tank that advocates for controls on market concentration, wrote in its weekly newsletter on Jan. 11. For now, Intel\u2019s big problem is Krzanich\u2019s stock sales, but if it becomes clear that customers have been harmed by hacking or higher costs, regulators will likely seek recourse through consumer protection suits, antitrust investigations, or both.  Intel has faced this kind of public pressure before. In 1994 the company was heavily criticized for trying to ignore evidence that its Pentium chips were generating errors for certain obscure calculations. The crisis caused IBM to announce that it would no longer ship machines that used the flawed chips. Intel\u2019s meticulously constructed brand, Intel Inside, which had served as a sort of Good Housekeeping Seal for computer buyers, suddenly looked questionable. As part of Intel\u2019s extensive mea culpa, then-CEO Andy Grove offered to replace all the buggy chips and took an inventory writedown of $475 million, about half its annual R&D budget at the time.  Grove\u2019s lesson, as he recounted in his business-advice book Only the Paranoid Survive, was that Intel had been caught out. Even a quarter-century into its existence, the massive company still saw itself as a scrappy tech startup. With its size and influence, he acknowledged, came new responsibilities. \u201cThe trouble was,\u201d Grove wrote, \u201cnot only didn\u2019t we realize that the rules had changed, but what was worse, we didn\u2019t know what rules we now had to abide by.\u201d  Intel has been the top chipmaker for the past 25 years, but Meltdown and Spectre could turn out to be much worse than the Pentium bug. If the company wants to maintain its position, it\u2019ll need real humility, not cheap theatrics.  \u2014With Dina Bass, Mark Bergen, Alex Webb, and Dune Lawrence", "stock": "INTC", "label": 1, "date": "2018-01-20", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-01-18/intel-has-a-big-problem-it-needs-to-act-like-it"}, {"article": "Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Intel Corp.\u2019s main rival in computer microprocessors, said a report earlier this month alleging that its chips have widespread, fundamental vulnerabilities greatly exaggerated the severity of the threat.  There are 13 potential exploits that will be fixed within weeks through software updates, the chipmaker said Tuesday in a statement. There\u2019s no evidence that of any of those holes has been used for malevolent purposes, and it would be extremely difficult to use any of them to attack computers, the Sunnyvale, California-based company said. AMD saw reports of unusual trading activity in its stock about a week ago when an Israeli company called CTS Labs went public with a report on the flaws and has reported it to the relevant authorities.  The chip industry was stung at the beginning of the year when Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google revealed that a flaw in all modern microprocessors may allow hackers to steal data such as passwords or encryption keys previously thought to be secure. AMD argued at the time that its chips were less at risk than those from Intel, which dominates the market for computer microprocessors.  \u201cIt\u2019s important to note that all the issues raised in the research require administrative access to the system, a type of access that effectively grants the user unrestricted access to the system,\u201d AMD Chief Technology Officer Mark Papermaster said in the statement, referring to the recent report. \u201cAny attacker gaining unauthorized administrative access would have a wide range of attacks at their disposal well beyond the exploits identified in this research.\u201d  The issue isn\u2019t related to the vulnerabilities Google identified in January and isn\u2019t caused by AMD\u2019s Zen architecture, a new design that underpins all of its new chips, AMD said in its statement. The chipmaker said that, unlike the more widespread Spectre and Meltdown issues identified in January, software fixes for the currently discovered vulnerabilities won\u2019t slow down computers.  On March 12, CTS Labs contacted AMD about the potential exploits. Then the firm went public 24 hours later with its report, according to AMD.  \u201cThe vulnerabilities we have discovered allow bad actors who infiltrated the network to persist in it, surviving computer reboots and re-installations of the operating system, while remaining virtually undetectable by most endpoint security solutions,\u201d CTS said in the report. \u201cThis allows attackers to engage in persistent virtually undetectable espionage, buried deep in the system and executed from AMD\u2019s Secure Processor and chipset.\u201d  CTS estimated that it would take \u201cmany months\u201d to address the issue. The researcher didn\u2019t give AMD that amount of time to fix the holes before drawing public attention to them, something that goes against standard practice in these situations.  \u201cI fault CTS Labs for not following industry-standard coordinated disclosure procedure,\u201d said Ben Gras, a researcher at Vrije University in Amsterdam who focuses on hardware security flaws. \u201cA widely accepted practice in these situations is to coordinate with the vendor and affected parties during a window of confidentiality before publicizing security sensitive information, reducing the impact of the research while still maintaining transparency. As it stands, this leads me to believe they are not acting in good faith, and make me interpret other aspects of this report skeptically.\u201d  On Wednesday, CTS said it disagreed with AMD\u2019s assessment of the risks posed by the weaknesses and the time frame for patching them. \"Our view is that AMD is attempting to downplay the significance of its vulnerabilities,\" CTS said in a statement.  \u2014 With assistance by Jeremy Kahn, and Gwen Ackerman", "stock": "INTC", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-20", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-20/amd-confirms-chip-vulnerability-says-report-exaggerated-danger"}, {"article": "Music-streaming service Spotify Technology SA has avoided the traditional path to a stock listing, eschewing costly investment bankers and saying it wants to price its shares at a level that will ensure stability rather than a big jump on the first day of trading.

How Apple Built a Chip Powerhouse to Threaten Qualcomm and Intel  The company already makes many of the chips for its iPhones, iPads, Macs and Watches. By Mark Gurman January 29, 2018 By Mark Gurman  For several years, Apple has been steadily designing more and more of the chips powering its iPhones, iPads, Macs and Apple Watches. This creates a better user experience and helps trump rivals. Recently the company got a fresh incentive to go all-in on silicon: revelations that microprocessors with components designed by Intel Corp., Arm Holdings Plc and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. are vulnerable to hacking. Steve Jobs long believed Apple should own the technologies inside its products rather than rely on mashups of components from other chip makers, including Samsung, Intel and Imagination Technologies. In 2008, the company made a small but significant step in that direction by acquiring boutique chip maker P.A. Semi. Two years later, Jobs unveiled the iPad. The world focused on the tablet\u2019s giant touchscreen, book-reading prowess and creativity apps. But the most ground-breaking technology was hidden away inside: the A4, Apple\u2019s first processor designed in-house. That original \u201csystem-on-a-chip\u201d has since been succeeded by increasingly powerful processors. Today, Apple packs its devices with custom components that process artificial intelligence tasks, track your steps, power game graphics, secure Face ID or Touch ID data, run the Apple Watch, pair AirPods to your phone and help make Macs work the way they do. The result: a chip powerhouse that could one day threaten the dominance of Qualcomm Inc. and even, eventually, Intel.

Apple declined to comment. Apple isn\u2019t the first company to create its own chips in-house. It\u2019s just the most successful. HP Inc., Motorola, International Business Machines Corp. and Koninklijke Philips NV all had chip divisions at one time or another. Those ultimately failed or stumbled because chip-making is the sport of kings: It\u2019s brutally expensive and requires massive scale. Apple has wisely focused on designing its silicon (for its system on a chips, Apple uses reference designs from Arm Holdings Plc). Manufacturing is left to others, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Apple\u2019s push into the complicated and pricey chips business makes sense so long as the company is selling 300 million devices a year. And it's not as though the entrenched players are going anywhere. Qualcomm is investing in next-generation 5G networks, several companies are making AI chips and Intel is pushing mobile processors. Meanwhile, Samsung, Apple's arch rival, is a major chip manufacturer in its own right. Apple has chip-building and testing facilities in unmarked buildings in and around hometown Cupertino, California, and in Herzliya, Israel, a hotbed of new technologies. The operation employs hundreds of people and is run by Johny Srouji, who joined Apple in 2008 after stints at Intel and IBM and has likened his chip architects to \u201cartists.\u201d In recent months, Srouji has been poaching more and more modem engineers from Qualcomm. The chipmaker builds iPhone modems but is engaged in a legal battle with Apple over licensing fees Qualcomm charges smartphone makers. Hiring Qualcomm people could mean Apple plans to eventually create its own modems, which connect phones to cellular networks. For now, Apple is considering using Intel and MediaTek Inc. exclusively for modems in this year\u2019s iPhone lineup, Bloomberg News reported last year.

The engineer\u2019s private airfield is nestled in a valley on the Northern California coast between Monterey and Santa Barbara, and it\u2019s remote by design, out past a swirl of tan and green fields. Bevirt, a 44-year-old whose bursts of childlike delight punctuate his otherwise quiet intensity, bounds out to greet the chopper, then points the arriving pair of reporters to the prototype resting on the dirt runway nearby. It\u2019s an exotic-looking white aircraft with numerous propellers. (Bevirt agreed to the visit only on the condition that physical specifics remain unpublished.) He calls it an air taxi. \u201cThis is what I have been dreaming about for 40 years,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the culmination of my life\u2019s work.\u201d  Bevirt is the founder and chief executive officer of Joby Aviation Inc., a startup that\u2019s spent the past nine years trying to design and build a whole new kind of short-hop aircraft. Believe it or not, things have been going well. We were the first two reporters to see a demo of the prototype, named Rachel after the women several of its creators used to date. The pilot managed a vertical takeoff, 15 minutes of flight in a 15-mile loop, and a safe landing. Powered by electric motors and sophisticated control software, the taxi performs like a cross between a drone and a small plane, able to zip straight up on takeoff and then fly at twice the speed of a helicopter while making about as much noise as a swarm of superbees. Bevirt says thousands of these sky cabs will one day shuttle people around cities, soaring above the conventional traffic below.  Broken promises of flying cars predate The Jetsons, but Bevirt has made believers out of people with deep pockets. On Feb. 1, Joby Aviation announced a fresh $100 million in venture funding, more than three times the capital it had raised before, from investors including Intel Capital, Toyota AI Ventures, JetBlue Technology Ventures, and Capricorn Investment Group, a prominent backer of Tesla and Space Exploration Technologies. \u201cThere are a lot of dreamers in this space, but we have done a lot of research here, and JoeBen has absolutely nailed the right time for it,\u201d says Bonny Simi, president of JetBlue\u2019s investment arm.  Thanks to advances in electric motors, batteries, software, and other components, the field of flying cars, air taxis, or whatever you want to call them (Sky Segways?) is a lot more crowded than it was even a couple of years ago. Larry Page, the CEO of Google parent Alphabet Inc., has pumped tens of millions of dollars into startups Kitty Hawk and Zee.Aero. A dozen other startups around the world have similar projects at various stages of design, as do Airbus SE and Boeing Co. Even Uber Technologies Inc. claims to be working on an air taxi service, tentatively called Uber Elevate. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to happen within the next 10 years,\u201d Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said during a Jan. 22 speech at a tech conference in Munich.  Bevirt\u2019s secrecy extends to the environs of Joby\u2019s camouflaged lair: The trailers that serve as his engineers\u2019 flight-control centers are covered in posters warning them about the area\u2019s mountain lions, snakes, spiders, and other deadly fauna. Bevirt does say Joby intends to build an aircraft that will hold four passengers and a pilot and will travel at least 150 miles on a single charge at an altitude of a few thousand feet or less. (That would mean the cabin wouldn\u2019t need to be pressurized.) \u201cAnother goal is to be 100 times more quiet during takeoff and landing than a helicopter and near-silent during flyovers,\u201d says Joby Executive Chairman Paul Sciarra, a co-founder of Pinterest, the image-centric wish list site.  All told, Joby\u2019s venture funding totals about $130 million  A trained mechanical engineer and sci-fi nerd, Bevirt made a fortune selling bendable tripods and other camera accessories more than a decade ago. He\u2019s poured that money into his aviation startup. A couple of years back, he had 35 people working on various prototype craft; now he has 120, most of them working far from the airfield at his 500-acre ranch in Santa Cruz. There, engineers make just about every part of the air taxi prototype, from the body and motors to the flight-control software.  Joby says it plans to mass-produce its air taxis for a ride-hailing service that it will operate. Bevirt\u2019s vision includes a landing pad for every office and cul-de-sac. Each trip, he says, will cost about as much as an Uber or Lyft ride does today, and eventually the air taxis will be fully autonomous. \u201cOur mission is to save a billion people an hour a day,\u201d he says. He\u2019s less confident about a rollout date, partly because the formidable challenges ahead include convincing politicians, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the cab-hailing public that air taxis are safe. \u201cWe are well into the design and build of the production vehicle\u201d was the most he\u2019d say on the subject of time to market.  While a whiff of the surreal hangs over Bevirt\u2019s claims that he\u2019ll \u201cchange people\u2019s relationship with aircraft,\u201d some of his investors are counting on it. JetBlue\u2019s Simi says she sees Joby as part of a broader shift in the aerospace industry, a way to make more personal forms of air travel a part of daily life. JetBlue has also invested in Zunum Aero, which is building an electric jet that can fly dozens of people 1,000 miles. And though Intel owns a stake in a German air taxi startup called Volocopter GmbH, Wendell Brooks, president of Intel Capital, says Joby \u201cis very far ahead relative to all the other things we\u2019ve seen.\u201d  For more on flying cars, check out the Decrypted podcast:  For more on the future of transportation, go to Bloomberg.com/hyperdrive", "stock": "INTC", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-01", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-01/air-taxi-startup-joby-has-a-working-prototype-and-a-fresh-100m"}, {"article": "Value of China\u2019s yearly chip imports dwarfs that of crude oil  China\u2019s aspiration to deploy 30 million autonomous vehicles within a decade is seeding a fledgling chip industry, with startups like Horizon Robotics Inc. emerging to build the brains behind those wheels.  The Beijing-based company is taking aim at Nvidia Corp. and Mobileye NV just as the autonomous-driving business takes off and uncertainty looms over international trade. Annual revenue from the chips used in driverless vehicles globally should more than double to $5 billion by 2021, according to Gartner Inc.  A screen shows a demonstration of the cognition level of Horizon Robotics\u2019 Journey processor. Photographer: Giulia Marchi/Bloomberg  Horizon Robotics is an example of China\u2019s resolve to move up the manufacturing value chain by focusing less on commodity smartphones and TVs, and more on sophisticated semiconductors and artificial intelligence that can help cars drive themselves or spaceships land on the moon. That industrial policy is meant to help China reduce its 1.75 trillion yuan ($276.4 billion) in annual chip imports, a value dwarfing its oil imports.  \u201cChina has to spare no efforts to pick up and develop its own chip technology to improve our own sense of security, especially when the U.S. government is making us fearful about any protectionism against China,\u201d Wei Shaojun, director of the Beijing-based Institute of Microelectronics at Tsinghua University, said at a forum in Shanghai.  A Horizon Robotics processor sits onboard a vehicle. Photographer: Giulia Marchi/Bloomberg  China\u2019s push for self-reliance is a priority for President Xi Jinping\u2019s administration, which set up a 200 billion-yuan fund for investments in homegrown chipmakers, Bloomberg News reported.  Overseers of the world\u2019s largest car market -- and electric-vehicle market -- want to put Chinese-developed chips under those hoods and behind those dashboards. The government expects to have a manufacturing industry for parts such as sensors and embedded chips with a production value exceeding 100 billion yuan by 2020.  More Chips in Your Tesla Market for sophisticated semiconductors set to boom as cars get more features Source: Gartner, Bloomberg Intelligence  \u201cEveryone is on the same starting line, thus creating an opportunity for China,\u201d said Ding Wenwu, president of the state-backed China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund Co.  Horizon Robotics was founded in 2015 by Yu Kai, the former head of Baidu Inc.\u2019s artificial-intelligence business called the Institute of Deep Learning. Its investors include Intel Capital Corp., Shanghai-based Harvest Fund Management Co., Russian billionaire Yuri Milner and state-owned China Jianyin Investment Ltd.  The company completed a $100 million funding round in December.

GMC Yukon XL at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January. The processor can detect as many as 200 targets -- including pedestrians, vehicles and lane markings -- in real time and help the driverless car avoid collisions.  \u201cChinese companies have been evolving from the positions of made-in-China to created-in-China,\u201d said Yu, 42. \u201cAnd now we are heading to invented-in-China.\u201d  The company is cooperating with Volkswagen AG\u2019s Audi; Chongqing Changan Automobile Co., the local partner of Ford Motor Co.; and parts supplier Robert Bosch GmbH to get inside future autonomous vehicles.

Photographer: Giulia Marchi/Bloomberg  In an industry where the number of LEDs in a brake light is scrutinized for impact on gas mileage, processing data from laser, radar and camera sensors without draining an electric battery poses an enormous challenge for chipmakers.  \u201cWhat we are seeking is a horse that can run fast and long but eats as little as possible,\u201d Yu said. \u201cIf the embedded vehicle chip consumes too much power, it will lead to a burning car rather than a running car.\u201d  Audi selected Horizon Robotics for a China-specific project and will evaluate the outcome before taking any next steps, Johanna Barth, a Beijing-based spokeswoman for Audi, said without elaborating.  Audi still uses Nvidia and Mobileye sensors in cars sold outside China, she said.  Nvidia, based in Santa Clara, California, has recorded revenue growth of more than 20 percent for the last seven quarters, partly because of increasing demand for autonomous vehicles. It teamed with Baidu to develop an autonomous-vehicle platform, with plans to install that in cars made by Chery Automobile Co.  \u201cWe are working with Chinese automakers and the Chinese ecosystem, as well as global automakers that sell vehicles in China,\u201d said Danny Shapiro, senior director of automotive at Nvidia.  One of those customers is Tusimple Inc., a Beijing-based startup developing self-driving trucks. Tusimple, set to start commercial operation of truck fleets in Arizona and Shanghai next year, is backed by investors including Nvidia.  \u201cWe are satisfied with Nvidia\u2019s chip, which has the strongest computing power for self-driving solutions,\u201d said Hou Xiaodi, Tusimple\u2019s chief technology officer.  Jerusalem-based Mobileye, bought by Intel last year for $15 billion, provides image sensing and processing technology for driver-assistance features. It wants to expand in China through its fourth-generation EyeQ chip and a mapping system called Road Experience Management, said Danielle Mann, a spokeswoman for Intel.  Mobileye will bring the mapping system to China via partnerships with SAIC Motor Corp. and Beijing-based digital map provider NavInfo Co.  Yet, China has the money and commitment to make itself a force in semiconductor development, just as it\u2019s doing now with electric vehicles.  China\u2019s industrial priorities include becoming a leader in advanced manufacturing businesses, including integrated circuits, 5G mobile communications, aircraft engines and new-energy vehicles, Premier Li Keqiang told the National People\u2019s Congress on March 5.  The government envisions spending about $150 billion in the next decade.  \u201cAll major governments around the world are deploying all kinds of resources in policies, talents and capital to upgrade their industries,\u201d Tsinghua University\u2019s Wei said. \u201cAnd China is no exception.\u201d  \u2014 With assistance by Yan Zhang, Ian King, Yuan Gao, and Ville Heiskanen", "stock": "INTC", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-25", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-25/china-seeks-its-own-brains-to-steer-30-million-autonomous-cars"}, {"article": "Car2Go and DriveNow were both originally started as ventures with established vehicle-rental companies, but Stuttgart-based Daimler and Munich-based BMW each bought out the other owners this year, setting the stage for a tie-up.

Both carmakers raised full-year profit forecasts, saying earnings are likely to increase slightly if they can complete the deal in 2018, versus earlier predictions of flat figures.  The merger would allow Daimler and BMW to share the risk of operating in a tech-focused industry that includes a growing suite of rivals in mobility services.

His briefings of Apple breakthroughs over the years were legendary, and featured huge visuals behind him as he paced the stage. He was not just an innovator but also a master communicator. When I had to give addresses back in my military days, I would dive into Carmine Gallo\u2019s \u201cThe Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs\u201d for inspiration.  Watching Russian President Vladimir Putin roll out a similar display of fearsome new weapons at his state of the federation speech the other day had the distinct feeling of watching a Steve Jobs-style brief put together by \"Q,\" the gadget-loving quartermaster from MI6, in a twisted James Bond movie. But this bag of tricks is neither a new iPhone nor an Aston Martin with machine guns, or even an exploding pen. Putin was talking about nuclear weapons moving toward the U.S. on a variety of new platforms. How seriously should we take this?  Let\u2019s put aside that the video's special effects seemed straight from a 1990s video game, and start with the purported weapons themselves. In each case, U.S. intelligence has been tracking the development of these systems over the past decade. There is a nuclear-tipped and nuclear-powered torpedo; a new generation intercontinental ballistic missile with longer ranges; a nuclear-powered cruise missile that could theoretically fly more or less forever and attack the U.S. from any location; an air-launched high-speed cruise missile; and a hypersonic glide missile capable of flying 20 times the speed of sound. He also mentioned new laser systems to deploy against U.S. weapons. He described several of the weapons as \u201cinvincible.\u201d  His motivation in hyping these systems is threefold. First, in the \u201call politics is local\u201d category, he has an election coming up on March 18. While he is predictably and comfortably in the lead in all the polls (fairly easy to do when your opponents are assassinated or jailed and you have complete media control), he still wants to play to his base, as the saying goes. Russians, like people everywhere, enjoy nothing so much as a big spectacle on a huge stage. Add to that a good bashing of Russia\u2019s enemy No. 1, and you have a sure winner.  Second, Putin is communicating with his circle of dictatorial allies and partners around the world. His message to Bashar al-Assad in Syria, Kim Jung Un in North Korea, and the ayatollahs in Iran (can you spell \u201caxis of evil\u201d?) is one of reassurance that someone can stand up to the U.S. in terms of global deterrence and high-end military technology. The demonstration is also a good way to enhance the sales of Russian weapons systems globally -- its producers are currently the second-largest supplier of weapons in the world and would love to surpass the U.S. Indeed, Russia exports as much as Germany, France and the U.K. combined, and triple what China sells globally.  Finally, Putin is sending a very direct signal to Washington. He hates U.S. and Western interference with Russia at any level, from the sanctions over the invasion of Ukraine and annexation of Crimea to the Olympic punishments meted out after the massive doping scandal. The intent here is simple and brutal: We are a nuclear power and can destroy your nation. The fact that the U.S. can do the same to Russia is not lost on Putin, but he will never miss a chance to remind the U.S. that Russia has an equally lethal nuclear arsenal.  In terms of serious military capability, last week's demonstration was a mixed bag. Nothing he displayed represented either a shock to the U.S. intelligence community or a significant change in the existing balance of nuclear and conventional power. Several of the systems have not been demonstrated publically, nor put into serious production. The most worrisome over time is probably the nuclear torpedo, but the idea of a Russian first-strike remains extremely remote. And it is hard to envision a scenario in which the U.S. decides to strike Russia. The odds are extremely high that we will continue along with the same deterrent regime that has kept the nuclear peace since the end of World War II: mutual assured destruction.  In terms of policy issues, Putin's display of braggadocio underscores several important points. First is that stepping up the U.S. conventional force posture in Europe is going to be critical to deterring Russia from using these kinds of weapons to threaten the Europeans. For a start, this means having a full four U.S. brigade combat teams in place and permanently stationed in Europe. We also must continue to push NATO allies to up their game in terms of forces that are combat-ready.  It also emphasizes the importance of avoiding an escalation on both sides, in terms of producing and deploying low-yield nuclear weapons, which could very quickly intensify in a tense scenario and cause Russia to use one of these strategic weapons -- what analysts refer to as the \"escalate to de-escalate\" doctrine. Finally, it will require the Pentagon to develop comparable systems to maintain deterrence, particularly hyper-sonic nuclear-tipped cruise missiles, where Russian progress is outstripping out own.  Another striking aspect of Putin's presentation was his hyper-vitriolic tone, even compared to his previous stridency on such occasions. Given that he will in all likelihood remain Russia's leader for life, we should pay significant attention to the uber-aggressive style of the display. It is hard to imagine any U.S. president in modern history, including even the current incumbent, depicting nuclear attacks on Russia on a large-screen display. It screams of a man desperate for respect, and such men can be very dangerous over time -- especially if they hold a relatively weak overall hand of cards.  And Putin does: Russia has profound demographic problems (also alluded to in Putin\u2019s speech); serious environmental challenges; a struggling economy highly concentrated on hydrocarbons; and few real allies in the world. In many ways, we should worry more about Russian weakness than Russian strength.  For the U.S., the best move with Russia remains simple and transactional: confront where we must (Ukraine, Syria, cyber-intrusions); but cooperate where we can. The latter includes counter-narcotics, counter-piracy, counterterrorism, Afghanistan, the Arctic and other mutual concerns. And there are reasonable \u201cTrack 2\u201d diplomatic options for the nations, such as exchanges between academic institutions, think tanks, laboratories and commercial entities.  We are not quite yet in a new Cold War, but it isn\u2019t hard to see one shimmering in the near distance. Most worrisome of all, U.S. and Russian military forces are in combat in close proximity in Syria, and we are watching our military jets and warships maneuvering at close quarters in the Black and Baltic Seas. We are one significant tactical mistake away from stumbling into real danger. Leaders on both sides need to take a deep breath and encourage their subordinates to do the same.

The chipmaker\u2019s latest regulatory run-in was with the European Union\u2019s antitrust body, which fined Qualcomm 997 million euros ($1.2 billion) for paying one of its customers, Apple Inc., to agree to use only Qualcomm\u2019s chips in its iPhones and iPads from 2011 to 2016. The EU antitrust authority said Qualcomm\u2019s arrangement amounted to an improper abuse of market power. Qualcomm said it disagreed with the EU decision and planned to appeal.  It\u2019s a familiar pattern for corporations. Governments tend to wade in when big technology companies become overwhelmingly powerful in their fields. It has happened to Microsoft, Intel and Google to varying degrees. The steely gaze of governments now seems to be turning to Facebook.  The distractions, financial penalties and expensive regulatory and legal skirmishes are the inevitable costs of market power, and Qualcomm knows this well by now. It has clashed with government authorities in South Korea, China, the U.S., and other countries over claims that Qualcomm abuses its dominance in the market for important smartphone components.  When the Chips Are Down Qualcomm's stock is trading below Broadcom's takeover offer of $70 a share, indicating doubts Broadcom can pull off the transaction Source: Bloomberg  Oddly, Qualcomm is now in a position where the government scrutiny helps its cause. Among Qualcomm\u2019s efforts to ward off an unwanted takeover attempt by fellow chipmaker Broadcom Ltd., the company has argued that regulators wouldn\u2019t clear the deal or that regulatory compromises would be too onerous. Yes, on the one hand Qualcomm has been fighting claims that it abuses its market power. And on the other, its size and market power help support Qualcomm's case against a Broadcom takeover.  Qualcomm's concerns are valid. If Broadcom and Qualcomm combine, the company would be the third-largest chipmaker in the world by revenue, behind Intel and Samsung. Broadcom has said that the companies' businesses don't overlap much, but the sheer size would certainly invite regulatory doubts.  And Broadcom has argued -- without much elaboration-- that it will be able to tackle Qualcomm\u2019s continuing government challenges by overhauling Qualcomm\u2019s contentious business model, which generates most of the company's operating profit from licensing patents. Apple and some of the government authorities have said that business model is a way for Qualcomm to overcharge customers.  Flexing Muscles If Broadcom acquires Qualcomm, the combined company would be the world's third-largest chipmaker by revenue Source: Bloomberg  One question is what customers think of the possible creation of an even more hefty chip supplier. The Wall Street Journal reported this month that three leading Chinese smartphone manufacturers are concerned about the Broadcom-Qualcomm deal because they worry a combination would result in higher prices for essential chips. In a rebuttal on Tuesday, Broadcom said that any antitrust concerns could be resolved and that Broadcom\u2019s customers supported an acquisition of Qualcomm.  It can't be fun for Qualcomm (or its stockholders) to see billions of dollars fly out of its coffers to mollify regulators. But Qualcomm must be smiling a little that government watchdogs are also helping the company's case against a takeover.

The flaws have rocked the tech world since Google engineers wrote a detailed description of the flaws on January 3. The vulnerabilities affect every major CPU maker, but Intel has taken the brunt of the impact as its chips are affected more than others.  The flaws are especially worrisome because they were built into Intel's hardware, making fixes to existing chips more challenging, but the company said it would begin shipping chips without the flaws later this year.  \"We've been working around clock,\" Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said. \"We're acutely aware we have more to do.\"  Intel did not detail the potential financial impacts of the flaws in its report, but analysts weren't really expecting the company to.  \"While Meltdown/Spectre could cause purchases to be postponed in 1H, it still too early to tell, and we doubt INTC will guide to such an event for fear of driving a self-fulfilling prophecy,\" John Pitzer, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said before the report.

Apple's reported plans to ditch Intel's processing chips in favor of its own has the potential to wipe billions of dollars of revenue from the chipmaker.

The guidelines come amid scrutiny of a massive stock sale Intel CEO Brian Krzanich made last fall after his company found out about \u2014 but before it publicly disclosed \u2014 the Meltdown and Spectre attacks.  The agency advised companies to disclose such incidents to investors in a \"timely\" manner.  It also warned executives and directors not to trade in their companies shares in the time in between finding out about a \"material\" security problem and disclosing it to the public.  Intel CEO Brian Krzanich sold millions of dollars worth of company stock after his company became aware of the Spectre and Meltdown security vulnerabilities, but before they became public.  The Securities and Exchange Commission has a bit of advice for other executives thinking of doing something similar: Don't.  In new guidelines issued on Wednesday, the agency warned that security breaches and vulnerabilities could constitute \"material\" information, noting that it's illegal under US securities laws for insiders to trade stocks based on such information before it becomes public. Such sales may also violate companies' ethics and insider trading policies.  \"Directors, officers, and other corporate insiders must not trade a public company's securities while in possession of material nonpublic information, which may include knowledge regarding a significant cybersecurity incident experienced by the company,\" the SEC said in the guidelines.  It continued: \"Companies should have policies and procedures in place to [...] guard against directors, officers, and other corporate insiders taking advantage of the period between the company's discovery of a cybersecurity incident and public disclosure of the incident to trade on material nonpublic information.\"  Additionally, the SEC encouraged companies to disclose security breaches and vulnerabilities to investors in a \"timely fashion.\"  The new guidelines follow disclosures of the Meltdown and Spectre attacks  The guidelines come less than two months after Intel and other tech companies disclosed the Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities. Those vulnerabilities, which take advantage of a feature found in nearly all computer processors, could be used in cyberattacks that would allow malicious actors to steal private data stored on computers, such as passwords.  The exploits were of particular concern to Intel. The vulnerability they take advantage of has been present in nearly all Intel chips for the last 20 years. And while just about all processors found in smartphones, tablets, and PCs are vulnerable to the Spectre attack, few chips other than Intel's are at risk of the Meltdown attack.  Intel was notified of the attacks in June, but waited some seven months to disclose them. In between the company becoming aware of the processor security problems, and their public disclosure, Krzanich gained $24 million by selling all of the shares and options he was allowed to sell under his contract.  The company has said his stock sale was unrelated to the Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities, noting that it was done as part of a planned stock sale. But Krzanich put that plan in place just the month before \u2014 some five months after Intel became aware of the Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities.  Intel is facing some 35 lawsuits related to Spectre and Meltdown  Intel's handling of the disclosure of the exploits is now the subject of some 35 lawsuits, including a pair of shareholder derivative suits specifically related to Krzanich's stock sale.  Similar questions were raised about stock sales by Equifax executives made last year, in between the company becoming aware of a massive security breach and it disclosing that breach to the public.  It's unclear whether the SEC's new guidelines were prompted by either the Equifax or Intel security issues. The Justice Department is reportedly investigating the stock sales at Equifax. It's unclear whether the department or the SEC is investigating Krzanich's sale.  The guidelines don't represent new rules. Instead, they're essentially a clarification of existing ones. As such, the fact that the agency didn't issue them until Wednesday wouldn't bar it from investigating Krzanich's sale, even though that sale predated those guidelines.

At least one shareholder suit is taking aim at alleged insider trading at Intel; questions have been raised about a massive stock sale by the company's CEO after Intel was informed of the attacks but before it disclosed them to the public.  The Spectre and Meltdown attacks were a public relations nightmare for Intel. Now they've become a legal headache as well.  The chip making giant, its board members, and executives face 35 lawsuits related to the attacks, the company disclosed in its annual report on Friday.

The attacks were actually discovered in June, and Intel was made aware of them soon thereafter. The vulnerability the attacks exploit has been present in nearly all Intel chips made over the last 20 years. And, unlike chips made by other manufacturers, Intel's processors are vulnerable to both Spectre and Meltdown.  Intel's handling of Spectre and Meltdown has drawn criticism \u2014 and now lawsuits  Intel's handling of the situation has raised eyebrows not just because it waited more than six months to disclose the attacks to the public despite the fact that its chips were particularly at risk of them, but also because of a massive stock sale made by company CEO Brian Krzanich after the company found out about the attacks. In sale \u2014 through which Krzanich saw a $24 million windfall \u2014 the CEO sold off all of the shares of Intel he was allowed to sell under his contract.  Intel has noted that the sale, which Krzanich made in November, was done as part of a planned stock divestiture. But Krzanich only put that plan in place a month earlier, which was more than four months after Intel became aware of the attacks.  Thirty of the lawsuits filed against Intel are seeking class action status and were filed by customers who claim they were harmed by the attacks or by the company's failure to disclose them, according to the annual report. Two of the suits, also seeking class action status, were filed on behalf of shareholders who charge that the disclosure of the attacks shows that statements Intel made about its products or business were false or misleading.  Additionally, another three Intel investors have filed shareholder derivative suits in California state court, according to the annual report.

Amid the scramble, Intel, the company most affected by the flaws, has seen its stock price slump.  But, as the company prepares to report earnings soon, one analyst thinks the company will be fine in the near term.  Watch Intel's stock price move in real time here.    Spectre and Meltdown, arguably the two biggest flaws ever found in modern computers, might not have a big impact on the near-term earnings of Intel, the company hit the hardest by the flaws.  At least, that's the thinking of John Pitzer, an analyst at Credit Suisse.  \"While our calendar first quarter estimates embed NO negative impact to revenue from the Meltdown/Spectre security issues \u2013 near term we would highlight that the uncertainty created could cause at least some calendar first quarter server/client purchases to be deferred as IT managers look for more clarity,\" Pitzer said in a note to clients.  Spectre and Meltdown are flaws in a technique modern CPUs use to speed up computing. There are three total variations of the two flaws, and Intel is the only company whose chips have been reported to be affected by all three. The company has seen its share price decline about 8.73% so far this year after the flaws were disclosed publicly.  Pizter previously released a report the day after the flaws were disclosed that claimed everyone was making \"mountains from molehills\" regarding the flaws. A lot of new information about the flaws has surfaced since then, but Pizter is holding his ground, saying Intel's near-term revenue largely won't be affected.  There have been confusing and conflicting reports around the flaws since their public disclosure, however. AMD, which is Intel's main rival in the space, initially said its hardware would not be affected by the flaws, and later reversed its stance. Nvidia, which makes GPUs, created confusion when it issued Spectre and Meltdown patches for its products which were thought to be impervious to the flaws. Nvidia later clarified that its patches were only precautionary, and its products are not affected.  Patches to fix CPUs affected by the flaws were initially thought to slow down certain programs by as much as 30%, and an exact impact on performance has yet to be determined. Pitzer said IT managers and big data centers could delay planned purchases of Intel chips until more clarity is found, and the long-term effects of the flaws for chipmakers won't be evident for some time.  If certain companies' chips are found to be faster than others after all the final Spectre and Meltdown patches have been issued, there could be a sector-wide shift to the faster chips, Pitzer said.  Pizter has a \"neutral\" rating on Intel, but said it's mostly because he thinks the company is too expensive right now, not because of the potential risks associated with Spectre and Meltdown.  Intel reports fourth quarter earnings January 25, and Pitzer thinks the results will fall in line with Wall Street's expectations. Pizter is expecting earnings per share of $0.86 on revenue of $16.3 billion.

About 56% of the analysts surveyed by Bloomberg are bullish on the stock, while the other 43% are neutral or bearish.  Wall Street is perhaps more hesitant because of the uncertainty around recent security flaws that affect Intel chips. The company has been working to fix a decade's worth of security issues with its processors, dubbed Spectre and Meltdown. The recently disclosed security issues allow bad actors to exploit the way modern CPUs work to find sensitive information they wouldn't normally have access to. All the major CPU makers are affected by the flaws, but Intel has been hit the hardest.  When news of the flaws initially broke, investors flocked to Intel's rival, AMD, sending shares of the company up 16.29% this year. It's a stark contrast to Intel's shares which have slipped about 4%.  Ahead of the company's fourth-quarter earnings report, set to be released after the bell on Thursday, Wall Street is expecting adjusted earnings of $0.87 per share on revenue of $16.347 billion, according to data from Bloomberg.  Investors will likely be watching for comments on how the Spectre and Meltdown patches are coming along, and for more clarity about the flaws' impact on the company's business. Some analysts think it will likely impact the first quarter of 2018, but only because major chip buyers will delay their purchases until more clarity is found.

Mr. Ditzel helped popularize many of the same ideas and is now building a new RISC chip at a start-up called Esperanto.  Photo  Mr. Patterson and Mr. Hennessy were interested in simpler chips because they ran faster, consumed less power, made life easier for chip designers and allowed machines to evolve at a faster rate. In the mid-1980s, new RISC chips emerged from two Silicon Valley start-ups, Sun Microsystems and MIPS Technologies, becoming the standard for the computer workstations and servers that underpinned big corporate operations.  Those processors were eventually eclipsed by chips from Intel, which put its considerable muscle behind a competing design. But as computing expanded into smartphones, tablets, and other small devices \u2014 where power and space are at a premium \u2014 more and more chips used designs from a British company called ARM, short for Advanced RISC Machine.  As a book written by the two researchers in 1989, Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach, became the standard text for chip design, even Intel took a partial step toward the RISC idea. Its chips continued to use their own complex way of talking to a computer\u2019s software, but started to use some aspects of RISC.

But as these chips approach their physical limits, internet giants like Google, Facebook, and Amazon are pushing tasks onto a wide range of simpler processors that consume much less power, sparking a renaissance in chip design.  \u201cComplexity is even more of an enemy than it was before,\u201d Mr. Ditzel said. \u201cWe have to design differently.\u201d  Mr. Patterson and Mr. Hennessy are at the heart of this change. Their book is now in its sixth edition. Mr. Hennessy is on the board of directors of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, after serving as the president of Stanford for 16 years. And Mr. Patterson works in the Google research lab that is designing low-powered chips specifically for artificial intelligence.

The people familiar with the Democratic document say that it reveals that while the F.B.I. did not name the Democratic National Committee and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign as having funded the Steele research, the bureau disclosed to the court that the information it had received from him was politically motivated. That, the Democratic memo says, gave the judge in the case the information he needed to make a decision about its usefulness.

Beijing swung into action. It banned government offices from installing the most recent version of Microsoft Windows, and antitrust investigators raided Microsoft\u2019s offices. Cisco, Apple and Intel products were removed from state lists that officials use as guides when buying equipment. Qualcomm got slapped with a $975 million fine for anticompetitive behavior.

Data in motion and the cloud are much harder to deal with.\u201d  The deliberations shed new light on public remarks by Trump administration officials in recent months. In October, Mr. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, argued in a speech that permitting technology companies to create \u201cwarrant-proof encryption\u201d was endangering society.  \u201cTechnology companies almost certainly will not develop responsible encryption if left to their own devices,\u201d he said. \u201cCompetition will fuel a mind-set that leads them to produce products that are more and more impregnable. That will give criminals and terrorists more opportunities to cause harm with impunity.\u201d  And Mr. Wray, the F.B.I. director, has twice given speeches this year in which he pointed to Symphony, an encrypted messaging system for banks. Pushed by a state regulator, several banks agreed to give copies of their Symphony keys to law firms. Because Symphony keeps a copy of encrypted data on its servers, that arrangement created a backup means for investigators to gain access to the messages if necessary.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  \u201cAt the end, the data in Symphony was still secure, still encrypted, but also accessible to the regulators so they could do their jobs,\u201d Mr. Wray told a cybersecurity conference in Boston this month. \u201cI\u2019m confident that by working together and finding similar areas to agree and compromise, we can come up with solutions to the \u2018going dark\u2019 problem.\u201d  The Symphony approach, however, would not work for millions of ordinary smartphone users. But one alternative being worked on by Mr. Ozzie and others is receiving particular attention inside the government.  The idea is that when devices encrypt themselves, they would generate a special access key that could unlock their data without the owner\u2019s passcode. This electronic key would be stored on the device itself, inside part of its hard drive that would be separately encrypted \u2014 so that only the manufacturer, in response to a court order, could open it.  Law enforcement officials see that idea as attractive in part because companies like Apple are already trusted to securely hold special keys permitting them to push operating system updates to devices like iPhones.  Still, Ms. Landau argued that creating such a system would create significant additional security risks. She noted, among other things, that updates are relatively rare but police would want seized phones opened every day \u2014 so many more tech company employees would need access to the powerful new keys, increasing the risk of theft or abuse.  The Obama administration never agreed on asking for legislation mandating access mechanisms. Military and cybersecurity agencies worried that weakening security would create new problems, and commerce officials worried about quashing innovation and making American tech products less competitive.  Still, in 2016, the Obama administration\u2019s deliberations also came to focus on the idea of access keys on devices, a participant said, but stalled because of difficult technical questions about the details. They included how to prevent criminals from deleting the access keys on their devices or from using phones that do not have the mechanism because they run on outdated software or were built for foreign markets.  But one Justice Department official familiar with the deliberations contended that it might not be necessary to come up with a foolproof system, arguing that a solution that would work for ordinary, less-savvy criminals was still worth pursuing.  Mr. Brickell, the former Intel official, echoed that view. Enforcing compliance with a rule that devices must have access mechanisms to function \u201cis a difficult problem,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s keep working on it.

Ms. Sanders referred questions about the security clearance process \u2014 and why Mr. Porter was allowed to continue working at the White House for so long despite the abuse accusations \u2014 to the F.B.I. and the intelligence agencies, saying they are the ones that handle the background checks and the granting of permission to handle classified information.  \u201cIt\u2019s up to those same law enforcement and intelligence agencies to determine if changes need to be made to their process,\u201d she said.  The F.B.I. had no comment on Monday.  The finger-pointing has frustrated Democratic members of Congress, who have pushed to gain visibility into the security clearance procedure at the White House.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina and the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, has refused to ask the White House for any information about security clearances or for a formal briefing on the matter, Democrats on the panel said Monday. He has also refused to allow the committee to vote on three subpoenas proposed by Democrats, including one on interim clearances.  Mr. Gowdy\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment.  In a letter sent last week, Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the top Democrat on the committee, pressed Mr. Gowdy to more aggressively tackle the security clearance issue, saying that news of Mr. Porter\u2019s problems had given the matter renewed urgency.  \u201cIf you had agreed to any of our previous requests for information on these matters, the White House would have been required to answer key questions about why Mr. Porter was denied a final security clearance,\u201d Mr. Cummings wrote.  \u201cInstead, because of your multiple refusals, we did not find out about any of these issues until they were reported in the press,\u201d he added.  The process for allowing White House officials to work with secret, classified material typically begins when West Wing employees are subjected to a brief background check and are granted interim clearance. A full background check by the F.B.I. and, in some cases, the C.I.A. then begins.  Officials with previous administrations said it is not uncommon for the full background checks to take as long as eight months or a year, in part because of a long backlog in vetting the backgrounds of people needing clearance across the federal government.  Video  Background checks take about a year for Pentagon employees and six to seven months for prospective C.I.A. or National Security Agency workers, a senior American official said.  But several former White House officials said it is also common for administration officials to encourage the investigators to give top priority to senior presidential aides like Mr. Porter and Mr. Kushner.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  What Mr. McGahn and other top White House officials learned about the allegations against Mr. Porter, and when they learned it, remains murky.  Mr. Porter told Mr. McGahn in January 2017 that there could be what he described as false allegations against him, according to two people briefed on the situation. In June, the F.B.I. informed the White House security office that allegations of domestic abuse had surfaced. Mr. McGahn was made aware at the time that there was an issue with Mr. Porter\u2019s background investigation, but relied on the security office to continue pursuing the background check.  White House officials disputed that assertion, saying on Monday that Mr. McGahn was not made aware during the summer of any problems with Mr. Porter\u2019s clearance.  In November, the bureau delivered a thick file on Mr. Porter\u2019s background check to the security office and relayed that he was not likely to succeed in getting a permanent clearance, according to one person briefed on the case. Security office officials encouraged the F.B.I. to complete its investigation so the office could make a final determination on Mr. Porter\u2019s clearance.  One person briefed on the situation, who had insisted on anonymity to discuss private deliberations, said late last week that the bureau had informed Mr. McGahn when the file was delivered that the allegations against Mr. Porter were likely to derail his security clearance. But on Monday, the person said that he had been mistaken, and contended that Mr. McGahn had not learned of the F.B.I.\u2019s communications to the security office until much later.  In Mr. Kushner\u2019s case, a final decision about a permanent security clearance is also still pending.  Mr. Lowell said that it should not be surprising that someone with \u201cthe extent of his holdings, travels and lengthy submissions\u201d would require a lengthy background check. But he took issue with the suggestion that the delays somehow affect Mr. Kushner\u2019s ability to do his job at the White House.  \u201cThis is just the latest,\u201d he said, \u201cin unnamed sources quoting secondhand hearsay concerning Mr. Kushner that, like the others, will be shown to be untrue.\u201d", "stock": "INTC", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-13", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/12/us/politics/white-house-security-clearances-jared-kushner.html"}, {"article": "Intel and Qualcomm are fierce rivals and Intel has been working to chip away at Qualcomm\u2019s strong position in making equipment for wireless devices, namely those from Apple Inc. Qualcomm and Apple have been in a bitter licensing dispute and Apple lately has switched to Intel chips in a portion of its devices. Should Broadcom succeed in buying Qualcomm, it could smooth over relations with Apple, closing a door to further possible gains from Intel.  A Broadcom deal would be Intel\u2019s biggest acquisition by far\u2014and should it pursue one, there is no guarantee regulators would bless it. Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., and with a market value of nearly $240 billion, has been acquisitive in recent years as it looks to diversify away from its core business of powering the personal-computer industry, which is in decline.  Last year, Intel bought Israeli car-camera pioneer Mobileye NV for roughly $15.3 billion in a bet on connected cars. In 2015, it struck its largest deal ever when it bought Altera Corp. for $16.7 billion. Intel hoped that buying Altera, a maker of programmable chips, would help bolster its position in server systems and other equipment found in data centers and telecommunications networks, the company said at the time, as well as fuel its plans surrounding the so-called Internet of Things.  In the most recent piece of drama surrounding Broadcom\u2019s bid to buy Qualcomm, the effort was dealt a setback when the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or CFIUS, indicated it has concerns about the takeover and would review it.  That appeared to lengthen the odds that Broadcom and its chief executive, Hock Tan, would succeed in their pursuit of Qualcomm, which has rejected the $117 billion offer as too low.  Separately, Qualcomm has in place its own pending $44 billion deal to buy NXP Semiconductors NV, which it sweetened in February, a move Broadcom criticized.  Qualcomm and Broadcom unleashed dueling announcements Friday as each sought to win support from regulators and shareholders during the takeover fight.  Qualcomm, looking to assert its board\u2019s independence, said Paul Jacobs would no longer be executive chairman. Mr. Jacobs, the son of Qualcomm co-founder Irwin Jacobs, will remain on the board. Current board member Jeffrey Henderson was named nonexecutive chairman.  Broadcom has been seeking to replace a majority of Qualcomm\u2019s board members to help pave the way for a deal. A vote on the directors that was slated to take place this past Tuesday at Qualcomm\u2019s annual meeting was pushed back a month at CFIUS\u2019s behest.  Broadcom, meanwhile, pledged that if it succeeds in acquiring its target, it wouldn\u2019t sell \u201cany critical national security assets to any foreign companies.\u201d The assurance was a nod to U.S. concerns that a takeover could weaken Qualcomm\u2019s position\u2014and therefore the country\u2019s standing\u2014as a leader in developing next-generation 5G cellular technology.  Broadcom late Friday said it will ask shareholders to vote March 23 to approve the company\u2019s plan to redomicile from Singapore to the U.S., potentially setting the stage for a showdown with CFIUS as the vote would take place in the middle of the panel\u2019s review of Broadcom\u2019s bid.  If Broadcom were considered a U.S. company, its acquisition would arguably fall outside of the panel\u2019s jurisdiction, though CFIUS could say it still has jurisdiction to review the bid since it began the review while Broadcom was a Singapore company.  Should Broadcom fail in its bid for Qualcomm, it is possible Intel would stand down, happy with the status quo.  Underlying the maneuvering is a battle among chip companies to be the chief supplier of critical cellular components to smartphone makers such as Apple and Samsung Electronics Co.  Qualcomm is a leader in chips that run apps and manage cellular communications in smartphones. It competes with Broadcom in chips for short-range wireless networking, including Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, and radio filters and other chips that condition cellular signals.  Intel, which dominates the market for the calculating engines in personal computers and data-center servers, missed the mobile revolution when its chips proved too power-hungry for battery-dependent cellphones. But Intel\u2019s cellular communications chips lately have displaced Qualcomm\u2019s in a portion of Apple\u2019s iPhones, and the company has been moving aggressively to develop that product line.  Acquiring Broadcom would give Intel a suite of smartphone chips, adding to its own communications chips the Singapore-based company\u2019s radio filters as well as Bluetooth and GPS components.  Broadcom sells a diverse line of equipment for networking and communications\u2014including technology for smartphones from Apple and Samsung\u2014as well as data storage, electronic displays and set-top boxes. Broadcom, like Qualcomm, is a so-called fabless chip company, designing processors while relying on manufacturers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to actually make them.  Under Mr. Tan, Broadcom has pursued a string of acquisitions. The company was formed when Avago Technologies Ltd. in 2015 agreed to buy the former Broadcom for roughly $37 billion and kept its name. Broadcom\u2019s revenue was twice the size of Avago\u2019s at the time of the merger.

INTC -1.63% reported record growth in fourth-quarter revenue as sales in its data-center business jumped 20%, while the company swung to a quarterly loss as it booked a $5.4 billion charge after recent changes in U.S. tax law.  Overall revenue rose 4% to $17.05 billion. Intel reported a $687 million loss, compared with a profit of $3.56 billion a year earlier, largely because of the tax impact.  The company said it expects a 2018 tax rate of 14%, compared with an adjusted rate of 23% in 2017, which doesn\u2019t account for the tax impact.  The chip giant also announced a 10% rise in its annual dividend to $1.20 a share.  Sales in the division responsible for server chips and other data-center gear\u2014a critical area as personal-computer sales wane\u2014climbed to $5.6 billion. That pushed full-year growth in the segment to 11%, above Intel\u2019s goal of high single-digit growth for 2017.  In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Intel finance chief Bob Swan attributed the growth to demand from cloud vendors and communications networks, as well as surprisingly strong sales to corporate data centers, which had been sluggish.  \u201cWe saw strong customer demand for high-performance products across the board,\u201d he said. He cautioned, however, he doesn\u2019t expect the rising pace of sales to corporate customers to continue.  Intel\u2019s report Thursday came as the company continues to work on closing recently disclosed security holes in virtually all its processors.  The company has said that it doesn\u2019t expect the security flaws to affect its finances, but questions linger about just how seriously customers are affected, especially those that operate large data centers, and what redress they might demand. At the outset of the company\u2019s conference call with analysts, Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said Intel is working around the clock to fix the flaws, but conceded that \u201cwhile we\u2019ve made progress, I am acutely aware that we have more to do.\u201d  In the personal-computer division, where Intel faces stepped up competition from Advanced Micro Devices Inc., sales fell 2%, in line with the quarter\u2019s drop in PC shipments tallied by industry researcher Gartner Inc.  Intel has been trimming costs to keep margins up as it transitions from PCs to a broader technology portfolio. It has pledged to bring annual operating expenses to 30% of revenue by 2020. In the quarter, it cut those costs to 31% of revenue, compared with 34% in the year-earlier period and averaging 33.7% for the year.  The company also posted strong growth in some areas where it has been seeking to expand its market, though the businesses for now are much smaller than PC and data-center chips.  Sales of programmable chips, which can be reconfigured on the fly, were up 35%, while sales of chips for a variety of items known as the Internet of Things, were up 21%. Memory, where Intel is investing heavily, achieved profitability, Intel said, though sales growth slowed to 9%, a slightly steeper drop than some analysts expected.  Intel shares were up 3.5% after hours, having fallen 0.5% to $45.30 in regular New York trading. Through Thursday\u2019s close, the stock was up 29% since late July, when surging second-quarter revenue and profit sparked investor confidence that the company could overcome its challenges.  The company\u2019s forecast for the current year was for profit of about $3.55 a share on an adjusted basis, on revenue of about $65 billion, compared with $3.46 a share in adjusted profit and $62.8 billion in revenue for 2017.  Intel reported per-share earnings of $1.08 for the quarter on an adjusted basis, which excludes the tax-law impact and other items such as restructuring and acquisition-related costs. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had expected adjusted profit of 86 cents a share on $16.35 billion in revenue.  \u2014Maria Armental contributed to this article.

INTC -1.63% is considering buying Broadcom Ltd. AVGO 3.14% , a company valued at more than $100 billion, shows the depth to which the chip giant feels threatened by a potential tie-up between Broadcom and its rival Qualcomm Inc. QCOM 0.96%  Since late last year, Intel has been exploring a bid for Broadcom to forestall that company\u2019s $117 billion offer for Qualcomm in what would be the biggest-ever tech deal, people familiar with the matter told The Wall Street Journal in an article published Friday. Intel\u2019s interest in derailing that deal reflects its worry that a combined Broadcom-Qualcomm, which would create the third-largest chip company by revenue after Intel and Samsung Electronics Co., would endanger its competitive position, the people said.  A merged Broadcom and Qualcomm would combine market-leading smartphone chips with a strong presence in data centers, two areas Intel has targeted for growth. And Qualcomm\u2019s own proposed purchase of Dutch automotive chip specialist NXP Semiconductors NV would turbocharge such a merger in the automotive market, where Intel has placed one of its biggest bets.  \u201cYou\u2019d have this powerhouse going up against you,\u201d said analyst Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein Research, noting the combined revenue of Broadcom and Qualcomm\u2014nearly $40 billion in fiscal 2017\u2014would be formidable even relative to Intel\u2019s $63 billion in the same year. Nonetheless, he finds an Intel-Broadcom merger unlikely.  There are several reasons why such a combination may not happen. Intel is weighing a range of alternative acquisitions, the Journal reported Friday, and a hostile Broadcom offer would present enormous challenges of financing, complexity and regulatory scrutiny.  Intel has made relatively few big deals in its 49-year history\u2014the largest was in 2015 when it acquired Altera Corp. for $16.7 billion\u2014and it has previously had a spotty track record of folding them in.  Intel in a statement said its focus is on integrating its recent purchases and \u201cmaking them successful for our customers and shareholders.\u201d The company declined to comment further.  An Intel-Broadcom tie-up may not even make sense in terms of strengthening Intel, according to some analysts. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any benefit to Intel,\u201d said Handel Jones, a consultant at International Business Strategies. In particular, he said, Broadcom\u2019s products wouldn\u2019t mesh well with Intel\u2019s manufacturing operations, where the chip giant could use additional volume to reduce costs.  But the prospect that Intel could bid for Broadcom reflects tectonic forces reshaping the semiconductor industry as chips make their way into all manner of consumer and industrial products, from smart speakers to urban infrastructure.  Intel, with a market capitalization of about $243 billion, holds over a 90% share in its core markets of processor chips in personal computers and data-center servers, according to Mercury Research, leaving it scant room to grow in those areas as PC shipments continue their persistent decline.  Intel has responded, in part, by moving aggressively into cellular communications chips, where it has replaced Qualcomm units in a portion of Apple Inc.\u2019s iPhones and made inroads with the next-generation 5G cellular specification.  It has advanced into the automotive industry with its $15.3 billion purchase of Mobileye NV, a leader in sensors for assisted-driving features like automated lane keeping and collision avoidance.  And it has doubled down on its data-center business, supplying companies like Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. that are spending tens of billions annually on hyperscale cloud-computing facilities.  Hitching Broadcom, whose management style has driven a sevenfold increase in its share price over five years, to Qualcomm, whose products form the bedrock of the mobile market, could threaten Intel\u2019s progress in all three areas.  Broadcom declined to comment. Qualcomm didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.  Qualcomm has focused on developing key cellular technology, playing a leadership role in 5G. That research keeps its chips ahead of the competition, and it has resulted in a patent portfolio that yields a royalty on nearly every smartphone sold, whether or not they contain Qualcomm chips\u2014a revenue stream that typically provides most of Qualcomm\u2019s pretax profit.  Since early 2017, though, Qualcomm has been in a bitter legal war with Apple over its royalty rates, which the iPhone maker alleges are unfair. Qualcomm hasn\u2019t been able to resolve the conflict quickly, and Apple is considering replacing Qualcomm chips entirely with products from rivals including Intel.  Broadcom also sells chips to Apple, and its chief executive, Hock Tan, claims to have a strong relationship with the iPhone maker. If Broadcom takes over Qualcomm, he believes he could resolve the Apple dispute. In that case, Apple could boost Qualcomm\u2019s presence in iPhones at Intel\u2019s expense, especially as 5G ramps up in coming years.  A combined Broadcom-Qualcomm also could wreak havoc on Intel\u2019s ambitions in self-driving cars. Qualcomm\u2019s acquisition of NXP awaits antitrust approval in China, its final regulatory hurdle, which Qualcomm has said it expects soon. Completing the purchase would pave the way for Qualcomm\u2019s 5G chips and self-driving tech. The extra heft that Broadcom would give that combination could create a counterweight to Intel and Mobileye.  Broadcom also sells switches to makers of data-center equipment, while Qualcomm is pushing into data centers with server processors that compete directly with Intel\u2019s. The prospect of selling Qualcomm\u2019s server chips through Broadcom\u2019s data-center channels may give Intel pause.  And Mr. Tan likely wouldn\u2019t stop there. He built Broadcom on a string of ever bolder acquisitions. Having rolled up Qualcomm\u2014if his takeover effort gets that far\u2014he could continue to enlarge his portfolio of market-leading franchises, potentially blocking Intel\u2019s efforts at every turn.  \u2014Dana Mattioli  and Dana Cimilluca contributed to this article.

Intel\u2019s decision to inform Chinese technology companies about security flaws in its processors raises concerns that the information could have reached the Chinese government before being publicly divulged. Photo: steinba/EPA/Shutterstock  In initial disclosures about critical security flaws discovered in its processors, Intel Corp. INTC -1.63% notified a small group of customers, including Chinese technology companies, but left out the U.S. government, according to people familiar with the matter and some of the companies involved.  The decision raises concerns, security researchers said, as it potentially could have allowed information about the chip flaws, dubbed Spectre and Meltdown, to fall into the hands of the Chinese government before being publicly divulged. There is no evidence any information was misused, the researchers said.  Weeks after word of the flaws first surfaced, Intel\u2019s choices about who would receive advance warning continue to ripple through the security and tech industries.  The flaws were first identified in June by a member of Google\u2019s Project Zero security team. Intel had planned to make the discovery public on Jan. 9\u2014people working to protect systems from hacks often hold off on announcements while fixes are devised\u2014but sped up its timetable when the news became widely known on Jan. 3, a day after U.K. website the Register wrote about the flaws.  Because the flaws can be leveraged to sneak sensitive data out of the cloud, information about them would be of great interest to any intelligence-gathering agency, said Jake Williams, president of the security company Rendition Infosec LLC and a former National Security Agency employee. In the past, Chinese state-linked hackers have exploited software vulnerabilities to get leverage on their targets or expand surveillance.  It is a \u201cnear certainty\u201d Beijing was aware of the conversations between Intel and its Chinese tech partners, because authorities there routinely monitor all such communications, Mr. Williams said.  Representatives from China\u2019s ministry in charge of information technology didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. The country\u2019s foreign ministry has in the past said it is \u201cresolutely opposed\u201d to cyberhacking in any form.  An Intel spokesman declined to identify the companies it briefed before the scheduled Jan. 9 announcement. The company wasn\u2019t able to tell everyone it had planned to, including the U.S. government, because the news was made public earlier than expected, he said.  Intel\u2019s tricky path\u2014inform enough big customers to head off significant damage while keeping the information as contained as possible to limit potential leaks\u2014continues to weigh on smaller companies that weren\u2019t given an early nod.  Joyent Inc., a U.S.-based cloud-services provider owned by Samsung Electronics Co. , is still playing catch-up, said Bryan Cantrill, the company\u2019s chief technology officer.  \u201cOther folks had a six-month head start,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re scrambling.\u201d  In the months before the flaws were publicly disclosed, Intel worked on fixes with Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google unit as well as \u201ckey\u201d computer makers and cloud-computing companies, Intel said in an emailed statement to The Wall Street Journal.  An official at the Department of Homeland Security said staffers learned of the chip flaws from the Jan. 3 news reports. The department is often informed of bug discoveries in advance of the public, and it acts as an authoritative source for information on how to address them.  \u201cWe certainly would have liked to have been notified of this,\u201d the official said.  The NSA was similarly in the dark, according to Rob Joyce, the White House\u2019s top cybersecurity official. In a message posted Jan. 13 to Twitter, he said the NSA \u201cdid not know about these flaws.\u201d A White House spokesman declined to comment further, referring instead to the tweet.  Chinese computer maker Lenovo Group Ltd. LNVGY -0.87% was among the large tech companies, including Microsoft Corp. , Amazon.com Inc. and ARM Holdings in the U.K., that were notified of the flaws beforehand.  Lenovo was able to issue a statement Jan. 3 advising customers on the flaws because of \u201cthe work we\u2019d done ahead of that date with industry processor and operating system partners,\u201d a spokeswoman said in an email.  Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA -2.21% , China\u2019s top seller of cloud-computing services, also was notified ahead of time, according to a person familiar with the company.  A spokeswoman for Alibaba\u2019s cloud unit declined to comment on when the company was informed. She said any idea that the company might have shared information with Chinese authorities was \u201cspeculative and baseless.\u201d  A Lenovo spokeswoman said Intel\u2019s information was protected by a nondisclosure agreement.  Despite the security concerns, an early heads up to a select number of large global companies made sense, said Dave Aitel, chief executive of Immunity Inc., a company that sells security services. \u201cThey\u2019re going to tell as few people as possible\u201d to contain possible leaks, he said.  Because they had early warning, Microsoft, Google and Amazon were able to release statements soon after news of the flaws leaked out saying their cloud-computing customers were largely protected.  Smaller competitors, though, continue to struggle. DigitalOcean Inc., a cloud-services seller, said Jan. 19 it was still testing a fix for its customers. Rackspace Inc. said last Wednesday it has several teams working on a fix. The cloud company earlier in January told customers it understood the situation \u201ccan be frustrating.\u201d  The DHS also stumbled with its initial guidance. The agency\u2019s Computer Emergency Response Team first linked to an advisory stating the only way to \u201cfully remove\u201d the flaws was by replacing the chip. CERT now advises users instead to patch their systems.  The DHS should have been looped in early on to help coordinate the flaws\u2019 disclosure, Joyent\u2019s Mr. Cantrill said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why CERT would not be your first stop,\u201d he said.

SES SA will join Intelsat SA\u2019s campaign to keep serving customers in a chunk of the C-band. Photo: handout/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images  Two top commercial satellite operators agreed to team up on a plan to clear some of their wireless spectrum for use by other companies, a move they say will spur new telecom investment.  SES SA said it will join Intelsat SA\u2019s I 2.02% campaign to keep serving U.S. customers in a chunk of the C-band, a swath of airwaves in the middle of the broader radio spectrum, while allowing other wireless operators to take over a smaller sliver of the band. The companies said they serve about 90% of the U.S. market in the C-band, which media companies use to beam video to cable companies for distribution.  The success of the satellite companies\u2019 proposal, also backed by computer chip maker Intel Corp. INTC -1.63% , will affect how quickly the U.S. adopts fifth-generation, or 5G networks. Several telecom companies are jostling for increasingly scarce spectrum licenses that could support connected cars, medical equipment and other gear that would be constantly connected to the wireless network.  The plan could still face opposition from wireless carriers that would prefer to move all satellite operators off the band entirely. Satellite companies have said that is a non-starter.  \u201cIt would not really be feasible to say, \u2019Hey move to another band, we\u2019re using this now,\u2019\u201d Intelsat Chief Executive Steve Spengler said in an interview. \u201cSatellite operators have built satellites specifically for this. There\u2019s a huge investment that\u2019s already in place today.\u201d  The focus now shifts to the Federal Communications Commission. The agency has yet to launch a rule-making process for the spectrum but is expected to start in the coming months. Satellite companies say they could start moving their operations to a narrow section of the band about two years after that process starts.  \u201cI\u2019m not persuaded that there is a better path than the one we\u2019ve created,\u201d SES CEO Karim Sabbagh.  If the plan succeeds or the FCC auctions off all of the spectrum, there will likely be plenty of takers.  A much-maligned pitch for a new government-backed 5G network focused heavily on the C-band. The proposal\u2019s authors argued it was the broadest and most useful radio frequency available to U.S. policy makers looking to jump-start 5G infrastructure investment.  Government officials quickly disavowed that plan, which included an idea for a nationalized government-run network, but the band is still the subject of intense private-sector interest.  \u201cIt really is the sweet spot for wireless operators to think about,\u201d said Tim Farrar, a telecom analyst at industry research TMF Associates. He noted that wireless operators like Sprint Corp. have locked up many other licenses that could serve the same purposes. \u201cIt\u2019s not the beachfront property, but it\u2019s a hotel with vacant rooms.\u201d  Write to Drew FitzGerald at andrew.fitzgerald@wsj.com", "stock": "INTC", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-09", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/satellite-operators-pitch-plan-to-share-airwaves-1518132645"}, {"article": "Hours after we published an editorial Friday about the Justice Department\u2019s refusal to turn over a document subpoenaed by the House Intelligence Committee, Chairman Devin Nunes (R., Calif.) received an official response from Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd.  It was cleverly spun. Mr. Boyd played up the access to the secondary information Mr. Nunes had demanded\u2014access to the application and renewals for the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants on one-time Trump associate Carter Page. Mr. Boyd describes his department\u2019s response as \u201cextraordinary accommodation.\u201d  Upon inspection, however, the focus on the FISA warrants looks more like an effort to distract attention from Mr. Boyd\u2019s refusal even to mention Mr. Nunes\u2019s main request of FBI Director Christopher Wray and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. That request was for the \u201celectronic communication,\u201d or memo, that officially launched the counterintelligence investigation into alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.  On Friday Trey Gowdy, an Intel Committee member who has seen a redacted form of the memo, said Justice has redacted the \u201cgood stuff.\u201d He means information that would tell whether the counterintelligence investigation was credible, and how and whether the FBI vetted the information. \u201cAll of that,\u201d Mr. Gowdy said, \u201cis in a paragraph I can\u2019t read.\u201d  Justice says the blacked-out paragraph can\u2019t be shared with Congress because it identifies a foreign country that shares intelligence with the U.S. This is a hard argument to credit, given that in December someone told the New York Times that Australian diplomat Alexander Downer was the source for the information that minor Trump campaign official George Papadopoulos had bragged about Russian dirt on Hillary Clinton. In February former CIA Director John Brennan referred to the FBI\u2019s relationship with British intelligence when asked about the information on Mr. Papadopoulos.  Mr. Nunes needs this information because it is crucial to understanding whether Justice and the FBI had good reason to launch this investigation\u2014and how they handled it. The Papadopoulos narrative matters to the FBI, because attributing the launch of the investigation to him minimizes the role of the now infamous Steele dossier.  Some suspect that the real reason Justice is keeping this paragraph secret is because it might reveal embarrassing facts about how the Papadopoulos information was used. This might include a role for political actors (rather than intelligence officials) in ginning up the Trump-Russia investigation.  Meanwhile, on Saturday President Trump asked in a tweet what \u201cJustice and the FBI have to hide\u201d? He added, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t they giving the strongly requested documents (unredacted) to the HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE?\u201d\u2014which has subpoenaed similar information about FBI actions during the 2016 election.  The President might ask the same about the stonewalling of the Intel Committee. Do Mr. Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions think that ignoring the committee\u2019s main request is in the spirit of the \u201cextraordinary accommodation\u201d that Mr. Boyd claims?  The Justice Department is part of the executive branch.

Committee Chairman Devin Nunes owes ranking Democrat Adam Schiff a thank you for assisting his case.  The 10-page Democratic memo begins by declaring that \u201cThe FBI and DOJ officials did not \u2018abuse\u2019 the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) process, omit material information, or subvert this vital tool to spy on the Trump campaign.\u201d Yet the facts it lays out show the opposite.  In particular the memo confirms that the FBI used an opposition-research document paid for by the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee as part of its application to surveil Carter Page, who was associated with the Donald Trump campaign.  Democrats dispute the degree to which the FBI relied on the dossier created by opposition-researcher Christopher Steele in applying for its FISA court order, but that\u2019s beside the point. If the FBI had as much \u201ccompelling evidence\u201d and \u201cprobable cause\u201d as the memo asserts, it would not have needed to cite the Steele document. And the Democrats do not dispute that the Steele dossier was the FBI\u2019s only source in its initial FISA application for its allegation that Mr. Page met with suspect Russians in Moscow in July 2016.  The Democratic memo makes no attempt to rebut the widely reported news that former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe told Congress that the FBI would not have sought a surveillance warrant without the dossier. Democratic Rep. Jim Himes claimed on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that Mr. McCabe never said that, but then why not put that in the memo?  The Democratic memo also confirms that the FBI withheld from the court the partisan provenance of the dossier. Democrats even provide, for the first time in public, the precise language the FBI used in its initial application in a long, obfuscating footnote.  Democrats say the FBI told the FISA court that a \u201claw firm\u201d [Clinton/DNC firm Perkins Coie] hired \u201can identified U.S. person\u201d [oppo-research firm Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson ] to \u201cconduct research regarding Candidate #1s ties to Russia.\u201d The \u201cidentified U.S. person\u201d then hired \u201cSource #1\u201d [Mr. Steele] to do the research. The footnote ends: \u201cThe FBI speculates that the identified U.S. person was likely looking for information that could be used to discredit Candidate #1\u2019s campaign.\u201d  Speculates? Likely? Could? The dossier was paid for by actors whose overriding purpose was to defeat Mr. Trump. Nowhere do Democrats say the FBI used the words \u201cpolitical\u201d or \u201cpartisan\u201d or \u201ccampaign,\u201d much less Clinton or Democratic National Committee.  The Democratic memo claims the FBI acted \u201cappropriately\u201d in not \u201crevealing\u201d the name of an \u201centity\u201d in a FISA application, but this is laughable. The FBI sometimes masks identities to preserve sources and methods, but the Steele dossier was a pastiche of gossip and rumor based on Mr. Steele\u2019s contacts. Disclosing his partisan funders would have betrayed no important intelligence sources but would have given the court reason to ask the FBI for more credible information before granting an eavesdrop order.  Messrs. Steele and Simpson briefed their media friends in September and October about their dossier, despite FBI prohibitions. The FBI nonetheless falsely told the court that Mr. Steele wasn\u2019t the source of a Yahoo News article that it used as additional evidence in its application. While the Democratic memo repeatedly refers to Mr. Steele\u2019s reporting as \u201creliable\u201d and \u201ccredible,\u201d it confirms that the FBI fired Mr. Steele after it found he hadn\u2019t told the truth about his media spinning.  The Democratic memo devotes considerable space to smearing the hapless Mr. Page, as if he\u2019s some kind of master spy and the Rosetta Stone of the Trump-Russia story. Yet no one has offered proof that he colluded with the Russians, and he hasn\u2019t been indicted.  Democrats also make much of the fact the FBI started looking into the Trump campaign in July 2016 but didn\u2019t receive \u201cSteele\u2019s reporting\u201d until \u201cmid-September.\u201d So what? The issue here is the fairness and honesty of the FISA application in late October (not the investigation), and what matters is that the FBI didn\u2019t move on the FISA application until after it received the dossier.  ***  The only definitive evidence of political \u201ccollusion\u201d so far is that the Clinton campaign paid Mr. Steele to troll his Russian sources for dirt on Donald Trump. The FBI then used this dirt as a reason to spy on Mr. Page and anyone he was communicating with.

WSJ's David Pierce has a few tricks and tips to pull yourself back into the real world. Photo/Video: Emily Prapuolenis/The Wall Street Journal  When smartphones came to steal our attention, we never had a chance. Even in the rare moments we manage to put them down, they buzz incessantly, begging us to come back.  It\u2019s fine for phones to be engrossing when we\u2019re bored on a layover. More often they should help us work or exercise or find a Starbucks , then get out of the way.  Now, more than a decade into the smartphone era, investors, activists and customers alike have begun to push phone makers, especially Apple Inc., AAPL 0.34% to find a way to solve phone addiction.  The feature we need already exists: It\u2019s called Do Not Disturb. Whether you use an iPhone or an Android device, you have a one-tap way to shut your phone up. Do Not Disturb should be every smartphone user\u2019s best friend and saving grace. Instead, it\u2019s a relic of a long-gone era, a feature that doesn\u2019t work the way we do.  The iPhone\u2019s \u2018Do Not Disturb\u2019 feature shuts off nearly everything. You can engage it manually or schedule your silence ahead of time. Photo: David Pierce/The Wall Street Journal  Apple launched Do Not Disturb in 2012 to keep your phone from waking you up in the middle of the night. When you tap the moon icon, your phone instantly shuts up. Your notifications are visible if you wake up your phone, but it won\u2019t buzz or light up automatically. There are only small nuances: You can name contacts who can call you\u2014no texts get through when Do Not Disturb is engaged\u2014or allow anyone who calls twice to buzz through on the second call.  Last year, the company launched Do Not Disturb While Driving, which engages when your phone connects to your car stereo or its motion sensors detect driving. It allows alarms and timers\u2014and Apple Maps navigation\u2014but generally keeps the screen dark. Anyone who messages you can receive an automatic response.  The problem is that this dichotomy\u2014you\u2019re either on or off, zero or 100\u2014doesn\u2019t actually represent how people use their phones. When you\u2019re sleeping, you might want total quiet. But what about at work, when you\u2019re still reachable but trying to focus on your presentation instead of incessant ESPN updates? Or when the people you care most about would rather use WhatsApp or Snapchat, instead of calling you? Turning on Do Not Disturb is like taking your landline phone off the hook to keep it from ringing.  Apple\u2019s \u2018Do Not Disturb While Driving\u2019 allows you to auto-respond to texts so your friends won\u2019t wonder why you\u2019re not replying. Photo: David Pierce/The Wall Street Journal  Do Not Disturb should have a sort of volume meter, from 0 to 10. When you\u2019re bored on the couch, turn the knob all the way up and let the distracting notifications flow. When you\u2019re asleep go to 0: silence is golden. In between, users ought to be able to control what gets through and when.  At work you need buzzes for your calendar, email and Slack, but would rather not have Candy Crush luring you back in before lunchtime. There should be an \u201cI\u2019m in a meeting\u201d setting, and a \u201cGet me out of this meeting\u201d one, too.  Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google does this better. Android\u2019s Do Not Disturb, launched in 2014, has a Total Silence mode, but also offers Priority Mode. With that engaged, only the apps you\u2019ve handpicked can buzz your phone. My friends can message me on all the apps I use, but Starbucks can\u2019t tell me about deals, and Twitter can\u2019t suck me back into my timeline. Android also allows you to let calendar notifications or reminders through the Do Not Disturb wall.  Google could do more; Apple could do much more. Users should be able to set their own rules. Studies have shown that when people reduce notifications, they worry they\u2019re missing important things. By ensuring you\u2019re seeing the things that matter, and shutting up the (many, many more) things that don\u2019t, Do Not Disturb could address this.  Android users can set rules for \u2018Do Not Disturb,\u2019 allowing certain apps or people through the wall. Photo: David Pierce/The Wall Street Journal  At the same time, Android and iOS should begin automatically managing your phone\u2019s distractions. They could differentiate between morning and evening, weekend and weekdays. Android can engage Do Not Disturb in sync with your calendar events, but it can\u2019t tell whether you\u2019re bored in the dentist\u2019s waiting room or stressing in a job interview. Devices could use their knowledge of your location, calendar and activity to figure out exactly how much you can be bothered.  Apple and Google are the only companies in a position to make this work at the system level. Third-party developers can\u2019t access the control they\u2019d need, across apps and services, to regulate the whole system. (And would you want them to?)  How to Do \u2018Do Not Disturb\u2019 Set a schedule . You can make Do Not Disturb turn on at the same time every day\u2014maybe after dinner, when it\u2019s time to relax\u2014and off again in the morning.  . You can make Do Not Disturb turn on at the same time every day\u2014maybe after dinner, when it\u2019s time to relax\u2014and off again in the morning. Pick your favorites. You can allow all phone calls even when Do Not Disturb is engaged, but a better move is to name the four or five people who should always get through. Think partners, bosses, babysitters.

One app, Flipd, can temporarily remove distracting apps from your phone, but \u201cthis is not something Apple makes it easy for us to do,\u201d said Alanna Harvey, one of the app\u2019s co-founders. Even the setup is enough to scare people away, though Ms. Harvey says it\u2019s the app\u2019s most popular feature \u201conce people get over the hump.\"  Google and Apple say they\u2019re working on improvements to Do Not Disturb, though both declined to provide specific plans.  Spokesmen for both companies also pointed to notification controls as another way to manage your influx. I don\u2019t see it that way. Certainly, you should control which apps can notify you and how, but there\u2019s no \u201cwhen\u201d notification setting. What users really need is an easy way to receive notifications from partners, bosses and close friends\u2014and from any app. Why constantly tweak each app\u2019s notifications? We should be able to make the rules once, with one tool, and not worry about it again.  When you really need to focus, of course, there\u2019s one feature even more powerful than Do Not Disturb. Just turn your phone off. But then how will you navigate home? Or read your book? Or plan dinner, play \u201cAlto\u2019s Adventure\u201d or check your fantasy team?

The California Democrat serves as ranking member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, a powerful oversight panel. Recently this committee succeeded in wresting key documents from the Justice Department and FBI after months of being stonewalled, and Republican staffers have summarized the info in a classified four-page memo. Those who have read the memo say it includes evidence of abuses by Justice and FBI officials handling the investigation into Donald Trump\u2019s alleged ties with Russia, most salaciously summed up in the infamous Steele dossier named for the former British spy who compiled it.  But whether it\u2019s material submitted to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court for a warrant on a Trump campaign official or conveniently missing texts between an FBI agent and his FBI mistress\u2014who both hated Mr. Trump and would each serve on the special counsel\u2019s team\u2014Mr. Schiff exhibits no interest. Saturday on CNN he implied that the only ones who are interested are Russian bots on Twitter .  When CNN\u2019s Ana Cabrera asked him why not let the American people see the info and decide for themselves, Mr. Schiff went full Jack Nicholson : \u201cThe American people, unfortunately, don\u2019t have the underlying materials and therefore they can\u2019t see how distorted and misleading this document is,\u201d he answered. Translation: The American people can\u2019t handle the truth.  It makes no sense. If the American people lack context, that\u2019s an argument for more disclosure, not less. But it fits a pattern. Mr. Schiff tells us there is \u201cmore than circumstantial evidence\u201d of collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow. But he never produces it.  To put it another way, Mr. Schiff appears to be the only man in America who doesn\u2019t seem to want to know whether the material in the Steele dossier is true or not. All along he has stood against getting relevant information\u2014fighting subpoenas for Justice, fighting subpoenas for the FBI, and fighting the subpoena for the bank records of Fusion GPS (which ultimately prompted the admission that the Clinton campaign had helped fund the Steele dossier).  Last week offered a good example of the Schiff standard in operation. Democrats wanted the House testimony of Fusion co-founder Glenn Simpson made public, and Republicans on the Intel committee joined them to vote in favor of releasing it. But when it came to making the classified memo available to any congressman who wished to read it, Republicans alone stood for transparency. Every Democrat, led by Mr. Schiff, voted to keep the memo secret.  On the Saturday following this vote, the chairmen of three key House oversight committees\u2014 Devin Nunes (Intel), Bob Goodlatte (Judiciary) and Trey Gowdy (Oversight)\u2014met to discuss the way forward. They released no statement. But as more of their members see the memo, the rumbling to make the information public will only grow.  Meanwhile, even Democrats not on the Intel Committee have been infected by the same lack of curiosity that afflicts Mr. Schiff. In the few days since the memo became available to every member of the House, roughly 190 Republicans have read it, compared with only a dozen Democrats.  Congress\u2014especially the oversight committees\u2014is supposed to act as the people\u2019s watchdog. Mr. Trump is routinely slammed for his indifference to reading, especially the endless memos and policy papers that find their way onto a president\u2019s desk. But what does it say when the ranking member of a vital oversight committee appears uninterested in what his committee has unearthed about a matter that speaks to the integrity of our highest institutions of law enforcement?  The Beltway standard for comparison for scandal today is Watergate. It\u2019s now been nearly five decades since men affiliated with Richard Nixon\u2019s Committee for the Re-Election of the President were nabbed while breaking into Democratic headquarters at the Watergate complex. The purpose of the break-in was to plant a bug and gain embarrassing intel on the Democratic Party and its presidential candidate, George McGovern.  If Mr. Trump and his team worked with Vladimir Putin to steal the 2016 election from Hillary Clinton, it would indeed be as scandalous as Watergate. But it would be just as scandalous if a Democratic administration\u2019s Justice Department and FBI used unsubstantiated opposition research\u2014parts of which were quite possibly drawn from Russian disinformation\u2014to obtain warrants to spy on members of a Republican presidential campaign.  In 1972, Nixon press secretary Ron Ziegler dismissed the break-in as a \u201cthird-rate burglary.\u201d Today Mr. Schiff routinely dismisses the House Intel Committee findings about Justice and the FBI\u2019s handling of the Steele dossier as \u201ca profound distraction\u201d\u2014while he too fights an investigation into a presidential election. Could that be why he\u2019s so opposed to letting the American people see what he\u2019s seen?

REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo  Amazon on Wednesday rose over 2 percent and touched $1,500 for the first time, while Netflix rose also rose over 2 percent and nearly hit its own record high.  Investors, left nervous after major indexes slumped into correction territory at the start of the month but still confident about the health of the U.S. economy, are doubling down on already popular companies expected to post above-average earnings growth. Many of those are businesses poised to benefit from consumers and companies with more money to spend and invest as a result of U.S. tax cuts enacted this year.  Among such stocks, Amazon has climbed 2.7 percent since the end of January and Netflix has increased 4.9 percent, both outperforming the S&P 500\u2019s 3.3 percent decline.  \u201cInvestors are willing to pay a premium for go-go tech stocks that can deliver returns in any environment,\u201d said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors in Chicago. \u201cPeople are going to stay home and eat popcorn and watch movies on Netflix no matter what.\u201d  Analysts on average expect Amazon to increase its adjusted, non-GAAP earnings per share by 82 percent this year. Netflix\u2019s earnings per share are expected to more than triple, according to Thomson Reuters data.  That compares with expectations for S&P 500 aggregate earnings to expand by an unusually strong 19.1 percent in 2018, helped by a tax cuts and a stronger economy, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  In terms of their earnings valuations, Amazon and Netflix appear exceptionally expensive compared with most stocks. Amazon recently traded at 155 times earnings expected over the next 12 months, while Netflix traded at 94 times expected earnings, according to Thomson Reuters data.  As the dust settles from the sell-off earlier this month, investors also remain optimistic about the technology sector. After leading last year\u2019s stock market rally, the S&P 500 information technology index in 2018 is in a neck-and-neck lead with consumer discretionary, both about 4.9 percent higher year to date. Amazon is the most heavily weighted stock in the consumer discretionary index and accounted for much of its gain.

Overall S&P 500 earnings grew about 12.8 percent in 2017 and are seen increasing another 17.9 percent this year.  While analysts have increased their earnings estimates for hundreds of companies to account for new tax cuts, investors still lack a clear picture of how companies will spend their windfalls.

Netflix turned a DVD-by-mail business into an online competitor of movie channel HBO. As it grew it began licensing its own original shows to ensure a stream of new offerings if studio suppliers ended deals.  In fact, Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) is making a major push into online streaming and will pull its first-run shows and movies from Netflix in 2019 as Hollywood fights for audiences.  Netflix plans to spend up to $8 billion this year on TV shows and movies to fend off Disney, Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), studios-owned Hulu and local competitors that are jumping into online video, and it is turning more and more to high-budget projects, such as the roughly $90 million \u201cBright.\u201d  In 2017, Netflix recorded its first full-year profit in international markets.

In contrast, U.S. wireless carrier Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) said on Tuesday that it lost a net of 29,000 Fios Video connections in the latest quarter, reflecting the shift from traditional linear video to over-the-top offerings.  Netflix spent $90 million on Will Smith action movie \u201cBright\u201d last year, its largest investment in an original film to date, and is already planning a sequel and additional investment in original films.  \u201cNetflix continues to prove out the thesis that Internet TV is replacing linear TV on a global basis,\u201d Evercore ISI analyst Vijay Jayant said.

It\u2019s the top-performing stock in the S&P 500 this year.  Jeffrey Wlodarczak at Pivotal Research Group raised his price target to a Street-high $400 on Tuesday, arguing that as long as Netflix continues to beat estimates and issue bullish subscriber forecasts, the stock will continue to advance. Wlodarczak said Netflix\u2019s higher-than-expected 2018 marketing-expense forecast didn\u2019t faze investors, writing in a note that \u201cthe market appeared to effectively give NFLX management carte blanche to spend aggressively to drive healthy subscriber growth.\u201d  The company\u2019s aggressive spending on original content and marketing means it probably won\u2019t generate free cash flow for the next few years, with analysts on average predicting outflows of $2.85 billion this year, $1.92 billion in 2019 and $1.16 billion 2020, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Netflix signed up 8.33 million customers in the fourth quarter, surpassing analysts\u2019 estimates of 6.34 million, thanks in large part to the popularity of the fantasy series \u201cStranger Things\u201d and the new Will Smith movie \u201cBright.\u201d  That success has inspired Facebook Inc., Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. to try their hand at original programming. It has also spurred rivals like Walt Disney Co. to invest more in online services and acquire competitors. Yet Netflix enjoys a head start on all those players.

Canada\u2019s second-most populous province said Tuesday it would make the collection of the provincial sales tax mandatory for suppliers of goods and services based outside Quebec to put them on par with local rivals. Quebec expects the measures will enable it to recover C$155 million ($120 million) in lost revenue over five years, according to budget documents released in Quebec City.  A failure to collect taxes on online sales of goods and services to companies outside the province now costs Quebec about C$270 million annually, according to estimates by the provincial finance ministry. Most of the money, or C$158 million, pertains to goods such as shoes and clothes purchased abroad, Finance Minister Carlos Leitao said Tuesday.  An agreement between Los Gatos, California-based Netflix and the federal government over filming in Canada provoked widespread outrage in Quebec last year, in part because it didn\u2019t subject the company to a sales tax. That sparked the ire of Canadian media companies that must apply the tax, including on streaming units they set up to compete with Netflix.  \u201cFor services, Netflix and others, we are proposing legislative measures that will force these companies to register for our provincial sales tax regime,\u201d Leitao said Tuesday at a press conference in Quebec City. \u201cThey will need to collect the sales tax and to send it to us.\u201d  For companies selling goods online, Quebec will follow the approach recommended by the Organization for Economic Co- Operation and Development, which is to collect taxes at the border, Leitao said.  Starting Jan. 1, foreign companies that sell more than C$30,000 a year in taxable supplies of goods or services to Quebec consumers will be required to register for the provincial sales tax, budget documents show. Until now, suppliers without a physical or significant presence in the province weren\u2019t required to register for the tax, or to collect or remit it.  Canadian companies that don\u2019t have a physical or significant presence in Quebec will get eight more months to adjust: they won\u2019t be required to register for the provincial sales tax until Sept. 1, 2019.  \u201cGiven the Canadian economy\u2019s high level of integration, a potentially significant number of businesses of all sizes may be impacted,\u201d the finance ministry\u2019s document says.

Matthew Harrigan, an analyst at Buckingham Research Group, downgraded the stock to neutral from buy, saying he\u2019s skeptical that the company can replicate its domestic success abroad, especially in Asia where the local competition is dense and Netflix lacks pricing power.  \u201cYou\u2019ve got to step back and do a sanity check on this,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a great product and are competing with other great media companies. But this isn\u2019t like Amazon, where it has the opportunity to take over the world with AI and penetrate every retail category.\u201d  Chief Financial Officer David Wells said on an earnings call late Monday that as the company continues to build its content, some of the factors influencing its working capital needs have started to moderate.  \u201cAs our operating profit grows, we\u2019ll be able to pay more for that organically,\u201d he said.  Content and subscriber growth are the roots to Netflix\u2019s success, which is why it\u2019s hard to see the company pulling back from that to help turn cash flow positive, said Rahim Shad, a high-yield analyst at Invesco Ltd.  \u201cWith Hulu and Amazon making their own strides in original content, you almost have to spend your way to remain relevant and successful at this game,\u201d Shad said in an interview. The upside case for the bonds would be a takeover by an investment-grade company like Apple Inc., as Disney plans to acquire a majority of 21st Century Fox Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. is already developing its own content, he said.  Netflix also said it doesn\u2019t expect the new limitation on interest deductibility in the recently passed U.S. tax law to affect its business. That aspect of the law has been seen to deal a blow to junk-rated companies, especially those rated B and lower. Netflix is rated B1 by Moody\u2019s Investors Service and an equivalent B+ by S&P Global Ratings.  \u2014 With assistance by Sridhar Natarajan, and Lucas Shaw", "stock": "NFLX", "label": 1, "date": "2018-01-23", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-23/netflix-seeks-to-woo-debt-buyers-with-100-billion-stock-cushion"}, {"article": "While the world rebels against Facebook Inc., Netflix Inc. is stirring up controversy in Brazil.  A small but loud #DeleteNetflix campaign has burst forth on Twitter since \"The Mechanism,\" a show that is a work of fiction based on the real-life, multi-year corruption probe dubbed Carwash, was added to the streaming service Friday. Ex-users are posting proof of their now-defunct accounts in one of Netflix\u2019s most successful international markets.  Former President Dilma Rousseff, who was impeached in 2016 amid fallout from the scandal, called the show \"underhanded and full of lies.\" Prominent movie critic Pablo Villaca said he canceled his subscription after six years and encouraged others to do the same, saying the decision to air the show was \"irresponsible.\"  \"The director invents facts. He doesn\u2019t merely reproduce fake news. He has turned himself into a creator of fake news,\" according to a post on Rousseff\u2019s website. \"It would be like if a movie about the last moments of John Kennedy inserted a Lee Harvey Oswald character making accusations against the victim. Or a movie where Winston Churchill makes a deal with Adolf Hitler to attack the United States.\"  The debacle took over local media, with director Jose Padilha, who also produced the Netflix hit \"Narcos,\" responding that critics are too focused on the details and missing the bigger picture.  While this isn\u2019t the first portrayal of the corruption probe that continues sweeping through Brazil\u2019s political and business elite, the timing of the release -- on the day the operation hit its 50th phase -- has helped fuel some of the reaction.  After successive scandals that almost took down a second president in as many years, most of Congress and the presidency will be up for grabs in general elections in October. On Monday, former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva had a 12-year prison sentence for corruption confirmed by an appeals court. He awaits a Supreme Court ruling that will determine whether or not he will be arrested, and with that, influence the role he will play in the elections.  Lula leads all voter polls, and he has repeatedly reiterated his innocence and denounced the Carwash investigation as political persecution, saying he will fight until the very end.  Sergio Moro, the judge who became the face of the Carwash probe and hailed by some Brazilians as a savior of sorts for locking up corrupt politicians and businessmen, said in an TV interview Monday that while there are artistic liberties in both the movie and the show, drawing attention to Brazil\u2019s issue with corruption is important.  The show changed the names of those involved in the case -- Petrobras, as the state-run oil company at the center of the investigation is known, became Petrobrasil. Alberto Youssef, Brazil\u2019s black-market central banker who was one of the to be caught up in the probe, is portrayed as Roberto Ibrahim.  One of the biggest points of controversy is a conversation in which a politician -- who resembles Lula -- talks about an agreement to prevent the corruption probe from proceeding. The episode alludes to a political crisis surrounding President Michel Temer, which took down then-Planning Minister Romero Juca after a recording of a similar conversation between himself and a former executive linked to Petrobras emerged.  \"The left was and is just as corrupt as the right. \u2018The Mechanism\u2019 has no ideology,\" Padilha is cited as saying in Estado de S.Paulo newspaper.  Netflix is no stranger to Brazilian political drama. The company placed large ads at the Brasilia airport -- the nation\u2019s capital, where much of the Carwash probe has taken place -- to promote the latest season of House of Cards. When news broke in May that a businessman had secretly recorded the president allegedly discussing hush money in a fresh round of scandal that almost took down the government, that show\u2019s profile tweeted -- in Portuguese -- \"It\u2019s getting hard to compete.\"  On Tuesday, Netflix\u2019s official Twitter account in Brazil posted a video with a mock ad for a \"corruption store\" featuring products such as fashionable covers for ankle monitors and underwear with pockets to better store bribes.  Netflix didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment on the impact of the show, viewership or subscription data.  \u2014 With assistance by Paula Sambo, and Fabiola Moura", "stock": "NFLX", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-27", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-27/-deletenetflix-campaign-erupts-in-brazil-over-corruption-show"}, {"article": "Netflix Inc. is lifting the curtain on just how much the sexual harassment controversy is going to cost Hollywood.

The rapid pace of subscriber additions is impressive, but so is the amount of cash going up in flames.  Netflix Inc. is the Uber of the entertainment programming business. Whether Netflix investors recoil or cheer at the comparison depends on their risk tolerance.  Netflix doesn't share Uber's inclination to push boundaries, and it has a well-functioning business. But both companies are impressive growth machines that rely on outside funding to maintain the momentum. And in both cases, it's not clear what the real trajectory of the business would look like if access to capital dried up.  First, let's run through the impressive growth part of the Netflix machine.  Growing Like a Weed Netflix keeps adding streaming video subscribers rapidly Source: Bloomberg  Netflix said on Monday that it added 8.3 million more subscribers than it lost for its streaming service. That was the most new streaming customers in Netflix's history. Even in the U.S., where analysts believe more than half of households with fast internet service already subscribe to Netflix, the company added more net new streaming customers in 2017 than it did the year before. The continued pace of customer additions validates both Netflix's recent decision to raise prices on many subscribers in the U.S. and to go all-in on a globalization strategy the company unveiled two years ago.  But just like at Uber, growth comes at a cost for Netflix. That cost is the piles of money Netflix has set alight for three years to finance its globe-trotting ambitions, and to purchase -- rather than rent -- more of the TV shows and movies the company makes available to streaming subscribers. The cash costs for Netflix's streaming programming reached $8.9 billion in 2017, about double the costs from two years earlier. The number of Netflix streaming customers hasn't increased as much, at about 60 percent, over that period.  Bonfire Netflix's free cash flow has turned negative in the last three years as the company splurged on programming and international expansion Source: Netflix  Netflix also said its free cash flow would widen to as much as negative $4 billion in 2018, compared with an already stunning negative $2 billion in 2017. Netflix has already been clear it won't generate positive cash flow for years as it tries to become the preferred entertainment source for the world, and one that has profitable economics. But potentially burning through $4 billion in cash is staggering. Netflix and Uber are betting that the companies should lean into their growth and spend even more to get bigger fast. It could turn out to be a stellar bet. Or fail spectacularly.  Netflix's strategy means two things: The company must keep churning out shows compelling enough to persuade more people to subscribe, and it needs to be able to continue borrowing money at low cost to finance its losses.  So far, Netflix stock and debt investors aren't worried. Netflix bonds due in 2026 have been trading just below 100 cents on the dollar. Netflix shares shot up about 9 percent in after-hours trading after the company released its financial results. Already the company's enterprise value is more than 50 times estimated 2018 earnings excluding interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and employee stock compensation costs. Those are not characteristics indicating signs of worry.  It's hard to find fault with Netflix's execution or its track record. The company is making a rational decision to splurge while it can and borrow money while it's cheap. But no one knows what Netflix looks like in normal funding times. What happens if the debt market isn't as compliant in coming years? The Netflix growth machine suddenly looks less like a sure thing. I'd call it a roller-coaster ride, but at least roller coasters tend to follow a predictable trajectory and wind up exactly where they started. For Netflix, confidence about where the company ends up is all in the eye of the beholder.

Netflix, which released its first original series just six years ago, has now lured two of the most successful producers in TV -- Murphy and Shonda Rhimes -- from two of the industry\u2019s most valuable companies. Rhimes, the producer of \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d and \u201cScandal,\u201d bolted from Walt Disney Co.\u2019s ABC in August.  No longer content to license shows from other media companies, Netflix and fellow technology giant Amazon.com Inc. are throwing money at Hollywood\u2019s top talent to lure them away from those studios. They are upending the TV business in the process, driving up the cost of talent and weakening many of the traditional powers.  Ryan Murphy Photographer: Monica Schipper/Getty Images for Entertainment Weekly  Hollywood studios have endured threats from outsiders before, but the list of talent making the jump grows by the day.  Horror Story  Netflix, with an annual budget of $8 billion, is paying Murphy, the producer of \u201cAmerican Horror Story,\u201d about $300 million over five years to make shows and movies for the streaming service. The money will support overhead for Ryan Murphy Productions along with his fees for writing, directing and producing.  Murphy was in the process of negotiating a new deal at Fox when Disney agreed to buy its crosstown rival for more than $52 billion. Disney Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger made a personal call to Murphy, assuring him that \u201cthe reason Disney was interested in buying Fox is they believed in the assets and the executives and their creators,\u201d the producer recalled. \u201cHe was very sweet and transparent and kind.\u201d  Shondaland  Shonda Rhimes Photographer: Bryan Bedder/Getty Images for Vulture Festival  Rhimes was the biggest name to leave traditional TV for streaming when she announced she was signing a long-term deal with Netflix. She\u2019d worked at ABC for more than a decade, becoming one of the few showrunners and TV writers known to the public.  Rhimes is also one of the few prominent black showrunners in Hollywood, and has led the way in creating more diversity onscreen. Netflix gave her more than $100 million to ease the transition in a multiyear deal.  Zombies  Robert Kirkman Photographer: Tommaso Boddi/Getty Images for AMC  Robert Kirkman, the creator of cable TV\u2019s biggest hit, \u201cThe Walking Dead,\u201d signed a two-year deal with Amazon last August, days before Netflix announced its deal with Rhimes. Amazon spent an estimated $4.5 billion on video programming last year and plans to increase its budget this year. Amazon\u2019s \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u201d won the Golden Globe award for best TV comedy.  Millarworld  Mark Millar Photographer: Karwai Tang/WireImage via Getty Images  Netflix knows its customers love comic book movies and TV shows thanks to a pair of deals with Disney, owner of Marvel Studios. So last year it acquired the company that published graphic novels \u201cWanted\u201d and \u201cKick-Ass,\u201d both of which were adapted into hit movies for Universal Pictures.  Netflix and Millarworld founder Mark Millar will jointly produce films, series and children\u2019s shows based on comic-book characters for the streaming service, while the publisher will also continue to make comics under the Netflix label. The streaming service will turn some of Millar\u2019s other creations into film and TV properties that can replace Marvel when its deal with Disney ends.  New Golden Boy  Shawn Levy Photographer: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images  Shawn Levy rose through the ranks of Hollywood by directing comedy films for major studios, including \u201cCheaper by the Dozen\u201d and \u201cNight at the Museum.\u201d Yet he has since been reborn as one of the hottest producers in TV thanks to \u201cStranger Things,\u201d the surprise Netflix fantasy hit. The streaming service locked up Levy\u2019s TV business last year, and now funnels all kinds of high-concept projects his way.  Amazon has also allied itself with Sharon Horgan, the British comic and actress who created its critically beloved comedy \u201cCatastrophe.\u201d Though Horgan has a show on HBO (\u201cDivorce\u201d), Amazon gets first dibs on all future work.", "stock": "NFLX", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-15", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-15/netflix-amazon-billions-lure-hollywood-hitmakers-to-jump-ship"}, {"article": "Netflix Inc. has turned heads in Hollywood by spending billions of dollars to lure filmmakers and viewers from rival TV networks. But it\u2019s also frustrated competitors in a less-public way: by poaching talent and driving up pay.  The streaming giant has lured scores of defectors by offering big increases in compensation. Recruits are securing as much as double their pay, including stock and other benefits, people familiar with the matter say.  Hiring Spree Netflix's payroll jumped with the company's global expansion and original programs Source: Company reports  With $10 billion for programming and marketing this year -- and a stock that\u2019s vying again to lead the S&P 500-- Los Gatos, California-based Netflix is upending the way people get paid in Hollywood. TV networks and studios are struggling to keep up with a rival who will spend $300 million on a top producer like Ryan Murphy and pay lavishly further down the food chain.  \u201cWith combinations of base, bonus, equity and long-term incentive, new-media companies are figuring out ways to beat traditional studios,\u201d said Neal Lenarsky, founder of STI Management, which represents executives in the media industry.  Old Hollywood is trying to respond. Some studios have pulled back from selling shows to the online service. Walt Disney Co. went so far as to yank its movies from the company and is launching streaming services of its own. 21st Century Fox Inc. sued in 2016, claiming the company induced executives to breach their contracts. Netflix countersued, and the case is inching along.  Few Titles  None of that is stopping Netflix from attracting publicists with as much as $400,000 in salary and other compensation, or about double their prior paychecks, according to the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private compensation data. More senior professionals are seeing similar increases, said one executive who was approached by Netflix.  In making offers, Netflix estimates a candidate\u2019s value based on experience and title, according to employees who asked not to be identified discussing company policy. Then it pays the recruit at the top of what the corresponding range might be. The company also allows candidates to take as much a 50 percent of their compensation in options, they said. A recent change in California law bars employers from asking applicants about their prior salary.  Titles at Netflix don\u2019t necessarily correspond with Hollywood convention. For the most part, the company has just three executive roles -- director, manager and vice president -- and some represent real promotions for people jumping over. Netflix also lets some staffers see what co-workers earn via an internal database, according to the people.  And while many studios reward employees with amenities like a large personal office and titles that seem to confer prestige, almost no one at Netflix has an office. Not even Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings, who co-founded the company.  Netflix employed more than 5,400 people at year-end, fewer people than its competitors in media, and sales are projected to reach $15.8 billion this year. CBS Corp., owner of the CBS and Showtime TV networks, has a payroll of more 12,000 and revenue projected at $14.5 billion this year.  Perhaps nowhere is Netflix more aggressive than in marketing and public relations. The company will spend about $2 billion promoting its service and shows this year. The company lists almost 500 openings on its website, with about a third in Los Angeles and more than 50 in marketing and PR.  Where the Jobs Are Locations of recent job openings listed at the Netflix website Source: Company website  Once wholly dependent on older movies and TV shows licensed from other companies, Netflix will release 700 original programs this year, including 80 movies. A growing share is produced in-house by Netflix Studios, based in the company\u2019s Hollywood offices.  Producing and promoting those shows requires an expanding legion of employees, from colorists to sound engineers to publicists. Netflix is looking to hire dozens of executives for production and post-production jobs, and still more for marketing.  Experienced staffers are in short supply, forcing Netflix to raid rivals who also happen to be programming suppliers. Last year, Netflix hired Bela Bajaria, formerly with Comcast Corp.\u2019s Universal Television, to oversee unscripted TV, as well as Scott Stuber, a producer based at Universal Pictures, to run feature films. Julie Fontaine, executive vice president of movie publicity at Lions Gate Entertainment Corp., jumped to a similar post. The company has recruited dozens of PR people from agencies and studios including Fox and Disney.  Pleasing Investors  Some analysts have questioned Netflix\u2019s outlays, arguing there\u2019s no way the company can turn a profit while spending at its current pace. But CEO Hastings and his team have satisfied investors by delivering record subscriber growth.  \u201cThere are fewer and fewer services a TV studio can provide an artist or producer that Netflix can\u2019t,\u201d said Anthony DiClemente, an analyst with Evercore ISI. \u201cWall Street investors right now don\u2019t care how much they spend on content and infrastructure as long as subscribers are growing and beating estimates.\u201d  Hastings was asked about sky-high talent spending at a recent event at the company\u2019s Hollywood offices. Besides Ryan Murphy, Netflix also snared Shonda Rhimes, at producer at Disney\u2019s ABC, in a deal valued at more than $100 million.  \u201cDo we worry about overpaying?

Spotify even has the same chief financial officer who took Netflix public -- Barry McCarthy -- and Netflix\u2019s chief content officer Ted Sarandos sits on Spotify\u2019s board.  Read more about the Spotify filing in this Gadfly piece.  The internet has changed the way people consume entertainment, creating an opening for new players to upend sclerotic businesses. Much as Netflix offered customers a cheaper, more convenient alternative to DVDs and pay TV, Spotify has given consumers a reason not to buy CDs from Walmart or songs from iTunes.  \u201cSpotify has transformed the way people access and enjoy music,\u201d the company said in the filing. \u201cToday, millions of people around the world have access to over 35 million tracks through Spotify, whenever and wherever they want.\u201d  Like Netflix, Spotify offers consumers access to a head-spinning selection of content, personalized to their tastes. And like Netflix, Spotify carved out a huge lead, and is now being chased by the biggest players in technology and media.  Big Opportunities?  The world is still in the early stages of the shift to online distribution of movies, TV and music, and the race is on to sign people up all over the world. Netflix, with almost 118 million subscribers worldwide, has allayed concerns about its slowing growth by reminding analysts there are more than 700 million broadband households. Spotify, with 71 million paying users, touts an even larger number in its filing: 1.6 billion payment-enabled smartphone owners expected by 2021.  Being the biggest comes at a cost. Netflix is burning through cash to acquire more programming, telling investors it\u2019s to fund future growth. Spotify delivers more than 70 percent of its sales to music rights holders, despite efforts to improve profit margins.  Sarandos is where the comparisons between Netflix and Spotify get tricky. Netflix, which already forsook DVDs for online streaming, is in the midst of another great evolution. It is building its own studio to produce shows on its own.  Breaking Through  Spotify says it has no interest in signing artists, or paying for artists to record. However, it has another plan to reduce its reliance on its main suppliers: by making them less relevant.  \u201cThe old model favored certain gatekeepers. Artists had to be signed to a label,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Daniel Ek wrote in a letter included in the filing. \u201cThey needed access to a recording studio, and they had to be played on terrestrial radio to achieve success. Today, artists can produce and release their own music.

Here are a few things to watch:  The Tax Man cometh and he\u2019s got good news  The lower corporate tax rate Congress approved late last year has already helped some companies boost profit forecasts for 2018 -- and they\u2019ve entered earnings season willing to share the largess. Macquarie Research estimates most U.S. airlines will see an average 20 percent increase in earnings per share. The benefits will hit first for cash taxpayers like Southwest Airlines Co., which reports Thursday and has already announced bonuses of $1,000 for its workers.  Wal-Mart is getting a roughly $2 billion tax benefit, and analysts expect it to boost share buybacks and potentially cut prices in addition to the worker raises and bonuses it\u2019s already announced. The world\u2019s largest retailer reports Feb. 20.  While Verizon Communications Inc. reported earnings that missed estimates Tuesday, it said it expects a massive windfall from the tax cut to boost 2018 cash flow by $3.5 billion to $4 billion. The largest U.S. wireless carrier hinted it may also reward bonuses, saying in a statement that it will make an announcement later in the day on \u201chow employees will further share in the company\u2019s success.\u201d  Lower tax = more growth = more shovels  The U.S. tax cut contributed to expectations for faster global growth, and that should help companies that sell goods and services worldwide. The International Monetary Fund this week said it expects the world economy to jump 3.9 percent this year and next -- in each case a 0.2 percentage point bump from its projection in October.  With that growth comes more digging, paving and loading, and analysts have raised 2018 forecasts for Caterpillar Inc. even as it wraps its strongest earnings year since 2012 with Thursday\u2019s report. Those roads need more cars, and IHS Markit predicts global auto sales will rise about 1.5 percent in 2018. General Motors Co. has forecast its profit this year will be consistent with a record of as much as $6.50 a share for 2017.  Global Growth Bodes Well for Earnings The fastest global growth in seven years should help lift corporate profits in 2018 Source: IMF economic forecast  Heady times don\u2019t prevent FX headwinds  The strong global economy can only go so far -- corporate earnings are also exposed to the whims of foreign exchange. The euro gained against every major currency in 2017 and strengthened further in January, so expect more profit warnings from European companies like the one last week from Paris-based distiller Remy Cointreau SA. Luxury conglomerate LVMH, which reports Thursday after the Paris stock market closes, and German software maker SAP AG, which reports Jan. 30, are among others that may be hurt by the euro. The question is how big of a hit, and whether it\u2019s already reflected in stock prices.  Euro Beat All Major Currencies Last Year The strengthened euro is likely to hurt European company earnings this season  The flipside? The dollar\u2019s decline against most major currencies should give a boost to U.S. exporters and companies that translate foreign sales back into dollars. PPG Industries Inc. said last week, for example, that the weaker greenback would increase the paint-maker\u2019s 2018 revenue by as much as $300 million. Post-it Notes maker 3M Co., which generates about 60 percent of its sales overseas, reports on Thursday and expects favorable exchange rates to add 10 cents a share to profit this year.  Can profits stay ahead of energy costs?  While surging oil prices will benefit energy companies, they\u2019re also having a wider effect. Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. last week said fourth-quarter earnings got a boost from rising crude prices and growing shipments of other commodities. For chemical makers like DowDuPont Inc., which reports Feb. 1, a big question is whether product prices can rise fast enough to recoup higher costs for oil-derived raw materials.  An iPhone\u2019s ring is heard round the world  And as always, investors will be watching Apple Inc., the world\u2019s most valuable company, when it reports Feb. 1 for signs of how demand is faring for the iPhone X. The results are likely to affect Asian suppliers. South Korea\u2019s LG Display Co. reported Tuesday that operating profit missed the lowest analyst estimate. The news came about a week after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. forecast revenue that fell short of expectations, as waning smartphone sales in China and a strong local currency outweighed booming demand from cryptocurrency miners. Samsung Electronics Co., a supplier and rival to Apple, reported lower-than-projected profit this month as it lost momentum in memory chips.  \u2014 With assistance by Dave McCombs, Nick Turner, Tara Patel, Crayton Harrison, Rebecca Penty, Rick Clough, Julie Johnsson, Jack Kaskey, Mary Schlangenstein, Joe Deaux, Scott Moritz, and Jessica Brice", "stock": "NFLX", "label": 1, "date": "2018-01-23", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-23/netflix-sets-high-bar-for-already-strong-global-earnings-season"}, {"article": "CBS Corp., owner of the most-watched TV network in the U.S., has come up with a solution to investor concerns about the future of the TV business: make more shows like \u201cStar Trek: Discovery.\u201d  The media company has doubled the number of programs it produces in recent years, creating shows for its own TV channels and streaming services, and others for tech giants Netflix, Amazon and Apple. CBS reported record fourth-quarter sales and earnings Thursday, thanks to a 33 percent boost in program licensing and a 20 percent increase in subscription fees, according to a statement Thursday.  \u201cWe have the biggest hits and many of the most valuable programming franchises in the business,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Leslie Moonves said Thursday on a call with analysts. \u201cWe are just beginning to benefit from our strategy to dramatically increase the output at our in-house studios.\u201d  CBS has overcome a slump in TV advertising, and predicts high single-digit growth in sales this year, far more than Wall Street forecasts. Moonves is trying to sustain the momentum at the company he has led for more than a decade while his board explores a merger with Viacom Inc., which like CBS is controlled by the Redstone family. Viacom owns cable networks including MTV and Nickelodeon, as well as the Paramount Pictures studio.  CBS\u2019s CEO opposed the deal in 2016 but has been urged to reconsider by Shari Redstone, who is vice chairman of both companies.

To keep growing, the company has invested in its own online services, including a version of its flagship network called All Access, and Showtime.  Streaming Audience  Those two paid streaming services have reached almost 5 million subscribers, the company said. Moonves said on the call that CBS plans to introduce All Access in Canada in June. The company also offers an online news service for free, and will introduce a sports service in the coming weeks.  While media companies like Walt Disney Co. are clawing back their shows and movies from streaming companies for use by their own services, CBS is trying to have it both ways. \u201cStar Trek: Discovery,\u201d the first new series in the science-fiction franchise in more than a decade, streams on CBS\u2019 All Access in the U.S. and on Netflix everywhere else.

Fourth-quarter earnings at CBS, excluding some items, rose to $1.15 a share, according to the statement, beating the $1.11 average of analysts\u2019 estimates. Revenue grew 11 percent to $3.92 billion, compared with projections of $3.71 billion.

As Netflix continues to ramp up its annual content investment, the streamer has effectively changed the paradigm for content producers in a way that both expands and limits opportunities for producers and studios as well as for rival networks competing for the best content and talent, per Digiday.  Netflix CFO David Wells said recently that in 2018, Netflix will spend $8 billion and produce 700 pieces of original content, including 80 full-length original movies and 80 foreign-language original productions from local international territories where Netflix operates.  Thanks to its massive spending, Netflix has created a seller's market for producers and studios. Here are some of the fundamental ways that the new paradigm initiated under Netflix has benefited content producers:  There are more opportunities to sell content because Netflix is such a major buyer. In addition to buying more shows than other platforms and networks, Netflix also buys more episodes.  Netflix pays producers more money upfront than other programmers.  Netflix is mostly hands-off once it agrees to buy a piece of content, and will largely give producers creative free rein over their projects.

Netflix is accessible through Altice One, which is Altice's device that allows users to access streaming services like YouTube and Pandora. Netflix is partnering with an increasing number of cable providers, and is also integrated into Comcast's Xfinity X1 set-top box.  Under the partnership, Altice customers who aren't already subscribed to Netflix can do so directly through Altice One. Altice USA is one of the US' largest broadband communications and video service providers, with 3.4 million residential pay-TV customers as of Q3 2017. For context, Comcast reported 21.3 million residential video customers for FY 2017.  The Netflix-Altice partnership represents Netflix's ambition to grow through bundling with TV and internet providers. In Q2 2017, Netflix partnered with telecom SFR Group, a France-based subsidiary of Altice, to be sold with SFR's internet and TV services, for example. Bundling with TV and internet providers is mutually beneficial \u2014 Netflix can increase its reach in new markets, while its partners are able to upsell existing customers to more expensive packages.  Bundling with cable operators allows Netflix to capitalize on consumers who view linear TV and OTT services as complementary. A September 2017 study found that 49% of consumers who had their pay-TV service for four years or more subscribe to an OTT service, per TiVo. Even with the broader trend of consumers relying less on linear TV in favor of cheaper digital alternatives, Netflix can grow through set-top box partnerships by capturing long-term pay-TV subscribers who use OTT services in addition to pay-TV.

Netflix has poached prolific US TV producer Ryan Murphy from 21st Century Fox in a deal worth up to $300 million, making it one of the biggest TV production deals ever signed, the Financial Times reports.  Murphy will begin creating content exclusively for Netflix in July, and the series he created at 21st Century Fox, including \"American Horror Story\" and \"Feud,\" will remain on the company's networks. The deal will deepen the existing relationship between Netflix and Murphy, who previously signed a deal to executively produce a Netflix series in February 2017.  Fox bid aggressively to retain Murphy, but the producer's decision to move to Netflix makes sense for two key reasons:  Murphy's dodging the uncertainty surrounding the Disney-Fox acquisition. Murphy maintains close relationships with Fox Television Group Chairman Dana Walden and 21st Century Fox President Peter Rice. However, should Disney's landmark acquisition of most of 21st Century Fox's assets close as expected, it's not guaranteed that Walden and Rice will remain in their roles. This uncertainty factored into Murphy's decision to move.  Murphy maintains close relationships with Fox Television Group Chairman Dana Walden and 21st Century Fox President Peter Rice. However, should Disney's landmark acquisition of most of 21st Century Fox's assets close as expected, it's not guaranteed that Walden and Rice will remain in their roles. This uncertainty factored into Murphy's decision to move. He's gaining the creative freedom that comes with producing for a video streaming service. Murphy is known for his graphic and shocking work, and although the producer had virtually full creative freedom at Fox, working at Netflix will likely allow him to further explore his creative boundaries \u2014 creators generally have to worry less about profanity and nudity when creating for Netflix, as it's not a platform driven by ad revenue.  The deal is representative of the intensifying battle between digital video services and traditional media companies for top Hollywood talent. In addition to Fox's bid, Amazon also made a serious bid for the top Hollywood producer, according to The New York Times. Video streaming services like Netflix and Amazon are aggressively pursuing top creators and entertainers as eyeballs shift away from linear TV in favor of digital platforms.  Netflix has been successful in luring top Hollywood talent in the past year. The company poached accomplished producers Shonda Rhimes and Betsy Beers from ABC in August 2017. Additionally, Netflix has been able to sign separate deals with former Late Show host David Letterman, and big-name stand-up comedians Chris Rock, Dave Chappelle, and Amy Schumer. Netflix plans to spend up to $8 billion on original content in 2018, up from $6 billion in 2017, and its budget eclipses those of rivals like Amazon and Hulu, positioning Netflix well to continue to court top Hollywood talent.

Swinburne thinks Netflix is \"still in the early stages of global adoption,\" citing the largely untapped international market as one key area of growth potential.  Morgan Stanley, Netflix  But Netflix shares haven't been without their problems as of late. In late March, they were pressured after President Donald Trump announced plans to crack down down on Chinese investment in US technology. They were also hit hard in the wake of Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal. In all, they've fallen more than 10% from their record high of $334 to their current price of $298.  But Swinburne says fear not, Netflix will be hit a fresh record high in no time. He has a $350 price target and a bull-case-scenario target of $440, both of which are well above the Wall Street consensus of $288.  Netflix has roughly 120 million subscribers, but the total addressable market for video streaming is much larger \u2014 more than 660 million by Swinburne's count. He says that, coupled with Netflix's \"history of successfully scaling in a wide variety of markets,\" makes him optimistic on the company's future.  Of those 660 million+ addressable subscribers, Swinburne believes Netflix will capture more than 300 million by 2028. That would represent one third of global broadband, compared to the roughly 20% Netflix has captured thus far, according to the note.  One reason Swinburne thinks Netflix will take much of that large market is not simply because of its superior brand perception as the leader in movie streaming, but also because of the content it can poach. Swinburne identified Netflix's \"ability to maintain exclusive content offering to differentiate product from competitors, and to a lesser extent, success of original programming,\" as core \"key value drivers.\" Netflix is known for winning bids for top original content producers who can make new content, exclusively for its platform.

Netflix's next 100 million subscribers will come from India, said Netflix CEO Reed Hastings at The Economic Times Global Business Summit (GBS) on Friday, per The Economic Times. For context, Netflix last reported 117.6 million global subscribers in Q4 2017.  The company didn't disclose how many India-based subscribers it had, but Consultancy Media Partners Asia estimates this figure at more than 500,000. To help grow its subscriber base in India, the company plans to release five to six Indian originals a year, and it announced on Friday three new Indian original series it's commissioning.  India is an attractive market for Netflix for several reasons:  Consumer spending in India is anticipated to more than double by 2025. Rising household income and economic growth are expected to boost consumer spending in the country to $4 trillion by 2025. Growth in consumer spending implies that the pool of consumers who can sign up for a Netflix subscription will increase significantly in the coming years.

Internet penetration in India has grown nearly sevenfold since 2009, per Kleiner Perkins. Meanwhile, Cisco predicts the number of internet users in India will rise from 373 million in 2016 to 829 million in 2021. And Indian consumers are increasingly viewing long-form online video. Online video consumption in India grew by five times in 2017, with videos longer than 20 minutes accounting for 96% of content viewed on Hotstar, India's largest video streaming service, per WARC. This bodes well for Netflix, which tends to focus on releasing longer-form original series over short-form original content.  However, Netflix's pricing strategy may cause Indian consumers to turn to more affordable streaming services. A Netflix subscription in India costs around $7-12 per month, depending on the package, versus $3 per month for Hotstar and $15 per year for Amazon Prime, which includes access to Prime Video. Hastings said Netflix hopes Indian consumers compare Netflix's price to movie tickets, rather than a typical pay-TV subscription, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Although Indian consumers will gain more disposable income in the coming years, the amount they're willing spend on OTT services will remain limited, which may inhibit Netflix's ability to onboard subscribers in the region.

Japan is one of the largest markets the video-streaming company has entered, and has been considered \"the vanguard of Netflix's entrance into Asia \u2014 a market with not only a large user base but also different cultural dynamics surrounding content streaming,\" according to RBC Analyst Mark Mahaney.  The Japanese market has been hard for streaming companies to crack into because it is usually ahead of the US in terms of technology, meaning there's already a plethora of established \"freemium\" options for consumers to choose from.  However, recent trends show that Netflix is gaining some traction in the country, which could set the stage for a deeper penetration into Asia.  Though only 5% of respondents to an RBC survey said they watched Netflix \u2014 up from 3% in February 2017 \u2014 63% of Japanese subscribers said they were \"Extremely\" or \"Very\" satisfied with Netflix, and a record-high 31% of Japanese subscribers said they were \"Extremely,\" \"Very,\" or \"Moderately\" likely to pay for the streaming service, compared with 24% in the same month a year ago.  \"We believe that these results highlight that Netflix\u2019s entry into Japan is still early, but materially improving,\" Mahaney said.  Mahaney also looked at Google Trends data across the continent and found there were \"consistent upward trends\" in search results for \"Netflix\" in 2017 and into 2018. There have been studies that found a correlation between Google searches of the term \"Netflix\" and Netflix viewership numbers.  \"2017 appears to have been an early pivot year for Netflix in Asia and 2018 is showing good momentum so far,\" Mahaney wrote in a note.  There is also an opportunity to appeal to this large segment of the global population through its slate of new and original content planned for this year, Mahaney says. Around 88% of Japanese respondents indicated that original content influenced their decision to use the service.  \"We believe these [numbers] indicate the broad appeal of Netflix\u2019s Original Content slate, not only across geographies but even across languages barriers,\" Mahaney added.  Mahaney raised his price target to $350 from $300.  Netflix's stock was trading at $323.86 per share, and was up 59.69% for the year.

Netflix announced it will release a series of 15-minute stand-up comedy specials in the coming months, indicating the video streaming service is furthering its push into short-form content, Vulture reports.  The yet-to-be-named comedy series will be released in packages throughout 2018, and will include a mix of newcomer and well-established comics. These specials add to Netflix's growing library of short-form content \u2014 the company added a 15-minute show from Fox Digital Studios in 2017, for example.  The short-form comedies release can help Netflix's aim of acquiring more mobile viewers. Mobile viewers prefer shorter, snackable content \u2014 47% of all mobile video viewing is on videos 20 minutes or shorter, while 39% of views go to content 5 minutes or shorter, according to Ooyala per Variety. Appealing to mobile users can help Netflix measure up to YouTube, which ranked first in terms of average monthly users across iPhone and Android in 2017.  Netflix's expansion into short-form contrasts Facebook's content strategy, which leans toward longer-form videos. Facebook announced it would begin prioritizing longer videos that drive repeat viewership in December 2017, as part of its larger strategy to cultivate more \"lean-back\" viewers for its Watch section. In contrast, Netflix's short-form push can help the company gain more casual mobile viewers, who are consuming short-form video on Facebook and YouTube instead.  Netflix's short-form push comes as the company is adding subscribers at a rapid clip.The company beat analyst expectations and added 8.3 million subscribers globally in Q4 2017, bringing its total subscriber count to 118 million. The company plans on spending up to $8 billion and $2 billion on content and marketing in 2018, respectively, to help sustain subscriber growth.

Rodriguez/Getty  Netflix shares are spiking after the company announced a deal with \"Glee\" and \"American Horror Story\" producer Ryan Murphy.  Netflix's fourth-quarter revenue beat was \"fueled by our original content,\" according to the streaming giant.    Netflix shares are spiking Wednesday after the streaming giant announced a deal with Ryan Murphy, the producer of \"Glee\" and \"American Horror Story,\" reportedly worth up to $300 million over five years.  Netflix's stock is trading up more than 3% to above $266 a share. Netflix shares hit an all-time high of $284 in late January.  Murphy will remain with 21st Century Fox through the end of his current contract this summer, and Disney's pending acquisition of several Fox businesses was reportedly a factor in his decision to leave the traditional television studio for Netflix, according to The New York Times.  This is Netflix's latest move to steal top producers from traditional television in order to create original content as it competes with other streaming giants like Hulu, Apple, and Amazon. Last August, Netflix signed a deal with Shonda Rhimes, the producer behind ABC's hit shows \"Grey's Anatomy\" and \"Scandal.\"  Netflix said it will spend up to $8 billion this year on original content, which comes as no surprise to investors who have grown accustomed to Netflix's propensity to spend big. By comparison, Apple said it will only spend $1 billion on original content.  After Netflix beat Wall Street estimates on revenue for the fourth-quarter, the company said in its earnings report that the strong revenue was \"fueled by our original content.\"  Markets Insider", "stock": "NFLX", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-14", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/netflix-stock-price-jumps-after-deal-with-ryan-murphy-2018-2-1015778302"}, {"article": "Netflix  While some investors may be wary about Netflix's estimated billions-of-dollars in spending on new and original content, one Wall Street analyst believes Netflix can back it up with its brand.  Viewers often have positive feelings about Netflix movies and TV shows even before they've seen them, which should help the streaming giant keep a healthy pace in subscriber growth, Bernstein analyst Todd Juenger says.  Watch Netflix's stock move in real time here.  When video watchers hear Netflix is behind a movie or TV show, they most often conclude that it has to be good, or at least worth the minimal investment of time to check it out.  That positive association with Netflix's brand could be hard for competitors to beat, and could help justify its estimated $12 billion investment in original content.  \"The positive brand association Netflix has created among its members provides a positive halo for its content, giving Netflix a huge advantage because members are pre-disposed to think they will 'like' Netflix content, which usually becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy,\" wrote Todd Juenger, a Bernstein analyst.  With some of its recent successes, such as \"Bright,\" featuring Will Smith, the German production \"Dark,\" and the Oscar award-winning documentary, \"Icarus,\" Netflix has proven that it produces original content that will keep driving new and loyal subscribers back to its platform.  This is also helping the video streaming company draw some key Hollywood talent such as Ryan Murphy, the man behind \"American Horror Story\" and \"Glee,\" and Shonda Rhimes, the producer behind such hits as \"Grey's Anatomy\" and \"Scandal.\" The fact that Netflix is able to pull such high-profile names also keeps them away from competitors, Juenger notes.  \"While the price tag is high, the value of a 'hit show' for Netflix is also high, and it's nice to have your $12 billion in capable hands,\" Juenger said.  Netflix plans to spend billions of dollars on roughly 700 new original TV shows in 2018 as part of its strategy to build \"a global moat\" that would widen its competitive advantage, according to another Wall Street analyst.  In fact, investor confidence was so high for Netflix that a Stifel analyst downgraded the stock, claiming the \"share price may have sprinted ahead of fundamentals in the short-term.\"  Netflix was up 3.78% on Friday at $328.84 per share.

It\u2019s hard to imagine Mr. Rock releasing a club set after hardly any time to refine it, the way Mr. Chappelle did over New Year\u2019s. Mr. Rock is too much of a perfectionist. And while Mr. Chappelle shows up at clubs and spends hours onstage riffing, gathering ideas through free association, Mr. Rock\u2019s process is much more focused and linear, like his comedy.

Whereas Mr. Chappelle escapes tricky territory through sweeping history lessons or literary flourishes, Mr. Rock builds forceful arguments that culminate in precise and memorable epigrams. \u201cPressure makes diamonds, not hugs\u201d is the pithiest defense of bullying you will hear.  Mr. Rock\u2019s booming act has always been built for bigger rooms, but he goes smaller for this special, with the help of the comic Bo Burnham, whose artfully idiosyncratic direction emphasizes intimacy and studiously avoids clich\u00e9. The show begins with a casual shot of the back of Mr. Rock\u2019s head while he is chatting backstage and ends abruptly. When the star drops the microphone, Mr. Burnham fades to black before we hear the familiar sound of it hitting the floor. Crisp images of the front row of the theater, juxtaposed with smoky backdrops and ghostly lighting, make the audience appear on the same level as the performer, creating unusually striking images for stand-up comedy.  In filming just the first joke \u2014 \u201cYou would think that cops would occasionally shoot a white kid, just to make it look good\u201d \u2014 Mr. Burnham shifts angles four times, but he also knows when to stop moving the camera. As Mr. Rock confesses he cheated on his wife, he goes in for the close-up and lingers.  This risks heavy-handedness but displays a perceptive eye for the importance of a pivot point where the star could lose his audience. Kevin Hart, who recently confessed to cheating on his wife before announcing a tour called \u201cIrresponsible,\u201d might face a similar onstage moment soon.  When I saw Mr. Rock play Madison Square Garden in December, he took a few glancing shots at Matt Lauer, the \u201cToday\u201d host who was fired over allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior, but the comic mostly avoided #MeToo as he does in the new special. Though Mr. Rock evoked the movement at one point by shifting from his mistakes with his wife to a broader question: \u201cWhat is wrong with men?\u201d  Over the course of his career, mixing the voice of a preacher with that of a litigator, Mr. Rock has built up an authority skewering the foibles of the world while keeping his own offstage. This special represents a shift in that dynamic. In describing his flaws, Mr. Rock says he was hooked on pornography. There is a lot of comedy about pornography, but to hear a superstar break down how watching it made him \u201csexually autistic\u201d is bracing, and may even provide grist to certain warnings against online porn.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  In that North Carolina show, Mr. Rock went into more detail about his affairs. That was cut from the special, leaving nothing to invite jealousy. His tone is contrite, but it also suggests he has recovered, both from porn addiction and cheating, which he says he\u2019s done with. In an hour dense with jokes, he gets serious. \u201cWhen guys cheat, we want something new,\u201d he says, still in close-up. \u201cBut you know what happens? Your woman finds out and now she\u2019s new. She\u2019s never the same again. You got new but you got a bad new.\u201d  Offstage, Chris Rock is soft-spoken, thoughtful, even shy \u2014 an alter ego to the strutting superhero he becomes in his stand-up specials whose titles (\u201cBigger & Blacker,\u201d \u201cNever Scared\u201d) telegraph swagger. In the age of Trump, he has shifted to something quieter, more humble, and yet, with the same old confidence, with lessons learned at the end.

In this 2003 film, Zellweger plays a tomboyish woman in the beautiful mountains of rural North Carolina who goes to live with a lonely neighbor (Nicole Kidman) who\u2019s waiting for her husband (Jude Law) to come back from the Civil War. Their characters become close friends and rely on each other for survival, which becomes a wonderful (nonromantic) relationship to watch.  \u2014  A scene from \u201cThe Iron Giant.\u201d Warner Bros.  \u2018The Iron Giant\u2019  Starts streaming: April 1  April 1 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Although the robotic star of this movie makes a big cameo in Steven Spielberg\u2019s \u201cReady Player One,\u201d his role in a fight scene in that film presents a sharp contrast with how audiences first met the gentle Iron Giant in 1999. In the original animated film, a boy named Hogarth finds the large robot from outer space during the paranoia-filled age of the Cold War. He is forced to keep his new best friend a secret even though the giant comes in peace. Unloved at the box office during its first run, \u201cThe Iron Giant\u201d later gained a devoted following and helped get its director, Brad Bird, into Pixar Studios, where he went on to make \u201cThe Incredibles.\u201d  \u2014  From left, Roberto Benigni, Giorgio Cantarini and Nicoletta Braschi in \u201cLife Is Beautiful.\u201d Sergio Strizzi/Miramax Films  \u2018Life Is Beautiful\u2019  Starts streaming: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  In this three-time Oscar-winner (one of which resulted in this moment), a Jewish Italian father tries to protect his young son from the horrors of a concentration camp after they are captured by Nazis. Roberto Benigni starred in, wrote and directed the movie, which uses slapstick comedy to balance some of the film\u2019s tragic scenes.  \u2014  0  Corey Feldman, left, and Corey Haim in \u201cThe Lost Boys.\u201d Warner Bros.  \u2018The Lost Boys\u2019  Starts streaming: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Before Joel Schumacher became known as the director behind two of the worst \u201cBatman\u201d sequels (\u201cBatman: Forever\u201d and \u201cBatman & Robin\u201d), he made this thrilling horror-comedy about a group of troublemaking vampires who roam a California boardwalk, seducing victims and squaring off against a group of comic-book nerds. It is delightfully \u201980s in every respect: the hair, the clothes, the kinds of mischief the kids get up to. And then there\u2019s the cast, which includes \u201980s stars like Corey Feldman, Corey Haim, Alex Winter, Dianne Wiest and Kiefer Sutherland, as the leader of the vampire pack.  \u2014  Michelle Pfeiffer and Al Pacino in \u201cScarface.\u201d Universal Pictures, via Everett Collection  \u2018Scarface\u2019  Starts streaming: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  This is the Brian De Palma movie that launched a handful of catchphrases, many bad Al Pacino impressions and countless movie posters on dorm rooms across the country. Written by Oliver Stone, the film follows the ruthless Cuban gangster Tony Montana as he climbs his way up from being a low-level hood to ruling a slice of the Miami drug scene in the decadent \u201980s. In his perverted sense of the American dream, nothing is off limits. It\u2019s a mentality that eventually leads to so many scenes of violence and drug use that it makes \u201cMiami Vice\u201d look like a kid\u2019s show.  \u2014  Netflix Original TV Series  A scene from \u201cChef\u2019s Table: Pastry.\u201d Martin Westlake/Netflix  \u2018Chef\u2019s Table: Pastry\u2019  Starts streaming: April 13  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  TV\u2019s prettiest-looking cooking series gets its second spinoff, focused on four of the world\u2019s most acclaimed dessert-makers: the Milk Bar\u2019s Christina Tosi, Room 4\u2019s Will Goldfarb, El Celler de Can Roca\u2019s Jordi Roca and Caff\u00e8 Sicilia\u2019s Corrado Assenza.

Netflix\u2019s new remake appears to be keeping most of what worked the first time out, albeit with updated special effects and a more modern outlook on gender roles. The comically dour Dr. Smith, for example \u2014 played by Jonathan Harris in the original \u2014 is a woman in this version, and she\u2019s played by a cleverly cast Parker Posey.  \u2014  Robert F.

Kennedy\u2019s life, career and death have been covered extensively in documentaries, movie dramas, and TV mini-series, much more than his brother Robert\u2019s political career and assassination. The four-hour docu-series \u201cBobby Kennedy for President\u201d is an effort to correct that imbalance, using the landmark cultural moment of Kennedy\u2019s 1968 White House run \u2014 and its abrupt, tragic end \u2014 as a lens through which to observe what he stood for and what he meant to a generation of young idealists.  \u2014  Also of interest: \u201cThe Boss Baby: Back in Business\u201d Season 1 (April 6), \u201cThe Magic School Bus Rides Again\u201d Season 2 (April 13), \u201cThe Chalet\u201d Season 1 (April 17), \u201cDope\u201d Season 2 (April 20).

Directed by Joshua Marston and written by Marcus Hinchey, the film is intended as a bracing challenge to fervent Christian believers, asking them to consider the true purpose of their faith.  \u2014  From left, Ed Harris, Elizabeth Olsen and Jason Sudeikis in \u201cKodachrome.\u201d Christos Kalohoridis/Netflix  \u2018Kodachrome\u2019  Starts streaming: April 20  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Based on a true story, the indie dramedy \u201cKodachrome\u201d stars Ed Harris as a cranky, ill old man who takes a road trip with his compassionate nurse (Elizabeth Olsen) and his estranged son (Jason Sudeikis), in order to drop off some undeveloped rolls of film at the last lab in the country that can process them. Similarities to the recent Oscar nominee \u201cNebraska\u201d are unmistakable, but this move has its own tone and rhythm, paying off in some satisfyingly emotional moments.  \u2014  0  A scene from \u201cMercury 13.\u201d via Netflix  \u2018Mercury 13\u2019  Starts streaming: April 20  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  In 1960, not long after NASA publicly announced the names of the seven pilots who became the first American men in space \u2014 the so-called Mercury Seven \u2014 a private organization started recruiting women to undergo some of the same psychological and physical tests administered to those men. The purpose: to see if the challenges of flying beyond Earth\u2019s atmosphere differed by gender. The documentary \u201cMercury 13\u201d is a look into this lesser-known project, considering the way the codified sexism of the post-World War II era denied a one-of-a-kind opportunity to some would-be (and perfectly capable) adventurers.  \u2014  Chris Rock, left, and Adam Sandler in \u201cThe Week Of.\u201d Netflix  \u2018The Week Of\u2019  Sarts streaming: April 27  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  For the most part, the movies that Adam Sandler has delivered to Netflix as part of his recent four-picture deal have been embarrassingly broad. But there\u2019s reason to hope that this last film in the batch will be the best \u2014 in part because it is directed by the incisive veteran comic Robert Smigel (who also wrote the film with Sandler), and in part because it also stars Sandler\u2019s old \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d castmate Chris Rock. Sandler and Rock play parents who spend an anxious seven days leading up to their kids\u2019 wedding. Rachel Dratch and Steve Buscemi also star, in a film that could potentially hearken to more emotionally complex Sandler projects like \u201cThe Wedding Singer.\u201d  \u2014  Also of interest: \u201cThe 4th Company\u201d (April 6), \u201cAmateur\u201d (April 6), \u201cOrbiter 9\u201d (April 6), \u201cPickpockets\u201d (April 12), \u201cDude\u201d (April 20), \u201cPsychokinesis\u201d (April 25) and \u201cCandy Jar\u201d (April 27).

In the not-too-distant future (1997 \u2014 the film was released in 1981), Air Force One crash lands in the prison colony of Manhattan, and Plissken is enlisted to rescue the president before the crooks who kidnapped him seek revenge. Along with \u201cThe Thing,\u201d this is one of the best 1980s collaborations between Russell and the movie\u2019s director, John Carpenter. Between Russell\u2019s gruff macho-man character, exaggerated villains and dystopian view of New York City, this movie is pretty out there. Breaking up all the seriousness, the classic-movie star Ernest Borgnine shows up for comic relief as an old-school cabdriver looking to help Plissken with his mission.  \u2014  Robert De Niro in \u201cThe King of Comedy.\u201d 20th Century Fox  \u2018The King of Comedy\u2019  Starts streaming: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  In his mind, Rupert Pupkin (Robert De Niro) is a TV star, and he\u2019ll do just about anything to make his dream come true \u2014 including stalking and kidnapping. This is perhaps one of Martin Scorsese\u2019s more understated movies. It doesn\u2019t have the same amount of violence that movies like \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d or \u201cGoodfellas\u201d have. It\u2019s a psychological drama that is tense and sometimes tragically funny.  \u2014  Michelle Pfeiffer and Alec Baldwin in \u201cMarried to the Mob.\u201d MGM  \u2018Married to the Mob\u2019  Starts streaming: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Angela de Marco (Michelle Pfeiffer) has a husband in the mafia (a young and dashing Alec Baldwin), and she wants out. Unfortunately, leaving the mob is harder than breaking a marriage, and Angela is left to defend for herself from gangsters and the feds. The premise sounds bleak, but \u201cMarried to the Mob\u201d is a lively Jonathan Demme romantic comedy that gives Pfeiffer a chance to play for laughs. It\u2019s funny but poignant, bubbly but still dark at times \u2014 all in equal measure so nothing is out of whack.  \u2014  A scene from \u201cParanormal Activity.\u201d Paramount Pictures  \u2018Paranormal Activity\u2019  Starts streaming: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  This is the low-budget found-footage horror film that helped kick off a craze in the late 2000s. Suspecting there\u2019s something strange lurking in their new home, a young couple sets up stationary cameras to capture whatever might be creeping around at night. But the cause of the disturbances is more terrifying than they anticipated.

The central story follows a hard-to-please mother (Sally Field) and her diabetic daughter (Julia Roberts), who despite her fragile health still wants kids. Field and Roberts are amazing, but there isn\u2019t a bad performer in a cast that includes Shirley MacLaine, Daryl Hannah, Olympia Dukakis and Dolly Parton in one of her best onscreen roles.  \u2014  Chavela Vargas as seen in \u201cChavela.\u201d Music Box Films  \u2018Chavela\u2019  Starts streaming: April 2  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  For those not familiar with the Mexican musician Chavela Vargas, let this inspiring documentary be your guide. She was a pants-wearing pioneer in an era when Mexican women didn\u2019t sing ranchera music onstage without wearing super frilly dresses. But Vargas ditched the costume, picked up a guitar and sang haunting songs of longing and loss. This documentary goes to great lengths to explain the mysterious Vargas through old interviews and recordings, but it can sometimes feel as if she\u2019s just out of reach. She\u2019s keeping some secrets to herself.  \u2014  0  From left, Christopher Rivera, Brooklynn Prince and Valeria Cotto in \u201cThe Florida Project.\u201d A24  \u2018The Florida Project\u2019  Starts streaming: April 6  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Sean Baker made a splash at Sundance a few years ago with \u201cTangerine,\u201d a sun-drenched, foul-mouthed comedy starring two transgender actresses and shot with an iPhone. His follow-up, \u201cThe Florida Project,\u201d is no less daring. Set amid a string of pastel-colored roadside motels in Orlando, Fla., just outside the Happiest Place on Earth, the movie follows a precocious 6-year-old troublemaker named Moonee (Brooklynn Prince) as she and her friends wreak havoc and her quick-tempered mother (Bria Vinaite) tries to keep up with the rent. Willem Dafoe gives a career-best performance as their motel\u2019s beleaguered manager, who becomes a kind of surrogate father to Moonee.  \u2014  Also of interest: \u201cBasic Instinct\u201d (April 1), \u201cCarrie\u201d (April 1), \u201cFor a Few Dollars More\u201d (April 1), \u201cFriday the 13th\u201d (April 1), \u201cThe Karate Kid\u201d (April 1), \u201cMarathon Man\u201d (April 1), \u201cMystic River\u201d (April 1), \u201cPhiladelphia\u201d (April 1), \u201cProject Nim\u201d (April 1) and \u201cSpaceballs\u201d (April 1).

In it, Cage plays a convict and former soldier who is on his way out of jail when the plane he is on gets hijacked by his fellow inmates. Of course, it wouldn\u2019t be a \u201990s Cage action movie without lots of fighting, over-the-top explosions and some pithy one-liners.  \u2014  Meryl Streep in \u201cDeath Becomes Her.\u201d Mary Evans/Universal Pictures, via Everett Collection  \u2018Death Becomes Her\u2019  Starts streaming: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Meryl Streep is at her funniest in this little black comedy about jealousy and magic. In it, Streep plays Madeline, a gorgeous movie star who steals the handsome fianc\u00e9 (Bruce Willis) of the much plainer Helen (Goldie Hawn), thus setting a disastrous course for both women. Their jealousy drives them to dark magic, which has some interesting physical side effects. \u201cDeath Becomes Her\u201d has a lighthearted, macabre sense of humor, full of morbid slapstick stunts and neck-twisting pratfalls. But it is also a bittersweet comedy about female friendships and impossible beauty standards.  \u2014  From left, Omar Sharif and Peter O\u2019Toole in \u201cLawrence of Arabia.\u201d Columbia Pictures  \u2018Lawrence of Arabia\u2019  Starts streaming: April 1  April 1 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  This 1962 war epic from director David Lean is on a lot of \u201cbest movies\u201d lists \u2014 and with good reason.

But it isn\u2019t. As Polley peels back the layers of her own family\u2019s history, there\u2019s a kind of \u201cRashomon\u201d effect that happens as old family myths unravel and stories shift perspective.

Thus truly began a long-promised deluge of what the kids call \u201ccontent,\u201d and just how much original content Netflix will put up before the year is over is something not even Netflix can say.  The influx of original programs coincides with news reports about Netflix\u2019s thorny relationship with cinema. The Cannes Film Festival, making good on a pledge last year, has codified its ban on Netflix-produced films in its competition. (If it\u2019s a Netflix movie, it will not screen in competition.) This is because of what Cannes regards as Netflix\u2019s intransigence about showing its films in theaters. Add to that a recent interview with the director Steven Spielberg in which he said that films produced by Netflix and other streaming platforms ought not to be eligible for Oscar consideration but compete for the Emmy Awards instead. That brings the immortal question \u201cWhat Is Cinema?\u201d to the forefront yet again. Along with it are the debates over the ostensibly sacrosanct value of the Communal Theatrical Experience.  It\u2019s not this column\u2019s job to provide definitive answers to the questions these debates raise.

It\u2019s a peculiar grab bag of ideas and visual modes, and Mr. Jones has said it was influenced by his impressions of Berlin during his childhood, when he spent time there with his father, David Bowie, in the \u201970s.

Last season we shot in the winter, and it got darker in many ways. And now in Season 5, even more than in 4, it\u2019s very much more serialized and intense, while still obviously maintaining comedy first. It goes deeper than we ever have in the friendship.  Amy Poehler is an executive producer of the show. And until this coming season, so was her manager, Dave Becky, who has been criticized for ignoring sexual misconduct allegations against his client Louis C.K.  It just didn\u2019t feel right to have his name on a show that represents the exact opposite of what was going on with Louis.  Do you have your own #MeToo moment?  I don\u2019t have a major story particularly to tell, but there are so many stories within my story. The world of comedy is definitely a boys\u2019 club.

But it is a kind of alternative TV dimension, overlaying and replicating the known world of traditional television, that tries to acquire one of everything that exists in the universe of TV.  Initially, the company did this through literal acquisition: buying streaming rights to hit TV series. Then it did it through imitation: reviving Fox\u2019s \u201cArrested Development\u201d and creating originals, like \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d in the mold of premium cable. Now it\u2019s imitating through acquisition, spiriting away the likes of Mr. Murphy and Ms. Rhimes to its well-remunerated plane.  The history of TV is one of upstarts and competitors, and my first instinct was to liken Netflix to something like cable, which rose as a serious competitor to broadcast TV in the 1980s.  But there\u2019s an important difference between cable channels and Netflix (besides whom you write your check to). Cable channels have brands. That was what made them different from broadcast networks, which tried to be, and had to be, everything. Cable channels had specialties and sensibilities: CNN was news; ESPN was sports; HBO was adult sophistication (give or take an \u201cEntourage\u201d).  Photo  A cable brand might evolve \u2014 Bravo went from an arts channel to the \u201cReal Housewives\u201d channel \u2014 but the idea was to offer a specific aesthetic to a specific audience.  Netflix doesn\u2019t have that; in fact, it is specifically anti-that. Its brand is \u201cstuff that you like to watch on TV.\u201d It developed a vast library of reruns, and with that, a proprietary trove of data on who likes to watch what and how much. Then it made more of that, or bought it. If you liked \u201c30 Rock,\u201d here\u2019s \u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.\u201d If you liked \u201cDamages,\u201d here\u2019s \u201cBloodline.\u201d  Look at just the past few months of Netflix programming.

The obvious analogy, then, is that Netflix isn\u2019t cable at all; it\u2019s a broadcaster, pitching a big tent.  But, as I\u2019ve written before, there\u2019s one very important difference. Broadcasters, whose advertising model required millions of eyeballs on every individual show, had to make sure that everything they aired appealed to a broad range of people.  That business imperative had aesthetic results: It gave us family sitcoms and comfort-food cop dramas. It\u2019s less true today, in the era of smaller audiences \u2014 but it\u2019s still much more true of NBC than, say, of IFC.

It\u2019s selling a platform to everyone, but by providing products for very specific tastes.  Netflix assumes a future in which we\u2019re watching our faves on our own screens, rather than gathering around an electronic fireplace \u2014 and as long as the monthly payment clears, it\u2019s all the same to the company. It\u2019s less a big tent than a Dothraki tent city, to borrow a metaphor from \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d  What does this mean for Ryan Murphy and Shonda Rhimes? Maybe not much at all. They were both powerful producers with a lot of freedom who will now have a lot of freedom and more money.  Photo  Mr. Murphy was, in a way, the Netflix-iest of producers to begin with: He\u2019d made everything from a broadcast network sitcom (\u201cThe New Normal\u201d) to an action show (\u201c9-1-1\u201d) to a marquee cable drama (\u201cFeud\u201d) to an HBO film (\u201cThe Normal Heart\u201d). He may be able to branch out even more, but he was hardly fettered.  What Ms. Rhimes does at Netflix will be interesting. She\u2019s the consummate network TV producer, having essentially defined the current voice of ABC with \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d and \u201cScandal.\u201d  She might do something very different with the license of streaming \u2014 but if she doesn\u2019t, that will fit in all the same at Netflix, which resurrected the broadcast favorite \u201cGilmore Girls\u201d with much the same tone, give or take a few curse words. One curious thing about Netflix is that every sensibility \u2014 niche and mass, G-rated and NSFW \u2014 exists on the same platform and the same plane.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Is all the deal-making worth it? Whether Netflix is emptying its deep pockets wisely by making itself into a Hall of Fame for established stars (see also Dave Chappelle) isn\u2019t my concern as a TV critic.  What I do care about is whether Netflix can nurture original, distinctive art, especially if it continues growing into a huge, all-encompassing alterna-TV.  And I worry whether it can do that when derivation is the business strategy itself: selling people new versions of things they already like. It\u2019s fine that Netflix can toss around enough money to reactivate David Letterman. But does it have the kind of culture that could discover a new David Letterman?  In its short life as an original programmer. Netflix has made a few series I\u2019d consider legitimately great. But most of them have involved making deals with creators with limited track records (\u201cBoJack Horseman,\u201d \u201cAmerican Vandal\u201d) or talented artists relatively new to creating series (\u201cMaster of None,\u201d \u201cLady Dynamite\u201d). (As I\u2019ve also written before, these shows tend to be comedies, which may translate more directly and easily to the streaming format.)  A more familiar experience on Netflix is the good-enough version of a drama you\u2019ve seen elsewhere. \u201cGodless,\u201d say, was a perfectly decent dark western, but no \u201cDeadwood.\u201d \u201cStranger Things\u201d is a joy, but it\u2019s a pastiche by design: It\u2019s the Netflix ethos in story form, reproducing and remixing memories in ways that tickle just the right nostalgia pleasure centers.  It may be that Netflix\u2019s approach means more competence and fewer out-and-out stinkers.

After being criticized for how the series\u2019 first season depicted suicide, which had already led the network to add warning messages to the show, Netflix commissioned a study by the Northwestern University Center on Media and Human Development to gauge its impact on viewers. The show\u2019s second season will be released this year.  According to a statement from Netflix, the study showed that \u201cnearly three-quarters of teen and young adult viewers said the show made them feel more comfortable processing tough topics.\u201d  However, the results also showed that Netflix could do more to respond to the concerns of parents, the company said. In a statement, Brian Wright, Netflix\u2019s vice president of original series, said, \u201cResearch indicated the majority of parents felt that while the show brought up important topics, they wanted more resources from us.\u201d  In response to the study\u2019s findings, Netflix created a warning video that will run before each season. The video, which features the show\u2019s actors out of character, explains that the series deals with issues including sexual assault, substance abuse and suicide. It suggests that if a viewer is struggling with these issues, he or she may want to avoid the show or watch it with a trusted adult.  Netflix has also added a viewing guide to the website 13reasonswhy.info that is intended to help facilitate conversations between parents and teenagers about difficult topics.

The restaurant visits and chef interviews are broken up with fake commercials, animations, film clips and parodies of Japanese TV comedies or the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d Julia-Child-bleeds-out skit. The season finale is structured as a debate between Mr. Chang and the chef Mario Carbone over the relative merits of Italian filled pastas and Asian dumplings.  These techniques, and a generous Netflix budget, are on display in the pizza episode, which was filmed in Brooklyn, Tokyo, New Haven, Copenhagen, Naples, Los Angeles and Las Vegas. Demonstrating his trademark contrarianism, Mr. Chang praises Domino\u2019s \u2014 even donning the company vest and delivering pies \u2014 and declares New Haven and then Tokyo as the homes of the world\u2019s best pizza.  The visual curlicues and the attempts to impose a larger thematic structure and narrative \u2014 there\u2019s an awful lot of tired talk about how food tells stories \u2014 don\u2019t hide the reality that there isn\u2019t a whole lot new or surprising about \u201cUgly Delicious.\u201d (The exception: the openness with which it discusses racism as a fundamental force in culinary culture.) Its primary influence, as with other food shows, will probably be to max out reservations at impossibly cool-looking restaurants like the Tokyo pizzeria Seirinkan or the locavorish Salare in Seattle.  What the show is really selling is the Chang attitude and mystique, a combination of ego, exactitude, foul-mouthed rebelliousness and self-deprecatory nerdiness. With the opening of Momofuku Noodle Bar 14 years ago, he fortuitously caught the waves of both millennial casualness and fangirl-fanboy-style fetishization (of ingredients, of methods, of chefs) that swept through the restaurant business.

An important part of Mr. Chang\u2019s persona at the start was his outsider status, casting stones at (or at least making withering remarks about) the bastions of haute cuisine where he had learned his trade. That became problematic as he built an international restaurant empire that recently added the 200-plus-seat Momofuku Las Vegas.  And in \u201cUgly Delicious\u201d he moves with a band of insiders that includes Mr. Meehan, the superstar Danish chef Ren\u00e9 Redzepi and Mr. Ansari, Mr. Chang\u2019s fellow Netflix star. It\u2019s also a boy\u2019s club. An episode about home cooking is the only one with an equal representation of women and men among the significant speaking roles. In all the others men outnumber women by 2 or 3 to 1; in the pizza episode it\u2019s 8 to 1. This may reflect the state of affairs in the food industry, but it\u2019s surprising for a series that wants to talk about diversity and representation.  (African-American chefs and commentators are even less present, appearing almost exclusively in an episode about the coded meanings and cultural signifiers of fried chicken.)  The show often allows Mr. Chang\u2019s rough edges to show, and sometimes its picture of him is unflattering in ways that don\u2019t seem intentional. His jibes can cross over into meanness, and his pontifications can appear oblivious, as when he compares the art of barbecue to the art of jazz in an episode focused entirely on white and Asian cooks.  \u201cI don\u2019t know how the hell it all happened,\u201d Mr. Chang says, contemplating the franchise that he has become. The claim seems unlikely, and one way to see the show, with its focus on pizza and tacos and dumplings, is as a branding exercise \u2014 a pivot away from high-intensity cooking toward the ugly deliciousness of comfort food. The penultimate episode ends with him holding a plate of kimchi and Spam fried rice toward the camera. In the Chang vernacular, it looks bonkers, and you\u2019ll want to crush it.", "stock": "NFLX", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-23", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/23/arts/television/ugly-delicious-review-david-chang-netflix.html"}, {"article": "Watching is The New York Times\u2019s TV and film recommendation website.

Here are 12 great movies and TV shows leaving Netflix in March.  A scene from \u201cJaws.\u201d Universal Pictures  \u2018Jaws\u2019  Leaving Netflix: March 1  : March 1 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  This 1975 horror thriller from Steven Spielberg did nothing less than revolutionize the movie industry \u2014 once studio executives realized exactly how much money could be made by a single summer blockbuster, it changed the way movies were released and advertised. But that\u2019s not the reason to see it (or see it again); it was a hit then, and it has endured for more than four decades because it is a masterfully constructed adventure ride, filled with bruising set pieces, eerily convincing effects, quotable dialogue (they are, in fact, gonna need a bigger boat), and memorable characters. Ultimately, we care about this ragtag crew of would-be shark hunters, which renders their breathless encounters with the great white all them more compelling.  \u2014  Guy Pearce in \u201cMemento.\u201d Danny Rothenberg/Newmarket Films  \u2018Memento\u2019  Leaving Netflix: March 1  : March 1 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Christopher Nolan\u2019s second feature \u2014 and first big hit \u2014 is an expertly constructed windup toy of a movie, spinning an exhilarating 113 minutes out of a fairly simple premise: A man with short-term memory loss (Guy Pearce), tries to solve his wife\u2019s murder. But Nolan augments the storytelling with an appropriate stylistic flourish, presenting it in reverse chronological order, so that in each new scene, the viewer is as uncertain about what\u2019s happening as the protagonist. Replete with neo-noir styling and a cast of top-notch character actors (including Joe Pantoliano, Carrie-Anne Moss, and Stephen Tobolowsky), \u201cMemento\u201d is a deliciously inventive mystery with a potent dose of melancholy right under its surface.  \u2014  Kitty Winn and Al Pacino in \u201cThe Panic in Needle Park.\u201d 20th Century Fox  \u2018The Panic in Needle Park\u2019  Leaving Netflix: March 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Before \u201cSerpico,\u201d before \u201cDog Day Afternoon,\u201d before even \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d Al Pacino made his big-screen breakthrough in this 1971 drug drama from director Jerry Schatzberg (\u201cStreet Smart\u201d). As a heroin addict and street hustler whose nights and days are an endless search for money, drugs or both, Pacino is both scarily convincing and offhandedly charismatic; you get a sense of why his new girlfriend, Helen (Kitty Winn, also terrific), would fall for him, and also why she should stay far away. Joan Didion and John Gregory Dunne\u2019s low-to-the-ground script and Schatzberg\u2019s gritty, neorealist-inspired photography create scenes that feel less written and staged than overheard and captured, resulting in an uncomfortable but powerful viewing experience.  \u2014  Natasha Lyonne in \u201cSlums of Beverly Hills.\u201d Fox Searchlight Pictures  \u2018The Slums of Beverly Hills\u2019  Leaving Netflix: March 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  American comedies don\u2019t deal in matters of class nearly as much as they could (and should), which is part of what makes this 1998 comedy from the writer-director Tamara Jenkins (\u201cThe Savages\u201d) unique, and valuable. Set in 1976, it concerns a lower-income family\u2019s attempts to keep the kids in good schools by dwelling in sketchy apartments right on the edge of Beverly Hills. Alan Arkin is a marvel as the hyper-neurotic patriarch, and David Krumholtz is uproariously funny as the unreasonably confident older son. But the showcase performer is Natasha Lyonne, warm and winning as the teenager daughter in the midst of a poorly-timed sexual awakening.  \u2014  0  A scene from \u201cThe Craft.\u201d Columbia Pictures  \u2018The Craft\u2019  Leaving Netflix: March 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Misfits and weirdos will love this 1996 supernatural thriller-drama, in which a nervous new girl (Robin Tunney) at a Catholic boarding school turns to a trio of outcasts (Neve Campbell, Fairuza Balk and Rachel True) for friendship, and their tight-knit group turns into a witches\u2019 coven. The witty script (by Peter Filardi and director Andrew Fleming) nicely quenches one\u2019s thirst for teenage vengeance, with all the proper parties getting their deserved comeuppance. But it\u2019s not just a gimmick movie; all four protagonists create distinctive characters of genuine depth, lending weight to what could have been a throwaway genre exercise.  \u2014  Eva Mendes and Will Smith in \u201cHitch.\u201d Columbia Pictures  \u2018Hitch\u2019  Leaving Netflix: March 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Between \u201cIndependence Day,\u201d \u201cMen in Black\u201d and \u201cI Am Legend,\u201d Will Smith got so good at saving the world, he rarely got the chance to flex his considerable romantic charm. This 2005 hit filled that niche a bit, casting Smith as a relationship expert and one-on-one date coach whose latest client (a sweet and likable Kevin James) is something of a challenge \u2014 one that arrives just as he meets (and finds himself atypically tongue-tied around) the woman of his own dreams (Eva Mendes). Director Andy Tennant mines plenty of laughs from Smith\u2019s built-in swagger and James\u2019s customary oafishness, and he also has a great time turning those personas inside out. Smith and Mendes generate real chemistry, provoking a genuine rooting interest in the midst of this lightweight romp.  \u2014  Marlon Brando in \u201cThe Chase.\u201d Horizon Pictures  \u2018The Chase\u2019  Leaving Netflix: March 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  A knockout ensemble cast \u2014 including Marlon Brando, Jane Fonda, Robert Redford, Robert Duvall and Angie Dickinson \u2014 assembles for this swampy, boozy, atmospheric thriller, in which a small town is rocked by a prison escape that unlocks their secret affairs, desires and lesser instincts. The pacing is a little punchy and the proceedings are a tad overheated, but it\u2019s worth a watch for the skill of the performers (Brando is particularly strong as a sheriff who\u2019s rapidly approaching the end of his rope) and for the inventive direction of Arthur Penn, whom we see tinkering with some of the thematic and stylistic interests he harvested to greater effect for his next film, \u201cBonnie and Clyde.\u201d  \u2014  Mireille Enos and Joel Kinnaman, right, in \u201cThe Killing.\u201d Chris Large/AMC  \u2018The Killing\u2019 (Seasons 1-2)  Leaving Netflix: March 13  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Normally, the removal of the first two seasons of a mystery serial would be a real bummer. But this four-season crime drama is something of an exception, as the split between Season 2 and Season 3 signaled the end of one story (and the end of an era, changing out all but two of the key cast members, which happened again for the fourth) and the beginning of the next. The first two years of the series, based on the Danish crime show \u201cForbrydelsen,\u201d tell a story about the murder of a Seattle teen in meticulous detail \u2014 each episode covers just 24 hours of the investigation. Taut and disturbing, intricate and moody, \u201cThe Killing\u201d is the kind of meaty crime drama that sticks to your ribs.  \u2014  Clockwise from top left: Cyril Figgis, Krieger, Cheryl, Pam Poovey, Sterling Archer and Ray Gillette in \u201cArcher.\u201d FX  \u2018Archer\u2019 (Seasons 1-7)  Leaving Netflix: March 14  : March 14 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  When it began in 2009, this animated FX comedy from Adam Reed sounded like a one-joke premise, and not exactly a fresh one either: an extended spoof on James Bond-style spy stories, set at a secret intelligence agency during an indeterminate and anachronistic pseudo-Cold War period. And yet it took flight (eight seasons and counting) thanks to the show\u2019s frisky writing, winking self-awareness, willingness to reboot itself entirely (full seasons have reset the narrative as a \u201cMiami Vice\u201d spoof and a private eye yarn), and most of all, the skills of the uproarious voice cast, including the \u201cArrested Development\u201d star Jessica Walters as another unstable mother and the \u201cBob\u2019s Burgers\u201d gem H. Jon Benjamin as the boozing, womanizing title character.  \u2014  From left, Judy Hopps (voiced by Ms. Goodwin) and Nick Wilde (voiced by Jason Bateman) in \u201cZootopia.\u201d Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures  \u2018Zootopia\u2019  Leaving Netflix: March 20  : March 20 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  On the surface, there shouldn\u2019t be anything particularly revelatory about a Disney movie with cuddly talking animals. What\u2019s fresh and fascinating about this 2016 smash Byron Howard and Rich Moore, however, is the way it takes the conventions of those movies and injects them with a subtle dose of social commentary \u2014 without turning preachy or detracting from its surface pleasures. Ginnifer Goodwin is plucky and charming as Judy Hopps, a bunny cop in a utopian city who is drawn into a mysterious case wherein tame animals are reverting to their wilder instincts. Jason Bateman is a marvelous counterpoint as the con-artist fox who leads her into the city\u2019s criminal underworld, creating a buddy cop dynamic that recalls \u201c48 HRS.\u201d as much as \u201cBambi.\u201d  \u2014  From left, Roger Rabbit (voiced by Charles Fleischer) and Bob Hoskins in \u201cWho Framed Roger Rabbit.\u201d Walt Disney Studios  \u2018Who Framed Roger Rabbit\u2019  Leaving Netflix: March 24  : March 24 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  \u201cZootopia\u201d wasn\u2019t Disney\u2019s first tale about crime-solving anthropomorphic mammals in the big city. One of its biggest hits of the 1980s was this clever story about cartoon animals and cynical humans who exist together in 1940s Los Angeles, where the movie star Roger Rabbit is accused of murdering a local tycoon. He hires Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins), a hard-boiled private eye, to clear his name, and they embark on a hilarious investigation of the animated movie industry, with cameo appearances by iconic characters from not only the Disney stable but also those of Warner Brothers, Max Fleischer and Walter Lantz. It\u2019s a treat for movie buffs and cartoon aficionados. It\u2019s also an entertaining potboiler, dipping into the juicy, \u201cChinatown\u201d-like mysteries and scandals of postwar Hollywood.  \u2014  From left: Waris Ahluwalia, Michael Gambon, Anjelica Huston, Noah Taylor, Bud Cort, Bill Murray, Matthew Gray Gubler, Seu Jorge, Jeff Goldblum, Cate Blanchett, Willem DaFoe in \u201cThe Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou.\u201d Phlippe Antonello/Touchstone Pictures  0  \u2018The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou\u2019  Leaving Netflix: March 26  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Bill Murray stars as Steve Zissou, a Jacques Cousteau-style oceanographer and documentarian, in this frisky yet bittersweet comic drama from director Wes Anderson. Working for the first time with Noah Baumbach (\u201cThe Squid and the Whale,\u201d \u201cFrances Ha\u201d) as his co-writer, Anderson indulges in an absurdist streak that meshes nicely with the familial discord and dry wit of his previous pictures. He also marshals one of his most impressive casts to date, which includes Cate Blanchett, Willem Dafoe, Michael Gambon, Jeff Goldblum, Anjelica Huston and Owen Wilson, who is both touching and goofy as Zissou\u2019s estranged son.  \u2014  Interested in getting suggestions on what to watch?

Going into Season 2, we knew we wanted to end with Lydia having the stroke and that the final episode would be an homage to the \u201cMaud\u201d episode that he and I both love. It\u2019s where everyone gets to do a monologue. So along the way, we knew we wanted to build in some of the stroke stuff. We knew we wanted to have Penelope in a relationship and for it to amicably \u2014 over something like having children \u2014 end. That just felt like something a lot of women I know who are nearing 40 are experiencing.  Same with Elena. We knew we wanted her to have a girlfriend and to start this positive relationship with her. We knew we wanted to make a baby step with Victor [Penelope\u2019s ex-husband and the children\u2019s father, played by James Martinez]. It\u2019s not a complete resolution, but something that seemed hopeful. We came in with those things, sat with the writers, and they tell us what\u2019s going on in their lives and what\u2019s been important. We find a middle ground and break the stories, and that\u2019s that.  The country\u2019s politics have changed since the premiere of Season 1. How did you decide to incorporate that into the show \u2014 like the episode when Alex gets called an ethnic slur?  That was based on a real incident. That happened to my brother at a beach in San Diego. We\u2019ve lived in San Diego for 20 years. He called me up post-Trump, \u201cI was just at the beach, and someone told me to go back to Mexico!\u201d He was laughing about it because he doesn\u2019t care. But it\u2019s like, \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d We try on the show to show many points of view. Obviously, the show has a liberal bent, but we try to show all sides of an issue so all sides of the conversation can start. This is something we thought would affect this family, so how would they talk about it? What would that look like?

My mom had a stroke and didn\u2019t tell me for 12 years! That\u2019s real! I was just talking with her and she said, \u201cAye, when I had a stroke \u2026 \u201d \u201cWait, what stroke?\u201d \u201cAh, your wedding was happening, I didn\u2019t want to bother you.\u201d \u201cOye, mom, you better tell somebody!\u201d All that is real. It seems dramatic, but in a wonderful way in the arms of Rita Moreno, it has that diva turn.  A colleague of mine has written about how the show has this wonderful sense of joy. It feels like a celebration of Cuban culture, Latino identity, the immigrant experience and family. Is that a conscious choice when writing?  Well, that\u2019s just my experience. Really, my house is not a sad place ever. We feel so blessed, we feel so grateful. We have a really good time. In the media, Latino families are always in crisis \u2014 there\u2019s gang violence, people weeping. That\u2019s just not what I know it to be. I wanted to reflect my experience, too, and to throw that in the ring. It seems a lot of people relate to that, too.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Last season, you addressed immigration with Elena\u2019s friend Carmen and her parents\u2019 deportation. This time, you have Lydia and Schneider (Todd Grinnell) going through the citizenship process. Was that something you wanted to keep exploring?  In my family, not all of the Cubans became citizens. My parents became citizens, but I have aunts and uncles who did not. When you become a U.S. citizen, you have to renounce your Cuban citizenship. They\u2019re green card holders \u2014 they pay taxes, social security and they can\u2019t vote. When Trump started deporting people, my cousins got really concerned. \u201cShould we have mom become a citizen?\u201d There was all this worry. What if Lydia had never become a citizen? Then it would be fun to have her and Schneider go on that journey together.  Another story line you kept exploring this season was Penelope\u2019s depression, and how she\u2019s still struggling with the social stigma and the need to rely on antidepressants to help her.  We really wanted to get that right. It also seemed like something veterans really struggle with; Latinos have a lot of issues with discussing it or going on medications. We wanted to explore what that was like for this character. Also, she\u2019s at a great point in her life, so it\u2019s that placebo of \u201cEverything is going great, and I don\u2019t need to do any of this stuff anymore.\u201d Then, we saw what the reality of that looked like for her. She couldn\u2019t talk to her mom about it, and she couldn\u2019t talk to her boyfriend about it because she was embarrassed. It was also a way to deepen her relationship with Schneider because he was the only person she could talk to about it.  Is there a story you\u2019re looking forward to continuing in Season 3?  Well, we have a few things built in already. Penelope is in school, so she still will be in school, or maybe graduate. We get to see her journey to being a nurse practitioner. Seeing what else is out there for her dating life as well. Deepening Elena\u2019s relationship. Maybe Alex will get to have a little love in his life. And of course, we\u2019ll be taking into consideration what's happening in the next month or two months from now.

Photo  Ted Sarandos, the chief content officer at Netflix, laid down the gauntlet five years ago when he said, \u201cThe goal is to become HBO faster than HBO can become us.\u201d  That statement seemed unlikely, coming from an executive who had only recently begun overseeing original programming at a company better known for tucking DVDs into postage-paid red envelopes.  Jump-cut to the present: Netflix is valued at some $115 billion and has 110.6 million subscribers worldwide. It has shown off its might by signing David Letterman to a deal at reportedly $2 million an episode for his new talk show series, giving Chris Rock a reported $40 million for two standup specials and handing Jerry Seinfeld a reported $100 million for his interview program, \u201cComedians in Cars Drinking Coffee,\u201d and standup shows.  Dana Walden, a co-chief executive of the Fox television group, said Mr. Sarandos\u2019s signing of Ms. Rhimes was the deal that had evinced a deep change in Hollywood.  \u201cWhat Ted did was extremely disruptive and sent a message to the entire talent community: These old deals that seemed incredibly lucrative at the time, there\u2019s a new template in town,\u201d Ms. Walden said. \u201cFor any uber-premium creator, the value has gone up 10 times.

While that is no match for Netflix, the company has seen growth in each of the last two quarters.  Apple is the wild card. The company has been buying projects at breakneck speed as it begins to shell out more than $1 billion on original programming.

With the old Hollywood model disrupted, or perhaps broken, Disney, Fox, CBS, Viacom and Time Warner have moved to gain scale in their efforts to compete against the deep-pocketed upstarts.  Pending governmental approval, Disney will acquire much of 21st Century Fox in a $52.4 billion deal that the two companies reached in December. CBS and Viacom, which were part of the same corporation from 2000 to 2006, are in talks to reunite. And AT&T is working to purchase Time Warner \u2014 a deal that is in jeopardy because of a lawsuit filed by the Justice Department to block it on antitrust grounds.  The mergers and acquisitions taking place in the background are, for now, a destabilizing force in the entertainment industry \u2014 one that likely contributed to Mr. Murphy\u2019s decision to leave old Hollywood for the streaming space.  Photo  \u201cWere the Disney deal to have never happened, I think he would have been close to a new deal with us,\u201d said Ms. Walden, the Fox executive who has worked closely with Mr. Murphy. \u201cIf the Disney move happened a year ago, and the transaction was completed by now and we were part of the Disney Company, I think he would be part of us.\u201d  Mr. Murphy declined to comment for this article.  Disney \u2014 a part-owner of Hulu that is building new streaming services under its chief executive, Robert A. Iger \u2014 has repeatedly cited 21st Century Fox\u2019s ability to create popular programming as one of the main reasons it sought to acquire it from Rupert Murdoch. Disney\u2019s own television studio has not been a reliable supplier.  The day after losing Mr. Murphy to Netflix, John Landgraf, the chief executive of FX, which is part of 21st Century Fox, pointed to his cable network\u2019s long record of producing talent, including Donald Glover (\u201cAtlanta\u201d) and Pamela Adlon (\u201cBetter Things\u201d).  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  \u201cWith more than 20 scripted original series on our schedule or upcoming, FX has a very successful track record of identifying and developing talented writers who have produced award-winning hit shows, and it will continue to do so,\u201d he said.  The money aside, Mr. Murphy may have decided that he had a better chance of creating new shows with minimal interference from above at Netflix, rather than at a Disneyfied version of 21st Century Fox. Referring to Disney\u2019s agreement to acquire much of the company at a news media event last month, the producer said: \u201cWhen this deal first went down, I got a call from the Murdochs and I got a call from Mr. Iger. And I said point-blank, you know, the stuff that I do is not specifically Disney, and I\u2019m interested in that and I\u2019m concerned about that.\u201d  The Murphy deal is a distillation of what may prove to be a once-in-a-generation Hollywood moment. He was looking for security at a time when the old-line companies had yet to take the expanded form they are likely to assume in the next year \u2014 and when the streaming services are spending in manic style.  And it helps that Mr. Murphy has become a Netflix obsessive in his own right.  \u201cAll Ryan has watched for the last year has been Netflix,\u201d said Ms. Walden, who is the godmother to Mr. Murphy\u2019s children. \u201cHe loves their Y.A. series, he loves their documentaries, he watched \u2018The OA\u2019 and loved it, he loved \u201813 Reasons Why,\u2019 he admires the brand, the programming. It was the right timing and right company for him.\u201d  The question now is: How long will the streaming companies continue to spend in a George Streinbrenner-like fashion for talent? Last month, Netflix told investors that it had generated a net income of more than $559 million in 2017, but said its free cash flow was negative $2 billion \u2014 a figure that could balloon to $4 billion this year, the company said.", "stock": "NFLX", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-15", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/14/business/media/streaming-wars-ryan-murphy.html"}, {"article": "\u201cIt\u2019s such a beautiful thing that you don\u2019t have to waste,\u201d he said of the oft-discarded end of the cheese block.

Any queer loves a grilled cheese, but it\u2019s not a revelation to cut it into four triangular pieces.\u201d  Mr. Porowski, 33, said that he tries his best to ignore the noise, but admitted that it hurts to hear, not least because he knows that an act as elementary as cutting open a fruit can be eye-opening for some people.  \u201cTom Jackson never saw the inside of an avocado before,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had all these other components that we made for that food demo that I wanted to show him how to make if we had a chance to.

Netflix threatens to move the movie business onto our television screens and laptops. Film attendance in the United States is at its lowest level in 23 years. Only the occasional superhero makes real money.  But don\u2019t tell that to the intrepid programmers of New York, who somehow keep the city\u2019s multiplexes, art houses, archives, film societies and cultural centers awash in festivals and specialty series. Fighting the twin tides of online streaming and comic-book blockbusters, they\u2019re the real heart of the New York moviegoing experience.

Havana Film Festival New York, \u201cIndestructible: The Soul of Salsa\u201d  The Spanish flamenco singer Diego el Cigala, known for blending European and Afro-Cuban traditions, travels to Havana; San Juan, P.R.; Miami; New York; and Cali, Colombia, to talk about the past and (shaky) present of salsa, perform with collaborators like Gonzalo Rubalcaba and the Fania All-Stars, and perhaps snare some of the \u201cBuena Vista Social Club\u201d audience. Typical of its genre, this celebratory documentary balances infomercial tendencies with potent nostalgia and infectious music. April 11 and 13, AMC Loews 34th Street.

This 1963 Czech rarity, based on a novel by (who else) Stanislaw Lem, presents space travel as a contemplative affair punctuated by swinging cocktail dances.

Tom Hanks in \u201cApollo 13.\u201d Universal Pictures  \u2018Apollo 13\u2019  Leaving Netflix: April 1  April 1 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  There\u2019s no greater testament to the skill and craft of this 1995 smash from Ron Howard than the fact that he manages to build (and sustain, for two-plus hours) tension and suspense around an event with a widely known outcome. That event is the Apollo 13 lunar mission in 1970, intended to be the third manned landing on the moon but aborted after a mechanical failure that put the lives of its three astronauts in jeopardy. Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon and Bill Paxton project credible professionalism in those roles, finding the proper, fleeting moments to let their understandable fear and frustration blast through; an Oscar-nominated Ed Harris is brilliant as the flight director on the ground, marshaling the minds tasked with bringing their boys home.  \u2014  Michael Keaton, left, and Jack Nicholson in \u201cBatman.\u201d Warner Bros., via Everett Collection  \u2018Batman\u2019 / \u2018Batman Returns\u2019  Leaving Netflix: April 1  Once upon a time, a big-budget, big-screen adaptation of a popular comic book was actually a big deal. But the attraction to Tim Burton\u2019s 1989 \u201cBatman\u201d wasn\u2019t just its subject, but its style: The Gothically-inclined Burton (\u201cBatman\u201d was released between \u201cBeetlejuice\u201d and \u201cEdward Scissorhands\u201d) followed the lead of the graphic novels by Frank Miller, eschewing the fizzy, cartoon-pop sensibility of the \u201960s television series (and its film spinoff) and crafting a decidedly darker take on the Dark Knight, casting Michael Keaton against type in the title role opposite a riveting (and scenery-chewing) Jack Nicholson as the Joker. It was so successful, Burton was given more even freedom on its 1992 follow-up, which takes Gotham into grimmer territory thanks to Danny DeVito\u2019s freakish take on the Penguin and Michelle Pfeiffer\u2019s sizzling turn as Catwoman.  \u2014  A scene from \u201cCaddyshack.\u201d Warner Bros.  \u2018Caddyshack\u2019  Leaving Netflix: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  One of the most quotable comedies of the modern era (\u201cCinderella story,\u201d \u201cBe the ball,\u201d \u201cSo I got that goin\u2019 for me, which is nice\u201d), this 1980 favorite from director Harold Ramis (\u201cGroundhog Day\u201d) often feels like channel surfing between several movies at once: a W.C. Fields-style personality comedy starring Rodney Dangerfield; a wiseguy, post-\u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 vehicle for Chevy Chase; a slapstick farce starring Bill Murray; and an earnest coming-of-age comedy-drama featuring Michael O\u2019Keefe. But the inconsistency and incongruity somehow mesh, due in part to the picture\u2019s spirit of cheerful, slobs-vs.-snobs anarchy, resulting in something akin to a coked-up Marx Brothers movie.  \u2014  A scene from \u201cCool Runnings.\u201d Buena Vista Pictures  \u2018Cool Runnings\u2019  Leaving Netflix: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  One of the highlights of the 1988 Winter Olympics (from a storytelling perspective, if not a sporting one) was the debut of the Jamaican national bobsled team, which quickly became a fan favorite for their clear discomfort with an event not exactly common to their tropical home. But it soon became a feel-good underdog story of teamwork in the face of adversity \u2014 in other words, ideal fodder for a big-screen dramatization by Disney. And what could have been a one-joke physical comedy play instead became a warmhearted \u201990s classic, thanks to the energetic direction by Jon Turteltaub (\u201cNational Treasure\u201d) and the charismatic turns by Doug E. Doug, Leon, Malik Yoba, and Rawle D. Lewis as the team members, and (in one of his final performances) the great John Candy as their coach.  \u2014  0  John Mulaney on \u201cJohn Mulaney: New in Town.\u201d Comedy Central  \u2018John Mulaney: New in Town\u2019  Leaving Netflix: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  This 2012 special from John Mulaney, the former \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d writer and stand-up comic extraordinaire, which originally aired on Comedy Central, was only his second such showcase, but he already showed an old-timer\u2019s mastery of the form. His deceptively simple persona, of a meek but good-hearted soul doing his very best to navigate a complicated world, proves durable and reliable as he explores dating, doctor\u2019s visits and basic social interactions. The show\u2019s funniest (if somewhat specialized) bit, however, may be his lengthy rumination on the pleasures of \u201cLaw & Order: Special Victims Unit\u201d and its resident skeptic, Ice-T.  \u2014  Alex Bailey/Fox Searchlight Pictures  \u2018Never Let Me Go\u2019  Leaving Netflix: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Kazuo Ishiguro\u2019s 2005 dystopian romance novel gets the big-screen treatment in this 2010 drama from director Mark Romanek (\u201cOne Hour Photo\u201d). Keira Knightley, Carey Mulligan and Andrew Garfield star as three students and occasional romantic partners who discover, in their teens, that all of them are clones \u2014 born and raised for the eventual harvesting of their organs. Screenwriter Alex Garland displays the thoughtful, chamber-music approach to science fiction of his subsequent \u201cEx Machina\u201d and \u201cAnnihilation\u201d (both of which he directed). Romanek, meanwhile, pulls off the neat trick of creating a cold, sterile world that is nonetheless infected by warmth and humanity \u2014 attributable in no small part to the skillful work of his crackerjack cast.  \u2014  Morgan Freeman in \u201cThe Shawshank Redemption.\u201d Columbia Pictures, via Everett Collection  \u2018The Shawshank Redemption\u2019  Leaving Netflix: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Removing this 1994 prison drama from Netflix probably won\u2019t dent its ubiquity \u2014 it\u2019s a regular topper of IMDb\u2019s Top 250 list and it seems to pop up on TNT or TBS on a near-weekly basis. But it still smarts not to have this cinematic comfort food a mouse-click away, as it features the quintessential Morgan Freeman performance (wise, calm, and narrating for clarity) and some of Tim Robbins\u2019 most complicated work (as a man who says little and reveals even less). Frank Darabont\u2019s patient filmmaking, in which a series of seemingly casual vignettes crescendo into an emotionally overwhelming climax, makes this a particularly re-watchable film, in which little throwaways and asides take on extra meaning upon second (and third, and tenth) viewings.  \u2014  David Bowie in \u201cThe Prestige.\u201d Touchstone Pictures  \u2018The Prestige\u2019  Leaving Netflix: April 21  April 21 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Between his first and second cracks at Batman, director Christopher Nolan slid in this twisty, stylish exercise in sleight-of-hand moviemaking, as if to assure the fans of his breakthrough movie \u201cMemento\u201d that he was still up to his old tricks. This time around, the term \u201ctricks\u201d is literal: In \u201cThe Prestige,\u201d Nolan tells the story of two stage magicians in 1890s London, whose friendly rivalry first becomes fraught, then deadly. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale scheme and connive appropriately in the leading roles; a standout supporting cast includes Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall and David Bowie.  \u2014  Banksy in a scene from \u201cExit Through the Gift Shop.\u201d Paranoid Pictures  \u2018Exit Through the Gift Shop\u2019  Leaving Netflix: April 22  April 22 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  The enigmatic and eccentric street artist Banksy directs this Oscar-nominated 2010 documentary, in which he profiles the rise of Thierry Guetta, known by the street-art name \u201cMister Brainwash.\u201d Frisky and funny, it casts a cynical insider\u2019s eye on the art world, as well as on Banksy\u2019s place inside it \u2014 particularly in retrospect because of rumors that Guetta was, in fact, a creation of Banksy\u2019s and that the entire story is a made-up prank. The director (who never reveals his face in the film) has denied the rumors, but they lend an extra dimension to this film, in which everything (and perhaps everyone) could be a bluff.  \u2014  Mark Ruffalo and Keira Knightley in \u201cBegin Again.\u201d Andrew Schwartz/Weinstein Company  \u2018Begin Again\u2019  Leaving Netflix: April 27  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  The Irish writer and director John Carney revisited his microbudget, Oscar-winning indie sensation \u201cOnce\u201d with a well-financed, star-cast exploration of the same themes: the magnificence of pop music, the semi-romantic charge of collaboration and the power of a song to say what can\u2019t be put into words alone. Keira Knightley is charming (and believable) as a songwriter who finds an unexpected champion in a burned-out record executive (Mark Ruffalo). The musical numbers are stirring, and the dramatic beats land, but its best scene is its simplest: its two protagonists, wandering through New York City with their headphones, playing each other their favorite songs. Sweet but not saccharine, it is full of tiny moments of truth.  \u2014", "stock": "NFLX", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-22", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/22/watching/leaving-netflix-movies-april.html"}, {"article": "Photo  The plan to have every episode of the second season of Marvel and Netflix\u2019s \u201cJessica Jones\u201d directed by women was conceived a year before the Harvey Weinstein revelations. But now that season arrives like a presciently timed herald of the #MeToo-Time\u2019s Up revolution, with 13 female directors and 9 of 13 episodes written or co-written by women. For added emphasis, it begins streaming on Thursday, which is International Women\u2019s Day.  This concentration of female creators is unusual, of course, particularly for a high-profile, comic-book-based drama. But \u201cJessica Jones\u201d was already one of the more women-centric dramas around when its first season appeared more than two years ago.  Its creator and showrunner, Melissa Rosenberg of the \u201cTwilight\u201d movies, focused tightly on Jones (Krysten Ritter), a moody private eye who had super strength forced on her as a child, and a few other female characters: Trish Walker (Rachael Taylor), a talk-radio host who is Jones\u2019s only friend, and Jeri Hogarth (Carrie-Anne Moss), a ruthless lawyer who helps Jones when it aligns with her own agenda.  In the first five episodes of Season 2 (an atypically small number for Netflix to provide for review), that triumvirate is even more central to the plot. And their portrayals have taken on new shades. Already isolated \u2014 none has children or a spouse \u2014 they are defined even more than before by their pain and rage and their desperate efforts to assert control over their lives. Jones is an emotional cripple unable to confront her past; Hogarth\u2019s monomaniacal focus on her career leaves her unprepared to face mortality. The relatively well-adjusted Walker is an abuse victim and recovering addict who can\u2019t commit to a relationship.

We\u2019ve seen a powerful person\u2019s downward spiral play out in a room with multiple hookers, cocaine and embarrassing dancing, but that person usually isn\u2019t a woman. We\u2019ve seen protagonists whose bottled-up anger turns them sullen, violent and heedless of others, but they\u2019re usually men. We\u2019ve seen the heroes of mystery-thrillers worry about their investigations putting loved ones in danger, but heroines not so much. (Conversely, traditional roles are preserved in a plot element involving Walker\u2019s past as a child star that explicitly invokes #MeToo.)

But a clich\u00e9 is still a clich\u00e9, whether it\u2019s presented from a female or male point of view. And the early episodes of the season make a lot of room for fairly static character development, with proportionally less attention paid to the traditional genre pleasures, like atmosphere and action, which were central to the first season\u2019s invigorating noir-superhero synthesis. (The noir part of the equation is still present, but dimly, in Jones\u2019s occasional voice-overs and in a preponderance of detective work that\u2019s pretty basic and arbitrary, a step or two above Googling when it isn\u2019t simply Googling.)", "stock": "NFLX", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-07", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/07/arts/television/marvel-jessica-jones-review-netflix.html"}, {"article": "Netflix NFLX 0.78% is glowing. \u201cWe had a beautiful Q4,\u201d the company preened in its letter to shareholders. It isn\u2019t wrong.  The streaming service reported earnings per share of 41 cents, up from 15 cents a year ago, and revenue of $3.29 billion, slightly beating analysts\u2019 estimates of $3.28 billion. Most impressively, it added 8.3 million subscribers globally\u2014the highest in the company\u2019s history\u2014even as it raised its subscription price to $11 a month. That is an 18% year-over-year increase, exceeding the company\u2019s own forecast of 6.3 million subscribers. Shares shot up 9% in after hours trading.  Legacy media, says Rich Greenfield of BTIG Research, should \u201cbe afraid, be very afraid.\u201d With hit content like \u201cStranger Things\u201d and \u201cThe Crown,\u201d Netflix has created a virtuous cycle: Subscribers keep joining at higher price points, allowing the company to spend more on content, which in turn allows them to draw in and retain more subscribers.  Of the over 8 million new subscribers, 6.36 million came from international markets. They have finally made Netflix\u2019s global segments profitable, delivering earnings of $227 million in 2017.  With an eye on competition, the company is accelerating its investments for 2018. It will raise marketing spending to $2 billion and spend $7.5 billion to $8 billion on new content, including 30 international original series in places like Poland, India, and Japan.  \u201cThis is a land grab opportunity,\u201d says Mr. Greenfield. \u201cThey see Disney , Apple , Amazon coming, and they\u2019re trying to extend their lead as far as possible before the competition gets going.\u201d  Netflix is slated to have a long lead indeed. Disney, which hopes to break into international markets with its acquisition of assets from 21st Century Fox , will find that Netflix has already beaten them there. It also plans to launch its own Disney-branded streaming service. Yet this likely won\u2019t happen before late 2019. Meanwhile, Hulu, in which Disney will have a 60% stake after the Fox deal, has added far fewer subscribers than Netflix even though it maintains a lower price.  Hit shows from HBO and Amazon will draw viewers. But content is unique, meaning streaming services can coexist comfortably. As long as Netflix continues producing such popular content, viewers will keep watching, and recently they are watching even more. In 2017, streaming hours per membership grew by 9% year-over-year.  Netflix\u2019s already ugly balance sheet will look even worse next year with negative free cash flow of $3 billion to $4 billion. The company expects to sell more high-yield bonds. None of that has mattered so far to its soaring stock price\u2014its market cap hit $100 billion\u2014or to its bonds.

The company driving the multibillion-dollar bidding drama is happily sitting on the couch: Netflix . NFLX 0.78%  Comcast gate-crashed an already lively party Tuesday by offering \u00a312.50 ($17.50) a share for Sky. That is 12% more than the \u00a310.75 on offer from 21st Century Fox and, by extension, Disney , DIS -0.04% which wants to buy Sky along with other Fox assets.  Including debt, the Comcast offer values Sky at $41 billion, which works out at 13 times expected earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, according to FactSet. Dish Network, traditionally a satellite distributor like Sky, trades on roughly five times Ebitda, after stripping out its spectrum assets, according to Will Milner at research house Arete.  Admittedly, Sky has a much stronger market position than Dish. It was the U.K.\u2019s first pay-TV company, with an offer anchored by Premier League soccer, and it has kept at the forefront of industry innovations like the set-top box and \u201cover-the-top\u201d streaming. As a result, it still serves more than twice as many U.K. households as its closest peer, Liberty Global\u2019s Virgin Media cable network.  This is Sky\u2019s essential appeal to both Comcast and Disney. It has a direct relationship with 23 million customers, not far from Comcast\u2019s 29 million. And they are mainly in markets\u2014the U.K. and Ireland\u2014that are already familiar with the kind of English-language TV content that both Comcast and Disney own and produce. In this Sky has no real peers.  Streaming giant Netflix\u2019s high stock-market valuation shows the appeal to investors of a global \u201cdirect-to-consumer\u201d platform. Something of this high valuation is now rubbing off on Sky as Disney and Comcast are both feeling increasing pressure to roll out something that competes with Netflix.  Both U.S. cable-and-media groups look set to be major beneficiaries of U.S. tax cuts, giving them cash to splurge. And given the antitrust uncertainty surrounding AT&T\u2019s bid for Time Warner, it is easy to see why Comcast has opted to focus on Sky rather than Fox. For regulators, Comcast may be the preferred bidder, with none of the issues about concentration of ownership in British media that have dogged Fox\u2019s bid.  The irony here is that Sky is itself being disrupted by streaming. Its growth has become increasingly dependent on its own over-the-top product, Now TV, which is much cheaper than its old full-service package. Some 2% to 3% of households are trading down from the premium package to Now TV a year. Stripping out mobile-phone contracts, research firm New Street Research estimates that Sky\u2019s U.K. subscription revenue\u2014the bedrock of its business\u2014rose just 0.8% year over year in the most recent quarter. Meanwhile, heavy technology investments have weighed on cash flows.  Sky shares rose to \u00a313.40 in afternoon trading Tuesday, suggesting investors expect a counteroffer from Fox or Disney. But the U.S. media giants should be wary of engaging in a bidding war for what is essentially an incumbent TV provider. Sky could end up part of the problem, not part of the solution.  The cable industry is undergoing a major transformation, as more Americans cut the cord on their cable subscriptions and flock to streaming services like Hulu and Netflix. So how did we get here?

Netflix said Monday it would spend $7.5 billion to $8 billion on content this year. Photo: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg News  Netflix Inc. continued its blistering growth in the fourth quarter, as mounting investments in original shows like \u201cStranger Things\u201d and movies like \u201cBright\u201d helped the streaming service sign up subscribers at a record rate.  The company added 8.3 million streaming users\u2014the most it has ever gained in a quarter\u2014exceeding the 6.3 million net additions it had projected. The growth in the U.S. and internationally brought its total paid subscriber count to 110.6 million at the end of the fourth quarter.  The results showed Netflix can continue to grow its customer ranks despite price increases in the U.S. and rising competition for viewers and programming from rival streaming services. Netflix shares gained 9% after hours, pushing the company\u2019s market capitalization above $100 billion.  In a letter to shareholders, Netflix acknowledged the emergence of more premium video content from technology companies like Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc., ad-supported platforms such as Facebook and Google\u2019s YouTube, and entertainment companies like Walt Disney Co. , which underscored its direct-to-consumer ambitions when it agreed to purchase most of 21st Century Fox for $52.4 billion.  \u201cThe market for entertainment time is vast and can support many successful services,\u201d the company said in the letter. \u201cEntertainment services are often complementary given their unique content offerings.\u201d  The expansion of direct-to-consumer video gave viewers an all-time high of 487 scripted shows across streaming and traditional TV in 2017, according to research from FX Networks.  Los Gatos, Calif.-based Netflix has been spending heavily on original programs to attract new subscribers. Netflix said Monday it would spend $7.5 billion to $8 billion on content this year, up from a forecast of $7 billion to $8 billion previously, far outstripping investments from rivals including Hulu, Amazon and HBO.  And Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings said on the company\u2019s earnings call that content costs will continue to rise in 2019 and 2020.  Netflix said it now has $17.7 billion in streaming-content obligations, a measure of current and future costs for content acquisition, licensing and production.  In a rare move, the company took a $39 million noncash charge in the fourth quarter on content it decided not to release, which Chief Financial Officer David Wells said was \u201crelated to the societal reset around sexual harassment.\u201d Last year, Netflix cut ties with actor Kevin Spacey after he was accused of sexual harassment, and the streaming service said it would bring the hit drama \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d back for one final season without Mr. Spacey.  Netflix also said it would boost its spending on technology and increase its marketing budget to $2 billion this year from $1.3 billion.

So how did we get here? Illustration: Shaumbe Wright/WSJ  The increased spending comes with a trade-off, as Netflix blew through $2 billion more in cash than it brought in last year, and this year the company projects negative free cash flow of $3 billion to $4 billion. But the company said Monday that rising operating profits and slowing growth in original content spending will eventually lead to positive free cash flow.  \u201cThey are spending more on content and burning more cash,\u201d Anthony DiClemente, internet analyst at Evercore ISI, said. \u201cHowever, as long as the revenue growth is accelerating and the net subscriber additions continue, investors will look past the spending.\u201d  Netflix shares set a record closing price on Monday at $227.58, about 227 times earnings.  The company added 6.36 million foreign subscribers in the quarter, compared with its forecast of 5.05 million. It added 1.98 million U.S. subscribers, compared with its outlook for 1.25 million.  Netflix expects the growth to continue in the current quarter, projecting net additions of 1.45 million U.S. subscribers and 4.9 million international customers.  Netflix has increased its international investments in recent years. More than half of its total subscribers are from countries outside the U.S. and it plans over 30 international-focused original series this year, including in France, Poland, India and Korea. Monday, the company said the international segment contributed positively to the company\u2019s full-year profit for the first time.  Netflix said revenue increased 33% to $3.29 billion in its fourth quarter, above analysts\u2019 estimates.  Net income came in at $185.5 million, or 41 cents a share, compared with $66.7 million, or 15 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter.

He and his cast sampled the Mexican staple everywhere from the Yucat\u00e1n to Copenhagen.  One of his favorite tacos came from a food truck in L.A. It featured ingredients usually associated with the Middle East\u2014shawarma (meat sliced from a turning spit) and a thick, pitalike flour tortilla. In the show, he traced the history of these \u201cArab tacos\u201d back to the city of Puebla, about 80 miles southeast of Mexico City. There, Mr. Chang learned, immigrants from the Middle East helped to create the tacos decades ago.  He came across plenty of other cross-cultural connections in exploring other iconic dishes for the show. In Houston, he tasted Viet-Cajun crawfish, a combination of a New Orleans Creole dish with Vietnamese seasoning. In Italy, he noted how much tortellini look like wontons. \u201cEvery type of food came from somewhere else,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that just sprouted from someone\u2019s head.\u201d  Mr. Chang, 40, is best known for founding the Momofuku Group, with over a dozen Asian-inspired restaurants around the world, as well as six locations of the fast-casual chain Fuku and 13 Milk Bar dessert stores. He\u2019s still expanding his restaurant empire, which offers indulgent, sometimes oddball dishes such as kimchi bacon burgers and his much-imitated barbecued pork-belly buns. The chef and his restaurants have won five James Beard Awards, and one of the New York locations, Momofuku Ko, has carried two Michelin stars since 2009.  \u201cI think Momofuku has always tried to be a merger of things that don\u2019t always go together,\u201d Mr. Chang says. As for his show, \u201cwhen you say the word \u2018ugly delicious\u2019 it made sense.\u201d Many of his favorite dishes, such as curries and noodles, look ugly, he says.  The show\u2019s eight thematic episodes range from fried chicken to pizza to barbecue. The series asks why some cultures and not others readily assimilate new foods and dishes from afar. An area\u2019s tradition and its immigration history are major factors, Mr. Chang discovered. New Orleans, he found, was hesitant to accept new flavors and experimentation, in part thanks to a proud Creole culinary past. Houston, on the other hand, embraced waves of immigrants and their cooking techniques.  Mr. Chang now appreciates his own culture more, he says, partly because he \u2018ran away from it to begin with.\u2019 Photo: Austin Hargrave for The Wall Street Journal  For Mr. Chang, such stories have a strong personal resonance. The son of Korean immigrants, he grew up outside of Washington, D.C., in suburban Virginia. His mother made fried rice and chicken soup and his grandmother would make Korean dumplings, he remembers. His father used to take him to local pho and ramen spots, where Mr. Chang would watch in wonder as the chefs worked the dough and pulled it into long strands. \u201cThat\u2019s how my dad expressed love to me, by going out to eat,\u201d he says.  His parents were in the restaurant business for a time, but their two establishments served American fare\u2014 salads, soups and steaks. Mr. Chang never thought he would grow up to be a chef. \u201cI knew restaurants were in my dad\u2019s blood,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand until later that it could be a profession.\u201d  Mr. Chang was a champion golfer in high school, and his father wanted him to try being a professional, but he didn\u2019t enjoy the sport. Unsure of a career, he spent two years after college teaching English in Japan, where he fell in love with the local ramen shops. He kept copious notes of what he saw there, right down to the flavorings in the first slurp of soup.  When he returned to the U.S., he took a desk job in finance\u2014and hated it. He quit after six months and enrolled at the French Culinary Institute (now the International Culinary Center) in New York, with stints afterward at high-end restaurants in the city such as Craft and Caf\u00e9 Boulud.  When he finally decided to strike out on his own, it was to embrace the Asian food of his childhood: \u201cI think part of it is accepting being me.\u201d He now appreciates his own culture more, he says, partly because he \u201cran away from it to begin with.\u201d  In 2004, Mr. Chang started Momofuku Noodle Bar as a casual ramen spot. In six months, once he adjusted the menu to his liking, lines started forming out the door. His restaurant empire has expanded relentlessly since then.  Critics heaped praise on Mr. Chang\u2019s early restaurants but have not been as enthusiastic about one recent venture. A 2016 review of his new Italian-inflected restaurant by New York Times food critic Pete Wells was headlined: \u201cDavid Chang\u2019s Magic Shows a Little Wear.\u201d  Mr. Chang responded to the review in a New Yorker profile of Mr. Wells, saying, \u201cHe\u2019s being a [expletive] bully.\u201d These days, Mr. Chang thinks that customer reviews on services such as Yelp carry just as much weight as the opinions of professional critics.  Mr. Chang has experienced some failures as his business has expanded. Last year, he attempted to launch his own meal-preparation and delivery service, and a few years before that he invested in another. Both have since closed. Mr. Chang has said that delivery services were difficult to get right.  But the chef is still creating new concepts for restaurants and figuring out where to start them. Majordomo, which opened earlier this year in L.A., offers creative takes on basics and recently included short ribs with beef rice and shiso rice paper, and macaroni and chickpeas with black pepper.  Mr. Chang remains committed to experimenting and expanding. \u201cIt\u2019s this giant thing, and I don\u2019t know how it grows, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s going to grow.\u201d But he worries, too: \u201cEvery day feels like it\u2019s all going to end simultaneously.\u201d  Write to Alexandra Wolfe at alexandra.wolfe@wsj.com", "stock": "NFLX", "label": 1, "date": "2018-04-07", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/david-changs-culinary-mash-ups-1523030104"}, {"article": "Matters that seem arcane are often vitally important, because they can be worth tens of billions of dollars. Such is the case with \u201crisk adjustment\u201d in health care. Medical spending is not spread evenly across all people in society. Half the population uses hardly any care in a given year\u2014only 3% of total spending. Conversely, 10% of Americans consume about two-thirds of all health-care spending.  Consequently, when someone buys an ObamaCare plan or enrolls in a Medicare Advantage managed-care plan, the federal government needs to adjust the fixed premium (or subsidy) it pays to account for how sick the person is. Patients who have serious conditions come with bigger government payments. Without this adjustment, insurers and health-care providers would have a strong incentive to care only for healthy people.  Photo: istock/getty images  While the concept sounds simple, risk adjustment is among the factors that make health care so maddeningly complicated. For an \u201caverage patient\u201d in Erie County, N.Y., the government will pay a private insurer offering a Medicare Advantage plan roughly $9,500 a year. But for a patient with lung cancer, diabetes with complications, depression and macular degeneration, risk adjustment triples the amount to just over $27,000 a year.  That large difference is intended to ensure that the sick patient can continue to get care. But consider the incentives it sets up. As every physician knows, many diseases are diagnosed and their severity assessed based on clinical judgment as opposed to objective criteria. Others may be under control or no longer relevant and aptly characterized as \u201cpast medical history.\u201d Finally, many conditions emerge in almost everyone with age.  Risk adjustment gives doctors and Medicare Advantage insurers a financial reason to ignore these nuances. Instead they have incentives to find every possible diagnosis\u2014and then to make the patient\u2019s conditions sound as severe as possible\u2014so as to raise government payments the most.  This gaming is pervasive enough to have a name: up-coding. In 2016 the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services audited 37 Medicare Advantage health plans. Thirty-five had overcharged the government, commonly by overstating the severity of diabetes and depression. A 2016 study from the Government Accountability Office suggests this practice costs taxpayers billions of dollars a year in overpayments.  Because Medicare cannot police every plan, it has attacked the problem with a sledgehammer, enacting an annual \u201ccoding intensity adjustment,\u201d which in 2018 will reduce premiums by \u201cat least 5.91%.\u201d But this adjustment, which insurers aggressively lobby to minimize, penalizes honest Medicare Advantage plans, too. Ultimately, it does not solve the problem because insurers build the \u201cpenalty\u201d into their premiums.  Up-coding also diverts providers and insurers from finding ways to improve care and reduce costs. This effect is reinforced by the Affordable Care Act\u2019s \u201cmedical loss ratio\u201d rules, which require insurers to spend at least 85% of premiums on clinical care. The only way to increase profits, then, is to raise revenues while keeping administrative costs the same. Gaming risk adjustment is an easy way to do that.  Doctors find risk adjustment incredibly frustrating. Medicare Advantage plans torment them with reminders to do annual visits, in the guise of \u201cwellness visits,\u201d to code every disease in every patient. A whole industry of opportunistic intermediaries like Inovalon, hired by health-insurance companies, support up-coding by retrieving patient charts, mining them for abnormal lab values or prescriptions indicative of diseases that aren\u2019t being billed, and then faxing back \u201csuggestions\u201d for added diagnoses. This distracts doctors, provides no value for patients, and sucks tons of money out of the system.  How to clean up this mess? Begin by acknowledging that current methods of risk adjustment are not very good. On average, the factors used by Medicare today\u2014mainly data from past claims\u2014can account for only about 36% of the true variation in patient spending due to disease. That means lots of extra money is flowing for diagnoses that do not necessarily imply the assumed increased costs.  One way for Medicare to do better would be to emulate Netflix . Beginning in 2006, Netflix ran a world-wide contest to improve Cinematch, its proprietary algorithm for predicting how users would rate films they\u2019d never seen. The grand prize was $1 million. Within a year, over 2,000 separate teams from 150 countries had submitted more than 13,000 algorithms. Eventually, the winning team, which included researchers from AT&T Labs, Yahoo and an Austrian consulting firm, improved the algorithm by more than 10%. For a tiny cost, Netflix got a huge amount of computer-science research that even its highly skilled employees could not perform.  Medicare should do the same: create a contest open to anyone in the world who can beat its current risk-adjustment model. To ensure fairness and encourage competition, administering it should be outsourced to the X Prize Foundation or a similar group. The winner should be able to use objective patient data to account for at least 45% of the spending variation caused by disease. Medicare could award a $10 million grand prize and several million for second and third place. It also should be required to adopt one of the top methods. (There may be practical reasons not to pick the winner.)  To prevent insurers from figuring out how to game this updated risk-adjustment model, Medicare should run a new contest every five to seven years. Tens of millions in prize money could save taxpayers tens of billions a year in up-coding gimmicks.

The streaming video giant\u2019s stock is down 4.9% in the first two days of the week to about $316, a rare pullback for shares that have more than doubled over the last 12 months and climbed 22% in the last month alone. The gains have outshone many of Netflix\u2019s high-flying tech-focused peers.  The recent drop followed remarks by short-seller Andrew Left of Citron Research, who said in a tweet Monday that shares, \u201ccan be shorted back to $300,\u201d after the company\u2019s market cap surged in the preceding week.  \u201cI think the market has become over-enthused by the product and not realistic about the economics,\u201d he said in an interview. Mr. Left, who is known for shorting such companies as Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc., said he is currently betting against the stock.  Netflix shares have a long history of momentum-driven growth that\u2019s drawn passionate arguments from both bulls and bears. The company has posted consistently strong subscriber growth and invested heavily in its original content. It\u2019s also been burning through cash and borrowing heavily. It faces a slew of upstart rivals, from Amazon.com Inc. to Walt Disney Co.  Scott Devitt, an analyst at Stifel, recently dropped his rating on the company to \u201chold,\u201d from \u201cbuy.\u201d In a report to clients last week, he wrote that the \u201cshare price may have sprinted ahead of fundamentals in the short-term.\u201d  The company\u2019s chief executive, Reed Hastings, has counted himself among the stock price skeptics in the past. In the summer of 2015, when the stock was at about $100, Mr. Hastings said in response to a question about whether the stock is overpriced: \u201cwhen the stock was half this price, I described it as euphoric. So it\u2019s a mystery to me.\u201d  Still, the recent surge has its benefits, the company has said. In a recent quarterly letter, the company noted that a thick \u201cequity cushion\u201d has been good for its borrowing in the junk bond market. The company has about $6.5 billion in total debt, according to FactSet, and its bond prices have held up relatively well recently. A spokesman for the firm declined to comment.  The Netflix critics have had a tough run recently. The stock had an average short position worth $5.5 billion so far this year, which has sustained paper losses of nearly $3 billion in 2018 through the end of last week, according to financial analytics firm S3 Partners. So far this week, they\u2019ve made back about $319 million.  Short sellers bet against a stock by borrowing from a lender and selling it, hoping to buy it back at a lower price when they return it later on. They pocket the difference if the stock has fallen, but can expose themselves to sharp losses if it rises, as Netflix has done.  The number of shorted shares has fallen recently as investors pared their positions. Many have bumped up against limits on how much risk they can take as the stock price has risen, according to Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3. Short interest as a share of float hit an all-time low of just under 5% last month, as fewer shares were shorted and the number of outstanding shares increased.  \u2013 Ken Jimenez and Sam Goldfarb contributed to this article", "stock": "NFLX", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-13", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2018/03/13/netflixs-massive-rally-draws-attention-of-skeptics/"}, {"article": "The biggest antitrust trial since U.S. v.

Would you like a pilot or just go straight to an order of six episodes?\u201d  Since \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d took off in 2013, Netflix has run amok, releasing an estimated 126 original series and films in 2016, and maybe 200 last year. That\u2019s something on the order of 1,000 hours, or 40 full days, of binge watching. Some of these efforts are great, some are good, and most are just filler, like \u201c Bill Nye Saves the World.\u201d But so what? The point is they are distributed on the internet, via cable modems or mobile phones. AT&T and Time Warner have little influence, and nobody\u2014from ABC to HBO\u2014has a lock on entertainment these days.  Netflix has 55 million American subscribers and, gulp, raised its prices in November. Netflix doesn\u2019t license its shows to anyone else in the U.S.! Should the government break it up? By the way, that \u201cSouth Park\u201d episode is available on Viacom \u2019s Comedy Central, though Hulu\u2019s 17 million subscribers can also watch it online.  Amazon Prime has something like 80 million subscribers in the U.S., and 26 million of them watch the company\u2019s original content. Google\u2019s YouTube is now offering streaming TV, basically a $40-a-month substitute for cable. Similarly, Hulu has Live TV and Sony has PlayStation Vue. All March Madness games can be streamed online. Consumers have choices.  And we\u2019re just getting started. Worried about cord-cutting, Disney has paid $2.5 billion for a 75% stake in BAMTech, Major League Baseball\u2019s streaming company. RBC analyst Steven Cahall suggests Disney could spend $15 billion a year on streaming shows. That partially explains why Mickey Mouse is chasing 21st Century Fox .  Or look at the raw figures. Programming is a $90-billion-a-year business. Both Fox and Time Warner spend around $8 billion on nonsports content. Netflix spent $6 billion last year and hopes to hit $8 billion in 2018. Amazon spends $5 billion. Where is the market dominance?  Apple has sold more than a billion iPhones and is spending $1 billion this year getting its feet wet with original programming. The company recently put up millions for two seasons of a show about, ugh, a TV morning show, produced and starring Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston. If anything, extreme competition has shifted the balance of power to actors\u2014or, as some in Silicon Valley call them, meat puppets.  The AT&T antitrust case smells quite similar to the arguments for net neutrality, which also ignore real competition and emerging technologies. The feds are chasing ghosts. As they should be well aware, vertically structured companies tend to fall ill or die from natural causes\u2014see General Motors , IBM and, well, AT&T. No one pays 25 cents a minute for long-distance calls anymore.  Still, I\u2019m not sure why AT&T needs to get in bed with Hollywood, which year after year degrades the meaning of \u201cBest Picture.\u201d AT&T should instead return to a focus on technical excellence. I\u2019d rather that it run fiber on every highway and byway in America than peddle mediocre sitcoms.", "stock": "NFLX", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-18", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-ts-south-park-argument-1521397501"}, {"article": "Here are some of the companies with shares expected to trade actively in Tuesday\u2019s session.

VZ -0.17% and Comcast Corp. CMCSA -0.33% are in tight competition for least-inspiring telecom company.  Cable network subscribers have gone from single-digit growth, to flat and now to declining. For Verizon and Comcast, both of which reported fourth-quarter earnings this week, those losses are getting worse as subscribers opt for streaming services like Netflix.  Verizon lost 29,000 Fios video customers this quarter, up from 18,000 in the third quarter and 15,000 in the second. Comcast similarly reported a loss of 33,000 video customers, an increase from 22,390 last quarter.  The erosion is unlikely to slow soon. \u201cWe don\u2019t expect the level of competition to diminish,\u201d Comcast said of the video sector.  \u201cWhy watch live TV?\u201d says Rich Greenfield of BTIG Research. \u201cThe amount of content on demand has gotten really good, really fast. And cable networks are competing not just against new shows, but against every great show ever made.\u201d  Verizon offset these losses as more customers signed up for wireless plans and high-speed internet. It narrowly missed analysts\u2019 expectations, reporting 86 cents per share, rather than 88 cents, and revenue of $33.96 billion. Savings from tax cuts will give it $3.5 billion to $4 billion in extra cash, boosting full-year earnings. Shares are up 1% since it announced results on Tuesday.  Comcast\u2019s results were stronger, reporting 49 cents per share above the 47-cent estimates, and revenue of $21.92 billion. It will use its tax windfall to increase its dividend by 21% and buy back $5 billion in stock this year. Investors are likely disappointed that the company wasn\u2019t more aggressive in its share buybacks. Shares were flat after the announcement on Wednesday.  \u201cIt\u2019s impolitic to buy back too much at once. Trump has said he doesn\u2019t want that to happen,\u201d said Craig Moffett, a media analyst at MoffettNathanson.  The buyback also leaves little room for acquisitions. Despite a deal-making rush in the industry, Verizon similarly insisted that it will not seek a merger.  Neither company looks compelling for the foreseeable future. But with strong growth in its NBCUniversal business and the Super Bowl and Winter Olympics expected to bring in $1.4 billion in ad revenue, Comcast remains slightly less uninspiring.  The cable industry is undergoing a major transformation, as more Americans cut the cord on their cable subscriptions and flock to streaming services like Hulu and Netflix. So how did we get here?

Image: Netflix/Beta Films  The roaring 1920s are given a German twist in \u201cBabylon Berlin,\u201d a lavish television series that chronicles the social turmoil leading up to the Third Reich.  It premiered last October in Germany and became one of the country\u2019s most-watched shows, just behind the seventh season of \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d On Tuesday it begins streaming in the U.S. via Netflix , with subtitles. The show\u2019s depiction of crime, corruption and political unrest led German newspaper Die Zeit to note its \u201calmost eerie parallels to the present.\u201d  \u201cAt the time people did not realize how absolutely unstable this new construction of society which the Weimar Republic represented was,\u201d says series co-director Tom Tykwer. \u201cIt interested us because the fragility of democracy has been put to the test quite profoundly in recent years.\u201d  Hitler\u2019s name is only mentioned once during the German-language show\u2019s first season, and then only when he is referred to as a joke candidate. In the German federal election of 1928, Nazis won a mere 2.6% of the vote. Five years later, they took 44%.  Tom Tykwer previously directed \u2018Run Lola Run\u2019 and other films before tackling \u2018Babylon Berlin.\u2019 Photo: Axel Schmidt/REUTERS  Based on novels by the German crime writer Volker Kutscher, \u201cBabylon Berlin\u201d cost about $40 million, making it one of the most expensive German TV series ever made, according to a spokeswoman for Beta Film, which sold the series in 60 countries. It is also the first German co-production between a public broadcaster, ARD, and a private one, Sky, she said.  Co-written and co-directed by Mr. Tykwer and fellow German filmmakers Henk Handloegten and Achim von Borries, the show required 180 days of shooting, nearly 300 locations, 5,000 extras and features a jazzy soundtrack from Bryan Ferry. It stars 37-year-old Volker Bruch \u2014one of the leads in the Emmy-winning \u201cGeneration War\u201d\u2014as Gereon Rath, a haunted, self-medicating police commissioner from Cologne who is transferred to the vice squad in Berlin, a city he knows little about.  \u201cFrom the first day the city swallows him up in a big breath,\u201d says producer Stefan Arndt, who helped develop the show. \u201cCologne is old-fashioned, while in Berlin there\u2019s sex, drugs and women with short hair.\u201d  One of these women is Charlotte Ritter (Liv Lisa Fries) who supports her impoverished family by working as an archivist for the police by day and a prostitute by night. Her dream is to become the first woman to be employed as a detective in the all-male Berlin police force.  Liv Lisa Fries plays Charlotte Ritter in \u2018Babylon Berlin.\u2019 Photo: X Filme Creative Pool  \u201cBy 1929, new opportunities were arising,\u201d says Mr. Tykwer, whose fast-paced direction is reminiscent of his 1998 breakout film \u201cRun Lola Run.\u201d \u201cWomen had more possibilities to take part in society, especially in the labor market as Berlin became crowded with new thinking, new art, theater, music and journalistic writing.\u201d  Nonetheless Mr. Tykwer says that he and his co-directors were determined not to idealize those days. \u201cPeople tend to forget that it was also a very rough era in German history,\u201d the 52-year-old director says. \u201cThere was a lot of poverty, and people who had survived the war were suffering from a great deal of trauma.\u201d  Mr. Rath\u2019s first case when he arrives in Berlin is to bust a pornography ring whose members have been covertly filming prominent public figures having sex with prostitutes. The show also examines police brutality toward communists in the Weimar Republic and the stealthy, post-World War I buildup of a secret army that is far greater than the one permitted by the Treaty of Versailles.  \u201cFrom an historical perspective the series is very acute in showing how Weimar democracy was under attack both from the communist left, as well as by traditional conservatives, in a kind of unholy alliance,\u201d says Thomas Weber, a German historian not involved with the show but whose 2010 book \u201cHitler\u2019s First War\u201d is in development as a TV series.  By the end of season two of \u201cBabylon Berlin,\u201d which has already aired in Germany, the Nazi Party is beginning to make its xenophobic presence felt, as citizens grow disillusioned with the Weimar Republic\u2014a period Mr. Weber sees as mirrored in Germany today with the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany party.  The AfD has rejected any comparison with the Nazi party. But it is robustly anti-immigration and some of its leaders have called for a reassessment of 20th-century German history.  On Netflix, the two eight-episode seasons of \u201cBabylon Berlin\u201d are joining other foreign-language shows available to U.S. subscribers, including France\u2019s \u201cThe Frozen Dead,\u201d South Korea\u2019s \u201cBlack\u201d and Spain\u2019s \u201cLa Casa de Papel.\u201d  Mr. Handloegten says that the show\u2019s third season, currently being written, will encompass the 1929 stock market crash, which was devastating to Germany\u2019s working class.  \u201cOne of the main reasons to make \u2018Babylon Berlin\u2019 was to show how all these Nazis did not just fall from the sky,\u201d he says. \u201cThey were human beings who reacted to German society\u2019s changes and made their decisions accordingly.\u201d  Write to Tobias Grey at wsje.weekend@wsj.com", "stock": "NFLX", "label": 1, "date": "2018-01-27", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-hit-drama-in-germany-babylon-berlin-crosses-the-atlantic-1517054137"}, {"article": "(Reuters) - Chipmaker Nvidia Corp said on Tuesday it has suspended self-driving tests across the globe, a week after an Uber Technologies Inc autonomous vehicle struck and killed a woman crossing a street in Arizona.

The Nvidia DRIVE platform is used by over 370 companies developing self-driving technology, including automakers and robotaxi companies and makers of self-driving hardware, such as sensors, Huang said on Tuesday.  Analyst Kinngai Chan from Summit Insight Group said he does not expect the suspension to hurt Nvidia\u2019s earnings.  The question is whether it would be one or two years before fully autonomous vehicles are ready, Chan said, adding if it is pushed out further then the multiple for stock needs to come down as the valuation is very high.

In the past, AMD and Nvidia tried to tame expectations about potential revenue growth from cryptocurrency, but analysts see the floodgates opening for blockchain.  \u201cWe see the bigger category of blockchain as a sustainable market for GPUs and eventually an application specific chip (ASIC) for blockchain applications,\u201d Stifel analyst Kevin Cassidy said.  \u201cWe see a potential for both AMD and Nvidia to benefit from at least supplying the intellectual property for the ASIC.\u201d  Though blockchain is best known as the system underpinning bitcoin, it is increasingly being used by industries to increase security or create efficiencies in business, such as the move by De Beers to use the technology to verify the authenticity of diamonds.  \u201cWhile some will argue upside from crypto should be discounted, we see blockchain as more sustainable than most,\u201d Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer said.  Pitzer estimated that AMD sold about $320 million in chips to blockchain companies in 2017, but it was a fraction of AMD\u2019s full-year revenue of over $5 billion.

Reuters earlier on Tuesday reported about the test suspension, citing a source.  \"Nvidia has no choice but to take steps in the context of the fear, uncertainty and outrage likely to be stimulated by a robot car killing a human being,\" Roger Lanctot, an automotive technology analyst with Strategy Analytics, wrote in a blog post bit.ly/2GaIBCN on Tuesday.  The Nvidia DRIVE platform is used by over 370 companies developing self-driving technology, including automakers and robotaxi companies and makers of self-driving hardware, such as sensors, Huang said on Tuesday.  Analyst Kinngai Chan from Summit Insight Group said he does not expect the suspension to hurt Nvidia\u2019s earnings.  The question is whether it would be one or two years before fully autonomous vehicles are ready, Chan said, adding if it is pushed out further then the multiple for stock needs to come down as the valuation is very high.  Nvidia trades at 37.60 times forward 12-month earnings, compared with 18.92 for its peer group.

(Reuters) - Nvidia Corp unveiled on Tuesday a simulator that leverages cloud computing power to test autonomous vehicles, the latest move involving driverless cars that has helped more than double the chipmaker\u2019s stock in the past 12 months.  Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, speaks at the 2018 Nvidia GPU conference in San Jose, California, U.S. March 27, 2018. REUTERS/Alexandria Sage  The Silicon Valley firm is ubiquitous in the budding self-driving technology sector, with ongoing partnerships with automakers, technology companies and auto suppliers, including Tesla Inc, Uber Technologies Inc, China\u2019s Baidu Inc and Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE).  Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said at the company\u2019s annual GPU Conference in San Jose that the cloud-based system, Nvidia DRIVE Constellation, was based on two different servers, with no need for a physical car. One server simulates the vehicle\u2019s many sensors, and the other runs the vehicle\u2019s software to process the simulated data.  FILE PHOTO - The logo of technology company Nvidia is seen at its headquarters in Santa Clara, California February 11, 2015. REUTERS/Robert Galbraith  Nvidia has said that using simulation, some 300,000 miles (483,000 km) can be driven in five hours, essentially every paved road in the United States simulated in just two days.  The technology is designed to allow automakers and others to validate their technology on billions of driving miles and increase the strength of their algorithms by repeatedly testing difficult scenarios, which would be impractical in the real world.  The software can simulate glare at sunset, snowstorms, poor road surfaces and dangerous situations to test the vehicle\u2019s ability to react.  Questions over the safety of self-driving cars are swirling in the wake of a fatality involving an Uber self-driving vehicle in Arizona.  Companies generally supplement their real-world driving by simulations, which allow them to cover more miles and so-called tricky \u201cedge cases\u201d more efficiently and more cheaply.  The Nvidia DRIVE platform is now used by over 370 companies developing self-driving technology, including automakers and robotaxi companies and those making self-driving hardware, such as sensors, said Huang.

REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo  The company, which also reported better-than-expected quarterly results, is reaping the benefits from the launch of its Volta chip architecture last year. Volta processors power a range of technologies such as artificial intelligence and driverless cars.  \u201cVirtually every internet and cloud service provider has embraced our Volta GPUs,\u201d Nvidia\u2019s Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said in a statement.  Graphic chips were initially developed to handle graphics for high end video games and other computers. These chips help share the processing load from the main chip, making it easier and faster to run high end applications.  These chips are now being widely use in new technologies, like artificial intelligence, machine learning.  Revenue from Nvidia\u2019s widely watched data center business, which counts Microsoft Corp\u2019s (MSFT.O) Azure cloud business as its customer, more than doubled to $606 million.  That trounced analysts\u2019 average estimate of $541.1 million.  Nvidia also sells chips to Amazon.com Inc\u2019s (AMZN.O) Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is dueling with Microsoft to handle data and computing for large enterprises  Data center should continue to grow pretty nicely into calendar 2018 and beyond, Morningstar analyst Abhinav Davuluri said.  The boom in cryptocurrencies is also powering demand for chips from Nvidia and rival AMD (AMD.O) as they provide the high computing ability required for cryptocurrency \u201cmining.\u201d  \u201cStrong demand in the cryptocurrency market exceeded our expectations,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said on a conference call.  \u201cWhile the overall contribution of cryptocurrency to our business remains difficult to quantify, we believe it was a higher percentage of revenue than the prior quarter.\u201d  The company said inventory levels of its gaming GPUs throughout the quarter was lower than historical channel inventory levels due to surging demand from cryptocurrency miners.  The price of Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, rose more than 1,300 percent in 2017. Prices have, however, dropped about 40 percent this year.  Nvidia\u2019s revenue from gaming, for which it is best known, rose 29 percent to $1.74 billion, accounting for a more than half of its total revenue in the fourth quarter, and also beating analysts\u2019 estimate of $1.59 billion.  The company forecast current-quarter revenue of $2.90 billion, plus or minus 2 percent, well above the analysts\u2019 average estimate of $2.47 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Net income rose to $1.12 billion, or $1.78 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Jan. 28 from $655 million, or 99 cents per share, a year earlier.  Results include a $133 million gain related to the new U.S. tax law.  Total revenue rose 34 percent to $2.91 billion, topping estimate of $2.69 billion.  Excluding items, the company said it earned $1.72 per share.  Nvidia earned $1.57 per share, excluding the tax benefit, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, beating estimate of $1.17.

The company\u2019s share price rose 6 percent in early trading on Friday after at least 14 Wall Street brokerages raised their price targets on the stock - a measure of the confidence around the stock among sector analysts.  Gamers use GPUs to play high-quality video games, but Nvidia\u2019s high-performing cards are also now used by those building machines to solve the complex math puzzles used to validate transactions and earn more of cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and bitcoin.  The company\u2019s Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said on a conference call on Thursday that inventory levels for gaming GPUs were at historically low levels due to cryptocurrency miners.  \u201cWe do think that cryptocurrency has been a very significant factor in both revenue and pricing, creating a shortage environment that is boosting pricing,\u201d Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore said in a note after the results.  Analysts also say Nvidia\u2019s competitive advantage is only likely to increase when it moves its Volta chip architecture, launched last year and only currently present in data-center GPUs, into gaming chips later this year.  The new GPU gaming chip, code named Turing, is expected to be unveiled next month. Even without it, Nvidia\u2019s revenue from gaming rose 29 percent to $1.74 billion in the fourth quarter, accounting for more than half of its total revenue.  The company\u2019s quarterly data center revenue - powered by the Volta-based data center GPU, Tesla V100 - more than doubled to $606 million as companies such as Alibaba (BABA.N), Amazon (AMZN.O), Alphabet (GOOGL.O), IBM (IBM.N) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) adopted the new chip in their servers.  Data centers outperformed despite high expectations and Barclays analyst Blayne Curtis said they should do so again given that Volta is in the early stages of adoption.

Facebook Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Netflix Inc. and Google\u2019s parent Alphabet Inc. slumped at least 3.8 percent.  Many of the big names in the industry had their own reasons for bad days: Twitter being targeted by short sellers, Facebook\u2019s ongoing privacy scandal and Nvidia Corp.\u2019s suspension of driving vehicle testing, for starters. Not to mention growing doubts over Tesla Inc.\u2019s new models and a second probe into a car crash.  But for skeptics such as Jeff Gundlach and Howard Marks, the plunge is long overdue. The FANG index\u2019s advance from early 2016 through this month\u2019s peak reached an annualized rate of 67 percent, outpacing even the Nasdaq Composite Index\u2019s return in the final two years of the dot-com bubble.  \u201cIt\u2019s been such a good performer that at this point it\u2019s kind of on the defensive,\u201d Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Co., said by phone. \u201cThere\u2019s so many people with so many gains in technology.\u201d  There is also a valuation case to be made for the intensified selling.

The computer-chip maker Nvidia Corp. didn't fumble an earnings forecast, but its stock tumbled this week, too. Facebook Inc.'s financial power hasn't weakened (so far), yet it has shed a Morgan Stanley worth of market value in two weeks.  Right now, investors worry technology companies might succumb not to competition or business missteps, but to consequences of their own hubris or market power. It all feels overdue, but also odd. We've been writing for so long about the looming technology reckoning that it's surprising to realize investors finally care.  Amazon's stock price fell 4.4 percent on Wednesday after Axios reported that President Donald Trump is \"obsessed\" with the e-commerce titan and imagines ways to curtail its power. In a tweet on Thursday, Trump confirmed that he's concerned about Amazon's impact on cities and states, the U.S. Postal Service and smaller retailers. In response, Amazon shares are falling in early trading.  Facebook has dropped since revelations that a political consulting firm took advantage of the company's formerly lax data rules. Nvidia shares are down almost 10 percent this week after the company said it would suspend tests of driverless cars on public roads in response to an Uber autonomous car hitting and killing a pedestrian. (Nvidia provides technology for Uber's autonomous cars.)  Feeling the Pain A half dozen prominent U.S. tech companies have lost more than $80 billion of combined stock market value this week Source: Bloomberg  These companies aren't all faultless victims. Amazon is not a cuddly charity. Years of Facebook's cavalier attitude about data privacy and the downsides of its social network have created this crisis. Right now, though, investors are realizing that tech companies are so big, pervasive and economically important that suspicion is a permanent fact of life now, and backlash has become a real cost of doing business.  I was both surprised, and not, at Amazon's stock reaction. The U.S. president's antipathy for Amazon or CEO Jeff Bezos is no secret. Last summer, Trump tweeted a not-quite-accurate criticism about Amazon's tax payments. He also said previously that Amazon had a \"huge antitrust problem,\" and tweeted that the company is hurting U.S. cities and states. In December and again in Thursday's tweet, Trump said the U.S. Postal Service's finances were hurt by its business with Amazon. (That one is more complicated than 280 characters can convey). It's tough to know whether Trump truly believes Amazon is causing harm, or whether he harbors a grudge against the Bezos-owned Washington Post. Maybe both.  Trump isn't alone in questioning Amazon's power, but there's not an easy legal weapon to wield. Axios said Trump has \"talked about changing Amazon's tax treatment,\" but it's not clear how tax changes could specifically target Amazon. The company is well-regarded by consumers. Amazon is a bogeyman of many industries, but it only captures perhaps a few percentage points of total U.S. retail spending. Conventional approaches to antitrust law don't apply easily to Amazon, although some academics have said the applications of the law need to change. And needless to say, the White House doesn't directly control U.S. antitrust authorities.  Losing Their Bite An index of 10 large global technology companies, including Facebook and Apple, has dipped 14 percent from a mid-March peak Source: Bloomberg  Assuming Trump's tweet barrage against Amazon doesn't continue, the company's stock decline is likely to be short-lived. But investors' temporary panic is understandable. It's far better for powerful tech companies like Amazon to fly under the radar right now. Apple and Amazon should have sent thank-you cards to Mark Zuckerberg for drawing 100 percent of the fire recently from members of Congress, global regulators and skeptical tech journalists. But the fresh glimpse at Trump's thinking showed that there's plenty of unwanted attention to go around for the tech giants.  There's also general investor rethinking -- not for the first time -- about the tech concentration in the stock market after several years of outsize gains in the sector. As with market reaction to the tech backlash, this has little to do with the tech superpowers' current businesses, which remain solid. Nothing has changed. Except everything has changed.

Here\u2019s what the Street had to say about the performance:  Evercore ISI analyst Anthony DiClemente, who rates FB an outperform, said Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony was \"sometimes tedious, other times repetitive, but mostly -- and this is a good thing -- uneventful\"; he added that Zuckerberg delivered balanced and reasonable answers to questions and \"seemed to strike the right tone\" as he found plenty of common ground with the lawmakers; DiClemente saw little in the testimony that should negatively impact investors\u2019 view of Facebook\u2019s long-term growth and business opportunity  Suntrust analyst Youssef Squali, who rates FB a buy, said that while no major news emerged from the testimony, \"we believe that this is a seminal event, one that\u2019s likely to lead to increased regulation (a la GDPR)\" that should still favor larger platforms like FB and GOOGL in the end  Big Move, But Still Range Bound  Energy stocks had the best day of all (S5ENRS +3.3%, biggest upside move since Nov. 2016) thanks to a continuation of the rip in crude prices. The sector has been the big winner so far in April while the defensive sectors, like utilities and REITs, and the industrials (blame Brent oil\u2019s surge through $70/bbl for weakness in the airlines) have been clear laggards.  The market\u2019s move to the upside was on relatively decent volumes too. They were the second highest on the consolidated tape this month, and a major bounce back from Monday, where we saw the second lowest number all year.  We closed near the high end of the S&P\u2019s recent range, just shy of resistance at ~2,660 (while support still holds at the 200-day moving average of ~2,596) and we could see further optimism creep back into the market if we can break above this mark.  Excuses to Fade the Rally  But something we\u2019ve become accustomed to lately is these huge swings to the upside followed by swift plunges in the opposite direction, so it\u2019s altogether possible that investors will be looking for any excuse to fade yesterday\u2019s move.  Perhaps day two of Zuckerberg\u2019s grilling (scheduled for 10am) doesn\u2019t elicit the same response as day one, and the FAANGs, the semis, and the rest of tech fade hard -- Goldman is already out slashing estimates on chip darling NVDA and sell-rated AMD, with both stocks down ~1% in pre-market trading.  Maybe the latest headlines tied to Mueller, or the Cohen raid, or possible action in Syria will spill over into the market. Or perhaps a scorching hot CPI print (today at 8:30am), after yesterday\u2019s firmer-than-expected PPI, and some eyebrow-raising language in the FOMC Minutes (at 2pm) might help to spook the tape.  Watch the BKX for clues as we\u2019re only two days away from the kickoff to bank earnings. And as for tech\u2019s next major non-Facebook catalyst, it\u2019ll be NFLX\u2019s earnings on Monday after the close. The sell-side has been aggressively bumping up numbers over the past few days, so expectations are riding high: Morgan Stanley yesterday gave bull case $440 on higher conviction, Goldman today raised price target to $360 on a likely beat, and many others making similar tweaks to their models.

After all, the portfolio manager of the $4.5 billion Wells Fargo Growth Fund beat 93 percent of peers over the past year by piling into Amazon.com Inc. and Google\u2019s parent Alphabet Inc. But between Facebook Inc.\u2019s privacy scandal and the back-to-back fatal crashes at Uber Technologies Inc. and Tesla Inc., the tech-sector doubters are suddenly speaking out as one stock after another slides.  Ognar is unmoved: \u201cWe don\u2019t think the party is over.\u201d Nor do the bulk of his fund-manager peers, as it turns out. Behind the ugly headline losses -- including the FANG complex\u2019s worst-ever day on Tuesday -- there are data points that suggest that many funds are a long way from abandoning the industry that has added more to the wealth of U.S. stock investors over the past five years than any other. What\u2019s more, the Nasdaq 100 Index is actually the only major U.S. stock benchmark still in the green this quarter.  \u201cThink of things like your thermostat that used to be pretty basic and analogue. Now you can control them with your phone,\u201d said Ognar from his office in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin. \u201cYour coffee machine, your coffee maker -- it\u2019s a huge secular shift that hopefully will continue to put up sustainable growth.\u201d  The stance on Wall Street strikes a discordant note with the backlash building in Washington. While it\u2019s too early to say whether Facebook\u2019s woes will lead to meaningful losses in users and advertisers, the drumbeat for tighter regulation has some wondering if it\u2019s a watershed moment for an industry that promised to change the world for the better.  \u201cYou have the darlings of growth stocks that are going through some tough times, and it\u2019s not going to be a short and quick story,\u201d said Jennifer Ellison, a principal of San Francisco-based Bingham, Osborn & Scarborough, which manages $4.2 billion. \u201cThis is a tip of that iceberg.\u201d  Even Amazon, largely shielded until now, was hammered on Wednesday by talk of a tougher government stance. Axios reported that U.S. President Donald Trump is contemplating ways to \u201cgo after\u201d the e-commerce giant, including whether to wield tax or antitrust legislation. The shares were down 2.1 percent Thursday as of 10:34 a.m. in New York, while the Nasdaq 100 climbed 0.5 percent.  Trump features again when it comes to Apple Inc. shares, which are more than 8 percent off their record high partly on concerns about the prospect of a trade war between the U.S. and China. In a worst-case scenario, the U.S. could impose a tariff that affects iPhones and other Chinese-manufactured electronics. And car accidents have roiled market darlings Tesla Inc. and Nvidia Corp.  Not to worry, say analysts, who\u2019ve flooded email inboxes with reports reaffirming a bullish stance on the broader industry. The bull case? Tech fundamentals remain strong and, for all the worry over privacy, fake news and tech power, the U.S. giants are still cranking out products that people want to buy.  Facebook is sitting on a pile of cash so big that fines equaling the largest corporate penalties ever would amount to less than 7 percent of it. Alongside Google, its online dominance is so complete that there are few alternatives for users or advertisers.  Scarred, Intact  \u201cThey\u2019ll come out bruised and scarred but they\u2019ll come out intact,\u201d said James Cakmak, an analyst at Monness Crespi Hardt & Co. who has maintained his buy rating and $210 price target on Facebook. \u201cRadio and TV aren\u2019t the future, we know that, digital is. And it\u2019s not going to affect the direction of the dollars, which is toward Google and Facebook. The question is what is the speed that they get there.\u201d  The damage to all these stocks over the past couple weeks remains contained if viewed through a wider lens. Even after Tuesday\u2019s 7 percent rout, Nvidia\u2019s stock is double where it was a year ago. Tesla, while losing almost a fifth of its value this year, is still up sevenfold from the start of 2013.  Analyst estimates and fund flows show few signs of panic. In fact, profit forecasts for the tech industry have been barely changed over the past two weeks despite the market turmoil. At 30 percent, the expected pace of growth exceeds all but one industry in the S&P 500 Index.  Investors in ETFs seem in no rush to bail. Take the PowerShares QQQ Trust Series, the biggest fund tracking the Nasdaq 100. Outflows peaked around $2 billion on March 19 and trickled down to less than one-tenth of that amount Tuesday, a day when Nasdaq companies lost $260 billion in market value.  \u201cTech has given us more than it has taken away,\u201d said Kim Forrest, senior portfolio manager at Fort Pitt Capital Group LLC in Pittsburgh. \u201cThe future is going to have more connected devices.\u201d  \u2014 With assistance by Tom Giles", "stock": "NVDA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-28", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-28/in-precarious-moment-for-tech-stocks-are-still-finding-friends"}, {"article": "Facebook added to losses in high-flying tech peers on Monday. But today, they\u2019re standing strong.  Apple Inc., Netflix Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. are up at least 0.5 percent, compared with Facebook Inc.\u2019s dip of as much as 6.2 percent. The social media company has lost 12 percent this week, its biggest two-day retreat since 2012, based on closing prices.  News that a company linked to President Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign may have collected data from Facebook users without permission sparked concern that the social media giant -- and potentially its peers -- could face increased regulatory scrutiny. Investors seem to be mostly shrugging off this concern, at least for now. Shares of Facebook have been under pressure for months amid concern over the company\u2019s role in Russian meddling in the 2016 election, even as its peers in the FANG Index of tech megacaps managed to withstand the pressure.  \u201cWhile the last two days were exceedingly harsh, the stock has been losing ground on a relative basis for quite some time,\u201d said Frank Cappelleri, senior equity trader at Instinet LLC. \u201cWhat if Facebook continues to struggle but the rest of the market can shrug it off? That\u2019s just a question to consider.\u201d  A Congressional official familiar with the matter said Facebook tentatively agreed to brief House Judiciary members as early as Wednesday over the use of Facebook users\u2019 personal data by Cambridge Analytica, a firm hired as a consultant to Trump\u2019s campaign. The news helped the Nasdaq 100 Index erase earlier gains and briefly trade in the red. This compares with a 1.1 percent gain in Netflix, a 2.5 percent jump in Nvidia Corp. and a 2 percent rally in Amazon. Twitter Inc., facing its own potential regulatory scrutiny in Israel, fell 9.6% in its worst day since July.  What if tighter regulation spreads to market darlings like Amazon and Netflix? To Michael Purves, chief global strategist at Weeden & Co., it could force investors to rotate out of the group that has grown in strides, partly because of the absence of any regulatory pressure. To London Capital Group\u2019s Jasper Lawler, the potential regulation of tech megacaps will make investors question whether the group, which jumped twice as much as the S&P 500 Index last year, is still a smart purchase.  \u201cThe tech giant\u2019s fast-and-loose handing of private data will feed the niggling doubt investors have had all along that the big U.S. tech stocks cannot keep going up so rapidly forever,\u201d said Jasper Lawler, London Capital Group\u2019s head of research. \u201cLooking further out, legal action and greater industry regulation are huge headwinds \u2018the Zuck\u2019 has to contend with.\u201d  \u2014 With assistance by Stephen Sweeney", "stock": "NVDA", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-20", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-20/not-my-problem-tech-stocks-decouple-from-facebook-as-woes-mount"}, {"article": "Among those making heavy bets on technology stocks during the sector\u2019s worst week in nearly eight years were quant funds.  As of Wednesday, firms that use technology and formulas to automate the investment process had their highest gross exposure to the sector on record, according to Credit Suisse Group AG prime services data going back to 2013. At 18.4 percent, the measure of firms\u2019 long and short positioning was nearly 2 percentage points higher than for February.  Technology Overload Quant funds have boosted tech stock exposure 2 percentage points since start of year Source: Credit Suisse Services Risk Advisory  Quants on the Credit Suisse platform are roughly defined as funds that invest in thousands of equities and trade based on patterns, rather than making stock-specific bets.  It\u2019s mounting evidence that investors following some of the most popular quantitative strategies -- such as momentum investing -- are heavily concentrated in technology. Over the past year, chipmakers Micron Technology Inc. and Nvidia Corp. alone accounted for more than a tenth of gains in the Bloomberg pure U.S. momentum index, which tracks stocks that have gained the most over the past year.  Yet if quant investors had stepped in Wednesday programmed to expect dip-buying, they found no such luck. Following the funds\u2019 peak in technology exposure, the stocks fell about 5 percent to trade at the lowest in more than a month. For the week, global tech shares fell 7.3 percent.  On Monday, the stocks rallied back, with chipmakers among the biggest gainers in the S&P 500 Index.  As for fundamental managers, equity long-short hedge funds tracked by Credit Suisse maintained their elevated technology exposure, at about 22 percent of total holdings. Overall, equity managers appeared largely unmoved by last week\u2019s bout of selling, according to Mark Connors, the head of risk advisory at the Swiss bank.  \u201cStable equity gross and net positioning across most equity managers indicates recent volatility has not prompted unwinds at this point,\u201d Connors wrote in a Friday note. \u201cThe currently odd mix of hedge fund positioning reflects neither concern of further risk-off, nor longer-term optimism regarding global growth.\u201d", "stock": "NVDA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-26", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-26/quants-footprint-in-tech-hit-record-just-as-selloff-accelerated"}, {"article": "Investors in technology shares are concerned that the industry could be the next victim of the Trump administration\u2019s increasingly combative stance toward global trade partners.  While Donald Trump\u2019s broadsides this week against what he deemed unfair trade practices focused on industrial metals, comments he made over the past couple of months about the tech industry indicate it could soon come in for targeting as well. In January, Trump said the U.S. was considering a fine on China because it had forced U.S. companies to share their intellectual property as a cost of doing business there. Then in his first State of the Union address, Trump pledged \u201cstrong enforcement\u201d of U.S. rules that protect business secrets.  Those warnings are now sounding more ominous to investors concerned about a trade war between the world\u2019s two biggest economies.  Chris Krueger, an analyst at Cowen Washington Research, notes that semiconductors are one of six \u201ccore industries\u201d in Trump\u2019s America First agenda, along with steel, aluminum, vehicles, aircraft and shipbuilding. He said a U.S. Trade Representative report on forced technology transfers by China may come in a matter of weeks, way before the official Aug. 18 deadline, and could recommend tariffs or bans on Chinese investment or joint ventures.  If Trump does decide to crack down on intellectual property theft, U.S.-based semiconductor companies that have Chinese customers or factories in China could get caught in the crossfire. China is the largest market for the chip industry and if it were to retaliate some U.S. companies may suffer.  \u201cReciprocity on the part of China in IP crackdowns could have a substantial effect on manufacturing and IP of companies,\u201d said Matt Larson, a Bloomberg Intelligence litigation analyst.  One sector high-flier with significant China exposure, Nvidia Corp., had been up 25 percent year-to-date. It sold off as much as 5.7 percent yesterday after Trump made his steel tariff comments, and is dropped as far as 4.5 percent today before recovering. The move over the past two days is worse than the broader market selloff of about 2 percent, reflecting the concern about a Trump tech crackdown.

Quantitative investors have long used liquidity signals to strengthen their automated models. Simply put, bets on the least traded stocks should, in theory, outperform the market because there\u2019s a reward for taking on the extra liquidity risk.  But since December the opposite has been occurring, with the most liquid stocks rewarding investors to the greatest degree in nine years.  In normal times, heavily traded shares don\u2019t overlap much with momentum stocks. Reliable companies carry the market higher without any frenzied buying or selling. Amazon.com Inc., for example, has one of the lowest turnover ratios in the S&P 500 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Yet in a long-short Bloomberg index that bets on the most actively traded stocks, a hefty chipmaker presence has the gauge headed toward its best month since 2009. That semiconductor shares are rising so quickly despite a high turnover is an ominous signal, indicating that trigger-happy, short-term investors are wading into momentum, according to Vitali Kalesnik, head of equity research at Research Affiliates LLC.  Pure Panic  \u201cWhen you see very strong momentum combined with a sharp rise in trading volume, that can serve as a signal of overheating and speculative behavior,\u201d Kalesnik said by phone.\u201cThe issue with speculator money is they can come in and drive prices up and once they see signs of something happening, they quickly leave and drag prices down.\u201d  Nvidia Corp., VMware Inc. and Micron Technology Inc. hold the biggest positions in the Bloomberg trade activity portfolio, and have gained as much as 22 percent in January alone. But the potential for sharp reversals was put on display Wednesday, when semiconductor stocks in the S&P 500 tumbled 2.4 percent, the most in seven weeks, on the heels of a disappointing earnings report from Texas Instruments Inc.  The only other instances of liquid share outperformance occurred when equities began to recover from the bear market lows in 2002 and 2009. But the difference is that in those periods this was a healthy sign because the most beaten up shares had been oversold during the downturn, enabling them to outperform off those lows when the market rebounded, according to Joseph Mezrich, head of U.S. quantitative analysis at Nomura Instinet LLC.  This time, gains in the most liquid shares are pointing to pure panic, he said.  \u201cWhat you\u2019re observing is a panicked market,\u201d Mezrich said. \u201cYou have people panicking to get into these stocks because of a fear of missing out.

Trump had a few biting tweets out over the weekend, including one lashing out at the EU (\"we will simply apply a Tax on their Cars which freely pour into the U.S.\") and another about the state of America\u2019s steel and aluminum industry (\"Sorry, it\u2019s time for a change!\"). Meanwhile, Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro made it clear that there are no country exemptions to the tariffs, even for U.S. allies like Canada and Great Britain.  Major company-specific news from the weekend include a wrench thrown into Broadcom\u2019s $117 billion bid for Qualcomm (CFIUS issuing an order to delay tomorrow\u2019s vote) and reinsurer M&A with France\u2019s Axa buying XL Group for more than $15 billion, the largest-ever European acquisition of a U.S. insurer.  The market\u2019s focus has shifted quickly from inflation fears, and what the Fed is going to do about it, to the potential for an all-out trade war, and whether the threat from Trump is real or if he is testing the waters to gauge sentiment. The market will be paying close attention over the next few days to retaliatory efforts from the rest of the world, as well as Trump\u2019s next steps: Will he lob more insults at our trade partners? Will he ratchet up the call to exit Nafta (as talks come to a close tomorrow)? Will he clarify or walk the stiff tariff levels back?  Until now, stocks haven\u2019t felt too much of an impact from the recent noise out of D.C., of which there has been plenty over the past week or so. For example, the confusion over what to do about gun control, Lindsay Graham calling for a war with North Korea, Jared Kushner losing top security clearance, Hope Hicks resigning, The Mooch getting banned, and swirling speculation of key point people in the administration taking their leave, from Gary Cohn and H.R. McMaster to John Kelly and Jeff Sessions.  But given the recent shock from the tariff announcement as well as how the calendar is shaping up (we won\u2019t get a major inflationary datapoint until Friday\u2019s jobs & wage hike data), we should expect traders to pay much closer attention to the headlines coming out of the Trump administration in the near term. This is especially true if the rumors get louder about someone like Cohn throwing in the towel.  Scenario #1: Trump Escalates Trade War Fears  Here is what could happen if Trump doesn\u2019t back down on his tariff call (25% on imported steel, 10% on foreign aluminum) and keeps the potential for a trade war very broad by targeting the entire world instead of singling out a country like China:  Steel and aluminum stocks resume their vicious rally from last Thursday, when Trump shockingly introduced the tariffs: CLF surged 10%, AKS +9.5%, CENX +7.5%, X +5.8%, STLD +4%, and so on  NAFTA-exposed names take it further on the chin as the market turns sour on the prospects for a renegotiated pact; this would include the rails (especially KSU and the Canadians like CNI and CP), the autos (GM, FCAU, etc) and the auto parts companies (like MGA and LEA)  Semiconductors with exposure to China (NVDA, MU, AMD, INTC) could come under further pressure given read-across to some of Trump\u2019s past comments on the tech industry and whether he may decide to crack down on alleged intellectual property theft  Watch for rotation into small caps (Russell 2000 clear outperformer in past two sessions) and sectors that are more insulated to a potential trade war like biotechs (IBB ETF up 2.4% on Friday) and the banks  Focus on single-name stocks that have low exposure to a trade war; on Friday, Fundstrat\u2019s Tom Lee put out a bullish buy-the-dip note on equities where he listed 20 stocks that fit the bill given low export as percent of sales and low international sourcing as percent of COGS; included HSY, MSI, and a bunch of energy and healthcare names like EOG, HES, PXD, ALXN, AMGN, BIIB, and GILD  And some will just stick with what has worked, for example NFLX (which rose 5.3% last week to completely shrug off any weakness in FAANG or the SPX) and AMZN (which was flat last week); these two are up 57% and 28% year-to-date, respectively  Scenario #2: Trade War Fears Are Scaled Back  Here\u2019s what might happen if Trump caves in from all of the negativity surrounding the tariff announcement and walks back some of his comments from last week:  We\u2019ll likely see a reversal in some of the actions mentioned above, for example the metal stocks pare some of their tariff-fueled gains while the Nafta names, especially the autos, catch a relief rally  Expect strength in names that got hit late last week on speculation of how the tariffs might crimp margins, for instance heavy machinery like CAT, DE, TEX, MTW and truck machinery like CMI and PCAR Sidenote: Truck machinery names got some good news late Friday night after preliminary Class 8 data for February showed elevated demand (positive for CMI, PCAR, and NAV)  May also see outperformance in HOG, which got caught in the crossfire of potential retaliation from the EU  Tick-by-Tick Guide to Today\u2019s Actionable Events", "stock": "NVDA", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-05", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-05/here-s-how-to-trade-trump-s-next-trade-war-tweet-taking-stock"}, {"article": "Megacap tech shares slumped again Wednesday as pessimism about the sector showed few signs of letting up.

Beijing meeting  China\u2019s official Xinhua News Agency said that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is willing to talk with U.S. President Donald Trump about giving up his nuclear weapons after Kim\u2019s surprise visit to the Chinese capital. The report on possible nuclear concessions, which was not echoed by North Korean state media, gave further impetus to the potential meeting between Kim and Trump expected in May.

Brexit countdown  With just over a year to go to the U.K.\u2019s exit from the European Union, Prime Minister Theresa May said the post-Brexit transition phase may end up being longer than currently planned due to the difficulties in establishing a new customs regime and avoiding a hard border with Ireland. Bloomberg reporters traveled throughout the U.K. to gauge the public mood, and it seems that the only certainty with Brexit so far is that most people still do not know what a post-EU U.K. will look like.

There's no U.S. firm more at risk from trade retaliation.  If there's a poster child for the tonic the current U.S. government has delivered to the country's corporate sector, it's Boeing Co.  Fueled by Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg's cozy relationship with President Donald Trump, orders for Super Hornet fighter jets and corporate tax cuts, its 146 percent share-price increase since election day in 2016 has outpaced every other company on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.    Thursday's 3.5 percent fall after Trump tweeted out plans to impose tariffs on metal imports should be a warning sign that, beyond the current clear skies, a storm is building.  One obvious risk is increased costs. About 80 percent of an aircraft's weight is aluminum, and Trump's promise to slap levies of 10 percent on imports of that metal represents a pricing handicap in Muilenburg's endless battle for market share with Airbus SE.  Flying High Boeing has put in by far the best share-price performance of any company on the Dow since Trump's election Source: Bloomberg  At the same time, that blow is likely to be cushioned by the fact that managing raw-materials costs is part and parcel of being a manufacturer. Aluminum prices have risen or fallen by 10 percent or more in all but eight of the past 30 years. Boeing, moreover, isn't a major buyer of aluminum straight from the pot: Most of its supply comes from Arconic Inc., the specialty-products half of the old Alcoa Corp. business. Shares of Arconic slipped 1.5 percent on Thursday, an indication it's expected to take part of the hit.  The bigger risk depends on how the coming days and months are handled.  There's probably no U.S. firm more at risk of trade retaliation from China than Boeing. Of the 10 American businesses that declare more than $5 billion of sales in the country, three -- Apple Inc., Las Vegas Sands Corp. and Procter & Gamble Co. -- are dependent on consumer spending, so probably somewhat immune to government diktats. Six more are in the semiconductor and tech businesses that China wants to encourage domestically, so they should also enjoy a degree of protection. Against that backdrop, Boeing stands out like a sore thumb.  Odd One Out Boeing is the only non-consumer, non-tech U.S. company that declares more than $5 billion in revenue from China Source: Bloomberg  Most of its biggest customers in China are state-owned airlines and lessors affiliated with government-controlled banks. The few independent players could easily be leaned on by authorities to defer existing orders.  China Inc. has a sound self-interested rationale for pursuing an aggressive path. Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China Ltd., or Comac, is hoping to pitch its C919 jet as a home-grown competitor to Boeing's 737 and Airbus's A320, and announced last month it would make its first delivery in 2021.  Using a trade war to put one of the C919's rivals on the back foot seems the perfect way to crack open the Boeing-Airbus duopoly and advance the interests of China's own manufacturers. Should the current tit-for-tat over steel and aluminum spiral toward a trade war, few firms will find themselves in a more precarious position than Boeing.

The company, which specializes in systems that analyze faces and images on an enormous scale, said it closed a Series C round in recent months in which Singaporean state investment firm Temasek Holdings Pte and retailer Suning.com Co. also participated. SenseTime didn\u2019t outline individual investments, but Alibaba was said to have sought the biggest stake in the three-year-old startup.  With the deal, SenseTime has doubled its valuation in a few months. Backed by Qualcomm Inc., it underscores its status as one of a crop of homegrown firms spearheading Beijing\u2019s ambition to become the leader in AI by 2030. And it\u2019s a contributor to the world\u2019s biggest system of surveillance: if you\u2019ve ever been photographed with a Chinese-made phone or walked the streets of a Chinese city, chances are your face has been digitally crunched by SenseTime software built into more than 100 million mobile devices.  The latest financing will bankroll investments in parallel fields such as autonomous driving and augmented reality, cover the growing cost of AI talent and shore up its computing power. It\u2019s developing a service code-named \u201cViper\u201d to parse data from thousands of live camera feeds -- a platform it hopes will prove invaluable in mass surveillance. And it\u2019s already in talks to raise another round of funds and targeting a valuation of more than $4.5 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.  \u201cWe\u2019re going to explore several new strategic directions and that\u2019s why we shall spend more money on building infrastructure,\u201d SenseTime co-founder Xu Li said in an interview.

SenseTime plans to build at least five supercomputers in top-tier cities over the coming year to drive Viper and other services. As envisioned, it streams thousands of live feeds into a single system that\u2019re automatically processed and tagged, via devices from office face-scanners to ATMs and traffic cameras (so long as the resolution is high enough). The ultimate goal is to juggle 100,000 feeds simultaneously.  Police can use Viper to track everything from vice and accidents to suspects on blacklists. While civil libertarians say such systems have been used to track activists and oppress minorities in places like the Western region of Xinjiang, Xu believes the technology is essential and deployed in various ways by authorities around the world. China\u2019s police forces and surveillance footage are also important sources of training data for SenseTime\u2019s image recognition systems -- it claims to work with 40 city authorities in the country.  \u201cIt will not affect privacy because only authorized persons can access it,\u201d he said.  SenseTime claims some 400 clients and partners including Qualcomm, chipmaker Nvidia Corp. and smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp. For 2018, it\u2019s projecting several billion yuan in revenues, Xu said. The startup\u2019s expanding its reach across augmented reality, popularized by services like Snapchat that impose digital stickers and images on the real world. And it\u2019s working with Honda Motor Co. to develop autonomous driving systems and is in talks to work with health institutions.  \u201cIn China there is an advantage in areas like facial recognition because of the privacy that exists in the U.S. and elsewhere in the EU, and some of the very best facial recognition technology in the world that I\u2019ve seen is in China,\u201d said Breyer Capital founder Jim Breyer, an indirect investor in SenseTime through IDG.  SenseTime is the largest, according to CB Insights, of a plethora of private AI outfits. Fellow facial-recognition startup Megvii Inc. raised $460 million last year, while smaller niche players from Yitu to Malong Technologies have also won funding. A key partner, Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology, is one of the world\u2019s biggest suppliers of security cameras and developing its own competing AI technology.  Xu says its ability to work across wide datasets and diverse products sets it apart from rivals. \u201cWhat is difficult is if you\u2019re dealing with different video streams in different formats,\u201d he said.

Cryptocurrencies have provided Nvidia, and other chipmakers, with a big boost to their top line in recent quarters.  Crypto miners have been buying up huge swaths of GPUs as the prices of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies skyrocketed. The huge demand drained Nvidia's supply chains and sent the prices of the cards soaring in secondary markets. All of this extra demand is estimated to have boosted Nvidia's revenue in the fourth quarter, but that leaves Nvidia with a big problem as it looks to report earnings on Thursday.  \"We think the Company will need to see material Outperformance to see appreciation on the print (largely due to near-term run-up),\" Mitch Steves, an analyst at RBC, said in a note to clients on Tuesday.

The company can't just report overall revenue growth, it will have to show that it's growing revenue outside of its graphics division because the boost from crypto could eventually disappear as prices of cryptocurrencies fluctuate and interest wanes.  AMD, Nvidia's main rival in the GPU space, saw its shares plummet about 6% immediately after reporting an across-the-board beat on earnings. AMD said it got a 5-6% boost in annual revenue in 2017, and said about 1/3 of its growth in its graphics and computing division was from increased GPU demand from cryptocurrencies, which wasn't enough for investors watching the earnings.

Citron Research and Goldman Sachs both recently expressed concerns over how much Nvidia has risen over the past year because of enthusiasm around crypto demand, leading Citron to lower its price target and Goldman to remove the stock from its conviction list. Both firms are still bullish on Nvidia in the long term.  Steves thinks new data center chips will revitalize growth in that unit. Nvidia is also working on more partnerships for its autonomous driving chips that should improve sales as more automakers release cars with self-driving capabilities, even if they are initially limited.

Goldman Sachs and Citron Research both announced a pullback on their optimism while maintaining a good overall outlook.  Watch Nvidia trade in real time here.    Nvidia's short-term future is looking bleak.  The stock is down 1.52% to $236.84 after Goldman Sachs removed Nvidia from its conviction list, and Citron said the stock is about to drop about 15% to $200.  The two firms are both concerned about how red-hot Nvidia shares have been recently. Shares have been on a meteoric tear over the last year, gaining 104.31%, as revenues grew just 11%. In 2018, stock has posted a 16.74% gain, which Citron thinks is too much.  \"Is Nvidia really worth $36 billion more than it was New Years Eve with $15k BTC?\" Citron asked on Twitter. Nvidia has gotten a boost from cryptocurrency miners buying huge numbers of graphics cards to speed up their rigs, especially as the price of bitcoin hit its high of nearly $20,000 in December. Prices have come crashing down to just under $9,000, which could mean demand from miners could wane.  Citron and Goldman both fear the boost Nvidia has seen from cryptocurrency mining is unsustainable and unreliable as a way to grow sales. Goldman said it could lead to volatile earnings as Wall Street struggles to find concrete ways to predict the demand of the crypto market.  For context, during its recent earnings call, AMD's leadership said crypto mining added about $300 million in revenue, or about 5-6%, in 2017. Nvidia is set to report its earnings, and its boost from crypto mining, on February 8.  Crypto isn't the only worry for Nvidia, though.  The company's data center business was just starting when Goldman added the stock to its conviction list in late 2016. Since then, it's exploded as artificial intelligence and cloud computing have become the hottest new trend in enterprise computing. The sector is now better understood, which means more players are starting to nip at the heels of Nvidia's dominance, according to Citron.

Still, the bank is raising its price target for the chipmaker citing tax reform and video games.  Nvidia got a major boost from the explosion of interest around cryptocurrencies in 2017, but that's facing a \"notable slowdown,\" RBC Capital Markets has warned.  \"With crypto currencies acting as a boost in FY18E, we take a conservative approach and assume that a notable slowdown occurs in FY19E,\" analyst Mitch Steves said in a note to clients Wednesday. \"Higher end chips typically lead to better mining capabilities and the lower end products will unlikely sell out consistently.\"  At the height of the crypto boom in December, when the price of bitcoin was near $20,000 a coin, Nvidia\u2019s chips were regularly selling out at stores across the country. Once popular almost exclusively among PC gamers, the chips had found a new market that was insatiable in the demand for mining equipment.  Still, other solid signs under the surface led RBC to upgrade its price target for the stock by another $5 a share, to $285, a 15% premium to the stock\u2019s price of $249 early Wednesday.  \"We are raising our price target on Nvidia to reflect 1) new upside case scenario of $12+ in FY21E EPS, 2) confidence in Data Center spending given positive results across major data center players and continued strong demand for memory, 3) solid gaming results driven by pent up demand and new video games requiring a doubling in size and 4) higher long-term gross margin expectations for Pro Visualization and Gaming,\" Steves wrote.  Gaming, specifically, is a major highlight for RBC, which says \u201cVR units could become more material in 2019 if content is created over the next 12-18 months,\u201d something other Wall Street analysts have also predicted.  Earlier this week, Jefferies said both Nvidia and AMD could see a boost from Steven Spielberg's \"Ready Player One,\" which features an entire virtual reality universe inside the futuristic movie.

The company proved to investors that it isn't relying on volatile cryptocurrency demand for its growth.  Watch the company trade in real time here.    Nvidia reported a record fourth-quarter on Thursday, and shares are trading up more than 10% in early trading.  Wall Street was largely expecting the company to beat on earnings but was worried good numbers would rely on unreliable and volatile cryptocurrency demand. Nvidia's earnings show it's more than just a crypto company though, soothing those investors fears.  \"1) Data Center growth of 20% or more? (Check, 21.0%); 2) Gaming growth of 5-6% or more? (Check, 11.4%); 3) Gross margins in the 60s? (Check, 62.1%) and 4) Guidance of down 1-3% sequentially?

Ahead of the report, some analysts were worried Nvidia would have trouble showing it could sustain growth outside of its graphics division. Cryptocurrency miners contributed about $70 million in sales during the third quarter, and Steves estimates the miners added about $180 million in sales during the fourth quarter.  AMD, Nvidia's main rival in the space, said about one-third of its graphics division growth came from cryptocurrency miners, which led some investors to worry if the company would be growing without the wildly volatile cryptocurrency market. After it's earnings report, it looks like Nvidia isn't facing the same problems.  The one blip in Nvidia's stellar report came from the sluggish growth in its automotive division. Nvidia's chips for power infotainment systems and self-driving cars are off to a slow start, but the company could just be a bit too far ahead of the curve, Steves said. In a couple years, when autonomous cars become more popular and more advanced, the 3% growth will start to be a bigger problem.  Steves rates Nvidia as an \"outperform\" and has a $280 price target, about 22% higher than the current price.

When the D.M.V. opened the mailed application on Friday, it called the company to confirm, a department spokeswoman said, and Uber asked to withdraw the request. The D.M.V. asked for the withdrawal in writing, and it received an email on Saturday.  Uber has said it is cooperating with investigations by the Tempe police, the National Transportation Safety Board and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. None of the investigations have determined whether Uber was at fault in the crash.  The intense focus on the accident has also prompted Uber\u2019s suppliers to evaluate its technology. On Tuesday, a spokesman for Nvidia, a supplier of semiconductors and other computer hardware used in Uber\u2019s autonomous vehicles, said it was suspending its tests of self-driving cars on public roads in order to \u201clearn from the Uber incident.\u201d The price of Nvidia shares fell 8 percent on the news.

And as we\u2019ve seen after previous fervors, investors can take a long time to regain their faith.  Facebook is down 20 percent from its recent high. Most of the slide came after news reports showing how the company\u2019s data was misused. Investors have to grapple with the possibility that Facebook won\u2019t be sharing as much data as it does, undermining its ability to generate ever-increasing amounts of advertising revenue.  Nvidia, a computer chip maker intent on being a leader in automated driving technology, is off 12 percent from its recent high. The company said on Tuesday that it would halt tests of its autonomous driving technology on public roads after an Uber self-driving car hit and killed a pedestrian in Arizona.  Tesla is not a tech stock, but it is included in the FANG+ index, and its supporters believe deeply in its power to revolutionize the auto industry. Growing fears about Tesla\u2019s ability to finance its expansion have helped drag its stock down 33 percent from its recent high. Ominously, the price of Tesla\u2019s bonds is also falling, signaling that the company is losing the confidence of creditors.  Of course, on their march higher, tech stocks overcame obstacles, like management problems at Uber and the poor performance of Snap\u2019s initial public offering.  But the latest problems have raised deeper, broader doubts, and that may keep the uncertainty around longer. Investors have viewed automated driving technology as a huge potential source of growth for some companies. But after the Uber incident in Arizona, those companies may take a more realistic look at what they have to spend to create a technology that is efficient and safe, and conclude that they have to pull out of the race or pare back. Users of social media and regulators may prevent social media companies from sharing so much of their data with advertisers, and that could restrain revenue growth.  And if the passion for two or three big tech companies wanes, the cooling may spread.  \u2014 Peter Eavis  Amazon has shed more than $50 billion in market value.  The reason?  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Reports that President Trump wants to rein in the e-commerce giant.  Jonathan Swan of Axios, citing anonymous sources, reported:  \u201cTrump has talked about changing Amazon\u2019s tax treatment because he\u2019s worried about mom-and-pop retailers being put out of business.\u201d  Mr. Swan added:  \u201cTrump\u2019s wealthy friends tell him Amazon is destroying their businesses. His real estate buddies tell him \u2014 and he agrees \u2014 that Amazon is killing shopping malls and brick-and-mortar retailers.\u201d  Shares of Amazon have tumbled more than 7 percent at one point Wednesday, but they pared those losses after a White House official told Reuters there were no specific policy changes related to Amazon being considered at the moment. But the official added that the administration is always looking at different options on a range of policy issues.  How concerned should investors be?  GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives writes:  \u201cWhile it\u2019s now a hand holding time for Amazon given this new regulatory potential threat, we believe the reality of these worries altering the company\u2019s business model and future tax structure are low and we would be buyers of the name on weakness.\u201d  Guess which companies are benefiting from Amazon's woes? Retailers, the FT points out.  On a day when the stocks on Wall Street are flat, Macy\u2019s was up 3.5 percent, J.C. Penney has gained 5.5 percent, Walmart rose 1.7 percent, Target increased 1.8 percent, and Kohl\u2019s was up 2.4 percent.  Photo  Are investors waking up to Tesla\u2019s real problem?  The electric carmaker\u2019s shares are down 7 percent Wednesday, after plunging 8 percent on Tuesday.  Tuesday\u2019s slide was driven, in part, by the National Transportation Safety Board\u2019s announcement that it was investigating a fatal crash last week involving a Tesla vehicle in California. News that Jaguar Land Rover was teaming up with Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Waymo unit probably didn't help either.  But the continued decline in Tesla\u2019s stock \u2014 its shares are down more than 20 percent since mid-March \u2014 speaks to the bigger concern surrounding Tesla: How it funds itself.  Investors have grown increasingly worried as Tesla burns through cash and struggles to meet its own production goals for the Model 3. Late Tuesday, Moody\u2019s downgraded Tesla\u2019s credit rating further into junk territory and said its outlook on the company is negative. The credit ratings agency cited production delays and said Tesla may soon need to raise more than $2 billion.  Those concerns can be seen not just in Tesla\u2019s stock price but also in the trading of its debt. The FT points out that \u201cTesla\u2019s eight-year bond maturing in 2025 traded on Wednesday at 87.6 cents to the dollar, the lowest since issuance. The yield has surged to 7.5 percent from 6.59 percent on Monday.\u201d  Liam Denning of Bloomberg Gadfly writes:  \u201cChallenges on the factory floor and the balance sheet are converging. Drawing inexorably closer to a refinancing wall, Tesla needs a real shot of confidence, and capital, to keep its money machine turning over this year. \u201cGiven Tuesday\u2019s bond blowout, that almost certainly means tapping the equity market again. Nothing like being a motivated seller to put a floor under a stock price, right?\u201d  Is Twitter vulnerable to privacy regulation?  The fallout from Facebook\u2019s Cambridge Analytica scandal has spread to Twitter.  The stock tumbled 12 percent Tuesday after Citron Research\u2019s Andrew Left said he was betting against the social media company because of its vulnerability to regulation around how it handles user data.  But analysts at Barclays disagree. They argue in a recent note to clients that Twitter\u2019s data business likely won\u2019t be impacted much by any regulation on its use of user data.

But with Mr. Trump preparing to meet with North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un \u2014 who just took an armored train trip to Beijing \u2014 and the North apparently pressing on with nuclear developments, an \u201cAmerica first\u201d trade stance was far from the only thing pushing the South to sign. More from Michael D. Shear and Alan Rappeport:  The political success of the trade agreement \u2014 and its ability to be replicated in other negotiations \u2014 is not guaranteed. Many countries have reacted coolly to Washington\u2019s pugilistic approach to trade, viewing the president\u2019s preference to punch first and negotiate later as counter to global interests.  The Trump administration continues to ramp up its trade rhetoric with China. Unidentified sources told Bloomberg that it is considering invoking an emergency law to restrict Chinese investments in sensitive U.S. tech. A separate plan to enact tariffs on $60 billion of Chinese goods has left companies wondering which industries will be targeted. Other Asian countries increasingly fear being caught in the crossfire of a trade war, the WSJ reports.

NVDA -1.32% is scheduled to announce earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter after the market closes Thursday. Here\u2019s what to look for:  EARNINGS FORECAST: Analysts expect Nvidia to report per-share earnings of $1.16 cents, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters, up 17% from the same quarter a year earlier.  REVENUE FORECAST: Analysts expect total revenue of $2.68 billion for the quarter, up 23% from a year earlier.  WHAT TO WATCH:  CHIPS FOR AI: Sales to giant internet companies are the biggest driver of Nvidia\u2019s stock, analysts say. Customers like Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com and Microsoft Corp. have been buying up the company\u2019s graphics chips to drive artificial-intelligence calculations that help them, for instance, auto-tag objects in photos. Data-center growth, which has increased by double digits from quarter to quarter for most of the last two years, declined to 2% in the second quarter, then rebounded to 20% in the third. Investors will be looking for sustained momentum, said analyst Mitch Steves of RBC Capital Markets LLC. He\u2019s looking for mid-single to double-digit sequential growth in data-center sales.  CRYPTOCURRENCY MINING: Miners of electronic currencies like Ethereum have embraced graphics cards to speed up calculations that unearth the digital coins. But such sales, which Nvidia reports in its gaming and OEM segments, are a double-edged sword for the company, analysts said: They\u2019ve been bringing in substantial revenue in recent quarters, but they might disappear if the vogue for cryptocurrency mining wanes. \u201cNvidia has played down importance of crypto because they know it can be fickle depending on the price of the currency, and they want to support their fan base among gamers,\u201d said Stifel Financial Corp. analyst Kevin Cassidy. It is hard to differentiate between online sales to gamers and purchases by miners, he said, but investors will be looking for clues to crypto-related revenue in the quarter and beyond.  NEXT-GEN GAMING CARDS: Sales of gaming gear account for more than half of Nvidia\u2019s annual revenue, propelled by new products. The company has been shipping data-center chips based on its Volta design in significant volume since last summer, but it hasn\u2019t said on when, or even whether, it will roll out gaming cards based on the new architecture. \u201cThe timing is something people will be curious about because it should provide a decent tailwind,\u201d said analyst Blayne Curtis of Barclays PLC.

NVDA -1.32% , which has made a broad push to bring its computing platform into self-driving cars, said Tuesday it will temporarily halt testing of its driverless technology on public roads following the fatal crash of an Uber Technologies Inc. autonomous vehicle.

Uber has also used Nvidia\u2019s computing technology in its Volvo XC90 SUVs, the same type of vehicle that struck a pedestrian on March 18 in Tempe, Ariz. The two companies in January officially announced that Uber selected Nvidia\u2019s artificial-intelligence computing system for its fleet of self-driving cars and freight trucks.

It isn\u2019t clear if Nvidia\u2019s technology was in the car that struck 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg, who later died of her injuries.  \u201cMost self-driving vehicle prototypes and test vehicles use Nvidia technology,\u201d an Nvidia spokesman said in a statement. \u201cIn some case, customers are developing their own software and we don\u2019t have details of their algorithms.\u201d The spokesman said Nvidia is seeking to find out more details on Uber\u2019s configuration and software.  An Uber spokeswoman declined to comment on the matter.  Police said the Uber vehicle was traveling at about 40 miles an hour and didn\u2019t brake before hitting Ms. Herzberg, who was crossing her bike outside of a crosswalk. Specialists in autonomous technology said the car\u2019s sensors should have detected Ms. Herzberg, and that the car\u2019s artificial-intelligence system should have understood she was a pedestrian.  Following the crash, Uber said it was temporarily suspending testing of its self-driving cars in four cities as investigators studied the incident. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey on Monday barred Uber from testing its cars in the state. At least one auto maker, Toyota Motor Corp. , decided to temporarily halt public testing of its own self-driving vehicles.  Nvidia, a graphics-chip specialist that lately has become the leader in chips for artificial intelligence, said in a prepared statement it was temporarily suspending tests \u201cto learn from the Uber incident.\u201d Its fleet of cars for data collection, which are driven by human drivers, will continue to operate.  Nvidia\u2019s stock was recently down more than 7% to $226.39 on Tuesday following the company\u2019s announcement, which was reported earlier by Reuters.  Nvidia has made big bets on developing artificial intelligence for self-driving cars, and competes head-to-head with Intel Corp. in developing autonomous technology. The company said Tuesday it is working with 370 companies on autonomous vehicle technology, including auto makers such as Audi AG , Daimler AG , Toyota, Volkswagen AG and Volvo Group.  Nvidia has emphasized safety in its autonomous-vehicle program. On Tuesday, the chip maker introduced a system for training self-driving cars using simulation rather than real-world driving of the type that resulted in the fatality in Arizona.  That system feeds computer-generated imagery into the company\u2019s automotive brain, as though the car were viewing the world through cameras and other sensors. The brain\u2019s reactions feed back into the simulator, which alters its imagery accordingly. The technology allows self-driving cars to encounter particular hazards any number of times so they can fine-tune their responses, the company said, ultimately improving their handling of real-world conditions.  In January, Nvidia announced that its self-driving car platform met the international safety standard known as ISO 26262, including features such as redundant functions in case one part of a system fails.

Above, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang speaks at CES earlier this year. Photo: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg News  Nvidia NVDA -1.32% and Facebook are two very different companies. But both have recently come to learn a painful lesson: When tech is everywhere, so are the risks.  Facebook, of course, has been battered over its handling of user data. Nvidia\u2019s challenges are very different. The company, whose main business is making chips for videogames, has spent the past couple of years aggressively building chips designed to run self-driving cars. This has led to partnerships with several auto makers as well as companies like Uber, which has been developing its own fleet of autonomous vehicles.  But the problem with putting tech in the driver\u2019s seat is that the buck tends to stop there as well. One of Uber\u2019s self-driving cars was involved in a fatal accident on March 18. Nvidia\u2019s technology wasn\u2019t blamed for the incident, and CEO Jensen Huang said late Wednesday that Uber doesn\u2019t even use the company\u2019s self-driving car system.  But Nvidia still elected to temporarily suspend tests of the vehicles using its platform while investigating the matter. That has meant a lot of bucks for Nvidia\u2019s investors. The highflying stock has shed 12%\u2014nearly $18 billion in market value\u2014since the accident.  Nvidia still generates most of its sales from graphics chips used in videogames. But the company\u2019s significant advancements with artificial intelligence has opened the door to new and expansive opportunities. Companies like Google, Microsoft and Amazon are snapping up Nvidia\u2019s chips to deploy artificial intelligence capabilities in their data centers. Nvidia\u2019s sales into this segment more than doubled in the fiscal year ended January and are expected to surge more than 60% this year to about $3.2 billion. The company also told analysts on Tuesday that it now sees its total addressable market in this space as being worth about $50 billion in the next five years.  The opportunity for self-driving cars is further out. Nvidia is projected to get 5% of its total revenue from autos in the next two years, but much of that will come from infotainment systems, not autonomous vehicles. But while that may limit the actual business risk, Nvidia\u2019s name is now closely synced to the development of autonomous cars. That means mishaps involving those types of cars will likely weigh on the company\u2019s shares.  That is far different from Facebook, whose core business is under fire. Yet both stocks have fallen sharply over the past two weeks. Nvidia\u2019s was hit so hard in part because its market value has doubled over the past year.  That has put the chipmaker\u2019s value on par with that of much-larger tech names like IBM . Nvidia also is one of the more expensive chip stocks on the market at 35 times forward earnings, though its rapidly expanding bottom line has moderated that valuation a bit. The company\u2019s record to this point suggests it can still deliver on some outsize expectations. But investors should be ready for new twists in the road.

It might also be sniffing another danger, from economics.  Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix\u2019s sales pitch was simple and powerful: his firm\u2019s personality-profiling ability would let politicians win votes by tapping into people\u2019s deepest fears and desires. Clients of the company, including Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, said Cambridge Analytica struggled to make good on Nix\u2019s bold claims.

The logo for Twitter, which fell more than Facebook on Tuesday, on a phone post at the New York Stock Exchange in 2015. Photo: Richard Drew/Associated Press  The highflying technology stocks had been ignoring rising threats for a while. Reality reasserted itself on Tuesday.  The immediate cause for plummeting tech shares was company-specific: Chip maker Nvidia Corp. NVDA -1.32% halted road tests of driverless vehicles after an Uber Technologies Inc. test car was involved in a fatal crash, and Facebook Inc. FB 0.40% CEO Mark Zuckerberg will be hauled before Congress. The announcements highlighted the risks to two of the biggest tech disruption themes, self-driving cars and social media.  But the market fall wasn\u2019t just about Facebook and Nvidia, or even self-driving cars and social media, although the themes mattered, with Tesla Inc. dropping more than Nvidia, and Twitter Inc. TWTR -0.83% losing more than Facebook.  Instead, the market is waking up to an even broader threat: politics. It might also be sniffing another danger, from economics.  The political risk is obvious for Facebook, which stands at the unpleasant intersection of privacy fears and fake news. Facebook is accused of unwittingly aiding the manipulation of the U.S. election by Russian agents, of helping swing the Brexit referendum and, linked to both cases, failing to notice that the personal details of 50 million users had been snatched.  The arguments about who, what, where and why are far from being resolved, but Facebook highlights the forces gathering against tech investors. Disruptive companies are bound to make powerful enemies in old industries, but the tech companies have alienated many natural supporters among the wider public through their swagger, wealth and tax avoidance. Businesses that were once beloved by consumers for taking on the corporate establishment have become the corporate establishment in the eyes of many of their customers.  Cities and states were first to flex their muscles, forcing companies such as Uber and Airbnb Inc. to follow local rules and pay taxes. The threats now are much bigger.  The European Commission is pushing for a 3% tax on the revenue of internet giants, while pressure is increasing for \u201cgig economy\u201d workers to be treated as employees. The rush by companies to pull their ads from Facebook may be merely temporary, but it shows just how far the social network has slumped in public opinion and how much privacy is becoming an issue for Americans. In Europe, privacy rules have just been tightened again.  There is also a backlash to the sheer scale of many of the big internet companies. Earnest discussion among economists about the new monopolies is unlikely to lead directly to government intervention, but a change in public perception makes antitrust action more likely. Again, Europe has been leading the way by taking on Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google.  There is a further danger, from the economy. A stronger economy should mean more companies are able to demonstrate rising sales. Investors who want growth will be able to buy businesses exposed to the economic cycle, and the fast-expanding tech companies will lose some of their exclusivity in the minds of shareholders. The same point can be seen by looking at interest rates. As rates rise, profits far in the future look less attractive, which should compress the valuation of disrupters reinvesting all their earnings in the hope of future returns. If\u2014and it is a big if\u2014you expect the economy to improve and bond yields to rise, disruptive tech stocks should be less appealing.  Tech stocks rode high in the past three years, ignoring all these concerns as investors focused on the extraordinary profits and dominant market shares many were producing. Sentiment was overly positive, and the backlash was ignored.  It isn\u2019t always true that highflying stocks fall further, but it certainly was on Tuesday. Out of the top 100 stocks in the S&P 500 for the year to Monday, 39 were in the bottom 100 on Tuesday, about double what would be expected by chance. It worked the other way, too, with just over one-third of the bottom 100 stocks for the year in the top 100 on Tuesday, led by General Electric Co. , the fifth-worst performer this year and the best on Tuesday.  In the short run, the drop means the overly fast upward momentum of the big tech stocks has abated, leaving them less exposed to further selling driven by technical factors, although Amazon.com Inc. led more falls on Wednesday after a report that President Donald Trump wants to target the company.  In the longer run, expect lots of contrition from tech company CEOs as they try to head off political pressure on the bottom line.

Now investors are dealing with a new menace, and it\u2019s wreaking more havoc than anything in two years.  It\u2019s the bond market, where the biggest jump for interest rates since March has bulls questioning the staying power of an equity advance now seven months from being the longest ever. So drastic is the runup in yields that it\u2019s knocking stocks down during a period when analysts are pushing up earnings estimates four times faster than any time since 2012.  Looking at the week\u2019s drumbeat, you can\u2019t help but wonder, is this the start of something big? Warnings about valuations have been pouring forth from bears for so long that barely anyone listens anymore. With the S&P 500 up almost 50 percent in less than two years, some see the end of the blissfully easy money that equities have spewed out for 13 straight months.  For more on the equity selloff:  Everything\u2019s Expensive in Stocks Now Vulnerable to Lockstep Pain  Signs of Old Age Abound in a Bull Market Closing on History  It\u2019s Getting Hard for S&P 500 to Elude Bond Market Violence  One Indicator Says Bond Rout Going Too Fast for Stocks to Escape  \u201cIt\u2019s the turning point of volatility,\u201d said Jeffrey Schulze, chief investment strategist at Clearbridge Investments, which manages $137 billion. \u201cWe were all very fortunate to go through a year like 2017. But there\u2019s a number of different dynamics this year that will make volatility more part of the equation than it has been in quite some time.\u201d  \u201cBut it\u2019s definitely not the end of the bull market,\u201d Schulze said. \u201cIn order to see the end of the bull market, you need to see the U.S. go into a recession. We have an economic dashboard at Clearbridge, 12 variables that have done a very good job of foreshadowing an economic downturn. Out of the 12 variables, only one of them is flashing any type of caution.\u201d  When Friday\u2019s dust cleared, the S&P 500 was down 2.1 percent on the day to 2,762.13, and 3.9 percent for the week -- the most since January 2016. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 665.75 points to 25,520.96, bringing its total points lost over five days to 1,095.75. The Nasdaq 100 Index fell 3.7 percent for the week while the Cboe Volatility Index surged 56 percent.  The most significant feature of this selloff has been its breadth. While past declines in the U.S. stock market have been notable for their narrowness -- when one industry fell, another rose -- this time there\u2019s been no cushion. All 11 industries in the S&P 500 declined in the last week, something that hasn\u2019t happened since the month of Donald Trump\u2019s election.  Selling has also been spread among asset classes. A simple comparison that adds up percentage losses in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF and iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF showed a concerted selloff that was the worst since January 2009.  The swoons are taking a toll on one of the most popular asset allocation strategies: those lumped together under the rubric of 60/40 mutual funds. Among 35 such funds that have at least $1 billion in assets, all suffered losses during the week. Their decline averaged 1.2 percent, the most since September 2016, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  A big concern for investors is the timing of the rout -- the middle of earnings season, a calendar period that for the last six years has a nearly perfect record of boosting stocks. Bulls hoping for a broader celebration of brisk iPhone X demand at Apple or surging holiday sales Amazon.com were disappointed. Even the seventh straight weekly upgrades to S&P 500 earnings estimates was no help.  To be sure, even a decline such as this week\u2019s is barely notable in a stock chart that goes back more than a few months. The S&P 500 just had its best January since 1997, stocks from Nvidia to Boeing Co. to Vertex Pharmaceuticals all came close to doubling last year, and turbulence as measured by the average level of the VIX was never lower than it was in 2017. Friday\u2019s downdraft came on a day the Labor Department said U.S. employers added 200,000 jobs and unemployment held at a 17-year low.  \u201cThe underlying strength of the economy is still healthy. The overall level of interest rates is still quite low. If anything, we\u2019re surprised that it took so long for us to get a 3, 5 percent correction in the market,\u201d said Evan Brown, New York-based director of asset allocation on the investment solutions team at UBS Asset Management, which oversees $776 billion. \u201cThis is a healthy repricing of bonds and equities, and not a signal of something dire.\u201d  At the same time, a lot that looks straightforwardly good for investors could be framed as bad. Buying stocks when unemployment is this low and consumer confidence this high hasn\u2019t been a great bet: Four of the last five peaks in the S&P 500 came after the jobless rate fell to between 50 and 100 basis points below 4.5 percent, data compiled by Credit Suisse Group AG show.  The past year\u2019s rally has also attracted a category of investors whose enthusiasm isn\u2019t always welcome: individuals. Client activity at TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. hit a record as the number of daily trades surged almost 50 percent in the past year. At E*Trade Financial Corp., the number of trades from which a broker can generate revenue is the highest ever.  \u201cThe list of growing challenges have caught up to stocks,\u201d said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Weeden Capital Management LLC. \u201cWe probably need a valuation correction for both stocks and bonds to be more appropriately priced for an economy now growing at 3% real/5% nominal at full employment with rising labor costs and capital costs.\u201d", "stock": "NVDA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-02", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-02/stocks-in-rate-wringer-with-rout-raising-existential-questions"}, {"article": "Broadcom Ltd. is continuing to wage psychological warfare against Qualcomm Inc., but that may not win it a deal.  In response to Qualcomm raising its bid for NXP Semiconductors NV, Broadcom on Wednesday lowered its own offer for Qualcomm by $3 a share to $79. Broadcom justified the reduced price by lambasting Qualcomm's increased proposal for NXP as a \"transfer of value\" away from Qualcomm shareholders. It conveniently ignores the fact that the stock market transferred more value into NXP shares amid better-than-expected results and rising stock prices for its peers.  Topped Off Shares of semiconductor companies have soared since Qualcomm agreed to buy NXP, making its previous offer an effective cap on the share price Source: Bloomberg  This reads like a last-ditch effort to make Qualcomm management look bad and try to save face on a takeover proposal that has limited odds of succeeding. What's particularly telling is Broadcom's decision to leave the proposed reverse-termination fee at $8 billion. That likely wasn't enough for a deal between just Qualcomm and Broadcom. Mixing NXP into this amalgamation of companies -- which Broadcom is allegedly doing with the lower offer -- adds significant antitrust risks that shareholders aren't compensated for in this latest proposal.  Qualcomm investors are set to vote March 6 on Broadcom's proposed board slate. It's hard to see how they would be comfortable with this kind of regulatory risk. Odds are they don't hate the NXP deal as much as Broadcom does, either. Qualcomm shares climbed 6.3 percent when its talks with NXP were first reported and another 2.8 percent the day the deal was announced -- a rare feat for an acquirer.    Even at the raised price, Qualcomm says the merger should boost fiscal 2019 adjusted earnings per share by $1.50. Susquehanna International Group analyst Christopher Rolland estimates that may be more like $1.30-plus on more than $700 million of synergies. Either way, that's pretty good.  The NXP deal will diversify Qualcomm away from the slowing smartphone market and the licensing business that's given it so many legal headaches. As far as a backup plan to a Broadcom sale goes, the company could have done a lot worse. Obviously, Qualcomm investors would have preferred not having to raise the price for NXP, but they are smart enough to realize that the valuation case had moved against them and that feisty NXP shareholders like Elliott Management Corp. weren't going away. Those investors actually wanted more than what Qualcomm ended up giving them. At the very least, it seems unlikely Qualcomm holders are going to be cool with Broadcom assigning essentially negative value to a $46 billion acquisition.  That brings us to the delicate point in the deal machinations when it's time to consider Broadcom's future if it doesn't buy Qualcomm. Broadcom was doing well before all this drama, thanks in part to CEO Hock Tan's iconoclastic view of how to run a computer chip business. He hasn't skimped on research and development costs, but has chosen to focus on a few areas of expertise, rather than splurge to diversify into new areas. It's a more financially minded point of view than is typical in the chip industry, which has tended to be led by engineers.  Finding the Future Broadcom's spending on research and development is in the same range as Intel and Nvidia Source: Bloomberg  But the other essential part of Tan's playbook -- using acquisitions to grow the business and generate cost-cutting opportunities -- may be harder to achieve should this Qualcomm pursuit fail. After a multiyear spree of dealmaking both by Tan and the wider chip industry, he risks running out of appealing targets that are large enough to move the needle. It's the same problem that's bedeviled fellow famed cost-cutter 3G Capital, the Brazilian investment firm that backs Kraft Heinz Co. and Burger King.  Should Broadcom lose its battle for Qualcomm, it wouldn't be terribly surprising to see it try again at a later date. Tan has done a good job of zeroing in on investors' frustrations with Qualcomm's current management team and its legally challenged licensing business. If we fast forward a few years and Qualcomm is still going around in circles with its licensing business, or fails in some other way to meet its ambitious earnings targets, Broadcom will have even more leverage with shareholders. But in the current round of fighting, its latest move doesn't offer them much of an enticement.

Both don't have any fundamental technology that's crucial to their business, let alone something they stole from offshore.  What they do have is innovation, flexibility and the ability to develop new products at great speed whenever they spot a market opportunity. That's why they've become China's biggest companies by market value, at $532 billion for Tencent and $465 billion for Alibaba.  The pair's business models are also incredibly different. Alibaba gets most of its money from advertising, not e-commerce, whereas Tencent's WeChat has only just started tapping the ad market.  Alipay and WeChat Pay are good examples of how they stand out. No Western company has achieved even a sliver of what these products have managed. Mobile payments are ubiquitous in China in a way that makes the U.S. look like it's stuck in the Stone Age.

Equate Jack Ma's empire to that of Amazon if you like, but first tell me about Amazon Pay. Tencent's version, meanwhile, came from WeChat, the most powerful communications tool in China. No company worldwide has come close to the depth and breadth of WeChat usage.  Exhibit A: WhatsApp. Bought by Facebook Inc. for $19 billion four years ago, Mark Zuckerberg has barely done anything with it. Don't blame Chinese censorship and protectionism for the fact that you can't book and pay for a doctor's appointment over WhatsApp.  Similar can be said not only for Alibaba but its affiliate Ant Financial, which has become a vehicle for money market investments, bill payments and loans. It's only recently there have been reports from the Wall Street Journal about Amazon considering offering checking accounts.  On hardware, people often accuse Chinese brands Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo and others of copying Apple Inc. That was once a valid observation. Xiaomi's business model is unique, though, and it has since gone on to develop its own designs based on technology developed and sold by U.S. companies.  It's also made a significant mark in India, which no Western smartphone company has managed. To complain that Chinese hardware vendors have the benefit of cheaper labor is a non-starter.

There's a reason Alibaba is buying an equity stake, but it's not that.  A mega IPO from the world's largest fintech unicorn? Don't bet on it.  Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. said Thursday it plans to acquire 33 percent of its affiliate Ant Financial in exchange for certain intellectual property rights. When the deal closes, the companies will end the profit-sharing arrangement by which Ant pays royalty and other fees equaling 37.5 percent of its pretax profit to Alibaba.  The news sparked speculation Alibaba may be planning to take Ant public. The owner of Alipay was last valued at $60 billion, making it the world's second-most-valuable startup after Uber Technologies Inc.  Not So Tiny Ant Financial is the world's second-largest unicorn after Uber, valued at $60 billion Source: Crunchbase  But a look at Ant's earnings doesn't make the case that it's ready for a share sale. In the quarter through Dec. 31, Alibaba received a payment of 193 million yuan ($31 million) from Ant, down from 2 billion yuan in the September period. That's a 90 percent drop. Alibaba said that subsidy payments to acquire new Alipay users were behind the decline.  Squashed Ant Financial's profit contribution to Alibaba tumbled in the December quarter Source: Alibaba company filings  The nagging question is why Alibaba is doing this now, when it's had the option to buy into Ant since 2014.  Ant's business is facing some challenges. My guess is Alibaba management can see this is a company that can't afford to be paying out 37.5 percent of pretax income in the form of a dividend. In taking an equity stake, it's lending a helping hand.  As I wrote in December, Ant must navigate an increasingly complex web of rules covering everything from micro loans to the billions of dollars of client money it holds in escrow. Regulators in China tend to leave flourishing sectors like fintech alone, until they don't -- then out comes the wooden paddle.  Until recently, micro lending was very lucrative. Ant's two micro-lending subsidiaries have over the past year packaged up thousands of consumer loans and sold them to institutional investors in the form of asset-backed securities. As a result, in the first nine months of 2017, one of the units, Jiebei, generated 5.3 billion yuan of operating profit on just 3.8 billion yuan of capital. According to Bernstein Research, consumer lending accounts for almost 20 percent of Ant's income.  Empire Building Ant's revenue streams span payments to consumer lending to insurance distribution Source: Bernstein Research  The milk in that cash cow turned sour in December, when Beijing said Ant couldn't issue ABS exceeding 2.3 times its total capital. Now, to grow its micro-lending business, Ant needs to inject cash. In mid-December, Ant raised Jiebei's registered capital to 12 billion yuan.  Other areas of Ant's empire are under pressure. Because of Alibaba's dominance in e-commerce, Ant holds billions of dollars of client money in escrow, on which it can earn substantial interest income. But 12 months ago, the People's Bank of China ruled that all third-party payment platforms must deposit 20 percent of those funds in non-interest-earning reserves at designated banks. That threshold may be raised to 50 percent this year. This easy money used to comprise about 17 percent of Ant's revenue.  Don't think I'm all down on this deal, however.  Were Ant to IPO, investors in Asia, and possibly beyond, would have a chance to buy into China's dominant mobile-payments provider. And while middle-class consumers may not want the cheap stuff on Alibaba's Taobao, no doubt we'll all be using Alipay one day for everything from train tickets in Hong Kong to taxis in Singapore and clothes shopping in Osaka.  U.S. investors have been advocating for years for an Ant IPO to unlock the so-called conglomerate discount. What they need is patience. Ant's financials may not be looking so rosy now but this is a company with huge potential. It could one day become even bigger than Alibaba itself. Now that would be a share sale worth waiting for.

The online bazaar now spends more on marketing than technology.  For all the talk of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. being a massive online bazaar, the Chinese behemoth once spent large sums of money on its technology.

Investors poring over the latest financials will salivate at the company raising its full-year revenue forecast, or finally swapping its profit-sharing agreement with Ant Financial for an actual equity stake. They're both important headline items, but they paper over a deeper change in Alibaba's strategy that could have a longer-term impact.  Desperate to keep the flywheel spinning, Alibaba's sales and marketing budget climbed 90 percent in the December quarter, more than twice the 42 percent growth rate for R&D.  Spinning While Alibaba's marketing spend rebounded, growth in its R&D budget has lagged Source: Alibaba, Bloomberg  This means that it now spends more money on pushing its offering than actually developing it.

Just a few months back, it trumpeted a massive boost for its self-proclaimed DAMO academy (discovery, adventure, momentum and outlook). I've already pointed out that this bold proclamation of huge R&D largess is a bit of a misnomer, though at least they care enough to bother with the pretense.  But marketing executives don't build AI, and ad spend doesn't produce technological breakthroughs -- in fact, it's often the other way around.  Alibaba is already China's king of e-commerce, yet there are plenty of Davids ready to slay this Goliath in both existing and new industry categories.

SoftBank's investment in Alibaba was so successful that Masayoshi Son would realize a $140 billion capital gain if he sold now. Could a similarly beautiful fledgling emerge from those Chinese nests?  Maybe not. Investors are starting to lose enthusiasm for some of what Alibaba and Tencent are buying, at least in the so-called \"new retail\" space.  Disappointed Better Life's shares tumbled after Tencent and its e-commerce partner JD.com bought strategic stakes. Source: Bloomberg  The latest example is Better Life Commercial Chain Share Co., with a market cap of $2.4 billion. This past weekend, the operator of supermarkets in China sold a 6 percent stake to Tencent in a 887 million-yuan ($141 million) transaction, and another 5 percent for 739 million yuan to Tencent's e-commerce partner JD.com Inc. Both deals were done at 17.11 yuan per share. But when Better Life resumed trading this week, its shares tumbled 8 percent in two days, against a broadly rising Shenzhen market.  The investor reaction when Alibaba bought 36 percent of Sun Art Retail Group Ltd. for $2.9 billion in November was muted, too.  Compare that with two years ago, when investors could hardly contain their excitement.  Suning.com Co., an electronics retailer, sold a 20 percent interest to Alibaba on Aug. 10, 2015, at 15.23 yuan per share -- a premium of only 5.8 percent to its average price the previous 20 trading days. That didn't stop Chinese investors pushing the stock up 40 percent in four days on speculation its backer would turn the store operator into a higher-margin, more valuable e-commerce proposition. Today, Suning is languishing at 12.37 yuan.  Perhaps people are finally realizing the tech giants may not have their affiliates' best interests at heart. Case in point: Last quarter, profits at Alibaba's \"equity investees\" (excluding Koubei Co., which helps people find restaurant deals) came in at only $105 million, not even 5 percent of the earnings at Jack Ma's flagship.  It may be that all Alibaba and Tencent want from their retail and logistics affiliates is data on shoppers and shippers. SmartKarma analyst Daniel Hellberg says that whether the startups perform well as financial investments \"is almost beside the point.\"  Indeed, stocks of Alibaba's own affiliates, including Alibaba Health Information Technology Ltd. and Alibaba Pictures Group, have underperformed the parent in the past year.

The deal implies an enterprise valuation of $9.5 billion for Ele.me, Alibaba said in a statement Monday, without saying how much it\u2019s paying. Alibaba and affiliate Ant Small and Micro Financial Services Group Co. already owned about 43 percent of the startup\u2019s voting shares. Alibaba paid all cash in the deal and has acquired all the shares formerly held by Baidu Inc., according to a person familiar with the matter.  Alibaba shares were down 2 percent to $179.88 at 10:17 a.m. in New York.  Ele.me -- which means \u201chungry yet?\u201d -- operates an army of delivery people on motorbikes across the country and is vying for supremacy in the local services industry with Meituan Dianping, a startup backed by Alibaba rival Tencent Holdings Ltd. The market is surging as people increasingly turn to their smartphones to order food, schedule beauty treatments and hire domestic helpers. It\u2019s also strategically important for Alibaba and Tencent as a means to promote their respective payment services.  \u201cAs one of the most frequently used applications, food delivery is the single most important entry point in the local services sector,\u201d Daniel Zhang, chief executive officer of Alibaba Group, said in an internal email to staff Monday. \u201cWe can already see that a vast, multi-dimensional local instant delivery network formed through a food delivery service will be an essential piece of the commerce infrastructure.\u201d  Bloomberg News reported in February on Alibaba\u2019s plans to buy out other investors in Ele.me. In a sign of the heated market, Meituan has become one of the most valuable startups in the world. The company is seeking to go public as soon as this year at a valuation of at least $60 billion, people familiar with the matter said last month.  Read more on Meituan and its plans for a $60 Billion IPO  The Ele.me deal is part of a broader foray by China\u2019s largest e-commerce company into logistics and brick-and-mortar assets. Alibaba is taking over longtime delivery affiliate Cainiao and putting money into warehouses. It has also made investments in traditional retailers, including department store chain Intime Retail Group Co. and China\u2019s largest operator of Walmart-style hypermarkets.  \"If the Ele.me distribution network is integrated with Cainiao it can become a more efficient asset and bring it to break-even quicker,\" said Kirk Boodry, an analyst with New Street Research.  Alibaba and Ant Financial were lagging behind Tencent and Meituan in terms of offline penetration, especially local services, said Counterpoint Research analyst Flora Tang.  \u201cOwnership of Ele.me is the fastest and most effective way for Alibaba to regain leadership position in this area to compete with Tencent,\u201d she said.  Baidu had ceded control of its own food-delivery unit to Ele.me last year as the startup and Meituan became the two biggest competitors in China\u2019s online food-delivery market.  Zhang Xuhao, Ele.me\u2019s founder, will become chairman of the company, while Wang Lei, vice president of Alibaba Group, will become chief executive officer of Ele.me, the company said.  Alibaba continues an expansion in e-commerce as it faces greater competition across Asia. Last month, the company said it would invest another $2 billion in Lazada Group SA to bolster its presence in Southeast Asia, where Amazon.com Inc. has launched in Singapore and Sea Ltd.\u2019s Shopee is expanding to win consumers.  The Ele.me deal may cut into profit margins in the short term, but Alibaba has demonstrated a willingness to make such acquisitions for gains in the future. It acquired the video service Youku Tudou and mapping provider AutoNavi, for example.  \"Whenever Alibaba have seen long-term upside they haven\u2019t been hesitant about buying something in,\" said Boodry.", "stock": "BABA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-04-02", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-02/alibaba-buys-ele-me-in-deal-that-implies-9-5b-enterprise-value"}, {"article": "Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is happy to help promote the inclusion of competitive video games as an Olympic sport, just as long as they aren\u2019t violent or gory.  China\u2019s biggest e-commerce company, which operates an esports business and is a sponsor of the Olympics Games through 2028, is pushing for soccer, car racing and other games to be endorsed as an official competitive sport, said Zhang Dazhong, chief executive officer of AliSports.  That move could bar some of the world\u2019s biggest titles from the Olympics, such as League of Legends and PlayerUnknown\u2019s Battlegrounds, which are both distributed by Alibaba\u2019s competitor Tencent Holdings Ltd. in China. Esports is becoming a big business, drawing spectators to huge arenas where competitors battle each other for prizes and glory. The industry is projected to reach $5 billion in annual revenue by 2020 from ticket sales, advertising, broadcast rights and merchandising, according to researcher Activate.  \u201cIn our communication with the Olympics committee, we\u2019ve come to have a better understanding of their values, which is to promote peace,\u201d Zhang said in a telephone interview. \u201cThat\u2019s why for the future development of esports, we will focus more on titles that are actually related to sports, instead of games that focus on violence and slaughter.\u201d  Alibaba, which is investing 300 million yuan ($47 million) in esports in the year through March, is hosting the World Electronic Sports Games this week, where the member of the International Olympic Committee will also attend to observe. The e-commerce giant teamed up with the Olympic Council of Asia to add esports to the 2017 Ashgabat Asian Indoor and Martial Arts Games and the 2018 Jakarta Asian Games.  Game producers will need to be willing to share their intellectual property for free at the events, and the titles need to have a large fan base, according to Zhang. Because of the fast-changing nature of online games, it would be best to review what titles to include and adjust the rules on an annual basis, instead of every four years, he said.  \u201cWe think as a third party esports organizer we\u2019re a better match for principles that the Olympics promotes, which is fairness,\u201d Zhang said, adding that Alibaba will boost its investment in its esports unit this year, without giving a specific amount. \u201cIf you\u2019re a games producer, you\u2019re suspected of only pushing your games for your own benefit.\u201d", "stock": "BABA", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-13", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-13/alibaba-endorses-esports-for-olympics-but-not-violent-games"}, {"article": "Tech startups are typically founded by young entrepreneurs with more passion than experience. This is as true in India as it is in Silicon Valley. Then there\u2019s Bigbasket, whose founders are veterans of the dotcom bust and mostly north of 50. Drawing on their successes and failures, they\u2019ve turned their six-year-old startup into India\u2019s biggest e-grocer and are taking on a host of competitors, including Amazon and brick-and-mortar chains operated by the nation\u2019s biggest conglomerates.  Bangalore-based Bigbasket delivers everyday cooking essentials like ghee (clarified butter), diced coconut and fragrant basmati rice, as well as 18,000 other items from bread to laundry detergent to eight million customers in 25 Indian cities. It\u2019s mostly targeting upwardly mobile young Indians keen to avoid traffic and the drudgery of supermarket runs. Last month, Bigbasket raised $300 million in an Alibaba-led round that valued the grocer at $950 million\u2014 just shy of unicorn status.  In a country where groceries account for half of the almost $1 trillion retail market, Bigbasket is using knowledge learned the hard way during the dotcom era (don\u2019t expand too quickly or use discounts to acquire shoppers) and latter-day innovation (putting vending machines inside apartment buildings; building a supply chain of competitively priced organic produce).  Founding members of Bigbasket. From left: VS Ramesh, Hari Menon, Vipul Parekh, Abhinay Choudhari and V.S. Sudhakar. Photographer: Samyukta Lakshmi/Bloomberg  \u201cWe want customers to get hooked, and make our service harder to replicate,\u201d says Hari Menon, 56, co-founder and chief executive officer. He, along with V.S. Sudhakar (58), Vipul Parekh (53), Abhinay Choudhari (47) and VS Ramesh (62), founded Bigbasket parent Supermarket Grocery Supplies Pvt, in December 2011 in a nondescript building in Bangalore\u2019s humming Indiranagar neighborhood.  Bigbasket's founders had their first brush with e-commerce back in 1999 when they started Fabmart.com to sell books, toys and groceries online. \u201cThose were the dial-up days, there were no payment gateways, and the internet user base was more hype than reality,\u201d recalls co-founder Sudhakar, standing in a Bigbasket warehouse where women shake soil from mounds of vegetables before packing them into ready-to-ship bundles. \u201cBack then, it\u2019d take 50 seconds for a page to download.\u201d  It didn\u2019t take the men long to realize that the world\u2014let alone India\u2014wasn\u2019t quite ready for online shopping, and they pivoted to physical stores under the name Fabmall. They soon merged with a brick & mortar grocery chain before getting acquired by another conglomerate. By 2006, the founders had sold out and begun angel investing.  In 2011, they were approached to regroup for an online grocery. Plenty of people told them to stay away from perishable produce in a country so obsessed with freshness that shoppers surreptitiously break okra tips and sink their fingernails into cucumbers. The founders pressed on all the same.  But their timing was propitious: smartphones were proliferating, broadband was becoming affordable, and online payments were in place. Even so, when they pitched the concept, venture firms kept bringing up Webvan, the Bay Area e-grocer that famously flamed out in 2001. The founders revised their pitch to make clear that enough had changed to make the venture viable, and eventually persuaded private equity investor Ascent Capital to put up $10 million.  Workers stock shelves at a Bigbasket warehouse in Bengaluru. Photographer: Samyukta Lakshmi/Bloomberg  Delivering fresh food is challenging everywhere, but India presents steeper obstacles. The country lacks a cooling infrastructure\u2014walk-in freezers, chill rooms, refrigerated trucks and so on. That precluded Bigbasket from buying produce directly from farms. So for the first year, every morning at 3:30, the founders visited a riotous wholesale fruits and vegetable market to buy produce, then picked up other items from a wholesaler. Eventually, Bigbasket put together its own refrigerated warehouses and a fleet of trucks. These moves let the company source the food more cheaply and eventually in 2016 led them to launch Express, a 90-minute delivery service for milk, eggs, bread and emergency supplies.  By investing in \u201cthe dysfunctional food and grocery supply chain,\u201d says Arvind Singhal, chairman of retail consultancy Technopak Advisors, \u201cBigbasket\u2019s managed to get a head start.\u201d  Still, there was a lot of competition, including LocalBanya, Sequoia-backed PepperTap and SoftBank-funded Grofers. (Of them, only Grofers is still standing.) To stay ahead, Bigbasket needed to invest in technology: web-connected, temperature-controlled trucks, GPS-traceable vans, inventory-optimizing algorithms. \u201cThe days of experimenting were over,\u201d says Parekh. \u201cWe needed to step on the pedal.\u201d This all cost money and by then venture firms were more willing to invest. Starting in the fall of 2014, Bigbasket began mopping up capital\u2014$35 million from Helion Venture Partners and Zodius Capital Advisors, $15 million from Bessemer Venture Partners, $150 million in a round led by Dubai-based Abraaj Group. By mid-2016, Bigbasket was in eight large Indian cities.  Then it was time to target smaller cities. To grab the attention of residents in burgs like Kanpur, Surat and Vijayawada, they recruited Bollywood star Shahrukh Khan as a spokesman. In one TV commercial, Khan lets shocked delivery boys in through the back door. When asked if he's the one who orders the groceries, Khan lowers his voice conspiratorially and says, \u201cThat's my role in the house.\u201d When they ask for his autograph, he says, \u201cYou'll be coming home every week from here on. We'll take a selfie next time.\u201d  Along the way, Bigbasket has constantly had to adapt to local conditions. Originally the company wanted one person to drive the trucks and carry the orders into homes. But the delivery boys (they\u2019re mostly male) didn\u2019t want to be seen as drivers because they\u2019re considered lower status in class-conscious India. So they had to hire one person for each job\u2014which turned out to be crucial because parking is scarce so the driver needs to circle the neighborhood. They also need backup workers on standby because delivery people and packers have a tendency to take time off to celebrate local cultural events. \u201cIf there\u2019s a festival, 30 delivery guys take off to their village and return after four days,\u201d Sudhakar says.  Workers bag and weigh bananas and red peppers. Photographer: Samyukta Lakshmi/Bloomberg  Attracting and keeping customers is a challenge for all e-commerce companies, and doubly so in India. Shopping habits vary widely from city to city and are deeply ingrained. So Bigbasket plies customers with samples: leafy greens in Mumbai, a rice called Sona Masoori in Bangalore. The company spent years figuring out how to achieve the ideal ripeness of bananas for its picky customers and devised exacting quality specifications for produce, including eight varieties of eggplant, and trained the sourcing team to meet them.  Customized software automatically guides drivers to their destinations, which the company says has helped it achieve a near-perfect on-time rate. Late deliveries earn customers a 10 percent discount. Missing items are refunded, plus 50 percent of whatever the item cost.  Seven hundred people handle customer complaints and answer 95 percent of calls within the third ring, Bigbasket says. Complaints range from missing items to delivery boys\u2019 hygiene. After getting one too many of these complaints, the founders mandated that their personnel wear clean shirts and open-toe sandals to suit the humid weather. \u201cA Bigbasket person visits a household an average 50 times a year so being presentable was supreme,\u201d Menon says.  A worker prepares a barcode sticker for a customer's order. Photographer: Samyukta Lakshmi/Bloomberg  Last year, the founders took stock of what they had achieved. Bigbasket was now in cities with a combined population of 150 million people, had good brand recall and was making money on each order. But, \u201cwe\u2019d barely scratched the surface of the cities we were already in,\u201d Menon says. \u201cIt was time to bring in a strategic partner.\u201d After initial conversations with Amazon, Walmart and others, the founders zeroed in on Alibaba, which runs a large online grocery business in China and has built its own delivery operations.  They\u2019re now preparing for the next phase of growth by plowing money into warehousing and delivery systems in the 25 cities to bring down delivery times to three hours. In two years, the plan is to double the range of products to 60,000 SKUs, and more than double the farmer base to 5,000, expand private label items and use Alibaba\u2019s muscle to source and import a range of merchandise to six times that of large-format supermarkets. \u201cA customer should be able to buy whatever he wants,\u201d Menon says.  Even as Amazon and local rival Flipkart push into groceries, Bigbasket\u2019s founders profess equanimity. Grocery is different from electronics or fashion and they\u2019re confident that strength in one category doesn\u2019t necessarily translate to another.Bigbasket is growing quickly and aims to double sales each year to hit $2 billion by 2020 to take the third spot in Indian retail. \u201cThey\u2019ve just gone past 100 meters in a 42-kilometer marathon,\u201d said Vishal Gupta, managing director of early investor Bessemer. \u201cThey have to hit the top spot and keep on running.\u201d", "stock": "BABA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-19", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-19/alibaba-backed-grocery-startup-battles-amazon-in-india"}, {"article": "Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. will invest another $2 billion in Lazada Group SA and install one of its most senior executives to run the business as it doubles its bet on Southeast Asia.

Morgan Stanley, Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. were among at least 10 banks that helped to make the so-called margin loan, which is guaranteed only by Softbank\u2019s Alibaba holding, said the people, who requested anonymity as the details aren\u2019t public. The deal won\u2019t be reflected in the Tokyo-based company\u2019s debt, which may help shield it from a ratings downgrade, and could help its plans to sell shares in a domestic subsidiary, the people said.  The participation of the world\u2019s biggest banks in the trade reflects their continued appetite for complex share-based trades linked to their most-prized clients even after banks lost more than $1 billion combined on a margin loan linked to Steinhoff International Holdings NV. The South African retailer has lost more than 90 percent of its market value following disclosures of accounting errors that dated back several years.  \u201cTo my knowledge, I would agree that $8 billion is the largest margin loan ever,\u201d said Bethany Knight, a former Deutsche Bank executive who now advises on equity derivatives at Riverside Risk Advisors LLC in New York. \u201cThere are only a handful of sizable margin loans due to the significant ownership stake needed in a large, liquid, public company.\u201d  SoftBank couldn\u2019t immediately be reached for comment. Shares in Alibaba fell 2.2 percent to $168.86 at 12.25 p.m. in New York.  BNP Paribas SA, Deutsche Bank AG, Nomura Holdings Inc., Societe Generale SA, UBS Group AG and ING Groep NV were among other lenders on the deal, the people said. Representatives for the banks either declined to comment or didn\u2019t return calls and emails.  The margin loan\u2019s interest rate is the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, plus about 150 basis points, or 1.5 percent, two of the people said. Softbank sold $2 billion of 10-year bonds last year that had a yield of 5.7 percent in London.  The margin loan may also remove an obstacle to the initial public offering of its domestic telecommunications unit SoftBank Corp., which had been used as collateral for its earlier debt, one of the people said. A successful IPO -- possible only after the division proves its independence by canceling debt guarantees -- could help the parent raise capital and relieve some of its debt burden, which reached 15.8 trillion yen ($147 billion) at the end of last year. A Tokyo listing could raise more than 2 trillion yen, people with knowledge of the matter said this year.  Masayoshi Son Photographer: Akio Kon/Bloomberg  Billionaire founder Masayoshi Son, who has said he aims for a listing within a year, is seeking to separate SoftBank\u2019s activities into investing and telecommunications arms as it branches out into businesses ranging from ride-hailing to insurance.  SoftBank Group\u2019s debt risk last month jumped to the highest in almost two years following a successful exchange of its dollar- and euro-denominated bonds for new securities, allowing the mobile-phone unit to release its loan guarantee. That swap eases the way for the IPO, prompting concern among bondholders that the unit\u2019s listing may reduce the amount of cash flow for the parent company.  In a margin loan, a borrower secures the debt by pledging an asset with the understanding that they\u2019d need to pay up if the value of the collateral declines. The lender can typically sell some of the collateral if the borrower is unable to provide the cash.

It wants to lead a round of funding that could value the Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.-backed company at $150 billion. The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg News reported on the deal Tuesday.  I assume Singapore's state investment firm expects significant upside on that. After leaving room for a profit at IPO and a public-trading bump, Temasek probably thinks Ant is worth at least $200 billion at listing, which means around $250 billion on public markets. That's a lot to ask.  In the final full year before its IPO, Alibaba generated $2.8 billion in net income attributable to ordinary shareholders. A survey of analysts came up with a valuation of $153 billion in March 2014, six months before the company's eventual debut. Alibaba closed on day one at $231 billion. Ant has produced a 13.2 billion yuan ($2.1 billion) profit over the past year, according to Bloomberg Gadfly calculations.  Steady On Ant Financial's profit has risen, but not steadily Source: Alibaba filings  Alibaba was able to grow into its valuation unimpeded, thanks to robust expansion of China's consumer sector and the rise of e-commerce. Three-and-a-half years later, it has a market cap of $454 billion. For Ant to follow the same trajectory it'll need to keep going deeper into the financial and personal lives of Chinese citizens, finding more ways to extract value in the form of commissions, fees or data.  Facebook Inc.'s Mark Zuckerberg was just schooled on the political risks of mishandling user information. And while China may view data privacy differently to the U.S., it would be a mistake to think the government takes a laissez-faire approach.  As fellow Gadfly Shuli Ren has pointed out, Ant faces numerous regulatory headwinds that cast doubt on the inevitability of any IPO. Competition, notably from Tencent Holdings Ltd., has also hurt, and contributed to a 90 percent drop in earnings in the December quarter after Ant spent big to lure new Alipay wallet users.  Unstable Ant Financial's earnings have been very up and down Source: Alibaba, Bloomberg Gadfly  Providing payments, credit scores and loans is also a more sensitive caper than selling toilet paper and televisions, which makes the very visible hand of the Chinese government one of Ant's biggest risks. There are several ways in which the People's Bank of China has rained on Ant's parade.  Even if Ant's profit rebounds, investors would be remiss to ignore these instabilities. Tencent provides stiffer competition to Ant than Alibaba ever faced as an e-commerce player in its pre-IPO days. And there are many other fintech firms ready to eat away at both giants.

Alibaba reported its earnings for its fiscal Q3 2018 (ended December 31, 2017), which showed that its revenue grew 56% year-over-year (YoY) to $12.8 billion, its highest ever. Its core commerce continues to be the bulk of its business, bringing in $11.3 billion in the quarter, which is up 57% YoY.  The huge revenue numbers are partially due to Alibaba's performance during Singles' Day, which set records itself.  Alibaba saw the gross merchandise value (GMV) that was handled through Alipay on its marketplaces reach $25.9 billion on Singles' Day, up 39% YoY. It credits much of the sales holiday's success to its logistics and payments capabilities, which helped process as many as 325,000 orders per second. This suggests that Alibaba's move to work with and upgrade approximately 600,000 smaller physical retailers for Singles' Day paid off. These locations served as delivery and storage locations for Alibaba, and were outfitted with technologies like facial-recognition payments, helping Alibaba handle the incredible level of consumer demand, and displaying the value that brick-and-mortar locations can have for Alibaba.

To be the first to know, please click here.  Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba upgraded the AI platform powering its Tmall Genie X1 smart speaker to include visual recognition capabilities, according to Ciol.  The AI platform, dubbed AliGenie 2.0, offers visual recognition capabilities via \"Genie FireEye,\" a new function in the Tmall Genie's mobile app. Consumers can attach their phones to a phone holder, called the \"Xholder,\" that's connected to the smart speaker, and then use their phone camera to scan items, which the device will recognize. It will then read aloud information associated with those items.  A robust AI platform with visual recognition capabilities could help Alibaba continue to grow its share of the global smart speaker market. Alibaba released the Tmall Genie X1 exclusively for the Chinese market in July 2017. It then captured 2.6% of the global smart speaker market in Q4 2017, making it the third-largest smart speaker vendor after Amazon and Google in terms of shipments, according to Strategy Analytics. The smart speaker is also the top-selling voice-controlled smart speaker in China, with 2 million units shipped since its release, and it's been connected to over 45 million smart home devices.  Bringing visual recognition to the Tmall Genie X1 is key to Alibaba's approach to the market. Alibaba is looking into retail, travel, and especially hospitality as areas for smart speaker growth, while its competitors are primarily focused on securing a place in the home for their smart speakers. With the new visual function, the Tmall Genie X1 will be able to scan and read over 40,000 medicine boxes, which could be crucial for individuals with visual impairments.  The device will also be capable of scanning book covers, and can currently read aloud over 117 books by Chinese publishers. Additionally, the Tmall Genie X1 will be able to interact with consumers through more than 20 simulated animations and facial expressions, allowing its users to enjoy an immersive experience that includes voice, visual, and touch interaction. Alibaba reportedly plans to implement facial recognition capabilities in a separate rollout to make the speaker even more engaging.  The addition of visual recognition to smart speakers marks the next logical step for vendors looking to expand use cases. The creation of new and immersive experiences with the addition of visual functions presents new avenues for businesses to interact with consumers, and will likely boost user engagement as a result. Visual interactive elements can also help businesses leveraging smart speakers to find new monetization structures, like visual-based advertisements and app subscriptions that are based on higher quality and more interactive experiences.", "stock": "BABA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-27", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/alibaba-adds-visual-recognition-to-its-smart-speaker-2018-3"}, {"article": "Ruben Sprich/Reuters  There's speculation that Alibaba is looking to buy out the remaining stake of Ele.me, its food delivery unit.

Watch Alibaba's stock price move in real time here.    With one deal, Alibaba could dominate the online food delivery market in China.  There are rumors the e-commerce giant is planning to acquire the remaining 68% stake of Ele.me, its food delivery unit, which will likely cost around $9.5 billion, according to a Jefferies note citing multiple media sources.  Alibaba's planned takeover could make it one side of a powerful duopoly in China. Ele.me makes up 50% of China's online food delivery market while rival Meituan controls 43.5%, according to Analysys International. The move puts Alibaba closer to cornering the Chinese online food delivery market.  China is the world's largest online grocery market, and it is projected to more than double its growth by 2020, according to IGD, an international grocery research organization. The industry delivered 80% year-over-year growth in 2017, wrote Jefferies' Karen Chan in a note.  China has seen online grocery growth soar because it has a higher population density, lower labor cost, a fragmented food and beverage market due to the higher number of small mom-and-pop shops with no logistics capacity, and a \"well-formed consumer habit\" thanks to subsidies, Chan said.  The acquisition of Ele.me could create synergies for Alibaba to move beyond food delivery, Chan added. It could help expand Alibaba's cross-channel traffic acquisition, Alipay's scale from loyal or high-frequency users, and \"strengthen\" its last-mile delivery under its \"New Retail\" initiatives, which the company hopes will further imbue brick-and-mortar stores with technology and e-commerce.

The talks were reportedly not CEO level, and they're not guaranteed to lead to any type of cooperation, but a potential partnership could hold a lot of value for both parties.  For Kroger, a partnership with Alibaba may help it revolutionize its e-commerce and in-store experiences. Alibaba has a number of technologies that would benefit Kroger if the partnership comes to fruition. And Kroger may have an interest in such innovations, as it recently embarked on its Restock Kroger initiative to improve its digital and omnichannel capabilities.  Alibaba has expertise in e-commerce, which means that it can both advise Kroger as it looks to revamp its digital offerings, and provide some of its algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI) to help Kroger better personalize its online shopping experience.  Brick-and-mortar has been a focus for Alibaba recently, and it's developed some in-store innovations that would be valuable to Kroger. Technology including in-store AI for recommendations, in-store data analytics, automated grocery delivery help, and more could all help Kroger's in-store operations and improve its performance.  Working with Kroger could give Alibaba the ability to sell more American goods or gain data on the US market. If the potential partnership results in Kroger selling products through Alibaba's marketplace in China, Alibaba would be offering more US goods to Chinese consumers, who are very interested in them, likely bringing in new sales. But if a deal sees Alibaba working with Kroger in the US-based retailer's stores, Alibaba would be able to collect data on US consumers, a market it's shown an interest in.  Regardless of whether they ink a deal, this meeting displays Alibaba's interest in expanding its relationship with US retailers and potentially entering the market.Previously, Alibaba has been building its relationships with US merchants, and even hosted a conference in Detroit to launch an initiative to help them sell to Chinese consumers. Meeting with Kroger may mean that Alibaba is looking to bring more retailers to its marketplace to get more cross-border sales, or it could be building up its partners to make an entrance into the US market. Working with Kroger would be a significant step in both directions.  Jonathan Camhi, research analyst for BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has laid out the case for why retailers must transition to an omnichannel fulfillment model, and the challenges complicating that transition for most companies. This omnichannel fulfillment report also detail the benefits and difficulties involved with specific omnichannel fulfillment services like click-and-collect, ship-to-store, and ship-from-store, providing examples of retailers that have experienced success and struggles with these methods. Lastly, it walks through the steps retailers need to take to optimize omnichannel fulfillment for lower costs and faster delivery times.  Here are some of the key takeaways from the report:  Brick-and-mortar retailers must cut delivery times and costs to meet online shoppers' expectations of free and fast shipping.  Omnichannel fulfillment services can help retailers achieve that goal while also keeping their stores relevant.  However, few retailers have mastered these services, which has led to increasing shipping costs eating into their profit margins.  In order to optimize costs and realize the full benefits of these omnichannel services, retailers must undertake costly and time-consuming transformations of their logistics, inventory, and store systems and operations.

Fulfillment costs rose to 8 billion yuan ($1.2 billion) in Q4, a 45.7% YoY increase. JD.com ended the year operating 486 warehouses, a 90% YoY increase from 256 warehouses in 2016. To maintain momentum in 2018, JD Logistics, JD.com's logistics arm, which was made into its own business in April 2017, raised $2.5 billion from multiple investors in a funding round announced two weeks ago.

Marketing costs to compete on Singles' Day are rising.JD.com's marketing expenses grew to 4.7 billion yuan ($0.7 billion) in the fourth quarter, up 35% YoY. A major factor behind those rising costs was marketing for Singles' Day 2017, which paid off in the form of $19.1 billion in transaction volume for JD.com, more than 50% higher than a year earlier. The leading beneficiary of Singles' Day is Alibaba, which generated $25.3 billion in revenue on that day.  International growth plans are key to JD.com's success in 2018. Outside of China, JD.com's war against Alibaba is fiercest in Southeast Asia. The region is critical because it will see its internet economy grow to $200 billion by 2025, according to Google estimates cited by TechCrunch. In 2017, JD.com's investments in Southeast Asia expanded beyond its beachhead in Indonesia, for example, through large investments in e-commerce companies in Thailand and Vietnam.

Alibaba could be lobbying to get Kroger to accept Alipay, its online payment system.  Kroger could also be consulting with Alibaba about ways it can market and sell its products to Chinese consumers.  An outright acquisition would give Alibaba a physical-store footprint in the US that's about six times the size of Amazon's.  Alibaba could overtake Amazon's push into retail stores in one move.  The Chinese e-commerce giant is in talks with the supermarket chain Kroger about a potential partnership, a person with knowledge of the situation confirmed to Business Insider. This could take many forms:  Alibaba could be lobbying to get Kroger to accept Alipay, its online payment system. That would give Chinese tourists who are shopping in the US an easy way to check out at the nation's largest grocer.  Kroger could also be consulting with Alibaba about ways it can market and sell its products to Chinese consumers, like the warehouse chain Costco did in 2014.  Alibaba could outright acquire Kroger, which would give Alibaba access to the grocer's nearly 2,800 stores in the US.  A press release issued by the Chinese government last week and first noticed by the New York Post said Kroger and Alibaba were already working together.  \"Alibaba has teamed up with Kroger, Yintai, and RT-Mart to speed up the integration of online and offline sales,\" says the release on comments from an official with China's Ministry of Commerce.  The Post was also the first to report on the companies' discussions about forming an alliance.  An Alibaba spokesman said: \"Alibaba has dialogue with hundreds of businesses around the world every day about expanding commercial relationships and reaching Chinese consumers, and Kroger is an example of just that.\"  Kroger declined to comment.  Amazon shook up the grocery industry last year when it purchased Whole Foods for $13.7 billion. The deal represented Amazon's biggest commitment yet to physical retail, as the purchase included Whole Foods' nearly 500 stores.  A deal with Kroger could give Alibaba access to Kroger's nearly 2,800 US stores, the country's biggest network of traditional grocery stores, creating a physical-store footprint about six times the size of Amazon's.  'Kryptonite to Amazon Whole Foods and Walmart/Jet.com'  Kroger says it plans to add digital-shelf technology to nearly 200 stores this year. Kroger  Brittain Ladd, a Kroger consultant, wrote about the possibility of a Kroger-Alibaba partnership in a LinkedIn post published in June.  \"I believe Alibaba should acquire Kroger as a way to enter the USA, as well as extend and complement their global retail ecosystem,\" he wrote. \"A combined Kroger and Alibaba would prove to be Kryptonite to Amazon Whole Foods and Walmart/Jet.com, while adding substantial value to Kroger customers.\"  In the LinkedIn post, Ladd suggested that Kroger could license Alipay or launch Alibaba's Hema supermarkets in the US. Hema markets are similar to Amazon's cashier-less Amazon Go stores.  Kroger has been working on adding more digital features to its stores. The grocery chain is rolling out a new service called Scan, Bag, Go to 400 stores. It's designed to enable shoppers to scan their groceries with mobile phones or other handheld devices while they shop.  Eventually, Kroger says, the technology will also allow customers to pay for the items with their phones \u2014 which is where Alipay could come in.

Gideon Mendel/Corbis via Getty Images  Taobao, the Alibaba-backed online retailer, has launched a customized version of its app for elderly users.  China has 255 million people aged over 60, a largely untapped market potentially worth billions in revenue.  The company recently began recruiting for two elderly workers to improve its app for older users.  Nestle, IBM, and Apple have all begun targeting older consumers in China and Japan.  While most companies are still figuring out how to capture the millennial market, Taobao, the Alibaba-backed online retailer, has its focus set on China's growing population of senior citizens.  Last week the company launched an \"elderly-friendly\" version of its app that the company hopes will capture the attention of aging Chinese. There are currently 222 million people aged over 60 in China and, by 2020, that number is expected to hit 255 million\u2014 almost 20% of the country's population.  To gain access to this growing consumer base,Taobao's customized app is designed to be easier for older shoppers to use and can link straight to their children's account who have the \"pay-for-me\" option if they are inclined to cover their parents' purchase costs.  The customized app also displays a photo of their child on every page so users can easily share products or start a conversation via phone or text. Italso has a larger, less crowded interface, and uses more shortcuts for navigation.  \"By launching this simple and user-friendly option for the Taobao App, we will make online shopping easier for our senior citizens and help them stay connected with the younger generation and the community,\" said Ding Jian, Senior Product Manager at Taobao, who heads the development of this new channel, said in a statement emailed to Business Insider.  It's a sound financial move by Alibaba.  Last year, according to Taobao, shoppers over age 50 in China bought, on average, 44 products spending nearly $800 shopping online. Accounting for just senior citizens over 60 puts a possible total spend at around $200 billion a year.  Currently, Taobao has just 6 million users aged 60 to 69.Last month it began recruiting for two employees aged 60 or over who will work to get feedback from elderly users to improve the customized app.  But the company isn't alone in trying to tap the \"silver economy.\"  After Nestle previously launched a milk line for Chinese drinkers over age 50 and in Japan, where senior citizens account for more than a quarter of the population, Apple and IBM developed a modified iPad for the elderly which also had larger text, simpler interfaces and a modified FaceTime to easily speak to family.", "stock": "BABA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-06", "source": "business-insider", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/alibaba-targets-senior-citizen-consumers-2018-2"}, {"article": "DUBAI \u2014 A Dubai-based cryptocurrency company called Alibabacoin Foundation has rebuffed allegations of trademark infringement brought against it by the giant Chinese online retailer Alibaba Group Holding in a U.S. lawsuit last week.

As businesses and governments around the world look for ways to skirt the traditional news media, The Post has become a test case for how a new owner can co-opt an established brand to promote certain viewpoints. Alibaba executives say they want to present a \u201cfair and balanced\u201d alternative to foreign media, a mission statement that echoes Fox News.  Gary Liu, a Harvard-educated technology entrepreneur who is The Post\u2019s chief executive, said the newspaper could offer a more nuanced portrait of China than Western news outlets, with a staff of 350 journalists in Asia, including about 40 in the mainland.  \u201cWe are not here, certainly, to promote the views and wishes of Beijing,\u201d said Mr. Liu, who was previously chief executive of Digg, a news aggregation site in New York.

Last year, The Post retracted a business column that suggested an investor in Hong Kong had ties to a trusted adviser to President Xi Jinping and had used his connections to amass wealth. The editors said the column made \u201cinsinuations beyond the facts.\u201d  Its author, Shirley Yam, a well-respected financial commentator, resigned. In a statement, Ms. Yam defended her column, saying that editors had vetted the piece extensively before its publication.

The Post\u2019s leaders say that Alibaba executives, who have offices a few floors above the newsroom, are not involved in editorial decisions. But Mr. Tsai, the co-founder who spoke at the celebration last month, maintains a close connection, offering occasional feedback on coverage and new products.

Articles mentioning Alibaba reached an average of about 3.5 per day last year online and in print, roughly double the number in 2016, according to an archival search.  Alibaba appears to be willing to lose money on The Post, which is not profitable, according to newsroom leaders. Mr. Tsai has said The Post, with a circulation of about 101,000 and more than 10 million monthly active users on its website, may not become a self-sustaining business for at least five more years.  Traffic to The Post\u2019s website has roughly tripled over the past year, the company said. Alibaba made access free when it took over.  But Alibaba has abandoned ambitions of expanding the audience for The Post\u2019s journalism in the mainland, where its website is blocked. Even with its pro-China mission, articles in The Post still touch on topics that are off limits to mainland readers, like the 1989 Tiananmen massacre.

But on the front lines, reporters are grappling with perceptions that the paper is another Chinese state news media outlet.

Among their goals: building diagnostic tools that will make doctors more efficient.  Amazon and its partners, JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway, see technology as a way to provide simplified, affordable medical services. Although the alliance is still in the early stages, it could create online services for medical advice or use its overall heft to negotiate for lower drug prices.  \u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that across the board, the Chinese tech companies have all embraced being involved in and being active in the health care space, unlike the U.S., where some of them have and some have not,\u201d said Laura Nelson Carney, an Asia-Pacific health care analyst at Bernstein Research.  Photo  \u201cFew of them have made moves as big as in China,\u201d Ms. Carney said, referring to Alibaba and Tencent\u2019s American rivals.  Those big moves have had varying degrees of success.  In 2014, Alibaba announced a \u201cfuture hospital\u201d plan intended to make treatment more efficient by allowing patients to consult with doctors online and order drugs via the internet. But two years later, Chinese regulators stopped the sale of over-the-counter drugs on Tmall, Alibaba\u2019s e-commerce website. They also suspended a drug-monitoring system that the company had created. And last year, the search engine company Baidu scrapped its internet health care service, which allowed patients to book doctors appointments through an app, in a bid to focus solely on A.I.  But some of the more recent initiatives have made inroads. Last year, Alibaba\u2019s health unit introduced A.I. software that can help interpret CT scans and an A.I. medical lab to help doctors make diagnoses. About a month later, Tencent unveiled Miying, a medical imaging program that helps doctors detect early signs of cancer, in the southwestern region of Guangxi. It is now used in nearly 100 hospitals across China.  Tencent has also invested in WeDoctor Group, which has opened its own take on Alibaba\u2019s \u201cfuture hospital\u201d in northwestern China. The service allows patients to video chat with doctors and fill their prescriptions online.

Dr. Yu Weihong, an ophthalmologist at Peking Union Medical College Hospital, said she used to take up to two days to analyze a patient\u2019s eyes by scrutinizing grainy images before discussing her findings with colleagues and writing up a report. Artificial intelligence software currently being tested by the hospital helps her do all that dramatically faster.

The software has been developed by VoxelCloud, a start-up has raised about $28.5 million from companies including Tencent and the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Sequoia Capital. It specializes in automated medical image analysis, helping eye doctors like Dr. Yu screen patients for diabetic retinopathy, the leading cause of blindness among China\u2019s working-age population.  There are just 20 eye doctors for every million people here, a third of the proportion in the United States. In April, Beijing announced an ambitious plan for the country\u2019s 110 million diabetics to undergo eye tests.  \u201cIt\u2019s impossible for one person to read that many images,\u201d said Dr. Yu.  Ding Xiaowei, whose grandparents were doctors, founded VoxelCloud in 2016, three months after completing his doctorate in computer science at U.C.L.A. The company, which has offices in Los Angeles and the Chinese cities of Shanghai and Suzhou, is awaiting the green light from China\u2019s version of the F.D.A. for five diagnostic tools for CT scans and retina disease.  Photo  The sheer size of China\u2019s population \u2014 nearly 1.4 billion people who could provide a vast number of images to feed into their systems \u2014 provides a potential advantage for the development of artificial intelligence. Also helping: China has fewer concerns about privacy, allowing for easier collection of data that could result in smarter and more efficient A.I. systems. Regulation here isn\u2019t as strict as in the United States, either.  In all, more than 130 companies are applying A.I. in ways that could increase the efficiency of China\u2019s health care system, according to Yiou Intelligence, an industry consultancy based in Beijing. They range from behemoths like Alibaba and Tencent to domestic champions iFlyTek, which invented a robot that passed a Chinese medical licensing exam, and an array of smaller start-ups.  Money is flowing in. As of last August, venture capitalists such as Sequoia and Matrix Partners had invested at least $2.7 billion in such businesses, according to Yiou. Analysts at Bernstein estimated that spending in China\u2019s health tech industry will reach $150 billion by 2020.  Behind this push is a realization that the country\u2019s health care system is in crisis. With no functioning primary care system, patients flock to hospitals in major cities, sometimes camping out overnight just to get treatment for a fever. Doctors are overworked, and reports of stabbings and assaults by frustrated patients and their relatives are not uncommon.

Yitu is working with Zhejiang Provincial People\u2019s Hospital, the best medical facility in eastern Zhejiang province, to develop software that automates the identification of early stages of lung cancer.  While it initially focused on facial recognition, Yitu has branched out into more complex image-recognition challenges, like cancer scans. Lin Chenxi, who left Alibaba to establish the company in 2012, said he hoped to use the technology to ensure equal access to medical treatment across China.  \u201cIn China, medical resources are very scarce and unequally distributed so that the top resources are concentrated in provincial capitals,\u201d he said. \u201cWith this system, if it can be used at hospitals in rural cities, then it will make the medical experience much better.\u201d  Trying to identify cancer nodes \u2014 shifting black-and-white splotches that look something like a Rorschach test \u2014 is grueling work, and China\u2019s doctors have far less time and resources than their counterparts in the United States and elsewhere. Gong Xiangyang, the head of the hospital\u2019s radiology department, likened the process to a factory, where burnout and mistakes from overwork can happen.  \u201cWe have to deal with a vast amount of medical images everyday,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we welcome technology if it can relieve the pressure while boosting efficiency and accuracy.\u201d", "stock": "BABA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-01-31", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/31/technology/amazon-china-health-care-ai.html"}, {"article": "Alibaba and Data  E-commerce was both an aspiration and a boogeyman. Amazon was often described in hushed tones; several exhibitors and speakers tried to avoid naming the online retailer at all.  But attendees packed a large hall on Tuesday to listen to an executive of Alibaba, a Chinese giant that many consider to be Amazon\u2019s chief rival, describe how Asian consumers are eager to make purchases enabled by technology.  China \u201cmay well become the first cashless society in the future,\u201d said Lee McCabe, vice president of Alibaba\u2019s North America operations. Shoppers in China largely accept Alibaba\u2019s voracious data collection, which allows the company to create detailed behavioral profiles across its many platforms.  Alibaba uses the information to help guide American brands like Mattel into China, Mr. McCabe said. To promote movies like \u201cA Dog\u2019s Purpose\u201d to an Asian audience, Alibaba \u201ctargeted everybody who likes Dennis Quaid movies, who likes dogs, who has watched a dog video\u201d using its vast trove of data, he said.  Artificial intelligence also plays heavily into Alibaba\u2019s strategy and is used to predict supply chain volatility and personalize marketing. It also handles 95 percent of the inquiries the company receives from its customers. The system recognizes when shoppers become emotional and should be transferred to a human representative, Mr. McCabe said.  Certain consumers will soon be able to test-drive or purchase vehicles without any human contact, using their mobile phones at a garage that doubles as a vending machine, he said. Alibaba will have reviewed their credit scores and deemed them able to afford a car.

All retailers, however, are grappling with an existential debate over what constitutes a store, according to the panel. Is it a marketing platform? A place to buy goods?  Many companies are experimenting with new tactics, including showrooms and pickup services. Alex Taussig, a partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners, called this experimentation the \u201creplatforming of retail.\u201d  \u201cThis is all rethinking what it means to have a store, and this is why I think the retail apocalypse is not evenly distributed,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are certain formats that will go away.\u201d  Consumers in Control  Shoppers \u201cused to be passive individuals in front of a shelf,\u201d Laurence Haziot, a global managing director at IBM, said during another panel.

Sexual misconduct in the workplace can take a devastating human toll. Moreover, the issue implicates gender equality and gender diversity concerns more broadly, and boards that include a meaningful proportion of female directors should be better positioned to address sexual harassment and gender equality issues.

A scary U.S. inflation print in February sent shares sliding and raised fears of four, rather than three, interest rate rises in 2018. Since then though, inflation has failed to spook markets the same way; worries about trade and Big Tech regulation have instead come to the fore. Next week, with U.S. CPI data due, markets may find themselves back thinking about price rises and wondering if those February fears were justified.  There is no sign yet of those fears resurfacing. Latest jobs data showed the United States created the fewest jobs in six months, even if higher wage gains signalled tight labour markets. Bond markets' inflation expectations gauge -- 10-year inflation breakeven rates -- extended a recent drop.  CPI next week is expected to be up 0.2 percent, the same as its as-consensus rise in February. That could soothe volatile stocks -- if earnings hold up and trade tensions abate.

Next week's March trade data from China will probably show the economy extending its impressive run-up in exports: it's too early to see any impact from the tit-for-tat tariff salvos the Trump administration and Beijing have been firing off in recent days. China's Feb exports rose 44.5 percent versus year-ago levels -- well above the forecast 13.6 percent gain -- and another strong print may evoke fresh ire from Trump.  Global stocks have been volatile but on the whole, seem to believe all this is just noise. Discerning equity investors with shares in Chinese tech giants Baidu, Tencent or Alibaba also know the Sino-U.S. trade balance vastly overstates China's direct stake in those exports, which include components from Taiwan, Korea and elsewhere in Asia. Which means that U.S. tariffs on Chinese telecoms and electronics are negative for Asia as a whole.  In a worst-case scenario, trade wars may affect Japanese markets more than China if they boost the safe-haven yen and depress the Nikkei.

January's current account deficit was $7.096 billion, worse than forecast, highlighting how dependent Turkey is on foreign capital. Higher interest rates could help fix that by luring overseas flows and reducing inflation, which is in the double digits. But there are fears President Tayyip Erdogan -- a self-declared \"enemy\" of interest rates -- is escalating his campaign for lower borrowing costs.  The lira has already fallen 6 percent to the dollar this year and a bigger current account gap than expected could tip it lower still. The central bank has little firepower to support it. Its next rate-setting meeting on April 25 could become even more crucial after next week.

While bidders have emerged for the Panthers, several of them appear unwilling to pay far more than what they believe to be the fair price \u2014 around $2.3 billion, according to people with knowledge of the process.  So far, there are six bidders, according to a person with knowledge of the process, though only four are publicly known. David Tepper, the founder of the hedge fund Appaloosa Management and a minority owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers; Michael Rubin, the chairman of Fanatics, the sports merchandise company; and Ben Navarro, who owns Sherman Financial Group, an investment firm, have each made bids to buy the team. The three offers were between $2 billion and $2.2 billion, according to several people with knowledge of the bids who could not publicly discuss the auction.

Soon after Sports Illustrated published a report detailing those allegations, Richardson, 82, said he would sell the team.  Certain N.F.L. owners have already started to make their preferences known. Many owners have said that, all bids being equal, they prefer Tepper because he already owns a stake in the Steelers, which he would have to sell if he bought the Panthers, and because he has the financial wherewithal, with a net worth of roughly $11 billion.

Perhaps the greatest analytical error across the West has been the view that Xi Jinping would want to continue to sustain the liberal, international rules-based order once its economic power began to rival that of the United States. Again, this hope goes against the well-known facts: China has long said that it sees the existing order as one invented by the victors of the last world war, one in which China did not have a seat at the table.  China has never shared the West\u2019s view of human rights. It has long sought to weaken the powers of the United Nations Human Rights Commission. China has at best had an ambivalent attitude to free trade \u2014 just look at its qualified support for the World Trade Organization, its opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership and its own long history of mercantilism.  And as for the global security order, China has never changed its hostility to the global system of American military alliances, in particular those in the Asia Pacific, which it has long attacked as legacies of the Cold War. That\u2019s in addition to China\u2019s assertion of its territorial claims in the South China Sea.  For these reasons, Mr. Xi has explicitly called for \u201ca new type of great power relations,\u201d \u201ca new type of international system\u201d emerging out of the \u201ccurrent struggle for the international order\u201d and a new type of activist Chinese diplomacy that puts to bed Deng Xiaoping\u2019s dictum of \u201chide your strength, bide your time, and never take the lead.\u201d Hence its efforts to foster an alternative multilateral system with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Belt and Road Initiative.  Over time Mr. Xi would like to turn the page on the liberal Western order and write a new chapter in world history. If China in the next decade becomes the largest economy in the world with Mr. Xi still likely its leader, the country\u2019s economic success would be based on a form of state capitalism that rejects the notion that rising income parallels broader economic liberalization and political democracy.  None of us knows how much Mr. Xi will seek to apply the principles of this \u201cChina model\u201d to the wider international order. There will be tensions here. But we should be very clear about what Mr. Xi wants for China itself, rather than seeing it through the rose-colored glasses of the West, still shaped by the images of Deng Xiaoping\u2019s China, a quarter of a century ago.

A sign for Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. at the fourth World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, Zhejiang province, China, Dec. 3, 2017. Photo: aly song/Reuters  SHANGHAI\u2014Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. said it will acquire a 33% stake in its financial services affiliate Ant Financial Services Group, in a move that could signal that Ant is being readied for a public offering.  The Ant equity purchase was announced as Alibaba reported robust third-quarter earnings of 24.1 billion yuan ($3.82 billion), up from 17.9 billion yuan in the like quarter the previous year. That topped a forecast of 21.6 billion yuan by analysts polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence.  Revenue for the quarter increased 56% from the year-earlier period, to 83.0 billion yuan.  Ant, which was carved out in 2011 during the run-up to Alibaba\u2019s own IPO, runs the fast-growing Alipay mobile payment platform used by Chinese consumers to purchase goods and services, including items on Alibaba\u2019s online shopping sites.  Alibaba said it will acquire the Ant stake as part of a deal approved in 2014. In return, the ecommerce company would transfer intellectual property to Ant, with no cash impact to Alibaba.  The acquisition of the one-third stake in Ant would put Alibaba in a position to benefit if Ant were to go public, which has long been anticipated. Ant Financial was last valued at $60 billion in a 2016 financing round, and the company has grown significantly since then.  Scott Freeze, chief investment officer at Sabretooth Advisors in Pennsylvania, whose fund owns Alibaba stock, said the move suggests Alibaba is preparing its Ant affiliate for a public offering and wants to profit from the company\u2019s mobile payments business as it expands in India, Japan and Korea and other countries.  Alibaba shares were down about 3.8% in recent trade in New York. Mr. Freeze said the sell off was an overreaction to the news, as the stake would give Alibaba access to direct revenue from Ant and more authority over decision-making.  Alibaba\u2019s Chief Financial Officer Maggie Wu declined to comment on IPO speculation.  The companies said that following Alibaba\u2019s stake acquisition, they would terminate their current profit-sharing arrangement which entitles Alibaba to 37.5% of Ant\u2019s pre-tax profit, paid in the form of royalty and technology fees. There would be no cash impact to Alibaba.  Ant paid Alibaba $30 million in such fees in the three months to December, down sharply from amounts in recent quarters because Ant spent heavily to grow its Alipay user base.  Ant paid Alibaba a total of $735 million during the 2017 calendar year, implying that Ant\u2019s pre-tax profit last year was roughly $2 billion.  In a call with investors, Alibaba Vice Chairman Joe Tsai said the Ant stake would allow Alibaba to expand its role of providing value-added services such as mobile payments to upgrade traditional brick and mortar businesses.  The agreement would also give Alibaba more firepower to expand overseas, as payment methods are a key component of online retail, he said.  In its third-quarter report, Alibaba said revenue from its core ecommerce unit\u2014which runs China\u2019s two most popular online retail sites, Taobao and Tmall\u2014remained strong. Sales rose 57% to 73.2 billion yuan.  Alibaba is seeking to expand beyond online commerce into physical retail stores as well, expanding its chain of supermarkets and making a $2.9 billion investment in China\u2019s second-largest big-box retailer Sun Art Retail in the quarter.  Alibaba said its cloud-computing business revenue more than doubled to 3.6 billion yuan, as it attracted more paying customers and introduced more paying services.  Sales from Alibaba\u2019s digital-media and entertainment division, which includes mobile browser UCWeb, video-streaming site Youku Tudou and Alibaba Pictures Group , rose to 5.4 billion yuan. Analysts say intense competition in the digital-entertainment space will weigh on the company going forward, as Alibaba seeks to invest in more content to attract new viewers.  Alibaba\u2019s Youku video-streaming platform attracted about 374 million monthly active users as of Dec 2017, behind Baidu-backed iQiyi and Tencent Video, according to Quest Mobile figures.  \u2014Chuin-Wei Yap contributed to this story  Write to Liza Lin at Liza.Lin@wsj.com", "stock": "BABA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-01", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/alibaba-earnings-jump-35-1517488507"}, {"article": "Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, which with an affiliate currently owns 43% of food-delivery service Ele.me\u2014whose drivers here prepare for a morning shift in Beijing last September\u2014said Monday that it will buy the rest.

The investment announced Monday comes on top of the $2 billion the Chinese e-commerce giant has poured into Lazada since buying a majority stake in 2016.  Singapore-based Lazada operates online marketplaces in six Southeast Asian countries including Indonesia, selling everything from lipstick and car wax to instant coffee and smartphones.  Ms. Peng, a billionaire who helped found Alibaba in 1999, will replace Lazada founder Max Bittner as CEO. Ms. Peng is currently chairwoman of Lazada and will retain that role.

U.S. e-commerce behemoth Amazon.com Inc. launched its Prime Now fast delivery option in Singapore last July. Chinese online retailer JD.com and Tencent Holdings Ltd -backed Sea Holdings Ltd. also operate e-commerce platforms or have joint ventures in the region.

The market is expected to grow to $88.1 billion by 2025, the report forecast.  Alibaba owns about 83% of Lazada. The subsidiary helped Alibaba almost double its international commerce retail revenues to $727 million in the quarter ended Dec. 31, the company said in a statement in February, describing markets in the region as \u201cin the early innings of the game\u201d and pledging to continue investing there.

Wanda is now in business with China\u2019s two largest internet giants as it moves to shore up its balance sheet. The company struck an agreement in late January to sell a 34-billion-yuan stake in its property business, which mainly comprises shopping malls, to a group that included Chinese social-media titan Tencent Holdings Ltd.  Last year, Wanda came under fire from Beijing for its aggressive overseas deal-making, which curtailed the company\u2019s ability to pay for overseas acquisitions and repay debt. The company since has sold billions of dollars in assets both in China and abroad.  In a regulatory filing Monday, Mr. Wang\u2019s publicly listed cinema unit, Wanda Film Holding Co., said it would sell a stake of more than 12% to Alibaba and Cultural Investment Holdings Co. , a film company partly owned by the Beijing municipal government.  Alibaba will buy a 7.7% stake in Wanda Film for about 4.7 billion yuan, while Cultural Investment will take a stake of about 5% for 3.1 billion yuan, Wanda Film said.  Wanda Film said the deal with Alibaba was signed to strengthen their partnership in movie distribution, film investment, advertising and online ticket sales.  Alibaba\u2019s forays into entertainment has lagged Chinese rivals Tencent Holdings and Baidu Inc. Alibaba\u2019s film-production and digital-entertainment units also operate at a loss.

Alibaba founder Jack Ma, center, raises a ceremonial mallet before striking a bell during the company's IPO at the New York Stock Exchange. Photo: Mark Lennihan/Associated Press  Technology giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is working on a plan to list on a stock exchange in its home market, China, according to people familiar with the matter, more than three years after its blockbuster initial public offering in New York.  Alibaba is evaluating ways in which its shares could be traded by investors on the mainland, the people said. A secondary listing in China could happen as soon as this summer if the country\u2019s securities rules are changed to allow listings of foreign companies, one of the people added. While the bulk of Alibaba\u2019s business and operations are in China, the nearly 20-year-old company is incorporated in the Cayman Islands.  Chinese laws have long prohibited overseas companies from selling shares directly to local investors. China also currently forbids companies with shares that carry different voting rights to list on the mainland. Alibaba has a complex ownership structure that gives its founders and a small group of executives more control over the company than other shareholders.  The company in 2014 launched a $25 billion float on the New York Stock Exchange in what remains the world\u2019s largest IPO.  An Alibaba spokeswoman said the company has been considering a listing in China since 2014, if regulations would permit it.  Chinese authorities are trying to lure some of the country\u2019s technology stalwarts back to its capital markets. Alibaba\u2019s shares have climbed 86% over the past year and have more than doubled since their IPO, gains that investors in China have largely missed out on. The company now has a market capitalization of around $493 billion and is one of the world\u2019s most valuable technology firms.  In recent months, China\u2019s securities regulator has been in touch with several investment banks to discuss ways to allow companies listed abroad to issue securities on the mainland, the Journal previously reported.  Liu Shiyu, chairman of the Chinese securities regulator, recently confirmed the government has been working to win over overseas Chinese listings. \u201cYou will see results,\u201d he said on the sidelines of a legislative meeting in Beijing last week. \u201cA bit slower than the firms expect and a bit quicker than you expect,\u201d he added.  Noting that Chinese investors haven\u2019t been able to profit from the share gains of some foreign-listed companies that he didn\u2019t identify, Mr. Liu called it \u201ca pity, a real pity\u201d and said this \u201ccannot happen again.\u201d China\u2019s securities regulator didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment Thursday.  Some of the regulator\u2019s discussions with banks have revolved around the creation of financial instruments called depositary receipts, which represent interests in the shares of foreign-listed companies.  Enticing Chinese tech companies trading abroad, such as Alibaba, Baidu Inc. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. , to list at home has become a national priority in recent months.  Chinese regulators want large homegrown companies and promising startups to participate in its capital markets, giving retail investors an opportunity to tap into the wealth generated by successful companies, among other goals. Tencent, whose shares have also doubled over the past year, is listed in Hong Kong, while Baidu is listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market.  A dual listing on the mainland would give Chinese companies the option of raising money domestically in their local currency and help boost their profile at home, said Rocky Lee, managing partner of the Silicon Valley office of law firm King & Wood Mallesons. He added that well-known companies could potentially fetch higher valuations for their shares from local investors, because their brands and businesses are better known domestically.  However, China\u2019s stock market has historically had a reputation for being akin to a casino, and some analysts have said the listings of a few hot names could fuel speculation by Chinese individual investors, who dominate trading in the markets.  From the Archives Alibaba is China\u2019s largest e-commerce company but it does a lot more than just sell toys and clothes. The WSJ\u2019s Ken Brown explains how Alibaba\u2019s network of interconnected products and services have led them to become the biggest e-commerce company in China. (Originally Published May 4, 2014)  China\u2019s securities regulator is expected to announce plans for a depositary share regime in the coming months, said people familiar with discussions it has had recently.  Depositary receipts are a common feature of major stock markets in the U.S. and Europe. Dozens of Chinese companies that are listed on the NYSE or Nasdaq have American depositary receipt programs typically administered by large banks.  In the case of Baidu, every 10 American depositary shares represent an interest in one of the internet company\u2019s class A ordinary shares. Alibaba\u2019s New York-listed securities are also American depositary shares, with each representing one ordinary share.  Another tech company that is considering listing in China as well as overseas is smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp., people familiar with the matter previously told the Journal. The homegrown company is planning to raise at least $10 billion in an initial public offering later this year, and has picked Hong Kong as its main listing venue but is also considering a concurrent listing on the mainland at the behest of Chinese authorities, the people said. Xiaomi\u2019s parent company is also incorporated in the Cayman Islands, and to list in China it may also have to use a depositary receipt structure.  \u2014Chao Deng contributed to this article  Write to Julie Steinberg at julie.steinberg@wsj.com and Liza Lin at Liza.Lin@wsj.com", "stock": "BABA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-15", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-tech-titan-alibaba-plans-stock-market-homecoming-1521116131"}, {"article": "Lucy Peng will focus on running Lazada Group, an operator of online retail marketplaces in Southeast Asia that Alibaba invested $2 billion in.

Photo: Misha Friedman/Bloomberg News  Lucy Peng, one of China\u2019s richest businesswomen, is leaving the helm of one of the country\u2019s most valuable private companies.  Ms. Peng, 44 years old, stepped down as executive chairman of Ant Financial Services Group, the giant financial-technology affiliate of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA -2.21% that she led for eight years.  She is being replaced by Eric Jing, Ant\u2019s chief executive officer, who is taking on the additional chairman role with immediate effect, Ant said in a statement Monday. Mr. Jing, who is 45 years old, has been CEO since October 2016, when he took over the job from Ms. Peng.  Ant said Ms. Peng will focus on running Lazada Group, an operator of online retail marketplaces in Southeast Asia that Alibaba is using as a beachhead to expand in the region. Ant\u2019s statement said Lazada\u2019s growth is a key part of Alibaba\u2019s global strategy.  Ms. Peng, who is also one of Alibaba\u2019s co-founders, was named CEO of the Singapore-based company in March after Alibaba invested $2 billion in Lazada, adding to an earlier multibillion-dollar investment. She is also chairman of the company, in which Alibaba took a controlling stake in 2016.  Ant\u2019s management change comes as the company is raising as much as $5 billion from private investors, according to people familiar with the matter. The effort is widely seen as a prelude to an initial public offering of Ant, though there is no certainty the company will proceed with a listing in the near term. A spokesman for Ant declined to comment.  Hangzhou-based Ant\u2019s last announced fundraising round was in April 2016, when the company secured $4.5 billion from Chinese investors and earned a valuation of around $60 billion. Since then, the company has increased revenue, expanded its giant Alipay mobile-payments network, entered new markets and widened its scope of financial services for individuals and small businesses. It also has an asset-management business that oversees the world\u2019s largest money-market fund.  Ant\u2019s current fundraising effort includes local and foreign investors, who have subscribed to at least $3 billion of its shares, a person familiar with the matter said. Some market participants expect the latest share sale to give Ant a valuation of close to $100 billion.  Ms. Peng, who is famously media shy, has been a confidante of billionaire founder Jack Ma. She ran Alipay from 2010 to 2014, a period that spanned the business getting carved out from Alibaba and its rebranding as Ant. She went on to lead Ant as its CEO until 2016. Ms. Peng also became a billionaire after Alibaba\u2019s 2014 initial public offering.  \u201cShe definitely doesn\u2019t seek the limelight, but she gets on with it,\u201d said Duncan Clark, a former investment banker and chairman of tech consultancy BDA China, who wrote a book on Alibaba. Mr. Clark recalled that when some Ant staff pushed for transport and other perks similar to those provided by Western tech giants such as Apple or Google, Ms. Peng rebuffed them, telling her staff to focus on working hard. \u201cShe was very matter of fact,\u201d he added.  Before working at Ant, Ms. Peng held a longtime role as Alibaba\u2019s chief human-resources executive. She played an integral role in establishing Ant\u2019s corporate culture and overseeing the expansion of Alipay, which is used by more than 520 million people to pay for everything including groceries, movie tickets and utility bills.  Mr. Ma, in an internal email Monday, said that when Ms. Peng took the post of executive chairman of Lazada, \u201cLucy told me the time had come for Eric to take on even more responsibility and for her to step away and give Ant\u2019s leadership team the space to grow even faster.\u201d  Mr. Jing previously held other positions within Ant and Alipay, including chief operating officer, president and chief financial officer. He joined Alibaba in 2007 as a finance executive and started working at Alipay two years later.  Mr. Jing on Monday called Ms. Peng a mentor and said she was \u201cinstrumental in cultivating a world-class Ant Financial team\u201d that will stay true to its mission, according to Ant\u2019s statement.  Alibaba said in February that it would acquire about a one-third stake in Ant and end a profit-sharing agreement with the affiliate.

Founded in 2014, SenseTime is among a handful of Chinese AI startups that got their start selling facial-recognition systems to local police agencies. With a vast network of surveillance cameras, China is using facial recognition to identify criminal suspects as well as to influence behavior, such as discouraging jaywalking.  The technology also has commercial applications, with some companies now using it instead of badges to grant employees access to their workplaces. Mr. Xu said SenseTime would use the new funding to focus on expanding the technology\u2019s commercial applications and AI capabilities.  SenseTime is also developing algorithms for autonomous driving, as a partner with Honda Motor Co. , and is working with Shanghai\u2019s government to use AI to ease traffic congestion.  \u2014Dan Strumpf in Hong Kong contributed to this article.

The $522-billion Chinese firm said Thursday that its revenue last quarter grew 56% from a year ago to $12.8 billion\u2014the highest ever. The December quarter always has been big for Alibaba because of Singles\u2019 Day, an annual shopping bonanza in China on Nov. 11.  But part of the increase came from acquisitions as well as its big push into physical retail. This is the first quarter that Alibaba included revenue from Cainiao, its logistics subsidiary, after it increased its stake to 51% in October. It took private department store operator Intime last May. Alibaba also has opened 26 supermarkets, named Hema, in seven cities.  Stripping all those out, revenue would have grown only 41%\u2014still impressive but slower than usual over the past two years. Taking its toll last quarter: China\u2019s crackdown on internet finance and the expulsion of migrant workers in Beijing. Alibaba\u2019s aggressive expansion in physical retail also weighed on margins. Operating profit margin for its e-commerce segment shrank to 48% from 59% from a year earlier.  Alibaba also said it would acquire a 33% stake in Ant Financial, its affiliate that operates China\u2019s largest mobile payment system Alipay. This was expected, according to a 2014 agreement. It will, however, hurt Alibaba as it is receiving 37.5% of Ant\u2019s pretax profits as royalty and technology services fees. But such profit share fell last quarter because of Ant\u2019s aggressive spending to acquire new users. Faced with strong competition from Tencent, profit at Ant may continue to be under pressure.  While Alibaba is still growing fast, much of that has been priced in\u2014the stock trades at 42 times this year\u2019s expected GAAP earnings, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence, after doubling in the past year.

Spotify Technology SA\u2019s first day of trading wasn\u2019t as volatile as some market observers had feared\u2013although its stock price swung more than other big tech companies that took a conventional approach to going public.  After opening at 12:43 p.m. New York time, shares of Spotify traded as high as $169 and as low as $148.26 before closing at $149.01\u2013a trading range of 13.99%.

Other big IPOs have seen narrower day-one ranges. The trading range of Snap on its first day was 10.85%, while for Chinese technology giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. it was 10.84%. Snap\u2019s IPO took place last year, while Alibaba\u2019s was in 2014.  Spotify had \u201cfairly low volatility for the first day of trading for a technology IPO,\u201d said Cameron Stanfill, an analyst at PitchBook.  Spotify used an unusual maneuver called a direct listing to go public. The company warned investors that the process could result in greater volatility than a traditional IPO.  In a direct listing, a company simply floats its shares on the stock market. Unlike in a typical IPO, there is no underwriting bank to act as a \u201cstabilizing agent\u201d and prop up the company\u2019s share price if it tumbles out of the gate. There are also no underwriters to market the company\u2019s shares to big investors ahead of the listing, a process called \u201cbook-building\u201d that helps gauge demand in a standard IPO.  \u201cWith a direct listing, you\u2019re coming into the process with less certain supply and demand,\u201d said Joe Mecane, head of execution services at Citadel Securities.  As Spotify\u2019s designated market maker at the New York Stock Exchange, Citadel Securities oversaw the opening of trading in Spotify\u2019s shares, in consultation with one of the company\u2019s financial advisers, Morgan Stanley.  Still, it remains to be seen how Spotify performs over the next few days. One of the other quirks of the direct-listing process is that \u201clock-up\u201d restrictions\u2013which restrict sales of shares by insiders in a normal IPO\u2013are much looser in the case of Spotify.

BIDU -1.37% has filed for an initial public offering in the U.S., promoting its ability to use artificial intelligence and user data to deliver videos that generate billions of views.  In a U.S. regulatory filing, Baidu said it would list iQiyi on the Nasdaq exchange and is seeking to raise around $1.5 billion. Analysts at Jefferies have valued iQiyi at $17 billion.  The move comes as Baidu looks to raise money for the loss-making unit to stay ahead in the fiercely competitive video-streaming sector where tech titans Tencent Holdings Ltd. TCEHY -3.15% and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA -2.21% also have strong plays. Baidu told investors in its most recent earnings call that it would remain iQiyi\u2019s controlling shareholder.  IQiyi, which was founded in 2010 and will list under the ticker IQ, said it is China\u2019s largest video-streaming service by amount of time spent watching, with more than 50 million paid subscribers.  Two of its original series, \u201cThe Mystic Nine\u201d and \u201cBurning Ice,\u201d have together garnered more than 13 billion views, the company said in its filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  \u201cWe distinguish ourselves in the online entertainment industry by our leading technology platform powered by advanced AI, big data analytics and other core proprietary technologies,\u201d the company said in its filing. \u201cOur core proprietary technologies are critical to producing content that caters to user tastes, delivering superior entertainment experience to our users.\u201d  In China, people spend the majority of their online-entertainment time on video, and the market overall is expected to grow to 688 billion yuan ($109 billion) by 2022, up from about 51 billion yuan in 2012, iQiyi said, citing a report by iResearch Consulting Group.  But a tough competitive environment and the costs of providing content have made streaming a money-losing proposition for Baidu, as well as for its internet rivals Tencent and Alibaba.  \u201cWe incurred net losses since our inception,\u201d iQiyi said in its filing, including losses of 3.7 billion yuan in 2017.  Junwen Woo, a senior analyst at IHS Markit who tracks online video in Asia, said iQiyi has potential because of its use of AI, which helps the company differentiate from competing Chinese video platforms operated by much bigger rivals Alibaba and Tencent.  \u201cThey can know what is the most popular content and what are the most favorite things viewers like\u2014and what is coming up next,\u201d she said.

JD -1.97% is spending 34 billion yuan ($5.37 billion) for a 14% stake in Chinese billionaire Wang Jianlin\u2019s commercial-property company as he faces a deadline to relist the business in China.  Wanda, China\u2019s largest mall developer, is benefiting from an escalating war for consumers and data between Tencent and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA -2.21% , the country\u2019s two largest internet companies.  Alibaba has already established several partnerships with department-store and supermarket chains in China, and is seeking to integrate online retail with physical stores.  Tencent has invested in Alibaba\u2019s online shopping rival JD.com, and the deal announced Monday gives both a partner in China\u2019s shopping-mall business as they seek to blunt Alibaba\u2019s move into physical stores. The traditional stores are seen as a way to attract new customers and, for Tencent and Alibaba, as a means to expand their mobile payment platforms.  \u201cThe deal represents one of the world\u2019s largest single strategic investments between internet companies and brick-and-mortar commercial giants,\u201d parent company Dalian Wanda Group and the others said in a joint release. Other investors include electronics retailer Suning Commerce Group and fellow property developer Sunac Holdings Ltd.  This month, Tencent signed a partnership agreement with French retailer Carrefour S.A. and a local supermarket chain, agreeing to take a stake in Carrefour\u2019s Chinese entity. In Shanghai, it also is testing an unmanned pop-up store with consumers using mobile payments to complete the sale.  JD will invest 5 billion yuan into Wanda Commercial Properties Co., the company said in a regulatory filing. JD took part in the deal to create multichannel approaches to shopping, a JD spokesman said.  In announcing the investment, Wanda said the aim was to speed up the adoption of its \u201casset-light\u201d model that would allow it to earn income from managing properties instead of owning them.  Wanda Commercial raised 34.5 billion Hong Kong dollars ($4.34 billion) from private investors to delist the company\u2019s Hong Kong shares in 2016, in the biggest take-private deal on the city\u2019s exchange. Wanda\u2019s aim was to relist the company in China, where big appetite from retail investors helps companies fetch higher valuations.  Last year, Wanda came under fire from Beijing for its aggressive overseas deal-making, which curtailed the company\u2019s ability to pay for overseas acquisitions and repay debt. To shore up its balance sheet, the company since has sold billions of dollars in assets both in China and abroad. Wanda\u2019s Hong Kong-listed unit said Monday in a regulatory filing that it was selling two Australian real-estate projects as part of those efforts.  Wanda faced a September deadline to relist Wanda Commercial or repay investors in full plus interest of up to 10%, a person familiar with the transaction said.  The investors\u2019 stake, which collectively equals 14%, will be transferred to the new group and could clear a path for regulators to approve Wanda Commercial\u2019s relisting in Shanghai. The sale also represents a 22% premium over what investors originally paid to delist the stake.

The country\u2019s securities regulator has reached out to a number of state-owned investment banks to explore ways to let already-listed companies and private businesses issue shares on the mainland, according to investment bankers briefed on the discussions.  \u2018The government has a long-term plan to wean these companies off the U.S.\u2019 \u2014Paul Gillis, Peking University\u2019s Guanghua School of Management  One option being considered is to allow such companies to issue depositary receipts, so they can bypass Chinese law prohibiting firms incorporated overseas from going public on the mainland. The likes of Tencent and Alibaba are incorporated abroad in a special corporate structure so they can get around Chinese restrictions on foreigners investing in sectors like technology.  It is part of China\u2019s longer-term goal to turn the tide on years of the country\u2019s businesses going public overseas. Beijing would like to see more Chinese companies choose the mainland capital market as their primary listing destination eventually, the investment bankers said.  \u201cAt some point, it makes sense for Alibaba and Tencent to have their primary listings in China,\u201d said Paul Gillis, an accounting professor at Peking University\u2019s Guanghua School of Management. \u201cThe government has a long-term plan to wean these companies off the U.S.\u201d  \u201cThis would be a step in that direction,\u201d he said.  Tencent and Alibaba are already among the world\u2019s most valuable companies, and China has earmarked frontier technologies such as artificial intelligence as important growth drivers for the country\u2019s economy.  Shares in Hong Kong-listed Tencent\u2014the owner of China\u2019s most popular messaging app, WeChat\u2014more than doubled last year. In the process Tencent became the first Chinese technology company to crack the $500 billion valuation club, joining industry titans such as Facebook Inc. and Apple Inc.  NYSE-listed shares of Alibaba, China\u2019s largest e-commerce company, almost doubled last year. Alibaba now has a market capitalization of more than $460 billion.  In recent days, a number of tech companies said they are open to a China listing, though executives haven\u2019t gone into details. Tencent Chief Executive Pony Ma said the company would \u201cactively consider\u201d listing inside China. Baidu Inc. Chairman Robin Li said recently that the search-engine company has \u201calways wanted to come home to China.\u201d Richard Liu, chairman of Nasdaq-listed e-commerce company JD.com Inc., said \u201cif the authorities allow it, we are willing.\u201d The executives were speaking on the sidelines of China\u2019s annual legislative meetings, currently taking place in Beijing.  Chinese technology firms have in the past often opted for overseas listings, many in the U.S., for the prestige and to benefit from rules allowing dual-class share structures that give company owners more control over the business. The Chinese regulator\u2019s tough listing rules, such as the requirement for companies to be profitable for three years before listing, have also deterred high-growth technology firms from seeking direct share sales at home.  The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month that Chinese regulators have already approached smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp., which has plans to go public in Hong Kong. Investors say it would be sensible for China\u2019s technology companies to list at home, given the brand awareness they command there and the likelihood their shares would trade at high valuations.  Still, analysts have some concerns. Depending on how contracts are drawn up, Chinese individual investors buying depository receipts could lack full shareholder rights, they say. The listings of a few hot names could also fuel speculation by Chinese individual investors, who dominate trading on the mainland.  \u201cWhen the government is supporting something, everyone rushes in,\u201d said T.J. Wong, a professor of business administration and accounting at the University of Southern California\u2019s Marshall School of Business. \u201cWhat you don\u2019t want is a huge bubble, then a burst.\u201d  Chinese companies often have to wait years before getting approval from the market regulator to list their shares. The authorities would likely expedite this process for some tech firms, the investment bankers said.  Letting a number of top-quality companies issue shares on the mainland could help the Chinese market mature, analysts said. Beijing\u2019s goal, said one foreign banker, is to \u201ctake the winners.\u201d  It isn\u2019t clear when the regulator would formally invite specific companies into its market, given that changes to Chinese securities law would need high-level leadership approval.  \u2014Yoko Kubota contributed to this article.

These three companies\u2014the so-called BATs\u2014are plowing millions of dollars into electric-vehicle startups, car-sharing services and online retailers, as well as software platforms for autonomous driving and online car selling.  U.S. tech companies, notably Alphabet Inc. and its self-driving car unit Waymo, also are pushing into the auto sector. But the BAT companies have a big advantage in China, where tight government internet controls make it difficult for foreign enterprises to compete. For example, non-Chinese companies aren\u2019t allowed to operate digital mapping systems needed for autonomous driving.  BAT-Mobiles Chinese tech giants Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent have become major players in the auto business. Their interests span from electric-vehicle startups to smartcar software and online retail channels. Major BAT activities since 2013 Baidu Baidu Alibaba Alibaba Tencent Tencent Filter by Type All Partnership Software EV Ride-hailing Car-retail \u2014 TAP HOVER FOR DETAIL\u2014 Sources: Dealogic, staff reports  That has prompted both foreign and domestic auto companies like Ford Motor Co. , BMW AG , SAIC Motor Corp. and Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co. to seal tech partnerships with the BAT firms. This month, Renault SA said it is aiming for a fivefold increase in Chinese sales by 2023 as the result of a deal to sell cars on Alibaba\u2019s online retail platforms. Renault also said it would start using Alibaba\u2019s connectivity software in its cars in China.  The threat posed by China\u2019s internet giants was underscored when Li Shufu, the founder of Zhejiang Geely, announced last month that the company would invest $9 billion in a 9.7% stake in Mercedes-Benz parent Daimler AG .  \u201cThe competitors that challenge the global car industry in the 21st century technologically are not part of the automotive industry today,\u201d Mr. Li said in a statement. \u201cNo current car industry player will be able to win this battle against the invaders from outside independently.\u201d  Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent are betting that the auto industry is going to shift from selling hardware to selling services, with revenues derived mainly from selling subscriptions to features like shared autonomous vehicles and high-speed mobile internet.  \u201cThe BATs want people in cars using their online services. They see mobility as an on-ramp into their ecosystems,\u201d said Bill Russo, an ex-Chrysler executive who now runs Shanghai consultancy Automobility. \u201cSo they\u2019re all actively investing in mobility... This is a game that\u2019s not happening anywhere else. It\u2019s what makes China so unique.\u201d  Baidu Chief Executive Robin Li has made developing self-driving cars a priority for the search and mapping company. \u201cIn future commutes, you won\u2019t have to focus much on driving anymore,\u201d he said, on the sidelines of China\u2019s annual legislative session in Beijing this week. \u201cYou\u2019ll be able to have hot pot and sing karaoke on the ride.\u201d  Chen Hong, chairman of SAIC Motor, China\u2019s biggest car maker, speaking separately at the legislative session, acknowledged the tech giants\u2019 threat but said traditional auto makers have an edge in understanding drivers and their needs.  Still, these auto makers need partners. SAIC has launched an internet-connected car powered by AliOS, Alibaba\u2019s in-car operating system. Two big state-run car makers, Beijing Auto and Guangzhou Auto, are developing similar so-called smartcars with Baidu and Tencent respectively. Last year, Ford and BMW both said they, too, would launch smartcars using Alibaba\u2019s software.  The BATs are also generously bankrolling startups that are making smartcars slated to hit the China market later this year.  Alibaba-backed startup Xpeng Motor\u2019s new G3 SUV comes loaded with maps, music apps, Mandarin voice recognition and even a camera mounted on the roof, for buyers looking to post their travels on social media. Alibaba\u2019s technology and its knowledge of the consumer, accrued over nearly two decades as China\u2019s biggest e-commerce player, is helping Xpeng develop and grow quickly, said founder Xiaopeng He.  Traditional car makers need the BATs\u2019 strategic insights in a fast-changing marketplace, said Freeman Shen, whose electric-vehicle startup WM Motor is backed by Baidu and Tencent. Unless auto makers work with the BATs, said Mr. Shen, a former Geely executive, \u201cI don\u2019t think they can survive.\u201d  Baidu and Tencent are also investors in Shanghai-based NIO, whose debut electric vehicle has a voice-operated personal assistant, is able to park itself and comes loaded with apps provided by its two big tech backers.  The automobile is turning into a \u201cmobile living space,\u201d said NIO founder William Li. The passenger is a captive audience for internet services\u2014hence the BATs\u2019 interest in autos as potential channels for everything from online shopping to videogames to mobile TV.  All three companies have also invested in Didi Chuxing, China\u2019s answer to Uber. And Tencent, hedging its bets beyond China, last year bought 5% of Tesla Inc . for $1.78 billion.  For now, auto makers and tech companies can coexist by marrying car-making expertise with software innovation. \u201cWhen you put these two together you get a fantastic chemical reaction,\u201d said Simon Hu, who runs Alibaba\u2019s AliOS car operating-system division.  But as China\u2019s tech giants permeate the auto industry from all angles, the big question is: How much of the sector\u2019s revenues will they manage to commandeer? \u201cThe BATs have the bucks required to get into this game and stay in the game for however long it takes to win,\u201d said Michael Dunne, a Hong Kong-based auto consultant.  \u2014Yoko Kubota in Beijing contributed to this article.

A popular trade involves buying Altaba\u2019s stock and selling short Alibaba\u2019s\u2014and sometimes also Yahoo Japan\u2019s. It is a bet that the gap closes between Altaba\u2019s market value and those of its stakes in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan.", "stock": "BABA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-16", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/profitable-plans-afoot-to-carve-rump-of-yahoo-1521223516"}, {"article": "GUANGZHOU, China\u2014 Eric Zhou is interested in buying a Ford Kuga sport-utility vehicle. So last week, he picked up the car for a three-day test drive from a vending machine.  Mr. Zhou never visited a dealership or spoke to a salesperson. He booked the test drive online, then showed up at a service center where employees can identify would-be buyers using facial-recognition technology. His SUV was then delivered from the eight-story \u201cvending machine\u201d\u2014essentially an automated parking garage.  \u201cThis is so much more efficient and convenient than traditional dealerships,\u201d said Mr. Zhou, 38 years old.  It\u2019s the first of several such car-vending centers that Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. plans to open across China this year\u2014part of the company\u2019s latest effort to translate its success in online retailing to the physical shopping world.  Alibaba is betting on the experiment to succeed in China, where consumers have enthusiastically embraced the e-commerce economy. Mr. Zhou buys clothes, home appliances and even the construction materials needed for his recent home renovation without going into a traditional store.

Carvana, a used-car dealer in Phoenix, has been operating such structures since 2013. Customers can search for, purchase, finance and trade-in vehicles online, then have the option of picking it up from a giant vending machine filled with cars.  But the model hasn\u2019t taken off more broadly in the U.S., where many consumers prefer to negotiate a deal in person, and have the salesperson help them with tasks such as pairing their smartphone with a car\u2019s Bluetooth, said David Sullivan, a Michigan-based analyst with AutoPacific Inc.  China\u2019s automotive retail climate is different\u2014and ripe for disruption, analysts say.  China\u2019s consumers, often first-time car buyers, are more open to trying out new concepts, said Dean Stoneley, Ford\u2019s Asia Pacific vice president for marketing. Ford has seen sales in China decline sharply in recent months as domestic competitors become more popular. Ford is now searching for new ways to engage customers, as more and more go online to do their car-buying research, Mr. Stoneley said.  \u201cA car vending machine is the ultimate word in frictionless commerce\u2014you don\u2019t have to deal with salespeople trying to talk you into things you don\u2019t want, and you don\u2019t have to haggle over price,\u201d said Jessica Wolfe, a principal in the Consumer and Retail practice of A.T. Kearney, a consulting firm. \u201cYou can think for yourself, do the research, and make the purchase when you\u2019re ready on your phone. That\u2019s exactly how millennials like to transact.\u201d  At the vending center, attendants are available to explain a car\u2019s basic features and to answer questions. Ford said each car has contact details of local dealerships where customers can go with questions or problems.  China\u2019s internet giants are experimenting with bringing the principles of e-commerce into other corners of the physical retail world as well. Just as Amazon.com Inc. is experimenting with unmanned supermarkets, Chinese e-commerce companies are taking stakes in malls and supermarkets, digitizing such operations as they seek growth beyond their core online retail business. In some cases, they\u2019re aiming to use the vast troves of data they have gleaned from e-commerce to change the way consumers shop in the real world.  Alibaba is experimenting with using augmented reality mirrors and vending machines in malls to allow consumers to \u201cvirtually\u201d try on various lipstick colors and buy them on the spot through Alibaba\u2019s online platforms.  JD.com Inc., which made its name in online ordering and delivery, is also getting into brick and mortar with a chain of clerkless convenience stores where shoppers can pay using facial-recognition technology.  Under the auto vending-machine program rolled out by Alibaba last week, customers go to Alibaba\u2019s Tmall website to book the test drive, which is free for those with high scores on the Sesame Credit rating system by Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial Services Group. Without a high credit score, consumers have to fork out 99 yuan ($16) to test-drive selected Ford sedans and 198 yuan for other models including a Ford Mustang sports car.  Alibaba is currently offering only Ford models, but it is in talks with other foreign and domestic brands to expand the inventory, said Lu Huan, the marketing director for Tmall\u2019s automotive division.  China is the world's largest market for electric vehicles, thanks largely to subsidies that drive costs down. Those incentives will end by 2020, but the government is betting that won't be the end of the road for its electric dream.

In the first two days, Ford received 450 orders to test-drive the vehicle, Mr. Stoneley said. Ford declined to say if the new approach has resulted in any sales yet.  The vending machine helps to ease anxiety for potential car buyers, who are often tense when they enter a dealership expecting a hard sell, said James Chao, a Shanghai-based automotive consultant at IHS Markit.  Still, Mr. Chao said car brands face a challenge with this approach: Without a salesman, it may be tougher to convert a test drive to an actual sale, or to respond to customer feedback in the process.  \u201cWith extended test drives you don\u2019t have someone seated next to you, listening to your feedback and trying to overcome your objections,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons that the auto retail process has stayed the same in the last 30 years.\u201d  Write to Liza Lin at Liza.Lin@wsj.com", "stock": "BABA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-04-05", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/to-buy-a-car-in-china-hit-the-vending-machine-1522929642"}]
