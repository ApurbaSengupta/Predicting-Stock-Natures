[{"article": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google will put more of a premium on \u201cdiverse perspectives\u201d in its search results, saying in a blog post on Tuesday that answers highlighted at the top of result pages would soon display multiple viewpoints on topics for the first time ever.  FILE PHOTO: A Google search page is seen through a magnifying glass in this photo illustration taken in Berlin, August 11, 2015. REUTERS/Pawel Kopczynski/File Photo  The move comes as internet companies face increasing political pressure to rid their services of misleading or fake news, extremist content and hoaxes.  Google said it was also is considering new labeling so its users could see when a featured answer is an imperfect match based on a proximate question.  Other changes announced by Google last year were aimed at helping stem conspiracy theories and offensive information from making it into the highlighted results, which Google calls \u201cfeatured snippets.\u201d  Google typically plucks snippets from third-party websites and shows them in a large box before the traditional list of links in search results. Snippets are relied on by Google\u2019s virtual assistant to read out answers to searches conducted through smart speakers such as the Google Home.  The company introduced featured snippets four years ago to get people to desired information faster. But the feature has drawn scrutiny for highlighting inaccurate answers, with mishaps last year including snippets that said women were evil and that former U.S. President Barack Obama was planning a coup.  The latest changes address queries such as \u201care reptiles good pets,\u201d Danny Sullivan, Google\u2019s public liaison for search, wrote in the blog post.  Google tries to answer with information \u201cstrongly aligned\u201d with the search so a webpage contending reptiles are nice pets would likely be shown, Sullivan said. But users ultimately want to know how reptiles rate as pets one way or the other. The featured snippet for \u201care reptiles bad pets\u201d would be valuable too even if it contradicts the first snippet, he said.  If Google succeeds in delivering multiple viewpoints in one answer for other queries, it could help lead users away from potentially skewed results when looking up topics such as \u201cis the Earth flat\u201d and \u201care vaccines dangerous.\u201d  \u201cThere are often legitimate diverse perspectives offered by publishers, and we want to provide users visibility and access into those perspectives from multiple sources,\u201d Matthew Gray, Google\u2019s software engineer overseeing featured snippets, was quoted in the blog post as saying.  The display for multiple featured snippets and how they would be presented over voice search has not been determined, Google said.", "stock": "GOOGL", "label": -1, "date": "2018-01-31", "source": "reuters", "url": "https://in.reuters.com/article/alphabet-google/google-aims-to-get-diverse-perspectives-into-search-results-idINKBN1FK0D5"}, {"article": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc\u2019s (GOOGL.O) Google routinely fields product queries from millions of shoppers.

Yet Google almost pulled it off in just under seven years.  On March 5, nine-year-old restaurant guide Infatuation announced it was buying the Zagat brand for an undisclosed amount. The company\u2014best known for its #eeeeeats hashtag\u2014now controls the 35-year-old Zagat name and its international catalog of reviews.  For some, the question isn\u2019t why Google sold off Zagat; it\u2019s what took so long. The relationship between the two companies had been troubled for years. The 2011 purchase was championed by former Google executive Marissa Mayer, who saw Zagat as an asset for the maps division she controlled. But by 2013, some reviewers panned the release of the Zagat app, which had a difficult user interface and seemed designed to push content such as \u201cRose for Every Mood: What to Bring to Any Summer Occasion,\u201d rather than help people find a good place to eat.    Then, a few years ago, Google chose to infuse its mapping services with features such as user-generated restaurant reviews, rather than leveraging Zagat and its resources. It was a defensive move to ward off rivals such as Yelp Inc. and Apple Inc., which were then credible threats to Google\u2019s dominance in local information. Zagat, meanwhile, was left to wither.  The end of an era.  How did this happen? When Mayer departed in 2012, Zagat was left without a champion at Google, according to a former Zagat contractor who requested anonymity. Instead of hiring additional full-time staff, Google relied on contractors for content and assigned a minimal number of engineers for such major projects as the app launch and a 2017 web redesign, according to several people who worked for Zagat at the time. Gradually, the number of contractors working on Zagat content decreased\u2014there were just over a dozen to cover the globe\u2014and coverage of notable cities such as London and Toronto was suspended.  Google declined a request for comment.  Eventually, the staff was told to de-emphasize reviews, which were the backbone of the business. Instead, employees were directed to focus on boilerplate guide lists, such as \u201cBest Brunch\u201d and \u201cBest After Work Drinks.\u201d The changes left the remaining staff frustrated, according to the former contractor.  Tim and Nina Zagat founded their eponymous guide as a hobby in 1979. The couple, having met at Yale Law School, started the business after a guest criticized a newspaper\u2019s restaurant reviews at a dinner party. The Zagats began soliciting friends\u2019 opinions and found 200 amateur critics to rate 100 restaurants for food, d\u00e9cor, service, and costs. An empire was born. For years, the Zagat guide was part of the calculus of figuring out where you were going to eat.    Those days are long gone. By 2017, Zagat failed even to send out its annual survey\u2014the basis for its restaurant rankings. No guide was produced, and no explanation was given.  Flashback. Photographer: Paul Taggart  Zagat freelancers weren\u2019t notified of the Infatuation deal beforehand, according to a current contractor who requested anonymity. Instead, they were told on Friday night that security was being updated and that they would be locked out of Zagat tools, the contractor says. By Monday morning, they were given the press release.    Infatuation didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. In a statement, the site said it will operate Zagat as a separate brand, with a new, tech-driven platform that will be an alternative to other crowdsourced restaurant reviews.  In October, Google held its second Local Guides Summit in San Francisco. The program encourages users of the company\u2019s Maps app to upload photos and write reviews of places such as restaurants and to submit new locations. During the summit, Google announced that 50 million people were contributing to the program, a 1,000 percent increase from the 5 million it tracked in early 2016. More than 700,000 venues are being added to Maps each month, according to the company. Maps has more than 1 billion users, making it a lot more efficient and broader than Zagat\u2019s restaurant-review system.  \u201cI assume Google figured out that they didn\u2019t need the brand name in order to surface the information,\u201d said restaurateur Nick Kokonas, whose Alinea dining room topped the list in the 2012 Chicago Zagat guide. \u201cAt the end of the day, Google can get all that Zagat information without actually owning Zagat, right?\u201d  \u2014 With assistance by Mark Bergen", "stock": "GOOGL", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-07", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-07/here-s-how-google-almost-destroyed-zagat"}, {"article": "People are spending more time on Google products like YouTube than on Facebook #tictocnews  Facebook Inc. lost ground to Google in January as users spent more time on YouTube and other Alphabet Inc. properties, according to a report.  Brian Wieser, a Pivotal Research analyst who reviewed Nielsen digital consumption data, said Google properties, including YouTube and Waze, combined to account for 27.4 percent of all time spent on digital media -- up 3 percentage points from the previous year. By contrast, Facebook\u2019s share of time spent fell about 2 points to 16.3 percent over the same period.  Facebook depends on people coming back frequently so it can collect data and use it to target ads at them. The company said in the fourth quarter that people were spending less time on the site after Facebook began shifting users\u2019 news feeds back toward posts from friends and family and away from businesses and media outlets. But if the trend continues, investors could take it as a sign that users are losing interest in Facebook.  Nielsen published its Digital Content Ratings on Tuesday. YouTube accounts for half of all Google activity and continues to draw consumption well in excess of 20 percent year-over-year every month, Weiser said. Other Google properties expanded by 33 percent.  Facebook\u2019s main site lost 5 percent in time spent, despite a 4 percent increase in the number of users. That amounts to an 8 percent decline per person, Weiser said. Instagram, a Facebook property, did much better with a 7 percent increase in time per user.

Last week, Apple Inc. offered an olive branch to the media industry by buying Texture, a digital service that lets users subscribe to more than 200 magazines for $9.99 a month. Apple and Google are trying to seize on a moment when Facebook\u2019s ties with news outlets have soured.  The relationship between news providers and \u201cthe major digital platforms -- how they think about content, how they think about publishers, how they think about data -- feels more in flux right now than it has in a long time,\u201d Mark Thompson, chief executive officer of the New York Times Co., said in an interview.  The new financial terms are part of \u201cSubscribe with Google,\u201d a feature that gives media companies data and tools to find and keep subscribers. It was one of several announcements the search giant made in New York on Tuesday to appease publishers whose content helps Google sell advertising.  \"Our mission is inherently tied to your mission,\" Philipp Schindler, Google\u2019s chief business officer, told a room of media executives.  Subscriber Tool  When consumers sign up for a subscription using \u201cSubscribe with Google\u201d at a publisher\u2019s website, Google will keep just 5 percent of the revenue, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing nonpublic information. If they use the tool at the Google Play Store, that goes up to 15 percent.  On Tuesday, Google said it would share data to help identify potential paying readers and that users\u2019 search results would more prominently feature publications they subscribe to. The company also said it would dole out $300 million to support digital journalism globally over the next three years.  \u201cWe welcome the fact that Google has listened to and responded to some of our asks about our subscription business,\u201d Thompson said. He also said he\u2019d like to see Google and others share advertising revenue with publishers, since the tech companies make big profits by selling online ads around other providers\u2019 news content.  \u201cAny kind of comprehensive solution to do with sustaining quality journalism on these major platforms will have to consider the advertising side of the equation as well,\u201d Thompson said.  Boost Relations  Apple\u2019s purchase of Texture last week was that company\u2019s latest effort to boost relations with news outlets. Apple once touted the iPad as a potential savior for the industry, which has struggled for years with declining subscribers and print advertising. In 2011, News Corp. created an iPad-only newspaper called The Daily, but shut it down in less than two years after failing to find a big enough audience.  Conde Nast President Bob Sauerberg said he\u2019s optimistic Apple\u2019s acquisition will start a new chapter that will benefit his stable of glossy magazines, which include Wired and The New Yorker. Conde Nast was a co-owner of Texture.  \u201cThey have big ambitions,\u201d Sauerberg said.  Sauerberg said not all tech giants have put publishers at the top of their priority lists, but for now, \u201cI feel really good we\u2019re at the top of the list for Apple and for Google.\u201d  IPhone App  Apple\u2019s focus with publishers has been on distributing their stories on Apple News, an app that comes installed on millions of iPhones. Media executives say Apple News could be a significant source of online readership. But so far they\u2019ve seen little money from it.  Apple News is a way to attract more Times readers, especially outside the U.S., \u201cbut without significant economics attached,\u201d Thompson said. The Times distributes articles on Apple News, but is not participating in the subscription program.  Facebook, meanwhile, has sent mixed signals to publishers. In October, the world\u2019s largest social network began a test to support paywalls in Instant Articles and letting publishers keep all the revenue from subscriptions. In February, it launched a three-month pilot program to help local newspapers attract more subscribers.  But the company has also said its algorithm will start prioritizing News Feed posts from friends and families, hurting publishers\u2019 web traffic.  \u201cGoogle has been the most responsive of the major platforms in terms of listening, trying to understand what we need, and changing their business rules,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cWe\u2019ve not seen that kind of responsiveness from Facebook at all, actually.\u201d  \u2014 With assistance by Mark Gurman", "stock": "GOOGL", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-20", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-20/google-said-to-sweeten-deals-with-publishers-as-tech-woos-media"}, {"article": "John Giannandrea, the head of Google\u2019s cornerstone web-search unit, is stepping down from his role.

Google said it will create an AI lab dedicated to fundamental research on themes like automatic learning, language and a computer\u2019s ability to see, with the aim of applying findings to fields from health to the environment. The end-goal is to grow this group to a size similar to Google\u2019s existing team of 120 engineers who do applied research in Paris, working on developments for Chrome and YouTube, a company spokeswoman said.  Facebook, which already has an artificial intelligence lab in Paris, said it will double the team there to 100 people by 2022 and spend 10 million euros ($12.2 million) on items including hardware equipment. Both announcements came as part of a broader series of promises by these companies to increase budgets in France, with Google and Facebook also separately vowing to train citizens on digital tools.  \u201cFrance has all the assets to succeed. It has top engineers, great  entrepreneurs, one of the best education systems in the world, great infrastructure, and successful global companies,\u201d Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai wrote in a blog post. He reaffirmed a broader hiring target to reach 1,000 employees at Google\u2019s headquarters in the French capital, from 700 today.  Pichai and Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg are guests of Macron\u2019s on Monday, among 140 top executives from a variety of industries. In Versailles, company chiefs were invited to attend presentations by ministers, as well as private meetings and dinner with the president -- a full-fledged investor roadshow meant to convince CEOs to invest more in France, as they prepare to head to Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum.  SAP SE CEO Bill McDermott is also on the guest list. Europe\u2019s biggest software company said it will invest 2 billion euros over five years in France on research and development, as well as backing and acquiring startups.  SAP also announced Monday it\u2019s buying a French company called Recast.AI that specializes in artificial intelligence. Recast.AI, which develops conversational chatbots, will be part of SAP\u2019s efforts to add voice recognition to its products.  Macron\u2019s strategy to woo investors and bring more funds to the French ecosystem dates back before his days as president, and tech has always been at the core of it. When he was still economy minister two years ago, Macron used the grandeur of Versailles to try and convince technology-focused venture-capitalists, including Andreessen Horowitz and Accel Partners, that France is a good place for their money.  The French president has also expressed the goal of establishing France and Europe as leaders in global artificial intelligence innovation, to rival the U.S. and China. France is waiting for a report by member of Parliament, Cedric Villani, expected soon, before it unveils a national strategy on AI.  Still, Macron has toughened his stance on technology companies in recent months on issues like taxes. He brought it up with Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook during a meeting at the French presidential palace in September.  Taxation of tech companies will be part of talks in Versailles Monday, but they\u2019re not the reason for Macron\u2019s meetings with Pichai, Sandberg and others, according to an official at the president\u2019s office.  The dinner will be held at the Gallery of Great Battles in the Versailles Palace, where Macron hosted Russian President Vladimir Putin last year.

The deal will help Google design more of its own consumer hardware and could set it up to wade deeper into special-purpose chips -- like Apple. Google\u2019s most recent Pixel model came with a new image processor to improve the device\u2019s camera. More of this \"custom silicon\" will come in the future, Google\u2019s hardware chief Rick Osterloh said in an interview.  Osterloh brought in HTC engineers and designers to help Google control more of the design and production of its products, including working more closely with suppliers. Google previously focused on software and let manufacturers including Samsung Electronics Co. and HTC handle the hardware. But modern phones offer features like augmented reality and artificial intelligence-based services that require close integration of software and hardware.  \"You have to be vertical in some cases to really push the envelope for consumers,\" Osterloh said. \"Our intention is to invest in this for the long term. You\u2019ll see a steady increase in investment from us.\"  HTC said in a separate statement that it plans to proceed with its next flagship smartphone and will focus its efforts in the segment. \u201cToday marks the beginning of an exciting new chapter at HTC as we continue to drive innovation in our branded smartphone and VIVE virtual reality businesses,\u201d Cher Wang, chairwoman at HTC said in the statement.  For Google, a bigger step would be to create its own \"system-on-a-chip\" -- the main processors inside phones that Apple now inserts into its devices. Qualcomm Inc. provides the bulk of these chips to Android phone makers, and Osterloh said Google will keep working with the supplier for the foreseeable future.  Still, by designing more silicon itself, Google could cut business for other suppliers. Apple released its first system-on-a-chip in 2010, and has added special chips to store fingerprint and payment data, track motion, crunch graphics and run AI algorithms on mobile devices.  Google\u2019s Pixel sales have been a fraction of Apple\u2019s, but another phone maker designing more of its own components is a bad sign for suppliers. Dialog Semiconductor Plc slumped last month after telling investors that Apple, its biggest customer, could design its own power-management chips. Imagination Technologies Group Plc suffered a similar fate last year after Apple stopped buying the U.K. company\u2019s graphics chips in favor of in-house designs.  The HTC deal is also bad news for manufacturers of phones based on Google\u2019s Android operating system. Most of these companies have struggled to make money selling premium handsets that compete with the iPhone, while Google benefited from distributing search and other lucrative software services on those devices. Now Google is making its own high-end smartphones. The Pixel phone sold 1.5 million phones in 2017, up from 1 million the year before, according to Counterpoint Research. By contrast, Samsung is estimated to have shipped more than 300 million smartphone units last year.  If Android partners aren\u2019t alienated by Google\u2019s entrance, they are at least uneasy. After the Pixel arrived, some major Android manufacturers, like Samsung and Huawei Technologies Co., began to roll out more of their own services on their phones.  Other Android manufacturers \"know why we\u2019re doing this,\" Osterloh said. \"Quite honestly, Apple is doing really well in developed markets.\"  After the HTC deal, Google plans to expand research and marketing, cut deals with more phone carriers and retailers, and move into new markets. Sales remain limited to nine countries, including the U.S., Germany and Singapore.  \"China is obviously a very attractive smartphone market and we\u2019re certainly interested in going back to China in the future, but we don\u2019t have any plans to discuss and frankly it\u2019s complicated for the company,\" he said. Google pulled its services from mainland China in 2010 after refusing to censor its search results.  If Google\u2019s push into smartphones sounds familiar, that\u2019s because the latest deal echoes Google\u2019s $12.5 billion acquisition of Motorola Mobility in 2012. That experiment flopped. Google never integrated the business and sold most of it to Lenovo Group Ltd. for $2.91 billion. In a blog post, Alphabet CEO Larry Page said Motorola would be better off with a company that\u2019s \"all-in when it comes to making mobile devices.\"  Osterloh knows the history well. He was at Motorola after the purchase and stayed on to run it for the Chinese company.  So what makes things different this time around? \"The context, the time, it\u2019s a different world than it was during the PC-era,\" said Osterloh.

Google\u2019s firing of an engineer over his controversial memo criticizing its diversity policies and \u201cpolitically correct monoculture\u201d didn\u2019t violate U.S. labor law, a federal agency lawyer concluded.  Statements in James Damore\u2019s 3,000-word memo \u201cregarding biological differences between the sexes were so harmful, discriminatory, and disruptive\u201d that they fell outside protections for collective action in the workplace, an associate general counsel for the National Labor Relations Board wrote in a six-page memo disclosed Thursday.  Damore withdrew his complaint in January and his lawyer has said she\u2019s focusing instead on the engineer\u2019s lawsuit accusing the internet giant of harassing him and others over their conservative political views.  When he was dismissed in August, Damore accused Google of violating the employee right to engage in \"concerted activity\" to address workplace issues, a category which the labor board has found can include forms of activism ranging from lawsuits to strikes to social media posts.  \u201cMuch of\" Damore\u2019s memo was probably protected under the law, the labor board\u2019s attorney, Jayme Sophir, said in the Jan. 16 memo. But Sophir went on to find that Google discharged Damore only for his \"discriminatory statements,\" which aren\u2019t shielded by labor law.  Because companies have a duty to comply with equal employment laws and an interest in promoting diversity, \u201cemployers must be permitted to \u2018nip in the bud\u2019 the kinds of employee conduct that could lead to a \u2018hostile workplace,\u2019 rather than waiting until an actionable hostile workplace has been created before taking action,\" Sophir wrote.  The company \u201ccarefully tailored\" its messages in firing Damore and in addressing employees afterward \"to affirm their right to engage in protected speech while prohibiting discrimination or harassment.\" Google also disciplined one of Damore\u2019s co-workers for sending him a threatening email in response to the memo, Sophir said.

The big question is whether investors are overestimating the companies' ability to keep expanding their dominance.  The Alphabet Inc. unit and Facebook Inc. pulled in a combined $114 billion in revenue from advertisements in 2017, excluding the money that Google turns over to partners such as Apple. That means more than one out of every five dollars in the $500 billion global advertising market goes to Google and Facebook, based on Magna Global estimates of worldwide ad spending. Excluding advertising sales in China, where neither company has made much headway, Google and Facebook are responsible for about 25 percent of annual advertising revenue.  That's impressive, right? The companies grew into beasts because they changed how businesses from Ford to the corner coffee shop pitched to their customers. The local Yellow Pages, newspapers and magazines all lost advertising sales to varying degrees to Google and Facebook, which offered businesses a more efficient and effective way to persuade people to buy pickup trucks or drop by the store. In 2017, about 40 percent of all global advertising revenue was spent online, up from 20 percent six years earlier, the Magna estimates show. Google and Facebook led that shift and benefited from it more than any other companies.  Ad Assault Google and Facebook's combined advertising revenue is equivalent to 22 percent of the global ad market Data: Magna Global, Bloomberg Intelligence and company disclosures; graphic by Bloomberg Gadfly  But it gets harder for Google and Facebook from here, and it's not clear that the companies' stock market values reflect the difficulties of their mission. Both companies need to continue to grab advertising from television, radio and other places where businesses try to reach customers and expand into areas other than what is considered conventional consumer advertising. I'm more sanguine about the former than the latter.  First, I'll tackle the companies' market share task. The Magna data show that global advertising spending has increased an average of less than 5 percent annually since 2011, a bit faster than the expansion of the global economy over that period. Google and Facebook ad revenue has grown much faster -- 18 percent and 49 percent in 2017, respectively. In other words, the growth of Google and Facebook hasn't come so much from an increase in the total advertising pie but from grabbing bigger slices from other media.  To keep growing, Google and Facebook need to continue to expand their market share of the advertising pie. That's one reason why Google and Facebook are each trying to encroach on the turf of television, the source of $175 billion in annual advertising spending worldwide. But increasing their ad market share isn't enough.  Let's assume Google and Facebook expand their share of global advertising revenue excluding China to 40 percent in 2022 from the current 25 percent. That would work out to an estimated $216 billion in combined advertising revenue for Google and Facebook, based on Magna's ad market forecasts. That's a 14 percent compound annual growth rate for the companies, which would be a significant deceleration. Google and Facebook's combined advertising sales have grown 22 percent to 28 percent a year since 2014.  Advertising Royalty Google and Facebook's ad sales are growing much more quickly than the total advertising market. Growth rates for each: Data: Company disclosures and Magna Global via Bloomberg Intelligence; graphic by Bloomberg Gadfly  To grow at the rate investors expect, then, Google and Facebook need \"moonshots.\" I'm not necessarily talking about autonomous cars, technology to let people hear through their skin and other projects the companies are cooking up in their science labs. Google and Facebook need moonshots in their primary business of advertising, too.  That could mean expanding into what is thought of as marketing, such as the email messages and coupons that companies pay to send to their customers. It could be selling software used by marketing departments, as Adobe and Salesforce provide now. Or Google and Facebook could find ways to take a slice of revenue when they refer people to buy from local merchants. Those are all ways Google and Facebook could tap large pools of revenue outside of but adjacent to their core advertising businesses.  It's possible each company could continue to thrive just by sticking to advertising. The companies have grabbed more ad market share than many people expected, and that could continue. Both companies are also trying to diversify into non-ad areas such as virtual reality and cloud computing.  For the foreseeable future, though, Google and Facebook are reliant on advertising. Alphabet generates 86 percent of its revenue from advertising; at Facebook the figure is 98 percent. The companies may be running out of room to grow before they hit a ceiling in advertising. And that may flip their iron grip on advertising from a strength to a vulnerability.

Columbus actually wanted to find a faster way to India and discovered America. The situation is similar for a German asset manager in the 21st century. For years, he has been trading successfully on the basis of an options strategy. Then he asks his IT administrator to test new strategies. Unplanned they develop an artificial intelligence that has recently become the manager of a new fund by the company.  The Frankfurt based asset manager Wallrich Wolf Asset Management AG has been in business with their short-options-fund for ten years. The portfolio managers regularly sell put options and earn the option premium. Until 2011 the fund was fully invested most of the time, which provided steady income, but did not allow scope for new positions when volatility increased.  Managing director Stefan Wallrich was keen to know, what strategies and optimizations work and asked his IT administrator, who is actually responsible for the maintenance of computers and servers, to support him in a so-called backtest. A backtest is a common practice in portfolio management to try new ideas or optimize existing ones. 20 strategies were calculated by Wallrich back to the year 2008. Among other things, this showed that, in principle, a variable degree of exposure in the portfolio, depending on the current market volatility, produces good results.  \"Until then, I was happy with the results, because I just wanted to backtest some strategies to optimize our existing fund,\" says Wallrich, who manages more than 350 million euros ($427 million) with his team in various portfolios. But then came the big \"enlightment\".  Which degree of investment is the right one? Wallrich\u2019s IT expert Marcel Heintz developed an artificial intelligence that constantly calculates different investment levels, checks them and questions the results. The machine is given the requirement to keep a portion of the portfolio permanently invested in order to generate regular income through the option sale and at the same time, depending on the level of volatility, to move the investment level up or down. With low volatility, less investment should be made and, with high volatility and thus high premiums, even more than 100 percent of the portfolio should be invested. Otherwise the machine is free to decided on the degree of investment by itself.  \"The AI \u200b\u200bconstantly assesses its results and questions how it came to the conclusion and how it can do even better in the future,\" explains Sebastian Franz, who was involved in the development as a DHBW-student.  Artificial intelligence technology differs from the more traditional quant investment approch, in that it mimics the human brain\u2019s learning capacity. When new data comes in, the algorithm modifies its behavior. A machine detects non-linear patterns, without the help of a human being.  More about AI with asset managers:  This AI-Robot Picks Stocks Based on Millions of Human Emotions  \u2019Warren in a Box\u2019 Picks Stocks for First Nordic AI Fund  QuickTake: Artificial Intelligence  After a year of research and convincing results, Wallrich decides to give it a try and in December 2017 launches a new fund, which is managed only by the AI.  \"We could have used the computer in our traditional strategy, but in order to give the topic the attention it deserves, we decided to launch a new fund,\" says Wallrich. \"Also to distinguish the AI from the old fund and to be able to evaluate the success in the long term.\"  The fund currently manages 7 million euros ($8.5 million) and, like most AI funds, is still at the beginning. For Wallrich, the AI topic is not a revolution, but an evolution, and he wants to further improve the \"intelligence factor\" in the coming months.  New Intelligence AI funds are still young but already manage millions Source: Bloomberg  For example, one could extend the AI \u200b\u200bby additional volatility variables or check how exchange rates or macroeconomic data change the decision path of the machine. In addition, it would be possible to launch several funds with basically the same strategy but different risk-return profiles. With the AI \u200b\u200bit is possible to manage several different portfolios cost-effectively and with less highly qualified portfolio managers.  In 2018 he aims for a fund volume of 15 million euros. In the medium term, \"it can and should become significantly more,\" says Wallrich. However, that depends on the success of the AI \u200b\u200bstrategy. \"If it works, of which I\u2019m very confident, the volume could sky rocket.\"  One has to go with the time and competition makes it necessary to stay innovative, Wallrich says. He could think of abandoning the classic portfolio management completely at some point and leave the money management fully to the machine. \"The machine is simply better at many things, while we have emotional discussions in our portfolio management team,\" Wallrich says.

Google co-founder Larry Page and futurist Ray Kurzweil could be among your lecturers in the Graduate Studies Program at Singularity, named for the notion that humans will someday merge with machines. You\u2019d work in a kind of combination think tank and startup incubator, trying to address challenges as grand as renewable energy and space travel. Kurzweil announced the program during a TED Talk in 2009, adding that the Singularity team had leased its campus from NASA, just east of the agency\u2019s historic Hangar One in Mountain View, Calif. The team received 1,200 applications for its first class of 40 later that year.  Reality hasn\u2019t matched the hype. Previously unreported police files, other documents, and interviews with current and former students and staff paint the picture that almost from the beginning, some Singularity staffers weren\u2019t able to curb their worst impulses. A teacher allegedly sexually assaulted a former student, an executive stole more than $15,000, a former staffer alleges gender and disability discrimination, and Singularity dismissed 14 of about 170 staffers and suspended GSP, now called the Global Solutions Program, after Google withdrew funding last year.  Alumni say for-profit Singularity is becoming just another organizer of conferences and executive seminars. It\u2019s weighing buying the seminar company Abundance 360, started by Singularity co-founder Peter Diamandis. \u201cIt\u2019s lost its soul,\u201d says Vivek Wadhwa, who ran the faculty until 2013 and is at Carnegie Mellon University. \u201cIt\u2019s become a moneymaking corporation.\u201d  \u201cIf we want to make true impact \u2026 we need to do it in a sustainable fashion\u201d  While Singularity says it takes seriously its community\u2019s security and any related allegations, most of those matters are far in the past, says Chief Executive Officer Rob Nail. He says he was already planning to suspend and reevaluate GSP before Google ended its annual grant of $1.5 million. The grant covered about half the costs of the program, which was free for participants. Google, whose senior manager Jen Phillips left Singularity\u2019s advisory board late last year and won\u2019t be replaced, says it plans to focus on Singularity\u2019s entrepreneurship programs instead.  Nail says although GSP may be reborn largely online, conferences and executive education (tuition: $14,500 for a weeklong program) will become the bulk of Singularity\u2019s work. It held 10 conferences last year and has 18 planned for 2018. On Feb. 15 it announced it raised $32 million in venture funding led by Boeing Co. and investment firm WestRiver Group. Erik Anderson, WestRiver\u2019s CEO, is replacing Diamandis as Singularity\u2019s chairman. These changes, Nail says, will help the company turn a profit and thereby aid more people. \u201cIf we want to make true impact,\u201d he says, \u201cwe need to do it in a sustainable fashion.\u201d  Singularity had NASA connections beyond its rented buildings. Early GSP students speak highly of a lecture by former astronaut Dan Barry, a physician who got into the space shuttle program after 13 rejections. Several say they saw him as a mentor. Barry hasn\u2019t taught GSP students since 2013, when the company investigated him for allegedly sexually assaulting Yasemin Baydaroglu, a French student who attended GSP in 2011.  Baydaroglu says Barry arranged a 2013 meetup in Paris. They went for a bike ride, during which she complained of back pain, and then went to his hotel to chat. He reminded her he was a doctor, she says, and offered her a massage, speaking in strictly medical terms. Because he was a mentor, she trusted him\u2014until, she says, he touched her breasts and genitals, and she fled. \u201cI really didn\u2019t see it coming, and I\u2019m so careful,\u201d she says. \u201cThis time my guard was low.\u201d She reported the incident to police several days later, then visited a doctor.  \u201cI completely deny her accusations,\u201d Barry says, adding that the inquiries that followed led to \u201ca distressing time for me and my wife.\u201d  Baydaroglu showed signs of psychological distress that she said were linked to a physical assault, according to a copy of a May 31, 2013, doctor\u2019s report reviewed by Bloomberg Businessweek. According to a copy of a letter sent from France\u2019s Office of the Prosecutor, it declined to pursue the case because authorities hadn\u2019t been able to find Barry.  Singularity began its internal investigation after Baydaroglu separately reported the alleged assault to the company. Barry left that summer\u2019s program in June; his wife was ill, and the company told students he left for personal reasons. In a June 22, 2013, email to Baydaroglu reviewed by Bloomberg Businessweek, a Singularity human resources official told her Nail believed \u201cthe facts around the central allegation of unwanted sexual touching are inconclusive\u201d but that he told Barry the circumstances indicated \u201cpoor judgment.\u201d The official wrote that Barry wouldn\u2019t be present for the remainder of the 2013 GSP and asked Baydaroglu not to discuss the matter with other parties.  \u201cWe respectfully request that within the SU community, you keep our discussions and this conclusion confidential,\u201d the HR official wrote. She added that Baydaroglu shouldn\u2019t allow the company\u2019s investigation to influence her decision about civil or criminal legal processes, and offered company support for services such as counseling.  The email outlined steps Singularity was taking to reduce the likelihood of staffers being in \u201cpotentially intimate situations\u201d on campus, including prohibiting them from being alone with a student at the end of a program day and installing webcams to monitor classrooms. Baydaroglu says Singularity\u2019s response left her feeling deeply depressed and betrayed. Particularly galling, she says, was \u201casking me not to talk about it.\u201d The company declined to discuss the case except to say Barry hasn\u2019t been an active faculty member since 2013.  Singularity leaders have a history of shady financial practices. When the organization was in its infancy in 2009, Alicia Isaac, the financial controller, used its credit cards to make $13,500 in personal purchases; she also kept the cash from a $2,000 check to Singularity, according to a subsequent police report. And she helped the president of an artificial intelligence institute try to steal almost $80,000. Police arrested Isaac in 2009; she pleaded no contest to felony fraud charges. Isaac didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.  Another early Singularity architect, Bruce Klein, was convicted in 2012 of running a credit fraud operation in Alabama. He\u2019s no longer associated with the company. Board member Naveen Jain was convicted of insider trading in 2003. He appealed a $247 million judgment and ultimately settled.  Nail, who previously helped found an automation company, arrived in late 2011 with Chief Strategy Officer Gabriel Baldinucci, a former Virgin Group executive. They soon changed Singularity from a nonprofit to a for-profit B Corporation, which means a private accreditor certifies it meets certain social and environmental standards.  For years several staffers close to Baldinucci lived alongside him in a series of rented houses nicknamed the SU Villa, in Atherton and Woodside, Calif. Other employees say the group got favorable treatment and the general atmosphere was unfriendly to women. Eleanor Schuermann, a lawyer at Kastner Kim LLP, is representing a staffer who alleges Singularity discriminated against her because of her gender and disability, paid her less than men in the same position, and retaliated against her for complaining. The attorney\u2019s filings with state regulators, the first steps toward a lawsuit, aren\u2019t yet public record. Schuermann, who wouldn\u2019t name her client, says she\u2019s heard from two other Singularity employees about similar claims. The company declined to comment on the case but says it works hard to support women.  Singularity is a long way from 2009, when the first GSP led to the creation of Getaround, a car-sharing company that\u2019s raised $85 million from investors including Toyota Motor Corp. \u201cIt is amazing what all has happened here,\u201d Google\u2019s Page said during the program\u2019s opening ceremony the following year. \u201cIt exceeded all my expectations.\u201d These days, Page isn\u2019t involved with Singularity. Kurzweil doesn\u2019t dispute that while he attends board meetings, he rarely speaks.  Anderson, the new chairman, says the company expects to meet its revenue and social goals. Nail says it\u2019s making good on some of its grander ambitions, citing work on United Nations anti-hunger efforts. Still, he says, Singularity can do better: \u201cWe\u2019re nowhere near impacting the billion people our students talk about.\u201d", "stock": "GOOGL", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-15", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-15/silicon-valley-s-singularity-university-has-some-serious-reality-problems"}, {"article": "Connecting decision makers to a dynamic network of information, people and ideas, Bloomberg quickly and accurately delivers business and financial information, news and insight around the world.

Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos Can\u2019t Beat Washington, So He\u2019s Joining It: The Influence Game  In the final days of 2017, President Donald Trump attacked Amazon, tweeting that the U.S. Postal Service should charge the world's largest online retailer \"MUCH MORE!\" for delivering packages. It capped a year of criticism from Trump about Amazon's market power, impact on jobs and ties to the Washington Post, which Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos owns. While that Twitter barrage grabbed headlines, behind the scenes, the e-commerce giant was furiously expanding lobbying efforts that have quickly made it one of the most-influential companies in Washington, according to data compiled by Bloomberg News. In the past five years, Amazon increased lobbying spending by more than 400 percent, a rate of change that far exceeds rivals\u2019. It lobbied more government agencies than any other tech company, pressed its case on as many issues as Google, and outspent everyone in the industry except for the search giant, the data show. \"They quietly went from Chihuahua to Great Dane in just a few years,\" said Bruce Mehlman, a former top technology policy official under President George W. Bush.  Sources: Senate Office of Public Record, Bloomberg research  Amazon.com Inc. has good reasons to amplify its presence in Washington. Big tech's long honeymoon of public goodwill is over and the company feels the painful transition as much as competitors like Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Facebook Inc. Amazon is fighting to be seen as a job creator, not a job killer, and is often blamed when traditional retail outlets close. \"They are getting smacked right and left with questions about whether they are undermining sectors, harming local business opportunities, actually undercutting innovation, destroying jobs and harming democracy,\" said Gene Kimmelman, president of the policy group Public Knowledge. To counter that impression, Amazon is making both public and private moves. In public, Bezos meets with lawmakers and attended President Trump's awkward summit with technology CEOs at Trump Tower in late 2016. Before Trump\u2019s inauguration, the Amazon founder also pledged to hire 100,000 workers over the next 18 months, paying homage to Trump's push to get companies to employ more Americans. Gone is the feisty combativeness on display during the presidential election, when Bezos offered on Twitter to give candidate Trump a free ride off the planet with the hashtag #SendDonaldToSpace. Behind the scenes, Amazon has increased its lobbying of lawmakers and government agencies, which can keep a crackdown at bay. Last year, for example, for the first time in nearly two decades, Amazon lobbied the Justice Department, which has broad criminal and civil enforcement powers spanning antitrust, national security and corporate wrongdoing. What makes Amazon different from its tech brethren is the company\u2019s insatiable quest to sell everything from advertising to entertainment, groceries, computing power and soon, maybe even health care. That forces it to wrestle with a growing list of issues, including transportation, shipping, aviation, taxes, immigration and antitrust. Last year, it lobbied on 24 general issues (each of which could include dozens of laws or regulations), up from eight in 2012. Entities lobbied, such as the Senate and NASA, jumped from eight in 2012 to 39 in 2017. Microsoft Corp., which survived a prolonged antitrust case in the 1990s, lobbied on 18 issues and engaged with 29 government agencies last year. Amazon has fought for favorable rules regarding online sales taxes since 2000. But its rise as a Washington powerhouse really began amid a flurry of activity in 2013. That fall, Bezos acquired the Washington Post for $250 million from its longtime owners, the Graham family, and two months later, unveiled Prime Air, a nascent project to speed deliveries using drones. At the time, the Federal Aviation Administration required unmanned aircraft to be flown within the line of sight of operators. Amazon argued the rules were designed for hobbyists, not commercial operators.

Rather than give up, the company re-doubled its efforts to influence rule-making and policymakers. Amazon also set about expanding its physical presence in the capital. In 2014, the company traded its old Washington offices in a small townhouse near a highway exit with spotty Wi-Fi for a modern office building on the same street as lobbying powerhouses like the National Association of Realtors. The new digs, home to Amazon policy staff and other employees, have polished cement floors and an exhibit showcasing the company's growth from niche bookseller to titan of online commerce. From its comfortable new perch, Amazon rapidly expanded its lobbying efforts. It started lobbying the White House in 2014, according to federal disclosures, and has every year since. In 2015, it hired former Obama White House Press Secretary Jay Carney as senior vice president of corporate affairs. He now oversees the Washington policy office, which has almost doubled its number of registered lobbyists to 27 from two years ago. That roster does not include outside lobbyists like former Senator John Breaux, a Democrat, and his Republican partner, onetime Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott. \u201cAs one of the biggest job creators in the country, we\u2019ve expanded our team in Washington, D.C., to ensure we are able to cover the growing range of topics that are important to policymakers, our employees, and our customers,\u201d Brian Huseman, Amazon's vice president of public policy, said in a statement.  Amazon's lobbying spending grew the fastest Percent change in spending since 2012 Sources: Senate Office of Public Record, Bloomberg research  Winning friends in Washington has become a necessity for Amazon as it moves into more territory overseen by federal agencies. It's delivering groceries to food-stamp recipients in a trial run by the Agriculture Department. It handles hundreds of billions of dollars in transactions and lends money to small businesses selling goods on its site, requiring the company work with financial regulators. It lobbies for postal reform and infrastructure spending to get orders to customers more quickly. Amazon's cloud-computing business may have the most at stake. In 2013, it won a multi-year CIA contract, and is in the running for a decade-long Defense Department cloud contract potentially worth billions more. The Pentagon awarded a separate $950 million cloud contract to an Amazon affiliate earlier this month. The government seems pleased with these arrangements so far. The CIA's John Edwards delivered a 13-minute testimonial in June to thousands of people at an Amazon-sponsored event at Washington\u2019s convention center, saying partnering with Amazon Web Services is \u201cthe most innovative thing we\u2019ve ever done.\u201d In 2016, Bezos was appointed to the Defense Innovation Advisory Board, which aims to keep the Pentagon atop new technologies. He hosted Defense Secretary James Mattis at Amazon\u2019s Seattle headquarters in August, posting pictures of the visit on Twitter.  A pleasure to host #SecDef James Mattis at Amazon HQ in Seattle today pic.twitter.com/JnQZoSOnFN \u2014 Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) August 10, 2017  Amazon began lobbying the Defense Department in 2016 and did so again last year, according to federal disclosures. It has lobbied other federal agencies on issues related to cloud computing for at least six years, trying to change the way government buys and uses tech services. Amazon's most-recent effort focuses on music. It's supporting the Music Modernization Act, which would change the way artists and license holders get paid when people buy or stream digital music. Steve Boom, vice president of Amazon Music, worked the halls of Congress on the bill at the end of January. Amazon also hosted a meeting in a congressional office building where the sponsor of the legislation, Georgia Republican Representative Doug Collins, thanked the company for its months of work, a person familiar with the event said.

The winner gets $5 billion in investment over 15 years and up to 50,000 jobs, making Amazon a welcome guest for lawmakers in those states \u2013 regardless of what issue the company wants to discuss. And Washington, Virginia and Maryland are all contenders. Along with his company\u2019s lobbying presence, Bezos has increased his personal visibility in Washington. In the fall of 2016, he bought the 27,000-square-foot former textile museum for an East Coast pied-\u00e0-terre. It's in the same tony Washington neighborhood where the Obamas, Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump live. He\u2019s planning salon-style dinners at the house with DC power-players and celebrities in the tradition of former Washington Post publisher Katharine Graham, according to a recent New York Times profile. \u201cI don\u2019t doubt that he loves journalism and thinks that \u2018Democracy Dies in the Dark,\u2019\u201d Scott Galloway, a professor at New York University, said, paraphrasing the newspaper\u2019s new motto. \u201cBut boy, it\u2019s convenient to have the Post and a home in Washington.

Those peers\u2014other San Francisco judges and attorneys\u2014run the spectrum, in her view, from liberal to far lefty. The sort of people she\u2019s surrounded by and specializes in riling up. But it can be exhausting.  \u201cIf I go today, I\u2019ll be devoured by judges and attorneys asking me how I could represent James,\u201d Harmeet Dhillon says of the annual bar association dinner. This was in January, months after her new client, James Damore, became an inescapable flashpoint in the workplace-gender war. Dhillon had just finished an interview on Fox News, where she makes regular appearances. She ditched the dinner and sat down for another interview instead.  Dhillon is a Republican in the People\u2019s Republic of Northern California. She\u2019s an outspoken supporter of President Donald Trump, and one of three elected leaders of the state\u2019s Republican National Committee.  She\u2019s a free-speech lawyer who argues the University of California at Berkeley stifled the First Amendment when it bumped a speech by conservative Ann Coulter. She doesn\u2019t believe in fake-news conspiracies and, in an appearance on Fox News, has denounced Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation as \u201cabsolutely\u201d corrupt. \u201cI didn\u2019t say Mueller was corrupt. But the investigation itself, it appears to be corrupt on many levels.\u201d  \u201cShe\u2019s a person of some dichotomy. On the one hand, she was on the board of the ACLU and fights for many individual rights,\u201d says Neel Chatterjee, a San Francisco lawyer who\u2019s known Dhillon since the 1980s. \u201cOn the other hand, she\u2019s a staunch Republican Trump supporter.\u201d And as Chatterjee notes: \u201cShe likes fighting political fights.\u201d  \u201cWhen Harmeet decided to lend her voice to the Trump campaign, there were, especially in the South Asian community, a lot of people who really questioned her integrity and her good faith,\u201d says Paul Grewal, a childhood friend and Facebook Inc.\u2019s general counsel. \u201cShe made very clear in the toughest moments of that campaign that what she was standing up for were her own conservative ideals.\u201d  In the legal complaint against Google, Harmeet Dhillon positions her client, James Damore, as someone in her own mold\u2014a conservative in a liberal bubble defending his rights. Photographer: Michael Liedtke/AP  Dhillon, 49, is in America\u2019s progressive hub summoning her own life experience to craft a novel legal argument that posits Damore in her own mold: a conservative in a liberal bubble demanding and using free-speech rights.  Dhillon won\u2019t say whether she agrees with her client\u2019s 3,000-word manifesto, the one Damore used to blast Google\u2019s diversity policies before he was fired. In it he asserts, among other things, that biological variances are a likely explanation for Silicon Valley\u2019s lopsided gender gap. But Dhillon does agree that Google\u2019s work culture crushes conservative ideology while promoting a liberal echo chamber. That ethos, she argues, is ultimately what fueled her client\u2019s termination.  Central to her case are a pair of 81-year-old sections of California\u2019s Labor Code that prohibit employers from controlling employees\u2019 political expression at work or firing them because of it. Where the U.S. Constitution\u2019s First Amendment ends, says Dhillon, California\u2019s statute begins.  Dhillon argues that Google\u2019s work culture changed in November 2016, after Trump\u2019s electoral victory. Within days the reality of his victory set in, and many Google employees were in a panic, \u201chaving expected a different outcome fully in line with their political views,\u201d Dhillon wrote in the 161-page complaint. The document mentions Trump nine times and uses the word \u201cconservative\u201d 101 times.  The lawsuit appears designed to maximally embarrass one of the world\u2019s biggest companies. One section of her complaint\u2014under the heading \u201cGoogle Failed to Protect Employees from Workplace Harassment Due to Their Support for President Trump\u201d\u2014decries unnamed managers for sabotaging the careers of conservative employees while promoting like-minded progressives, and in another instance, Google employees allegedly encouraged \u201cunambiguous social pecking\u201d of conservative white men. Later, she accuses Google of welcoming a diverse realm of alternative lifestyles on its internal message boards, including mailing lists for employees identifying sexually as \u201cyellow-scaled wingless dragonkin.\u201d But, she notes, the tech giant neglected to create or encourage such a venue for \u201ctraditional monogamy.\u201d  Dhillon says she\u2019s the advocate for a true underdog here. While Google welcomes the \u201cfurries and transgender,\u201d she says, conservative men are blacklisted. Among the loudest voices demanding social equality for conservative white males is, of course, President Trump.  Her approach to equality in Silicon Valley is an obvious deviation from the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements that have dominated social media in tandem with growing calls for gender equality for women in tech, Hollywood and elsewhere. In fact, while Dhillon sues Google for plotting to hire and promote women instead of men, the U.S. Department of Labor has filed suit against the company for quite the opposite: not hiring enough women.  Dhillon describes them as two different problems. Finding more women in the industry is a pipeline challenge. So long as American universities are churning out four male tech candidates for every one woman, she says, the supply issue can\u2019t be solved. To achieve balance in Silicon Valley, employers cannot stop hiring men: \u201cThat\u2019s not legal.\u201d  Harmeet Dhillon offered a Sikh prayer to open the second day of the 2016 Republican National Convention. Photographer: John Taggart/Bloomberg  Her ideals were born out of her tiny hometown in rural North Carolina, at her dinner table where her devout parents taught her about tort reform, taxation and what it meant to be an immigrant in Jimmy Carter\u2019s America. Coming from India\u2019s socialized democracy in the 1970s, when Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was on the cusp of temporarily suspending the nation\u2019s constitution, the idea of intense government intervention and regulation didn\u2019t resonate with the tax-averse, gun-holding Dhillon family. They fled India for the United Kingdom, then to America\u2019s promise of free-market capitalism, only to be miffed by the Carter administration\u2019s tax rates on capital gains. Discussions often centered on the U.S. gas shortage, flaws in socialism, foreign policy and family values.  Senator Jesse Helms, a leading North Carolina conservative at the time, was central to the family\u2019s political identity. As he spoke out against the Indian government\u2019s persecution of Sikhs, he won favor with the Punjabi diaspora in his own backyard. In the 1980s the Dhillon household became a political hub for Helms, who found wealthy donors among the state\u2019s hundreds of Sikh families.  While mulling her career path, Dhillon considered following her father into medicine. He never discouraged her, but he did describe surgery as physically taxing while asking her to contemplate her own physical strength and endurance. \u201cWomen have a lot of choices, and they frequently choose not to go into certain fields, which is totally legitimate,\u201d she says.  \u201cMy father was a turban-wearing man of faith when he decided to be a Republican in a Democratically controlled, Klan-heavy state in the South.\u201d  Instead, Dhillon studied classics at Dartmouth before going to law school at the University of Virginia. Her politics began to take shape as she served as editor-in-chief of the Dartmouth Review, a biweekly conservative newspaper, where in 1988 she published a satirical column likening the school\u2019s president to Adolf Hitler. She told the New York Times then that the column sought to shine light on \u201cliberal fascism,\u201d while demonstrating how the school had mistreated conservative students.  Now, as a Republican Party official in California, she applies her professional stature as a free-speech lawyer to advocate for conservatives. For example: She\u2019s representing the UC Berkeley students who are suing the school for snubbing Coulter.  Damore\u2019s class-action case fits that mold, arguing that he and other conservatives have been ostracized because their ideology was \u201cun-Googley\u201d at a place where there\u2019s an incentive for discriminating against whites, males and conservatives.  Dhillon was one of Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019s candidates to help run the Department of Justice\u2019s civil rights division, and she was reportedly considered for other political appointments in California and D.C. Had she gotten the civil rights job, Dhillon says, she would have prioritized First Amendment violations against conservatives, chased down human traffickers and fought for free speech at abortion clinics.  \u201cI\u2019m a supporter of the administration and the president, and that\u2019s my position. As a member of the RNC, if I couldn\u2019t support them on important issues, then I would resign my position,\u201d she says.  At a June 2016 Trump rally in San Jose, Dhillon witnessed city police ushering his supporters into the teeth of what would quickly boil over into a bloody confrontation with anti-Trump demonstrators. Stones and fists flew; red hats burned. The lawsuit, on behalf of 20 pro-Trump protesters, was Dhillon\u2019s reintroduction to national politics. The headlines opened doors for Dhillon, making her a fixture on Fox News as its only South Asian contributor. (Dhillon defeated San Jose\u2019s bid to dismiss the case, which is under appeal in federal court.)  Torn Trump signs lie on the ground behind a police skirmish line, during a protest near a rally held by then-presidential candidate Donald Trump in San Jose on June 2, 2016. Photographer: Josh Edelson/AFP via Getty Images  Weeks after her Trump protest suit was filed, she offered a Sikh prayer to open the second day of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, covering her head during the Punjabi invocation that sought holy protection and guidance for America to uphold the values of humility, truth and justice. Trump accepted the party\u2019s nomination the next day. In response, she says, she received death threats from fellow Sikhs and Indians.  Dhillon is soft-spoken about the ways in which she differs from her party and, particularly, the president. She does say America needs immigrants\u2014legal immigrants. An advocate for federalism, she\u2019d prefer to leave the federal government out of marriage and abortion rights. \u201cLife begins at conception,\u201d she says. \u201cAbortion should only be allowed in limited circumstances\u2014life of the mother and rape.\u201d She hates talking about that time she wrote now-Democratic Senator Kamala Harris a $250 check for a city campaign. \u201cIt was a nonpartisan race,\u201d she says, sounding like she has made this case before.  In 2012 she ran her latest political campaign, vying for a seat in the California State Senate. She was trounced in San Francisco\u2019s famed Castro neighborhood, but the 54,887 votes she won were the most ever for a Republican in the state\u2019s 11th District. She credits that small victory and her subsequent success to bending her California environment to her family, her party and her own ideals.  \u201cMy father was a turban-wearing man of faith when he decided to be a Republican in a Democratically controlled, Klan-heavy state in the South,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not Nikki Haley, and I\u2019m not Bobby Jindal.

The effort has had mixed results, at best, in the past.  With a trade war brewing between the world\u2019s two largest economies, the goal has gotten loftier still.  Tim Cook, chief executive officer of Apple, Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, and Ginny Rometty, head of IBM, are scheduled to attend the China Development Forum, an annual gathering that helps Western corporations build relationships with the country\u2019s government officials.  Cook is co-chairing the event this year, and Apple has the most at stake in China among U.S. tech companies. Its iPhones and other gadgets have sold well in the country, but revenue from the region fell in Apple\u2019s last fiscal year. The Cupertino, California-based company has also been criticized recently for relocating the data of Chinese iCloud users to state-controlled server farms.  Last year, International Business Machines Corp. announced a deal with Chinese company Wanda Group at the forum. The deal was meant to help IBM expand in the country\u2019s cloud market, though Caixin reported recently that Wanda would stop working with the U.S. company.  Google pulled out of mainland China in 2010 over government censorship of its search results. The company has been trying to return in recent years, but has made little progress.  These hurdles will only get higher if a trade war erupts between the U.S. and China. On Thursday, President Donald Trump ordered 25 percent tariffs on at least $50 billion of Chinese imports, including information and communication technology. He also accused China of stealing intellectual property. China responded with its own duties on some U.S. imports.  Apple could see a negative effect on about 15 percent of its business if China were to retaliate with duties on imports of U.S. products, Loup Ventures\u2019 Gene Munster said in an email earlier on Thursday.  Steve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm\u2019s CEO, will attend the conference but has canceled his plan to speak.  The conference comes just days after Bloomberg News reported that Chinese regulators are seeking more protections for local companies before approving Qualcomm\u2019s proposed purchase of NXP Semiconductors NV. China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce isn\u2019t satisfied with the remedies that Qualcomm has offered so far and has told the company to propose more, people familiar with the matter have said.  China is the world\u2019s biggest market for smartphones and a crucial customer base of Qualcomm\u2019s chips for mobile phones. The San Diego, California-based company won the right to extend its technology licensing business in China in 2015 after paying a fine and agreeing to charge lower rates to local customers on phones for that market.  \u2014 With assistance by Mark Bergen, Ian King, and Gerrit De Vynck", "stock": "GOOGL", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-23", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-23/apple-google-ibm-ceos-head-to-china-with-trade-war-brewing"}, {"article": "Alphabet Inc. is changing a closely watched measure of Google\u2019s digital advertising business and adjusting how it accounts for some private stock holdings, a move that will make reported income more volatile.  The main difference is in how Google discloses the performance of its Network business, which runs ads on thousands of third-party websites. This will no longer be reported on a \"cost-per-click\" basis, or how many times the ads are clicked on. Instead, Google will report changes based on cost per impression -- the number of times the ads are viewed. In the fourth quarter of 2017, Google reported $5 billion in sales from network sites.  By using impressions, Google is providing a more-accurate reflection of its second-biggest business, after search, said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group. Most marketers already buy banner and video ads on websites based on impressions rather than cost-per-click. \"CPC is a meaningless number,\" he said.  The company also said that unrealized gains and losses on non-marketable equity securities, such as investments in private companies, will be reported as part of income. The tech giant has backed many large closely held companies including Uber Technologies Inc., Lyft Inc., and Magic Leap.  As a result, the company said it expects \"increased volatility\" on its income statement.  Finally, Alphabet said it will begin to report sales from Nest, its connected-home device division, under Google rather than its catch-all Other Bets segment.

Two anonymous people, who describe themselves in court filings as businessmen, want the search engine to take down links to information about their old convictions.  One of the men had been found guilty of conspiracy to account falsely, and the other of conspiracy to intercept communications, Judge Matthew Nicklin said at a pre-trial hearing Thursday. Those convictions are old and are now covered by an English law -- designed to rehabilitate offenders -- that says they can effectively be ignored. With a few exceptions, they don\u2019t have to be disclosed to potential employers.  \u201cThis is the first time that the English court is going to decide the issue of the right to be forgotten,\u201d Nicklin said.  The search-engine giant has already become embroiled in battles at the European Union\u2019s top court over the right to be forgotten. The principle -- created by the EU\u2019s highest court in a precedent-setting ruling in May 2014 -- allows people to ask for links to online information about them to be removed from search results if it\u2019s outdated or irrelevant. The ruling is only valid in the 28-nation bloc, but Google has clashed with privacy regulators over attempts to apply it beyond the EU.  \u201cWe work hard to comply with the right to be forgotten, but we take great care not to remove search results that are clearly in the public interest and will defend the public\u2019s right to access lawful information,\u201d a Google spokeswoman said.  Lawyers for the plaintiffs didn\u2019t comment.  Not Celebrities  Nicklin said Thursday that while the two cases were not related, they raised the same legal issues. The first trial, in which the person challenging Google to remove information is known as NT1, will start on Feb. 27 and the second, in which the plaintiff is known as NT2, will start on March 13. Nicklin said the plaintiffs weren\u2019t celebrities or politicians and have been \u201crehabilitated\u201d since their convictions.  NT1 has been threatened in public places by people referring to the content that Google links to, \u201cand seeking to extract money from him in consequence,\u201d his court filings say. He \u201chas been and continues to be treated as a pariah in his personal, business and social life and has been unable to form any new friendships or personal relationships,\u201d they say.  \u2018Adverse Attention\u2019  NT2\u2019s papers say some financial institutions are unwilling to deal with him \u201con private or commercial business\u201d after looking him up on Google. The search engine results have attracted \u201cadverse attention\u201d to him and by association to members of his close family.  The case concerns an \u201carea of the law in which two human rights come into conflict,\u201d Nicklin said. \u201cThe right to be forgotten is a dimension of the right to privacy and it conflicts with the right of freedom of expression.\u201d  He said a U.K. law from 1974 meant that, for all but the most serious offenses, people with convictions shouldn\u2019t \u201chave a lifelong \u2018blot\u2019 on their record but should be able to live without that shadow.\u201d The internet \u201cprovides a challenge\u201d to that right, he said, but also noted that some people were concerned that the right to be forgotten \u201cmight lead, in effect, to censorship.\u201d  Google has \u201cstaked quite a lot of resources\u201d on trying to do a good job of deciding when to approve requests for links to be taken down, said George Brock, a journalism professor at City, University of London and the author of a 2016 book about the right to be forgotten. He said Google had been \u201copaque\u201d about its approach to making those decisions. If this case shed light on how it reached the decisions, \u201cit would be a real breakthrough,\u201d he said.  Super-Injunctions  The men are being represented by the law firm Carter Ruck. It has defended clients in privacy and libel actions and was one of the first firms to use super-injunctions, court orders that prevent publication of any confidential information relating to a person or an issue and also any existence of the order itself.  The pair\u2019s court papers say that revealing their identity would \u201cdefeat the object of the claims.\u201d  Google has publicly raised the alarm about risks to freedom of speech that it says are posed by the right to be forgotten. Two separate European Court of Justice cases about that right \u201crepresent a serious assault on the public\u2019s right to access lawful information,\u201d Google\u2019s general counsel, Kent Walker, said in a blog post in November.

To be the first to know, please click here.  Google unveiled a slew of new features for its ecosystem of Google Assistant voice apps, called \"Actions,\" the company announced last week.  Google Assistant actions are similar to Amazon Alexa skills.  The new features \u2014 Custom Device Actions, push notifications, and support for media playback \u2014 could incentivize more developers to create actions for Google Assistantand drive consumer engagement, ultimately making Google Assistant a stronger competitor in the voice assistant landscape. That's because the more voice apps out there, the more useful \u2014 and appealing \u2014 the voice platform is for consumers.  Here are some of the new features for actions that Google is hoping will win over more voice developers:  Custom Device Actions to enable developers to implement native functionality that's specific to their devices. Currently, developers are limited to universal commands that Google implemented. But with Custom Device Actions, developers have the flexibility to extend Google Assistant to fully support their devices by adding their own custom actions. For example, a manufacturer of a smart dishwasher could add a command for an action that's not universal across other dishwashers, like \"start a hypercycle.\"  Currently, developers are limited to universal commands that Google implemented.

A new push notification API enables apps to send out alerts to users about the latest content available. Google is likely relying on notifications to bolster user retention and engagement, as they have been successful for smartphone apps. For example, push-enabled app users logged 53% more monthly sessions in mobile apps compared with users who hadn't engaged with a push message, according to Localytics.

Support for media playback and improved content carousels. Actions will now support media playback \u2014 such as meditation sessions, relaxing sounds, and clips from TV shows \u2014 on speakers and Android phones. Additionally, actions that are highly visual-based, such as those on smart speakers with display screens, can include a browse carousel that enables users to visually browse content (see below).  The new features will be key in bolstering user engagement and retention for Google Actions, which are two sore spots for voice app developers. One of the main issues with voice assistants is discoverability of voice apps \u2014 only 48% of smart speaker owners have used a third-party voice app, according to Voicebot.ai. And once they find a voice app, there's only a 6% chance that the user will continue using that voice app within two weeks, according to a September 2017 report from VoiceLabs. The new features could help to reduce the friction associated with voice app discovery and, in turn, drive engagement and retention.  Business Insider Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has written a detailed report on voice apps that explores the two major viable voice app stores. It identifies the three big issues voice apps are facing \u2014 discoverability, monetization, and retention \u2014 and presents possible short-term solutions ahead of industry-wide fixes.  Here are some of the key takeaways from the report:  The market for smart speakers and voice platforms is expanding rapidly. The installed base of smart speakers and the volume of voice apps that can be accessed on them each saw significant gains in 2017. But the new format and the emerging voice ecosystems that are making their way into smart speaker-equipped homes is so far failing to align with consumer needs.  Voice app development is a virtuous cycle with several broken components. The addressable consumer market is expanding, which is prompting more brands and developers to developer voice apps, but the ability to monetize and iterate those voice apps is limited, which could inhibit voice app growth.  Monetization is only one broken component of the voice app ecosystem. Discoverability and user retention are equally problematic for voice app development.  While the two major voice app ecosystems \u2014 Amazon's and Google's \u2014 have some Band-Aid solutions and workarounds, their options for improving monetization, discoverability, and retention for voice apps are currently limited.  There are some strategies that developers and brands can employ in the near term ahead of more robust tools and solutions.

Google was a big early investor in Uber.  Kalanick described his early relationship with Google founder Larry Page as little brother/big brother.  And then he discussed how it disintegrated as Google started to compete with Uber.  Uber's former CEO Travis Kalanick took the stand this week in San Francisco to defend Uber in a lawsuit brought by Waymo. Waymo, the self-driving car startup spun out of Google parent Alphabet, is suing Uber, alleging Uber stole its trade secrets. Uber contends it did not steal those trade secrets.  In some ways, this trial is like an ugly Silicon Valley divorce. Google was actually one of Uber's early big investors. Back in 2013, Google Ventures invested $258 million into Uber, which was its largest investment to date. Google senior vice president David Drummond also joined Uber's board.  \"We got an investment from Google. I was meeting with Larry Page. They picked me up in a self-driving car and I was like, 'that's pretty cool,'\" Kalanick testified, according to the live tweets from the trial by Recode's Johana Bhuiyan\u200f.  \"The general understanding is Google is doing this self driving thing. Uber is doing this ride share thing. Maybe we can partner up,\" Kalanick testified.  In those days, Kalanick looked up to Page and Drummond, he said.  \"It was kind of like little brother/big brother ... kind of hard to grok now. I looked at David Drummond and Larry Page kind of like big brothers ... maybe trying to get more time than they were trying to give.\"  But then Google grew increasingly interested in launching its own Uber competitor. Kalanick grew worried about Google's plans when its star self-driving engineer Chris Urmson was openly talking about creating a self-driving robot taxi fleet at the Detroit auto show in January 2015. Kalanick asked Drummond to set up a meeting with Larry Page about it, according to emails shared at the trial.  A few months later, an increasingly freaked out Kalanick asked for a meeting again, telling Drummond, \"A meeting with with Larry could calm this down if it's not true, but he has been avoiding any meeting with me since last fall. Without any dialogue, we get pushed into the assumption that Google is competing in the short term and has probably been planning to do so for quite a bit longer than has been let on.\"  Meanwhile, Kalanick wasn't waiting for that meeting. Uber had gone on a hiring binge of robotics engineers from Carnegie Mellon University.  When Kalanick did finally meet with Page, the two were already at odds, Kalanick testified, describing the meeting like this: \"Larry was fairly upset with us about us acquiring the CMU team ... He was sort of a little angsty and said 'why are you doing my thing?'\"  By August 2016, with the Waze carpooling service expanding in the Bay Area and Uber going fully into developing self-driving cars, Drummond left Uber's board, citing increasing conflicts of interest.  Later that month, Uber bought the self-driving truck startup of former star Google self-driving engineer Anthony Levandowski. Shortly after that, Waymo sued Uber.  Fast forward to the middle of 2017 and this lawsuit was one of the major reasons Kalanick lost his job as CEO of Uber last year, according to Benchmark, the investor that orchestrated his ousting.", "stock": "GOOGL", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-07", "source": "business-insider", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/travis-kalanick-thought-of-larry-page-like-a-big-brother-2018-2"}, {"article": "BI Intelligence  This story was delivered to BI Intelligence Apps and Platforms Briefing subscribers hours before appearing on Business Insider.

Google is aiming to make its Google Assistant voice platform more useful by enabling multi-step voice commands and more tightly integrating the assistant with smartphones and carriers, according to The Verge.  The forthcoming updates are aimed at giving developers, phone vendors, and wireless carriers the tools to create a more interactive user experience, reach more users, and create a more seamless voice assistant experience. These updates are expected to roll out in the coming weeks and throughout the year.  Here are some of the new tools and expanded features that Google is hoping will win over more consumers and voice developers:  Routine commands on the Google Home smart speaker. Smart home routines enable users to manage their connected devices with just a single voice command to Google Assistant. Saying \"Good morning\" to Google Assistant can simultaneously turn on the lights, increase the thermostat temperature, and begin outlining the user's day via Google Calendar, for example. The announcement comes on the heels of a similar offering from Amazon.  Google Assistant.

The announcement comes on the heels of a similar offering from Amazon. Expanded language support.Google Assistant will become available in over 30 languages by the end of the year, up from the eight languages it currently supports. This will enable Google Assistant to reach 95% of all active Android phones globally, according to Google VP of Product Nick Fox. Enabling Google Assistant to support more languages will help expand its global audience, and can spur usage of developers' apps.

This multilingual feature will initially only be available in English, French, and German, but is expected to expand to more languages over time. Deeper Assistant integration with phones and carriers. Google is working with smartphone vendors, starting with Xiaomi, LG, and Sony, to integrate Google Assistant with the specific hardware and software of smartphones. Users will be able to ask Google Assistant to launch a specific camera feature, issuing commands like, \"Hey Google, launch my camera's augmented reality mode,\" for example. Google is also working with wireless carriers, the first being Sprint, Vodafone, Telus, and Koodo, to integrate their services with Assistant. This could allow users to ask Google Assistant to check how much data is left on their monthly allotment, or even add more data to their plan.  The latest announcements could be key in helping Google bolster its voice assistant platform and spur adoption of the technology. A major challenge facing the overall voice assistant market is that most consumers rely on them to conduct simple tasks, like getting weather updates or setting timers, while complex and lengthy interactions lag. By creating new experiences that expand Google Assistant's ability to complete more complex tasks, the usefulness of the platform will increase, and engagement can grow as a result. As voice assistants become more intelligent, and developers create better and more useful ways to integrate them with consumers' lives, voice will cement itself as the primary way consumers interact with their devices.  Business Insider Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has written a detailed report on voice apps that explores the two major viable voice app stores. It identifies the three big issues voice apps are facing \u2014 discoverability, monetization, and retention \u2014 and presents possible short-term solutions ahead of industry-wide fixes.  Here are some of the key takeaways from the report:  The market for smart speakers and voice platforms is expanding rapidly. The installed base of smart speakers and the volume of voice apps that can be accessed on them each saw significant gains in 2017. But the new format and the emerging voice ecosystems that are making their way into smart speaker-equipped homes is so far failing to align with consumer needs.  Voice app development is a virtuous cycle with several broken components. The addressable consumer market is expanding, which is prompting more brands and developers to developer voice apps, but the ability to monetize and iterate those voice apps is limited, which could inhibit voice app growth.  Monetization is only one broken component of the voice app ecosystem. Discoverability and user retention are equally problematic for voice app development.  While the two major voice app ecosystems \u2014 Amazon's and Google's \u2014 have some Band-Aid solutions and workarounds, their options for improving monetization, discoverability, and retention for voice apps are currently limited.  There are some strategies that developers and brands can employ in the near term ahead of more robust tools and solutions.  In full, the report:  Sizes the current voice app ecosystem.  Outlines the most pressing problems in voice app development and evolution in the space by examining the three most damning shortcoming: monetization, discoverability, and retention.

The number given is a \"perfect number.\"  Google has a history of making mathematical references.  In its Q4 earnings report on Thursday, Google's parent company Alphabet announced plans to buy back some of its stock \u2014 $8,589,869,056 of stock to be exact.  There's a likely reason Google chose that specific value for their planned buyback: It's what mathematicians call a \"perfect number.\"  Perfect numbers are whole numbers with a fun property \u2014 they are the sum of all their proper divisors, or the whole numbers that evenly divide into the original number, except itself. The smallest perfect number is 6: 6 is divisible by 1, 2, 3, and itself. But then take those first three divisors and add them up, and you get 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.  8,589,869,056 is such a number. It has a few too many divisors to write out here \u2014 33 proper divisors in total \u2014 but the sum of its proper divisors does in fact come back up to itself.  In addition to their defining curious property, perfect numbers are relatively rare. They are closely connected to a certain class of prime numbers called Mersenne primes, or prime numbers that are one less than 2 raised to some prime number. Each even perfect number has a corresponding Mersenne prime.  Mersenne primes are interesting because it's relatively computationally easy to check whether a candidate Mersenne prime is in fact prime. Because of that, most of the largest prime numbers yet discovered are Mersenne primes, including the largest currently known prime number, 2 77,232,917 - 1.  Only 50 Mersenne primes have been found so far, which means because of their correspondence, only 50 perfect numbers are known so far. That makes Google's buyback choice quite a special number.  Google has a history of making mathematical references. In 2011, the company bid a multiple of pi in an auction for Nortel Networks' tech patents. Shortly after renaming itself Alphabet in 2015, the company announced a buyback in the amount of $5,099,019,513.59, which happens to be the square root of 26 x 10 18\u2014 26, of course, being the number of letters in the alphabet.

This little city was designed to show off all the different types of things the Google Assistant can do. Alex Wong/Getty Images  Google was aggressively pushing its Assistant at CES 2018, with a marketing blitz and a party with a performance by John Legend.  Google announced a bunch of new, key partnerships with companies including LG, Sony, and Lenovo to integrate with the Google Assistant.  However, Amazon's Alexa, and its line of Echo smart speakers, still dominate the market, with no signs of slowing down.  At last week's Consumer Electronics Show, the Google Assistant was inescapable.  There was a \"Hey Google\" ad on the side of the Las Vegas monorail, a reference to the magic words for invoking voice commands with the Google Assistant. The search giant also had a massive booth with a slide, which infamously got flooded out during an unseasonably intense storm on the first day of the show.  Indoors, many, if not most, of the internet-connected appliance vendors at the show boasted \"Works with Google Assistant\" emblems on their booth, or some variation. And then there was Google's CES party where John Legend performed for a very exclusive audience.  Google had some big news at the show, too: It was partnering up with companies including Lenovo, LG, and Sony to launch a line of Google Assistant-powered \"smart displays,\" which are basically just Google Home speakers with a screen. Plus, companies like Bose and LG are building Assistant into their headphones and TVs, respectively.  This was all clearly Google's way of striking back at Amazon Alexa, the market leader in this new category of voice-command devices.  Amazon was far and away the winner of last year's CES, with Alexa the star of many show-floor demonstrations. Google was at last year's CES, too, promoting its Google Home speakers. But all anybody wanted to talk about was Alexa.  At the 2018 show, Google Assistant grabbed the spotlight.  \"It is too early to measure the impact of Google's presence at CES, but they certainly made an impression,\" says Gartner Research Director Werner Goertz, who was at the show.  People lined up for hours at CES 2018 to try out this Google Assistant-powered vending machine, which dispensed prizes just for trying out the technology. Matt Weinberger/Business Insider  Indeed, Google has made great strides in catching up with Alexa in a very short time. The first Amazon Echo, which introduced Alexa, dropped in 2014. Google Home was released in late 2016, and within a year, had established itself as the most meaningful opponent to Alexa. I, personally, prefer Google Assistant to Amazon Alexa in my everyday life.  Google's \"smart displays\" are a direct answer to the Amazon Echo Show and Echo Spot, the first-ever Alexa devices with screens. And all of those new partner product integrations make the Google Assistant way more competitive with Alexa, which used its head start to establish itself as a dominant standard in the smart home.  This is all fine, as far as it goes. But the problem for Google as it rushes to play catch-up: Amazon hasn't stood still.  Amazon Echo is also getting better  First and foremost are the numbers; Amazon hints that Alexa products are outselling Google's. While Google says that it sold about 7 million Google Home speakers over the holiday season, Amazon said that it sold \"tens of millions\" of Alexa products over the same period. Without exact figures, it's hard to get a direct comparison, but the message is clear, and Google is lagging.  A big reason for that success is that Amazon keeps iterating and releasing new products. Just last year, Amazon released an all-new Echo, the Echo Plus home hub, the fashion camera Echo Look, the Echo Show, the Echo Spot, and even Echo Buttons, simple Bluetooth game controllers for the Echo.  Google, for comparison, released two new Home speakers, the $50 Mini and the $400 Max. And while Google claims the former is selling quite well, the latter is definitely more of a niche product for higher-end audiophiles (or wannabe DJs).  Those new Home products are good in their own right, but they're not as interesting as Amazon's Echo experiments. For instance, Amazon is playing around with new ways to interact with Alexa \u2014 the Echo Look camera helps you create a fashion look book for yourself; the Echo Plus streamlines the complicated process of adding smart home gear. Meanwhile, the Google Home Mini and Max are just variations on the same basic concept for a smart speaker that Amazon pioneered with the original Echo back in 2014.  Lots of companies were proudly promoting their Google Assistant integrations at CES 2018. Matt Weinberger/Business Insider  On the software side, both companies are getting better and at a fast rate. This is actually where Google shines, as its investments in artificial intelligence means that Google Home is getting better by the day at playing music, mapping a route, or even letting you know when a flight is cheap.  Gartner's Goertz lauds the progress Google has made with building out the Google Assistant ecosystem, but says there's still a ways to go, partnership-wise, to really catch up with Alexa.  Meanwhile, Amazon is making serious investments in turning Alexa into a platform. This year, as we previously reported, Amazon has big plans to start paying developers of the 30,000 Alexa \"skills,\" or apps, which could turn Alexa into an economy and ecosystem all on its own.  Google hasn't quite gotten to that point with Assistant yet, and so developers could well feel like there's a bigger incentive to stick with Alexa.  In short, Google is making serious inroads and has become the biggest roadblock to Amazon just completely running away with this young market. But Amazon is proving once again that it can move faster than its rivals. Google will have to pick up the pace if it wants to go beyond dominating CES, and into dominating the market.", "stock": "GOOGL", "label": 1, "date": "2018-01-21", "source": "business-insider", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/google-assistant-versus-amazon-alexa-2018-1"}, {"article": "Google Hangouts Chat on the PC web browser. Google  Google is finally releasing Hangouts Chat, its messaging app for business.  It's going right up against Microsoft Teams, Cisco Spark, and the $5 billion Silicon Valley startup Slack.  This is yet another attempt by Google to create a successful messaging platform. However, competition in this space is steep.  On Wednesday, Google is expected to make Hangouts Chat, its long-promised workplace chatroom tool for businesses, available to enterprise users of its G Suite productivity service. Google shared the news in a blog entry.  Hangouts Chat is available from the web browser, or from iOS and Android apps.  The service was first announced almost exactly a year ago, right alongside Hangouts Meet, a videoconferencing tool. Hangouts Meet has been available to the public for months, but Chat has so far only been available to a relative few G Suite customers in the Early Adopter Program.  Now, Hangouts Chat will go right up against some of tech's biggest guns. $5 billion startup Slack provides what many consider the gold standard in team communication software, while the similar Microsoft Teams is a key part of the Office 365 cloud productivity suite for businesses.

Like Slack and Microsoft Teams, Hangouts Chat supports chatbots.

You can also install bots that integrate with outside services, like Atlassian Jira or Salesforce CRM.

The feature will make it easier for people with access needs to get around.  It's launching in a handful of cities including New York, London, and Sydney, before rolling out more widely.  Google Maps is making a major change to help people with access needs: It's adding wheelchair-accessible routes to Google Maps.  When navigating cities, users will now be able to select \"wheelchair accessible\" as an option, and the app will show routes to the destination that the user should be able to navigate safely. It's similar to how you can already choose to request route with less walking or fewer transfers.  The news was announced on Thursday in a blog post by product manager Rio Akasaka.  \"In city centers, buses and trains are often the best way to get around, which presents a challenge for people who use wheelchairs or with other mobility needs. Information about which stations and routes are wheelchair friendly isn't always readily available or easy to find,\" he wrote.  \"To make public transit work for everyone, today we're introducing 'wheelchair accessible' routes in transit navigation to make getting around easier for those with mobility needs.\"  The feature is first launching in London, New York, Tokyo, Mexico City, Boston, and Sydney, and the company has plans to roll it out in other cities in the future.

A malfunction in Google's devices could cause WiFi routers to become overwhelmed and temporarily shut down.  TP-Link has confirmed the issue, and WiFi routers from other companies are also reportedly affected.  Several of Google's hardware devices, including the popular Chromecast video streaming dongle and the new top-of-the-line smart speaker, appear to suffer from a glitch that can temporarily freeze a consumer's home wireless network.  Numerous owners of the devices have recently reported experiencing WiFi network issues, and several tech blogs say Google is to blame.  On Tuesday, a maker of networking products by the name of TP-Link wrote in a blog post that its routers have been affected by Google devices that use the Google \"casting\" feature. The company said a glitch caused a WiFi network to become temporarily unresponsive or disconnect from other devices that were connected to the network.  WiFi routers from other companies, including Linksys, Asus, Netgear, and Synology are also reportedly affected.  It's not clear whether the problem stems from a flaw in Google's hardware, or whether it's the result of a broader software issue.  But the news represents the latest blow to Google's efforts to enter the hardware market, where it has limited experience and competes against longtime gadget makers like Samsung and Apple. In October, Google was forced to disable a button on the Home Mini smart speaker before the product even shipped due to a privacy problem.  Google \"casting\" devices come out of sleep mode and cause disruptions  According to TP-Link's blog post on the WiFi issue, the problems began in October 2017.  Google The company explained that under normal circumstances, Google's casting devices are designed to wake from a sleep state every so often to communicate with a WiFi router with small bits of data, called \"packets.\"  The problem is that some of Google's devices were malfunctioning and wouldn't rise out sleep mode for longer periods of time. When they did awake from their slumber, they flooded a WiFi router with huge amounts of data packets at a \"very high speed,\" which would overwhelm certain routers and cause the disruptions. The amount of data that would be sent to a WiFi router depended on how long a Google casting device was in sleep mode.  TP-Link has issued firmware updates for its affected WiFi routers, and a statement from Google to Engadget said \"We're aware that a small number of users are having issues and our team is working quickly to share a solution.\"  One of the ways to prevent WiFi network issues is to disable the casting feature in your Google casting devices. Of course, if the product is a Chromecast, that means you're effectively making the product useless.  Business Insider has contacted Google for comment, as well as a clarification of which devices can become affected, but the company hasn't yet replied.  There are several devices that support Google's casting feature, like smartphones, tablets, media streamers, and smart TVs. It's unclear if its specifically Google's own casting hardware causing the disruptions, or if it's Google's casting software feature found in several devices, too.", "stock": "GOOGL", "label": -1, "date": "2018-01-16", "source": "business-insider", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/google-casting-devices-causing-problems-home-wifi-networks-2018-1"}, {"article": "For search engines like Google, finding that one correct answer becomes particularly difficult when people have numerous parameters they want satisfied: Which vacuum cleaner is cheapest but also energy-efficient and good on thick carpets and won\u2019t scare the dog? To balance those competing preferences, you need a great vertical-search engine, which was something Adam and Shivaun had thought a lot about.  Photo  Soon the Raffs began daydreaming about turning their idea into a moneymaker. They didn\u2019t have the funds to compete with huge dating sites like Match.com, so they applied for a couple of patents and began brainstorming. They believed that their vertical-search technology was good \u2014 better, in fact, than almost anything they had seen online. Best of all, it was built to work well on almost any kind of data set. With just a bit of tinkering, it could search for cheap airline tickets, or great apartments, or high-paying jobs. It could handle questions with hard-to-compare variables, like what\u2019s the cheapest flight between London and Las Vegas if I\u2019m trying to choose between business class or leaving after 3 p.m.?  As far as they could tell, their search technology performed better on such problems than Google did, which Adam discovered when he tried to buy an iPod online. \u201cI spent half an hour searching Google for the lowest price, and it drove me completely mad,\u201d he told me. It was impossible for him to figure out which sites were selling iPods and which were selling accessories, like headphones or charging cords. Or Google would show Adam one price, but then the actual price was completely different. Or there was an extra charge for shipping. It seemed to Adam his technology would do a much better job.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Google executives, had they known of Adam\u2019s frustrations, probably wouldn\u2019t have been surprised. For years, Google had been trying to build a tool for comparing online prices. \u201cThe idea was you should be able to input any item, and we\u2019d show you the best place to buy it,\u201d says Brian Larson, a technical lead for what was then named Froogle and today is called Google Shopping. Larson\u2019s team was small \u2014 just himself and one other programmer at first, and roughly a dozen people at its height \u2014 and Larson would regularly test how Froogle compared with other online price-comparison services. \u201cSometimes we were neck and neck; sometimes, not so much,\u201d Larson said. \u201cWe had a hundred million product listings, which was better than competitors.\u201d But they were often outperformed by sites like PriceGrabber.com, which had many more employees devoted to price comparisons.  Froogle\u2019s limitations tended to pop up particularly when users included too many search parameters. For a while, Larson had a specific test search that Froogle kept failing, something like \u201cwhite running shoes and cheap and free shipping.\u201d Inevitably, the first result would be a Christmas elf wearing running shoes that some guy was selling online. No matter how Google\u2019s engineers fiddled with their coding, they couldn\u2019t stop the elf from appearing as the top link. Eventually, a manager bought the elf so it wouldn\u2019t appear in the search results anymore. \u201cWe made elf T-shirts,\u201d Larson told me. \u201cIt became our mascot.\u201d  Adam and Shivaun\u2019s technology was good enough to tell the difference between an elf wearing running shoes and an actual pair of running shoes. It was good enough, in fact, to figure out which websites charged hidden shipping fees and which offered truly good deals. So the Raffs quit their jobs, hired a few programmers, spent months perfecting their technology and, in early 2006, unveiled Foundem.com, a vertical-search engine for finding cheap online prices, to a small group of friends and associates. Each time someone used Foundem to buy something, the Raffs would receive a small payment from the website making the sale. Adam and Shivaun weren\u2019t sure their company would succeed \u2014 there were already a couple of other big price-comparison search engines, like PriceGrabber, NexTag and, of course, Google itself \u2014 but they figured this was how the internet was supposed to work: Two people with a new idea can take on giants and, if their technology is good enough, grow into colossi themselves.  The Raffs knew they would have to rely on Google to find customers. For one thing, as evidenced by the name Foundem, they weren\u2019t marketing geniuses. (\u201cIt\u2019s like we found \u2019em for you, you know?\u201d Shivaun explained.) But early tests indicated that Foundem usually came up high in Google\u2019s search results whenever people submitted queries like \u201ccompare prices xr-1000 motorcycle helmets.\u201d Six months later, they opened Foundem to the world, and initial traffic was encouraging. \u201cSearch engines liked the site,\u201d Shivaun told me. \u201cThat\u2019s supposed to be the recipe for success.\u201d As long as their vertical-search technology was strong, the Raffs figured, Google would guide shoppers to their door.  Google has succeeded where Genghis Khan, communism and Esperanto all failed: It dominates the globe. Though estimates vary by region, the company now accounts for an estimated 87 percent of online searches worldwide. It processes trillions of queries each year, which works out to at least 5.5 billion a day, 63,000 a second. So odds are good that sometime in the last week, or last hour, or last 10 minutes, you\u2019ve used Google to answer a nagging question or to look up a minor fact, and barely paused to consider how near-magical it is that almost any bit of knowledge can be delivered to you faster than you can type the request. If you\u2019re old enough to remember the internet before 1998, when Google was founded, you\u2019ll recall what it was like when searching online involved AltaVista or Lycos and consistently delivered a healthy dose of spam or porn. (Pity the early web enthusiasts who innocently asked Jeeves about \u201camateurs\u201d or \u201csteel.\u201d)  In other words, it\u2019s very likely you love Google, or are at least fond of Google, or hardly think about Google, the same way you hardly think about water systems or traffic lights or any of the other things you rely on every day. Therefore you might have been surprised when headlines began appearing last year suggesting that Google and its fellow tech giants were threatening everything from our economy to democracy itself. Lawmakers have accused Google of creating an automated advertising system so vast and subtle that hardly anyone noticed when Russian saboteurs co-opted it in the last election. Critics say Facebook exploits our addictive impulses and silos us in ideological echo chambers. Amazon\u2019s reach is blamed for spurring a retail meltdown; Apple\u2019s economic impact is so profound it can cause market-wide gyrations. These controversies point to the growing anxiety that a small number of technology companies are now such powerful entities that they can destroy entire industries or social norms with just a few lines of computer code. Those four companies, plus Microsoft, make up America\u2019s largest sources of aggregated news, advertising, online shopping, digital entertainment and the tools of business and communication. They\u2019re also among the world\u2019s most valuable firms, with combined annual revenues of more than half a trillion dollars.  In a rare display of bipartisanship, lawmakers from both political parties have started questioning how these tech giants grew so powerful so fast. Regulators in Missouri, Utah, Washington, D.C., and elsewhere have called for greater scrutiny of Google and others, citing antitrust concerns; some critics have suggested that our courts and legislatures need to go after tech firms in the same way the trustbusters broke up oil and railroad monopolies a century ago. But others say that Google and its cohort are guilty only of delighting customers. If these tech leviathans ever fail to satisfy us, their defenders argue, capitalism will punish them the same way it once brought down Yahoo, AOL and Myspace.  At the core of this debate is a question that is more than a century old: When does a megacompany\u2019s behavior become so brazen that it violates the law? In the early 1900s, just after the Industrial Revolution, the federal government provided an answer by suing one of America\u2019s largest companies, Standard Oil, on the novel theory that big becomes bad when a giant uses its dominance not only to defeat its competitors but also to extinguish the possibility that competition might occur.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  In its technological innovation, Standard Oil was the Google of its day. The company\u2019s founder, John D. Rockefeller, had become the richest man in America by spending millions of dollars hiring scientists to transform how oil was refined and transported. And those innovations earned the public\u2019s admiration. In 1858, before Standard Oil was founded, lighting a home required whale oil, which cost up to $3 a gallon, putting illumination out of reach for all but the wealthiest of households. By 1885, after Standard Oil figured out how to refine kerosene, it cost just 8 cents a gallon to brighten the night. \u201cLet the good work go on,\u201d Rockefeller wrote to a partner. \u201cWe must ever remember we are refining oil for the poor man and he must have it cheap and good.\u201d  Standard Oil\u2019s technological discoveries gave the company huge advantages over its rivals, and Rockefeller exploited those advantages ruthlessly. He cut secret deals with railroads so that other firms had to pay more for transportation. He forced smaller refineries to choose between selling out to him or facing bankruptcy. \u201cRockefeller and his associates did not build the Standard Oil Co. in the boardrooms of Wall Street,\u201d wrote Ida Tarbell, a muckraking journalist of the day. \u201cThey fought their way to control by rebate and drawback, bribe and blackmail, espionage and price cutting, and perhaps more important, by ruthless, never slothful efficiency of organization.\u201d  In 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt ordered his Justice Department to sue Standard Oil for antitrust violations. But government lawyers faced a quandary: It wasn\u2019t illegal for Standard Oil to be a monopoly. It wasn\u2019t even illegal to compete mercilessly. So government prosecutors found a new argument: If a firm is more powerful than everyone else, they said, it can\u2019t simply act like everyone else. Instead, it has to live by a special set of rules, so that other companies get a fair shot. \u201cThe theory was that competition is good, and if a monopoly extinguishes competition, that\u2019s bad,\u201d says Herbert Hovenkamp, co-author of a seminal treatise on antitrust law. \u201cOnce you become a monopoly, you have to start acting differently, and if you don\u2019t, then what you\u2019ve been doing all along starts breaking the law.\u201d  The Supreme Court agreed and split Standard Oil into 34 firms. (Rockefeller received stock in all of them and became even wealthier.) In the decades following the Standard Oil breakup, antitrust enforcement generally abided by a core principle: When a company grows so powerful that it becomes a gatekeeper, and uses that might to undermine competitors, then the government should intervene. And in the last century, as courts have censured other monopolies, academics and jurists have noticed a pattern: Monopolies and technology often seem intertwined. When a company discovers a technological advantage \u2014 like the innovations of Rockefeller\u2019s scientists \u2014 it sometimes makes that firm so powerful that it becomes a monopoly almost without trying very hard. Many of the most important antitrust lawsuits in American history \u2014 against IBM, Alcoa, Kodak and others \u2014 were rooted in claims that one company had made technological discoveries that allowed it to outpace competitors.  For decades, there seemed to be a consensus among policymakers and business leaders (though not always among targeted companies) about how the antitrust laws should be enforced. But around the turn of this century, a number of tech companies emerged that caused some people to question whether the antitrust formula made sense anymore. Firms like Google and Facebook have become increasingly useful as they have grown bigger and bigger \u2014 a characteristic known as network effects. What\u2019s more, some have argued that the online world is so fast-moving that no antitrust lawsuit can keep pace. Nowadays even the biggest titan can be defeated by a tiny start-up, as long as the newcomer has better ideas or faster tech. Antitrust laws, digital executives said, aren\u2019t needed anymore.  Consider Microsoft. The government spent most of the 1990s suing Microsoft for antitrust violations, a prosecution that many now view as a complete waste of time and money. When Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, Bill Gates, signed a consent decree to resolve one of its monopoly investigations in 1994, he told a reporter that it was essentially pointless for the company\u2019s various divisions: \u201cNone of the people who run those divisions are going to change what they do or think.\u201d Even after a federal judge ordered Microsoft broken into separate companies in 2000, the punishment didn\u2019t take. Microsoft fought the ruling and won on appeal. The government then offered a settlement so feeble that nine states begged the court to reject the proposal. It was approved.  What eventually humbled Bill Gates and ended Microsoft\u2019s monopoly wasn\u2019t antitrust prosecutions, observers say, but a more nimble start-up named Google, a search engine designed by two Stanford Ph.D. dropouts that outperformed Microsoft\u2019s own forays into search (first MSN Search and now Bing). Then those two dropouts introduced a series of applications, like Google Docs and Google Sheets, that eventually began to compete with almost every aspect of Microsoft\u2019s businesses. And Google did all that not by relying on government prosecutors but by being smarter. You don\u2019t need antitrust in the digital marketplace, critics argue. \u201cWhen our products don\u2019t work or we make mistakes, it\u2019s easy for users to go elsewhere because our competition is only a click away,\u201d Google\u2019s co-founder, Larry Page, said in 2012. Translation: The government ought to stop worrying, because no online giant will ever survive any longer than it deserves to.  Once Foundem.com was available to everyone, the company\u2019s honeymoon lasted precisely two days. During its first 48 hours, the Raffs saw a rush of traffic from users typing product queries into Google and other search engines. But then, suddenly, the traffic stopped. Alarmed, Adam and Shivaun began running diagnostics. They quickly discovered that their site, which until then had been appearing near the top of search results, was now languishing on Google, mired 12 or 15 or 64 or 170 pages down. On other search engines, like MSN Search and Yahoo, Foundem still ranked high. But on Google, Foundem had effectively disappeared. And Google, of course, was where a vast majority of people searched online.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  The Raffs wondered if this could be some kind of technical error, so they began checking their coding and sending email to Google executives, begging them to fix whatever was causing Foundem to vanish. Figuring out whom to write, and how to contact them, was a challenge in itself. Although Google\u2019s parent company bills itself as a diversified firm with about 80,000 employees, almost 90 percent of the company\u2019s revenues derive from advertisements, like the ones that show up in search. As a result, there are few things more important to Google\u2019s executives than protecting the firm\u2019s search dominance, particularly among the most profitable kinds of queries, such as those of users looking to buy things online. In fact, at about the same time the Raffs were starting Foundem.com, Google executives were growing increasingly concerned about the threats that vertical-search engines posed to Google\u2019s business.  \u201cWhat is the real threat if we don\u2019t execute on verticals?\u201d one Google executive emailed his colleagues in 2005, according to internal documents later shared with the Federal Trade Commission. \u201cLoss of traffic from Google.com because folks search elsewhere for some queries,\u201d he wrote, in answer to his own question. \u201cIf one of our big competitors builds a constellation of high-quality verticals, we are hurt badly,\u201d the internal documents continued. Another executive put it more bluntly: \u201cGoogle\u2019s core business is monetizing commercial queries. If users go to competitors such as Amazon to do product queries, long-term revenue will suffer.\u201d  Google executives began holding battle-plan meetings for the vertical war. Shortly after Foundem.com went online, one executive issued an order: Henceforth, Google\u2019s own price-comparison results should appear at the top of many search pages, as quickly as possible, even if that meant disregarding the natural results of the company\u2019s search algorithm. \u201cLong term, I think we need to commit to a more aggressive path,\u201d a high-ranking Google employee wrote to colleagues. Eventually, a mandate came from the chief executive: \u201cLarry thought product should get more exposure,\u201d a senior official wrote.  One way to get that exposure was to influence the rules governing how Google displayed search results. In 2006, Google instituted a shift in its search algorithm, known as the Big Daddy update, which penalized websites with large numbers of subpages but few inbound links. A few years later, another shift, known as Panda, penalized sites that copied text from other websites. When adjustments like these occurred, Google explained to users, they were aimed at combating \u201cindividuals or systems seeking to \u2018game\u2019 our systems in order to appear higher in search results \u2014 using low-quality \u2018content farms,\u2019 hidden text and other deceptive practices.\u201d  Left unsaid was that Google itself generates millions of new subpages without inbound links each day, a fresh page each time someone performs a search. And each of those subpages is filled with text copied from other sites. By programming its search engine to ignore other sites doing the same thing that Google was doing, critics say, the company had made it nearly impossible for competing vertical-search engines, like Foundem, to show up high in Google\u2019s results.  Shivaun and Adam sent email after email to Google executives, but no one responded with anything useful. So the Raffs started making phone calls. Those didn\u2019t help much, either. Adam and Shivaun had worked in technology for decades. They were well known and had connections to important people inside Google and at other big firms. But none of that seemed to matter.  As the months went by and Foundem\u2019s bank accounts dwindled, the Raffs, desperate, began approaching other websites, offering to adapt their technology to power those sites\u2019 internal search engines. Soon they were providing back-end technology for a popular motorcycle site and a large magazine publisher. Eventually, about 2.5 million people were seeing Foundem\u2019s search results each month. Foundem was named one of Britain\u2019s best travel comparison sites by The Times of London and celebrated on a popular British gadget show. But without traffic from Google, the Raffs were barely holding on.  Three years passed this way. Some nights, Shivaun would sit at her computer, exhausted, Googling phrase after phrase \u2014 How do you lift a Google website penalty? Who at Google reviews mistakes? Google and deindexed and phone number and help \u2014 hoping that some magic combination of words might yield a new solution. \u201cIt just felt so unfair,\u201d Shivaun told me. \u201cWe had great technology. It was winning awards. But we couldn\u2019t even get an explanation from Google about why we weren\u2019t showing up.\u201d Eventually, they sought out a public relations firm, in the hope that a newspaper article might get Google\u2019s attention. The P.R. firm had an additional suggestion: Why not file an antitrust complaint? To Adam and Shivaun, that seemed like a waste of time. If Microsoft had been able to shrug off the antitrust attacks of the United States government, why would Google care about a complaint filed by some small firm?  But they didn\u2019t see many other options. So Adam and Shivaun pulled out their laptops and began assembling a long document detailing everything they had experienced. Then they went to Brussels, to the headquarters of the European Commission, the agency charged with regulating competitive behavior, and filed a complaint accusing Google of violating antimonopoly laws.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  As the years passed, Shivaun and Adam got into the habit of visiting message boards where people obsessively discussed Google\u2019s many peculiarities. They began to notice an interesting pattern among companies complaining about the search giant: Often, the aggrieved parties had, in some way, posed some kind of threat to Google\u2019s business. And they seemed to have suffered dire consequences.  There was, for instance, Skyhook Wireless, which had invented a new navigation system that competed with Google\u2019s location software and had signed major deals with the cellphone manufacturers Samsung and Motorola. Skyhook\u2019s accuracy \u201cis better than ours,\u201d one Google manager speculated in an internal email later revealed in a lawsuit filed by Skyhook against Google. Not long after that note was written, according to the lawsuit, a high-ranking Google official pressured Samsung and Motorola to end their relationships with Skyhook \u2014 and implied that if they didn\u2019t, Google could make it impossible for them to ship their phones on time. (Google has denied doing anything inappropriate.) Soon, Samsung and Motorola canceled their Skyhook contracts. Skyhook sued Google, and though one suit was dismissed, Google ended up paying $90 million to settle a patent-infringement claim. But by then it was too late. Skyhook\u2019s founders, bereft of other partnership options, had been forced to sell their company at a large discount.  Then there was Yelp, a website with millions of user-generated reviews of local brewpubs, auto-body shops and other businesses. Yelp grew quickly as local queries \u2014 like \u201cbest nearby steakhouse\u201d \u2014 became a third of all online searches. For years, Yelp appeared near or at the top of millions of Google searches. Google, hoping to capitalize on that traffic, tried to buy Yelp in 2009, but Yelp\u2019s founders rejected those advances. Then Google started pulling Yelp\u2019s content into its own results, which meant many users didn\u2019t have to visit Yelp\u2019s website. Yelp complained \u2014 to Google and later to the F.T.C. \u2014 but Google said the only alternative was for Yelp to remove its content from Google altogether, according to documents filed with federal regulators. The same thing happened at other fast-growing review sites like TripAdvisor and Citysearch, which also complained to the F.T.C. \u201cWe still exist,\u201d says Luther Lowe, a vice president at Yelp, \u201cbut Google did everything it could to ensure that we\u2019d never present a threat to them. It\u2019s bullying, but they\u2019re the 800-pound gorilla.\u201d  The more Adam and Shivaun looked, the more examples they found. Getty Images had created a popular search engine to help users comb through the firm\u2019s 170 million photographs and other visual art. Then, in 2013, Google adjusted how it displayed images so that rather than directing people to Getty\u2019s website, users could easily see and download Getty\u2019s high-definition images from Google itself. \u201cOur traffic immediately fell 85 percent,\u201d says Yoko Miyashita, Getty\u2019s general counsel. \u201cWe wrote to Google, and said, Hey, this isn\u2019t cool. And their response was, \u2018Well, if you don\u2019t agree to these terms, we\u2019ll just exclude you\u2019 \u201d \u2014 by letting Getty remove itself from the search engine entirely, Miyashita said. \u201cThat\u2019s not really a choice, because if you aren\u2019t on Google, you basically don\u2019t exist.\u201d  TradeComet.com, which operated a vertical-search engine for finding business products, initially prospered by buying ads on Google, but as the site grew, Google \u201craised my prices by 10,000 percent, which strangled our business virtually overnight,\u201d the company\u2019s C.E.O. at the time, Dan Savage, said when he filed an antitrust lawsuit in 2009. KinderStart.com, a vertical-search engine for parents, sued Google after it received a \u201cPageRank\u201d of zero, making it essentially unfindable. (TradeComet.com\u2019s suit was dismissed on a technicality; KinderStart.com\u2019s was dismissed for insufficient evidence.)

Shivaun and Adam filled notepads with the names of companies that had complained about Google\u2019s tactics \u2014 eJustice, a vertical-search engine for legal information; NexTag, the fellow price-comparison site; BDZV, a group of German newspapers. They printed out lawsuits and regulatory complaints until their living room was a maze of paper.  Eventually the Raffs reached out to the F.T.C., which, they knew, was the American equivalent of the European Commission\u2019s antitrust office, and the U.S. regulators invited them to visit. The F.T.C.\u2019s staff, it turned out, had been quietly collecting complaints about Google for years. In 2012, those officials wrote a confidential 160-page report that said Google had \u201cadopted a strategy of demoting, or refusing to display, links to certain vertical websites in highly commercial categories.\u201d That memo, about half of which was accidentally sent to reporters at The Wall Street Journal after they submitted a Freedom of Information Act request, said that \u201cGoogle\u2019s conduct has resulted \u2014 and will result \u2014 in real harm to consumers and to innovation.\u201d  \u201cGoogle has strengthened its monopolies over search and search advertising through anticompetitive means,\u201d which \u201cwill have lasting negative effects on consumer welfare,\u201d F.T.C. officials wrote. They cited instances in which Google seemed purposely to be privileging less useful information, substandard search results and suboptimal links. \u201cAlthough it displays its flight search above any natural search results for flight-booking sites, Google does not provide the most flight options for travelers,\u201d the regulators wrote. Whereas a decade earlier someone searching for steakhouses would have seen a long list of websites, now the most noticeable results pointed to Google\u2019s own listings, including Google maps, Google local search or advertisers paying Google. Some F.T.C. staff recommended \u201cthat the Commission issue a complaint against Google\u201d for copying material and certain advertising and contract practices, though not search-engine bias.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Google responded to the report\u2019s claims by arguing that the changes it made to the search engine benefited users. \u201cOur testing has consistently showed that users want quick answers to their queries,\u201d Google said in a statement when contacted about this article. \u201cIf you are searching for weather, you probably want a forecast, not just links to weather sites.\u201d And when it comes to online shopping, the statement read, \u201cif someone is searching for products, they likely want information about price and where they can buy it. They probably don\u2019t want to be taken to another site where they have to enter their search again. . . . We absolutely do not make changes to our search algorithm to disadvantage competitors.\u201d Claims to the contrary, like those made by Foundem, are untrue, Google maintained. \u201cWe make hundreds of changes to search every year, all with the same goal: Delivering users the best, most relevant search results,\u201d the company continued. \u201cEach change, large and small, affects millions of sites, some who see their rankings improve, others who drop.\u201d And, Google concluded, \u201cour ultimate responsibility is to deliver the best results possible to our users, not specific placements for sites within our results.\u201d  When the F.T.C.\u2019s politically appointed leadership considered the staff\u2019s recommendations, they declined to sue Google, surprising many inside the agency. \u201cWhile not everything Google did was beneficial, on balance, we did not believe that the evidence supported an F.T.C. challenge,\u201d the agency\u2019s chairman at the time, Jon Leibowitz, said when he announced the decision in 2013.  The F.T.C.\u2019s decision, according to agency insiders, was motivated in part by a debate that has also sparked battles within antitrust courts over the last 40 years: Should the law protect consumers or encourage competition? They\u2019re not always synonymous. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t consumers who were complaining about Standard,\u201d says Hovenkamp, the antitrust scholar. \u201cIt was the other oil companies.\u201d Similarly, few users are kvetching about Google; it\u2019s primarily other tech firms. United States judges have increasingly held that the government must show consumer harm to win in court.  Adam and Shivaun didn\u2019t have to wait for the official F.T.C. announcement to know that their case was going nowhere. Meeting with officials in Washington, they could tell: These people were not going to prosecute. They had come to the United States at their own expense. They had written memo after memo arguing that Google was treating them unfairly and as a result hurting users. They had done everything they were asked. Standard Oil controlled 64 percent of the market for refined petroleum when the Supreme Court broke it into dozens of pieces. Google and Facebook today control an estimated 60 to 70 percent of the U.S. digital advertising market. And the F.T.C. seemed happy to let them keep doing it. To the Raffs, it felt as if history was repeating itself, as if the pointless, ineffectual Microsoft case was happening all over again. It felt as if nobody cared.  If you are younger than 29 \u2014 which just happens to be the average age of a Google employee, according to a survey done by PayScale \u2014 then odds are good you don\u2019t remember much about the Microsoft antitrust battles of the 1990s. So, a quick primer: For almost a decade, starting in 1993, federal and state prosecutors besieged Microsoft in courtrooms across the nation, arguing that the company had acted in ways that were predatory and dishonest to preserve its software monopoly. One Microsoft executive was quoted in court as threatening to \u201ccut off\u201d the \u201cair supply\u201d of a competitor. \u201cIs Bill Gates the \u201990s answer to Don Corleone?\u201d Time magazine asked. \u201cI expected to find a bloody computer monitor in my bed,\u201d a witness told investigators.  Along the way, Microsoft was accused of widespread bullying, coercion and general obnoxiousness. And Microsoft basically said: Whatever. \u201cThere\u2019s one guy in charge of licenses,\u201d Bill Gates told reporters after he signed a consent decree with the Department of Justice in 1994. \u201cHe\u2019ll read the agreement.\u201d Everyone else, the implication was, would ignore it.  Even when a judge ruled in 2000 that Microsoft was violating antitrust law, conventional wisdom held that the victory was largely pyrrhic. Microsoft successfully appealed, and prosecutors eventually threw in the towel, agreeing to abandon their attacks and settle if Microsoft agreed to token reforms, such as making its products more compatible with competitors\u2019 software and giving three independent observers unfettered access to the company\u2019s records, employees and source code. Microsoft\u2019s executives thought that three observers, versus 48,000 employees, sounded like pretty good odds.  This was the history the Raffs recalled when they heard the F.T.C. was abandoning its investigation. But then, they also remembered a discussion they had once had with a lawyer named Gary Reback, who told them that everything they\u2019d heard about the Microsoft trials was wrong. Reback is something of a legend in Silicon Valley, both because of his accomplishments as an antitrust provocateur and because of his anxious \u2014 some might say paranoid \u2014 worldview. Reback has been known to call other lawyers late at night and leave long, obsessively detailed voice mail messages about legal arguments and economic theories. He was featured on a 1997 cover of Wired magazine with the headline \u201cThis Lawyer Is Bill Gates\u2019s Worst Nightmare,\u201d a boast that wasn\u2019t far-off: Working on behalf of clients like Netscape and Sun Microsystems, Reback had browbeaten the Department of Justice into suing Microsoft for antitrust.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  By the time Adam and Shivaun started visiting the F.T.C., Reback had exchanged his antipathy of Microsoft for a disdain of Google and had accompanied them on their visits with regulators. There\u2019s a loose coalition of economists and legal theorists who call themselves the New Brandeis Movement (critics call them \u201cantitrust hipsters\u201d), who believe that today\u2019s tech giants pose threats as significant as Standard Oil a century ago. \u201cAll of the money spent online is going to just a few companies now,\u201d says Reback (who disdains the New Brandeis label). \u201cThey don\u2019t need dynamite or Pinkertons to club their competitors anymore. They just need algorithms and data.\u201d  Reback had told Adam and Shivaun that it was important for them to keep up their fight, no matter the setbacks, and as evidence he pointed to the Microsoft trial. Anyone who said that the 1990s prosecution of Microsoft didn\u2019t accomplish anything \u2014 that it was companies like Google, rather than government lawyers, that humbled Microsoft \u2014 didn\u2019t know what they were talking about, Reback said. In fact, he argued, the opposite was true: The antitrust attacks on Microsoft made all the difference. Condemning Microsoft as a monopoly is why Google exists today, he said.  Surprisingly, some people who worked at Microsoft in the 1990s and early 2000s agree with him. In the days when federal prosecutors were attacking Microsoft day and night, the company might have publicly brushed off the salvos, insiders say. But within the workplace, the attitude was totally different. As the government sued, Microsoft executives became so anxious and gun-shy that they essentially undermined their own monopoly out of terror they might be pilloried again. It wasn\u2019t the consent decrees or court decisions that made the difference, according to multiple current and former Microsoft employees. It was \u201cthe constant scrutiny and being in the newspaper all the time,\u201d said Gene Burrus, a former Microsoft lawyer. \u201cPeople started second-guessing themselves. No one wanted to test the regulators anymore.\u201d  In public, Bill Gates was declaring victory, but inside Microsoft, executives were demanding that lawyers and other compliance officials \u2014 the kinds of people who, previously, were routinely ignored \u2014 be invited to every meeting. Software engineers began casually dropping by attorneys\u2019 desks and describing new software features, and then asking, in desperate whispers, if anything they\u2019d mentioned might trigger a subpoena. One Microsoft senior executive moved an extra chair into his office so a compliance official could sit alongside him during product reviews. Every time a programmer detailed a new idea, the executive turned to the official, who would point his thumb up or down like a capricious Roman emperor.  In the early 2000s, Microsoft\u2019s top executives told some divisions that their plans would be proactively shared with competitors \u2014 literally describing what the company intended to create before software was even built \u2014 to make sure it wouldn\u2019t offend anyone who was likely to sue. Microsoft\u2019s engineers were outraged. But they went along with it.  And most important, as Microsoft lived under government scrutiny, employees abandoned what had been nascent internal discussions about crushing a young, emerging competitor \u2014 Google. There had been informal conjectures about reprogramming Microsoft\u2019s web browser, the popular Internet Explorer, so that anytime people typed in \u201cGoogle,\u201d they would be redirected to MSN Search, according to company insiders. Or, perhaps a warning message might pop up: \u201cDid you know Google uses your data in ways you can\u2019t control?\u201d  Microsoft was so powerful, and Google so new, that the young search engine could have been killed off, some insiders at both companies believe. \u201cBut there was a new culture of compliance, and we didn\u2019t want to get in trouble again, so nothing happened,\u201d Burrus said. The myth that Google humbled Microsoft on its own is wrong. The government\u2019s antitrust lawsuit is one reason that Google was eventually able to break Microsoft\u2019s monopoly.  \u201cIf Microsoft hadn\u2019t been sued, all of technology would be different today,\u201d Reback told me. We\u2019ve known since Standard Oil that advances in technology make it easier for monopolies to emerge. But what\u2019s less recognized is the importance of antitrust in making sure those new technologies spread to everyone else. In 1969 the Justice Department started a lawsuit against IBM for antitrust violations that lasted 13 years. The government eventually surrendered, but in an earlier attempt to mollify prosecutors, IBM eliminated its practice of bundling hardware and software, a shift that essentially created the software industry. Suddenly, new start-ups could get a foothold simply by writing programs rather than building machines. Microsoft was founded a few years later and soon outpaced IBM.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Or consider AT&T, which was sued by the government in 1974, fought in court for eight years and then slyly agreed to divest itself of some businesses if it could keep its most valuable assets. Critics complained AT&T was getting the deal of a lifetime. But then start-ups like Sprint and MCI made millions building on technologies AT&T championed, and AT&T found itself struggling to compete. It\u2019s completely wrong to say that antitrust doesn\u2019t matter, Reback argues. \u201cThe internet only exists because we broke up AT&T. The software industry exists because Johnson sued IBM.\u201d  It was critical that the Raffs continue fighting, Reback told them. Social embarrassment and sustained attacks have the power to succeed when courtrooms or political agencies fail. After their F.T.C. disappointment, the Raffs flew back to England to consider their options. And then one night they were at home watching television when the phone rang. Someone they had met in Brussels was calling to share some remarkable news. The European Commission had issued a decision on the complaint they filed six years before.  What changed everything was a middle-aged Danish politician named Margrethe Vestager, who had recently been named the European Union\u2019s commissioner for competition. Vestager was an unusual choice for the post. She wasn\u2019t a populist crusader or a pro-business acolyte; she was, instead, a moderate whose claim to fame, at that point, was having served as an inspiration for the television show \u201cBorgen,\u201d a fictional series about a Danish politician. But Vestager was awarded the commissioner\u2019s post in 2014 after arguing that European marketplaces needed to do a better job of giving everyone an equal chance to succeed. Since assuming her office, Vestager has become, unexpectedly, the most prominent antitrust official in the world, invited to speak at conferences and mobbed by autograph seekers.  By the time Vestager took office, Google had already transitioned its price-comparison service to its present incarnation, which is effectively an advertising system that prominently features links only from companies that pay for the promotion. (Users are notified by a small logo that says \u201csponsored.\u201d) After reviewing the complaints submitted by the Raffs and others, Vestager announced she intended to formally charge Google with antitrust violations. (She has also embarked on investigations into the European tax practices of Starbucks, Amazon and Apple, as well as anticompetitive tactics at Qualcomm, Facebook and Gazprom.)  Over the next two years, Vestager\u2019s staff reviewed data from 1.7 billion Google queries. They scrutinized how people fared when they conducted searches on topics in which Google had a vested interest, versus those where the company had nothing to gain. Then, in June of last year, the commission issued its final verdict: \u201cWhat Google has done is illegal under E.U. antitrust rules,\u201d Vestager said in a statement released at the time. \u201cIt denied other companies the chance to compete on the merits and to innovate. And most important, it denied European consumers a genuine choice of services and the full benefits of innovation.\u201d Google was ordered to stop giving its own comparison-shopping service an illegal advantage and was fined an eye-popping $2.7 billion, the largest such penalty in the European Commission\u2019s history and more than twice as large as any such fine ever levied by the United States.  The verdict rocked Silicon Valley. Some think Europe\u2019s assertiveness makes it more likely American regulators will act as well. And there\u2019s evidence that\u2019s already starting. Donald Trump appealed to voters, in part, by attacking the tech monopolies. In a case of truly odd bedfellows, that puts him in alignment with Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, who have long called for greater scrutiny of technology companies. Last year, a group of Democratic lawmakers in Congress, led by Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, sponsored legislation to boost antitrust enforcement by forcing companies to assume the burden of showing that a merger won\u2019t hurt the public.  Meanwhile, a bipartisan assortment of state attorneys general have urged the F.T.C. to reopen its investigation of Google. Most major antitrust battles, including the federal suits against Microsoft and Standard Oil, have begun as state actions. A Missouri investigation is particularly notable because the state\u2019s Republican attorney general, Josh Hawley, who is running for the United States Senate, has subpoenaed information to see if Google has manipulated searches to disadvantage potential competitors. \u201cThe Obama-era F.T.C. did not take any enforcement action against Google, did not press this forward and has essentially given them a free pass,\u201d Hawley told reporters after revealing his inquiry in November. \u201cI will not let Missouri consumers and businesses be exploited by industry giants.\u201d  As attacks against Google have escalated, the company has tried to limit the damage. After Yelp complained to the F.T.C. about Google\u2019s stealing its content, Google promised to make it easier for websites to opt out of automatic copying, a pledge it reaffirmed a few months ago. And earlier this month, in exchange for Getty Images\u2019 withdrawing its complaint to the European Commission, Google signed a licensing agreement with Getty promising to more clearly display images\u2019 copyright information. Other titans like Facebook are similarly trying to get ahead of criticisms, voluntarily pledging greater transparency and promising to work more cooperatively with regulators.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  The implication is clear enough: Google and the other tech titans understand that the landscape is shifting. They realize that their halos have become tarnished, that the arguments they once invoked as a digital exception to American economic history \u2014 that the internet economy is uniquely self-correcting, because competition is only a click away \u2014 no longer hold as much weight. \u201cWhen you get as big as Google, you become so powerful that the market bends around you,\u201d Vestager told me. The notion that antitrust law isn\u2019t needed anymore, that we must choose between helping consumers or spurring competition, no longer seems sufficient reason to exempt the tech giants from century-old legal codes. If anything, Vestager\u2019s verdict and state investigations indicate that companies like Google may have more in common with the monopolists of old than most people thought. Silicon Valley\u2019s bigwigs ought to be scared.  \u201cIf Europe can prosecute Google, then we can as well,\u201d says William Kovacic, a law professor and former Republican-appointed chairman of the Federal Trade Commission. \u201cIt\u2019s just a question of willingness now.\u201d  If the internet\u2019s potentates are frightened, however, they\u2019re doing a good job of hiding it. Google has appealed the European Commission\u2019s decision and has vigorously defended itself online. The company\u2019s arguments are the same ones that it was putting forth on company blogs over the course of the investigation. \u201cWe disagree with the European Commission\u2019s argument that our improved Google Shopping results are harming competition,\u201d Google\u2019s top lawyer wrote in one post. The commission \u201cdrew such a narrow definition around online shopping services that it even excluded services like Amazon,\u201d undermining the contention that Google is dominant. \u201cGoogle delivered more than 20 billion free clicks to aggregators over the last decade,\u201d he wrote in another post. Forcing it to \u201cdirect more clicks to price-comparison aggregators would just subsidize sites that have become less useful for consumers.\u201d Google\u2019s data indicates that users appreciate how the search engine has shifted over the years. \u201cThat\u2019s not \u2018favoring\u2019 \u201d Google\u2019s interests, the company said. \u201cThat\u2019s giving customers and advertisers what they find most useful.\u201d  Some legal theorists think that Google might have a point. \u201cTo what extent are consumers, rather than competitors, being harmed by Google?\u201d says Hovenkamp, the antitrust scholar. \u201cIf the answer is \u2018not much,\u2019 then I\u2019m suspicious of an antitrust remedy.\u201d Others say the risks are too high. \u201cThere are very real costs associated with suing a company like Google,\u201d says Geoffrey Manne, executive director of the International Center for Law & Economics, a nonpartisan research center. \u201cYou\u2019re potentially impairing a firm that provides vital services to millions of people, and potentially benefiting competitors who don\u2019t deserve that support.\u201d  Those are fair arguments. But they are also, in some ways, beside the point. Antitrust has never been just about costs and benefits or fairness. It\u2019s never been about whether we love the monopolist. People loved Standard Oil a century ago, and Microsoft in the 1990s, just as they love Google today.  Rather, antitrust has always been about progress. Antitrust prosecutions are part of how technology grows. Antitrust laws ultimately aren\u2019t about justice, as if success were something to be condemned; instead, they are a tool that society uses to help start-ups build on a monopolist\u2019s breakthroughs without, in the process, being crushed by the monopolist. And then, if those start-ups prosper and make discoveries of their own, they eventually become monopolies themselves, and the cycle starts anew. If Microsoft had crushed Google two decades ago, no one would have noticed. Today we would happily be using Bing, unaware that a better alternative once existed. Instead, we\u2019re lucky a quixotic antitrust lawsuit helped to stop that from happening. We\u2019re lucky that antitrust lawyers unintentionally guaranteed that Google would thrive.  Put differently, if you love technology \u2014 if you always buy the latest gadgets and think scientific advances are powerful forces for good \u2014 then perhaps you ought to cheer on the antitrust prosecutors. Because there is no better method for keeping the marketplace constructive and creative than a legal system that intervenes whenever a company, no matter how beloved, grows so large as to blot out the sun. If you love Google, you should hope the government sues it for antitrust offenses \u2014 and you should hope it happens soon, because who knows what wondrous new creations are waiting patiently in the wings.  For the Raffs, however, it\u2019s probably too late. By the time Vestager announced her verdict and record-setting fine last year, it had been 12 years since Adam and Shivaun started Foundem.com. During that time, their lives slowly but inexorably became devoted to battling Google. They had spent thousands of hours corresponding with regulatory agencies across the globe. They had filed a civil suit against Google in British court, a case that is ongoing. They basically shut down Foundem, creating more time for them to give advice to other companies and regulators fighting Google. This consulting work, some of which was funded by Google\u2019s competitors, has helped to keep the Raffs afloat. And if the Raffs win their lawsuit against Google, it could be worth millions. \u201cBut it\u2019s a different business model than we expected,\u201d Adam told me. \u201cIt\u2019s also deeply frustrating, because we became technologists in order to build new technologies. We never intended to be professional plaintiffs or antitrust crusaders.\u201d  One of the most difficult things for the Raffs over the past decade has been figuring out how to explain this journey to themselves and others. Even friends and family didn\u2019t fully understand what was going on. \u201cIt feels really good to be validated like this, to be told we were right,\u201d Shivaun told me, referring to Vestager\u2019s verdict. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t turn back the clock and give us another chance. Even if we win in Brussels, or win our lawsuit, in some ways, we were still defeated. We were still beaten by Google.\u201d", "stock": "GOOGL", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-20", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/20/magazine/the-case-against-google.html"}, {"article": "Q.

But sometimes, there is no substitute for good old human labor. With Google\u2019s new service, humans must label the data before the system can learn from it. Google can provide the human labelers, as do companies like CrowdFlower.  And even when an online service successfully automates a task, it\u2019s not necessarily worth using.  James Bradley and his London company, NMT Vision, once used Clarifai to train and operate algorithms to identify websites that are selling products that infringe on copyrights. But he and his company now handle this on their own, mainly because the cost is lower.  Services like DataRobot and H20.ai may bill themselves as automated data scientists, but here, too, automation has its limits. \u201cThese services are only as good as their parts,\u201d said Patrick Dougherty, a data scientist with the Seattle-based firm Slalom Consulting. \u201cAnd humans still supply some of the parts.\u201d  Google says that once images are labeled, its new service operates without human involvement. In a matter of minutes, it can retrain an existing algorithm using the customer\u2019s images. Given more time, it can build a model from scratch, specifically for the problem at hand.  If you are a zoologist who wants an algorithm that identifies jaguars and giraffes, said Fei-Fei Li, chief scientist inside the Google cloud group, all you have to do is supply the right images. \u201cYou upload jaguars and giraffes,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you are done.\u201d  All that remains is determining how well it works.", "stock": "GOOGL", "label": 1, "date": "2018-01-17", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/17/technology/google-sells-ai.html"}, {"article": "Q.

But when American Express appealed, the Second Circuit reversed, relying on a new concept to create a special set of rules. The concept is that players in \u201ctwo-sided\u201d markets are unique because they serve different sets of customers in distinct but related markets, effectively facilitating transactions. American Express, for example, charges both merchants who accept its cards and consumers who use them. Using this concept, the Second Circuit held that the government would have to show that any price increases for merchants also harmed cardholders, or at least didn\u2019t benefit them. In effect, the court introduced a dramatically new rule, making it much more difficult to win important antitrust cases and to stop anticompetitive behavior.  The case is now at the Supreme Court. If affirmed, the Second Circuit decision would create de facto antitrust immunity for the most powerful companies in the economy. Since internet technologies have enabled the growth of platform companies that serve multiple groups of users, firms like Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Uber are set to be prime beneficiaries of the Second Circuit\u2019s warped analysis. Amazon, for example, could claim status as a two-sided platform because it connects buyers and sellers of goods; Google because it facilitates a market between advertisers and search users. (An industry trade group representing the tech platforms filed an amicus brief in support of American Express.) Indeed, the reason that the tech giants are lining up behind the Second Circuit\u2019s approach is that \u2014 if ratified \u2014 it would make it vastly more difficult to use antitrust laws against them.  The fact that the tech platforms could effectively be shielded from antitrust is troubling because, in several respects, these firms enjoy dominant market positions that makes antitrust scrutiny of their conduct especially important. By virtue of providing increasingly critical services, tech giants wield immense leverage over the sellers and buyers that rely on their platforms. This power is ripe for abuse. If the Supreme Court ratifies the Second Circuit\u2019s approach, platforms will be able to engage in anticompetitive activity with one set of users, so long as they can plausibly claim that harmful conduct enabled them to benefit another group. Say, for example, that Uber prohibited its drivers from also serving rivals like Lyft, suppressing driver income. Under the current approach, these exclusive agreements would likely violate antitrust law. But under the Second Circuit\u2019s analysis, the case would go nowhere unless plaintiffs could show that this practice also harmed riders.  This danger is compounded by the slipperiness of the concept underlying this analysis: the idea of a \u201ctwo-sided\u201d market. While reports paid for by the credit card industry introduce \u201ctwo-sided\u201d markets as a novel concept that requires special analysis, markets serving different groups of users have been around for centuries. They include, for example, grain futures exchanges (connecting farmers and buyers of farm products), banking (linking depositors and borrowers) and newspapers (serving advertisers and readers). For decades, courts have recognized that anticompetitive conduct imposed by a newspaper on readers, for example, is no less illegal if it can be shown to benefit advertisers.  Indeed, almost all markets can be understood as having two sides. Firms ranging from airlines to meatpackers could reasonably argue that they meet the definition of \u201ctwo-sided,\u201d thereby securing less stringent review.", "stock": "GOOGL", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-02", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/02/opinion/the-supreme-court-case-that-could-give-tech-giants-more-power.html"}, {"article": "The resilience of misinformation, despite efforts by the tech behemoths to eliminate it, has become a real-time case study of how the companies are constantly a step behind in stamping out the content.

The difficulty of dealing with inappropriate online content stands out with the Parkland shooting because the tech companies have effectively committed to removing any accusations that the Parkland survivors were actors, a step they did not take after other recent mass shootings, such as last October\u2019s massacre in Las Vegas. In the past, the companies typically addressed specific types of content only when it was illegal \u2014 posts from terrorist organizations, for example \u2014 Mr. Morgan said.

The companies have said they are betting big on artificial intelligence systems to help identify and take down inappropriate content, though that technology is still being developed.  The companies have in the meantime hired or said they plan to hire more people to comb through what is posted to their sites. Facebook said it was hiring 1,000 new moderators to review content and was making changes to what type of news publishers would be favored on the social network. YouTube has said that it plans to have 10,000 moderators by year\u2019s end and that it is altering its search algorithms to return more videos from reliable news sources.

The sites have automated detection systems that often search for specific terms or images that have previously been deemed unacceptable. So to evade those systems, people sometimes can alter images or switch to different terminology.  Sam Woolley, an internet researcher at the nonprofit Institute for the Future, said far-right groups had started using internet brands to describe minorities \u2014 like \u201cSkype\u201d to indicate Jewish people \u2014 to trick software and human reviewers.  Those who post conspiracy theories also tend to quickly repost or engage with similar posts from other accounts, creating a sort of viral effect that can cause the sites\u2019 algorithms to promote the content as a trending topic or a recommended video, said David Carroll, a professor at the New School who studies tech platforms.  That duplication and repackaging of misinformation \u201cmake the game of snuffing it out Whac-a-Mole to the extreme,\u201d he said.  That game played out across the web in the past few days, after a video suggesting that one of the most vocal Parkland survivors, David Hogg, was an actor became the No. 1 trending video on YouTube.

A new wave of artificial intelligence, including services like Google Assistant, are driven by \u201cneural networks,\u201d which are complex algorithms that can learn tasks on their own by analyzing vast amounts of data. By analyzing a database of old customer support phone calls, for example, a neural network can learn to recognize commands spoken into a smartphone. But this requires serious computing power.  Typically, engineers train these algorithms using graphics processing units, or G.P.U.s, which are chips that were originally designed for rendering images for games and other graphics-heavy software. Most of these chips are supplied by Nvidia.  In designing its own A.I. chips, Google was looking to exceed what was possible with these graphics-oriented chips, speed up its own A.I. work and lure more businesses onto its cloud services.  At the same time, Google has gained some independence from Nvidia and an ability to negotiate lower prices with its chip suppliers.  \u201cGoogle has become so big, it makes sense to invest in chips,\u201d said Fred Weber, who spent a decade as the chief technology officer at the chip maker AMD. \u201cThat gives them leverage.

The companies have also been accused by lawmakers, critics and activists of monopolistic tendencies and manipulative product design.

In some ways, the complaints from the right about Big Tech mirror the grumblings of legacy news organizations, which have expressed concern that online algorithms wield too much power over how readers gain access to their content.  Jeffrey A. Zucker, the president of CNN, derided Google and Facebook as \u201cmonopolies\u201d and called for regulators to step in during a speech in Spain last month, saying the tech hegemony is \u201cthe biggest issue facing the growth of journalism in the years ahead.\u201d And former President Barack Obama said at an off-the-record conference at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology last month that he worried Americans were living in \u201centirely different realities\u201d and that large tech companies like Facebook were \u201cnot just an invisible platform, they\u2019re shaping our culture in powerful ways.\u201d The contents of the speech were published by Reason magazine.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  In the right\u2019s more internet-savvy quarters, tech platforms have been a regular \u2014 and fruitful \u2014 subject of discussion since before the 2016 election. In May that year, Facebook was forced to respond to claims that the curators of its Trending Topics feature had suppressed conservative news sources, a controversy that called attention to Facebook\u2019s editorial power.  That charge of editorial bias was echoed last weekend by Alex Jones, the conspiracy theorist behind Infowars, who accused YouTube of planning to delete his organization\u2019s account, a claim that was widely shared among conservatives.  YouTube did delete some videos that accused teenage survivors of the Parkland, Fla., school shooting of being \u201ccrisis actors,\u201d and it issued \u201cstrikes,\u201d or warnings, to the accounts of Infowars and Jerome Corsi, a conservative author and Infowars contributor. (YouTube denied that it had plans to delete the Infowars account.)  Facebook has also caught flak for adjusting the algorithm for its News Feed to emphasize posts from \u201cfriends, family and groups\u201d over content from public pages. The change was part of an effort by the company to answer criticism, but also to reinvigorate its oldest and most profitable product, which recently recorded a decline in American daily users for the first time in its history.  The Facebook adjustment has affected virtually every media organization that is partly dependent on the platform for audiences, but it appears to have hit some harder than others. They include right-wing sites like Gateway Pundit and the millennial-focused Independent Journal Review, which was forced to lay off staff members last month.  The social news giant BuzzFeed recently bought ads on Facebook with the message, \u201cFacebook is taking the news out of your News Feed, but we\u2019ve got you covered,\u201d directing users to download its app. Away from the political scrum, the viral lifestyle site LittleThings, once a top publisher on the platform, announced last week that it would cease operations, blaming \u201ca full-on catastrophic update\u201d to Facebook\u2019s revised algorithms.  Right-wing media has pounced. In late February, citing statistics from the social analytics firm NewsWhip, Breitbart published an article on the effects on the president\u2019s Facebook page with the headline \u201cEXCLUSIVE: Trump\u2019s Facebook Engagement Declined By 45 Percent Following Algorithm Change.\u201d The drop, the article insinuated, occurred \u201cfollowing a year of pressure from left-wing employees and the mainstream media for \u2018allowing\u2019 the president to win the 2016 general election.\u201d  Still, the brewing backlash did not stop Google and Facebook from courting the very crowd that now seems ready to declare them enemies.

Google, which has co-sponsored CPAC three of the past six years, held a lavish reception for attendees featuring an open bar and a roaring outdoor fireplace.

It agreed to use the new Jaguar I-Pace, a battery-powered hatchback unveiled this month, for the service announced Tuesday. After testing, the company expects to start its ride service by the end of the year.  Mr. Krafcik, the Waymo chief, said the company intended to move forward rapidly with a driverless ride service for the public because it was confident its vehicles could operate safely in virtually any driving situation where they would be put into use. In addition to the five million miles its cars have driven in tests, Waymo has run computer simulations equivalent to five billion miles of testing. In these computer models, Waymo uses software to make virtual test drives even more complicated by adding more pedestrians and making distances between cars shorter than in typical road situations, he said.  At a closed site in California, Waymo also tests the performance of its cars in traffic situations based on actual crashes. \u201cWe think we will be the safety benchmark for the world,\u201d said Mr. Krafcik, who worked in operations at Ford and then was Hyundai\u2019s United States chief before his arrival at Waymo.  He noted that Waymo cars were equipped with highly sensitive cameras, radar and three different types of lidar \u2014 a kind of radar based on lasers \u2014 to identify objects, pedestrians and other cars.  Even with the vast computing power of Google, which operates giant data centers around the world, Waymo won\u2019t be able to train its computerized \u201cdriver\u201d to be prepared for everything. \u201cThere are going to be things we can\u2019t predict,\u201d Adam Jonas, an automotive analyst at Morgan Stanley, said at the J.

Elaine Herzberg, 49, was walking her bicycle across the road at a spot without a crosswalk when she was struck. Videos taken by cameras mounted in the Uber vehicle show the safety driver was looking down just before the impact.  The Uber crash prompted Toyota to suspend testing its self-driving cars on public roads as a precaution, although Ford Motor and General Motors said they were proceeding with their efforts.

It wants to develop self-driving technology that it can put into cars made by partners, and intends to operate them in a ride service.  Waymo also expects to put its technology into trucks and delivery vehicles, as well as buses or other vehicles that ferry riders to mass transportation systems. And it hopes to license the technology to carmakers, auto technology suppliers or other companies.

Two former Google workers allege as much in a class-action lawsuit they filed against the company last week. While they may have difficulty prevailing in court, they make a strong case that Google aggressively promotes a political agenda and is far from a neutral broker of information.  Former Google engineers James Damore and David Gudeman claim they were fired for failing to conform to the company\u2019s progressive culture. Last summer Mr. Damore published what was initially an internal cri de coeur against Google\u2019s \u201cideological echo chamber\u201d that criticized its intolerance for alternative views and suggested biology may make men better suited, on average, for tech jobs. Many Google employees demanded Mr. Damore\u2019s termination and a purge of those who shared his views. Senior managers allegedly told Mr. Damore that he was fired for \u201cperpetuating gender stereotypes.\u201d  Mr. Gudeman was fired after he questioned a Muslim co-worker who claimed he was being targeted by the federal government because of his religion. According to the lawsuit, Google claimed Mr. Gudeman had accused the colleague of terrorism.  Messrs. Damore and Gudeman claim to be victims of sex, race and political discrimination. Discrimination in employment on the basis of race, sex, national origin and religion are prohibited by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. But federal law doesn\u2019t forbid employers to discriminate based on their political or cultural views. So the plaintiffs are suing under California labor law, which prohibits employers from \u201cforbidding or preventing employees from engaging or participating in politics.\u201d Employers also cannot discharge or threaten to terminate employees to coerce them into political action.  To win certification as a class action, the plaintiffs must demonstrate that numerous Google employees suffered a common injury. To win their case, they\u2019ll have to show that Google itself adopted or enforced a policy that forbade employees from engaging in politics and led to systematic discrimination against white, conservative men\u2014or alternatively that Google fired Messrs. Damore and Gudeman to force employees to adopt progressive views.  Google\u2019s likely defense will be that it pledges to \u201ccreate a respectful culture that is free of harassment, intimidation, or unlawful discrimination of any kind,\u201d and that the firing of Messrs. Damore and Gudeman was in furtherance of this policy. But the plaintiffs make a good case that Google has selectively and unfairly enforced its policy, and in doing so has promoted a hostile workplace.  Mr. Damore alleges that after he and some co-workers complained about Google\u2019s ideological conformity and diversity training\u2014\u201cbias busting\u201d seminars on \u201cwhite male privilege\u201d and the like\u2014they were shunned, denounced and punished. One manager sent out a mass email describing Mr. Damore\u2019s memo as \u201crepulsive and intellectually dishonest\u201d and allegedly \u201cpromoted posts that advocated for physical violence\u201d against him. A co-worker emailed Mr. Damore: \u201cYou\u2019re a misogynist and a terrible person. I will keep hounding you until one of us is fired. [Expletive] you.\u201d Mr. Damore says he forwarded the email to the human-resources department and was told to work from home. He was fired soon after. Another manager allegedly threatened to ask Google\u2019s employee-relations department to sift through old posts on Google\u2019s \u201cconservatives@\u201d mailing list for code-of-conduct violations.  The plaintiffs also include nearly 100 pages of employee postings on Google\u2019s chat system that disparage conservatives as well as white men. Several employees circulated a meme asserting that \u201c \u2018America First\u2019 is a slogan for American Nazis\u201d and \u201cyou should absolutely punch Nazis.\u201d  Others posted: \u201cIf you want to increase diversity at Google, fire all the bigoted white men\u201d and \u201cby being a white male you are in a privileged class that is actively harmful to others.\u201d One described Mr. Damore and his supporters as \u201ca cancer within our culture.\u201d Many demonstrated an animus toward Christianity\u2014for instance: \u201cPeople in Indiana are bigots, but they don\u2019t call it bigotry. What do they call it? Religious freedom.\u201d  Managers allegedly maintained \u201cblacklists\u201d of conservatives who were blocked from working on their teams, which thwarted their advancement. One manager who blacklisted an intern because he refused to alter his political views allegedly wrote to a fellow manager: \u201cI don\u2019t think he was aware that there were real consequences for his actions. That might have given him the right motivation to change his beliefs or at least to keep his mouth shut.\u201d  According to the lawsuit, Google \u201crelies on crowdsourced harassment and \u2018pecking\u2019 to enforce social norms (including politics) that it feels it cannot write directly into its policies.\u201d It\u2019s as if the company were using machine learning to program its employees\u2019 politics.  Even if Google prevails in the lawsuit, it may consider whether this is any way to run a business. Ideological uniformity can undermine the ability to connect with disparate consumers and generate innovative ideas. That\u2019s especially true for a company like Google, whose founding mission was to make information \u201cuniversally accessibly and useful.\u201d People with divergent political views may have different ideas about what information is useful.  Silencing alternative views and sheltering employees from uncomfortable ideas, as many colleges do, will surely undermine Google\u2019s own ability to attract creative thinkers. Employee intolerance might have also contributed to its subsidiary YouTube\u2019s censorship in 2016 of conservative PragerU videos. And the Daily Caller reported last week that the search engine was providing selective and inaccurate \u201cfact checks\u201d for conservative, but not liberal, sites.

Photo: Richard B. Levine/Zuma Press  One problem the brilliant minds at Google have yet to solve: How to beat Amazon.com AMZN -1.22% at its own game.  It isn\u2019t for a lack of trying. Over the last couple of years, the internet search giant has aggressively built up its own cloud-computing business and pumped out its own line of smart speaker products\u2014two relatively new businesses that have been wildly successful for Amazon. And that hasn\u2019t been without some success on Google\u2019s part. Its cloud-computing arm is now generating more than $1 billion in revenue every quarter. And its Home line of smart speakers now has about 31% of the U.S. market, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners.  But investors are lukewarm on Google at best. Such was evident on Friday, when the shares of parent company Alphabet Inc. GOOGL -0.12% slid 5% in the wake of its fourth-quarter results, though that only wiped out gains made since the first of the year. By contrast, Amazon\u2019s own results helped its stock defy the market\u2019s brutal selloff to gain nearly 3% for the day\u2014having already run up 17% for the year. For Alphabet, the main issue for investors is the rising costs that Google has to pay partners to direct traffic to its sites. Those traffic acquisition costs totaled $21.6 billion in 2017\u2014up 29% from the previous year. That outpaced the 20% revenue growth for Google\u2019s core advertising business for the year, which weighs on the company\u2019s profitability. Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat noted that the growth rate of these costs should start to moderate early this year. But profitability isn\u2019t why investors favor the retailer over the search engine. Google\u2019s $26.1 billion of operating income last year is about 40% more than Amazon has earned in its entire existence. Nor is it the propensity to make big gambles. The difference is that Amazon has figured out how to make more of its big gambles, such as Prime and its AWS cloud service, drive its accelerating growth. Since 2010, Amazon\u2019s larger revenue base has averaged 28% growth annually while Alphabet\u2019s has averaged 21%. In textbook investing, profits matter over revenue growth, but that doesn\u2019t always hold in tech. Investors won\u2019t return to Google just because it is so profitable. Instead, the company can emphasize successful new businesses like the cloud and better articulate how its ubiquitous Android mobile operating system contributes to growth. If it can do that while keeping its wildly profitable core business clicking, Google can catch up to its rival. Amazon wants to deliver everything you want to your doorstep, anywhere in the world. But the e-commerce giant faces several challenges in its pursuit of a global empire. WSJ's Karan Deep Singh breaks down the basics with the help of an Amazon delivery box.

Get past the absurdity of his framing his grievance in terms of identity politics\u2014he\u2019s a victim of Google\u2019s failure to honor \u201cviewpoint diversity.\u201d Apparently under California law this is a legitimate claim.  Last year\u2019s firing episode at first seemed a case of Google clumsily suppressing dissent over race and gender policies adopted after the company\u2019s workforce was found to be overwhelmingly white and male. Now it seems like something else.  If the postings and emails cited in Mr. Damore\u2019s lawsuit are a reliable indication, founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page have lost control of the culture. Google\u2019s leaders may even be a little afraid of their employees.  Mr. Damore\u2019s firing last year by CEO Sundar Pichai certainly rang of panic at the time. Google explicitly invites freewheeling discussion and provides internal forums for it. Mr. Damore did not, in his famous memo, object to Google\u2019s diversity goals. His ruminations on biology may be jejune, but unwelcome facts are still facts. Witness the work of David Lubinski at Vanderbilt, which goes a long way toward explaining the recruiting frustrations of many a tech and engineering-based company. Prof. Lubinski and colleagues find that women who are gifted in math and science tend to be broadly gifted, and consequently have lots of opportunities in a wide range of fields, whereas men with math talents tend to be narrowly gifted, and all end up in math-science-engineering fields.  Not that Mr. Damore\u2019s lawsuit, in which he is joined by another recently fired male engineer, turns on the validity of his Darwinian musings. In the postings and emails he quotes, colleagues spew hate at Mr. Damore, apparently without consequence.  We see them giving each other employee-awarded \u201cpeer bonuses,\u201d supported by Google\u2019s \u201cRecognition Team,\u201d for denouncing him. We see Google employees explicitly reject talking to, listening to or working with colleagues whose politics they don\u2019t share.  We see them proposing blacklists. One paints as incapable of coming up with anything \u201ccreative or innovative\u201d any meeting consisting of \u201c40-something white men,\u201d and Google HR approves the sentiment. An employee asks if \u201cmen\u201d were changed to \u201cwomen,\u201d would the post still be approved? No response.  Another posting calls on Googlers to decline to participate in industry panels alongside \u201ccheesy white males.\u201d  One Googler who says he refuses to \u201ctolerate\u201d broad categories of people (e.g., Trump voters) might seem regrettable, especially after it turns out he\u2019s German and lives in Switzerland. When it becomes a competition, a cultural disease is at work. Incipient here is a world that people in Google\u2019s home state are already familiar with. It\u2019s the world of California\u2019s maximum-security prison system, where inmates survive only by kneeling to one identity-based gang or another.  If there is a lesson here for other companies\u2014and don\u2019t take this the wrong way\u2014it\u2019s the value, broadly, of \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell.\u201d  To work together on software, people don\u2019t need a company-supplied forum to discuss their politics, their sexual interests, their cultural antipathies. Offering it seems pointlessly divisive.  Perhaps the most symbolically disturbed posting is one demanding that control of Google be wrested from the \u201chorde of racist and sexist people we\u2019ve already hired.\u201d  To be white and male is not to be sexist and racist. The statement \u201cI don\u2019t want to be denied an opportunity because of my gender and race\u201d is as valid for a white male as it is for a black, gay, female or furry. (Yes, Google\u2019s internal discussion board includes consideration of the \u201cfurry\u201d lifestyle, which involves dressing up in animal costumes.)  Some predict Google will quickly settle to avoid discovery of more emails and postings, including from top management. What seems worse, from a public-relations perspective, is a culture inveterately hostile to the liberal principle \u201cI may disagree with what you say but defend your right to say it.\u201d This can\u2019t be good in a business whose mission is to organize the world\u2019s information.  Messrs. Brin, Page and Pichai likely feel a tad helpless. The U.S. legal system imposes a need to be race-aware, gender-aware, etc.\u2014to require quotas in all but name, since quotas are illegal. Google simultaneously faces lawsuits and regulatory investigations directed at its alleged shortchanging of women on pay and promotions.  Its internal mood may also partly be a victim of self-esteem run amok. It\u2019s a wonder many Googlers don\u2019t worship Donald Trump \u2014he also can\u2019t tolerate to be disagreed with. A good, old-fashioned Presbyterian horror of self-righteousness, once a feature of American life, is nowhere to be seen.  Part of growing up is learning to live with your emotions; today\u2019s shortcut is to believe whatever your feelings are, they\u2019re justified. Humanity never met a dictator or demagogue who said, \u201cI\u2019m a bad person. I want to do bad things.\u201d The worst among us always feel justified.", "stock": "GOOGL", "label": -1, "date": "2018-01-16", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/of-furries-and-fascism-at-google-1516144969"}, {"article": "Riyadh, Saudi Arabia  Since Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman announced his intention to transform this country nearly two years ago, Saudis and foreigners alike have questioned whether he is serious or merely enjoying power. The time for doubt is over. Last week\u2019s news that Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, is in talks to build a tech hub in the kingdom is only the latest sign. Look for more such initiatives when the crown prince visits the U.S. in early March.  Whatever one may think about Saudi Arabia or its new young strongman, there is no longer any dispute as to his resolve. Prince Mohammed is determined not just to reform the country but to wrench Saudis out of a 30-year torpor that he rightly sees as inexorably leading them toward poverty and instability. The radical change he is imposing isn\u2019t a choice: It is the only choice.  He has inherited a nation of 22 million spoiled children, each of whom wants a cushy life in the national nursery that oil-rich Saudi Arabia used to be. But with crude oil crashing to $26 a barrel in 2016\u2014and even now at almost $70 a barrel\u2014Riyadh can no longer afford the pacifiers to tranquilize its population, not to mention the 10 million foreign workers who have tended to Saudi citizens\u2019 every need.  Prince Mohammed\u2019s Saudi Vision 2030 is a push away from dependence on government and toward self-reliance. To jump-start the transformation, he has instituted social changes no one could have imagined only a few years ago: Saudis are now free to attend concerts and cinemas, and in June women will be driving, all of which were previously forbidden by religious authorities backed by royal rulers.  More significantly, Prince Mohammed has rounded up prominent people accused of financial corruption\u2014royal cousins, cabinet ministers, businessmen\u2014and forced them to turn over what the government says will be $106 billion in exchange for their freedom.  These are shocking tactics in a country accustomed to royal rule through laborious consensus-building among the senior princes. But the truth is that most of these senior princes are now dead. More to the point, that unwieldy method of governance failed for 30 years to wean the country off oil dependence, despite repeated commitments to that end. Prince Mohammed knows the folly of doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result.  Almost since the founding of modern Saudi Arabia in 1932, its stability has rested on three pillars: unity among the royals, their symbiotic cooperation with the Wahhabi religious establishment, and oil wealth. The new crown prince has upended each of these pillars\u2014arresting and humiliating his royal relatives, insisting on moderate Islam and a more open society, and imposing high taxes on the cheap oil that Saudis regard as their birthright.  During my January visit, Saudis were in shock at the social, political and economic changes. In a single week last month, electricity prices tripled, gasoline prices doubled (to roughly $2 a gallon), and the first-ever value added tax, of 5%, was imposed. If asked Ronald Reagan\u2019s famous 1980 debate question\u2014\u201cAre you better off than four years ago?\u201d\u2014almost all Saudis over 30 would say \u201cno.\u201d  The arrests of elite princes and businessmen, as well as conservative religious sheikhs, have chilled older Saudis. During my visit, more than one old acquaintance declined to meet me for \u201chealth\u201d reasons and other polite excuses. But Prince Mohammed\u2019s constituency is not the royal family or the religious sheikhs. It\u2019s the 70% of Saudis who are under 30. He essentially is playing generational Robin Hood\u2014taking from the elite who for decades helped themselves to the nation\u2019s oil revenues, while freeing the young from the smothering hand of Wahhabi sheikhs who sapped Saudi initiative by controlling every aspect of daily life. The crown prince clearly hopes that if citizens are allowed to manage their lives, they will take responsibility for their livelihoods.  This is a brave gamble, but without significant change Saudi Arabia\u2019s future looks dark. The economy is growing more slowly than the population. Domestic oil consumption is rising nearly 6% a year, a trend that would leave Saudis consuming all the Kingdom\u2019s oil production\u2014with none left for export\u2014by 2030. The economy shrank 0.5% last year and is estimated to grow only 1.6% in 2018, according to the International Monetary Fund, though the Saudi government projects faster growth of 2.7%. The official unemployment figure is 12.7% nationally, but it\u2019s nearly double that for men between 20 and 29 and 33% for young women in that age group.  Prince Mohammad\u2019s economic transformation represents a huge task. If that isn\u2019t enough, he also confronts a hegemonic and meddling Iran, a feud with Qatar, and a war in Yemen. Knowing the price Saudi Arabia has paid for decades of dithering, the crown prince has dared to impose rapid top-down change. Inevitably he will make some mistakes. Those he can repair. More troublesome is that some Westerners whose investment and support he seeks may insist on seeing Saudi Arabia as stuck like a fossil in its past Wahhabism and limited personal freedoms. While the Saudis are far from perfect on human rights, the West should acknowledge that the recent progress is real.  The biggest risk remains the economy: It is far from clear that Prince Mohammed can transform the country fast enough to meet the pent-up ambitions of young Saudis. The West has a stake in doing what it can to assure his success. A collapse that turns Saudi Arabia into another chaotic Iraq or theocratic Iran would be a disaster for the region and the world. Right now, the young prince with his agenda for radical change is Saudi Arabia\u2019s best, and probably only, shot at moderate\u2014and modernizing\u2014reform.

They do\u2014more than ever. The problem is that the money generated by news audiences flows mostly to Google and Facebook , not to the reporters and publishers who produce excellent journalism.  The Duopoly now captures 83% of all digital ad revenue growth and 73% of U.S. digital advertising, according to a CNBC report. As a result, newspapers\u2019 online audience growth does not produce revenue to match. According to data from Pew, newspaper advertising revenue fell from $22 billion in 2014 to $18 billion in 2016 even as web traffic for the top 50 U.S. newspapers increased 42%.  Local news is most at risk. As print circulation declines, community news publishers have the hardest time adapting to the ever-changing demands of Facebook and Google algorithms. We think of \u201cfake news\u201d as a national phenomenon, but in the absence of a workable news business model, wild rumors and conspiracy theories could become more influential at the local level, too.  Tech savvy, digital-only publishers are also struggling. BuzzFeed CEO Jonah Peretti said in December that Google and Facebook are \u201cpaying content creators far too little for the value they deliver to users,\u201d and that \u201cthis puts high-quality creators at a financial disadvantage, and favors publishers of cheap media.\u201d  A user launches the Facebook app on his phone. Photo: Elise Amendola/Associated Press  Google and Facebook have become the primary and de facto regulators of the news business, and governments around the world are starting to recognize the danger. British Prime Minister Theresa May announced earlier this month that her government would review the economics of internet news consumption. Regulators in Germany, Israel and South Korea are investigating how Google\u2019s business practices have disrupted the media market and harmed publishers and consumers. U.S. regulators, on the other hand, have rarely looked into Google or Facebook\u2014and never at their influence in the news marketplace.  Some voices on the left and right are calling for Google and Facebook to be regulated as utilities. But there is an easier solution: exempt news publishers from certain aspects of antitrust regulation.  U.S. antitrust laws, designed to promote fair competition and prevent consolidation, actually make it harder for traditional news outlets to compete with Silicon Valley giants. Under current law, for instance, news publishers cannot get together and agree to withhold their product unless they receive a return on their investment. Let\u2019s start by changing that simple inequity. News publishers should be able to use their collective leverage in negotiations with big tech.  Rep. David Cicilline, top Democrat on the House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee, is expected to introduce a bill to do that next week. The Journalism Competition and Preservation Act of 2018 is a low-regulation, pro-market way to unleash the news industry\u2019s negotiating power. If antitrust enforcers can\u2019t protect society from the outsize influence of modern-day trusts, the least the government can do is get out of the way and let publishers protect themselves and their readers.

Photo: baz ratner/Reuters  Google is following Facebook \u2019s FB 0.40% lead by banning ads for cryptocurrencies and other \u201cspeculative financial products\u201d across its advertising platforms.  Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google said the new policy will become effective in June across ads bought on its search and display-advertising network, as well as its YouTube unit. The policy also will restrict ads for nontraditional methods of wagering on the future movements of stock prices and foreign-exchange, such as binary options and financial spread-betting, Google said.  Facebook updated its ad policy to ban ads for similar financial products on Jan. 30.  The rise in popularity and price of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies has led to scammers using online ads to promote fraudulent cryptocurrency schemes via online ads. One new tool in the scammer\u2019s arsenal is so-called crypto-jacking, or putting lines of code in websites or ads to surreptitiously harness the computing power of the web surfers who look at them. The power is used to mine cryptocurrency, a digital form of money that has no government or central-bank printing it or standing behind it. Google said last year it removed more than 130 million ads that were used by hackers to mine for cryptocurrency. That is a very small percentage of the ads run on Google\u2019s ad network. The company\u2019s director of sustainable ads, Scott Spencer, declined to comment on how much potential ad revenue the company would be turning away by enacting the new policy, saying the decision was made to prevent consumer harm. The company has long banned ads promoting counterfeit goods or dangerous products, such as weapons or recreational drugs. Financial regulators are taking a close look at the multibillion-dollar U.S. market for raising funds in cryptocurrencies, raising questions about how these assets may be regulated in the future. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission warned earlier this month that cryptocurrency exchanges risk being deemed illegal because they don\u2019t disclose how they determine what currencies can be bought and sold on their sites. In addition to its cryptocurrency ad-policy announcement, Google said in a blog post published Wednesday that it took down more than 3.2 billion ads that violated its wider policies in 2017, such as those that attempted to send people to sites loaded with malware or phishing scams. The company said it removed 1.7 billion bad ads in 2016. Some bad ads did get through its defenses\u2014which comprise a combination of technology and thousands of human content reviewers\u2014but Mr. Spencer said those that slipped through the net can be measured in the hundreds, as opposed to the billions. Overall, Google said it removed 320,000 publishers from its ad network for violating its various publisher policies in 2017, while about 90,000 websites and 700,000 mobile apps were blacklisted.

Google executives were among the most influential voices on its committees and helped steer its decision making to favor its own ad formats, the people said.  Google began conducting research on what types of ads consumers found most annoying in 2015. The following year, Google executive Scott Spencer met with advertising and publishing executives to gather support for a new initiative that would essentially curb the role played by ad blockers, according to people who were present.  In the meetings, Mr. Spencer proposed blacklisting certain types of ads, the people said. The ad standards could be voluntarily adopted by industry groups, or even enforced by browsers or ad-blocking software, he said. Executives were asked to sign nondisclosure agreements barring them from discussing the meetings.  Venable LLC, a Washington-based law firm, was hired by three ad trade groups including Interactive Advertising Bureau to set up and manage the coalition, said the firm\u2019s chairman Stuart Ingis.  Soon after the coalition was established, it voted to adopt Google\u2019s research, Mr. Ingis said. Google had surveyed consumers on dozens of ad formats and ranked them by how \u201cannoying\u201d they found each one. Long, skinny rectangles on the side of the screen were found the least annoying; full-screen messages with countdown timers were among the most annoying.  The coalition worked with Google to improve the research, including deciding on a number of additional ad formats to test, said one person involved in the process. Google tested 55 desktop ad formats and 49 mobile formats and presented the findings to the group.  The coalition ultimately deemed 12 ad formats unacceptable.  Google\u2019s leading role in the standard-setting process troubled some of the coalition\u2019s members, who observed that the blacklisted ad formats generally don\u2019t apply to Google\u2019s own business, according to people who were part of the process. Google generates most of its revenue from text search ads and rectangular display ads, rather than the visually rich media ads that will be banned by the coalition.  \u201cThey are creating a standard that doesn\u2019t apply to them,\u201d said Ryan McConville, president of mobile-ad startup Kargo, one of 17 members on the coalition\u2019s board.  Some of the members lobbied the coalition to make exceptions, including Facebook, which argued that the social network should be excluded from a rule banning videos that automatically play with sound. Bounce Exchange Inc., a pop-up ad maker, argued the pop-up ad rule should be changed to exclude ads that appear when a user is idle for more than 30 seconds. Both efforts were successful.  Google didn\u2019t test one of its own most prominent ad formats, the ads that run on YouTube videos for several seconds before users can skip them.  The Google spokeswoman said the coalition plans to test video ads in the future. Some of Google\u2019s own ads are likely to be blocked by Chrome since non-compliant sites will have all ads blocked, she added.  Mr. Spencer said Google has given ample warning to the affected publishers. He said that less than 1% of the web\u2019s most visited sites\u2014under 1,000 of them\u2014are currently out of compliance with the rules.  \u200bGoogle handles 90% of the world's internet searches, and it increasingly is promoting a single answer for many questions. Even subjective or unanswerable queries sometimes get seemingly definitive answers. Here's how the algorithms are -- and aren't -- working.

We\u2019re back after taking a short break over the Easter weekend. The Villanova Wildcats stormed to victory against the Michigan Wolverines to win their second college basketball championship in three seasons Monday night. TBS\u2019s ad sales team was probably celebrating, too. The average cost for a 30-second spot during the game ranged between $1.4 million and $1.7 million, a 3% jump over last year, according to media-research firm SQAD.  Plenty of popcorn-grabbing moments over the past few days as our tech overlords took potshots at each other. Apple CEO Tim Cook threw some barbs in Facebook\u2019s direction last week during a taping of an MSNBC interview with Recode\u2019s Kara Swisher slated to air April 6. Mr. Cook called for more privacy regulation and said he\u2019d never be in the same situation Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is currently in because Apple\u2019s business model relies on the sale of devices and services users, rather than essentially selling users to advertisers. Mr. Zuckerberg fired back in a must-read interview with Vox\u2019s Ezra Klein, saying Mr Cook\u2019s comments were \u201cextremely glib and not at all aligned with the truth.\u201d The killer quote: \u201cIt\u2019s important that we don\u2019t all get Stockholm syndrome and let the companies that work hard to charge you more convince you that they actually care more about you.\u201d Sharing\u2019s caring!  \u2014Chickity Check Yo Self Before You Wreck Yo Self\u2014  You\u2019ll remember Facebook last week said it was curbing the information it exchanges with data brokers and shutting down its \u201cPartner Categories\u201d ad targeting tool. Now changes are coming to Custom Audiences, where marketers upload their own customer data lists in order to target them with ads across Facebook\u2019s platform. TechCrunch reported Facebook is building a more prominent permission tool for advertisers to certify they have permission to use the data they\u2019re uploading and that it\u2019ll prevent the sharing of Custom Audiences data between different Business Manager accounts. Facebook\u2019s policies always stated that advertisers should have consent for the data they\u2019re uploading, but by making those terms more obvious it\u2019s hoping to prevent the kind of illicit data sharing we saw in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. And, like everyone else, Facebook\u2019s also preparing for the EU\u2019s new General Data Protection Regulation that goes into effect in May. Meanwhile, in a similar vein, Facebook-owned Instagram has suddenly limited how much data some developers can collect from its API, Recode reported.  The Magic Number  Google-owner Alphabet reports its quarterly earnings on April 23, but this time it\u2019s different, Bloomberg reports. Google has long tracked the amount of money it makes from ads using \u201ccost-per-click,\u201d a metric that\u2019s closely watched by analysts. That makes a lot more sense on search than on the network of third-party sites it sells ads across because most advertisers tend to buy display and video ads based on impressions rather than clicks. So, in Q1, Alphabet will report on percentage changes in impressions and cost-per-impressions metrics for its Network business. Speaking of impressions, YouTube is launching a new \u201cTrueView\u201d ad product that advertisers will pay for on an impression (CPM) basis, even if users skip at the five-second mark, Ad Age reports. What\u2019s the sell here? The blog post announcing \u201cTrueView for Reach\u201d suggests that brands that are good at getting their message across in just a few seconds can potentially reach more people and drive down their CPMs.  Laura, Can\u2019t You Give Me Some Time  Fox News has responded to advertisers\u2019 withdrawals from \u201cThe Ingraham Angle\u201d over a tweet by the show\u2019s host, Laura Ingraham, that mocked Parkland shooting survivor David Hogg. Ms. Ingraham, who apologized, is now off on a scheduled vacation and due to return next Monday, according to Fox News Co-President Jack Abernethy. Mr. Abernethy said in a statement, \u201cWe cannot allow voices to be censored by agenda-driven intimidation efforts,\u201d reports the Los Angeles Times. As the Wrap reported, \u201cThe Ingraham Angle\u201d had just 7 minutes of paid commercial time on Friday, down from an average of 14 minutes 33 seconds between January 1 and March 28, according to data from Kantar Media. The show lost five of its top 20 advertisers: Bayer, Hulu, Johnson & Johnson, Liberty Mutual and Wayfair. What\u2019s not clear is whether the network is taking a financial hit or whether advertisers have simply shifted to other Fox News shows. A source told Variety that Fox News is accommodating sponsors who want to move their ads elsewhere in the schedule. (Reminder: Fox News parent 21st Century Fox and Wall Street Journal parent News Corp share common ownership.)  Sumnertime Blues  CBS and Viacom are advancing in their merger talks. So who will have the final say on whether to do a deal? Sumner Redstone, the 94-year-old mogul whose health has declined so badly that he can\u2019t speak much beyond grunts, is still the most powerful figure, in theory \u2014 with an 80% voting interest in National Amusements, the holding company that itself owns nearly 80% voting stakes in Viacom and CBS. But WSJ\u2019s Keach Hagey has new details on the current chain of command: National Amusements updated its bylaws in 2016 to make clear that Mr. Redstone had a single vote among seven NAI directors in decisions tied to the Viacom and CBS stakes. That move, meant to clarify procedures partly due to questions about Mr. Redstone\u2019s mental capacity, hasn\u2019t previously been disclosed. Mr. Redstone\u2019s holding still gives him the power to replace NAI board members. A decision on whether to combine Viacom and CBS could come as soon as this month. And as Reuters first reported, CBS is close to making an all-stock offer that values Viacom below its current stock price.  Best of the rest  21st Century Fox said Tuesday it could sell British TV channel Sky News to Disney in order to ease the passage of its bid to acquire the 61% of Sky it does not already own. Its other proposed remedy is to establish Sky News as a separate company within the bigger Sky group, with an independent board and a 15-year funding guarantee.

The monopolies of old and of today were built on proprietary technology and physical networks that drove down costs while locking in customers, erecting formidable barriers to entry. Just as Standard Oil and AT&T were once critical to the nation\u2019s economic infrastructure, today\u2019s tech giants are gatekeepers to the internet economy. If they\u2019re imposing a cost, it may not be what customers pay but the products they never see.  In its youth Standard Oil was as revered for its technological and commercial brilliance as any big tech company today. John D. Rockefeller began with a single refinery in Cleveland in 1863 and over the next few decades acquired other, weaker refineries. Those that wouldn\u2019t sell, he underpriced and drove out of business. By 1904, companies controlled by Standard Oil produced 87% of refined oil output, according to Mike Scherer, a retired Harvard economist who has written extensively on antitrust.  This wasn\u2019t superficially bad for consumers. The price of kerosene, the principal refined product from oil, fell steadily as Standard Oil\u2019s market share expanded, thanks to falling crude oil prices and Standard Oil\u2019s economies of scale, bargaining power with suppliers such as railroads, and innovation, such as the Frasch-Burton process for deriving kerosene from high-sulfur oil in Ohio.  Standard Oil's refinery in Richmond, Calif., in 1911. Photo: Library of Congress/Corbis/VCG/Getty Images  When the federal government sued to break up Standard Oil, the Supreme Court acknowledged business acumen was important to the company\u2019s early success, but concluded that was eventually supplanted by a single-minded determination to drive others out of the market.  In a 2005 paper, Mr. Scherer found that Standard Oil was indeed a prolific generator of patents in its early years, but that slowed once it achieved dominance. Around 1909 Standard\u2019s Indiana unit invented \u201cthermal cracking\u201d to improve gasoline refining to meet nascent demand from automobiles, but the company\u2019s head office thought the technology too dangerous and refused to commercialize it. After the Indiana unit was spun off when the company was broken up in 1911, it commercialized the technology to enormous success, Mr. Scherer wrote.  Big Spenders Top tech companies owe their market position in part to heavy investment in new products and technology. R&D spending as a share of revenue Intel 21.5% Facebook 21.2% Alphabet  15.5%  Microsoft  13.8%  Johnson & Johnson  12.5%  Amazon*  11.8%  Apple  5.1%  General Motors  4.9%  General Electric  4.0%  Procter & Gamble  2.9%  AT&T  1.0%  Exxon Mobil  0.5%  The story of AT&T is similar. It owed its early growth and dominant market position to Alexander Graham Bell\u2019s 1876 patent for the telephone. After the related patents expired in the 1890s, new exchanges sprung up in countless cities to compete.  Competition was a powerful prod to innovation: Independent companies, by installing twisted copper lines and automatic switching, forced AT&T to do the same. But AT&T, like today\u2019s tech giants, had \u201cnetwork effects\u201d on its side.  \u201cJust like people joined Facebook because everyone else was on Facebook, the biggest competitive advantage AT&T had was that it was interconnected,\u201d says Milton Mueller, a professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology who has studied the history of technology policy.  Early in the 20th century, AT&T began buying up local competitors and refusing to connect independent exchanges to its long-distance lines, arousing antitrust complaints. By the 1920s, it was allowed to become a monopoly in exchange for universal service in the communities it served. By 1939, the company carried more than 90% of calls.  Though AT&T\u2019s research unit, Bell Labs, became synonymous with groundbreaking discoveries, in telephone innovation AT&T was a laggard. To protect its own lucrative equipment business it prohibited innovative devices such as the Hush-a-Phone, which kept others from overhearing calls, and the Carterphone, which patched calls over radio airwaves, from connecting to its network.  After AT&T was broken up into separate local and long-distance companies in 1982, telecommunication innovation blossomed, spreading to digital switching, fiber optics, cellphones\u2014and the internet.  Just as AT&T decided what equipment could be used on the nation\u2019s telephone systems, Google\u2019s search algorithms determine who can be found on the internet. If you searched for a toaster online in the mid 2000s, Google would probably have taken you to comparison shopping sites such as Nextag. They pioneered features such as showing consumer ratings in search results, how popular a product was and how prices had changed over time, recalls Gary Reback, an antitrust lawyer who represented several competitors against Google.  Google\u2019s Eric Schmidt testifying at a Senate Judiciary Committee antitrust hearing in September 2011. Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images  But when Google launched its own comparison business, Google Shopping, those sites found themselves dropping deeper into Google\u2019s search results. They accused Google of changing its algorithm to favor its own results. The company responded that its algorithm was designed to give customers the results they want. \u201cIf consumers don\u2019t like the answer that Google Search provides, they can switch to another search engine with just one click,\u201d Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt told Congress in 2011.  At that same hearing Jeffrey Katz, then the chief executive of Nextag, responded, \u201cThat is like saying move to Panama if you don\u2019t like the tax rate in America. It\u2019s a fake choice because no one has Google\u2019s scope or capabilities and consumers won\u2019t, don\u2019t, and in fact can\u2019t jump.\u201d  In 2013 the U.S. Federal Trade Commission concluded that even if Google had hurt competitors, it was to serve consumers better, and declined to bring a case. Since then, comparison sites such as Nextag have largely faded.  Last year the European Commission went in the other direction and fined the company $2.9 billion and ordered it to change its search results.  The different outcomes hinge in part on different approaches. European regulators are more likely to see a shrinking pool of competitors as inherently bad for both competition and consumers. American regulators are more open to the possibility that it could be natural and benign.  In new industries, smaller players are frequently bought up or vanquished by deeper-pocketed, more-innovative rivals. Google\u2019s general counsel, Kent Walker, wrote in response to the European Commission decision that even as smaller sites have retreated, Amazon has grown to become a huge player in comparison shopping.  Internet platforms have high fixed and minimal operating costs, which favors consolidation into a few deep-pocketed competitors. And the more customers a platform has, the more useful it is to each individual customer\u2014the \u201cnetwork effect.\u201d  But a platform that confers monopoly in one market can be leveraged to dominate another. Facebook\u2019s existing user base enabled it to become the world\u2019s largest photo-sharing site through its purchase of Instagram in 2012 and the largest instant-messaging provider through its purchase of WhatsApp in 2014. It is also muscling into virtual reality through its acquisition of Oculus VR in 2014 and anonymous polling with its purchase of TBH last year.  Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg speaks at a developers conference last year in San Jose, Calif. Photo: Stephen Lam/REUTERS  What Facebook doesn\u2019t acquire, it copies. Snap Inc.\u2019s Snapchat, a fast-disappearing photo and video sharing app hugely popular with teenagers, was widely seen as a challenger to Facebook. But in 2016, Facebook introduced its own Snapchat-like feature, Stories, on Instagram, which now has more users and advertisers than Snapchat. That has undercut Snap\u2019s growth and profits by reducing the number of new users \u201cinterested in trying Snap for the first time,\u201d says Peter Stabler, an analyst at Wells Fargo.  There\u2019s nothing wrong with copying, especially if the copy is better than the original. Snapchat\u2019s app was originally difficult to use, says Mr. Stabler, and \u201cyou can\u2019t discount [Facebook\u2019s] quality of execution.\u201d Moreover, even as Facebook copies its competitors, it continues to expand and enhance its own services such as Pages, which 70 million businesses world-wide have used to design their own webpages on Facebook.  Snap\u2019s shares have sunk below the price at which the company went public last March as losses have mounted, which won\u2019t encourage new entrants. Once a company like Google or Facebook has critical mass, \u201cthe venture capital looks elsewhere,\u201d says Roger McNamee of Elevation Partners, a technology-focused private-equity firm. \u201cThere\u2019s no point taking on someone with a three or four years head start.\u201d  Amazon hasn\u2019t yet reached the same market share as Google or Facebook but its position is arguably even more impregnable because it enjoys both physical and technological barriers to entry. Its roughly 75 fulfillment centers and state-of-the art logistics (including robots) put it closer, in time and space, to customers than any other online retailer.  The company says size makes it possible to deliver millions of items free of shipping charges to isolated communities with little retail presence. Amazon makes that network available to third-party merchants who pay a 15% commission and, typically, a $3 pick-pack-and ship-fee, says Greg Mercer, founder of Jungle Scout Inc. which advises third-party merchants how to sell on Amazon. \u201cWe have tons of examples of small entrepreneurial-type people who are really good at creating new inventions but have no idea how to distribute to the masses,\u201d he says. \u201cThey create products and Amazon can take care of the rest.\u201d  An Amazon warehouse in Britain. Photo: Jane Barlow/PA Images/Getty Images  As the dominant platform for third-party online sales, Amazon also has access to data it can use to decide what products to sell itself. In 2016 Capitol Forum, a news service that investigates anticompetitive behavior, reported that when a shopper views an Amazon private-label clothing brand, the accompanying list of items labeled \u201cCustomers Who Bought This Item Also Bought,\u201d is also dominated by Amazon\u2019s private-label brands. This, it says, restricts competing sellers\u2019 access to a prime marketing space  Mr. Mercer says he doesn\u2019t see Amazon favoring its own products, and indeed his own firm helps merchants target profitable niches on Amazon. Nonetheless, he says many would prefer to sell through their own sites, but with so many shoppers searching first on Amazon, they feel they have little choice.  In the face of such accusations, the probability of regulatory action\u2014for now\u2014looks low, largely because U.S. regulators have a relatively high bar to clear: Do consumers suffer?  \u201cWe think consumer welfare is the right standard,\u201d Bruce Hoffman, the FTC\u2019s acting director of the bureau of competition, recently told a panel on antitrust law and innovation. \u201cWe have tried other standards. They were dismal failures.\u201d  Still, Ms. Scott Morton notes, \u201cthe consumer welfare standard covers today and tomorrow,\u201d and the potential loss of innovation is something both the law and the courts can and have weighed in an antitrust case. The Justice Department sued Microsoft to ensure that an innovation, the internet browser, remained a potential competitor to Microsoft\u2019s monopoly over the user\u2019s interface with the personal computer.  Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates appeared at an antitrust hearing in Washington federal court in 2002. Photo: STEPHEN JAFFE/AFP/Getty Images  What would remedies look like? Since Big Tech owes its network effects to data, one often-proposed fix is to give users ownership of their own data: the \u201csocial graph\u201d of connections on Facebook, or their search history on Google and Amazon. They could then take it to a competitor.  A more drastic remedy would be to block acquisitions of companies that might one day be a competing platform. British regulators let Facebook buy Instagram in part because Instagram didn\u2019t sell ads, which they argued made them different businesses. In fact, Facebook used Instagram to engage users longer and thus sell more ads, Ben Thompson, wrote in his technology newsletter Stratechery. Building a network is \u201cextremely difficult, but, once built, nearly impregnable. The only possible antidote is another network that draws away the one scarce resource: attention.\u201d Thus, maintaining competition on the internet requires keeping \u201csocial networks in separate competitive companies.\u201d  How sound are these premises? Google\u2019s and Facebook\u2019s access to that data and network effects might seem like an impregnable barrier, but the same appeared to be true of America Online\u2019s membership, Yahoo \u2019s search engine and Apple\u2019s iTunes store, note two economists, David Evans and Richard Schmalensee, in a recent paper. All saw their dominance recede in the face of disruptive competition. If someone launched a clearly superior search engine, social network or online store, consumers could switch more easily than they could telephone or oil companies a century ago. Microsoft has long dominated desktop operating systems but has failed to extend that dominance to internet search or to mobile operating systems.  It\u2019s possible Microsoft might have become the dominant company in search and mobile without the scrutiny the federal antitrust case brought. Throughout history, entrepreneurs have often needed the government\u2019s help to dislodge a monopolist\u2014and may one day need it again.

TCEHY -3.15% will license each other\u2019s technology patents, a deal that could help the former broaden its toehold in the Chinese market and accelerate the global expansion of the latter.  They entered a long-term patent cross-licensing agreement for a broad range of products and technologies, the two companies said Friday, adding they were open to more cooperation in the future.  \u201cBy working together on agreements such as this, tech companies can focus on building better products and services for their users,\u201d Mike Lee, Google\u2019s head of patents, said in a statement.  Financial terms weren\u2019t disclosed, and neither company commented beyond their statements.  Cross-licensing deals allow companies to license each other\u2019s technology for use in different markets, said Lester Ross, an attorney at WilmerHale in Beijing. Mr. Ross said that cross-licensing deals can restrain competition, but that they also create market efficiencies\u2014for example, reducing the cost of having to file for patents in multiple countries.  Companies such as Samsung Electronics Co. and Apple Inc. have signed such agreements in the past to prevent infringing each other\u2019s technology and regional patents and therefore avoiding expensive lawsuits.  The arrangement is the latest in a string of moves by Google to expand its reach into mainland China, after it pulled out its main search business in 2010 due to concerns about hacking and censorship. Several weeks ago, the Mountain View, Calif.-based company opened an artificial-intelligence lab in Beijing, and this week said it is opening a new Chinese office\u2014in Shenzhen, the city near Hong Kong, where Tencent is based.  Google already operates offices in Beijing and Shanghai, employing about 600 staff. Although Google\u2019s search engine is blocked in China, the offices are used mostly for its ad sales staff and engineers working on its global products. Google will use the new base in Shenzhen in part to tap into the region\u2019s electronics hardware supply chain, according to an email sent to its Chinese employees.  Tencent is China\u2019s largest tech company by market capitalization, and it makes most of its money from videogames. Its WeChat social network app is dominant in China, but has scant reach beyond.  Chris DeAngelis, China general manager for technology consultancy Alliance Development Group, sees the tie-up with Google as a sign of Tencent\u2019s global ambitions.  \u201cIt represents that China\u2019s technology giants have grown up,\u201d Mr. DeAngelis said. \u201cTencent is now a global player.\u201d  Write to Liza Lin at liza.lin@wsj.com and Alyssa Abkowitz at alyssa.abkowitz@wsj.com", "stock": "GOOGL", "label": 1, "date": "2018-01-19", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-and-chinas-tencent-find-being-friends-has-benefits-1516353949"}, {"article": "French President Emmanuel Macron attends a hearing to mark the beginning of the year in Paris on Monday.  French President Emmanuel Macron attends a hearing to mark the beginning of the year in Paris on Monday. Photo: LUDOVIC MARIN, PRESS POOL  VERSAILLES, France\u2014French president Emmanuel Macron wined and dined Davos-bound business leaders inside the Palace of Versailles on Monday in an effort to shake off the country\u2019s image as a guillotine for foreign investment.  Some 140 executives, including Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai, met with Mr. Macron at the sprawling palace just outside Paris before traveling on to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.  The event, dubbed \u201cChoose France\u201d by Mr. Macron, is an attempt to persuade business leaders that France has finally changed its ways. Long criticized as a land of excessive red-tape and government meddling in the private sector, France is striking a different pose under Mr. Macron.  The investment banker-turned-president has adopted myriad pro-business measures during his first eight months in office, from looser labor laws to tax cuts. Now he is under pressure to show these changes can spur investment.  So far the results are mixed. While the French economy is growing again and economists expect unemployment to fall in the coming months, the latest figures showed the jobless rate rose to 9.7% at the end of the third quarter of 2017 from 9.5% in the second.  Mr. Macron used the Versailles meeting to announce a handful of investment projects officials said are \u201csignificant or emblematic\u201d for France\u2019s economic future, in areas from auto manufacturing to technology.  Facebook pledged Monday to double the size of its artificial intelligence lab in France to 60 researchers. Google said it would open an artificial intelligence research center in France and confirmed plans to increase staff at its Paris office to just over 1,000 from 700. Toyota said it would invest \u20ac300 million (about $367.3 million) at a site in the north of France, creating 700 permanent jobs.  Prior to the summit, Mr. Macron told businesses leaders they would only be invited to Versailles if they came promising a new investment project.  \u201cIt\u2019s not about asking for advice on such and such measure. We\u2019re saying: come and invest in France and create jobs,\u201d a French official said ahead of the visit.  Surveys show Mr. Macron has reasons to be optimistic. An annual poll by Ipsos of 200 France-based executives at international firms showed in November that 60% consider the country an attractive place to do business compared to 36% a year earlier. According to the same poll, 62% say the government is overhauling the economy at the right pace compared to 2% in the fall of 2016.  \u201cThe proof is here that France has once again become attractive for the biggest foreign investors,\u201d said Economy and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire.  France\u2019s changing image, however, will take time to show in quantitative measures of investment and hiring as companies need to adjust to new labor laws and changes to tax, business leaders say. The French government is also worried the U.S. tax overhaul could make it less attractive for U.S. firms to invest in Europe.  Business leaders held short meetings with Mr. Macron\u2019s cabinet in the afternoon in a format officials describe as \u201cspeed dating.\u201d Before hosting a dinner with all the delegates, Mr. Macron had 20-minute one-on-one meetings with Ms. Sandberg, Mr. Pichai, Novartis Chief Executive Vasant Narisimhan and SAP SE Chief Executive Bill McDermott.

Under the deal, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL -0.12% entered a contract to buy the Chelsea Market building at 75 Ninth Ave. from Jamestown LP, according to a person familiar with the transaction.  The potential acquisition comes as Amazon.com Inc., narrows its search for a second headquarters, and underscores the large impact the two companies can have on cities, raising real-estate values and adding high-paying jobs. The Alphabet deal also highlights New York City\u2019s ascendance in the past decade as one of the country\u2019s leading technology hubs.  Amazon has named New York City among the 20 finalists to host a second headquarters.  Technology companies have been increasing their share of office space in the Manhattan market over the past several years, with household names such as Amazon, Facebook Inc., Spotify USA and others signing large lease deals.  In the San Francisco Bay Area, tech companies have been gobbling up more space than they need in the short term to ensure they have enough capacity for workers and equipment down the line.  That might be playing out in New York too. The Chelsea Market deal \u201cis a potential land grab, where these firms are competing against one another, and you might see these firms take space defensively to ensure that they will have the space even though they don\u2019t need it now,\u201d said Sacha Zarba, vice chairman of real-estate-services firm CBRE Inc.  Google already has offices in the 1.2 million-square-foot building, which houses offices on the upper floors and shops and restaurants on the ground and lower-level floors. The building is home to other companies, including Major League Baseball Advanced Media and the Food Network.  The web-search giant also owns the 2.9 million-square-foot building at 111 Eighth Ave., which it bought in 2010. In addition, it has leased more than 200,000 square feet at Pier 57, a former freight terminal. The Chelsea neighborhood and Meatpacking District are part of the Midtown South office submarket, which is a favorite of the technology sector and has had vacancy rates that are among the lowest in the U.S.  New York City\u2019s technology landscape has changed dramatically over the last decade, when skeptics doubted whether its labor force could support a large technology hub.  \u201cAny further long-term real-estate commitments by Google are proof positive that New York is the present and future home for technology innovation and the most fertile ground for talent retention,\u201d said Doug Harmon, of Cushman & Wakefield, a longtime adviser to Jamestown and the broker who worked on this transaction and the sale of 111 Eighth Ave. to Alphabet.  \ufeff GOOGL -0.12% The Chelsea Market deal was reported earlier by the Real Deal.  The potential acquisition of the Chelsea Market building also highlights some of the options that global companies, especially tech companies, are now considering as the new tax law takes effect.

Since its founding in 2013, CoreOS raised $48 million in venture capital \u2014 likely making this a solid exit for its high-profile bunch of Silicon Valley investors, including Kleiner Perkins, Intel Capital, Y Combinator, and GV (formerly Google Ventures).  Indeed, CoreOS has a history with Google: In 2015, at the same time as it announced the investment from GV, CoreOS made a big bet on supporting Kubernetes, a Google-created developer technology. Since then, Kubernetes has become a predominant standard in the market for software containers, raising the profile of CoreOS.  \"We made the right bets along the way,\" CoreOS CEO Alex Polvi told Business Insider on Tuesday.  Polvi points out that CoreOS and Red Hat have long had a business relationship, and says the acquisition will let them keep doing what they've been doing \"in a bigger and better way.\"  This is actually the second time Polvi has led a company to an acquisition. In 2010, he sold his company Cloudkick to Rackspace for a reported $30 million, after raising a relatively modest $2.75 million.  CoreOS was one of the first and most visible companies in the container space, seen for a long time as the chief rival to $1.3 billion startup Docker, which basically invented the market. Indeed, in 2014, the two of them had a public falling out over the future of containers.  Think of these \"containers\" as a metaphor. Shipping yards put goods into a bunch of shipping containers all the same shape and size because it makes them easy to stack onto boats. Software containers are a standard way to package up software, so it all runs the same way whether it's running on your laptop, a corporate server, or in a massive cloud like Amazon Web Services.  Red Hat president Jim Whitehurst Red Hat  In this metaphor, Kubernetes is the gantry crane that lifts and loads these containers: It helps IT departments and developer teams keep all their containers moving smoothly across their infrastructure. As containers grow in popularity, so too has Kubernetes as a way to manage them.  This is the root of Red Hat's interest in CoreOS. CoreOS originally rose to prominence as the developers of a custom, lightweight version of the Linux operating system designed for smart gadgetry like DVD players.  However, it turned out that the CoreOS software was ideal for lightweight software containers, too, ultimately leading it towards Kubernetes. Now, in addition to the CoreOS software, Red Hat offers Tectonic, a Kubernetes-based container management system of its own.  Red Hat supports Kubernetes in its own server-side software products, and offers its own Kubernetes-based container management tools. It turns out that CoreOS, in developing its own container offerings, made it super-easy to keep a Kubernetes system up to date with the latest security patches and other updates \u2014 bolstering Red Hat's play.  \"A lot of their operations have been around making things easier,\" Matt Hicks, a senior VP of engineering at Red Hat, told Business Insider on Tuesday. He says CoreOS technology is \"kind of complementary in terms of how we work together.\"  In particular, Red Hat is excited about how CoreOS and its Linux distribution make it easier to keep a bunch of Kubernetes-managed containers up-to-date in terms of security patches and new feature updates.  \"We think our largest customers will benefit from this,\" Red Hat VP and general manager Ashesh Badani told Business Insider.  According to Polvi, there's not going to be much change in the game-plan in the short-term. But in the long-term, expect to see deeper integrations between Red Hat's whole product suite and the CoreOS offering.  \"Over the coming months, we'll set the longer-term roadmap and figure it out,\" Polvi told us.", "stock": "GOOGL", "label": -1, "date": "2018-01-31", "source": "business-insider", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/red-hat-coreos-acquisition-explanation-2018-1"}, {"article": "Google cofounder Larry Page Getty  Google crossed a red line on Tuesday.  Actually, Google crossed the line sometime before Tuesday, but it was only with Gizmodo's report about Google's contract providing AI technology to the U.S. Department of Defense that the world learned about the situation.  For anyone who has followed Google for some time, the revelation of its contract with the Pentagon is stunning. That's because Google has long resisted playing any part in the military industrial complex.  It's not a policy that's explicitly written in any of Google's bylaws, but it's easy enough to recognize.  In the past 10 years of records available on USAspending.gov, there are roughly a dozen public contracts between Google and the Department of Defense.  These contracts are all inconsequential: $10,ooo for access to Google Earth here, or $6,000 for Google's search hardware there. It's less than pocket change for the deep-pocketed Google.  A company like Google would need to go out of its way to avoid working with the military  For a company at the leading edge of tech innovation, Google's lack of military contracts is pretty remarkable. Compare that to Microsoft, for instance, which has hundreds of contracts with the DoD during the past ten years, including a $78 million multi-year consulting deal with the Air Force.  A Boston Dynamics robot Boston Dynamics When Google acquired the robotics company Boston Dynamics in 2013, Google even went so far as to publicly say that, while it would honor any of Boston Dynamics' existing military contracts, Google would not pursue new work with the DoD and that it did not plan to become a military contractor.  Google has since sold Boston Dynamics, and Google is not building killer robots for the military. But the AI contract with the military is clearly a break from tradition \u2014 according to Gizmodo, the accidental revelation of the contract within Google set off a firestorm among some employees.  According to the report, the military is using Google's TensorFlow \u2014 open source technology that anyone can use to create applications that harness artificial intelligence \u2014 to help analyze video footage collected by drones.  The collaboration is part of a pilot project known as Project Maven, and most likely involves Google staffers helping the military figure out how to use TensorFlow and other AI technology. Google is not disclosing the financial terms of the contract.  This is not what most people think the words \"non-offensive\" means  Google is trying to downplay the revelation as business as usual. The company's official statement stresses that Google has always worked with \"government agencies,\" as if there were no difference between working with the Department of Education and the Department of Defense.  Google also insists that the contract is for \"non-offensive\" uses of its technology.  Still, it's not clear what exactly \"non-offensive\" really means. Sure, Google technology may not be part of a Skynet-like system that allows drones to automatically fire missiles when Google's AI detects an enemy target.  But Google is using a much narrower definition of \"non-offensive\" than what most people probably imagine.  Google's AI technology will allow drones to distinguish between a school with students carrying books and a bunker with gun-toting fighters. Yes, it will be up to military analysts to then decide whether or not to strike a target. But to describe Google's role in these scenarios as \"non-offensive\" stretches credulity.  Google is jeopardizing its biggest asset  This is a big reversal of what appears to have at the very least been an unofficial policy long espoused by the company that brought you Don't be Evil.  It's worth noting that former Google CEO and Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt was appointed to a Pentagon advisory board in March 2016 aimed at bringing Silicon Valley innovation to the military. In December 2017, Schmidt resigned his position as Executive Chairman of Alphabet (though he remains on the board and a technical advisor) so that he could \"dive into\" the latest science, technology and philanthropy.  Whatever the cause of the change, it's alarming because Google's biggest asset is consumer trust. Specifically, the trust that a company that has accumulated so much personal data about our lives (from our search history, to the places we go using Google Maps) and that has so much power, will remain loyal to the principles on which founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin built the company.  As Google, and its now-parent company Alphabet, expand into more areas of our lives (Waymo for cars, Verily for health), and as the company's founders get older, it's reasonable to wonder if it still represents the values it once did.  To be clear, there's nothing wrong with Google working with the military. Plenty of tech companies do it. It's every company's prerogative to make that decision. But Google made a choice many years ago to not dedicate its technology to warfare.  If it's going to change that, especially as Google becomes a major developer of sophisticated artificial technology, it owes the world and the employees working on that technology an honest explanation.", "stock": "GOOGL", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-06", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/google-working-with-united-states-department-of-defense-2018-3"}, {"article": "Over the years, regulators on both sides of the Atlantic have cracked down on Facebook and Google for privacy violations.

The two sides are expected to come to an agreement eventually, according to three people familiar with the negotiations who would speak only on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were private.  But the Justice Department\u2019s demands for more divestitures has added another layer of complexity to a deal that, from the moment it was announced, faced broad opposition from Democratic lawmakers and consumer groups. Opponents have argued that the deal would curtail the number of unique voices in media, reduce coverage of local news and decrease competition.  The F.C.C. is reviewing the merger separately from the Justice Department, focusing on whether the deal is in the public\u2019s interest. The agency is widely expected to approve the deal.  Last week, in an attempt to move closer to a resolution, Sinclair submitted a proposal to sell stations in big markets including New York and Chicago, as well as some smaller stations. The proposal would put many of the stations in trusts, an arrangement that has raised some concern from consumer groups that the company will try to operate them through partners down the road, because it runs some stations that way now.  Photo  The Tribune stations in New York and Chicago would not go into a trust, but Sinclair said it had reached agreements to sell those stations to third parties that it would partner with later. Selling them will help Sinclair get near an important threshold: owning stations that reach no more than than 39 percent of American households, the limit under F.C.C. rules.  The F.C.C. review could hit another roadblock. The agency\u2019s inspector general is looking into whether the F.C.C. chairman, Ajit Pai, improperly coordinated with Sinclair on regulatory decisions that enabled the merger. The inspector general\u2019s office says its policy is to not comment on the existence or the nonexistence of an investigation.

The government\u2019s demands are an unexpected setback for Sinclair, which predicted its proposal would be met by more sympathy from regulators in the Trump administration.  Sinclair\u2019s initial confidence was partly buoyed by a string of regulatory victories last year at the F.C.C., including the relaxation of a television ownership limit last April that enabled its $3.9 billion merger with Tribune.  Analysts had expected more corporate consolidation under President Trump, but the Justice Department\u2019s response to Sinclair\u2019s proposed deal for Tribune instead underscores a surprising skepticism toward big corporate mergers, particularly those involving the media industry. In November, the Justice Department sued to block AT&T\u2019s $85 billion bid for Time Warner because of concern that the union of telecom and media giants would have too much power over streaming video entertainment.  \u201cClearly, the D.O.J. has honed in on the dangers of concentrated transmission and concentrated media content markets that is harmful to competition and to consumers,\u201d said Gene Kimmelman, president of the public interest group Public Knowledge and a former senior antitrust official the Justice Department.  The biggest sticking point for Sinclair appears to be how many stations it would need to sell in order to get its deal approved.  In its new proposal, Sinclair asked that it be able to keep multiple stations in greater Greensboro, N.C., greater Harrisburg, Pa., and Indianapolis.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo  Lawyers for Sam Rainsy, who fled Cambodia in 2015 to escape a conviction for defamation he says was politically motivated, said he sought the information to help him in his own legal cases in Cambodia.  Supporters of Hun Sen have built a strong presence on Facebook.  Sam Rainsy wants information on allegations of \u201cfalse likes\u201d on Hun Sen\u2019s Facebook account, accusations that the platform had been used to make death threats and the use of state money for advertisements, his legal team said in a statement on Wednesday.  Government spokesman Phay Siphan said the lawsuit was \u201cnot useful\u201d.  The case highlights the growing global nature of the challenge to Facebook Inc over its role in political debate after accusations that social media was used for meddling in votes in Britain, the United States and elsewhere.  Facebook has become an ever more important platform for political news in Cambodia as some media outlets critical of Hun Sen have been forced to shut.  Hun Sen, 65, has been criticized by Western countries over a ban on the main opposition party and the arrest of its leader less than a year away from a general election on July 29.

Rogers, of rights group Global Diligence LLP.  Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the case, which Sam Rainsy\u2019s lawyers said had been brought in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.  Hun Sen\u2019s Facebook profile was private, the Cambodian government spokesman added.  \u201cThe Facebook profile of the Samdech Prime Minister is private, it\u2019s not a terrorist group to cause any insecurity with any country,\u201d said Phay Siphan, using the official title for Hun Sen, who has ruled Cambodia for more than 33 years.  Facebook, which has more than 2 billion users globally, tells advertisers they have the potential to reach 6.6 million people in Cambodia, from a population of nearly 16 million.  It says more than 5.5 million people have expressed an interest in, or liked, pages related to Hun Sen, of whom 1.8 million are in Cambodia.

Facebook said earlier this month it would change its centerpiece News Feed to prioritize what friends and family share, while reducing the amount of non-advertising content from publishers and brands.  Those changes contributed to a fall in quarterly time spent that added up to about 5 percent on Facebook and 4 percent on its platforms including Instagram.  \u201cWe continue to believe that any slowdown in time spent will be compensated for by higher-quality time spent, and that any trimming of ad load will be compensated for by higher ad pricing,\u201d Graham said.  While the number of daily users in the United States and Canada fell for the first time in Facebook\u2019s history, the average price per ad increased 43 percent in quarter.  One reason for the ad dollars to continue to grow strongly through these changes was that Facebook\u2019s ad targeting tools and offerings deliver return-on-investment for advertisers, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak said.

REUTERS/Toby Melville  The verdict, from a Berlin regional court, comes as Big Tech faces increasing scrutiny in Germany over its handling of sensitive personal data that enables it to micro-target online advertising.  The Federation of German Consumer Organisations (vzvb) said that Facebook\u2019s default settings and some of its terms of service were in breach of consumer law, and that the court had found parts of the consent to data usage to be invalid.  \u201cFacebook hides default settings that are not privacy-friendly in its privacy center and does not provide sufficient information about it when users register,\u201d said Heiko Duenkel, litigation policy officer at the vzvb.  \u201cThis does not meet the requirement for informed consent.\u201d The vzvb posted a copy of the ruling on its website.

In a statement, it said it had already made significant changes to its terms of service and data protection guidelines since the case was first brought in 2015.  \u201cWe are working hard to ensure that our guidelines are clear and easy to understand, and that the services offered by Facebook are in full accordance with the law,\u201d Facebook said.

The Federal Cartel Office, in an interim update on an investigation into Facebook, said in December that it objected to the way the company gains access to third-party data when an account is opened.  This includes tapping information from its own WhatsApp and Instagram products - as well as how it tracks which sites its users access.  One concern highlighted by the consumer rights group was that, in Facebook\u2019s app for smartphones, a service was pre-activated that revealed the user\u2019s location to the person they were chatting to.  Also, in the privacy settings, ticks were already placed in boxes that allowed search engines to link to the user\u2019s timeline, meaning that anyone would be able quickly and easily to find a user\u2019s profile.  \u201cThe judges ruled that all five of the default settings on Facebook that vzvb complained about are invalid,\u201d the group said in a statement, adding that several other of Facebook\u2019s terms of use were found to be illegal.", "stock": "FB", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-12", "source": "reuters", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-facebook/german-court-rules-facebook-use-of-personal-data-illegal-idUSKBN1FW1FI"}, {"article": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York state\u2019s highest court ruled on Tuesday that Facebook users may be required to turn over photos and other information that are relevant to litigation, even if they are shielded by \u201cprivacy\u201d settings.

Kelly Forman said she became a recluse after suffering a spinal injury and brain damage, making it hard to read and write, in a June 2011 fall caused by Mark Henkin\u2019s negligence in fitting her horse with a defective stirrup that broke.  To defend himself against Forman\u2019s damages claims, Henkin sought access to her entire \u201cprivate\u201d Facebook account.  In February 2014, a trial judge ordered Forman to give Henkin pre-accident photos she intended to use at trial, post-accident photos not depicting nudity or romantic encounters, and access to post-accident records of her messages.  But in December 2015, a state appeals court limited the disclosure to photos intended for trial, saying Henkin could not go on a \u201cfishing expedition\u201d for evidence.  DiFiore, however, reinstated the trial judge\u2019s ruling, saying the appeals court erred in employing a \u201cheightened threshold\u201d for disclosing social media records that depended on what users chose to share publicly.  \u201cSome materials on a Facebook account may fairly be characterized as private,\u201d DiFiore wrote, \u201cbut even private materials may be subject to discovery if they are relevant.\u201d  Henkin\u2019s photo request \u201cwas reasonably calculated to yield evidence relevant to plaintiff\u2019s assertion that she could no longer engage in the activities she enjoyed before the accident and that she had become reclusive,\u201d she added.

It amounts to a small fraction of Facebook\u2019s current market value of roughly $537 billion as of Monday\u2019s market close.  Shareholders led by the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System and Fresno County Employees\u2019 Retirement Association in California accused Facebook of concealing internal concerns about how growth in mobile devices might reduce revenue, even as it quietly warned its banks to cut their forecasts.

The settlement resolves claims against Facebook, officials including Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and director Peter Thiel, and bank underwriters covering a five-day period surrounding the $16 billion IPO, from May 17 to May 21, 2012.

An internal Facebook white paper, published days after the election, shows the company\u2019s data scientists agree.  \u201cBoth campaigns spent heavily on Facebook between June and November of 2016,\u201d the author of the internal paper writes, citing revenue of $44 million for Trump and $28 million for Clinton in that period. \u201cBut Trump\u2019s FB campaigns were more complex than Clinton\u2019s and better leveraged Facebook\u2019s ability to optimize for outcomes.\u201d  The paper, obtained by Bloomberg and discussed here for the first time, describes in granular detail the difference between Trump\u2019s campaign, which was focused on finding new donors, and Clinton\u2019s campaign, which concentrated on ensuring Clinton had broad appeal. The data scientist says 84 percent of Trump\u2019s budget asked people on Facebook to take an action, like donating, compared with 56 percent of Clinton\u2019s.  Facebook didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.  Trump ran 5.9 million different versions of ads during the presidential campaign and rapidly tested them to spread those that generated the most Facebook engagement, according to the paper. Clinton ran 66,000 different kinds of ads in the same period.  As is typical at Facebook, employees had access to the white paper, according to a person familiar with the matter. Employees routinely publish papers so colleagues can dig into issues facing the company and learn how certain products work.  A former Facebook employee cited the information from the white paper in a memo to Representative Adam Schiff\u2019s office in early March, saying it could help Congress ask the right questions about whether the campaign coordinated with Russia. For example, according to the paper, more than a quarter of Trump\u2019s ad spending was tied to third-party data files on voters, and leveraged a Facebook tool that helped the campaign show ads to people who looked similar to the names on file. Clinton\u2019s ads aimed for broader audiences, with only 4 percent of her Facebook spend on the lookalike tool.  \u201cDid Russian operatives give the Trump campaign a list of names to include or exclude from advertising that was running on Facebook?\u201d the former employee asked in the memo.  Republicans shut down the House of Representatives\u2019 investigation into Russia and Trump days later, \u201cleaving questions unanswered, leads unexplored, countless witnesses uncalled, subpoenas unissued,\u201d Schiff, a California Democrat, wrote on Twitter. A Schiff spokesman declined to comment for this story.  But Congress is still focusing on the use of third-party information on Facebook for another reason: the company\u2019s ensuing crisis over data on 50 million users obtained by Cambridge Analytica, a political advertising firm that helped Trump\u2019s campaign. Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg is set to make his first congressional testimony on the issue in a matter of days.  One key question Zuckerberg is likely to face, raised in the former employee\u2019s memo to Schiff: What lists of Facebook users did Trump\u2019s campaign upload for advertising purposes?  Facebook is still working to unearth other information that congressional investigators have requested. The company is continuing to comb through its site to identify content posted by the Internet Research Agency, a Russian organization that used Facebook to manipulate public discourse in America ahead of the election. On Tuesday, the company took down more than 270 accounts and pages operated by the IRA that were used to spread messages to people in Russia and neighboring countries.  \u201cThis is the next step towards removing them from Facebook entirely,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote Tuesday on his Facebook page. \u201cOrganizations like the IRA are sophisticated adversaries who are constantly evolving, but we\u2019ll keep improving our techniques to stay ahead -- especially when it comes to protecting the integrity of elections.\u201d", "stock": "FB", "label": 1, "date": "2018-04-03", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-03/trump-s-campaign-said-it-was-better-at-facebook-facebook-agrees"}, {"article": "Facebook, can we talk about your spending?  The company is going on a spree. Facebook has said its costs for web video programs, people to patrol the social network for abusive posts, its virtual reality project and other investments will swell by 45 percent to 60 percent this year. Investors are mostly fine with this. The company has justified the spending on its top priorities, including guarding against Russia-backed misinformation campaigns or other abuses.  But there is another category of costs that is likely to increase at a much faster clip, and Facebook hasn't detailed why. The company last week repeated a forecast that its capital costs -- spending on fleets of computer equipment, new corporate buildings and other physical assets -- will more than double, from $6.7 billion in 2017 to an estimated $14 billion to $15 billion in 2018.  Hey, Big Spender Facebook expects its capital expenses will more than double in 2018 Data: Bloomberg and Facebook's 2018 forecast; graphic by Bloomberg Gadfly  Even when Facebook was growing quickly into a titan, its capital costs never doubled from one year to the next. Facebook executives have said the significantly higher capital spending in 2018 will be for computing networks and other investments to \"support growth and improve our products,\" as the company's top finance executive said in November.  That's not much of an explanation for what is both an astounding jump in capital spending and a stunning overall sum. Companies with $14 billion or more in yearly capital expenditures tend to be those that make complex physical products such as computer chips or cars.  Facebook rearranges pixels; it doesn't drill for oil and gas as Exxon Mobil does. And yet Exxon's capital spending is on par with Facebook's 2018 forecast, at about $14.8 billion in the 12 months ended Sept. 30, according to Bloomberg data. Insert the cliche about how \"data is the new oil.\"  Investors have not publicly pressed Facebook to explain how it will spend its 2018 capital budget. They are fixated on far more pressing issues, including the company's effort to weed out harmful behavior on the social network, ward off potential regulatory crackdowns and expand important businesses including internet video and Instagram, the Facebook-owned app. As long as Facebook's financials continue to be healthy, stockholders are likely to remain unconcerned about a big step up in capital costs.  But there is a precedent that should worry Facebook a little. A few years ago, Google's capital spending was growing significantly. It more than doubled in 2013 and surged 49 percent in 2014. To investors, the capital spending increases were among the evidence that Google had become financially undisciplined. The company's stock price declined 5 percent for the year.  Then Google hired a new chief financial officer and imposed a stricter watch on its wallet. Capex declined in 2015 and has increased more slowly ever since. Google's commitment to spending discipline was among the reasons investors regained confidence in it.  Catching Up Facebook may have a bigger tab of capital spending this year than Google's parent company, whose revenue is twice as large Data: Bloomberg and Facebook forecasts; graphic by Bloomberg Gadfly  If Facebook's 2018 capital costs match the company's forecast, it may pass Google parent company Alphabet in capital spending, even though the web search giant's revenue is twice as large. Facebook may also join the ranks of Google, Intel and Apple of the U.S. technology industry's biggest capex spenders. (South Korea's sprawling electronics giant Samsung has by far the largest capex spending of global tech companies.)  Big Leagues Facebook's expected 2018 capital costs would put it among the world's top spending tech companies Data: Bloomberg and Facebook's 2018 forecast; graphic by Bloomberg Gadfly  The rising capex tab for Facebook is another reminder that the world's web habits require costly and complex underlying infrastructure of internet pipes, computers, electricity and people to keep it all humming.  It's also possible Facebook has some secrets up its sleeve that will require a big step up in capital costs. Bloomberg News has reported that Facebook is working on more consumer hardware, including a home videoconferencing device, and those ambitions require new kinds of spending.  Facebook's capital binge hasn't attracted much attention from investors. But if the company's revenue grows more slowly than investors expect, those costs may suddenly look worrisome.

The company kept warning that its rate of revenue growth would slow and that its plans to spend more money and remodel Facebook into less of a cesspool would drag down profit margins and perhaps result in people using Facebook less.  Investors learned not to be so concerned about Facebook's predictions of impending doom, although now it looks as if some of those cautions are coming true and outsiders weren't sufficiently braced for it.  Facebook said on Wednesday that its revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 rose 47 percent from a year earlier. Yes, that was (barely) the sixth consecutive quarter of slowing growth for Facebook; but come on, it's impressive for a company of Facebook's size to regularly boost sales at this pace. Out of 300 global companies of Facebook's size, only a few are growing more quickly, Bloomberg data show.  What, Me Worry? Facebook has warned its revenue growth would start to slow by now. It's not much of a slowdown, though. Source: Bloomberg and Facebook  The fourth-quarter revenue performance came despite Facebook's repeated warnings that its advertising sales growth would slow noticeably at this point because of its decision to stop shoving more ads into the Facebook news feed. It's clear that Facebook more than made up the difference thanks to higher ad prices and new types of advertisements that appeal to companies eager to pitch to Facebook's giant audience.  Wall Street does expect Facebook's sales to slow meaningfully soon. Analysts think Facebook's revenue will increase about 33 percent in 2018, according to the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That's slow for Facebook but impressive in any rational world. It makes sense for any company to underpromise and over-deliver. But given how often Facebook has warned investors that its financials will start to look a little less handsome, they may not believe the company if the ugliness really comes this time.  That's more of a worry now because Facebook has started to fire up the alarms about other elements of its business, and those appear to be coming true. CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently said his decision to change the formula to prioritize \"meaningful social interaction\" on Facebook might cause people to spend less time hanging out on the social network.  The company disclosed on Wednesday the slowest rate of growth in its history in the number of daily users. The number of users in North America fell for the first time in the fourth quarter. And Facebook said that the changes it made to play down viral videos and other less-than-optimal programming reduced the time spent on Facebook by roughly 50 million hours each day. That works out to roughly 2 minutes for each of Facebook's 1.4 billion daily users.  Uh Oh In the fourth quarter, Facebook posted its slowest-ever growth rate in daily users Source: Bloomberg and Facebook  In principle, though, even a small reduction isn't good for Facebook's future advertising revenue because the more time people spend on Facebook, the more chances Facebook has to sell paid commercials. Facebook shares dipped about 4 percent in trading after the regular market close before rebounding.  The worry, of course, is that Facebook's second quarter of relatively meek daily user growth may be the result of people's dislike of hanging out on Facebook. And that's an existential threat to Facebook's popularity and its business. That's worthy of five ringing alarms of caution. The changes Facebook made to its news feed were announced after the end of 2017. It seems likely, then, that slowing daily user growth in the fourth quarter wasn't caused by the news feed changes, and that more declines in time spent may be coming.  Other fears have yet to come to pass. Facebook has also said it will spend much more this year on people and technology to oversee posts and advertising, to avoid a repeat of the 2016 Russian-backed misinformation campaigns that remain the subject of congressional inquiry. It also plans to spend more on video programming for its TV-like digital hangout and to build up relatively young businesses including virtual reality and artificial intelligence.  Facebook has warned that this increased spending will hurt its profit margins in 2018, but investors don't seem to believe it. Wall Street's expectations work out to an expected 2018 operating income margin of 43 percent, Bloomberg data show. Facebook ended 2017 by posting a record 57 percent quarterly operating margin. That gives the company room to spend more without dragging its margins to worrisome levels.  Profit Powerhouse Facebook has higher operating profit margins than all but a handful of 500 large U.S. companies Source: Bloomberg  Facebook has been tamping down expectations for so long, investors didn't take seriously enough the company's cries of distress. And as the stock reaction from Facebook's user growth and engagement numbers show, investors weren't prepared for Facebook's warnings to come to fruition.

Facebook has publicly credited Snapchat for creating the popular \"stories\" function that allows people to post disappearing videos about their days, which is now more popular on Facebook\u2019s properties than it is on Snapchat.  BlackBerry was an early pioneer in messaging. Its proprietary service BBM helped draw millions to its phones in the mid-2000s when the company was a smartphone leader. But the company waited years before opening BBM up to phones running Apple Inc. or Alphabet Inc. operating systems, and as those companies took over the smartphone market, BBM\u2019s popularity faded along with BlackBerry\u2019s devices.

Changes rolled out so far by Facebook Inc., Twitter Inc. and other technology companies wouldn\u2019t prevent the tactics revealed Friday by U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation of Russian operatives -- let alone any new hacks dreamed up by bad actors.  An indictment issued by Mueller said at least 13 Russians engaged in a sophisticated campaign to sway public opinion around the 2016 presidential election. They posed as U.S. citizens, using falsified paperwork and stolen bank numbers, to hide their real identities and opened PayPal Holdings Inc. accounts to buy ads on popular social media sites.  The narrative laid out by Mueller describes a more advanced Russian-backed misinformation effort than previously known. Until now, Facebook and Twitter had been criticized for missing Russian purchases of U.S. election ads through their systems. PayPal hadn\u2019t featured publicly in the investigations until Friday.  The identity theft detailed in the indictment is tougher than the problems these companies have so far tried to solve. Facebook is boosting its security-focused workforce and adding transparency for who purchases ads. Twitter is creating a \u201ctransparency center\u201d on political campaign ad spending, too. Alphabet Inc.\u2019s YouTube is hiring thousands of people to vet videos. None of these steps would prevent foreign agents from using stolen identities and bank accounts to buy divisive ads and create misleading posts.  PayPal is a pioneer in online identity and fraud detection. And yet, it\u2019s digital payments service was the funding vehicle for the Russian operatives\u2019 deceptive campaigns -- making their transactions appear in social media companies\u2019 systems like any other purchases in U.S. dollars.  The Russians\u2019 approach raises the question of whether other parties have bought -- or will buy -- ads using stolen identities. It also undermines the main value of social media business models: That people are who they say they are. Facebook and Twitter sell ads through automated systems where brands can opt to reach certain audiences, and later find out how many people they reached. Friday\u2019s indictment shows how this system can be easily gamed, and highlights the risk that even more accounts may not be fake, eroding trust in those metrics.  Meanwhile, as long as social media platforms work the way they do, by making it easy to pay to spread incendiary messages, it\u2019s hard to see this problem going away, said Zeynep Tufekci, an information sciences professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  \u201cThey used the platforms as they were designed,\u201d Tufekci wrote on Twitter from a verified account. \u201cAll the problems most everyone is worried about will be with us pretty much at the same scale in 2018 and 2020 even if not another ruble is spent on U.S. elections.\u201d  The indictment also described how the Russian operatives used online distribution and marketing tactics that were as advanced as any legitimate social media campaign -- making it difficult for companies to detect anomalies. The operatives worked in shifts to ensure they made posts in accordance with U.S. time zones and circulated lists of U.S. holidays so the accounts posing as citizens could post appropriate content, according to the indictment. They also regularly evaluated their content to make sure it appeared authentic, and received feedback on how much text, graphics or video to use to appear naturally American.  The indictment has already renewed calls to regulate social media. Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, said Mueller\u2019s investigation shows Russia was using online ads to wage an \u201cinformation war\u201d against the U.S. and Congress should pass new laws to police political advertising on social media immediately.  \u201cWe do not have time to wait. If Congress continues to refuse to act, we are aiding Russia\u2019s efforts to divide and influence our nation\u2014inaction is unacceptable,\u201d Klobuchar said in an emailed statement. She is a co-sponsor of the Honest Ads Act, which would regulate online election ads.  Next month, the Federal Election Commission will also consider a proposal to require online political ads to carry the same disclaimers from sponsors as do radio, television and print ads.  \u201cWe know we have more to do to prevent against future attacks,\" Joel Kaplan, Facebook\u2019s vice president of global policy, said in a statement on Friday.  Facebook is working closely with the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and other companies on better ways to protect the U.S. and the company\u2019s users, he added. The FBI has created task force on election interference, and Facebook is actively working with the agency, Kaplan also said.  Ahead of midterm elections in the U.S. later this year, Twitter said it\u2019s verifying major party candidates for all statewide and federal elective offices, and major national party accounts, as a \"hedge against impersonation.\" The company is also improving its anti-spam technology to track down networks of malicious bots targeting election-related matters, while monitoring trends and spikes in conversations about the 2018 elections to spot potential manipulation.  \"Tech companies cannot defeat this novel, shared threat alone,\" Twitter said in a statement. \"The best approach is to share information and ideas to increase our collective  knowledge, with the full weight of government and law enforcement leading the charge against threats to our democracy.\"", "stock": "FB", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-17", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-17/facebook-twitter-ill-equipped-to-stop-repeat-of-2016-meddling"}, {"article": "Russian operatives using social media to manipulate the U.S. election bought their Facebook ads in a sophisticated manner: stealing the identities of Americans and opening accounts at PayPal Holdings Inc.  \u201cDefendants and their co-conspirators also obtained, and attempted to obtain, false identification documents to use as proof of identity in connection with maintaining accounts and purchasing advertisements on social media sites,\u201d according to an indictment issued Friday by U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller. The indictment described a multiyear effort by Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency and others to shape American opinions, including by impersonating Americans on Facebook, Instagram, Google\u2019s YouTube and Twitter Inc.  Mueller described a sophistication beyond what Congress had understood about the Russian meddling in the election. At hearings three months ago, Facebook Inc. was criticized for not quickly becoming suspicious of U.S. election ads purchased in Russian rubles. But with stolen American identities and PayPal accounts, the ads would be unlikely to trigger any alarm, and the extent of the campaign may still not be fully known.  PayPal said it is \u201cintensely focused on combating and preventing the illicit use of our services.\u201d  \u201cWe work closely with law enforcement, and did so in this matter, to identify, investigate and stop improper or potentially illegal activity,\u201d the San Jose, California-based company said in a statement.  The indictment alleges the Russian-backed IRA opened U.S. bank accounts with Social Security numbers and identities they\u2019d stolen from Americans. They bought stolen bank account numbers online as well, using them to bypass PayPal\u2019s security system and open accounts, with which they bought Facebook ads.  PayPal accounts were used for general expenses, the purchase of advertisements and to buy buttons, flags and banners for the political rallies organized through the social media scheme, according to the indictment.  The ads purchased by Russian actors on Facebook went through an automated buying system, where they are only flagged if they break rules on the social network related to its community standards. The company has since bolstered the team that reviews ads and is planning to add tools to let users know who is behind them. Still, that is unlikely to solve a problem of stolen identity behind a purchase.  The revelation ratchets up the pressure on Facebook and Twitter to bolster their defenses, or risk government regulation.

He said the notion was supported by both intelligence at the time and the indictment unsealed Friday by Special Counsel Robert Mueller against 13 Russian nationals and three Russian entities.  Rob Goldman, Facebook\u2019s vice president of ad sales, tweeted Friday that \u201cswaying the election was *NOT* the main goal\u201d -- prompting President Donald Trump to retweet the message the next day to back his claim that Russian meddling didn\u2019t affect the results of the election. The Russians\u2019 aim was to help Trump and hurt his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, as well as to sow discord, according to the indictment.  \u201cNever before have we seen an effort like this mounted by the Russians,\u201d said Clapper, who described an \u201cambient level\u201d of attempts at interference by Russia and the Soviet Union going back to the 1960s and more activity in 2015 and 2016. \u201cThe multidimensional nature of it and its aggressiveness and directness: This was unprecedented,\u201d he said.  Evidence Cited  Among the evidence Goldman pointed to in a series of posts was that 56 percent of the Facebook ads bought by the indicted Russians were displayed after the Nov. 8 election. The company verified his posts as authentic.  In a follow-up tweet, Goldman attempted to soften his earlier comments by saying that \u201cthe Russian campaign was certainly in favor of Trump.

Then blockchain came along.  After stumbling onto a new corner of the internet based on the digital-ledger technology, Kadavy said he gets paid to post his blog and podcast on Steemit, a website whose text are saved on a blockchain. The site has its own digital currencies, the best-known of which is called Steem, and pays people such as Kadavy who post and comment on the site. Kadavy, a 38-year-old American writer living in Colombia, said he made about $2,000 in January.  \u201cI feel like I\u2019m in the Stone Age when I\u2019m on Facebook or Twitter,\u201d Kadavy said. \u201cThey have no value without what you\u2019re contributing to them. If Facebook doesn\u2019t respond to this, things can change very quickly. They should be very concerned.\u201d  The so-called financial internet stands the Facebook business model on its head. With Facebook, users post content on the site and the company collects the money -- last year, $41 billion in revenue. On Steemit, the money goes in the other direction. Facebook, with 2.1 billion monthly users, may not even see Steemit, which says 9 million users visit each month, in its rear-view mirror. But Kadavy is just one of hundreds of thousands of people who make money by posting, playing games and viewing ads on the new blockchain-based sites and apps, where nearly every user action is linked to token-based compensation.  More than 1,000 such projects that record data onto digital ledgers and are called dapps, for decentralized applications, are live or in testing. And they often let users earn their special coins or cryptocurrency by doing something they\u2019d already done for nothing on other sites.  Facebook and Twitter didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.  Worth Dollars  Some pre-blockchain sites let users tip content creators from their own funds. Very few did. Sites like Steemit give content creators a portion of newly minted tokens that are being mined all the time. Most of the tokens can be traded on exchanges, so they\u2019re worth something in dollars. And like Steem, many of these coins have appreciated. Steem stands at $3.55, up from 11 cents a year ago.  Tokens are a big reason why two-year-old Steemit already has about 100,000 content creators, according to Chief Executive Officer Ned Scott. It just broke into the top 1,000 of the web\u2019s biggest sites, according to tracker Alexa.  Steem Token's Market Cap In the Past Year In Billions of Dollars Source: CoinMarketCap.com  \u201cI attribute almost all of Steemit\u2019s growth to the reality it\u2019s distributed money to members of the community,\u201d Scott said in an interview. \u201cThere\u2019s been very little marketing. It\u2019s been all organic conversations that have led to the growth of the platform. A majority of the people who continue to stick around are being compensated for their time.\u201d  Financial Internet in Infancy  Scott, a former financial analyst for a food-importing company, got Steemit off the ground with a $250,000 angel investment. The site doesn\u2019t sell ads. Instead, it owns a portion of the issued tokens.  This new financial Internet is still in its infancy. It pays users a total of $3.5 million, but within two years, users could be paid $50 million a year, according to Susan Eustis, CEO of WinterGreen Research. The market could expand to $180 million within five years, she said in an email. Billionaire investor Tim Draper said that tokens and cryptocurrencies will grab 33 percent of all commerce in the next 10 years.  Sites such as Facebook and Twitter could benefit immediately by allowing users to tip content providers in Bitcoin, Draper, one of the world\u2019s biggest investors in digital money, said in an email.  Money for Playing  While games such as Zynga Inc.\u2019s FarmVille have long used virtual currencies, the money can\u2019t be taken out of the games. That\u2019s not the case with tokens. Services like Bancor can convert an obscure token into one that can be traded on an exchange. In a sign of the financial internet\u2019s traction, conversion volume on the Bancor network has climbed to more than $37 million per week in January from $3 million per week in November, according to the company.

Since starting to play the game in early 2018, he turned an investment of one Ether into 10 Ethers; each Ether is currently worth $868.  Obstacles stand in the way of the financial internet. New privacy rules in Europe require sites to erase user information under certain circumstances. That could be problematic, as the blockchain is immutable and usually can\u2019t be changed easily.  Digital ledgers could also make it difficult to take down libelous content because it lives forever there, said Samit Singh, CEO of Decentralized News Network, an online publisher that\u2019s in alpha testing.  More importantly, most digital ledgers have problems scaling as more users jump on board. Recently, Ethereum blockchain screeched to a halt as too many users began playing CryptoKitties.  \u201cThese decentralized systems are just not made to grow and scale for the masses yet,\u201d said Anthony Di Iorio, co-founder of Ethereum, said in an interview. \u201cThere are always problems with early technology.

A federal judge in San Francisco ruled Monday that the world\u2019s largest social network must face claims that it violated the privacy of millions of users by gathering and storing biometric data without their consent. Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google is fighting similar claims in federal court in Chicago.  U.S. District Judge James Donato\u2019s decision to let the class-action case proceed means that Facebook is still potentially on the hook for fines under a unique Illinois law of $1,000 to $5,000 each time a person\u2019s image is used without permission. A court victory for consumers could lead to new restrictions on Facebook\u2019s use of biometrics in the U.S., similar to those in Europe and Canada.  \u201cWhen an online service simply disregards the Illinois procedures, as Facebook is alleged to have done, the right of the individual to maintain her biometric privacy vanishes into thin air,\u201d Donato wrote in Monday\u2019s ruling. \u201cThe precise harm the Illinois legislature sought to prevent is then realized.\u201d  Donato previously rejected Facebook\u2019s argument that the case had to be dismissed because the attempt to enforce Illinois law runs afoul of its user agreement that requires disputes to be resolved under the laws of California, where it\u2019s based.  Facebook Says Users Can\u2019t Stop It From Using Biometric Data  Courts have struggled over what qualifies as an injury to pursue a privacy case in lawsuits accusing Facebook and Google of siphoning users\u2019 personal information from emails and monitoring their web browsing habits. Suits over selling the data to advertisers have often failed.  In 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court set a \u201cconcrete injury\u201d standard for privacy suits in a case involving search-engine operator Spokeo Inc., a ruling that both sides in the Facebook suit attempted to use to their advantage.  The Illinois residents who sued under the Biometric Information Privacy Act said the 2008 state law gives them a \u201cproperty interest\u201d in the algorithms that constitute their digital identities -- in other words, gives them grounds to accuse Facebook of real harm.  Facebook, which got the case moved to San Francisco from Illinois, argued the users hadn\u2019t suffered a concrete injury such as physical harm, loss of money or property; or a denial of their right to free speech or religion.  Donato concluded that the alleged violation of the user-consent requirement in the Illinois law goes to \u201cthe very privacy rights the Illinois legislature sought to protect.\u201d  \u201cThis injury is worlds away from the trivial harm of a mishandled zip code or credit card receipt,\u201d he wrote.  A spokeswoman for Facebook declined to comment on the ruling.

The proposal, written by Ellen Weintraub, a Democrat and vice chair of the commission, would require online advertisements to carry the same disclaimers from their sponsors as do radio, television and print ads. The commission will consider the framework, known as a notice of proposed rule making, at its next public hearing on March 8.  The move comes as tech companies face growing scrutiny in Washington ranging from concerns about market dominance to concerns that online platforms are used for sex trafficking of children.  Congress has been examining how Russians used social media platforms to influence the 2016 election, and bipartisan bills have been introduced in both the House and Senate that would require companies like Facebook and Google to disclose information about sponsors of political ads on their sites, including how much they\u2019re spending and what audiences the ads are focusing on.    FEC Disclaimers  Though the FEC proposal, which was shared by Weintraub, would apply to campaigns, political parties and other organizations that try to influence federal elections, tech companies could also be affected. They might have to adapt their platforms to accommodate the kind of disclaimers the FEC envisions.  In 2011, Facebook asked the FEC for an exemption from disclaimer rules because its ads used a \"sponsored\" tag that did not identify the sponsor, and did not necessarily link back to the sponsor\u2019s website. The election commission deadlocked on granting an exemption.  In the wake of revelations that Facebook, Google and other online sites were used by Russians in 2015 and 2016 to influence Americans on hot button social and political issues, the FEC reopened the rule making process to require more disclosure for online ads. The draft rule would require text and graphic ads to include the name of a sponsor \"in letters of sufficient size to be clearly readable.\"  Political ads on streaming music services or Internet radio stations would have to include oral disclaimers, while candidates buying online video and audio ads would have to state their names and add, \"And I approve of this message.\"  Paid Advertisements  The notice also seeks input on whether political organizations that use free services -- like uploading videos to YouTube -- should be required to say they are responsible for the ads. Under current law, disclaimers are only required on paid advertisements.  The notice, which will require the support of Republican commissioners to be adopted, also tries to anticipate how developing technologies, including virtual and augmented reality, should be regulated.  The last time the FEC issued a ruling on internet advertising was in 2006, the year after YouTube was founded. That ruling required individuals and committees buying online political ads to disclose how much they spent on the ads. It also called for a disclaimer for all \"paid Internet advertising placed on another person\u2019s website,\" such as banner ads. The requirement exempted other forms of Internet communications, such as blog posts.  The six-member commission, which enforces election laws, can include no more than three members from one party. Currently there are three Republicans, one Democrat and one independent. Lee Goodman, a Republican, is stepping down Friday, which will create two vacancies.

It's meant to be useful to special effects artists and anybody else working in film or virtual reality \u2014 \"flicks\" cleanly divide each frame in a movie, TV show, or video game in an easy-to-read, easy-to-use number.  Facebook has invented a new unit of time: The \"flick,\" equivalent to precisely one 705,600,000th of a second \u2014 larger than a nanosecond, and smaller than a microsecond.  It's short for \"frame tick,\" hinting at its cinematic origins, writes original inventor Christopher Horvath on GitHub.  As for why Facebook needs a new unit of time, it goes back to the social network's Oculus VR subsidiary and its larger bet on virtual reality. And for Horvath, formerly of the cinematic world at firms like Pixar, Weta Digital, and Industrial Light & Magic, it seems to have been something of a passion project.  In film, video games, and any other kind of visual, screen-based medium, creators have to think in split-seconds. Most movies, for instance, are shot at 24 frames per second, which means that the film displays 24 still images every second in a rapid sequence to give the illusion of motion.  The problem, as described by Horvath, is that the math gets messy when you try to work on one frame at a time. At 24 frames per second, or FPS, each frame is approximately .04166666667 seconds long, or 41666666.669 nanoseconds. Those numbers are inelegant, with endlessly repeating decimals. In turn, that can make life difficult for programmers and artists who are trying to work precisely at these scales.  That's where the Facebook flick comes in. It can represent a single frame at a nice, even number, at a whole variety of framerates. For instance, at the 24 FPS of most movies, each frame is 29,400,000 flicks. At 60 FPS, seen as a desirable framerate for action-packed video games, each frame is 11,760,000 flicks long. It's a clean number that can easily be divided or added up, without worrying about decimal points.  Facebook has actually released its documentation for the creation and use of flicks as open source, meaning that anybody can download it and add support for the unit into their own software.

Current users may be exposed to more Watch videos with Facebook's News Feed tweaks. Morgan Stanley's survey didn't include data on average time spent viewing Facebook Watch, but Watch video engagement could increase as Facebook prioritizes longer serialized content in the News Feed. This can help offset declining video views caused by Facebook's recently announced News Feed algorithm tweak, which de-prioritizes publisher content.  But Watch has a long way to go to catch up with YouTube viewership. Seventy-eight percent of respondents indicated they used YouTube in the past year, while this figure was just 43% for Facebook Watch. That's not surprising, as YouTube has been around since 2005 and claims over 1 billion daily video views. Nonetheless, the adoption figures of Watch indicate Facebook is achieving its goal of converting more of its users into \"lean-back\" video viewers, as opposed to users who passively consume short-form video in the News Feed. Facebook is poised to boost Watch viewership as it broadens its exclusive TV-like content library.

He says Facebook is a mature company, and may be plateauing.    Facebook shares could get slashed considerably, says Pivotal Research Group analyst, Brian Wieser.  Wieser, one of Facebook's biggest bears on Wall Street, has a $152 price target for the stock, about 16.5% below its current level of $177. The Wall Street consensus is at $224, according to Bloomberg data.  \"With every passing year, Facebook gets closer to the limits of growth,\" Wieser told Business Insider. He says most mature companies hit a plateau and see lower margins.  \"Look at Google,\" he added, comparing Facebook to the search giant, which is another mature tech company reliant on advertising revenue that may be plateauing. Google's fourth-quarter profit margin was 24%, compared with 25% for the same quarters in 2015 and 2016.  Wieser says, \"Facebook is overvalued,\" and that there are \"limits on growth which the investor community doesn't fully appreciate.\" Those limits pertain directly to the advertising dollars that brands will want to spend on Facebook in the near future.  \"Spending will further be impacted by practical limits to growth in budgets for advertising,\" Wieser wrote in a recent note. He added advertising spending \"remains as a key concern on the growth potential for digital media companies.\"  Furthermore, Facebook has been in the thick of a public debate concerning fake news. That has caused huge brands like Unilever to think about scaling back their ad spending on the platform.  Unilever Chief Marketing Officer Keith Weed threatened to withdraw some of his company's advertising budget from platforms like Facebook and Google, favoring \"responsible platforms,\" with \"responsible content.\"  But, according to Wieser, Unilever will continue its ad spending on Facebook if the company cleans up its content. \"Unilever will stay the course so long as Facebook, Google and others continue to make efforts to improve their platforms,\" he said.  The advertising industry, however, doesn't see those concerns as a real threat to Facebook's ad revenue. There are few alternatives for marketers, many in the industry say.

Walmart and McDonald's may have negative effects on society, according to a new survey of 2,000 Americans, but Facebook beats them both.

Facebook fit that criteria for 27% of respondents, coming in second behind Marlboro, which 43% of people said had negative effects. McDonald's and Walmart came in at 21% and 18%, respectively, while 36% of people said \"None of the above.\"  Tavis McGinn, founder of Honest Data, wrote on LinkedIn that the findings weren't entirely surprising, given how much negative press Facebook has received in recent months.  \"In the social sphere, people began to question the long-term impact of Facebook on the psychological well-being of users,\" McGinn wrote, noting that violent crimes and suicide have been broadcast on Facebook Live and that former Facebook executives have publicly condemned the platform as addictive and socially destructive.

Attn: CEO Matthew Segal tells Business Insider that Facebook is emphasizing loyal audiences, interactivity, and longer episodes.  Starting in the fall, Facebook began to greenlight a handful of second seasons for its TV-like \"Watch\" shows. And now \"We Need to Talk,\" Attn:'s relationship advice series starring Nev Schulman (of \"Catfish\" fame) and his wife Laura Perlongo, has gotten a 10-episode order.  Business Insider talked to Attn: CEO Matthew Segal about what it took to get a renewal from Facebook, which has been selective about the series that have made it past season one. Segal said the most important factor was this: \"a loyal, repeat audience.\"  \"I know it's something that Facebook's looking at,\" Segal explained. \"Can viewers return from one episode to the next in the habitual way that implies fandom.\"  This makes sense when you consider what Facebook wants Watch to be. The tech giant is focused on making the Watch tab something that doesn't just rely on the same behavior as the news feed. Facebook wants people to check back for new episodes, like they do on YouTube or traditional TV. (One Watch partner told Business Insider that Facebook would prefer a show with fewer \"views,\" if the audience were coming back week after week, and didn't rely on the virality of a particular episode.)  Talk to your viewers  Segal said the other big factor was the \"interactivity\" of a show. This leans into Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's new mandate of promoting meaningful interactions.  \"Before we went into production on season one, we had Nev and Laura ask people\" what dating topics to cover, Segal said. And in season two, Attn: is going deeper into the fan feedback aspect.  \"For season two it's going to be even more interactive,\" Segal said. \"We are literally going to ask users to comment on their own experiences, and advice.\" Segal said the hosts will ask the audience about topics like how to ask people out, changing gender roles, money troubles, and so on. And there will be segments on the show when Nev and Laura are responding to reader feedback in real-time (though the episodes won't be live).  \"We Need to Talk\" isn't the only show that has used interactivity to find success.  According to a Watch partner, Mike Rowe's show \"Returning the Favor\" has been used by Facebook as an example of a show that's doing really well. Rowe asks for fan feedback on every show. \"We've already proven the best way to get people interested in RTF is to ask them to program each episode,\" he recently told Tubefilter.  Simply bigger  Season two of \"We Need to Talk\" will also be longer, with episodes falling more in the 10-12 minute range versus 3-6 minutes.  \"We've hired a whole writers room for this season, and there's lot of jokes peppered in,\" Segal said, though some of the show is unscripted as well.  There is definitely a bigger budget for this season, though Segal didn't comment on the exact figure.

Facebook doesn't have much incentive to listen.  The company is already reticent about being seen as a media company and is moving away from the news business.  Media companies don't have a ton of leverage over Facebook or Google.  Plus the technological challenges involved in either getting paid or choking off Facebook are significant.  The newsrooms at the 'old media' Wall Street Journal and 'digital native' BuzzFeed may not see eye-to-eye on much, but suddenly their bosses have lots to bond over.  That's because, in one way or another, both News Corp. chairman Rupert Murdoch and BuzzFeed CEO Jonah Peretti believe that Facebook and Google aren't giving news organizations a fair deal. They want them to pay up for news stories shared on the platforms.  In each case, however, it's not clear whether any single news organization has serious leverage against the duopoly, or, as Business Insider's Nathan McAlone noted, the technical wherewithal to actually pull or block all of their content from either platform.  Still, it's not crazy to think that Facebook, in particular, could and probably should pay publishers to distribute their content. But who says they care enough or see what's in it for them?  Why should Facebook listen to Rupert Murdoch?  Murdoch doesn't make any explicit threats in his fiery note. It's easy to see why. What threat could he make? Could he pull down the New York Post's Facebook page tomorrow? Would people notice or care? This isn't like MTV going dark on a cable system in the 1990s, which would inevitably lead to fans calling their cable switchboard to complain.  More importantly, Murdoch couldn't stop people from posting New York Post articles to Facebook, could it? I asked Gabriele Boland, manager of content strategy at the social media analytics firm News Whip, and she said she's not sure how they would.Making links 'not shareable' is one potential way but that seems counterproductive. Publishers want people passing around their stories. One way to go would be for the New York Post to charge for everything,  \"A news site could extremely limit its own Facebook traffic by \"pay-walling\" their content,\" Boland said, noting that even a fully pay-walled property like the Financial Times still racks up tons of engagement on Facebook.  Ok, what about the idea that Facebook needs good content, that it's part of the reason people like hanging out there?  \"The publishers are obviously enhancing the value and integrity of Facebook through their news and content but are not being adequately rewarded for those services,\" Murdoch wrote on Monday.  Maybe this is true. But if anything, the tech giant seems to want to make news go away on Facebook, rather the get further into bed with it.  Murdoch has talked tough about this before  Back in 2009, Murdoch talked about blocking all of his company's news stories from Google search entirely. He had support in the \"Google is bad for news\" camp. Around that time, noted mogul Mark Cuban (\"Shark Tank\") called Google a \"vampire.\"  There was even industry chatter - believe it or not - that a bunch of news organizations could ban together and pull their content from Google searches in favor or Microsoft's Bing.  But alas, nobody went through with it, as it was likely way too scary to give up the traffic Google searches deliver.  The same kind of fears would be top of mind for anyone mulling a full Facebook boycott.  Here's the case for paying publishers, besides being a nice thing for the world  If you think about it, an exclusive programmed, strategy is exactly what Facebook is trying to do with Facebook Watch, where only partner companies can upload video and some are being paid by Facebook to do so. Thus it's not outside the realm of possibility that Facebook could do the same for news.  This kind of members-only approach could keep Facebook out of trouble. It would be an abrupt change, but what if you could only find content on Facebook from an approved set of limited, vetted partners?  This could be seen as a vital, pro-journalism, pro-democracy gesture by Facebook (which, you may recall, has recently had some unwanted meetings with Congress over its anti-democracy impact). And it could keep the company out of more fake news trouble in 2020.  Plus, Murdoch's right. It really wouldn't cost that much. \"Carriage payments would have a minor impact on Facebook's profits,\" he wrote. For a company that pulls in $10 billion-plus in revenue a quarter, a few checks to some newspapers is pocket change for Zuckerberg.  The case against paying is that it makes Facebook a media company  Facebook is by nature open. It's that Silicon Valley utopian ideal that makes Facebook Facebook. Do they really want to change that? \"At our heart we're a tech company,\" COO Sheryl Sandberg told Axios last October.  After all, people like what they like, whether its fake news or mean stories about Trump. Who is Facebook to say they can't share conspiracy theories or the like?  Allison Shelley/Getty Images  Plus, does Facebook want to manage another few hundred publisher relationships on top of what it's doing with Watch? At least with Watch, the promise is hitting Google's YouTube where it hurts and ultimately stealing some TV ad budgets. Watch is a relatively small project (Facebook is spending about $1 billion on it).  Becoming the Internet's curated newsstand (Facebook Read anyone?) is a whole other level. It makes Facebook a media distributor much like Comcast. Which is exactly where it doesn't want to be.  Lastly, paying a select group of publishers probably won't do much for Facebook's bottom line. And that's usually the bottom line.", "stock": "FB", "label": 1, "date": "2018-01-22", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/rupert-murdoch-may-be-right-about-facebook-paying-media-companies-2018-1"}, {"article": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg delivers the keynote address at Facebook's F8 Developer Conference on April 18, 2017 at McEnery Convention Center in San Jose, California. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images  Facebook is now directing users to download a VPN called Onavo for \"protection.\"  The VPN is owned by Facebook, and sends information about your app usage habits to the company.  Facebook has used this tool for a competitive advantage against other mobile apps.  Critics say Facebook isn't clear enough about its ownership of Onavo.  Under the pretense of protecting your account, Facebook is telling users download to a Facebook-owned app that tracks what you do on your phone \u2014 and sends that information back to Facebook.  TechCrunch first noticed on Tuesday that Facebook added a menu item, called \"protect,\" to its iPhone and iOS app. Clicking it takes users directly to the App Store listing of a Virtual Private Network (VPN) app called Onavo Protect, which is owned by Facebook.  Facebook bought Onavo, an Israeli company, in 2013. Since then, Facebook has been using the data collected from the service to keep tabs on how people use the apps on their phones, even when they're not using Facebook.  For example, the company used Onavo to see that Snapchat saw declining usage after Facebook introduced the competing Instagram Stories feature, The Wall Street Journal reported. It was also data from Onavo that reportedly inspired Facebook to launch a group video chat feature to its Messenger app\u2014 stymying a smaller app called Houseparty, which provided a very similar feature.  However, critics say that Facebook isn't clear enough about its affiliation with Onavo, implying that users might never know that the company uses the data from the app for such purposes.  Facebook did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment. Erez Naveh, Product Manager at Onavo, told TechCrunch that the app collects mobile data traffic to \"help us recognize tactics that bad actors use.\" Naveh also noted that the app lets people know it collects data before users download it.  Here's what Onavo actually does \u2014 and why people are upset that Facebook is pushing it.  Facebook's Onavo is a Virtual Private Network, or VPN  Onavo is a Virtual Private Network, or a VPN.  There are several VPNs out there, and they essentially all do the same thing: route your internet traffic through a third-party server.  Facebook's iOS app now displays a \"protect\" option that links directly to Onavo's App Store listing. Screenshot  This allows users to to mask their browsing activity from Internet Service Providers, like Comcast and AT&T. It can also make your computer look like it's in a different location, depending on where the third-party server is. Typically, VPNs themselves encrypt your traffic, making it harder for people to snoop on your activity.  Many VPNs are paid services \u2014 the popular AnchorFree Hotspot Shield, for instance, charges $13 a month, or $120 a year. Others, like Onavo Protect, are totally free for (mostly) unlimited usage.  When users download Onavo, they give Facebook permission to collect their mobile data traffic. Because Facebook owns Onavo, Facebook gets access to that data. This means that while your ISP won't see what apps you're using, Facebook will. If you're using Onavo, and you spend two hours on Twitter a day, Facebook can see that.  Why does this have people worried?  The major criticism of Onavo Protect is that Facebook isn't clear enough about its affiliation with the app. Unless you tap the \"Read More\" button in the App Store description of Onavo, you might never know it was actually owned by Facebook itself.  \"As part of this process, Onavo collects your mobile data traffic. This helps us improve and operate the Onavo service by analyzing your use of websites, apps and data. Because we're part of Facebook, we also use this info to improve Facebook products and services, gain insights into the products and services people value, and build better experiences,\" the description of the app reads.  The average user may not read the entire app description and download the service without knowing that it is giving Facebook access to your mobile browsing data, say critics.  John Gruber, a prominent Apple blogger, called Onavo \"spyware,\" likening it malicious software that hackers deploy to spy on users. Dell Cameron, a reporter at Gizmodo, called the VPN service \"vampiric\" and told readers not to download the app.  Facebook already has issues with eroding public trust, amid its public struggles with fake news, propaganda, and misinformation spreading through the social network. The perception that the company is pushing what's seen as a way to spy on users may not be the best look.", "stock": "FB", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-14", "source": "business-insider", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-facebooks-onavo-protect-virtual-private-network-app-2018-2"}, {"article": "Lucy Nicholson/Reuters  Snap shares were rising on news that it was taking younger users away from Facebook, according to the marketing firm eMarketer.  Still, Facebook was adding total monthly users, though mostly from an older cohort.  Snap is poised to add more users this year than ever given its new app redesign.  Watch Snap's stock trade in real time here.    Snap shares were gaining ground after a report found that Facebook was losing younger users at a faster clip to Snapchat than previously expected.  Snap's stock was up 2.23% on Monday morning at $19.22 a share.  \"While the social media platform was able to count on Instagram to retain that younger audience in the past, Snapchat may now be siphoning away more users,\" according to the eMarketer study.  Social media companies have closely monitored millennials, particularly teenagers, because they represent a large base of sustainable growth.  Yet Facebook is still popular among older age groups, adding monthly users overall. The New York-based marketing firm eMarketer believes Facebook will add around 1% more users in 2018, compared to the previous year.  However, the study found that Facebook will lose 9.3% of US Facebook users between ages 11 and younger. Meanwhile, the number of Facebook users ages 12 to 17 will decline by 5.6% and users aged 18 to 24 will fall by 5.8% in 2018. Facebook would lose up to 2 million users under the age of 24 this year, according to the eMarketer study.  Facebook's stock was up 0.82% at $177.55 per share ahead of Monday's opening bell.  \u201cSnapchat could eventually experience more growth in older age groups, since it\u2019s redesigning its platform to be easier to use,\u201d eMarketer principal analyst Debra Aho Williamson stated in a release. \u201cThe question will be whether younger users will still find Snapchat cool if more of their parents and grandparents are on it. That\u2019s the predicament Facebook is in.\u201d  Snapchat may see its user base grow by 9.3% to 86.5 million this year, eMarketer added.  Shares of Snap have been trading higher after the company reported blockbuster fourth-quarter earnings last week. Snap's stock was up 25.79% for the year.

As with other third-party apps, you can remove it from your phone with a few taps.  If you use Messenger on a phone running a recent version of Android, open the Settings icon and select Apps & Notifications. Find the Messenger icon; if you do not see it, tap See All Apps (or App Info) first. Tap the Uninstall option. You can also delete an app from the Android home screen by pressing its icon and then dragging it to the Uninstall symbol that appears at the top of the screen.  Photo  You can also remove Android apps by opening the Google Play store icon on your phone, tapping the three-lined menu icon in the top-left corner and selecting My Apps & Games.

The changes have left investors wondering whether people will still spend as much time on the site and whether brands will continue placing as many digital ads there.  On Wednesday, Facebook sought to soothe Wall Street\u2019s worries over those questions. No, people will not spend as much time on the site, the company said as it reported quarterly financial results. But don\u2019t worry, Facebook added, because the changes will ultimately benefit its business.  With the adjustments to what it shows on its site, \u201cI believe that the time spent on Facebook will be more valuable,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said in a conference call with analysts. \u201cIf people interact more, it should lead to stronger community. When you care about something, you\u2019re willing to see ads to experience it.\u201d  The scrutiny followed changes that Facebook announced in January to its News Feed, the scrolling screen of content that the social network\u2019s more than two billion members see when they log in to the site. After months of criticism over the harmful effects of the social network, Mr. Zuckerberg said Facebook wanted to emphasize more \u201cmeaningful\u201d content, such as photos and posts that friends and family have interacted with, and would play down articles from publishers. At the time, Mr. Zuckerberg acknowledged that the shift might cause people to spend less time on Facebook, at least in the short run.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  That has already proven to be true in some instances, Facebook revealed on Wednesday. The shift to more meaningful content has just started rolling out, but the company made other changes last year as a precursor to the latest moves, including cutting down on viral videos. In response, Facebook users over all reduced the time they spent on the platform by roughly 50 million hours a day, Mr. Zuckerberg said, which translates to about two minutes a day for each of the company\u2019s 1.4 billion daily users.", "stock": "FB", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-01", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/31/technology/facebook-news-feed.html"}, {"article": "But Mr. Stretch added that this content was a smidgen of the total content available across Facebook:  \u201cThis equals about four-thousandths of 1 percent (0.004 percent) of content in News Feed, or approximately one out of 23,000 pieces of content.\u201d  And on Friday, Rob Goldman, Facebook\u2019s vice president for ads, noted that more than half of the Russian Facebook ads (56 percent) were served after the 2016 election.  Quoting tiny fractions suggests content on Facebook gets drowned out in a torrent of information. But the company\u2019s whole business model is based on giving ads and posts prominence in the feeds of well-targeted users.  Questions for Facebook:  Has Facebook performed any analyses that looks at smaller groups of people? If so, can Facebook share them? And how did the ads perform before and after the election?  To what extent did Russia target swing states?  Mr. Mueller\u2019s latest indictment says that, after the middle of 2016, Russians often talked about targeting \u201cpurple states,\u201d or those in which the number of Republican and Democratic voters are close. The indictment also describes the Russians as focused on Florida, which Mr. Trump ended up winning.  \u201cOn or about August 4, 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators created and purchased Facebook advertisements for the \u2018Florida Goes Trump\u2019 rally. The advertisements reached over 59,000 Facebook users in Florida, and over 8,300 Facebook users responded to the advertisements by clicking on it.\u201d  Others have asserted in the past that Russia did not appear to focus its social media efforts on swing states. As Senator Richard Burr, Republican of North Carolina and chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, noted last year:  \u201cWhat you haven\u2019t heard is that almost five times more ads were targeted at Maryland than Wisconsin. Maryland, which was targeted by 262 ads in comparison to Wisconsin\u2019s 55, wasn\u2019t up for grabs; it was a state the Democratic candidate carried by 26 percent.\u201d  Questions for Facebook:  Do the company\u2019s records show that Russia-backed ads and posts reached a higher number of people in certain states or regions of the United States? If so, how responsive were Facebook users in those targeted regions to the Russian posts and ads?  The Russia-backed groups were incredibly successful at gaining followers.  Jonathan Albright, research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia, has done revealing work on Facebook\u2019s Russia-linked pages that is more detailed than anything the company has made public. Mr. Albright\u2019s data, obtained using CrowdTangle, an analytics tool owned by Facebook, shows the speed with which the Russia-backed groups grew.  Blacktivist, a Russia-linked group whose often inflammatory content set it apart from legitimate groups championing African-American rights, had 14,000 followers at the end of 2015. By the time its Facebook page was shut down last year, it had 390,000, according to Mr. Albright\u2019s data \u2014 a hugely successful ramp up that took Blacktivist\u2019s total followers above that for Black Lives Matter. Other Russian-created groups, like Heart of Texas, also showed huge increases in followers.  Questions for Facebook:  How exactly were these groups able to scoop up so many members so quickly? Did the speed of the increases wave any red flags internally at Facebook? To what extent did Facebook\u2019s ad targeting tools, which allow advertisers to reach specific groups of people, enable Russia to put incendiary posts in the feeds of certain groups? And one from Mr. Albright: What were the follower totals and other data for any private Facebook pages that were backed by the Russians?  Why this issue isn\u2019t going away for Facebook.  It may well be the case that Russian disinformation did not swing the election for Mr. Trump. But it may have had far more of an impact than the public knows. And Facebook is almost certainly sitting on data that could deepen the nation\u2019s understanding of what went on.  \u201cI can\u2019t imagine what it would it look like if we had all the data,\u201d Mr. Albright said.", "stock": "FB", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-20", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/20/business/dealbook/facebook-russia-questions.html"}, {"article": "Now, Facebook is in the uncomfortable position of reining in an off-message executive, while clarifying that it didn\u2019t mean to bolster the president\u2019s position.  \u201cThe special counsel has issued its indictments, and nothing we found contradicts their conclusions,\u201d Joel Kaplan, Facebook\u2019s vice president of global policy, said in a statement. \u201cAny suggestion otherwise is wrong.\u201d  Photo  Mr. Goldman did not respond to requests for comment, and the company declined to make him available for an interview.  It is Facebook\u2019s right to defend itself, of course. The company has faced a raft of accusations of wrongdoing, some of which have indeed been overblown. Facebook was not the only social network manipulated by Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency, the company at the heart of Mr. Mueller\u2019s indictment. And other companies, such as Twitter and YouTube, certainly share the blame for fostering a media ecosystem in which false news and propaganda can flourish.  But Mr. Goldman\u2019s tweetstorm was unintentionally revealing. It showed that, years after hostile foreign actors first began using Facebook to wage an information war against the American public, some high-ranking officials within the company still don\u2019t understand just how central Facebook was to Russia\u2019s misinformation campaign, and how consequential the company\u2019s mistakes have been. (Last year, in a tweet that fewer people saw, Andrew Bosworth, another Facebook vice president, claimed that the effects of Russian interference and fake news in 2016 were \u201cmarginal, even in a close election.\u201d)  In real-world terms, a part of Facebook still sees itself as the bank that got robbed, rather than the architect who designed a bank with no safes, and no alarms or locks on the doors, and then acted surprised when burglars struck.

Even before Mr. Goldman\u2019s tweets were blasted along to Mr. Trump\u2019s 48 million followers, they lacked crucial context about what exactly Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation had found. He made sweeping pronouncements about the misuse of Facebook\u2019s advertising products while neglecting to mention that most of Russia\u2019s exploitation took the form of nonadvertising posts. He claimed that swinging the election in Mr. Trump\u2019s favor was not a primary goal of Russia\u2019s Facebook campaign, when Mr. Mueller\u2019s indictment had just concluded that it was. He portrayed Facebook as having been eager to promote its findings on the Russia investigation, when in fact the company has made disclosures only under pressure from regulators, and has deliberately hidden data about Russia\u2019s interference from outside researchers.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Some of Mr. Goldman\u2019s claims may have been narrowly true, but they were a prime example of misdirection. Why is educating citizens about digital literacy the solution to misinformation, as Mr. Goldman suggested, rather than fixing the tech platforms that make misinformation hard to distinguish from truth? Why should it reassure us that most of Russia\u2019s Facebook advertising was purchased after the election, rather than telling us that Facebook continued to drop the ball even after it knew it had a Russia problem?  More than anything, the details contained in the indictment make clear how vulnerable Facebook still is to a hostile actor. None of the safeguards it has announced so far \u2014 such as providing more transparency about political ads, or using snail-mail postcards to verify the identities of certain political advertisers \u2014 would stop a sophisticated and well-funded foreign influence operation. And many of the tactics the Internet Research Agency used in 2016 \u2014 including posing as American citizens to create large partisan Facebook pages and organizing offline rallies with the help of American co-conspirators \u2014 would be just as effective today.  In a recent cover story, Wired detailed the soul-searching journey that Facebook\u2019s executives have undertaken since the 2016 election. First, they denied that they\u2019d done anything wrong. Then, after the scope of Russia\u2019s misinformation campaign became clear, they circled the wagons to protect the company\u2019s reputation and appease its critics. Only recently have certain executives, like Mark Zuckerberg, its chief executive, come to appreciate the scale and scope of Facebook\u2019s errors, and publicly accept responsibility for them.  We may never get answers about what Facebook knew of the Russian interference campaign in 2016, and why it didn\u2019t act more forcefully to stop it. (Trust me, I\u2019ve tried.) But it\u2019s deeply troubling that eight months before the 2018 midterms, as malicious forces continue to use social media to sow discord and meddle in elections all over the world, some at Facebook seem more interested in defending themselves from criticism than owning their mistakes, fixing their platform\u2019s problems and protecting our democracy.", "stock": "FB", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-19", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/19/technology/russia-facebook-trump.html"}, {"article": "Mr. Sam Rainsy\u2019s petition cites leaked emails purporting to show that at one point, Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s Cambodian People\u2019s Party was paying Facebook $15,000 per day to promote its pages.

The opposition recruited a team to report and broadcast news shows entirely on Facebook, and used young social media stars to encourage attendance at antigovernment protests. (The opposition and its supporters also used the site to spread false rumors, as well as racist claims about Vietnamese living in Cambodia.)  Mr. Hun Sen seemed to learn his lesson. The premier and his family assembled a team to disseminate pro-government propaganda and pour money into promoting their own pages on Facebook, which is one of the country\u2019s most popular sources of information. Government ministries, all of which are run by Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s party, were ordered to form \u201cFacebook working groups,\u201d and officials were told to start their own personal pages to interact with the public.  However his \u201clikes\u201d were generated, Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s Facebook page now has more of them than any other in Cambodia. On it, he intersperses policy dictates and slick propaganda videos with slices of everyday life: photographs of him in an undershirt on the beach, in bed with his wife, and hugging garment factory workers. In speeches posted to his page, he rails against his political opponents and threatens that war will ensue if he ever loses power, while also offering folksy musings and updates on his health.  Duong Dara, who manages Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s Facebook presence, said Mr. Sam Rainsy\u2019s petition revealed a misunderstanding of the nature of advertising.

Photo  Back Story  On this day in 1887, Harvey Wilcox, a real estate developer from Kansas, filed a plan with Los Angeles County for a small, gridded subdivision that he called Hollywood. (The origin of the name is a subject of dispute.)  Over the next decade, Mr. Wilcox and his wife, Daeida, conjured out of the desert a strict Christian community of orchards and Victorian cottages, connected to Los Angeles by a lone streetcar line.  Photo  There were just a few hundred residents, and the hamlet banned alcohol, bowling alleys and even, briefly, movie theaters. But in 1910, Hollywood voted to merge with Los Angeles.  Soon, movie studios fled the enforcement of Thomas Edison\u2019s monopoly on film patents and started setting up in the ideal Southern California light.  In 1923, the Hollywoodland sign went up (it was truncated to Hollywood in 1949). The original sign was an illuminated billboard for a segregated housing development that called itself a fortress against \u201cmetropolitanism\u201d; one ad urged, \u201cProtect your family.\u201d  The sign was left up as the so-called Golden Age of Hollywood arrived, a noirish era embodied by the starlet Peg Entwistle, who jumped to her death from the H in 1932.

One study, published by researchers at the University of Oregon in 2016, found that the use of image-based platforms like Instagram and Snapchat was associated with lower levels of loneliness among users, and higher levels of happiness and satisfaction, while text-based platforms had no correlation with improved mental health.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  A heavily visual platform also makes a relatively poor conduit for breaking news and in-the-moment commentary, which might explain why Instagram often feels less exhausting than other social networks. (It also explains why last month, before I went on vacation, I deleted every social media app from my phone except Instagram \u2014 the only app I trusted not to ruin my beachside calm.)  Lesson No. 2: Rethink the share button.  One of Instagram\u2019s most underrated virtues is that it has imposed structural limits on virality \u2014 the ability of a given post to spread beyond its intended audience. Unlike Twitter and Facebook, on Instagram there is no native sharing function, meaning that the reach of most Instagram posts is capped at the number of people who follow the user\u2019s account. (There are ways to \u201cregram\u201d someone else\u2019s photo using a third-party app, but they\u2019re clunky, and relatively few people use them. Instagram also recently began showing users posts from people they don\u2019t follow, a Facebook-inspired change that I\u2019d argue is a mistake.)

View all New York Times newsletters.  A native share button has been tremendously useful for Facebook\u2019s and Twitter\u2019s growth. It has also allowed upstart media organizations like BuzzFeed and Upworthy to build enormous audiences by specializing in highly shareable stories. But ease of sharing has also allowed the loudest and most emotional voices to be rewarded with clicks \u2014 and attention. It\u2019s this incentive structure that has allowed partisans and profiteers to hijack Facebook\u2019s algorithms and spread divisive messages and false news to millions of people.  The easy virality of Facebook also seems to have made individual users more hesitant about opening up. That makes sense \u2014 it\u2019s easier to share a selfie if you know it won\u2019t accidentally find its way into the feeds of a million strangers.  Lesson No. 3: Ban links.  Instagram\u2019s greatest structural advantage, though, may be a result of its decision to go mostly link-free. Links in Instagram captions and comments aren\u2019t clickable, and while some users have found workarounds, the vast majority of Instagram posts aren\u2019t meant to send users to outside websites. (The exceptions are ads, which can contain clickable links and are, not coincidentally, the most troubled part of Instagram\u2019s platform.)  Photo  The walled-garden nature of Instagram has frustrated publishers, who want to send followers out to their websites, where the publishers can earn advertising money and \u201ccontrol the reader experience.\u201d (It\u2019s really just about the money.) But Instagram has wisely refused to give in, perhaps realizing that allowing links might turn the platform into a screeching bazaar, with publishers and pages all doing circus acts for clicks.  Removing links from Facebook would wreak havoc on the digital media industry, which has built an economic model around referral traffic from Facebook. It would also risk alienating some users, who enjoy promoting and discussing stories from other parts of the internet. But it would also solve some of the platform\u2019s most vexing challenges. And ultimately, it would be better for the world.  After all, malicious actors don\u2019t post fabricated news, wildly exaggerated headlines or partisan outrage-bait on Facebook only for fun. They do it, in many cases, because it\u2019s profitable. Take away bad actors\u2019 incentives and they\u2019ll go elsewhere.  Banning most links doesn\u2019t seem to have hurt Instagram as a business. It had more than 800 million monthly active users as of September, and it gained a million new advertisers last year. Facebook doesn\u2019t break out Instagram\u2019s revenue, but some analysts expect the app could one day generate as much as $10 billion in annual revenue. That\u2019s still nowhere near Facebook, which earned $10 billion in revenue last quarter alone, but it\u2019s a meaningful number, and it shows that insularity isn\u2019t always a bad thing.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Lesson No. 4: Bad actors are unavoidable, but their influence can be contained.  Instagram is far from a perfect social network, and copying it wouldn\u2019t fix all of Facebook\u2019s problems overnight.

David Kaye, the United Nations\u2019 Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression, said that Facebook would probably face more difficult questions as it rolled out the new ranking program globally.  \u201cWhat will happen in situations where a community determines that a news source is trustworthy, but that news source is censored, or illegal, in that country?\u201d asked Mr. Kaye, noting that in many parts of the world, governments controlled all official news channels while independent news sources were outlawed or forced to publish pseudo-anonymously.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  In the past, he added, Facebook has abided by local rules where it operates abroad.  \u201cWhat will Mark Zuckerberg do when the needs of the community, in what it determines is trusted news, are different from what the government determines. Who will Facebook side with?\u201d said Mr. Kaye.  Raju Narisetti, the chief executive of the Gizmodo Media Group, the unit of Univision that operates Jezebel and other sites, said there was a \u201cgreat irony\u201d that Facebook, which has traditionally left decision up to an algorithm that incorporates the behaviors of its members, would open the decision-making to its users on such a matter. He added that the user-generated ranking system \u201cis a massive abdication of its social responsibility, as a vital platform, to be a good custodian of the Fourth Estate globally.\u201d  Other experiments that Facebook has tried with news in the past have sometimes gone awry or had unintended consequences. For example, a recent test to remove all news publishers from the News Feed and to place them under a separate tab in six countries, including Bolivia and Slovakia, yielded an unexpected result of magnifying the amount of fake news on the platform.  In his post on Friday, Mr. Zuckerberg said the newest change \u201cwill only shift the balance of news you see towards sources that are determined to be trusted by the community.\u201d  Facebook said news would be prioritized according to the new ranking system starting Monday, before expanding globally. Some Facebook users have already been asked to rank the trustworthiness of news sites which appear on the social network. In one survey, people were asked if they recognized a number of websites and then asked, \u201c\u201cHow much do you trust each of these domains?\u201d They were able to choose from a range of answers, including entirely, a lot, somewhat, barely and not at all.  The Silicon Valley company said it would continue polling users to refine and select which news outlets garnered the most trust. It declined to say how many people were polled or which news outlets they were asked about.  \u201cAs part of our ongoing quality surveys, we asked a diverse and representative sample of Facebook users across the U.S. to gauge their familiarity with, and trust in, sources of news,\u201d said Todd Breasseale, a Facebook spokesman. \u201cWe boost links from sources with high trust scores and demote links from sources with low trust scores.\u201d  Mr. Zuckerberg has been moving Facebook toward taking more responsibility for what shows up on the social network, especially after the criticism over the 2016 election and the interference by Russian agents. Earlier this month, he described his 2018 goals as including \u201cmaking sure that time spent on Facebook is time well spent.\u201d  In Friday\u2019s post, he hinted that ranking the credibility of news sources was just one step, with more potential changes to come.

The world of cryptocurrencies, which people have flooded into as prices soared in recent months, has also increasingly raised fears that parts of the market are dogged by scams. The Securities and Exchange Commission said Tuesday that it had halted what may have been a fraudulent initial coin offering that asked people to fund what was supposed to be the world\u2019s first \u201cdecentralized bank.\u201d  Rob Leathern, a Facebook product management director, announced the ban on cryptocurrency ads in a blog post.

Back Story  On this day in 1972, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Eisenstadt v. Baird that it\u2019s unconstitutional for a state to deny unmarried people access to contraception.  The court had ruled earlier, in 1965, that state bans on contraceptives for married couples violated their privacy rights. But a few states still restricted access for single people.  Photo  Bill Baird, an activist, violated one such law in Massachusetts. He appealed his conviction to the Supreme Court, which struck down the law.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Justice William Brennan held that the law violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment because it discriminated between married and unmarried people.  The case became an important precedent for landmark rulings by the Supreme Court, including the 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade that recognized abortion rights, and, more recently, the 2015 decision guaranteeing a right to same-sex marriage.  A movie about Mr. Baird\u2019s case is in development.  Mr. Baird has continued working as an activist, but his legacy is complicated by what The Times described in 1993 as an \u201cunapologetic zealotry\u201d and a willingness to criticize \u201ceven his ideologic allies.\u201d Planned Parenthood once called him an \u201cembarrassment.\u201d  Jillian Rayfield contributed reporting.  _____  Your Morning Briefing is published weekdays and updated all morning.

Photo: Stephen Lam/REUTERS  What do Facebook Inc., FB 0.40% the Soviet Union and the European Reformation have in common? They all consist of networks that formed quickly by leveraging new communications technologies and then just as swiftly were taken over by a handful of people who consolidated their influence over millions of people.  Some historians and scientists are coming to understand that the internet\u2014and specifically Facebook\u2014are only the latest examples of the revolution-spawning networks, common throughout history, that give rise to hierarchies that both empower and oppress.  In an indictment released Friday, special prosecutor Robert Mueller described a scenario in which Russian operatives allegedly exploited Facebook with the intent of influencing the 2016 U.S. election. That Facebook could be used in this way should be no surprise, because research has shown that the downside of powerful, centralized networks is their susceptibility to being subverted and exploited.  As recently as the Arab Spring in 2011, sober-sounding intellectuals could plausibly argue that the disruptive force of the internet, capable of upending old hierarchies, would provide the means to spread democracy and grant new freedoms.  That view, said historian Niall Ferguson, author of the 2018 book \u201cThe Square and the Tower: Networks and Power, From the Freemasons to Facebook,\u201d was born of an all-too-common mistake: the failure to appreciate that, even when new technologies come along, it\u2019s still humans who are using them.  \u201cFrom 1990s slogans about how we\u2019re all \u2018netizens\u2019 to the recent Facebook talk of a global community, we\u2019ve heard this argument ad nauseam,\u201d Mr. Ferguson said. \u201cAnd I think it has slightly robbed us of our critical faculties.\u201d  Understanding why this happens\u2014why networks start out as distributed power structures but quickly become vertical hierarchies capable of rapidly disseminating both information and propaganda\u2014requires a little network theory and some historical perspective.  A woman surrounded by images of Vladimir Lenin at \u2018The Epoch of Lenin\u2019 a private museum in Polotsk, Belarus, owned by collector Nikolai Pankrat, in October. Photo: sergei gapon/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images  Take the Bolshevik revolutions of 1917, for instance. The coalition of the armed forces and the industrial workforce that overthrew the czar was, essentially, a distributed network. But the circle of insiders who subsequently consolidated power over the Communist Party\u2014whose control peaked with the rule of Joseph Stalin\u2014is the hierarchy.  \u201cA hierarchy is just a special kind of network where some nodes have higher centrality\u2014the ones through which others have to communicate or pass,\u201d Mr. Ferguson said.  Technology usually plays a role in revolutionary change. In Russia, it was telegraphs and railroads. In the case of the Reformation, the printing press allowed for the rapid spread of the Bible in local languages. The distributed network of believers posed a sudden threat to the established Catholic hierarchy, yet once Protestantism achieved critical mass, its own hierarchy arose.  With the printed vernacular bible, Martin Luther envisioned a network of believers in Europe but not 200 years of civil war. Photo: ullstein bild/Getty Images  \u201cLuther thought that it would be great if everyone was connected and could read the Bible in the vernacular,\u201d Mr. Ferguson said. What Luther didn\u2019t anticipate is what would come next\u2014nearly 200 years of civil war.  \u201cWhat happened in the 16th century in Europe is visible in American politics today, where you have two pretty hostile and separate spheres of conservatives and liberals who are scarcely communicating across a largely vacated middle,\u201d Mr. Ferguson said.  To see how the power of nation- or globe-spanning networks can be exploited, look at China\u2019s transformation of its internet into the world\u2019s most sophisticated machine for censorship, surveillance and social control.  The distributed nature of the internet should have posed a major threat to a country like China. As internet activist John Gilmore once said, \u201cThe net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it.\u201d  Recognizing this, China built its portion of the internet from the start as a hierarchy in which internet companies can only rent bandwidth from government-controlled service providers. In other words, all traffic is routed through a limited number of powerful, central nodes.  China's President Xi Jinping is seen on a screen in front of logos of China's leading internet companies at the World internet Conference in Wuzhen, in China\u2019s Zhejiang province, in December. Photo: aly song/Reuters  Even when networks aren\u2019t architected for this kind of control, they tend to organize themselves in ways that lead to disproportionate influence by a handful of their members. When any new person or entity joins a network, it is likely to attach to the most visible hubs, making them even more influential, said Albert-L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Barab\u00e1si, a theoretical physicist and a founder of the field of network science.  In just a few years, Facebook became the world\u2019s most dominant conduit of news and information but said it would remain neutral to what spread through its channels. Meanwhile, a handful of engineers were building algorithms to decide which of its 2.2 billion users would see what.  By remaining agnostic about which influencers rose to popularity, and helping them along by building recommendation and newsfeed algorithms to enhance that popularity, Facebook allowed Russia to rapidly gain influence on the site, said Nicholas Christakis, a physician and sociologist at Yale who studies social networks.  The company has taken steps to address these problems, but it\u2019s Facebook\u2019s \u201coriginal sin\u201d\u2014to optimize for engagement above all else as a servant of advertisers as much as of users\u2014that is at the root of its issues, Dr. Christakis said.  According to Dr. Christakis, \u201cYou can connect a group of people one way and they\u2019re kind, and cooperation spreads. But if you take the same group of people and connect them in a different way, they\u2019re mean sons of bitches, and they\u2019re cruel to each other.\u201d  Facebook isn\u2019t the only internet power structure like this, of course. All the top social networks that use algorithmic feeds to feature content have been exploited in similar ways. Alphabet Inc.\u2019s YouTube recently came under fire for allowing its artificial intelligence to promote extremist views. And in Friday\u2019s indictment, Mr. Mueller named Twitter Inc. and Facebook-owned Instagram as well.  Historically, the only way to deal with this problem has been to disrupt an established network with a fresh one. Fostering competition could shift power away from Facebook. Yet many have begun to argue that Facebook, with its dominance of social media, should be treated as a monopoly, and even broken up. One could argue that the grounds for doing so now include national security.

Investors are apparently shocked that big tech companies that have long received political protection from liberals are suddenly getting the Big Oil rubdown.  Over the weekend two newspapers reported that the political firm Cambridge Analytica harvested data from 50 million Facebook users by using a personality test app. Ted Cruz used the firm in 2015 to target voters, and the Trump campaign later marshalled its \u201cpsychographic\u201d modelling\u2014a meld of social science and psychology.  The Obama campaign pioneered using Facebook data to boost turnout. Facebook itself exploits personal information, and its data trove is why it captures nearly 20% of the digital advertising market. But Cambridge Analytica may have misrepresented its purpose to users and Facebook, a violation of the platform\u2019s policy. Politicians are outraged nonetheless. During the Obama years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies enjoyed a halo effect. But since Donald Trump\u2019s election, Democrats have discovered that tech can be used for malicious purposes\u2014such as helping Donald Trump. Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar and California Rep. Adam Schiff have called for an investigation of Facebook data controls, and more political scrutiny is sure to come. This week the Senate is expected to pass legislation that would allow trial lawyers and state attorneys general to charge internet companies for allegedly abetting sex-trafficking. This represents an erosion of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which shields companies like Facebook and Google from liability for crimes committed by their users. It\u2019s only a matter of time before other crimes are exempted from Section 230. Mr. Trump is no fan of Big Tech, so watch out if Democrats win Congress. The European Commission this week also plans to propose a tax on digital ad revenue and the sale of digital data to third parties. This could slam U.S. tech profits, especially if lawmakers in Washington follow.

Corporate consultants would normally regard such communication as sub-optimal, but today\u2019s late rally on Wall Street suggests that investors are looking beyond the bit fight. The Journal reports:  The pullbacks were the result of bad publicity. Separately the Journal explains why investors are willing to overlook a lot of bad headlines among the technology companies in the S&P 500:  They are expected to post 22% earnings growth in the first quarter, which would be a strong showing even for a sector that typically grows its earnings quite rapidly.  Much of the media has lately been having fun pretending that a company called Cambridge Analytica, making unauthorized use of personal data from Facebook, played an important role in persuading people to vote for Donald Trump in 2016.  In recent trading sessions, the dubious argument has had real consequences as investors have marked down the value of Facebook and other tech companies by billions of dollars. The thesis among sellers of such stocks is that the Washington swamp will now impose expensive regulation to punish Facebook for allegedly being useful to Mr. Trump.

Other tech leaders have remained quiet in the ensuing backlash against Facebook, in contrast to Silicon Valley\u2019s usual practice of rallying around its own during major crises.  Apple\u2019s Mr. Cook has offered perhaps the sharpest critique of Facebook\u2019s data collection, saying last week: \u201cThe truth is, we could make a ton of money if we monetized our customer \u2014 if our customer was our product. We\u2019ve elected not to do that.\u201d  In an interview posted this week on Vox, a website for young adults, Mr. Zuckerberg responded by comparing Facebook\u2019s advertiser-supported service which doesn\u2019t charge users to the Apple business model of charging consumers premium prices for hardware:  You know, I find that argument, that if you\u2019re not paying that somehow we can\u2019t care about you, to be extremely glib and not at all aligned with the truth. The reality here is that if you want to build a service that helps connect everyone in the world, then there are a lot of people who can\u2019t afford to pay. And therefore, as with a lot of media, having an advertising-supported model is the only rational model that can support building this service to reach people.  ...if you want to build a service which is not just serving rich people, then you need to have something that people can afford.  It seems that Mr. Zuckerberg will continue to offer an affordable service--assuming consumers don\u2019t regard sharing their personal information as too high a price to pay for social media. Speaking of costs and benefits, Mr. Zuckerberg makes clear in his Vox interview that Facebook is becoming a more aggressive media gatekeeper:  In 2016, we were behind having an understanding and operational excellence on preventing things like misinformation, Russian interference. And you can bet that\u2019s a huge focus for us going forward...  After the 2016 US elections, a number of months later, there were the French elections. And for that, we spent a bunch of time developing new AI tools to find the kind of fake accounts spreading misinformation and we took down \u2014 I think it was more than 30,000 accounts, and I think the reports out of France were that people felt like that was a much cleaner election on social media.  A few months later, there were the German elections. And there, we augmented the playbook again to work directly with the election commission in Germany. If you work with the government in a country, they\u2019ll really actually have a fuller understanding of what is going on and what are all the issues that we would need to focus on.  The idea of Facebook working with governments around the world to filter news is more frightening than almost any commercial use of user data one can imagine.  In a recent letter to the editor of this newspaper, Rodger Cornell of Kinsale, Va. no doubt speaks for many readers in addressing new proposals to filter Internet content on services like Facebook:  During most of my adult life the news that I received was indeed filtered, in most instances by liberal newspaper editors. I\u2019ll take my chances on a wide-open internet, thank you.  ***  Bottom Stories of the Day will return on Wednesday.  ***  Follow James Freeman on Twitter.

Now the mobs are howling after Facebook , Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s creature.  It is true that Facebook\u2019s release of personal \u201cfriend data\u201d into the ozone through Cambridge Analytica remains in the news only because of the prevailing superstition that the Facebook monster allowed Donald Trump to be elected president. The idea that omnipotent technology manipulated the 2016 election has greater appeal to advanced progressive thinking than Hillary Clinton\u2019s explanation that married white women sold her out.  But really, all that is a sideshow. The backlash against this technology, the belief that the creature must be controlled, has been building for several years. Along with Google, Facebook is the biggest web target, so Mark Zuckerberg is about to get torched by Congress and any regulator within reach for abusing \u201cdata.\u201d  Data is the oxygen of the internet. Any online click for any reason inputs data. In the beginning this data, organized into things like family Facebook groups or Google Maps or Wikipedia, was seen as good.  For several years BTTP\u2014BTTP being human history Before The Trump Presidency \u2014articles and books poured forth describing the dark side of this technology. In the past year, that criticism has reached critical mass.  Researchers and parents agree that social media is distorting the lives of young people, especially adolescent girls. No one knows what to do about it.  Web forums fill with millions of young men exchanging sexual and political rants. No one knows what to do about it.  Terrorists wallow in jihadist videos on YouTube, brainwashing themselves into acts of mass murder. No one knows what to do about it.  People write articles saying they have forgotten how to read books.  Major advertisers accuse social-media companies of allowing their ads to appear alongside pornography, a bog beyond anyone\u2019s control.  The cyberwarfare spies of Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency ran around the U.S. uncaught for years.  Social media\u2019s contribution to the Arab Spring and Ukraine\u2019s Orange Revolution was an era ago. The technology has been captured since by dictators who use it as an instrument of surveillance and control that would startle Philip K. Dick.  In one week, Facebook the good communitarian has become Facebook the abuser of everyone\u2019s privacy.  The story of Frankenstein endures as a metaphor of good intentions gone haywire because it keeps happening. Some people used to argue that because Albert Einstein explained how energy could be released from atoms, he bore responsibility for the atomic bomb. By this logic blame should fall on Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, for electing Donald Trump.  Do not for a moment think that Mr. Zuckerberg, Mr. Berners-Lee or any of the others who created modern life online are unaware that history may conclude their creations were a mistake.  Mr. Berners-Lee, reacting to the Facebook mess, accused social-media companies of abusing his creation: \u201cThe fact that power is concentrated among so few companies has made it possible to weaponize the web at scale.\u201d  \u201cWeaponize\u201d evokes the idea of dual-use technology, which is tech that can be put to both a peaceful and military purpose, such as rocket guidance systems. The internet has finally been recognized as a dual-use technology, good and bad.  Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s CEO and inheritor of Steve Jobs\u2019s creations, weighed in this week, ironically from China, the global leader in Orwellian surveillance systems. \u201cThe ability of anyone to know what you\u2019ve been browsing about for years,\u201d said Mr. Cook, \u201cwho your contacts are, who their contacts are, things you like and dislike and every intimate detail of your life\u2014from my own point of view it shouldn\u2019t exist.\u201d Of course, the iPhone became the universal gateway into this dystopia.  One can imagine that when Sergey Brin and Larry Page created Google\u2019s early motto, \u201cDon\u2019t Be Evil,\u201d they sensed what Robert Oppenheimer and his colleagues on the Manhattan Project knew: The power of what they had created might be a problem.  Back when superstition ruled the world, the solution to a larger-than-life problem was known as forcing the genie back into the bottle. Today, when algorithms rule the world, one would think that an industry with aggregate IQ greater than any ever assembled could figure this out. But maybe IQ correlates with the problem.  If the issue is privacy, why does every app and site incentivize users to scroll past pages of legal boilerplate to hit \u201cI Agree,\u201d rather than writing up top in large type: \u201cTHIS IS THE ONE SENTENCE YOU\u2019VE GOTTA THINK ABOUT BEFORE YOU AGREE\u201d?  There is another alternative to trying to dam up the internet torrent with regulation: Every time anyone clicks into an app or search engine, they should see this more needed personal motto for our times: Don\u2019t Be Stupid.

I was in New York with the fall term\u2019s last classes to teach, so I compartmentalized. I didn\u2019t learn he had died until I arrived home at 10:30.  Stunned, I checked to see whether my family had announced our loss. Hours earlier, an acquaintance had posted on my Facebook page: \u201cSorry about your dad.\u201d Others sent condolences privately, but still before I had heard the news. Turned out, everyone had read my 20-year-old nephew Sam\u2019s poignant tribute at 7 p.m.: \u201cThank you for all you have given, Grandpa.\u201d  The speedy digital death messages that night felt devastating. I appreciated everyone\u2019s desire to connect, but there are more-sensitive ways to sympathize online:  Photo: istock/Getty Images  \u2022 Slow down. If you hear of a death secondhand, don\u2019t race to call, text or post. Check if an obituary has been published, if someone has personally shared the news, or if the funeral home has announced a service. Otherwise you could be the messenger. Paper cards may be more thoughtful anyway.  \u2022 Don\u2019t waste money. With broke friends, I\u2019ve sent a check or donated directly to cover burial costs. That wasn\u2019t our case. Flowers and food baskets are generous, but my family preferred all donations to go to the needy. My parents grew up poor, dad a street kid on New York\u2019s Lower East Side. His pride was putting his four kids through college and arranging educational trusts for his grandkids. I finally posted a few of his charities on Facebook: the medical school where he taught and a Hasidic nonprofit that helps kids with special needs. Since my conservative father and I argued politics (he characterized my candidate, Hillary, and her husband as \u201cBonnie and Clyde,\u201d while I called his \u201cDrumpf\u201d), I added the Israel Defense Forces, our shared passion, as a concession. When notices of donations came in, I cherished them as if dad were still doing good in the world.  \u2022 No advice. After we chose Sunday for the funeral, I completed my classes and attended a long-scheduled academic panel. Dad, a fellow workaholic, loved my teaching (\u201cfinally a real job!\u201d). Several people suggested I cancel, bury him sooner, or have a separate Manhattan shiva. Unless you\u2019re asked, hold your opinion.  \u2022 Forget yourself and your loss. Well-wishers updated me on their dads\u2019 ages and sicknesses, as if competing in the Grief Olympics. One said she couldn\u2019t attend the service because of her father\u2019s recovery. A co-worker compared it to losing her cat. Try \u201cSorry to hear\u201d or \u201cSending love.\u201d  \u2022 Respond to what\u2019s shared. Cyberspace helped me mourn. The chapel taped and offered a link to dad\u2019s memorial, which I posted. I loved when out-of-towners commented on my eulogy, adding their own recollections. Our old neighbor, David, recalled Dad rushing over when he fell sick at 3 a.m. That made me feel closer to my father, Jack Shapiro, a Leo born under a lucky star. Tagging him reminded me that my staid 85-year-old dad was on Facebook, where he\u2019ll live forever, my political foe and eternal friend.  Ms. Shapiro, a New School professor, is a co-author of \u201cThe Bosnia List\u201d (Penguin, 2014) and author of \u201cLighting Up\u201d (Delacorte, 2004).", "stock": "FB", "label": 1, "date": "2018-01-23", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-to-grieve-in-the-facebook-age-1516666092"}, {"article": "Facebook Inc.\u2019s FB 0.40% campaign to re-enter China has hit another setback with the departure of a veteran executive who had been leading efforts to improve relations with Chinese government leaders.

Ms. Moser couldn\u2019t be reached for comment. Her exit was first reported by the New York Times.  Analysts say the loss of Ms. Moser only adds to Facebook\u2019s challenges in re-entering China, where it has been blocked since 2009, reflecting the government\u2019s concern over the ability of large social networks to stir unrest.

Photo: Ng Han Guan/Associated Press  Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has made China a priority. Last week, in a move widely seen as a possible back door into China for the Silicon Valley company, Facebook joined with Beijing-based smartphone company Xiaomi Corp. to launch a new virtual-reality headset called Mi VR Standalone, modeled after Facebook\u2019s Oculus Go.  Ms. Moser, a U.S. citizen born in China, was hired to help build face-to-face relations with government officials. Before joining Facebook, Ms. Moser spent more than a decade at Intel Corp. in China, where former colleagues said she helped Intel build a $2.5 billion factory.  In a 2011 essay, she called arranging meetings with Chinese officials a \u201clong, trivial and pressing\u201d task. She had some successes at Facebook, joining Mr. Zuckerberg for a meeting with Lu Wei, then China\u2019s top internet regulator, at Facebook headquarters in late 2014.  She also accompanied Mr. Zuckerberg in March 2016 to Beijing meetings with Mr. Lu and the Communist Party\u2019s ideology chief Liu Yunshan.  William Shuai, a former government official who Ms. Moser hired away from LinkedIn Corp.\u2019s China operations in September, has assumed her duties for now, according to one person familiar with the situation. LinkedIn is the only major U.S. social network to have a foothold in China, after it agreed to submit to government censorship to gain access to the market.

Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images  Members of Congress took turns lashing Mark Zuckerberg this week for Facebook \u2019s myriad screw-ups. The CEO showed contrition, but his apologia has raised important questions about the government\u2019s failures.  Democrats who were once enthralled with Silicon Valley fell out of love with Facebook following reports that Russian trolls used its platform to promulgate fake news and ads to support Donald Trump in 2016. Then came news that a political firm linked to the Trump campaign may have misappropriated data on 270,000 users and their 87 million friends collected by a third-party app.  Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s defense? Facebook was too \u201ctrusting.\u201d After the Guardian newspaper reported in 2015 that a Cambridge University researcher had shared data from his personality-quiz app with the political firm Cambridge Analytica , Facebook asked Cambridge Analytica to delete the data. Cambridge Analytica said it had, and Facebook accepted its word.  The incident demonstrated that Facebook\u2019s privacy protections were flimsier than it claimed. In 2011 Facebook settled charges with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) over mishandling user data, and Facebook agreed to establish stronger privacy protections and obtain periodic third-party audits. But Facebook has now disclosed that tens of thousands of apps may have obtained data on users and their friends beyond what they needed to operate.  This seems to violate the FTC\u2019s consent decree, as Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal noted. Mr. Zuckerberg waffled in reply that \u201cit certainly appears that we should have been aware that [the researcher] submitted a term that was in conflict with the rules of the platform.\u201d But he said the third-party audits didn\u2019t turn up problems.  The FTC is now investigating Facebook\u2019s privacy controls, but a few questions: Why didn\u2019t the commission ensure years ago that Facebook had established policies to prevent third-party apps from repurposing data? Was the agency too trusting? The Obama campaign app in 2012 exploited data from users and their friends. This may also have violated the FTC consent decree, especially if it shared the data with other liberal groups. Did political considerations influence the FTC\u2019s lax oversight?  These are important questions since Democrats are pressing for more stringent privacy regulations, which Mr. Zuckerberg said he\u2019s open to. But regulation typically benefits incumbents like Facebook that can afford to spend more on compliance while tripping up small competitors. Before establishing new regulations, the FTC should ensure that tech companies abide by their own policies.  Mr. Zuckerberg was also keelhauled for letting Russians exploit the platform in 2016. Facebook has since identified 470 pages and accounts linked to the Russian-controlled Internet Research Agency, which generated at least 200,000 pieces of content over two years. The Russian outfit also bought 3,000 ads on Facebook and Instagram.  The spread of fake news was partly due to Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s refusal to exercise editorial control over content or pay for quality news. Employing people to sift out junk is expensive, though the increased regulation that may come if he doesn\u2019t also isn\u2019t cheap.  But Facebook can\u2019t be held entirely responsible for Russia\u2019s interference. Only the Justice Department can see across media channels and has the power to investigate election fraud, as special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s indictment of 13 Russians in February showed.  The Russians began organizing in 2013 and stole American identities. \u201cBeginning in or around June 2014, and continuing into June 2015, public reporting began to identify operations conducted by the [IRA] in the United States,\u201d the indictment says. The Russian operatives also created fake accounts on Twitter and YouTube. Yet the Obama Administration waited until December 2016 to slap sanctions on Russians for hacking Democratic National Committee emails. It doesn\u2019t appear that social- media interference was ever a priority.  While Facebook has endorsed legislation that would require more disclosure for buyers of political ads, the regulatory burden could make it harder for small companies and blogs to sell ads. This could drive more political advertising to Facebook. And it\u2019s unclear how the legislation would prevent identity fraud.  Democrats are bitter that President Trump won the election and are using Facebook as a scapegoat. Facebook is hardly blameless, but neither is the Obama Administration.", "stock": "FB", "label": -1, "date": "2018-04-11", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/democrats-unfriend-facebook-1523487381"}, {"article": "Facebook Inc., FB 0.40% facing a firestorm over how it handles personal information, says it will make it simpler for users to examine and change some of the data about them that the social network tracks.  The tweaks, announced Wednesday and set to roll out in the coming weeks, include a new, central hub in the Facebook app settings that contains existing tools for users to review and, if desired, delete traces of their Facebook activity such as past posts and search terms. Some other data, such as which ads users clicked on, still won\u2019t be erasable. Facebook says any information users delete is wiped from its servers.  Facebook will also redesign its settings menu for mobile devices, now spread out across almost 20 different screens, and consolidate \u200bits privacy and security options in a single place.  The moves are part of broader changes Facebook is planning to bolster privacy, said Rob Sherman, Facebook\u2019s deputy privacy officer. They come amid intensifying scrutiny from users, regulators and lawmakers over Facebook\u2019s admission on March 16 that user data was improperly obtained by Cambridge Analytica, a data-analytics firm that worked for the 2016 Trump campaign.  The backlash has shaken Facebook and hammered its stock, cleaving more than $95 billion off its market value in just over a week. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg apologized last week for a \u201cmajor breach of trust\u201d in the Cambridge Analytica episode and is expected to testify before U.S. lawmakers on data-use practices next month.  \u201cIt\u2019s been a very intense week,\u201d Mr. Sherman said in an interview. \u201cOne thing that\u2019s been really clear is that we\u2019ve lost people\u2019s trust and need to do a lot of work right away to work on regaining it.\u201d  The Cambridge Analytica revelation showed limits to Facebook\u2019s enforcement of rules governing outsiders\u2019 handling of user data and its ability to see how third parties may have used Facebook data. Facebook says the firm obtained the data, involving potentially tens of millions of users, in violation of its rules from an app developer that was allowed to have the information but not to sell it. It is investigating whether Cambridge Analytica kept the data after Facebook demanded it be deleted in 2015. Cambridge Analytica has said it followed Facebook\u2019s policies.  The episode has prompted renewed attention to how much information about its users Facebook tracks, and accelerated government scrutiny of the social network, which is already under the microscope for its role in allowing Russian-backed groups to use its tools to sway U.S. political discourse before and after the 2016 presidential race.  In a March 21 post, Mr. Zuckerberg said Facebook would investigate and audit app creators who may have abused personal data about Facebook users as well as restrict the amount of information available to developers. At the same time, he said, Facebook is limited in its ability to uncover instances of data misuse because the information is impossible to track once it is downloaded off Facebook servers.  Mr. Sherman also said Facebook faces challenges in determining how data provided to app creators in the past may have been misused over time. But he said the effort is vital. \u201cPeople will only feel comfortable using Facebook if they have confidence that their information will be protected,\u201d he said.  Facebook's current data crisis involving Cambridge Analytica has angered users and prompted government investigations. To understand what's happening now, you have to look back at Facebook's old policies from 2007 to 2014. WSJ's Shelby Holliday explains.

Photo: Paul Sakuma/Associated Press  Facebook Inc. FB 0.40% is contending with a new wave of criticism prompted by the U.S. indictment alleging that Russia manipulated social-media platforms\u2014and by a Facebook executive\u2019s attempts to address the issue.  The indictment against Russian companies and individuals described how an organization called the Internet Research Agency allegedly used Facebook, Twitter Inc., TWTR -0.83% and the YouTube arm of Alphabet Inc.\u2019s GOOGL -0.12% Google to sow discord in the U.S. starting in 2014. The document\u2019s description of events showed that Facebook and its Instagram photo-sharing unit were particularly central to the alleged Russian attempts to influence U.S. public opinion.  Researchers who study social media said the indictment, secured by special counsel Robert Mueller, showed that Facebook was ill-prepared for such efforts. Facebook has more than 25,000 employees, but fewer than 100 Russian provocateurs armed with social-media savvy and widely available technological tools were able to manipulate its platform for years, the indictment says.  Comments by Facebook\u2019s head of advertising, Rob Goldman, after the indictment was handed up Friday fueled further criticism. Mr. Goldman, writing on Twitter, said there are \u201ceasy ways to fight\u201d the Russian campaign, starting with having a \u201cwell educated citizenry.\u201d He also tweeted that the Russians\u2019 main goal wasn\u2019t to sway the 2016 election, but more broadly to sow division in the U.S.  Mr. Goldman\u2019s series of eight tweets provoked more than 9,000 responses on Twitter, many of them angry.  \u201cYou really are not in a position to preach and your astonishing tweets have created confusion and anger,\u201d Mainardo de Nardis, a senior executive at advertising giant Omnicom Group Inc., said in a tweet Sunday. \u201cEnough damage done over the past 2+ years. In the absence of real actions silence would be appreciated.\u201d Mr. de Nardis didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.  A Facebook spokesman said Mr. Goldman, who didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment, had sent his tweets in a personal capacity. The company pointed to a statement from Joel Kaplan, Facebook\u2019s vice president of global public policy, saying, \u201cNothing we found contradicts the Special Counsel\u2019s indictments.\u201d  Russia\u2019s government has repeatedly denied any government effort to influence the U.S. election.  Facebook has struggled for much of the past year to respond to mounting ire from users, politicians, customers and others over its role in facilitating the spread of misinformation and divisive content.  The indictment shows that \u201cthere are lots of levers that get pulled in social media for the sake of manipulation and a lot of those levers aren\u2019t even known by the companies themselves,\u201d said Sam Woolley, an Oxford University research associate who has studied propaganda efforts on social-media platforms.  The indictment documented an unprecedented manipulation campaign targeting Facebook, its Instagram platform, Twitter and YouTube. Starting in 2014, the Russians built an influence operation that drew followers to bogus accounts that spread disinformation, organized U.S. demonstrations and even paid a person to dress up like Hillary Clinton in a prison uniform at a West Palm Beach, Fla., rally, the indictment says.  While much of the attention around the Russian manipulation focused on its efforts to stoke divisions ahead the 2016 U.S. presidential election, it is clear the campaign continued since then. The Wall Street Journal reported in October that some of the Russian-backed social-media accounts posted divisive messages at least as recently as last August.  The Twitter comments of Mr. Goldman, Facebook\u2019s head of advertising, also fueled disagreement about the intent of the Russian efforts. One of Mr. Goldman\u2019s tweets said \u201cswaying the election was *NOT* the main goal\u201d of the Russian ads, and that \u201cthe majority of the Russian ad spend happened AFTER the election.\u201d  On Saturday, President Donald Trump cited Mr. Goldman\u2019s comment in support of the idea that Russia\u2019s actions didn\u2019t affect the election.  Following criticism that he was obscuring the intent of the Russians, Mr. Goldman later tweeted that \u201cthe Russian campaign was certainly in favor of Mr. Trump.\u201d He also dialed back some of his claims. \u201cI am only speaking here about the Russian behavior on Facebook. That is the only aspect that I observed directly,\u201d he tweeted.  Clint Watts, a fellow with the Foreign Policy Research Institute who studied the Russian influence campaign, said the ads bought on Facebook were only \u201ca much smaller part of a very large effort.\u201d  \u201cMr. Goldman should have stayed silent,\u201d Mr. Watts said, adding that playing down the effect of the influence campaign risked further angering Americans. \u201cThe public is upset that they got duped on Facebook\u2019s platform. Facebook got duped,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes it seem like they don\u2019t get it.\u201d  While Facebook\u2019s role in the Russian campaign is in the spotlight, some researchers who have studied the efforts note that it was far from the only institution to fall short.  \u201cLet\u2019s not mince words. The Obama administration did not react quickly enough to this problem. The intelligence community did not react quickly enough to this problem,\u201d said Thomas Rid, professor of strategic studies at Johns Hopkins University.  Facebook has said it is taking a number of steps to prevent efforts like the Russian campaign from happening again, including hiring 10,000 employees tasked with policing hate speech, as well as coming up with ways to uproot fake accounts. Facebook officials also have emphasized that the company provided information to Mr. Mueller.  Based on the information that's now coming out of congressional committees, Russian goals to interfere in the 2016 election were very broad. WSJ's Gerald F. Seib explains just how sophisticated the Russian efforts were using social media.

Still, his comments struck some observers as tone deaf.  \u201cIt was an almost perfect example of Silicon Valley overconfidence and lack of sophistication when it comes to politics,\u201d said Josh Hendler, former director of technology for the Democratic National Committee, which suffered a cyberattack ahead of the 2016 election that U.S. officials blamed on Russia.

Instagram, left, and Facebook, right, used to feel like two distinct digital experiences, but they feel increasingly similar as Instagram adopts Facebook-style recommendations and notifications. Shown, the apps on iPhone X screens. Photo: Emily Prapuolenis/The Wall Street Journal  I use Facebook , FB 0.40% like most people, but I often say my real self is on Instagram.  On Facebook, I share major life changes and links to articles I\u2019ve written. But that long, emotional post from the refugee camp in Greece where I volunteered? Or the picture where I\u2019m dressed up as the late Chicago Cubs announcer Harry Caray for Halloween? Instagram all the way.  Facebook Inc. has owned Instagram since 2012 but until recently the social network and the photo-sharing app have felt like distinct experiences. For years, Instagram was a haven from Facebook\u2019s annoying ads, creepy friend suggestions and viral clickbait. Meanwhile, Facebook has begun to draw fire as a potential menace to mental health and stable democracies alike.  So it\u2019s a little surprising that recent Instagram updates make it feel much more like its big brother. Sure, when Instagram has taken a page from Facebook\u2019s playbook in the past, it has paid off: Switching from a chronological feed to an algorithm increased engagement.  And Instagram\u2019s user base continues to grow. Monthly active users doubled to 800 million from February to September last year; the app had 500 million daily active users as of September.  But lately even Instagram\u2019s owner has acknowledged the distinction between a habitual user and a happy user. The latest updates may get people into Instagram more frequently, or for a longer time, but there\u2019s little to enjoy about them. Here\u2019s why I\u2019m falling out of love with one of my favorite apps.  Recommended Garbage  Part of what made Instagram great was that your main feed was a stream of things you wanted to see: pictures and videos from friends and accounts whose posts you enjoy. The Facebook-type noise\u2014stuff your friends had commented on, public chatter\u2014remained in other tabs you could click over to if you felt like it.  A few weeks ago, I was scrolling through Instagram, minding my own business, when a random picture of a man showed up, posted by an account I\u2019d never heard of. For a split second, I thought I was in someone else\u2019s account.  Photo: The Wall Street Journal  Starting in December, Instagram has been putting posts from people you don\u2019t follow right into your feed, under a \u201cRecommended for you\u201d banner.  They are sandwiched between your feed\u2019s new posts and previously viewed ones. If you tap the three dots on the right side of the banner, you can hide these posts temporarily, but you can\u2019t opt out of them entirely.  An Instagram spokeswoman said the feature \u201cmakes it easier to find relevant, high-quality content and accounts you wouldn\u2019t normally see but might enjoy.\u201d  Research has shown that when we see Facebook content from people we don\u2019t know, it can enhance the feeling that others are living better lives. One study found that when people used Facebook passively\u2014scrolling but not commenting, liking or posting\u2014their feelings of envy increased.  Even Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has weighed in: He recently told investors he wants the company \u201cto encourage meaningful social interactions.\u201d Instagram\u2019s recommended posts are the opposite of meaningful.  Post, Post, Ad  I can now make it through three new posts on Instagram before seeing an ad. After that, I get one every six to eight posts.  Instagram\u2019s spokeswoman confirmed ad load is up: \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to do this by improving the quality and the relevance of the ads.\u201d  But the ad load feels way up. According to the social advertising firm Brand Networks, clients delivered 17 times as many ad impressions on Instagram in 2017 as in 2016. The company, which works with brands including American Express Co. and Unilever PLC, expects Instagram impressions to grow by 25% in the first quarter of 2018, compared with the previous quarter.  Instagram may be free, but you\u2019re paying for it with your constantly interrupted attention.  Nowhere to Hide  Earlier this month, Instagram\u2019s direct messages started showing when users were last active.  Photo: The Wall Street Journal  While a lot of people are fine with such a feature\u2014closely related to the instant-message read receipt\u2014others feel it is intrusive. You can disable the feature in settings, but it\u2019s on by default.  The Instagram spokeswoman says the feature allows for \u201cmore of a real-time experience.\u201d  People reeled when Facebook made them download a separate Messenger app, which has since become larded up with too many such real-time features. That may be a harbinger of things to come for Instagram, which is testing a stand-alone camera-first messaging app in six countries outside the U.S.  People You Don\u2019t Want to Know  Facebook\u2019s \u201cPeople you may know\u201d feature, which suggests who you might want to friend, is known for being creepy. Facebook says suggestions are drawn from mutual friends, your networks and contacts you\u2019ve uploaded, among other criteria.  Instagram shares information with Facebook, and it turns out its follow suggestions are just as creepy.  How creepy? I created a fresh Instagram account with my work email and didn\u2019t sync it to Facebook. Still, 78 out of 100 recommendations were my Facebook friends.  The other 22 names were even more interesting. They looked like strangers. But you can get linked to people\u2014even borderline strangers\u2014who saved your email or phone number and synced their contacts to Facebook, which they\u2019ve linked to their Instagram. One of my suggested friends was an apartment broker I\u2019d emailed through Craigslist... in 2009. (Gizmodo actually built a People You May Know Inspector so you can study Facebook\u2019s seemingly mysterious links.)  Even when you don\u2019t upload your contacts directly to Instagram, the network uses information\u2014or \u201csignals,\u201d as Instagram calls them\u2014from Facebook, which might include contacts or other tangential information.  No Mo\u2019 Notifications  Now is not a bad time to go through your notification settings. Did you know that Instagram has 17 categories? Among them are notifications about which Facebook friends use Instagram. If you don\u2019t want to be bugged constantly about adding them, you can turn this off. Just remember: This won\u2019t stop Instagram from telling your Facebook friends that you\u2019re on the app.  You might want to shut off other notifications too, such as the one that says someone is posting for the first time in a while, or my personal favorite, the one that reminds you that you have unseen notifications.  On top of that, Facebook, Instagram and Messenger have been testing a cross-platform notification feature, which lets users see all alerts and hop between the apps.  I understand why Instagram is adopting Facebook features: They work. But for years I logged into Instagram and enjoyed it more than Facebook. I fear a day when I wake up, open my phone and can no longer tell the difference between the two.

The deportation appears to bring an abrupt end to a months-long cat-and-mouse game between Saakashvili and the Ukrainian authorities, which saw street unrest during previous attempts to arrest him. Some critics, including in the opposition, said his movement distracted from the broader opposition\u2019s campaign to hold the Kiev leadership to account.  \u201cThis person was on Ukrainian territory illegally and therefore, in compliance with all legal procedures, he was returned to the country from where he arrived,\u201d border service spokesman Oleh Slobodyan said in a post on Facebook.

He held a regional governorship from 2015-2016 before falling out with Poroshenko and joining the opposition.  Poroshenko stripped Saakashvili of his Ukrainian citizenship last year, but Saakashvili re-entered Ukraine anyway from Poland in September, promising to confront the president, whom he accuses of corruption, which Poroshenko denies.

I love Facebook and don't want to delete it. When I signed up, I made a deal with Facebook and I was OK with it: I get to use it for free and in exchange I willingly share some info about me to let Facebook serve me relevant ads. Sure, Facebook, go ahead and send me all the ads you want about things I want to buy: bicycles, skiing, fitness, fashion, travel, pets, movies, books and so on. It sounded great.  But as Facebook's data privacy scandal has embroiled the company, I've grown increasing disgusted.  Back in 2014, Facebook began watching people as we wander across the internet. At that time, it instituted privacy controls that seemed to put me in control, to tell Facebook which people can see my posts, friends or the public.  But that's only half of the story.  Zuckerberg also repeatedly told Congress that Facebook doesn't share my info directly with advertisers, nor does it sell my data. It uses data on me to decide which ads to show to which people.  But it's harder to tell Facebook which data on me to use for its ads. And Facebook is still tracking more information about me for this purpose than I want. For instance, the Facebook Audience Network is used by mobile apps serves ads in a mobile apps and analyzes what people do with a mobile app.  Ad blocker AdGuard recently analyzed 2,556 popular apps and found 41% of them use Facebook Audience Network. That means, even if you don't use Facebook, these apps could be sharing data about you with Facebook.  By the way, Google does this on an even bigger scale. 65% of the apps that AdGuard analyzes used one of Google's tracking services.  On top of that, if I visit a website that is using the Facebook Pixel, Facebook knows I've been to that website and can show me an ad for the company in my newsfeed. That's creepy and annoying. Pixel is a popular tool used by website owners to track and analyze what you do on their websites.  Now, Zuckerberg insisted many times in his congressional testimony that I can control the ads I see.  It's not easy to do that, but through its Ad Preferences page, I can opt out of seeing ads based on how Facebook is monitoring my internet use by clicking on \"no\" \"no\" and \"no one\" in the settings.  Facebook/Business Insider  I also adjusted what Facebook thinks it knows about me. This requires sifting through the list of stuff it tracks on me, one by one, and deleting.  I started with the \"Your categories\" setting.  Facebook/Business Insider  Next up, I went through the \"Your interests\" settings: what Facebook thinks it knows about me in terms of business, hobbies, sports, travel, etc.. I had to delete them one-by-one, including the ones listed in \"more.\"  Facebook/Business Insider  I started to do the same for the section marked \"Advertisers you've interacted with.\" But after 15 minutes, with no way to know how close I was to the end, I gave up for now. I will come back to it and delete more each day.  This was perhaps the most shocking section, as it involves lists shared with Facebook where my name appears, even though I have no idea who some of these companies are, or how they wound up identified with my Facebook profile. It was also filled with politicians (like Doug Robinson, below), most of whom I didn't know.  Facebook/Business Insider  But because Facebook is ad-supported, it warns that I will still see ads.  Again, I'm A-OK with that, especially ads on topics of interest to me. But I don't get to choose. The advertiser, who is paying the bill, gets to choose.  Facebook says that, even if I limit my interests, it will still show me ads based on the following:  \"Your age, gender or location.  The content in the app or website you're using.  Your activity off of the Facebook Companies.\"  That last bit, \"Facebook Companies\" is particularly worrisome.  In addition to the Facebook Pixel and Facebook Audience Network, Facebook owns a company, Atlas that puts a bit of code on your browser to watch what you do on the internet. Facebook also owns \"Moves,\" a fitness tracking app that monitors your location, if you use that app. And it owns Onovo, a security app that was the subject of another privacy scandal for its policy of sharing data with Facebook.  In other words, while you can control the ads you see, you can't really control the information that Facebook gathers on you.  So, if the nation wants more control over how our lives are being watched, we'll need to push, and probably regulate, Facebook and the whole internet ad industry.  In the meantime, for people like me, that don't want to quit Facebook, we can limit the ads Facebook shows us through its internet spying practices, limiting the financial reward it gets for such creepy behavior.

He added that data was kept around to eventually help brands serve targeted ads.  Beth Gautier, a Facebook spokeswoman, put it this way: \u201cWhen you delete something, we remove it so it\u2019s not visible or accessible on Facebook.\u201d She added: \u201cYou can also delete your account whenever you want. It may take up to 90 days to delete all backups of data on our servers.\u201d  Digging through your Facebook files is an exercise I highly recommend if you care about how your personal information is stored and used. Here\u2019s what I learned.  Facebook Retains More Data Than We Think  When you download a copy of your Facebook data, you will see a folder containing multiple subfolders and files. The most important one is the \u201cindex\u201d file, which is essentially a raw data set of your Facebook account, where you can click through your profile, friends list, timeline and messages, among other features.  One surprising part of my index file was a section called Contact Info. This contained the 764 names and phone numbers of everyone in my iPhone\u2019s address book. Upon closer inspection, it turned out that Facebook had stored my entire phone book because I had uploaded it when setting up Facebook\u2019s messaging app, Messenger.  This was unsettling. I had hoped Messenger would use my contacts list to find others who were also using the app so that I could connect with them easily \u2014 and hold on to the relevant contact information only for the people who were on Messenger. Yet Facebook kept the entire list, including the phone numbers for my car mechanic, my apartment door buzzer and a pizzeria.  This felt unnecessary, though Facebook holds on to your phone book partly to keep it synchronized with your contacts list on Messenger and to help find people who newly sign up for the messaging service. I opted to turn off synchronizing and deleted all my phone book entries.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  My Facebook data also revealed how little the social network forgets. For instance, in addition to recording the exact date I signed up for Facebook in 2004, there was a record of when I deactivated Facebook in October 2010, only to reactivate it four days later \u2014 something I barely remember doing.  Facebook also kept a history of each time I opened Facebook over the last two years, including which device and web browser I used. On some days, it even logged my locations, like when I was at a hospital two years ago or when I visited Tokyo last year.  Facebook keeps a log of this data as a security measure to flag suspicious logins from unknown devices or locations, similar to how banks send a fraud alert when your credit card number is used in a suspicious location. This practice seemed reasonable, so I didn\u2019t try to purge this information.  But what bothered me was the data that I had explicitly deleted but that lingered in plain sight. On my friends list, Facebook had a record of \u201cRemoved Friends,\u201d a dossier of the 112 people I had removed along with the date I clicked the \u201cUnfriend\u201d button. Why should Facebook remember the people I\u2019ve cut off from my life?  Facebook\u2019s explanation was dissatisfying. The company said it might use my list of deleted friends so that those people did not appear in my feed with the feature \u201cOn This Day,\u201d which resurfaces memories from years past to help people reminisce. I\u2019d rather have the option to delete the list of deleted friends for good.  Photo  The Ad Industry Has Eyes Everywhere  What Facebook retained about me isn\u2019t remotely as creepy as the sheer number of advertisers that have my information in their databases. I found this out when I clicked on the Ads section in my Facebook file, which loaded a history of the dozen ads I had clicked on while browsing the social network.  Lower down, there was a section titled \u201cAdvertisers with your contact info,\u201d followed by a list of roughly 500 brands, the overwhelming majority of which I had never interacted with. Some brands sounded obscure and sketchy \u2014 one was called \u201cMicrophone Check,\u201d which turned out to be a radio show. Other brands were more familiar, like Victoria\u2019s Secret Pink, Good Eggs or AARP.  Facebook said unfamiliar advertisers might appear on the list because they might have obtained my contact information from elsewhere, compiled it into a list of people they wanted to target and uploaded that list into Facebook. Brands can upload their customer lists into a tool called Custom Audiences, which helps them find those same people\u2019s Facebook profiles to serve them ads.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Brands can obtain your information in many different ways. Those include:  \u25a0 Buying information from a data provider like Acxiom, which has amassed one of the world\u2019s largest commercial databases on consumers. Brands can buy different types of customer data sets from a provider, like contact information for people who belong to a certain demographic, and take that information to Facebook to serve targeted ads, said Michael Priem, chief executive of Modern Impact, an advertising firm in Minneapolis.  Last month, Facebook announced that it was limiting its practice of allowing advertisers to target ads using information from third-party data brokers like Acxiom.  \u25a0 Using tracking technologies like web cookies and invisible pixels that load in your web browser to collect information about your browsing activities. There are many different trackers on the web, and Facebook offers 10 different trackers to help brands harvest your information, according to Ghostery, which offers privacy tools that block ads and trackers. The advertisers can take some pieces of data that they have collected with trackers and upload them into the Custom Audiences tool to serve ads to you on Facebook.  \u25a0 Getting your information in simpler ways, too. Someone you shared information with could share it with another entity. Your credit card loyalty program, for example, could share your information with a hotel chain, and that hotel chain could serve you ads on Facebook.  The upshot? Even a Facebook lurker, like myself, who has barely clicked on any digital ads can have personal information exposed to an enormous number of advertisers. This was not entirely surprising, but seeing the list of unfamiliar brands with my contact information in my Facebook file was a dose of reality.  I tried to contact some of these advertisers, like Very Important Puppets, a toymaker, to ask them about what they did with my data. They did not respond.

Knowing this, I also downloaded copies of my Google data with a tool called Google Takeout. The data sets were exponentially larger than my Facebook data. For my personal email account alone, Google\u2019s archive of my data measured eight gigabytes, enough to hold about 2,000 hours of music. By comparison, my Facebook data was about 650 megabytes, the equivalent of about 160 hours of music.

I didn\u2019t click on ads for either of these stories, but the search giant logged them because the sites had loaded ads served by Google.  In another folder, labeled Android, Google had a record of apps I had opened on an Android phone since 2015, along with the date and time. This felt like an extraordinary level of detail.  Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  On a brighter note, I downloaded an archive of my LinkedIn data. The data set was less than half a megabyte and contained exactly what I had expected: spreadsheets of my LinkedIn contacts and information I had added to my profile.  Yet that offered little solace.

The unexpected compensation arrangement - announced in the middle of the night in California - involves no salary or cash bonus but sets up rewards for Musk multiplying Tesla\u2019s market value as much as ten-fold to $650 billion over the next 10 years.  That ambitious target implies Tesla stock will grow by 1,000 percent over a decade, or about 27 percent per year, a feat achieved by only a handful of major U.S. companies recently, including Amazon.com Inc, Priceline Group Inc and Domino\u2019s Pizza Inc. Netflix has surged 6,600 percent in the past 10 years.  Tesla\u2019s current market value of $60 billion is about the same as General Motors Co, but far below Apple Inc\u2019s $921 billion.  The plan comes after Tesla\u2019s much-anticipated Model 3 sedan missed several production targets and as many on Wall Street expect the company to launch another round of capital raising.  \u201cWe see Elon Musk\u2019s ambitious long-term awards plan as an aspirational marketing tool to attract talent and capital ahead of an upward inflection in competition\u201d for electric and autonomous vehicles, said Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, who has been bullish on Tesla shares.  Musk could earn more than $70 billion in incremental compensation through the deal, Jonas estimated. Tesla itself put Musk\u2019s maximum gain at $55.8 billion.  With the new plan, Tesla effectively quietened speculation that Musk may be planning to quit as the targets require him to remain as chief executive or serve as both executive chairman and chief product officer.  Tesla noted, however, that the deal provides \u201cthe flexibility to bring in another CEO who would report to Elon at some point in the future.\u201d The company added that there was no current intention for this to happen.  Some investors worry that Musk\u2019s ambition to build Tesla into a behemoth will severely stretch its production capabilities, aggravating production delays and stretching Tesla\u2019s high cash burn rate.  Meanwhile, a host of global automakers from Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) to Ford Motor Co plan to introduce new electric vehicles into the marketplace in coming years, posing a major threat.  Tesla\u2019s shares, which gained 46 percent last year, closed 0.3 percent higher at $352.79.

Tesla/Handout via REUTERS  NEW TERMS  The new performance award consists of a 10-year grant of stock options that vest in 12 tranches tied to milestones.  The company\u2019s market value must increase to $100 billion for the first tranche to vest and must continue to increase in additional $50 billion increments for the remaining 11 tranches.  Musk, also Tesla\u2019s chairman, was an early investor in the company and is now its biggest shareholder, owning about a fifth of all shares outstanding.  He has founded several companies, including rocket maker SpaceX and The Boring Company - leading some to speculate that his interest in leading Tesla could eventually wane. His net worth is about $20 billion, according to Forbes.  Musk has vowed that Tesla will become \u201cthe best manufacturer on Earth,\u201d helped by a new, highly automated assembly line and a simpler design for its Model 3 sedan. However, production woes have slowed deliveries.  While Tesla\u2019s luxury Model S sedans and Model X SUVs have earned it a legion of fans for its technical innovations and respect from the automotive industry, it is the more mass-market Model 3 sedan that is key to the company\u2019s long-term viability.  The company said on Tuesday it must meet a set of escalating revenue and adjusted EBITDA targets for Musk to earn compensation tied to the operational milestones.  For each tranche, Musk will vest in stock options that correspond to about 1.69 million shares, or 1 percent of Tesla\u2019s current total outstanding shares.  The performance award was created by the company\u2019s board in consultation with third party compensation consultant Compensia Inc. It requires the approval of Tesla\u2019s shareholders.  Musk and his brother Kimbal did not participate in the more than six-month process. Shareholders, excluding the Musks, will be asked to vote on it in a special shareholder scheduled in late March.", "stock": "TSLA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-01-23", "source": "reuters", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-ceo/tesla-says-ceo-musk-to-get-paid-only-when-company-performs-well-idUSKBN1FC0VN"}, {"article": "LOS GATOS, California (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) said on Friday that a Tesla Model X involved a fatal crash in California last week had activated its Autopilot system, raising new questions about the semi-autonomous system that handles some driving tasks.
