REUTERS/Mike Segar  Apple said it had appointed Oliver Schusser as vice president of Apple Music and international content. Schusser, who joined Apple 14 years ago, will report directly to Apple senior vice president Eddy Cue and will also oversee Apple\u2019s services outside the United States, including the App Store and iTunes.  Apple\u2019s top streaming music rival Spotify Technology SA has 71 million so-called premium subscribers, a figure that includes users who have given the company a credit card number for a free trial. Spotify became a public company earlier this month after holding a so-called direct listing on the New York Stock Exchange.  On a comparable basis, the Apple Music service has 48 million subscribers, 40 million of whom are paying subscribers and 8 million of whom are on a free trial, Apple said. Both firms charge $9.99 a month for streaming music but provide discounts for student and family plans.  Variety magazine earlier reported the new subscriber figures and Schusser\u2019s promotion. He previously built up Apple\u2019s services businesses outside the U.S. in 155 markets, including China, Japan and Latin America, Apple said.  Apple\u2019s services business, which includes Apple Music, the App Store and iCloud, is becoming increasingly important to the Apple\u2019s financial outlook because the smart phone market has matured and iPhone sales growth has slowed. In its most recent quarter, Apple\u2019s services business grew 18 percent to $8.4 billion, missing analyst expectations of $8.6 billion.

John Gerzema, CEO of the Harris Poll, told Reuters in an interview that the likely reason Apple and Google fell was that they have not introduced as many attention-grabbing products as they did in past years, such as when Google rolled out free offerings like its Google Docs word processor or Google Maps and Apple\u2019s then-CEO Steve Jobs introduced the iPod, iPhone and iPad.  \u201cGoogle and Apple, at this moment, are sort of in valleys,\u201d Gerzema said. \u201cWe\u2019re not quite to self-driving cars yet.

Gerzema attributed Amazon\u2019s ranking to its expanding footprint in consumers\u2019 lives into areas like groceries via its Whole Foods acquisition.

That is $141 billion more than the $752 billion market value of Amazon, the world\u2019s third most valuable publicly listed company, but Amazon has been quickly closing the gap.  (For graphic on Market Capitalization: Apple vs Amazon.com vs Alphabet, click: reut.rs/2Fn9hzA)  Amazon\u2019s stock has surged 83 percent over the past year, bolstered by scorchingly fast revenue growth as more shopping moves online and businesses shift their computing operations to the cloud, where Amazon Web Services leads the market.  In January, Amazon announced that it, Berkshire Hathaway Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co would form a company to cut health care costs for their employees, which was widely seen as a threat to the existing U.S. healthcare system and underscored Amazon\u2019s ability to disrupt markets.  Amazon dislodged Microsoft Corp as the No. 3 U.S. company by market capitalization in February.  At $783 billion, Alphabet Inc has the second largest market capitalization. The Google parent company\u2019s stock has grown about 33 percent over the past year, faster than Apple but far slower than Amazon.  Meanwhile, optimism about Apple\u2019s iPhone X has given way to concerns that demand for the $1,000 device may be weaker than expected.  To be sure, past stock gains are not a reliable predictor of future performance, and the surge in Amazon shares in recent years has been exceptional by most standards.  But if Amazon\u2019s stock were to keep growing on the trajectory seen over the past year, the company\u2019s market capitalization would hit $1 trillion in late August. Apple would reach $1 trillion around a week later if its stock price continued to rise at the same pace seen over the past year.  Alphabet would not reach $1 trillion until 2019 if its stock price continued to rise at the same pace seen over the past year.

Analysts on average expect Apple\u2019s stock price to rise 11 percent and reach $195 within the next 12 months, which would put its market capitalization at $989 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Apple said the base expanded 30 percent from two years ago to 1.3 billion.  That increase should have been seen as positive because Apple aims to become less dependent on selling iPhones and shift to selling its existing customers services like Apple Music or add-on devices like the Apple Watch or AirPods.  But analysts voiced skepticism. Apple's best-selling product, the iPhone, has seen relatively flat unit sales over the same two-year period. On Apple's earnings conference call, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said that the combination of trends implies users are hanging on to their devices longer, and he asked Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook whether investors should be worried about that.  Cook responded that it was up to investors to decide what to focus on, but said he was comfortable with customers buying used iPhones.  When customers sell their old iPhone for a new one, the old iPhone \"winds up with another customer somewhere else that is perfectly fine with having a previously owned iPhone. And so I view all of that to be incredibly positive. It's more people on iPhones, the better,\" Cook said.  Laura Martin of Needham & Co pressed Cook on whether the larger device base meant more devices per user, or more users - an important question, because a user with both an iPad and iPhone is likely to only purchase one Apple Music subscription, for example.  Cook said \"there are many, many, many more\" Apple users than two years ago but declined to give an actual figure.  The signals on how well Apple is monetizing users were mixed. Sales of its \"wearable\" accessories - Beats headphones, AirPods and the Apple Watch - were up 70 percent year-over-year in the fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 30. But services revenue - which includes Apple Music, iCloud and the App Store - fell short of analysts' expectations for the December quarter, at $8.4 billion, and was down slightly from the previous quarter.  Apple has yet to disclose plans for how it will distribute the television shows in which it has been investing in recent months, which could become a large business.  \"They've been building up the services business for several years, knowing full well that at some point the gravy train on smart phones is going to end,\" said Bob O'Donnell, head of Technalysis Research.

Apple is already facing lawsuits in the United States and elsewhere over accusations of having defrauded iPhone users by slowing down devices without warning to compensate for poor battery performance and to push clients into buying new phones.  The South Korean advocacy group, Citizens United for Consumer Sovereignty, in its complaint submitted on Thursday accused Apple of destruction of property and fraud.  \"For the sake of its loyal fans, Apple has to take responsibility over the slowing iPhones,\" Park Soon-jang, an official at the advocacy group told Reuters by phone on Friday.  The group also represents about 120 plaintiffs in a civil damage suit against Apple filed earlier this month.

Apple Korea, the U.S. tech firm's South Korean subsidiary, was not immediately available for comment.

Apple runs one of the largest manufacturing chains in the world, but most of the work is done at factories owned by contractors.  Apple audited 756 suppliers in 30 countries, 197 of which it was auditing for the first time.  Apple said in its annual supplier responsibility report that the proportion of \"low performers,\" or suppliers scoring less than 59 points on its 100-point scale, fell to 1 percent in 2017 from 3 percent in 2016 and 14 percent in 2014. \"High performers\" with scores of more than 90 rose to a record high of 59 percent from 47 percent the year before.  Apple found 44 so-called \"core violations\" of its labor rules in 2017, double the previous year. Those included three instances of employees forced to pay excessive fees for a job, a practice Apple banned in 2015.  In one case, over 700 foreign contract workers recruited from the Philippines were charged a total of $1 million to work for a supplier. Apple said it forced the supplier to repay the money.  Compliance with Apple's 60-hour work week fell to 94 percent of suppliers from 98 percent the year before. Moreover, Apple said it uncovered 38 cases of falsification of working hours data in 2017, up from 9 cases the year before.  Apple said the increase was driven by the fact that it brought on a number of new suppliers in 2017 and started tracking the working hours data of 1.3 million supplier employees, 30 percent more than in previous years.  In the report, Apple also said it was launching a new women's' health initiative at its supplier plants, with a goal of reaching 1 million women by 2020. And it said that it had launched a program in China to train workers to become factory line leaders, who often make 20 percent to 30 percent more than line workers.  On Wednesday, Apple also issued its so-called conflict minerals report, which is required by United States securities regulators. The report lists suppliers of sensitive metals such as tin and gold.  Apple company said that 16 smelters and refiners left its supply chain in 2017, 10 of which were dropped because they would not participate in a third-party audit of their practices. Six left of their own accord.  Apple also outlined new rules on student labor after a discovery last year that some Chinese students were working more than 11 hours a day assembling its iPhone X.

Major technology companies are battling for dominance in U.S. schools, a market seen as important for hooking young consumers.  Apple in March 2017 lowered the price of its 9.7-inch tablet to $329, the lowest starting price ever for one of its full-sized tablets. But laptops running operating systems by Alphabet Inc's Google or Microsoft Corp can be had for less than $200.  Apple's previous price cutting, along with software changes, have been followed by an improvement in iPad sales. Analysts believe the teacher- and student-geared event on Tuesday at Lane Tech College Prep High School will include an update to its iPad lineup, including possibly a lower-priced model.  Apple made up just 17 percent of the K-12 U.S. educational market in the third quarter, according to data from Futuresource Consulting. Meanwhile 60 percent of mobile computing shipments to schools ran Google's Chrome operating system, and 22 percent had Windows.  Chromebooks sold by Dell Technologies Inc can be had for as little as $189. Microsoft last year introduced an education-focused laptop from partner Lenovo Group Ltd running Window 10 S.  Apple in recent years made changes to its operating system so that more than one student can log into an iPad, and to its software to let teachers better manage groups of students.  But it faces a tough battle in the educational market given the popularity of Google and Microsoft's cloud-based productivity suites, said Carolina Milanesi of Creative Strategies. Google's G Suite fueled Chromebook sales because it was seen as easy to use to manage assignments.  \"Most teachers don't look past G Suite for education,\" she said. Apple has iWork, which added features in recent years but remains less familiar to teachers than Google's productivity suite or Microsoft's Office.  Education sales for iPads rose 32 percent to more than 1 million units in Apple's fiscal third quarter. Sales of iPads made up just 8.3 percent of Apple's $229.2 billion total revenue last year, however, compared with the nearly 62 percent of sales generated by iPhones.  Apple needs to keep working to regain market share in schools to get children interested in its devices later on, said TECHnalysis Research founder Bob O'Donnell.  \"It's more about the psychology of driving long-term preference for the (Apple) platform. It's more strategic than financial,\" he said.

Young is his own case in point. He sees his experience \u2014 three tours in Iraq \u2014 as far from heroic. He is at least as disturbed by his duty as he is proud of it. These contradictory feelings are a central theme in his book. Years removed, he both loathes and pines for the man he became in the Marine Corps.

Longbow Research analyst Shawn Harrison lowered his rating on the technology giant to \u201cneutral\u201d from \u201cbuy\u201d on Wednesday, reflecting the view among some Wall Street researchers that the latest group of iPhones will deliver modest sales performance. He didn\u2019t specify a price target.  \u201cWe now forecast only a good, not great iPhone cycle,\u201d Mr. Harrison wrote in a research note.  He said the more expensive price point of the X model may hinder some demand and the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus models have received a \u201clukewarm\u201d reception, both of which could restrain growth in iPhone shipments. He estimates that iPhone production growth will be in the high-single digits, lower than the consensus view of 10% that he cites.  \u201cAlthough there are now expanded drivers to AAPL\u2019s business, the iPhone continues to wag the dog,\u201d Mr. Harrison wrote. \u201cGiven our change in estimated iPhone growth profile near term, we anticipate this dynamic will limit upside stock appreciation.\u201d  Wall Street analysts have historically been hesitant to bet against Apple Inc., whose shares are up 47% over the last 12 months and 670% in the past decade. Twenty-nine of 37 analysts tracked by FactSet have \u201cbuy\u201d or \u201coverweight\u201d ratings on the stock, with an average price target of $192.73. There are no \u201csell\u201d or \u201cunderweight\u201d ratings.  The average analyst price target has increased each month for the past 14, according to FactSet data. Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts, for example, lifted their price target on the stock to $200 from $180 on Wednesday.  Shares were down 0.2% to $175.88 in recent trading Wednesday.  Many analysts have cited factors that could drive the stock higher, such as a tax-code overhaul, which is likely to encourage companies to bring home cash held overseas and could be handed to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. Apple has also seen higher demand for other products such as its Mac and iPad recently.  Longbow\u2019s downgrade appears to be the second among analysts in the last month.

Photo: Scott Olson/Getty Images  The launch of Apple Inc.\u2019s AAPL 0.34% new iPad in a Chicago high school is both an effort to better serve students and one to fend off Google, which has caught up and passed the once-dominant player in the education market.  Apple CEO Tim Cook gathered media in Chicago to lay out its newest efforts geared toward the education market. They include a new suite of software services along with an updated iPad. The new tablet adds the company\u2019s latest mobile processor with some other upgrades for the same price as its predecessor. That includes a 9% price discount for schools.  Apple last updated its iPad lineup a year ago, culling some offerings while trimming the price on its flagship 9.7-inch version. That didn\u2019t arrest a long-running decline in sales for the pioneering tablet. iPad unit sales fell 4% in the fiscal year ended September, and Wall Street expects another 6% decline for the current year. But Tuesday\u2019s announcement wasn\u2019t simply Apple trying to bolster what is now its fourth-largest business, behind the iPhone, services and Mac in terms of annual revenue. The company has lost significant ground to arch-rival Google in the education market. Apple accounted for nearly half of the laptops and tablets sold in the U.S. K-12 market in 2013, while Google\u2019s Chromebooks accounted for 20%, up from 1% a year earlier, according to Futuresource Consulting. Last year, devices running Google\u2019s Chrome OS accounted for 58% of that market.

Google, owned by Alphabet Inc., GOOGL -0.12% has the advantage of both price and ubiquity. The cheapest Chromebooks are about 40% less than the cheapest iPad, and Google\u2019s G-Suite of services is already widespread in schools. Gmail alone passed the 1-billion-user mark two years ago. Apple\u2019s software often gets high marks. But the company\u2019s software and services only work on its own equipment. That means the company\u2019s prospects are always closely tied to its ability to sell devices. And since those devices still drive the majority of Apple\u2019s operating profits, the company can\u2019t really afford to compete on price. Google, which doesn\u2019t even make most of the Chromebooks bearing its operating system, has no such limitations. Apple\u2019s approach has served it well overall. But in budget-constrained markets like education, the right price isn\u2019t always one the company can meet.

In its first major product event of the year, Apple will return to its roots in the education market. The event on Tuesday at Lane Technical College Prep High School in Chicago will mark the first time Apple has held a product launch geared toward education since 2012 when it unveiled a tool for designing e-books for the iPad. It\u2019s also a rare occasion for an Apple confab outside its home state of California.  A second grader works on an Apple Inc. iPad in Sandy, Utah. Photographer: George Frey/Bloomberg  In Chicago, the world\u2019s most-valuable technology company plans to show off a new version of its cheapest iPad that should appeal to the education market, said people familiar with the matter. The company will also showcase new software for the classroom, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private plans. Apple declined to comment.  Steve Jobs made schools a priority for Apple early in its life. But as the company has driven toward mass-market and higher-margin products in recent years, Google and Microsoft have had success breaking into classrooms with inexpensive laptops and tablets. Last year, the global educational technology market generated $17.7 billion in revenue, according to research firm Frost & Sullivan.  Apple accounted for 17 percent of mobile computing shipments to American students in kindergarten through high school, according to data from the third quarter published by Futuresource Consulting. Devices running Google\u2019s operating systems on Chromebooks or Android tablets held 60 percent of the market, and Windows PCs had 22 percent. While Macs and iPads make up less than 20 percent of Apple\u2019s sales combined, students and teachers are a key market to drive future purchases.  A new, cheaper MacBook laptop is in the works and likely destined to replace the MacBook Air at a price less than $1,000, but it probably won\u2019t be ready in time for next week, the people said. The MacBook Air, introduced about a decade ago, hasn\u2019t seen a major change since 2010, the same year the iPad came out. Although the laptop is popular with college students, it has languished as Apple focuses on more expensive Macs.  Rival laptops have made inroads into the education market lately, a field that originally helped Apple make its name. The sector is prized among industry giants because students learn to use a certain type of device, then head into the workforce and spread the technology wider.  With a recent advertising onslaught, Apple is hoping to capture more young minds with the iPad. The company has revised its tablet strategy over the years by releasing different versions at a variety of price points. That\u2019s helped the iPad business return to growth after multiple declining quarters. Still, demand for tablets is weak. According to research firm IDC, the market shrank by about 7 percent in 2017. Apple grew 3 percent last year and leads the industry with about a quarter of the market.  Apple's Tablet Roller Coaster iPad growth is returning after sales slowed for several quarters  Apple currently offers a slew of different education-related software. The company\u2019s Classroom app for the iPad lets teachers manage Apple devices that are assigned to students for their classwork. There\u2019s also an iTunes U app that lets teachers issue homework, grade assignments and post lessons online. It also lets students complete assignments and take tests. The company offers a software coding curriculum via the Swift Playgrounds app and sells interactive textbooks through its e-book store.  More software is coming. Apple is working on a new version of the iBooks app that\u2019s more in line with the design of the App Store, though it\u2019s unclear if it\u2019ll be shown next week, people familiar with the project have said.  In an invitation to the Chicago event, Apple said it will introduce \u201ccreative new ideas for teachers and students.\u201d Having a venue where attendees can see the new technology in action inside a classroom would be a sound strategy for a company that focuses its announcements on live demonstrations.  Next week\u2019s event will also provide an opportunity for Apple to boast about the work it\u2019s doing with Chicago schools. In December, the company partnered with the city\u2019s public school system and City Colleges of Chicago on a coding curriculum for thousands of local students. Apple has also discussed additional education-related programs with the city, people familiar with the talks said.  According to Apple\u2019s website, the school where the event will take place is not an \u201cApple Distinguished School,\u201d a designation given to institutions with curriculum that uses Apple products and provides iPads to all students.  Apple has tried citywide iPad deals for students in the past, with little success. In 2013, the Los Angeles Unified School District said it would spend $30 million to provide some students with iPads. The deal was expected to become a $1.3 billion initiative to give every student in the district an iPad, but it fell apart.  Such a deal won\u2019t be announced with Chicago next week, people familiar with the plans said. But the city could see more of Apple in the future.

She was racist, xenophobic and downright filthy. At one point, she said the Holocaust did not happen. But she was old technology.  Let loose on the internet nearly two years ago, Tay was an experimental system built by Microsoft. She was designed to chat with digital hipsters in breezy, sometimes irreverent lingo, and American netizens quickly realized they could coax her into spewing vile and offensive language. This was largely the result of a simple design flaw \u2014 Tay was programmed to repeat what was said to her \u2014 but the damage was done. Within hours, Microsoft shut her down for good.  Since then, a new breed of conversational technology has emerged inside Microsoft and other internet giants that is far more nimble and effective than the techniques that underpinned Tay. And researchers believe these new systems will improve at an even faster rate when they are let loose on the internet. But sometimes, like Tay, these conversational systems reflect the worst of human nature. And given the history here, companies like Microsoft are reluctant to set them free \u2014 at least for now.  These systems do not simply repeat what is said to them or respond with canned answers. They teach themselves to carry on a conversation by carefully analyzing reams of real human dialogue. At Microsoft, for instance, a new system learns to chat by analyzing thousands of online discussions pulled from services like Twitter and Reddit. When you send this bot a message, it chooses a response after generating dozens of possibilities and ranking each according to how well it mirrors those human conversations.  If you complain about breaking your ankle during a football game, it is nimble enough to give you some sympathy. \u201cOuch, that\u2019s not good,\u201d it might say. \u201cHope your ankle feels better soon.\u201d If you mention house guests or dinner plans, it responds in remarkably precise and familiar ways.  marcy79  conversational_bot  Closest match to human speech Closest match to human speech Lower-ranking potential responses Lower-ranking potential responses  Despite its sophistication, this conversational system can also be nonsensical, impolite and even offensive at times. If you mention your company\u2019s C.E.O., it may assume you are talking about a man \u2014 unaware that women are chief executives, too. If you ask a simple question, you may get a cheeky reply.  marcy79  conversational_bot    Microsoft\u2019s researchers believe they can significantly improve this technology by having it chat with large numbers of people. This would help identify its flaws and generate much sharper conversational data for the system to learn from. \u201cIt is a problem if we can\u2019t get this in front of real users \u2014 and have them tell us what is right and what isn\u2019t,\u201d said a longtime Microsoft researcher, Bill Dolan.  But there lies the conundrum. Because its flaws could spark public complaints \u2014 and bad press \u2014 Microsoft is wary of pushing this technology onto the internet.  The project represents a much wider effort to build a new breed of computing system that is truly conversational. At companies like Facebook, Amazon and Salesforce as well as Microsoft, the hope is that this technology will provide smoother and easier ways of interacting with machines \u2014 easier than a keyboard and mouse, easier than a touch-screen, easier than Siri and other digital assistants now on the market, which are still a long way from fluid conversation.  For years, Silicon Valley companies trumpeted \u201cchatbots\u201d that could help you, say, book your next plane flight or solve a problem with your new computer tablet. But these have never lived up to the billing, providing little more than canned responses to common queries.  Now, thanks to the rise of algorithms that can quickly learn tasks on their own, research in conversational computing is advancing. But the industry as a whole faces the same problem as Microsoft: The new breed of chatbot talks more like a human, but that is not always a good thing.  \u201cIt is more powerful,\u201d said Alex Lebrun, who works on similar conversational systems at Facebook\u2019s artificial intelligence lab in Paris. \u201cBut it is more dangerous.\u201d  The new breed relies on \u201cneural networks,\u201d complex algorithms that can learn tasks by identifying patterns in large pools of data. Over the last five years, these algorithms have accelerated the evolution of systems that can automatically recognize faces and objects, identify commands spoken into smartphones, and translate from one language to another. They are also speeding the development of conversational systems \u2014 though this research is significantly more complex and will take longer to mature.  It may seem surprising that Microsoft researchers are training their conversational system on dialogue from Twitter and Reddit, two social networking services known for vitriolic content. But even on Twitter and Reddit, people are generally civil when they really fall into conversation, and these services are brimming with this kind of dialogue.  Microsoft researchers massage the conversational data they load into the system in small ways, but for the most part, they simply feed the raw dialogues into their neural networks, and these algorithms therefore learn from interactions that are very human. According to Mr. Dolan, in analyzing this data, the system learns to perform well even in the face of poor spelling and grammar. If you type \u201cwinne tonight drink resttaurant,\u201d it might respond with: \u201ci\u2019m not a fan of wine.\u201d It can engage in a real back-and-forth dialogue, asking for everything it needs to, say, connect with you on Linkedin. And for the most part, it behaves with civility.  Top 25 Responses to \u201cwho's Adele?\u201d  When Microsoft\u2019s conversational system receives a message, it generates dozens of possible responses and ranks each according to how well it mirrors human dialogue. In this case, the system knows enough about the world to identify Adele as a singer.  Response Rank she's a singer 1 i don't know who adele is. 2 she is a singer 3 lana del rey 4 i don't know who she is but she is a singer 5 i don't know who she is but she's a singer 6 i don't know, i'm not a fan of adele 7 lana del ray 8 i don't know who she is, she's a singer 9 who is adele 10 i don't know who she is. she's a singer 11 i don't know who she is but she's a good singer 12 i don't know who she is. i'm not a fan of adele 13 i don't know who she is but she is a very good singer 14 i don't know who she is. she is a singer 15 i don't know her name. she's a singer 16 i don't know her name, she's a singer 17 she's not a singer 18 i don't know, i've never heard of her before 19 you don't know her 20 i don't know her name 21 i don't know, i've never heard of her 22 katy perry 23 i don't know who she is but i don't know her name 24 i don't really know who she is but i don't know her name 25 Source: Microsoft  But researchers must also deal with the unexpected. Though these conversational systems are generally civil, they are sometimes rude \u2014 or worse. It is not just that the technology is new and flawed. Because they learn from vast amounts of human conversation, they learn from the mistakes we humans make, and the prejudice we exhibit.  Mr. Lebrun estimated that once in every thousand responses, this new breed of chatbot will say something racist or aggressive or otherwise unwanted. Researchers can fix these problems, but that involves gathering more and better data, or tweaking the algorithms through a process of extreme trial and error.  This is a problem for A.I. services in general. More than two years ago, a software developer noticed that the new Google Photos service was identifying black people as gorillas. Google promptly barred the service from identifying gorillas and similar animals, and it has yet to provide a fix.  But identifying and solving problems with conversational systems is harder, just because the scope of these systems \u2014 general dialogue \u2014 is so large. Image recognition is a single task. Conversation is many tasks, because it bounces back and forth, and each response can affect all the responses to come.  For this reason, Adam Coates, a partner at the venture capital firm Khosla Ventures who previously oversaw the Silicon Valley A.I. lab attached to the Chinese internet giant Baidu, warns that building a truly conversational system is far more difficult than building services that can recognize giraffes, say, or translate between German and French. \u201cThere is a huge technical barrier here. We really don\u2019t know how to build a personal assistant,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may not be simply a matter of more data. We may be missing a big idea.\u201d  In the short term, many believe, conversational systems will be most effective if they are limited to particular tasks, like asking for IT help or getting medical advice. That is still a long way from a bot that will respond well to anything you say. But Mr. Dolan believes these systems will continue to evolve over the next few years, provided companies like Microsoft can get them in front of the public.", "stock": "MSFT", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-21", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/02/21/technology/conversational-bots.html"}, {"article": "What\u2019s more, more than half of members, 51%, used LinkedIn every few weeks or less often, Pew found.

Microsoft wants to pump that data into artificial-intelligence offerings, business-software services and even its Office productivity tools, such as its Outlook email and calendar programs.  Artificial intelligence could help Microsoft\u2019s Dynamics business play catch-up to Salesforce.com Inc. To that end, Microsoft is using LinkedIn data to help sales representatives target fertile prospects, critical in the so-called customer-relationship management market that Gartner Inc. estimates hit $39.4 billion last year.  Microsoft has started to infuse Office apps with LinkedIn data about contacts, so meeting attendees learn about one another directly from calendar invitations. The company hopes that level of integration will give its venerable franchise a leg up against Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Gmail.  Applying artificial-intelligence algorithms to LinkedIn data could create new revenue opportunities for Microsoft, said Goldman Sachs & Co. analyst Heather Bellini. \u201cThis is a company that has different ways to monetize than it used to,\u201d she said.  LinkedIn is about to roll out a passel of features aimed at drawing people regularly. For the past year, its engineers have worked on Project Agora, revamping everything from the site\u2019s news feed to the service that lets members message one another.  This spring, LinkedIn will add an \u201cinterest panel\u201d to members\u2019 home pages that will include groups they\u2019ve joined and hashtags they\u2019ve followed\u2014features intended to keep members coming back to learn the latest on topics that matter to them. By summer, LinkedIn will add content from groups into news feeds and notify members of such posts. That way, members will see posts that are related to their interests and won\u2019t be put off by posts from connections with whom they have little in common.  Still, it is a steep challenge to get members to carve out more time for the service, particularly if they turn to LinkedIn only when looking for work or seeking out sales leads, said TJ Keitt, a senior analyst at Forrester Research Inc.  \u201cThere are a ton of people that don\u2019t have an immediate need to engage with it,\u201d Mr. Keitt said.  The goal of Project Agora, named after the public meeting spaces in ancient Greece, is to convince members that LinkedIn is also a place to hone professional skills, find mentors and share knowledge to solve business problems.  \u201cWe need to make LinkedIn a place where people talk to one another,\u201d said Kiran Prasad, vice president of LinkedIn Product, who leads the project.  Mr. Prasad recognizes the challenge of changing people\u2019s perceptions of LinkedIn as just a place to look for new job opportunities. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re under an illusion that it\u2019s going to happen on day one,\u201d he said.  Recent efforts to boost engagement, such as adding videos to help professionals learn new skills and editorially curated content tailored in part to members\u2019 industries, are working, said Jeff Weiner, LinkedIn\u2019s chief executive.  LinkedIn said \u201csessions,\u201d which track each time members use the service more than 30 minutes after their prior activity, have grown more than 20% for five consecutive quarters. LinkedIn declined to give more specific data.  \u201cEngagement has started to meaningfully accelerate for the first time in a long time,\u201d Mr. Weiner said.

The company announced Wednesday that Google Flights will use historical data about flight delays and knowledge of current conditions to determine the likelihood of a flight being delayed. If it thinks there's at least an 80% chance of a delay, it will flag the relevant flight and include its predicted reason for the delay.

Google Flights will also add a function that highlights the restrictions that come with low-cost fares, such as the inability to check a bag for free or use the overhead bins.  The new features address one of the airline industry's biggest problems: transparency.  Airlines have drawn criticism over the years for making flights seem less expensive than they are by hiding added costs like baggage fees and failing to communicate clearly about delays. While airlines are required to include taxes and fees in their listed ticket prices, the US Department of Transportation announced in December 2017 that it would not force airlines to reveal the prices for \"optional services\" like checked or carry-on baggage at the time of purchase.

The number given is a \"perfect number.\"  Google has a history of making mathematical references.  In its Q4 earnings report on Thursday, Google's parent company Alphabet announced plans to buy back some of its stock \u2014 $8,589,869,056 of stock to be exact.  There's a likely reason Google chose that specific value for their planned buyback: It's what mathematicians call a \"perfect number.\"  Perfect numbers are whole numbers with a fun property \u2014 they are the sum of all their proper divisors, or the whole numbers that evenly divide into the original number, except itself. The smallest perfect number is 6: 6 is divisible by 1, 2, 3, and itself. But then take those first three divisors and add them up, and you get 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.  8,589,869,056 is such a number. It has a few too many divisors to write out here \u2014 33 proper divisors in total \u2014 but the sum of its proper divisors does in fact come back up to itself.  In addition to their defining curious property, perfect numbers are relatively rare. They are closely connected to a certain class of prime numbers called Mersenne primes, or prime numbers that are one less than 2 raised to some prime number. Each even perfect number has a corresponding Mersenne prime.  Mersenne primes are interesting because it's relatively computationally easy to check whether a candidate Mersenne prime is in fact prime. Because of that, most of the largest prime numbers yet discovered are Mersenne primes, including the largest currently known prime number, 2 77,232,917 - 1.  Only 50 Mersenne primes have been found so far, which means because of their correspondence, only 50 perfect numbers are known so far. That makes Google's buyback choice quite a special number.  Google has a history of making mathematical references. In 2011, the company bid a multiple of pi in an auction for Nortel Networks' tech patents. Shortly after renaming itself Alphabet in 2015, the company announced a buyback in the amount of $5,099,019,513.59, which happens to be the square root of 26 x 10 18\u2014 26, of course, being the number of letters in the alphabet.

Google Maps is making a major change to help people with access needs: It's adding wheelchair-accessible routes to Google Maps.  When navigating cities, users will now be able to select \"wheelchair accessible\" as an option, and the app will show routes to the destination that the user should be able to navigate safely. It's similar to how you can already choose to request route with less walking or fewer transfers.

TCEHY -3.15% will license each other\u2019s technology patents, a deal that could help the former broaden its toehold in the Chinese market and accelerate the global expansion of the latter.  They entered a long-term patent cross-licensing agreement for a broad range of products and technologies, the two companies said Friday, adding they were open to more cooperation in the future.  \u201cBy working together on agreements such as this, tech companies can focus on building better products and services for their users,\u201d Mike Lee, Google\u2019s head of patents, said in a statement.  Financial terms weren\u2019t disclosed, and neither company commented beyond their statements.  Cross-licensing deals allow companies to license each other\u2019s technology for use in different markets, said Lester Ross, an attorney at WilmerHale in Beijing. Mr. Ross said that cross-licensing deals can restrain competition, but that they also create market efficiencies\u2014for example, reducing the cost of having to file for patents in multiple countries.  Companies such as Samsung Electronics Co. and Apple Inc. have signed such agreements in the past to prevent infringing each other\u2019s technology and regional patents and therefore avoiding expensive lawsuits.  The arrangement is the latest in a string of moves by Google to expand its reach into mainland China, after it pulled out its main search business in 2010 due to concerns about hacking and censorship. Several weeks ago, the Mountain View, Calif.-based company opened an artificial-intelligence lab in Beijing, and this week said it is opening a new Chinese office\u2014in Shenzhen, the city near Hong Kong, where Tencent is based.  Google already operates offices in Beijing and Shanghai, employing about 600 staff. Although Google\u2019s search engine is blocked in China, the offices are used mostly for its ad sales staff and engineers working on its global products. Google will use the new base in Shenzhen in part to tap into the region\u2019s electronics hardware supply chain, according to an email sent to its Chinese employees.  Tencent is China\u2019s largest tech company by market capitalization, and it makes most of its money from videogames. Its WeChat social network app is dominant in China, but has scant reach beyond.  Chris DeAngelis, China general manager for technology consultancy Alliance Development Group, sees the tie-up with Google as a sign of Tencent\u2019s global ambitions.  \u201cIt represents that China\u2019s technology giants have grown up,\u201d Mr. DeAngelis said. \u201cTencent is now a global player.\u201d  Write to Liza Lin at liza.lin@wsj.com and Alyssa Abkowitz at alyssa.abkowitz@wsj.com", "stock": "GOOGL", "label": 1, "date": "2018-01-19", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-and-chinas-tencent-find-being-friends-has-benefits-1516353949"}, {"article": "When Alphabet Inc. closes the deal, it will expand its property holdings in the Chelsea neighborhood, where it already owns 111 Eighth Ave.  When Alphabet Inc. closes the deal, it will expand its property holdings in the Chelsea neighborhood, where it already owns 111 Eighth Ave. Photo: Caitlin Ochs/Bloomberg News  The parent company of Google is expanding its real-estate holdings in Manhattan, with plans to plow more than $2 billion into one of the city\u2019s prime tech neighborhoods.  Under the deal, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL -0.12% entered a contract to buy the Chelsea Market building at 75 Ninth Ave. from Jamestown LP, according to a person familiar with the transaction.  The potential acquisition comes as Amazon.com Inc., narrows its search for a second headquarters, and underscores the large impact the two companies can have on cities, raising real-estate values and adding high-paying jobs. The Alphabet deal also highlights New York City\u2019s ascendance in the past decade as one of the country\u2019s leading technology hubs.  Amazon has named New York City among the 20 finalists to host a second headquarters.  Technology companies have been increasing their share of office space in the Manhattan market over the past several years, with household names such as Amazon, Facebook Inc., Spotify USA and others signing large lease deals.  In the San Francisco Bay Area, tech companies have been gobbling up more space than they need in the short term to ensure they have enough capacity for workers and equipment down the line.  That might be playing out in New York too.

Google already has offices in the 1.2 million-square-foot building, which houses offices on the upper floors and shops and restaurants on the ground and lower-level floors. The building is home to other companies, including Major League Baseball Advanced Media and the Food Network.  The web-search giant also owns the 2.9 million-square-foot building at 111 Eighth Ave., which it bought in 2010. In addition, it has leased more than 200,000 square feet at Pier 57, a former freight terminal. The Chelsea neighborhood and Meatpacking District are part of the Midtown South office submarket, which is a favorite of the technology sector and has had vacancy rates that are among the lowest in the U.S.  New York City\u2019s technology landscape has changed dramatically over the last decade, when skeptics doubted whether its labor force could support a large technology hub.  \u201cAny further long-term real-estate commitments by Google are proof positive that New York is the present and future home for technology innovation and the most fertile ground for talent retention,\u201d said Doug Harmon, of Cushman & Wakefield, a longtime adviser to Jamestown and the broker who worked on this transaction and the sale of 111 Eighth Ave. to Alphabet.  \ufeff GOOGL -0.12% The Chelsea Market deal was reported earlier by the Real Deal.  The potential acquisition of the Chelsea Market building also highlights some of the options that global companies, especially tech companies, are now considering as the new tax law takes effect.

Amazon engineers are working with Nuance Communications Inc. and Voicebox Technologies Corp. to write code that makes in-vehicle apps compatible with several speech-recognition technologies, eliminating the need for developers to make multiple versions. A working group was set up about a month ago and is meeting once a week, with the aim of having the software ready by June.  The catch is that the cars must use Automotive Grade Linux, an open-source platform being developed by Toyota Motor Corp. and other auto manufacturers and suppliers to underpin all software running in the vehicle. The only cars currently on the system are Toyota\u2019s new Camry and Sienna and the Japanese version of the plug-in Prius, though the carmaker plans to expand that list. AGL has been growing too, reaching 114 members currently, up from around 90 a year earlier.

FILE PHOTO: Facebook Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks on stage during the annual Facebook F8 developers conference in San Jose, California, U.S., April 18, 2017. REUTERS/Stephen Lam/File Photo  The company, which has more than 2 billion monthly users, said its members, not experts or Facebook executives, would determine how news outlets rank in terms of trustworthiness. It also said it would put an emphasis on local news sources.  The move is likely to send shockwaves through the media landscape in nearly every country, given the ubiquity of the world\u2019s largest social network and how central it has become in some places to the distribution of news.  Zuckerberg said on Friday he expects recently announced changes to shrink the amount of news on Facebook by 20 percent, to about 4 percent of all content from 5 percent currently.  The chief executive outlined the shakeup in a post on Facebook, saying that starting next week the News Feed, the company\u2019s centerpiece product, would prioritize \u201chigh quality news\u201d over less trusted sources.  \u201cThere\u2019s too much sensationalism, misinformation and polarization in the world today,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote.  \u201cSocial media enables people to spread information faster than ever before, and if we don\u2019t specifically tackle these problems, then we end up amplifying them,\u201d he wrote.  The quality of news on Facebook has been called into question after alleged Russian operatives, for-profit spammers and others spread false reports on the site, including during the 2016 U.S. election campaign.  Two years ago, Facebook users saw hoaxes saying Pope Francis endorsed Republican Donald Trump for U.S. president and that a federal agent investigating Democrat Hillary Clinton was found dead. Facebook initially proposed fighting false stories by letting users flag them.  The change will affect not only links posted by news outlets but also news stories that individuals share, Facebook said.  News organizations immediately began considering how they would fare in the ranking.  FIGHTING FAKE NEWS  The trust ranking will help to address fake news stories, said David Chavern, president of the News Media Alliance, a trade group for old-line U.S. newspapers.  \u201cFor some time, we have argued that Facebook should give priority to news from trusted sources,\u201d he said in a statement.  Tom Gara, opinion editor at BuzzFeed News, wrote on Twitter that he expected partisan outlets to fare worse: \u201cThis sounds like extremely good news for news publishers that aren\u2019t hated by one side or the other.\u201d  Facebook has had a stormy relationship with news organizations, especially those with strong political leanings. In 2016, Republican U.S. lawmakers expressed concern that Facebook, based in liberal Northern California, was suppressing news stories of interest to conservative readers.  Facebook said that ranking by trustworthiness was not intended to directly impact any specific groups of publishers based on their size or ideology.  Zuckerberg said he settled on the idea of surveying Facebook users after rejecting having the company itself rank news outlets\u2019 trustworthiness.  \u201cWe decided that having the community determine which sources are broadly trusted would be most objective,\u201d he wrote in his post.  Facebook said it did not plan to release the survey results because they will represent an incomplete picture of how a story\u2019s position in a person\u2019s feed is determined.  Many factors determine where a post appears in a Facebook user\u2019s News Feed such as subject of the post, who wrote it and who is commenting on it.  Last week, Zuckerberg said the company would change the way it filters posts and videos on News Feed to prioritize what friends and family share.  News Corp, owner of the New York Post and other outlets, responded to the earlier Facebook announcement with a pledge to look for \u201cany signs that the weighting of news sites is politically motivated.\u201d  The Rupert Murdoch-led company had no immediate comment on Friday.", "stock": "FB", "label": 1, "date": "2018-01-19", "source": "reuters", "url": "https://ca.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idCAKBN1F82M2-OCATC"}, {"article": "(Reuters) - Shares in Facebook Inc (FB.O) jumped 3 percent to a record high in early trading on Thursday, after reporting an almost 50 percent jump in quarterly revenue and promises to focus on users\u2019 experience on the social network easing concerns over falling usage.  FILE PHOTO - A picture illustration shows a Facebook logo reflected in a person's eye, in Zenica, March 13, 2015. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic  At least 13 brokerages raised their price targets on the stock by as much as $35. Analysts at BofA Merrill Lynch were most bullish with a $265 price target.  Facebook\u2019s earnings report added to recent jitters around the company by saying that at the end of last year time spent by users had fallen by about 50 million hours a day. Shares fell more than 4 percent in response.  But the verdict from some of the U.S. stock market\u2019s biggest houses focused instead on the company\u2019s promises to do more to deepen engagement and the quality of content users see on their timelines.  \u201cWe applaud FB\u2019s moves to improve the \u2018quality\u2019 of the user experience and believe recent News Feed changes are essentially a mechanism for reducing ad load and making the platform more constructive,\u201d Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Graham said.  Facebook said earlier this month it would change its centerpiece News Feed to prioritize what friends and family share, while reducing the amount of non-advertising content from publishers and brands.  Those changes contributed to a fall in quarterly time spent that added up to about 5 percent on Facebook and 4 percent on its platforms including Instagram.  \u201cWe continue to believe that any slowdown in time spent will be compensated for by higher-quality time spent, and that any trimming of ad load will be compensated for by higher ad pricing,\u201d Graham said.  While the number of daily users in the United States and Canada fell for the first time in Facebook\u2019s history, the average price per ad increased 43 percent in quarter.  One reason for the ad dollars to continue to grow strongly through these changes was that Facebook\u2019s ad targeting tools and offerings deliver return-on-investment for advertisers, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak said.  Out of the 46 analysts that cover Facebook\u2019s stock, 37 now rate it at \u201cbuy\u201d or higher, two at \u201chold\u201d and two at \u201csell\u201d or lower. The median price target for the stock was $222.50.  The company\u2019s shares traded at $192.48, up more than 43 percent in the past 12 months.  \u201cThe competition has failed to keep pace with Facebook, and we believe that its network effect and large user base all but ensure that it remains the dominant social media platform for the next decade and beyond,\u201d said Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter.

The indictment described a multiyear effort by Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency and others to shape American opinions, including by impersonating Americans on Facebook, Instagram, Google\u2019s YouTube and Twitter Inc.  Mueller described a sophistication beyond what Congress had understood about the Russian meddling in the election. At hearings three months ago, Facebook Inc. was criticized for not quickly becoming suspicious of U.S. election ads purchased in Russian rubles. But with stolen American identities and PayPal accounts, the ads would be unlikely to trigger any alarm, and the extent of the campaign may still not be fully known.  PayPal said it is \u201cintensely focused on combating and preventing the illicit use of our services.\u201d  \u201cWe work closely with law enforcement, and did so in this matter, to identify, investigate and stop improper or potentially illegal activity,\u201d the San Jose, California-based company said in a statement.  The indictment alleges the Russian-backed IRA opened U.S. bank accounts with Social Security numbers and identities they\u2019d stolen from Americans. They bought stolen bank account numbers online as well, using them to bypass PayPal\u2019s security system and open accounts, with which they bought Facebook ads.  PayPal accounts were used for general expenses, the purchase of advertisements and to buy buttons, flags and banners for the political rallies organized through the social media scheme, according to the indictment.  The ads purchased by Russian actors on Facebook went through an automated buying system, where they are only flagged if they break rules on the social network related to its community standards. The company has since bolstered the team that reviews ads and is planning to add tools to let users know who is behind them. Still, that is unlikely to solve a problem of stolen identity behind a purchase.  The revelation ratchets up the pressure on Facebook and Twitter to bolster their defenses, or risk government regulation.

A federal judge in San Francisco ruled Monday that the world\u2019s largest social network must face claims that it violated the privacy of millions of users by gathering and storing biometric data without their consent. Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google is fighting similar claims in federal court in Chicago.  U.S. District Judge James Donato\u2019s decision to let the class-action case proceed means that Facebook is still potentially on the hook for fines under a unique Illinois law of $1,000 to $5,000 each time a person\u2019s image is used without permission. A court victory for consumers could lead to new restrictions on Facebook\u2019s use of biometrics in the U.S., similar to those in Europe and Canada.  \u201cWhen an online service simply disregards the Illinois procedures, as Facebook is alleged to have done, the right of the individual to maintain her biometric privacy vanishes into thin air,\u201d Donato wrote in Monday\u2019s ruling. \u201cThe precise harm the Illinois legislature sought to prevent is then realized.\u201d  Donato previously rejected Facebook\u2019s argument that the case had to be dismissed because the attempt to enforce Illinois law runs afoul of its user agreement that requires disputes to be resolved under the laws of California, where it\u2019s based.  Facebook Says Users Can\u2019t Stop It From Using Biometric Data  Courts have struggled over what qualifies as an injury to pursue a privacy case in lawsuits accusing Facebook and Google of siphoning users\u2019 personal information from emails and monitoring their web browsing habits. Suits over selling the data to advertisers have often failed.  In 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court set a \u201cconcrete injury\u201d standard for privacy suits in a case involving search-engine operator Spokeo Inc., a ruling that both sides in the Facebook suit attempted to use to their advantage.  The Illinois residents who sued under the Biometric Information Privacy Act said the 2008 state law gives them a \u201cproperty interest\u201d in the algorithms that constitute their digital identities -- in other words, gives them grounds to accuse Facebook of real harm.  Facebook, which got the case moved to San Francisco from Illinois, argued the users hadn\u2019t suffered a concrete injury such as physical harm, loss of money or property; or a denial of their right to free speech or religion.  Donato concluded that the alleged violation of the user-consent requirement in the Illinois law goes to \u201cthe very privacy rights the Illinois legislature sought to protect.\u201d  \u201cThis injury is worlds away from the trivial harm of a mishandled zip code or credit card receipt,\u201d he wrote.  A spokeswoman for Facebook declined to comment on the ruling.

The revelation comes after a former employee wrote an article for Wired that posited a theory: since Facebook ads are sold through a bidding system, and Trump was targeting people in more rural areas, he likely paid less per ad to reach those people. That prompted a tweet from Brad Parscale, the Trump campaign\u2019s digital director in the 2016 campaign, who was quick to take credit for the efficiency and claiming that he was sure their ads were at least 100 times cheaper. Clinton said the unfair nature of the system needed to be analyzed.

The proposal, written by Ellen Weintraub, a Democrat and vice chair of the commission, would require online advertisements to carry the same disclaimers from their sponsors as do radio, television and print ads. The commission will consider the framework, known as a notice of proposed rule making, at its next public hearing on March 8.  The move comes as tech companies face growing scrutiny in Washington ranging from concerns about market dominance to concerns that online platforms are used for sex trafficking of children.  Congress has been examining how Russians used social media platforms to influence the 2016 election, and bipartisan bills have been introduced in both the House and Senate that would require companies like Facebook and Google to disclose information about sponsors of political ads on their sites, including how much they\u2019re spending and what audiences the ads are focusing on.    FEC Disclaimers  Though the FEC proposal, which was shared by Weintraub, would apply to campaigns, political parties and other organizations that try to influence federal elections, tech companies could also be affected. They might have to adapt their platforms to accommodate the kind of disclaimers the FEC envisions.  In 2011, Facebook asked the FEC for an exemption from disclaimer rules because its ads used a \"sponsored\" tag that did not identify the sponsor, and did not necessarily link back to the sponsor\u2019s website. The election commission deadlocked on granting an exemption.  In the wake of revelations that Facebook, Google and other online sites were used by Russians in 2015 and 2016 to influence Americans on hot button social and political issues, the FEC reopened the rule making process to require more disclosure for online ads. The draft rule would require text and graphic ads to include the name of a sponsor \"in letters of sufficient size to be clearly readable.\"  Political ads on streaming music services or Internet radio stations would have to include oral disclaimers, while candidates buying online video and audio ads would have to state their names and add, \"And I approve of this message.\"  Paid Advertisements  The notice also seeks input on whether political organizations that use free services -- like uploading videos to YouTube -- should be required to say they are responsible for the ads. Under current law, disclaimers are only required on paid advertisements.  The notice, which will require the support of Republican commissioners to be adopted, also tries to anticipate how developing technologies, including virtual and augmented reality, should be regulated.  The last time the FEC issued a ruling on internet advertising was in 2006, the year after YouTube was founded. That ruling required individuals and committees buying online political ads to disclose how much they spent on the ads. It also called for a disclaimer for all \"paid Internet advertising placed on another person\u2019s website,\" such as banner ads. The requirement exempted other forms of Internet communications, such as blog posts.  The six-member commission, which enforces election laws, can include no more than three members from one party. Currently there are three Republicans, one Democrat and one independent. Lee Goodman, a Republican, is stepping down Friday, which will create two vacancies.

Attn: CEO Matthew Segal tells Business Insider that Facebook is emphasizing loyal audiences, interactivity, and longer episodes.  Starting in the fall, Facebook began to greenlight a handful of second seasons for its TV-like \"Watch\" shows. And now \"We Need to Talk,\" Attn:'s relationship advice series starring Nev Schulman (of \"Catfish\" fame) and his wife Laura Perlongo, has gotten a 10-episode order.  Business Insider talked to Attn: CEO Matthew Segal about what it took to get a renewal from Facebook, which has been selective about the series that have made it past season one. Segal said the most important factor was this: \"a loyal, repeat audience.\"  \"I know it's something that Facebook's looking at,\" Segal explained. \"Can viewers return from one episode to the next in the habitual way that implies fandom.\"  This makes sense when you consider what Facebook wants Watch to be. The tech giant is focused on making the Watch tab something that doesn't just rely on the same behavior as the news feed. Facebook wants people to check back for new episodes, like they do on YouTube or traditional TV. (One Watch partner told Business Insider that Facebook would prefer a show with fewer \"views,\" if the audience were coming back week after week, and didn't rely on the virality of a particular episode.)  Talk to your viewers  Segal said the other big factor was the \"interactivity\" of a show. This leans into Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's new mandate of promoting meaningful interactions.  \"Before we went into production on season one, we had Nev and Laura ask people\" what dating topics to cover, Segal said. And in season two, Attn: is going deeper into the fan feedback aspect.  \"For season two it's going to be even more interactive,\" Segal said. \"We are literally going to ask users to comment on their own experiences, and advice.\" Segal said the hosts will ask the audience about topics like how to ask people out, changing gender roles, money troubles, and so on. And there will be segments on the show when Nev and Laura are responding to reader feedback in real-time (though the episodes won't be live).  \"We Need to Talk\" isn't the only show that has used interactivity to find success.  According to a Watch partner, Mike Rowe's show \"Returning the Favor\" has been used by Facebook as an example of a show that's doing really well. Rowe asks for fan feedback on every show. \"We've already proven the best way to get people interested in RTF is to ask them to program each episode,\" he recently told Tubefilter.  Simply bigger  Season two of \"We Need to Talk\" will also be longer, with episodes falling more in the 10-12 minute range versus 3-6 minutes.  \"We've hired a whole writers room for this season, and there's lot of jokes peppered in,\" Segal said, though some of the show is unscripted as well.  There is definitely a bigger budget for this season, though Segal didn't comment on the exact figure. But in general, Facebook seems to be throwing more funding at shows it thinks can move the needle in terms of repeat viewers and interactivity.

Watch Snap's stock trade in real time here.    Snap shares were gaining ground after a report found that Facebook was losing younger users at a faster clip to Snapchat than previously expected.  Snap's stock was up 2.23% on Monday morning at $19.22 a share.  \"While the social media platform was able to count on Instagram to retain that younger audience in the past, Snapchat may now be siphoning away more users,\" according to the eMarketer study.  Social media companies have closely monitored millennials, particularly teenagers, because they represent a large base of sustainable growth.  Yet Facebook is still popular among older age groups, adding monthly users overall. The New York-based marketing firm eMarketer believes Facebook will add around 1% more users in 2018, compared to the previous year.  However, the study found that Facebook will lose 9.3% of US Facebook users between ages 11 and younger. Meanwhile, the number of Facebook users ages 12 to 17 will decline by 5.6% and users aged 18 to 24 will fall by 5.8% in 2018.

It is true that Facebook\u2019s release of personal \u201cfriend data\u201d into the ozone through Cambridge Analytica remains in the news only because of the prevailing superstition that the Facebook monster allowed Donald Trump to be elected president. The idea that omnipotent technology manipulated the 2016 election has greater appeal to advanced progressive thinking than Hillary Clinton\u2019s explanation that married white women sold her out.  But really, all that is a sideshow. The backlash against this technology, the belief that the creature must be controlled, has been building for several years. Along with Google, Facebook is the biggest web target, so Mark Zuckerberg is about to get torched by Congress and any regulator within reach for abusing \u201cdata.\u201d  Data is the oxygen of the internet. Any online click for any reason inputs data. In the beginning this data, organized into things like family Facebook groups or Google Maps or Wikipedia, was seen as good.  For several years BTTP\u2014BTTP being human history Before The Trump Presidency \u2014articles and books poured forth describing the dark side of this technology. In the past year, that criticism has reached critical mass.  Researchers and parents agree that social media is distorting the lives of young people, especially adolescent girls. No one knows what to do about it.  Web forums fill with millions of young men exchanging sexual and political rants. No one knows what to do about it.  Terrorists wallow in jihadist videos on YouTube, brainwashing themselves into acts of mass murder. No one knows what to do about it.  People write articles saying they have forgotten how to read books.  Major advertisers accuse social-media companies of allowing their ads to appear alongside pornography, a bog beyond anyone\u2019s control.  The cyberwarfare spies of Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency ran around the U.S. uncaught for years.  Social media\u2019s contribution to the Arab Spring and Ukraine\u2019s Orange Revolution was an era ago. The technology has been captured since by dictators who use it as an instrument of surveillance and control that would startle Philip K. Dick.  In one week, Facebook the good communitarian has become Facebook the abuser of everyone\u2019s privacy.  The story of Frankenstein endures as a metaphor of good intentions gone haywire because it keeps happening. Some people used to argue that because Albert Einstein explained how energy could be released from atoms, he bore responsibility for the atomic bomb. By this logic blame should fall on Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, for electing Donald Trump.  Do not for a moment think that Mr. Zuckerberg, Mr. Berners-Lee or any of the others who created modern life online are unaware that history may conclude their creations were a mistake.  Mr. Berners-Lee, reacting to the Facebook mess, accused social-media companies of abusing his creation: \u201cThe fact that power is concentrated among so few companies has made it possible to weaponize the web at scale.\u201d  \u201cWeaponize\u201d evokes the idea of dual-use technology, which is tech that can be put to both a peaceful and military purpose, such as rocket guidance systems. The internet has finally been recognized as a dual-use technology, good and bad.  Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s CEO and inheritor of Steve Jobs\u2019s creations, weighed in this week, ironically from China, the global leader in Orwellian surveillance systems. \u201cThe ability of anyone to know what you\u2019ve been browsing about for years,\u201d said Mr. Cook, \u201cwho your contacts are, who their contacts are, things you like and dislike and every intimate detail of your life\u2014from my own point of view it shouldn\u2019t exist.\u201d Of course, the iPhone became the universal gateway into this dystopia.  One can imagine that when Sergey Brin and Larry Page created Google\u2019s early motto, \u201cDon\u2019t Be Evil,\u201d they sensed what Robert Oppenheimer and his colleagues on the Manhattan Project knew: The power of what they had created might be a problem.  Back when superstition ruled the world, the solution to a larger-than-life problem was known as forcing the genie back into the bottle. Today, when algorithms rule the world, one would think that an industry with aggregate IQ greater than any ever assembled could figure this out. But maybe IQ correlates with the problem.

I was in New York with the fall term\u2019s last classes to teach, so I compartmentalized. I didn\u2019t learn he had died until I arrived home at 10:30.  Stunned, I checked to see whether my family had announced our loss. Hours earlier, an acquaintance had posted on my Facebook page: \u201cSorry about your dad.\u201d Others sent condolences privately, but still before I had heard the news. Turned out, everyone had read my 20-year-old nephew Sam\u2019s poignant tribute at 7 p.m.: \u201cThank you for all you have given, Grandpa.\u201d  The speedy digital death messages that night felt devastating. I appreciated everyone\u2019s desire to connect, but there are more-sensitive ways to sympathize online:  Photo: istock/Getty Images  \u2022 Slow down. If you hear of a death secondhand, don\u2019t race to call, text or post. Check if an obituary has been published, if someone has personally shared the news, or if the funeral home has announced a service. Otherwise you could be the messenger. Paper cards may be more thoughtful anyway.  \u2022 Don\u2019t waste money. With broke friends, I\u2019ve sent a check or donated directly to cover burial costs. That wasn\u2019t our case. Flowers and food baskets are generous, but my family preferred all donations to go to the needy. My parents grew up poor, dad a street kid on New York\u2019s Lower East Side. His pride was putting his four kids through college and arranging educational trusts for his grandkids. I finally posted a few of his charities on Facebook: the medical school where he taught and a Hasidic nonprofit that helps kids with special needs. Since my conservative father and I argued politics (he characterized my candidate, Hillary, and her husband as \u201cBonnie and Clyde,\u201d while I called his \u201cDrumpf\u201d), I added the Israel Defense Forces, our shared passion, as a concession. When notices of donations came in, I cherished them as if dad were still doing good in the world.  \u2022 No advice. After we chose Sunday for the funeral, I completed my classes and attended a long-scheduled academic panel. Dad, a fellow workaholic, loved my teaching (\u201cfinally a real job!\u201d).

I love Facebook and don't want to delete it. When I signed up, I made a deal with Facebook and I was OK with it: I get to use it for free and in exchange I willingly share some info about me to let Facebook serve me relevant ads. Sure, Facebook, go ahead and send me all the ads you want about things I want to buy: bicycles, skiing, fitness, fashion, travel, pets, movies, books and so on. It sounded great.  But as Facebook's data privacy scandal has embroiled the company, I've grown increasing disgusted.  Back in 2014, Facebook began watching people as we wander across the internet. At that time, it instituted privacy controls that seemed to put me in control, to tell Facebook which people can see my posts, friends or the public.  But that's only half of the story.  Zuckerberg also repeatedly told Congress that Facebook doesn't share my info directly with advertisers, nor does it sell my data. It uses data on me to decide which ads to show to which people.  But it's harder to tell Facebook which data on me to use for its ads. And Facebook is still tracking more information about me for this purpose than I want. For instance, the Facebook Audience Network is used by mobile apps serves ads in a mobile apps and analyzes what people do with a mobile app.  Ad blocker AdGuard recently analyzed 2,556 popular apps and found 41% of them use Facebook Audience Network. That means, even if you don't use Facebook, these apps could be sharing data about you with Facebook.  By the way, Google does this on an even bigger scale. 65% of the apps that AdGuard analyzes used one of Google's tracking services.  On top of that, if I visit a website that is using the Facebook Pixel, Facebook knows I've been to that website and can show me an ad for the company in my newsfeed. That's creepy and annoying. Pixel is a popular tool used by website owners to track and analyze what you do on their websites.  Now, Zuckerberg insisted many times in his congressional testimony that I can control the ads I see.  It's not easy to do that, but through its Ad Preferences page, I can opt out of seeing ads based on how Facebook is monitoring my internet use by clicking on \"no\" \"no\" and \"no one\" in the settings.  Facebook/Business Insider  I also adjusted what Facebook thinks it knows about me. This requires sifting through the list of stuff it tracks on me, one by one, and deleting.  I started with the \"Your categories\" setting.  Facebook/Business Insider  Next up, I went through the \"Your interests\" settings: what Facebook thinks it knows about me in terms of business, hobbies, sports, travel, etc.. I had to delete them one-by-one, including the ones listed in \"more.\"  Facebook/Business Insider  I started to do the same for the section marked \"Advertisers you've interacted with.\" But after 15 minutes, with no way to know how close I was to the end, I gave up for now. I will come back to it and delete more each day.  This was perhaps the most shocking section, as it involves lists shared with Facebook where my name appears, even though I have no idea who some of these companies are, or how they wound up identified with my Facebook profile. It was also filled with politicians (like Doug Robinson, below), most of whom I didn't know.  Facebook/Business Insider  But because Facebook is ad-supported, it warns that I will still see ads.  Again, I'm A-OK with that, especially ads on topics of interest to me. But I don't get to choose. The advertiser, who is paying the bill, gets to choose.  Facebook says that, even if I limit my interests, it will still show me ads based on the following:  \"Your age, gender or location.  The content in the app or website you're using.  Your activity off of the Facebook Companies.\"  That last bit, \"Facebook Companies\" is particularly worrisome.  In addition to the Facebook Pixel and Facebook Audience Network, Facebook owns a company, Atlas that puts a bit of code on your browser to watch what you do on the internet. Facebook also owns \"Moves,\" a fitness tracking app that monitors your location, if you use that app. And it owns Onovo, a security app that was the subject of another privacy scandal for its policy of sharing data with Facebook.  In other words, while you can control the ads you see, you can't really control the information that Facebook gathers on you.  So, if the nation wants more control over how our lives are being watched, we'll need to push, and probably regulate, Facebook and the whole internet ad industry.  In the meantime, for people like me, that don't want to quit Facebook, we can limit the ads Facebook shows us through its internet spying practices, limiting the financial reward it gets for such creepy behavior.  If you are an ad industry employee with information about surprising or unethical ways internet companies gather and use data, we want to hear it. jbort@businessinsider.com or DM me @Julie188 on Twitter.", "stock": "FB", "label": -1, "date": "2018-04-11", "source": "business-insider", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-control-your-data-on-facebook-like-mark-zuckerberg-says-you-can-2018-4"}, {"article": "\u201cThey don\u2019t delete anything, and that\u2019s a general policy,\u201d said Gabriel Weinberg, the founder of DuckDuckGo, which offers internet privacy tools. He added that data was kept around to eventually help brands serve targeted ads.  Beth Gautier, a Facebook spokeswoman, put it this way: \u201cWhen you delete something, we remove it so it\u2019s not visible or accessible on Facebook.\u201d She added: \u201cYou can also delete your account whenever you want. It may take up to 90 days to delete all backups of data on our servers.\u201d  Digging through your Facebook files is an exercise I highly recommend if you care about how your personal information is stored and used. Here\u2019s what I learned.  Facebook Retains More Data Than We Think  When you download a copy of your Facebook data, you will see a folder containing multiple subfolders and files. The most important one is the \u201cindex\u201d file, which is essentially a raw data set of your Facebook account, where you can click through your profile, friends list, timeline and messages, among other features.  One surprising part of my index file was a section called Contact Info. This contained the 764 names and phone numbers of everyone in my iPhone\u2019s address book. Upon closer inspection, it turned out that Facebook had stored my entire phone book because I had uploaded it when setting up Facebook\u2019s messaging app, Messenger.  This was unsettling. I had hoped Messenger would use my contacts list to find others who were also using the app so that I could connect with them easily \u2014 and hold on to the relevant contact information only for the people who were on Messenger. Yet Facebook kept the entire list, including the phone numbers for my car mechanic, my apartment door buzzer and a pizzeria.  This felt unnecessary, though Facebook holds on to your phone book partly to keep it synchronized with your contacts list on Messenger and to help find people who newly sign up for the messaging service. I opted to turn off synchronizing and deleted all my phone book entries.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  My Facebook data also revealed how little the social network forgets. For instance, in addition to recording the exact date I signed up for Facebook in 2004, there was a record of when I deactivated Facebook in October 2010, only to reactivate it four days later \u2014 something I barely remember doing.  Facebook also kept a history of each time I opened Facebook over the last two years, including which device and web browser I used. On some days, it even logged my locations, like when I was at a hospital two years ago or when I visited Tokyo last year.  Facebook keeps a log of this data as a security measure to flag suspicious logins from unknown devices or locations, similar to how banks send a fraud alert when your credit card number is used in a suspicious location. This practice seemed reasonable, so I didn\u2019t try to purge this information.  But what bothered me was the data that I had explicitly deleted but that lingered in plain sight. On my friends list, Facebook had a record of \u201cRemoved Friends,\u201d a dossier of the 112 people I had removed along with the date I clicked the \u201cUnfriend\u201d button. Why should Facebook remember the people I\u2019ve cut off from my life?  Facebook\u2019s explanation was dissatisfying. The company said it might use my list of deleted friends so that those people did not appear in my feed with the feature \u201cOn This Day,\u201d which resurfaces memories from years past to help people reminisce. I\u2019d rather have the option to delete the list of deleted friends for good.  Photo  The Ad Industry Has Eyes Everywhere  What Facebook retained about me isn\u2019t remotely as creepy as the sheer number of advertisers that have my information in their databases. I found this out when I clicked on the Ads section in my Facebook file, which loaded a history of the dozen ads I had clicked on while browsing the social network.  Lower down, there was a section titled \u201cAdvertisers with your contact info,\u201d followed by a list of roughly 500 brands, the overwhelming majority of which I had never interacted with. Some brands sounded obscure and sketchy \u2014 one was called \u201cMicrophone Check,\u201d which turned out to be a radio show. Other brands were more familiar, like Victoria\u2019s Secret Pink, Good Eggs or AARP.  Facebook said unfamiliar advertisers might appear on the list because they might have obtained my contact information from elsewhere, compiled it into a list of people they wanted to target and uploaded that list into Facebook. Brands can upload their customer lists into a tool called Custom Audiences, which helps them find those same people\u2019s Facebook profiles to serve them ads.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Brands can obtain your information in many different ways. Those include:  \u25a0 Buying information from a data provider like Acxiom, which has amassed one of the world\u2019s largest commercial databases on consumers. Brands can buy different types of customer data sets from a provider, like contact information for people who belong to a certain demographic, and take that information to Facebook to serve targeted ads, said Michael Priem, chief executive of Modern Impact, an advertising firm in Minneapolis.  Last month, Facebook announced that it was limiting its practice of allowing advertisers to target ads using information from third-party data brokers like Acxiom.  \u25a0 Using tracking technologies like web cookies and invisible pixels that load in your web browser to collect information about your browsing activities. There are many different trackers on the web, and Facebook offers 10 different trackers to help brands harvest your information, according to Ghostery, which offers privacy tools that block ads and trackers. The advertisers can take some pieces of data that they have collected with trackers and upload them into the Custom Audiences tool to serve ads to you on Facebook.  \u25a0 Getting your information in simpler ways, too. Someone you shared information with could share it with another entity. Your credit card loyalty program, for example, could share your information with a hotel chain, and that hotel chain could serve you ads on Facebook.  The upshot? Even a Facebook lurker, like myself, who has barely clicked on any digital ads can have personal information exposed to an enormous number of advertisers. This was not entirely surprising, but seeing the list of unfamiliar brands with my contact information in my Facebook file was a dose of reality.  I tried to contact some of these advertisers, like Very Important Puppets, a toymaker, to ask them about what they did with my data. They did not respond.

Knowing this, I also downloaded copies of my Google data with a tool called Google Takeout. The data sets were exponentially larger than my Facebook data. For my personal email account alone, Google\u2019s archive of my data measured eight gigabytes, enough to hold about 2,000 hours of music. By comparison, my Facebook data was about 650 megabytes, the equivalent of about 160 hours of music.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Here was the biggest surprise in what Google collected on me: In a folder labeled Ads, Google kept a history of many news articles I had read, like a Newsweek story about Apple employees walking into glass walls and a New York Times story about the editor of our Modern Love column. I didn\u2019t click on ads for either of these stories, but the search giant logged them because the sites had loaded ads served by Google.  In another folder, labeled Android, Google had a record of apps I had opened on an Android phone since 2015, along with the date and time. This felt like an extraordinary level of detail.  Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  On a brighter note, I downloaded an archive of my LinkedIn data. The data set was less than half a megabyte and contained exactly what I had expected: spreadsheets of my LinkedIn contacts and information I had added to my profile.  Yet that offered little solace.

Tesla.  Does Elon Musk control Tesla Inc.? Colloquially speaking, sure he does: He is Tesla's chief executive officer, the chairman of its board and its largest shareholder. He is also its co-founder, even though he didn't found it, which is a hard trick to pull off at a company that you don't control.  But there is also a narrower question, which is: Is Elon Musk the controlling shareholder of Tesla? That is less obvious. He owns about 22 percent of the stock, which is rather less than a majority, and it's all just normal stock, with no super-voting rights or anything. This narrower question matters because, under Delaware law (Tesla is a Delaware company), there are limits on what a controlling shareholder can do to enrich himself at the expense of a company that he controls. For instance, when Tesla acquired SolarCity Corp. in 2016, when Musk was SolarCity's chairman and largest shareholder (and his cousin was its CEO), and when SolarCity was financially troubled and needed to be bailed out by someone, that looked, to a lot of people, like kind of an awkward transaction.  But Delaware law does not have a category for \"kind of an awkward transaction.\" It has basically two relevant categories: If Musk was the controlling shareholder of Tesla, and caused Tesla to buy SolarCity, then a judge will review the transaction for \"entire fairness\" and, if he finds that the process or price was unfair, he can award damages for shareholders against Musk and the directors. But if Musk was not the controlling shareholder -- if he was just a CEO who happened to own some shares, and who was answerable to the board of directors and shareholders -- then the board's decision to buy SolarCity is subject to \"business judgment\" review, which basically means that the board can do whatever it wants. (Also even if he was the controlling shareholder, he could have avoided entire fairness review \"if at the outset of a self-dealing transaction the controlling stockholder effectively relinquished control over the outcome to an independent committee of disinterested directors and a nonwaivable, fully informed vote of a majority of the minority stockholders.\")  So is he the controlling shareholder? Yesterday a Delaware judge ruled on a motion to dismiss a shareholder lawsuit over the SolarCity deal and decided that it's a \"close call\" but that Musk might have controlled Tesla, so the lawsuit can go forward. The reasons for Musk's control are all the sort of obvious things: He owns a lot of shares, not a majority but enough to sway the vote; he dominates the board of directors and, in particular, dominated the board's discussion of the proposed SolarCity deal (bringing it to the board three times, and curiously never discussing the possibility of buying another solar company instead of SolarCity); he \"has demonstrated a willingness to facilitate the ouster of senior management when displeased\"; and he is central to the company's business, raising money for it and acting as its public face and authoring its \"Master Plan.\" (And while Tesla did require a majority of the non-Musk shareholders to approve the deal, and allowed independent directors to negotiate the price -- which I thought was rather good governance, considering -- Musk was fully involved in the board decisions about whether to do the deal.) You can't really object too much to that conclusion. Intuitively, Tesla is Musk's company, while also being a public company, and using a public company you control to bail out another public company that you also control seems like the sort of thing that controlling-shareholder rules are supposed to be suspicious of.  Still it's a little weird. Musk is the charismatic founder-CEO-visionary of Tesla, sure. But he owns 22 percent of the shares, with 22 percent of the vote. Plenty of other tech-company founder-CEO-visionaries have found much stronger ways to formalize their perpetual control. Mark Zuckerberg owns about 16 percent of the shares of Facebook Inc., but he controls almost 60 percent of the vote, and almost got the company to give him voting control forever even if he sells more of his stock. Evan Spiegel and Robert Murphy are the charismatic founder-visionaries of Snap Inc.; they own less than 40 percent of the stock between them, but control more than 88 percent of the vote. Meanwhile, just being a founder-CEO-visionary who dominates the board, has the ideas, and is the public face of the company is not necessarily enough to keep control, as Travis Kalanick can tell you. The voting power usually doesn't matter, when things are good for the founder-CEO-visionary, but when it matters it matters.  There seem to be two models of governance in large technology companies run by founder-visionaries: There is the founder-visionary-CEO as perpetual owner and controlling shareholder, who jealously guards his rights so that he can't be unseated by insurgent shareholders or directors, and there is the founder-visionary-CEO who actually does give shareholders a vote, and who relies on his charisma and vision to keep the shareholders and directors in line. Those models often come to more or less the same place, but they don't always; Musk has to wake up every day and persuade his shareholders and directors that his charismatic vision is the right one, in a way that Zuckerberg just doesn't. It's a little rough on Musk that he's not actually the controlling shareholder and the law treats him like he is anyway.  In other Tesla news, its bonds are cratering. \"You can see quickly that Tesla is singularly unsuited to using debt,\" wrote Aswath Damodaran back in August, when it was issuing debt. But \"bond investors pretty much ignored the carmaker\u2019s prolific cash burn and repeated failures to meet production targets and lent it $1.8 billion at record-low interest rates.\" I guess investors saw the unsuitability slowly: The bonds \"plunged to a low of 86 cents on the dollar\" yesterday, and Moody's Investors Service downgraded them to a Caa1 rating this week. I have to say that as I spend time this month reading financial-crisis anniversary pieces, I cannot get that worked up about a low-junk-rated money-losing company's bonds trading down to a 7.8 percent yield. As these things go, that's still pretty good.  A warning shot.  How are things at Deutsche Bank AG? Oh great, great, except that it has been widely reported that Chairman Paul Achleitner has grown tired of Chief Executive Officer John Cryan and is openly searching for his replacement. Yesterday Cryan sent out a staff memo saying that he is \"absolutely committed\" to staying, which is not quite the question that was being asked:  \u201cThe fact that Cryan must write his own defense and doesn\u2019t get any backing from Achleitner is a sign of weakness for the CEO,\u201d said Florian Sauerburger, a portfolio manager at Aramea Asset Management, which owns Deutsche Bank stock.  It's true. It rather seems like the intended audience for the memo was Achleitner and the board, and that its message was \"back off.\" \"We need to focus on executing on the strategy that was agreed and signed off by both the management and supervisory boards,\" wrote Cryan, who mentioned the \"destabilizing effect\" of \"widespread rumors\" and urged, \"Let\u2019s not allow ourselves to be thrown off course.\" They're all employee-appropriate sentiments, I guess, but also interpretable as an argument that the noisy search for his replacement should quiet down. Meanwhile there is this:  The person close to Mr Achleitner stressed that replacing Mr Cryan \u201cis not a foregone conclusion at this point\u201d, adding that the chief executive should take the debate as \u201ca warning shot\u201d and redouble efforts to cut costs.  Is that a thing? Is it normal for a board of directors to go around noisily auditioning replacements for their CEO in order to light a fire under the incumbent? It seems rather tough for the incumbent's authority, not to mention his morale. Anyway as long as Cryan is still around he is going to do what he does, which is make cuts at the investment bank, though there too Deutsche seems to be of two minds about everything:  As part of the investment bank review, cuts are being discussed at both big trading businesses -- equities as well as fixed income, currencies and commodities -- because they are expensive and haven\u2019t performed well, said one person. However, the extent of a potential retrenchment is unclear because many traders just got big bonuses in an effort to retain top performers, this person said.  I have to say that getting a big retention bonus and then immediately being laid off is ... not the worst way to go.  The crypto.  Here is a profile of Zhao Changpeng, the founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance, who spent \"several years developing trading systems for companies including Bloomberg L.P.,\" and who is now maybe a billionaire, but who has apparently never met a lawyer? Or something, I don't know, what do you make of this explanation for why Binance lists so many initial coin offerings that have characteristics of unregistered securities:  Zhao said the exchange\u2019s client identification policies are similar to those of some U.S.-based venues and that Binance takes a venture capital-like approach to evaluating the coins it lists, favoring those that are backed by teams with a track record and real products. He also asks issuers to provide Binance with a legal opinion that the coins aren\u2019t securities.  Look. The way venture capital works is that it invests in companies, specifically by buying securities of those companies. If you evaluate coins by examining their team and their products using a \"venture capital-like approach,\" that is because they are companies and they are issuing securities.  Also I have a feeling we should check in on this guy in six months:  \u201cThe less regulation, the better,\u201d said Zachary Ising, a 24-year-old graduate student at California University of Pennsylvania who relies on virtual currency trading for all his income and has a majority of his assets in a Binance account. \u201cI\u2019m confident in Binance\u2019s ability to secure its own platform.\u201d  Elsewhere: \"Russia says Venezuela has not offered to repay debts in cryptocurrency.\" And: \"Reddit Disables Bitcoin Payments.\" Honestly I didn't know that you could pay for Reddit, but if I had known that you could pay for Reddit, I'd have been pretty confident that you could pay for Reddit with Bitcoin. Now you can't.  Blockchain blockchain blockchain.  Here is \"Blockchain Technology for Corporate Governance and Shareholder Activism\" by Anne Lafarre and Christoph Van der Elst. \"Shares are usually held through complex chains of intermediaries,\" they write, and \"these intermediaries not only add transaction costs to shareholder participation per se, there is also high uncertainty that information, including the record of shareholder votes, is correctly channelled between ultimate shareholders and companies in remote participation.\" The solution is of course the blockchain:  In a private blockchain, managed by the company only accessible for shareholders for example on the Hyperledger of IBM, the company and shareholders that hold sufficient shares can place proposals. Smart contracting allows for the private ledger to be structured so that all relevant information including majority rules and access rights that are contained in the articles of association and the law are taken into account. Once a certain proposal is placed in the blockchain, shareholders that hold shares in the company are immediately notified and can exercise their voting rights during a short period. The voting results may become instantly available after a cut-off point, and majority requirements, necessary to render the decision binding and verifiable, need to be reached in a specified timeframe. Shareholders can verify their own transactions, but none of the shareholders should be able to determine what voting decision was taken by other shareholders.  Look, you know, fine. We have talked about exactly these problems -- the complex chain of intermediation in stock voting that leads to uncertainty and reduced participation -- and in fact I have even gone so far as to mutter the word \"blockchain\" in those discussions. But what if you replaced the word \"blockchain\" in the paragraph above with a word like, say, \"website\"? What if the company had a private website where it could put proposals, and a database where it tracked share ownership, and the shareholders could log in to the website and see and vote on proposals? The call here is for a private blockchain -- one administered by the company -- so the trustlessness and decentralization benefits of public blockchains are not relevant. This is just an argument that companies should have better databases for tracking their shareholders, and better user interfaces to allow those shareholders to vote their shares. The blockchain has nothing to do with it, except that people want to read about the blockchain.  Elsewhere, some of the people who piloted blockchain projects realized they were pointless:  DTCC, known as Wall Street\u2019s bookkeeper, recently put the brakes on a blockchain system for the clearing and settlement of repurchase, or repo, agreement transactions, said Murray Pozmanter, head of clearing agency services at the DTCC. The project, which had successfully tested with startup Digital Asset Holdings (DA), was shelved because banks and other potential users believed the same results could be achieved more cheaply using current technology, he said. \u201cBasically, it became a solution in search of a problem,\u201d he said.  Yes! The blockchain project worked! But also so would a database run by a trusted central counterparty such as, just to throw one name out there, DTCC. You could just about imagine someone, somewhere, saying \"the blockchain is a solution to the problem that we rely too much on DTCC to clear and settle repo trades.\" (I mean, it seems like a niche thing to worry about, but you could.) It is harder to imagine DTCC concluding that. And if DTCC is going to run a centralized blockchain, why not just run a centralized database instead?  Virtual reality.  Are we currently living in a computer simulation run for the entertainment or edification of some far more intelligent beings? Sure, why not. I have to say that the best evidence for it is that when people come up with virtual-reality projects, the reality always seems to be so grimly literal. Microsoft Corp., for instance, developed \"a digital room where we could sit at a digital desk and interact with Microsoft programs such as Word,\" which sounds a whole lot like the actual rooms at my house and my office where I sit at an actual desk and interact with Word. And if a virtual-reality desk job isn't quite existentially terrifying enough for you, now you can virtually die at your virtual-reality desk:  Visitors could don VR glasses and earphones to experience having a seizure at work, a failed paramedic rescue, and entrance into the afterlife. Funeral parlor employee Dong Ziyi told The Beijing News that the immersive experience \u201cenables people to better cherish the beauty of life.\u201d  Now we just need a virtual-reality experience of eating lunch at your desk. We really are building all the components of virtual-reality life, and death, under late capitalism. I would na\u00efvely have thought that people would build virtual reality experiences that are, you know, fun, that you can't really get in your daily life. As opposed to, like, \"do some word processing and then die at your desk.\" But I guess the fact that our simulated reality is so much like our boring reality is an argument that our boring reality is itself a simulation.

Situated amid swaths of farmland and a smattering of gas stations, fast-food restaurants, and motels, the Tesla Supercharger station in Kettleman City, California, sits tucked away from the main street that runs underneath the 5 Freeway, on a corner lot that used to be a Burger King drive-thru.  Across the street to the east is a gas station and a Carl's Jr., to the south an auto-repair shop, and to the west two budget hotels.  Farther south across State Route 41, there's a recently built strip mall, curiously named Bravo Farms, whose architecture was designed to resemble old Western saloons of generations past.  The Tesla Supercharger station, unlike the Burger King before it, makes use of nearly all the available space. An expanse of covered solar parking shelters the 40 Superchargers on the lot.

Earth is the bright crescent seen in the background. Elon Musk/SpaceX via Instagram  SpaceX, founded by Elon Musk, recently launched the world's largest operational rocket on February 6.  Falcon Heavy's launch sent Musk's personal 2008 red Tesla Roadster on a voyage toward Mars orbit with a \"Starman\" dummy in the driver's seat.  Planetary scientists are concerned about bacterial contamination on Musk's car in case it crashes into Mars \u2014 a planet that may host alien microbes.  However, new calculations show the Tesla will most likely hit Earth, Venus, or the sun.  On February 6, SpaceX launched the world's most powerful operational rocket, called Falcon Heavy, for the first time.  The launch sent company founder Elon Musk's own red Tesla Roadster on a path that crosses the orbit of Mars. This attracted the attention of researchers worried about an eventual crash into the red planet, which would contaminate the world \u2014 and any alien microbes living there.  But planetary science researchers can now breathe a little easier, if a new study about the Roadster's fate is correct.  Musk put his Roadster on top of the 230-foot-tall rocket with a spacesuit-clad dummy named \"Starman\" in the driver's seat. Launching the car demonstrated Falcon Heavy's capabilities and was reportedly a backup plan for a scientific NASA or military payload.  The Roadster's short-lived yet unparalleled camera feeds, overall silliness (as Musk has described it), and far-flung path through space captured global attention.  But not all of it has proved welcome.  SpaceX founder Elon Musk in a press conference after the launch of Falcon Heavy. Dave Mosher/Business Insider The Planetary Society's Jason Davis bemoaned the planetary protection risk posed by Musk's un-sterilized car crashing into Mars and sprinkling debris coated with bacteria, viruses, and fungi all over the planet. The reason: alien microbes may be hiding out in Martian soil.  \"NASA goes to great lengths sterilizing spacecraft designed to land on Mars, in order to make sure there's no chance of Earthly microbes contaminating the surface,\" Davis wrote in a post before launch. \"Such a contamination could harm existing life and muddle scientific efforts to search for said life.\"  But that risk now appears minimal, according to a new scientific study titled \"The random walk of cars and their collision probabilities with planets.\"  Three researchers at the University of Toronto posted their paper on Tuesday to the pre-print arXiv server and submitted to the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.  Where and when Musk's Tesla will most likely crash  A chart showing the location of Elon Musk's Tesla Roadster in space on February 15, 2018. WhereIsTesla.com  Hanno Rein, an astrophysicist and lead author of the study, said the roughly week-long research came out of advanced orbital-mechanics computer simulations.  \"Earth is the most likely place the car will crash, followed by Venus, and then the sun,\" Rein told Business Insider, and likely within 10 million years \u2014 not hundreds of millions or possibly billions, as Musk has suggested.  To arrive at that conclusion, Rein and his colleagues started with orbital tracking data for the Roadster posted by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Then they plugged that data into simulation software called REBOUND, which allowed them to fast-forward the car's likeliest orbital paths through the solar system over the next few million years.  That data suggest Musk's car will fly out past Mars orbit, spending very little time there, and then swing back around, over and over again.  \"Every 30 years or so, it will come relatively close to the Earth,\" Rein said, where it will get a gravitational tug. \"This causes a change of a few percent in some of the orbital parameters. The distance to the sun would change slightly, for example, and the orbit's eccentricity.\"  The calculations suggest the Roadster will come within one Earth-moon distance of our planet within 100 years, possibly enabling new Earth-based telescope views.  Elon Musk's red Tesla Roadster before launching on a Falcon Heavy rocket toward Mars orbit. Elon Musk/SpaceX; Instagram  But after its third flyby, Rein said the Roadster will take on an increasingly chaotic and somewhat unpredictable path through space. That's because those gravitational tugs near Earth's orbit \u2014 where the car will spend most of its time compared to other bodies in the system \u2014 can \"lead to a huge change afterward,\" Rein said.  By running hundreds of different simulations of those orbital possibilities out to 3.5 million years from today, Rein and his colleagues figured out there's a 6% chance of the Roadster crashing into Earth and a 2.5% chance of crashing into Venus during that time.  \"We've not seen any single collision with Mars in 240 simulations, though we continue to run them and see what happens,\" Rein said. \"The likely outcome is that it will crash, in tens of millions of years, into Earth or Venus or the sun.\"  Astronomers are tracking the car in space  Two other astronomers \u2014 Gianluca Masi of The Virtual Telescope Project and Michael Schwartz of Tenagra Observatories, Ltd. \u2014 also used JPL data to track the Roadster.  Last week, they managed to photograph the car flying beyond the moon moving at a speed of roughly 25,000 miles per hour.  The vehicle is reflective enough to see through a telescope, at least for now, leading to what they called a \"stunning\" animation of several images.  Masi said he and Schwartz will continue to track the Roadster for as long as possible.  \"The object is slowly fading: you can image it now with a 6\" or so scope,\" Masi told Business Insider in an email. \"In one month or so it will need a much larger scope to be imaged (16\" or larger).\"", "stock": "TSLA", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-15", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://uk.businessinsider.com/starman-elon-musk-car-orbit-collision-risk-calculations-2018-2"}, {"article": "Photo  For the past week, as the electric-car maker Tesla has been buffeted by a barrage of negative news, Elon Musk, its chief executive, has offered no public comments on the company\u2019s shaky finances, its slumping stock price or the increasing questions about the safety of its self-driving technology.  He finally responded on Sunday \u2014 with an April Fool\u2019s joke that the company was going bankrupt.  \u201cDespite intense efforts to raise money, including a last-ditch mass sale of Easter Eggs, we are sad to report that Tesla has gone completely and totally bankrupt,\u201d Mr. Musk wrote on Twitter. \u201cSo bankrupt, you can\u2019t believe it.\u201d  A follow-up tweet said, \u201cElon was found passed out against a Tesla Model 3, surrounded by \u2018Teslaquilla\u2019 bottles, the tracks of dried tears still visible on his cheeks.\u201d It was accompanied by a photo of Mr. Musk, seemingly unconscious, under part of a box on which \u201cBankwupt!\u201d had been written in marker.

Reflecting questions about Tesla\u2019s ability to pay off its debt, its bonds have slumped as well. Those that will mature in 2025 traded at about 88 cents on the dollar on Thursday.  A Tesla representative declined to comment on the company\u2019s finances.  But the company\u2019s recent troubles extend beyond its balance sheet. Federal investigators are looking into a fiery crash that killed a Tesla driver last week in California, including the possibility that Autopilot was in use. (Autopilot was in use during a 2016 crash in Florida that killed a Tesla driver, but safety officials concluded that the crash did not result from a flaw in the system but found it lacked safeguards to prevent its misuse.)  And on Thursday, Tesla said it was recalling 123,000 Model S cars made before April 2016 to replace bolts that hold a power-steering motor in place. The bolts can become corroded and break, leaving drivers with only manual steering. The company said no crashes or injuries related to the issue had been reported.  Tesla\u2019s reversal of fortune is a jolt for both the company and its chief executive, who had built a reputation not only as a visionary but also as an achiever, masterminding an automotive brand, breaking ground on a battery plant that would be the world\u2019s biggest building, and launching rockets through his SpaceX venture.  For years, Tesla has ridden a wave of enthusiastic support from its customers and a certain set of investors, even though it generated barely any profit in the 15 years since its founding. Company events to present new models tend to have the feel of a religious revival, with hundreds or thousands of owners cheering wildly at each new pronouncement from Mr. Musk. Anticipation for the Model 3 prompted nearly 400,000 prospective customers to put down deposits of $1,000 each.  In November, before a screaming audience of several hundred guests, Mr. Musk unveiled a battery-powered semi truck and a two-seat roadster. He vowed to begin producing the truck by the end of 2019, even though the company does not have a factory to build it, and is still trying to work the kinks out of the Model 3 assembly process at its manufacturing plant in Fremont, Calif.

You add all that up and there\u2019s a real question about whether this company can deliver what it promises.\u201d  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  There\u2019s no doubt Tesla has achieved some breakthroughs that have left the established automakers scrambling to catch up. It has proved that there is a viable market for electric cars, and that they can command premium prices. It has pioneered methods of upgrading cars through software updates beamed over the air, the way iPhones can download new operating systems.  And it was Autopilot that set off a race to develop advanced driver-assistance systems that can guide cars under certain circumstances and actively prevent collisions \u2014 though Tesla\u2019s technology appears to have been surpassed by the self-driving systems from other companies, including G.M. and the Google spinoff Waymo.  Along the way, Mr. Musk has also courted controversy, including his move in 2016 for Tesla to take over SolarCity, a maker of home solar panels run by his cousin. A group of investors has filed a lawsuit contending that Mr. Musk had a conflict of interest because he was SolarCity\u2019s chairman, and this week a judge cleared the way for the case to go forward.  In January, Tesla gave Mr. Musk a new compensation plan tied entirely to the company\u2019s market value and other performance goals. If he hits all of the goals, he could be rewarded with stock worth more than $50 billion.  But the company has repeatedly failed to meet its own targets and deadlines, especially with the Model 3. Mr. Musk originally predicted that the Model 3 would arrive in 2017 and that the car would push the company\u2019s sales to 500,000 cars a year by 2018. He later lowered his prediction to 100,000 Model 3s in 2017. Backtracking again, he said last August that the company hoped to make 20,000 a month by December, and added that \u201cpeople should have zero concerns\u201d about Tesla\u2019s ability to increase its output of the Model 3.  But in the fourth quarter of last year, Tesla made only 2,425 Model 3s. In its most recent plan, it hopes to lift production to 2,500 Model 3s a week. The company is expected to release first-quarter production totals in early April.  The Model 3 is crucial. The company needs to ramp up its Model 3 business to generate revenue so that it can pay back investors and fund development of future vehicles including its electric truck.  Moody\u2019s concluded that Tesla probably needed to raise more than $2 billion from investors to be able to finance its operations, continue capital investment and pay debts and other financial obligations that will come due soon. According to Moody\u2019s, Tesla has $200 million in convertible bonds due later this year, and $900 million due in early 2019.  \u201cLiquidity is going to be very tight by the end of the year,\u201d Bruce Clark, a senior vice president at Moody\u2019s, said in an interview. \u201cThey need to re-establish credibility with the capital markets.\u201d", "stock": "TSLA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-29", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/29/business/tesla-elon-musk.html"}, {"article": "Who is Jay Powell: Here\u2019s a refresher.

In fact, that entire governing philosophy of pushing the envelope frightens me a little. I would hope it would bother you as well.  And:  Writ large, I intend to exercise our statutory authority to enforce the laws of this nation. I intend to execute the statutory mandate of the Bureau to protect consumers. But we will no longer go beyond that mandate. If Congress wants us to do more than is set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act, they can change the law. Until then, we will enforce the law as currently written.  The context: Mr. Mulvaney, a longtime critic of the C.F.P.B., has been working to rein in the bureau, a longtime target of Republican ire.  \u2014 Michael J. de la Merced  Photo  Tension at the top of Airbnb  The home rental company\u2019s C.E.O., Brian Chesky, isn\u2019t always seeing eye to eye with his C.F.O., Laurence Tosi, according to an article in The Information.  In one instance, Mr. Chesky thought about starting an airline as Airbnb weighed a move into the air travel business. Mr. Tosi insisted on a lower-key approach of partnering with an existing app, according to the news site.  The context: Mr. Tosi was brought in from Blackstone to help professionalize one of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest unicorn darlings, much as Ruth Porat joined Alphabet from Morgan Stanley. That was more than likely to foster a clash between Silicon Valley idealism and Wall Street pragmatism.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  More from Cory Weinberg of The Information:  Mr. Tosi, who moved with his wife and two young children to the Bay Area for the Airbnb job, has tried to fit in, swapping Wall Street suits for jeans and vests. But his arrival also was a shock to Airbnb\u2019s culture, with its emphasis on an idealistic brand. Mr. Tosi sent marching orders across the company in 2016 that it had to get profitable. Before Airbnb could go public, it would have to have a better handle on predicting its earnings. \u201cI believe we have built this path but can do more,\u201d he wrote to employees. Mr. Tosi initiated cost-cutting efforts, including cuts to customer service and food staff, that longtime Airbnb employees saw as hurting the culture. But Airbnb\u2019s cost per customer service \u201cticket\u201d fell by 30% to 40% between 2016 and mid-2017 last year, an Airbnb official said, thanks largely to Mr. Tosi.  Why it matters: Airbnb is expected to pursue an I.P.O. as soon as next year. Which vision for the company will win out?  \u2014 Michael J. de la Merced  Was there fraud at KPMG?  The charges against five former employees of KPMG and a former government accountant show the lengths an accounting firm will go to get a good report from the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.  The indictment is a bit odd, though, because the defendants are accused of defrauding both the S.E.C. and the accounting board. They used confidential information to help deal with potential problems in KPMG\u2019s audits. But did getting a sneak peek at how they would be evaluated constitute theft, or just a form of cheating?  Fraud is a type of larceny, and normally the perpetrator obtains something from the victim, who suffers a loss. But in this case, the scheme was to help KPMG clean up its act to get a better grade in pending reviews.  In the world of white-collar crime, most fraud prosecutions involve at least some form of tangible gain to the defendants, and not a better report card. Courts have also required prosecutors to show there was at least some harm to the victim from the misuse of their property.  One way around this issue would be to charge a breach of the honest services statute, but that\u2019s not in the indictment. Nor did the Justice Department charged them under a law prohibiting the theft of government records. The S.E.C. did not accuse the accountants of securities fraud, only that they engaged in unethical or improper professional conduct.  A statement by Steven Peikin, the co-director of the S.E.C.\u2019s enforcement division, said that the defendants were \u201cliterally stealing the exam.\u201d I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s quite accurate, however, as it was more like learning when the teacher would give a pop quiz.  Is that a fraud?  \u2014 Peter J. Henning  What will Twitter do now that Anthony Noto has flown the coop?

Critics, and there are many, may regard it as yet another publicity stunt by the electric car marker, which has struggled to meet production targets for its Model 3.  But Mr. Musk and the head of the Tesla board\u2019s compensation committee said the arrangement would benefit shareholders, since it\u2019s directly linked to company performance.

(His calculations were based on the stock price at the beginning of this year, when the company was worth about $50 billion.)

Emergency personnel work at the scene where a Tesla vehicle crashed in Mountain View, Calif. on March 23. Tesla on Wednesday said the driver of the car was to blame, while his family said they were exploring legal options following the fatal accident. Photo: /Associated Press  Tesla Inc. TSLA 2.13% defended its semiautonomous Autopilot system in the wake of a fatal crash last month, blaming the incident on the driver after his family hired a lawyer to explore legal options.  Walter Huang died on March 23 after the Model X sport-utility vehicle he was driving southbound on Highway 101 near Mountain View, Calif., collided with a barrier and was struck by two other vehicles. The auto maker a week later said that the SUV\u2019s Autopilot was activated in the moments leading up to the crash and that the driver\u2019s hands weren\u2019t detected on the wheel for six seconds before the crash.  On Wednesday, Tesla more explicitly assigned blame to the driver. \u201cThe crash happened on a clear day with several hundred feet of visibility ahead, which means that the only way for this accident to have occurred is if Mr. Huang wasn\u2019t paying attention to the road, despite the car providing multiple warnings to do so,\u201d a Tesla spokesman said in a statement.  Earlier on Wednesday, San Francisco-based Minami Tamaki LLP announced in a statement that the family had retained its services and plans to file a wrongful-death lawsuit. The family appeared on local television on Tuesday night defending Mr. Huang\u2019s driving.  \u201cThe firm believes Tesla\u2019s Autopilot feature is defective and likely caused Huang\u2019s death, despite Tesla\u2019s apparent attempt to blame the victim of this terrible tragedy,\u201d the law firm said in a statement.  Investigators for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board are probing the crash. On April 1, the NTSB said it was unhappy with Tesla for releasing detailed information about the crash.  NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt and Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk had a recent discussion that appeared to defuse the tension. \u201cChairman Sumwalt had what he described as a very constructive conversation with Mr. Musk over the weekend,\u201d a spokesman for the NTSB said. \u201cThey discussed the investigation of the March 23 Tesla crash, NTSB investigative processes, and Tesla\u2019s work to address the safety recommendations that were issued last year as a result of the May 2016 Tesla crash in Williston, Florida.\u201d \u200bThe latter was a reference to a fatal crash involving Autopilot for which the NTSB determined Tesla shared blame.  Tesla declined to comment on the discussion.  The NTSB declined to comment\u200b on Tesla\u2019s defense of its technology in the most recent fatal crash, while NHTSA had no immediate comment.\u200bSeparately, the NTSB spokesman said the agency was investigating a battery fire linked to a Tesla Model X SUV that crashed into a garage in Lake Forest, Calif., in August 2017. The NTSB is primarily interested in the battery fire in that incident, the spokesman said. Tesla declined to comment on the battery-fire probe.  Tesla\u2019s Wednesday statement intensified its defense of semiautonomous technology amid greater scrutiny of whether humans can remain alert while using these systems. Auto makers are rolling out partially automated systems that pass control back and forth between vehicle and driver, some with technology designed to keep the driver alert, such as eye-tracking technology. Others, like Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Waymo, believe there should be no need for a human to take control in driving situations.  Autopilot, which is a collection of \u201cdriver assistance features,\u201d isn\u2019t a self-driving system. Tesla tells users in its owner\u2019s manual and in-vehicle display warnings that users need to remain alert and maintain control of the vehicle.  \u201cWe empathize with Mr. Huang\u2019s family, who are understandably facing loss and grief, but the false impression that Autopilot is unsafe will cause harm to others on the road,\u201d Tesla said Wednesday. \u201cThe reason that other families are not on TV is because their loved ones are still alive.\u201d  Tesla had said earlier that the driver took no action despite having five seconds and about 500 feet of unobstructed view of the concrete highway divider.  The 2016 fatal crash in Florida put Tesla\u2019s technology into the spotlight. The NTSB said Tesla shared partial blame for the crash, noting Autopilot allowed the driver to go long periods without his hands on the wheel and ignore the company\u2019s warnings. NHTSA, however, said the system wasn\u2019t defective and that Tesla vehicles\u2019 crash rate dropped by almost 40% after the auto-steer feature was installed. The vehicle in the 2016 accident was equipped with the auto-steer feature.  After the NTSB findings in the 2016 crash, Tesla said it would continue to be clear with current and potential customers that Autopilot doesn\u2019t render vehicles fully self-driving and that motorists must always remain attentive.

I will leave to others the implications for democracy when a U.S. president singles out a company that he wants to punish, but from a business point of view, his crusade is nuts. For all of Trump's huffing and puffing, there is little he can do to inflict pain on Amazon and its chief executive, Jeff Bezos. It's amazing that he can't see it.  The president complains that Amazon doesn't pay taxes. For the most part, that hasn't been true; between 2007 and 2015, it paid a combined tax rate (for federal, state, local and foreign) of 13 percent, on par with many big companies. Last year, however, it did not pay any federal taxes. Why? It appears that Amazon was able to take advantage of some provisions in Trump's pride and joy, the tax cut he signed in December. In addition, while Amazon for years fought efforts to force it to collect state and local sales tax, it has begun doing so, even collecting from its third-party vendors. Besides, there is simply no way Trump can target one company for a different tax treatment than other companies. So much for taxes.  According to the news site Axios, Trump has mused about using antitrust law to whack Amazon. In fact, there are many people who believe that big tech companies like Amazon, Facebook and Google deserve far more antitrust scrutiny than they've gotten, and indeed, that antitrust policy needs to better reflect their enormous power. I'm one of them.  But singling out Amazon is no way to go about it. It causes antitrust experts to shrink from the subject because they don't want to be seen as doing Trump's dirty work. And it puts the Justice Department's antitrust division in a terrible spot. Having already sued to stop AT&T from buying Time Warner after Trump complained about the deal, the division's leaders would look like lackeys if they went after Amazon, too. Indeed, given the current state of antitrust law, which is very forgiving of big companies making big acquisitions, there is nothing for the government to go after Amazon for.  It's possible, I suppose, that Trump could prevent Amazon from getting government contracts. In 2013, the company successfully brought cloud computing to the Central Intelligence Agency, and it is the current front-runner for a 10-year, multi-billion-dollar cloud computing contract with the Pentagon. Other tech companies are lobbying to get a piece of the contract, and perhaps the Defense Department will conclude that it's not worth inviting the president's ire to give it to the company with the most experience and biggest market share. Fear not. Amazon had over $177 billion in revenue last year and is on track to easily top $200 billion in 2018. If it never sees another penny from the government, it will do just fine.  Finally, there is the relationship that Trump has complained about most frequently: Amazon's business with the U.S. Postal Service:  I am right about Amazon costing the United States Post Office massive amounts of money for being their Delivery Boy. Amazon should pay these costs (plus) and not have them bourne by the American Taxpayer. Many billions of dollars. P.O. leaders don\u00e2t have a clue (or do they?)! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 3, 2018  Back in 2012, the Postal Service was in deep trouble. A self-financed agency since the 1980s, it had lost $25 billion over the previous six years, and $6.5 billion in just the first six months of the year. It had three big problems. First, even though it was expected to generate its own revenue, Congress made it hard to do things that could save billions, like closing rural post offices or ending Saturday delivery. Second, Congress imposed a bizarre requirement that it pre-fund retiree health-care premiums to the tune of $5.5 billion a year. And third, fewer and fewer people were sending first-class mail.  The decline in first-class mail continues today. But postal revenue has largely stabilized at around $70 billion, and losses in 2017 were down to $2.7 billion. Why? Because despite the congressional impediments, the Postal Service has done some serious cost-cutting. Also, its package-delivery business is going gangbusters. This is almost entirely thanks to Amazon, which has started to rely on the Postal Service to get packages to customers' front doors.  QuickTake Q&A: Amazon and the Post Office  Although the terms of Amazon's postal contract have never been revealed, it is implausible that the deal costs the post office money, as Trump claims. What's more, if he thinks Amazon is getting too sweet a deal, he is actually in a position to do something about it. The Postal Service's overseer, its Board of Governors, is supposed to comprise 11 people. It currently has two: Megan Brennan, the Postmaster General, and her deputy, Ronald Stroman. Every other seat is empty.  Trump has nominated three people for the board, but even if all three were approved by the Senate, the board would still lack a quorum. And without a quorum, it can't do things like, well, renegotiate big contracts. It would be easy enough for Trump to find nominees who would vow to force Amazon to pay more. But to do that, he'd have to be paying attention to his job.  Trump's real motivation is doubtless to get back at Bezos for his ownership of the Washington Post, which regularly publishes unflattering revelations about his presidency and business life. But he really should have thought twice before going after Amazon and its CEO..  There may be some chief executives who would be rattled by attacks from the president. Bezos is not one of them. You'll notice that so far he hasn't responded to Trump's tweets, and he won't. He's too smart for that. And while Trump has managed to hurt Amazon's valuation, you would be hard-pressed to find a CEO who spends less time worrying about his company's share price than Bezos. Eventually, the market will realize that Trump's threats are toothless, and the stock will come back up again.  There is a final reason why Trump's attacks on Amazon are so misguided. If he could put aside his venom for Bezos, he might be able to see that Amazon is a company that's doing exactly what he says he wants American companies to do. It's creating jobs, not just tech jobs in Seattle but blue-collar jobs in the warehouses it has built around the country. It pays most of the tuition when workers want to learn skills that will lead to better jobs. It's in the process of choosing a second headquarters city where it will eventually employ up to 50,000 workers. It's getting into health care in an effort to bring down costs. It treats customers better than any other tech company. Oh, and its chief competitor isn't an American company but a Chinese one, Alibaba.  So go after Amazon if you insist, Mr. President. But if you keep it up, this is one crusade you may live to regret.

And their parents. And most of their grandparents.  But one group of potential customers has eluded the world\u2019s biggest Internet retailer.  Teenagers, otherwise known as Generation Z, with their lack of debit and credit cards, their absence of bank accounts and their overwhelming preference for actually putting on clothes and going to physical stores to buy things they could purchase online, pose a big challenge to Amazon.  Amazon\u2019s answer: The internet behemoth is in early discussions with banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Capital One Financial Corp. to create a product similar to checking accounts, according to people familiar with the matter who requested anonymity. Amazon aims to tailor the accounts to appeal especially to youngsters and those who own no plastic in their wallets, the people said.  Debit Devotees Consumers between the ages of 18-24 prefer debit cards to other forms of payments Source: Total System Services Inc.  \u201cThe sooner you can start collecting information on them, the better prepared you are,\u201d said Tim Barefield, a managing director at the consulting firm Kotter International. \u201cFor Amazon, it\u2019s another way to expand their brand. Their brand is reaching out every place that their tentacles can reach out to.\u201d  The move shows Amazon\u2019s recognition that digital accounts for minors potentially lock in lifetime customers before they even leave their parents\u2019 house. Amazon is savvy about its users\u2019 life cycles. It offers new parents discounts on diapers and baby food. It gives college students discounted Amazon Prime memberships, providing free shipping and access to streaming video so young adults will already be Amazon shoppers when they start making more of their own spending decisions.  Pseudo Card  Since many young people don\u2019t qualify for credit cards, Amazon created a pseudo-debit card called Amazon Cash that lets teenagers drop off money at drugstores such as 7-Eleven Inc. and CVS Health Corp. and add it to an Amazon wallet they can use online.  But Amazon has long known the process is clunky and has wanted to take steps to make it easier for customers without bank accounts to shop on its website. Walmart Inc. and American Express Co. offer accounts called Bluebird that have made inroads with teens.  Amazon, led by billionaire Jeff Bezos, is trying to stay on top even as it had revenue of $178 billion last year, a 31 percent jump from 2016 and an almost 2,500 percent increase from 2004, when many of these potential new customers were born.  Service Charges  Children under the age of 18 typically aren\u2019t able to sign up for a bank account without parental consent. Checking accounts for high school students often come with monthly service charges and overdraft fees.  So there\u2019s a chance for Amazon to improve the banking experience, said Stuart Sopp, chief executive officer of Current, a startup that offers debit cards to teens.  \u201cI\u2019m sure Amazon is scaring the hell out of every single regional bank and credit union right now,\u201d Sopp said. \u201cThe banks have very clearly not serviced these demographics, so there\u2019s opportunity.\u201d  Check Yes Consumers said they were open to banking with Amazon, even if it came with a fee Source: Cornerstone Advisors, StrategyCorps  If Amazon could deliver a better banking experience for digitally savvy youngsters who are used to getting what they want with a few swipes or clicks, they might have banking customers for a long time, said Eric Marks, a senior director at the financial consultancy West Monroe Partners.  Amazon might also entice teens with its personal assistant Alexa. Such devices are popular among teens looking for a convenient way to pay, said Gavin Rosenberg, a senior director at the payments processor Total System Services Inc.  \u201cThe younger generations are less concerned about privacy, so they\u2019re more apt to use them,\u201d Rosenberg said.  Adults, Too  The marketing opportunity doesn\u2019t end with teenagers. The e-commerce giant could also end up persuading people to close their existing bank accounts and open a new one with Amazon, according to a Cornerstone Advisors study published in January. It would also be a chance for a bank to partner with the online gargantuan.  \u201cRight now, banks might not be offering exactly what millennials want or need,\u201d said Marielle Schurig, a financial adviser at UBS Group AG who works with high-net-worth millennials. \u201cA lot of monthly statements don\u2019t offer insights or tools to manage your records or analyze your spending to budget or save for the future\u201d -- something Amazon might provide.  Even with as much as a $10 monthly fee, 27 percent of young millennials polled said they would open an additional checking account with Amazon. One-tenth said they would close their existing account and go with Amazon.  \u201cThis is music to Amazon\u2019s ears,\u201d Cornerstone said in its report. \u201cWhy would they want to offer a free checking account when they can bundle the services of various providers on their platform -- merchants and financial services providers -- and charge a fee for it.

From 2013 to 2016, the USPS averaged a net loss of $5.3 billion per year. The reasons behind those losses, though, are more complicated than the way Trump seems to see it. According to the president, the financial woes of the Postal Service have much to do with the deal it has with Amazon.com to deliver the internet retailer\u2019s packages.  Leaving aside Trump\u2019s claims about the Postal Service\u2019s deal with Amazon (which is not a money loser) and his probable reasons for treating it like a pi\u00f1ata (he\u2019s no fan of Amazon Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos, who also happens to be the owner of the Washington Post, a leading chronicler of this administration\u2019s foibles) the president is right to be concerned with the state of the USPS. The question is whether Trump actually wants to fix the agency or simply tweet about it. If he wants to fix it, there are a number of things he could do.  For starters, he could support a group of U.S. senators with a set of postal reform proposals that could return the agency to solvency. In late March, Senator Tom Carper (D-Del.), introduced a bill with a bipartisan co-sponsorship that would move retired postal workers into Medicare, eliminating the agency\u2019s unfunded health-care liabilities and its need to set aside huge sums to cover them. Naturally, some congressional deficit hawks have complained that this would just shift these costs from one side of the federal ledger to the other. Yet the USPS, the second-largest contributor to Medicare after the federal government, has said such a plan would only raise the government\u2019s annual Medicare costs by a 10th of 1 percent.  Ten Years of Losses Net loss, U.S. Postal Service Data: USPS; graphic by Bloomberg Businessweek  The Senate bill, introduced March 22, would also restore half of the 4.3 percent emergency rate increase on items like first-class mail that the Postal Regulatory Commission granted the agency in 2013 only to revoke it three years later. It didn\u2019t matter that first-class mail continued its inexorable decline as more people used email and pay their bills online. The result was a decline in American stamp prices, already among the lowest in the developed world, from 49 cents to 47 cents, which only added to the losses at the USPS.  These are worthy ideas, endorsed with rare unanimity by USPS management, postal worker unions, and many of the institution\u2019s largest customers. Without White House support, however, the Senate bill is likely to wither and die, a fate suffered by other promising reform proposals in recent years. The tragedy isn\u2019t that Trump has yet to express any interest in pushing such ideas, it\u2019s that he appears not to understand how the agency actually functions.  As reported by Bloomberg News, Trump expressed a desire to aides last summer to raise the Postal Service\u2019s rates for delivering Amazon packages. According to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity, Trump\u2019s staff explained to him that the Postal Service is an independent organization and its mail rates are set by a commission.  American presidents have a history of getting involved in matters postal, usually for the better. In 1792, George Washington signed the country\u2019s first postal act, which included lower rates for newspapers in an effort to create an informed citizenry. It was so effective that French political philosopher Alexis De Tocqueville praised the American postal system as \u201cthe great link between minds\u201d when he visited the country in 1831. Trump\u2019s idol Andrew Jackson was so enamored with the Postal Service that he moved it into the president\u2019s cabinet after he was elected in 1828 and stuffed it with his political supporters, a practice that continued for more than a century.  Montgomery Blair, Abraham Lincoln\u2019s postmaster general, introduced free home delivery in cities at a time when most people had to endure long lines at the post office to get their letters. Under Woodrow Wilson, the Postal Service introduced airmail in 1918, clearing the runway for the commercial aviation industry. Richard Nixon signed a bill in 1970 removing the USPS from the president\u2019s cabinet in an effort to remove it from the political hurly-burly and give it the nimbleness of a private company. Unfortunately, it was still subject to heavy-handed congressional and regulatory oversight and often struggled to break even.  In 2006, President George W. Bush signed a bill giving the USPS long overdue power to negotiate package shipping deals like the Amazon one. Unfortunately, the bill required the USPS to set aside $5 billion a year to prefund the health benefits of its future retirees. It wasn\u2019t long before the Great Recession arrived, causing mail volume to plummet.  Decline in Volume of All Mail Number of pieces Data: USPS; graphic by Bloomberg Businessweek  The financial burdens that the Bush administration imposed were clearly untenable. Yet Bush\u2019s successor Barack Obama did virtually nothing to alleviate the situation. During his 2008 presidential campaign, Obama quipped, \u201cUPS and FedEx are doing fine. It\u2019s the post office that\u2019s always having problems.\u201d Postal workers understandably took issue with his remark. Once Obama was in the White House, his administration quietly supported the USPS\u2019s plan to end Saturday delivery, which would have saved $2 billion a year. It died in Congress because it was vociferously opposed by postal workers unions and congressional representatives from rural areas who said their constituents depended on traditional mail delivery. Meanwhile, the USPS\u2019s losses mounted, and it was forced to cut hours at rural post offices and slow first-class mail delivery in a vain attempt to make ends meet.  Presidents no longer have the control over the Postal Service that they did in Jackson or Wilson\u2019s day. Today, they get to appoint its board of governors. That\u2019s about it for their formal powers, but they can use the bully pulpit to push for change. That\u2019s what Trump is attempting to do now on Twitter in his criticisms of Amazon and the USPS. The problem is that he\u2019s focused on the wrong issues. He returned to Twitter on April 2, recycling an argument made last year by Citigroup analysts who argued that, properly accounted for, the USPS was losing an average of $1.50 on every Amazon package.  It\u2019s a complicated, legalistic case based on the presumption that the USPS, which declines to disclose the agreement\u2019s terms, is essentially providing Amazon a free ride on its letter delivery network rather than requiring it to pay the full costs of the service. That notion excites people at UPS and FedEx and their investors, but few others seem to take it seriously. (The conservative Wall Street Journal editorial page, a frequent critic of the USPS, shrugged it off on Tuesday.)  The reality is that the USPS needs more customers like Amazon, not fewer. It\u2019s required by law to visit every address in the country six days a week regardless of how many bills, greeting cards, and catalogs its letter carriers lug in their sacks. With first-class mail and the junkier kind disappearing, the USPS needs something else to put through the network to make money. Postal workers have a saying: \u201cThe internet giveth, and the internet taketh away,\u201d which is to say the agency\u2019s future lies in online shopping. Amazon is the first retailer to integrate its distribution system into the Postal Service\u2019s network, constructing sorting centers around the country to funnel packages to local post offices so letter carriers can tote them to people\u2019s doors. As e-commerce continues to account for more of what Americans spend, it provides a potential path to a healthier financial future for the USPS.  This vision of the agency\u2019s future is something a shrewd president might champion, but it would require Trump to stop making dubious claims about the reasons for the Postal Service\u2019s financial difficulties. He might even admit that he\u2019s been wrong about the Amazon deal. Unfortunately, that\u2019s not Trump\u2019s style.

Amid President Donald Trump's ongoing public feud with Amazon, CNBC reports that the e-commerce behemoth has been fighting with UPS for the past few years.  The argument seems to be over the United States Postal Service's (USPS) cost structure, which has a direct impact on Amazon, its largest and most highly publicized customer, as well as UPS, which has struggled to lower its prices to match USPS' rates. Amazon's relationship with USPS directly affects the competitive landscape of parcel deliveries in the US, a market in which UPS and FedEx are the dominant players.  The dispute stems from how USPS splits up its fixed costs \u2014 including driver salaries, trucking fees, and other overhead expenses \u2014 between its two business segments. The two units are its letter business, a government-protected monopoly, and the competitive parcel business, which competes with UPS, FedEx, and other parcel delivery companies.  Under the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006, USPS is currently required to cover at least 5.5% of its fixed costs with revenue from its competitive business. Competing logistics providers, however, argue that this low-cost coverage requirement is outdated because of the explosive growth in e-commerce over the last few years \u2014 the competitive business now accounts for 30% of USPS' total revenue, up from only 11% a decade ago.  Last year, UPS argued in a filing with the Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC) that the law gave the postal service an unfair competitive advantage. That's because USPS can cover a large portion of its costs with its letter business, and therefore offer lower prices than other logistics companies.  Amazon routes the majority of its deliveries through USPS as a result of these lower rates, meaning UPS and other logistics providers are losing out on a plethora of business. Moreover, the e-tailer has argued for keeping the requirement as is, saying that a higher minimum would provide no benefits to stakeholders and isn't necessary to create a level playing field. UPS argued in its filing that the postal service's competitive business should cover a much larger share of its fixed costs, somewhere around 29%.  Tensions between the e-commerce titan and logistics companies will only intensify as Amazon moves further into the logistics market over the next few years.Amazon's well-publicized ambitions in the logistics space have grown more intense over the last few months, and will likely only continue to become more serious. It launched Fulfillment by Amazon, which allows third-party sellers to store and ship some of their products in the online retailer's proprietary logistics network, way back in 2006, and it now serves millions of retailers around the world.  Last year, the company started trialing Seller Flex in several locations on the West Coast, which took over management of its third-party sellers' deliveries to speed up delivery times and lower costs, and last month, The Wall Street Journal reported that the company is preparing to launch a stand-alone shipping service for any retailer. Amazon still has a long way to go before it even comes close to posing a direct threat to UPS, FedEx, and DHL, but as it continues to make inroads into the logistics space, it's likely that the company will only further inflame these existing tensions.", "stock": "AMZN", "label": 1, "date": "2018-04-09", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-and-ups-were-feuding-before-trump-2018-4"}, {"article": "BII  This story was delivered to BI Intelligence IoT Briefing subscribers hours before it appeared on Business Insider.

Amazon's Alexa fund recently participated in a $62 million Series C funding round into 11-year-old smart home device manufacturer Ecobee, according to CNBC. The funding round was led by Energy Impact Partners.  The Toronto-based company primarily makes smart thermostats, but also sells sensor packages that can pair with the thermostats to help users manage hot and cold spots in their homes, and recently announced it will soon sell smart light switches. The Alexa fund, which Amazon launched back in late 2015, invests in third-party hardware companies and help them make their devices compatible with Alexa, or, in some cases, embed Alexa into their devices.  The Alexa fund was also one of the lead investors in the Series B round Ecobee completed back in 2016, and last year the device maker introduced a new thermostat that has Alexa embedded in it. This latest funding round brings the Ecobee's total funding to $146 million. Thomvest and Relay Ventures, two US-based venture firms, joined Amazon in leading the investment.  Amazon's investment comes shortly after it purchased video doorbell makers Ring and Blink, and considered buying smart lock maker August. The e-commerce titan is clearly interested in broadening its footprint in the smart home market, and likely hopes to leverage the immense popularity of its Echo smart speakers to get its users to purchase devices from companies it has acquired or invested in.  Its ongoing support of Ecobee suggests that the company is at least exploring the idea of adding smart thermostats, sensors, and light switches to its own product suite, which would allow it to build a more complete smart home ecosystem around the Echo products.  Ecobee's primary competitor in the smart thermostat space is Alphabet-owned Nest, and given that Amazon decided to stop selling Nest products through its marketplace last week, it will likely target Ecobee's devices at customers on its e-commerce site who otherwise might have purchased Nest products. Amazon may eventually look to purchase Ecobee outright the way it did with Blink and Ring, though it's unclear whether the younger firm is looking to sell.  Amazon, however, still faces an uphill battle in a fragmented market long plagued by slow growth. The company likely hopes that it can convince its loyalists and other mass-market consumers to buy smart home devices, ultimately growing the overall market. But the consumer IoT space has seen slow adoption, and many companies are struggling to turn a profit.  Meanwhile, Amazon will need to confront a fragmented market with legacy home device makers like GE and Honeywell, as well as Nest, which now has its own long line of smart home devices along with its flagship thermostats.  Amazon may struggle to turn a profit in this difficult market, but the company takes heavy losses in many other business segments, and likely finds the data it could collect on consumers' habits through its smart home devices an enticing incentive to compete. That data could be valuable for its core e-commerce business, as well as new initiatives like its recently reported package delivery service.  The US smart home market has still yet to meet the expectations many observers had in the early part of this decade.  The same issues BI Intelligence first identified back in 2015 still plague the space \u2014 persistently high prices, technological fragmentation, and consumers' lack of a perceived benefit from the devices.  But the newfound popularity of smart home voice control has revolutionized smart home ecosystems across the country, and convinces more consumers to equip their homes with smart devices on a daily basis. The Amazon Echo, released in 2014, has become immensely popular and capable, awakening users to the utility of both voice control and smart home devices. This has prompted companies to rush to release competing devices and integrate voice control into their smart home ecosystems.

How it works  Thousands of brands large and small, selling through Amazon\u2019s Marketplace seller program, are now what drives Amazon\u2019s rapid growth in ad revenue. Jijamas, founded in 2013, wouldn\u2019t exist without Amazon, says Gustavo Sanchez, the brand\u2019s co-founder and chief executive. Jijamas sells one thing: Supersoft, high-end women\u2019s pajamas.  Starting at about $70 a set, they rarely turn up near the top of search results for \u201cpajamas\u201d on Amazon, says Mr. Sanchez, since the site\u2019s algorithm favors cheaper, higher-volume goods. Even its high customer ratings only help Jijamas get so far.  The company\u2019s revenue growth is dependent on Amazon advertising, Mr. Sanchez says.  Advertising on Amazon is much like advertising on Google\u2019s AdWords platform, says Daniel Knijnik, chief executive of Quartile, a small ad agency started last August that focuses solely on Amazon. Most ads appear atop search results for various keywords.  Jijamas, a specialty line of high-end pajamas, depends on Amazon for virtually all its revenue growth. Shown, Gustavo Sanchez, the brand\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, on January 26 in New York City. Photo: Kenneth Bachor/The Wall Street Journal  Advertising plays an important role in Amazon\u2019s lucrative direct-to-consumer marketplace, where Amazon, at added cost, provides warehousing and shipping to third-party sellers. Because advertising allows brands to connect better with Amazon\u2019s shoppers, Mr. Knijnik says, even manufacturers who previously sold wholesale to Amazon are now opening their own \u201cstores\u201d on the site.  For sellers like Mr. Sanchez, advertising on Amazon is a mixed bag. A \u201csponsored\u201d listing is essential for getting products to the top of search results, which is the only surefire way to sell anything on a site that offers millions of different products. But sponsored lists are also another way Amazon skims off his profits.  Amazon wants to deliver everything you want to your doorstep, anywhere in the world. But the e-commerce giant faces several challenges in its pursuit of a global empire. WSJ's Karan Deep Singh breaks down the basics with the help of an Amazon delivery box.  On top of the 15% of an item\u2019s selling price that Mr. Sanchez pays just to list Jijamas on Amazon\u2019s marketplace, and the 5% to 6% he pays to have Amazon warehouse and ship his products, there is now up to 12% going to advertising for every item sold through an ad. This April, Amazon will start charging an additional 2% to list apparel (it hasn\u2019t disclosed why). The net result is that Amazon will take about 35% of the price of each pair of Jijamas sold through its sponsored listings.  If Amazon decides to change its search result ranking algorithms or hike its ad fees, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing I can do about it,\u201d Mr. Sanchez says. Amazon represents 65% of his total sales, he adds; the remainder comes from his own website.  Where it can grow  Amazon is continually building and buying new sources of data on our tastes and consumer behavior, from its acquisition of Whole Foods and the build-out of its cashierless Amazon Go stores to the invasion of its low-cost, voice-powered speakers and the rapid increase in its library of streaming video.  Every time Amazon racks up another percentage point of the $5 trillion U.S. retail pie, another $50 billion in the kind of data that Google and Facebook relied on disappears from their systems. Plus, Amazon understands shoppers in a way Google and Facebook might not.  \u201cAmazon doesn\u2019t just know what you buy, they also know about how you shop,\u201d says Diana Gordon, director of Shop+, the ecommerce-focused arm of WPP-owned ad firm Mindshare. \u201cThey know your browsing behavior, the cadence with which you restock certain types of consumables,\u201d she adds.  Amazon is building out not only its self-service ad business but also the sales team devoted to getting brands on board.  All of this could give Amazon an edge over Google and Facebook, but for it to scale that business, it will have to look beyond ads targeted at consumers who are already shopping on its sites.  For that, Amazon has a web-spanning advertising network just like Google\u2019s and Facebook\u2019s\u2014which is the reason a vacuum cleaner you once almost bought can haunt you for weeks on random websites. The Amazon Advertising Platform lets advertisers manage ad buys across multiple advertising exchanges, and it has quietly become as familiar to marketers as its equivalent from Google-owned DoubleClick.  Amazon is building out not only its self-service ad business but also the sales team charged with getting more brands on board. Shown, Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos in May. Photo: April Greer/The Washington Post/Getty Images  Amazon also needs to expand the number of places it can sell advertisements, which is one reason the company bought videogame-streaming behemoth Twitch and is investing so heavily in its own streaming-video offerings.  The company has been creative about where it places ads\u2014ever notice a movie ad on the side of an Amazon box shipped to your house?

AMZN -1.22% is scheduled to announce its fourth-quarter earnings after the market closes Thursday. Here\u2019s what you need to know:  EARNINGS FORECAST: Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Amazon to earn $1.85 a share, compared with $1.54 a year ago. The company has forecast an operating income range between $300 million and $1.65 billion, compared with income of $1.26 billion a year ago.  REVENUE FORECAST: Quarterly revenue of $59.83 billion is forecast by the analysts, compared with $43.74 billion a year ago. Amazon said it expected sales of between $56 billion and $60.5 billion for the quarter, which includes growth from its acquisition of Whole Foods.  WHAT TO WATCH:  \u2014HOLIDAYS: Amazon lately has been demonstrating a little more fiscal discipline, something that may pay off with record profitability in its all-important fourth quarter. Already, industry numbers are indicating a positive holiday season for retailers as consumers spent more, something that should benefit Amazon, which has a 40%-plus share of online shopping.  \u2014WHOLE FOODS: Amazon acquired Whole Foods in August, and the fourth quarter is the first full quarter of reporting. Amazon has so far added lockers for package pickups and lowered prices. Analysts will expect some evidence of whether it is paying off. For roughly one month in the third quarter, the grocery chain contributed about $1.28 billion in sales and $21 million in operating income.  \u2014HQ2: Executives may provide an update on its search for a second headquarters. The company earlier this month narrowed its list to 20 from 238. The stakes are high: Amazon has said it plans to create about 50,000 jobs and invest $5 billion over nearly 20 years.  \u2014HEALTH CARE: Amazon on Tuesday said it was joining JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. to form a new company focusing on lowering U.S. health-care costs. The companies hope the entire health-care project could at a minimum save them hundreds of millions of dollars, according to a person familiar with the matter. Amazon has more than 300,000 employees in the U.S. after adding Whole Foods, and those benefits are costly. Expect analysts to ask for more clarity on potential cost savings.

The indefatigable CEO stopped appearing personally on Amazon\u2019s quarterly earnings calls years ago, but he had a clear message for investors Thursday when the online retail giant posted record earnings along with a 38% jump in sales for the fourth quarter. Writing of the strong success of his company\u2019s voice-activated digital assistant technology called Alexa, Mr. Bezos noted in the company\u2019s release: \u201cWe don\u2019t see positive surprises of this magnitude very often\u2014expect us to double down.\u201d  It is unlikely that he means just more speakers. Amazon has long been sharply focused on driving growth with little urgency to boost profits. It has been richly rewarded by investors for doing so. Amazon\u2019s market value soared 56% last year, beating all of its Big Tech peers despite their much fatter bottom lines. For example, Facebook generated about 50 cents in operating earnings for every dollar of revenue in 2017; Amazon generated 2.3 cents by the same measure.  It is worth noting that Mr. Bezos\u2019s biggest gambles actually take a while to pay off. It was 13 years ago today that he first announced Amazon Prime, a membership-based shipping service. At the time, it seemed improbable that many people would pay $79 a year to get \u201cHarry Potter\u201d books rushed to their doorstep. But Prime has since become a must-have for more than 90 million members in the U.S. alone, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. It now generates more than $9 billion in subscription fee revenue per year for Amazon and effectively locks in Amazon as the first choice in shopping destinations for its paying members.  It isn\u2019t cheap to maintain, though. Amazon has since sweetened Prime with services like video and music on demand, putting the company into the business of creating new content to keep attracting users.  There seems to be no limit to where Amazon will eventually spread. The company became a major grocer last year with its acquisition of Whole Foods Market and even has been making rumblings about getting into health care of late. The company even noted the contribution of revenue from its budding advertising business on Thursday.  Mr. Bezos\u2019s ambitions have helped make Amazon the world\u2019s fourth most valuable company and himself the world\u2019s wealthiest person. His third decade at the helm has brought no signs of slowing down. Once-skeptical investors may dread the day he does.  Amazon wants to deliver everything you want to your doorstep, anywhere in the world. But the e-commerce giant faces several challenges in its pursuit of a global empire.

While the company has remained quiet about its plans, some analysts noted that companies often use their own employees as a testing ground for future initiatives.  The entry of Amazon and its partners adds to the upheaval in an industry where much is changing, from government programs after the overhaul of the tax law to the uncertain future of the Affordable Care Act. All the while, medical costs have persistently been on the rise.

In a regulatory filing detailing its U.S.-listed stock holdings as of Dec. 31, Berkshire reported owning about 18.9 million Teva American depositary receipts, worth about $358 million.  Teva shares rose more than 10 percent after market hours, reflecting what investors perceive as Berkshire\u2019s seal of approval for the Israeli drugmaker.

Chinese universities and U.S. technology companies, such as International Business Machines Corp. and Microsoft Corp., are racing to develop quantum computers, a type of processing that\u2019s forecast to be so powerful it can transform how drug-makers, agriculture companies and auto manufacturers discover compounds and materials.  Quantum computing uses the movement of subatomic particles to process data in amounts that modern computers can\u2019t handle. Mostly theoretical now, the technology is expected to be able to perform calculations that make today\u2019s computers look akin to an abacus.  While overall spending by China is unknown, its government is building a $10 billion National Laboratory for Quantum Information Sciences in Hefei, Anhui Province, which is slated to open in 2020. U.S.-funded research in quantum is about $200 million a year, according to a July 2016 government report, and some researchers and companies don\u2019t believe that\u2019s enough.  Quantifying Quantum Computing U.S. and Chinese are in an arms race to patent innovations in computing's next wave Source: Patinformatics  One \u201ckiller app\u201d may be encryption, the code scrambling technology that secures modern global commerce and communications. China, Chinese universities and western financial institutions are rushing to patent more ways to use quantum technology for encryption, a study by research firm Patinformatics found.  \u2018Unhackable System\u2019  \u201cWe\u2019re talking about encrypting data so it can\u2019t be broken, certainly not by a classical computer,\u201d said Tony Trippe, managing director of Dublin, Ohio-based Patinformatics. \u201cIt would be an unhackable system.\u201d  At the same time, it could break encryption that was on a classical computer. \u201cAn organization or a nation that had quantum computer technologies would have a significantly easier time of wreaking havoc on other systems,\u201d he said.  What\u2019s Intellectual Property and Does China Steal It?: QuickTake  U.S. President Donald Trump accused the Chinese government in March of stealing intellectual property by forcing American companies to share their most valuable secrets and sign joint venture agreements with local firms if they want to operate in China, although there are no specific allegations regarding quantum computers.  Peter Navarro, the White House trade adviser, spoke Sunday on NBC\u2019s \"Meet the Press\" about the tariffs before shifting to intellectual property.  \"What is at stake here,\" he said, \"is the industries of the future. Artificial intelligence, robotics, quantum computing. And what\u2019s at stake is not just our economic prosperity. If I may, it\u2019s also our national security. Because many of these industries of the future have profound military implications.\"  China\u2019s Innovation  China has also been aggressive in pushing home-grown innovation as it supports companies in obtaining patents and trademarks around the world, and has increased its research funding. In its annual scorecard, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development called China \u201cthe second largest scientific powerhouse,\u201d behind the U.S.  Read More: Who Is Building Canada\u2019s Quantum Brain Trust?  Technology companies from Microsoft to IBM to Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google view quantum computing as the next revolution.  \u201cOver time, quantum in the field of computation is so important is that it will redefine the category of computers themselves,\u201d said Dario Gil, vice president of IBM\u2019s Artificial Intelligence research. \u201cIt is the future of computing.\u201d  IBM\u2019s inventions may be having the most impact on the nascent field, when judged by the number of times its research has been cited by others in their patent applications. The Armonk, New York-based company already has developed computers being tested by customers, including Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, the Energy Department\u2019s biggest lab, as well as finance companies like JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Barclays Plc, Gil said.  \u2018Tough Problems\u2019  Intel Corp., which started its own program two years ago, said the technology promises to be \u201ctransformational.\u201d  \u201cThere are many tough problems to solve before quantum computing is a commercial reality,\u201d said Jim Clarke, director of quantum hardware at Intel. \u201cSome of these problems involve materials science, quantum chip design and manufacturing -- those are sweet-spot problems for Intel.\u201d  Clarke said Intel is competitive in the number of patents it\u2019s seeking, though many aren\u2019t yet public. Applications are made public after 18 months.  IBM Makes Breakthrough in Race to Commercialize Quantum Computers  While there will still be a place for what\u2019s being called \u201cclassical computers\u201d -- a category that includes modern smartphones and even super computers -- the quantum computers could have \u201can infinite number of applications\u201d in the fields of life sciences, chemistry and agriculture, said IBM\u2019s Gil.  \u2018Patent the Potential\u2019  It\u2019s too early to say which company or country will be the leader in quantum computers, though at this stage it looks like U.S. companies will excel in hardware while Chinese and Japanese ones are focused on the software and applications, Patinformatics\u2019 Trippe said.  \u201cJapanese and Chinese companies aren\u2019t as concerned about building them as they are about how they\u2019ll be used,\u201d Trippe said. \u201cThey\u2019ve started to patent the potential. The next five years are going to be pretty fascinating.\u201d  The U.S. China Economic and Security Review Commission, created by Congress in 2000 to assess national security implications of bilateral trade between the countries, said in its most recent report that China \u201chas closed the technological gap\u201d with the U.S. in quantum information science, a sector Americans have long dominated, \u201cdue to a concerted strategy by the Chinese government and inconsistent and unstable levels of R&D funding and limited government coordination by the United States.\u201d  Quantum Physics  Studies by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Bloomberg have independently shown that China is rising in its overall score for innovation, which includes education, government research and the number of patents. The World Intellectual Property Organization reported March 21 that China is closing in on the U.S. in filing international patent applications.  Quantum physics is one area in which the Chinese government, through its Ministry of Science and Technology, is beefing up its technological prowess, according to a report by the U.S. Trade Representative that laid the groundwork for Trump\u2019s tariff plans. The China Academy of Sciences and Beijing University are among the Chinese research firms seeking more patents on quantum information technology, according to Patinformatics.  The Chinese government invested by giving a lot of money to companies and researchers to \u201creplicate what we did in the U.S. and elsewhere,\u201d said Carl J. Williams, deputy director of the Physical Measurement Laboratory at the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology. \u201cThey\u2019ve come a long ways.\u201d  Encryption Focus  The Chinese researchers are focused on encryption, based on their patent applications. In August 2016, China\u2019s state news agency said the government had launched the world\u2019s first quantum communications satellite, and a year later claimed to have sent the first \u201cunbreakable\u201d code from space.  \u201cThat should be very scary,\u201d said Jonathan Dowling, co-director of Louisiana State University\u2019s Hearne Institute for Theoretical Physics, \u201cat least to the intelligence agencies.\u201d  In the U.S., the Department of Energy, Naval Research Lab and defense contractor Northrop Grumman Corp. are among the government entities or contractors researching quantum computers. Overall, though, the U.S. government has cut back on its own funding of computing and cryptography hardware, Dowling said.  \u2018Considered a Priority\u2019  A July 2016 report by the National Science and Technology Council under former President Barack Obama recommended it be \u201cconsidered a priority for federal coordination and investment.\u201d  In the coming age of quantum, it\u2019s an open question whether federal funding will enable the U.S to maintain the edge it\u2019s had during the PC era and smartphone wars. Scott Crowder, IBM\u2019s chief technology officer for quantum computing, told a House panel in October that \u201cthe U.S. government investment in driving this critical technology is not sufficient to stay competitive.\u201d  LSU\u2019s Dowling said it could mean the U.S. comes out the loser in the quantum race.  \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is a bunch of different things going on at once with no overall organization,\u201d LSU\u2019s Dowling said, \u201cunlike in China, where they are exactly sure what they\u2019re doing.\u201d  \u2014 With assistance by Dina Bass, Jeremy Kahn, and Ian King", "stock": "IBM", "label": 1, "date": "2018-04-09", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-08/forget-the-trade-war-china-wants-to-win-the-computing-arms-race"}, {"article": "Photo  The House on Tuesday passed a bill that gives victims and prosecutors more power to sue websites that knowingly aided sex trafficking, adding a new level of accountability for internet companies.

Six years later, Intel agreed to sell a majority stake of that business to the investment firm TPG.  Ms. James was considered a candidate to succeed Paul Otellini, who stepped down as Intel chief executive in May 2013. Instead, she and Brian Krzanich successfully pitched Intel directors on a joint plan to run the company.  She was named president, the highest-ranking job ever held by a woman at the company, and Mr. Krzanich became chief executive. Ms. James later decided to seek a chief executive spot elsewhere, opting in early 2016 to first become an operating executive at Carlyle.  Ms. James learned management skills from Andrew Grove, the acclaimed former Intel chief. Before he died in 2016, she said, Mr. Grove encouraged her to follow her dream of a chip start-up \u2014 a plan with parallels to the 1968 founding of Intel as a breakaway from a chip pioneer, Fairchild Semiconductor.  \u201cHe said, \u2018I just want you to know, this is a really hard job,\u2019\u201d Ms. James recalled. \u201cI said: \u2018I know.

One selling point is reduced power consumption, a hot topic in data centers.  Ampere\u2019s underlying technology originated at Applied Micro Circuits, which built three generations of ARM-based server chips. The Silicon Valley company was acquired in early 2017 by Macom Technology Solutions, which in October agreed to sell the business to what is now Ampere. Essentially all of Applied Micro\u2019s 300-person development team joined the new venture, Ms. James said.  She declined to disclose how much Carlyle was investing but said Ampere was well funded.

Ms. James sounds undaunted. She said Ampere\u2019s chips topped rival products on price, speedy connections to retrieve data from memory and other features.

Today many people rate plastic waste, particularly in the oceans, as a problem approaching climate change in its gravity.  Graphic images have raised public consciousness. Photographs have shown some of the world\u2019s most remote beaches that were pristine sand a decade or two ago now covered with plastic litter.  Films and television programmes such as David Attenborough\u2019s immensely popular Blue Planet II series have recorded heart-rending scenes of seabirds and marine creatures dying from plastics that they have mistakenly eaten or from debris entangled around their bodies.  People are also becoming alarmed by reading about the less visible but more pernicious problem of microplastics with dimensions measured in fractions of a millimetre. These come from various sources including the disintegration of larger plastic items, microbeads added to health and beauty products, and microfibres separating from clothing and fabrics during cleaning and laundry. The tiny particles and fibres are ingested by marine wildlife, with adverse consequences that environmental toxicologists are just beginning to investigate.  As the clamour to \u201cdo something\u201d rises in volume, politicians are responding with pledges to increase recycling and to reduce unnecessary plastic packaging. At the same time, research funds are starting to move into the field, prompting scientists and engineers to come up with ideas to tackle the problem, both by finding ways to remove existing waste from the oceans and, more importantly, to stem the flow of new plastics into the environment.  Professor Mariana Mazzucato of University College London proposed that Europe\u2019s next Framework research programme should adopt \u201ca plastic-free ocean\u201d as one of its grand challenges.  \u201cThis mission could have clear target to reduce the amount of plastic entering the marine environment by 90 per cent, and of collecting more than half of the plastic currently present in our oceans, seas and coastal areas,\u201d she says in a paper commissioned by EU science and innovation commissioner Carlos Moedas.  This would mean stopping at least 7.2m tonnes of plastic entering the marine environment and collecting at least 2m tonnes of plastic per annum, the paper adds, concluding that \u201ca very ambitious yet achievable timeline to reach this target would be circa five to 10 years\u201d.  Such a comprehensive attempt to tackle the crisis will require basic and applied research, as well as entrepreneurial innovation. The greatest technological challenge will be removing plastics from the oceans, through nets and booms moving across the sea surface which would gather up and remove or destroy rubbish \u2014 all without harming ocean life. The first targets might be the ocean gyres, circulating currents where plastics accumulate, of which the most notorious has become known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.  The Ocean Cleanup, a Dutch foundation that is planning to launch a clean-up operation there later this year, estimated in a study carried out from boats and aircraft and published this month that the Patch contains 1.8tn pieces of plastic weighing a total of 80,000 tonnes, covering 1.6m sq km of the North Pacific between California and Hawaii.  \u201cThese results provide us with the key data to develop and test our technology,\u201d says Boyan Slat, founder of Ocean Cleanup. \u201cSince the results indicate that the amount of hazardous microplastics is set to increase more than tenfold if left to fragment, the time to start is now.\u201d  The clean-up system is itself made of durable plastic. \u201cIt\u2019s quite poetic, like using fire to extinguish fire,\u201d says Mr Slat.  Floating screens extend 3m deep into the sea, suspended from ultra-strong U-shaped tubes 1km long and held in place by a drogue or sea anchor. As ocean currents flow past the screens they collect plastic debris, which can be collected every couple of months by ships for recycling or incineration.  If this year\u2019s trial of the first system goes well, Mr Slat hopes that as many as 60 collectors will be operating in the early 2020s, removing about half of the plastic from the Great Pacific Garbage Patch within five years.  Stopping plastics getting into the oceans in the first place will require a huge change in consumer behaviour and product design \u2014 fuelled by a global commitment by governments and business to phase out non-essential single-use plastics, particularly for packaging, and make it easier to recycle remaining plastic waste.  Such a circular economy will require plastic products to have a simple design, in which the different components are easily separated and the polymers from which they are made are clearly identifiable. At present the sorting machinery in recycling plants faces a confusing variety of materials mixed \u2014 or, worse, bonded \u2014 together.  Polymer chemists will also need to come up with new ways to recycle plastics that are elusive under current technology. A recent paper in the journal Science by Jeannette Garcia of IBM Almaden research centre in California and Megan Robertson of the University of Houston concluded that only two types of polymer are routinely recycled today: PET and polyethylenes, representing just 9 per cent and 37 per cent respectively of plastic production.  Researchers are already developing cost-effective new chemical recycling technologies for other plastics such as polystyrene. Such efforts, the authors say, \u201craise hope that before long recycling rates for plastics will be much higher than today\u201d.", "stock": "IBM", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-29", "source": "financial-times", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/0f3627ec-db6e-11e7-9504-59efdb70e12f"}, {"article": "WASHINGTON\u2014Lawmakers are moving to stanch the flow of U.S. technology to foreign investors, creating potential problems for a number of American companies that have bet big on partnering with China.  The Senate and House, with the backing of the White House, are working on bipartisan legislation to broaden the authority of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., a multi-agency body that has oversight of deals that could lead to the transfer of sensitive technology to rival countries. The current CFIUS statute doesn\u2019t single out any country, but in recent years, the committee has often been focused on deals involving China.  Currently, CFIUS can recommend the president block foreign entities from buying majority stakes in U.S. companies; the new bill would let the committee make similar recommendations for deals involving minority investments and joint ventures, along with transactions that it determines involve \u201cemerging technologies.\u201d  The scope of the proposed legislation is broad. China requires foreign investors to form ventures with local partners, and Washington law firms say they are receiving a surge in inquiries over what it might mean for the large number of U.S. firms active in China. The country\u2019s huge size has made it a market of interest for companies ranging from auto makers like General Motors Corp. , technology companies like Cisco Systems Inc. or other manufacturers like Caterpillar Inc. \u2014all of which have local ventures in China.  It isn\u2019t clear how broadly the new law would be enforced. For now, the most vocal corporate opponents are a handful of U.S. companies that have determined the new law might crimp business prospects by requiring companies to get the blessing of CFIUS for some joint ventures that involve shared U.S. technology.  IBM Corp. , for instance, last year agreed with China\u2019s Wanda Internet Technology to share the cloud computing technology used in its Watson artificial intelligence system. Behind the strategy is the belief that embedding IBM\u2019s technology in China\u2019s business infrastructure would steer Chinese customers toward IBM as they seek future growth.  Other large U.S. corporations, from General Electric Co. to Microsoft Corp. , see China as a crucial market for similar reasons.  IBM, among others, has said the bill\u2014known as the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act\u2014would hurt U.S. companies\u2019 ability to compete globally. \u201cForeign competitors that do not face similar regulatory restrictions will seize global market opportunities while American companies are left watching from the sidelines,\u201d IBM\u2019s vice president of government and regulatory affairs, Christopher Padilla, testified at a recent Senate hearing.  Supporters of the bill, who think it could be signed into law later this year, aren\u2019t convinced. \u201cI am concerned that some of the recent witnesses before the House and Senate have major financial conflicts of interest that prohibit an objective evaluation of the security threats we face,\u201d Rep. Robert Pittenger (R., N.C.)\u2014one of the drafters of the bill\u2014said in an email.  \u201cThe business models for IBM, Microsoft, and GE, for example, have led to the transfer of military applicable technologies to China that have likely aided the modernization of the Chinese military and intelligence agencies,\u201d said Mr. Pittenger. The bill\u2019s supporters say it complements and strengthens export regulations rather than duplicating them.  IBM and other opponents, while acknowledging national-security concerns, have suggested existing export controls to counter China rather than expanding the reach of CFIUS. IBM didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.  In an email, GE said while it supports the idea of changes to CFIUS, \u201cit\u2019s also important that any reform support America\u2019s historical leadership in attracting foreign investment, not duplicate existing and well-established export control regimes, and preserve the ability of American companies to compete globally.\u201d The company declined an interview. Microsoft declined to comment.  Several security experts say China has been sidestepping controls by taking minority stakes in U.S. technology companies or entering joint licensing ventures.  \u201cThere\u2019s a very sophisticated and well-organized plan [by China] to acquire the technology and the reality is there are people here who want to sell it,\u201d said William Reinsch, who was the Commerce Department\u2019s undersecretary for export administration under President Bill Clinton.  And for many who have watched China easily avail itself of gaps in the CFIUS review process, the bill is the minimum that can be done in a fight that is likely to get much bigger. CFIUS blocked 10 deals between 2014 and 2016 over national-security concerns; China in recent years has accounted for the largest number of reviewed transactions.  \u201cThere\u2019s a big trade war shootout coming up with China that I think, frankly, is overdue,\u201d said Adm. Dennis Blair, co-chair of the Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property and a former U.S. director of national intelligence. He said among the key technologies right now are those involving artificial intelligence, data mining and pattern recognition.  How Bill Would Broaden CFIUS\u2019s Reach Expands CFIUS\u2019s jurisdiction to partnerships where a foreign firm doesn\u2019t have a controlling interest, such as joint ventures, minority investments and licensing deals.  Adds ability to review real-estate purchases or leases near military bases or other sensitive U.S. government properties.  Updates CFIUS\u2019s definition of \u201ccritical technologies\u201d to include emerging technologies that could be essential for maintaining U.S. technological advantage over countries that pose threats to national security.

Source: Proposed Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2017  Supporters point to recent deals that they say deserve greater scrutiny because they give China access to critical technology, such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc.\u2019s 2016 joint venture with China\u2019s Tianjin Haiguang Advanced Technology Investment Co., which gave the company access to technology similar to that used by Intel Corp. in its chips. Tianjin Haiguang didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.  AMD spokesman Drew Prairie said in an email that \u201csome commentators have mischaracterized\u201d the venture and that AMD received a \u201cU.S. government classification confirming that the technology was not restricted for export\u201d\u2014a reference to Commerce Department export controls. As for the CFIUS overhaul bill, Mr. Prairie said AMD supports strengthened security but wants to make sure it doesn\u2019t have \u201cunintended consequences.\u201d Dawning Information Industry Co. , the largest shareholder of Tianjin Haiguang, didn\u2019t respond to an email.  Many businesses are also supportive of the bill, including software maker Oracle Corp. , telecommunications firm Ericsson Inc., steelmaker Nucor Corp. and railroad-car-equipment maker Greenbrier Co s. Many say an expanded CFIUS would set needed ground rules for working with Chinese firms.  Even openly supporting the bill, some companies worry, could expose them to problems\u2014not in the U.S. but in China. They don\u2019t want to be blocked from entering deals in China, or prevented from selling products in its booming economy.  \u201cWe\u2019re quiet about our support because of fear of retaliation,\u201d said an executive at a large U.S. technology company.  \u2014Kersten Zhang and Ted Greenwald contributed to this article.

As he assessed his opportunities, he became convinced that the tech start-up world had often come up short in meeting society\u2019s challenges.  This area, he said, is where he hopes he can have an impact.  Consider Mr. Chenault some much-needed adult supervision.  \u201cWhat I think is happening right now in the digital space is a maturation cycle and some people, as we\u2019ve seen, are going to handle that well and some people are going to crash and burn,\u201d he said, without naming names.  Of course, he could be talking about any of a host of companies, like Uber, Google or Facebook, the latter of which is facing a revolt among consumers and possibly regulators over the way fake news proliferates on its site.  Venture capital firms themselves are not exempt from these problems, as my colleague Katie Benner chronicled last summer with a striking expos\u00e9 of harassment by powerful investors.  \u201cGiven their age and the scale and size and impact that they can have on our society, unless they make a step up, we are going to have some serious problems,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Chenault said. \u201cAnd we do have serious problems.\u201d  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  \u201cCompanies are starting to realize that they are growing up, and in growing up, they have to assume some broader responsibilities,\u201d he added. \u201cCompanies are at different stages, from a self awareness standpoint, in accepting that reality.\u201d  Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

As start-ups are staying private longer, venture capital firms are finding that someone has to actually run the companies they invest in, to think beyond the early stages of fast growth \u2014 and a quick sale or initial public offering \u2014 and to help them scale over a decade.  \u201cThe median time to I.P.O. has risen dramatically over the last decade, from 4.9 years in 2006 to 8.3 years in 2016,\u201d according to a report from Pitchbook, a data company that tracks deals. Airbnb has been private for 10 years, Uber for nine.  When Mr. Chenault joined Airbnb\u2019s board last week, a company co-founder, Brian Chesky, whom Mr. Chenault has mentored for years, wrote a note to employees announcing the appointment. \u201cMany companies are designed to be finite,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Chesky wrote. \u201cFinite companies are focused on beating their competitors and appeasing short-term interests. But business is not finite. Unlike sports, there is no time clock, so there can be no winning or losing \u2014 there is merely surviving and innovating to endure.\u201d  Mr. Chenault believes there is real value in trying to influence start-ups early in their life cycle, so that patience and foresight become embedded in the DNA.  One problem Mr. Chenault wants to address \u2014 conspicuous to anyone paying attention, but bafflingly inconspicuous to those in the Valley \u2014 is the lack of diversity, both in gender and race, in the tech industry.  \u201cDiversity in the technology digital industry is a big issue,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t make accelerated progress in that area, it will have dire consequences for our society.\u201d  It is even worse in the venture capital industry, where there are few women and even fewer African-Americans.  The numbers are embarrassing and depressing: African-Americans make up only 3 percent of the venture capital work force, according to a study conducted in 2016 by the National Venture Capital Association and Deloitte University Leadership Center for Inclusion. Latinos represented only 4 percent of the venture capital industry.

But at this stage of his career, he believes a move to venture capital is the right \u201cvehicle\u2019\u2019 to try to make a difference. Mr. Chenault hopes to help companies not just make long-term plans, but to think about their role in society.  \u201cVenture capital firms have to be more catalytic agents of change not just in the business development,\u201d he said, \u201cbut in helping change the culture in the technology digital sector so there is a greater focus on the responsibilities they have.\u201d", "stock": "IBM", "label": -1, "date": "2018-01-30", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/29/business/dealbook/kenneth-chenault-silicon-valley.html"}, {"article": "(Reuters) - Intel Corp said on Friday shareholders and customers had filed 32 class action lawsuits against the company in connection with recently-disclosed security flaws in its microchips.  Intel logo is seen behind LED lights in this illustration taken January 5, 2018. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration  Most of the lawsuits - 30 - are customer class action cases that claim that users were harmed by Intel\u2019s \u201cactions and/or omissions\u201d related to the flaws, which could allow hackers to steal data from computers.  Intel said in a regulatory filing it was not able to estimate the potential losses that may arise out of the lawsuits.  Security researchers at the start of January publicized two flaws, dubbed Spectre and Meltdown, that affected nearly every modern computing device containing chips from Intel, Advanced Micro Devices Inc and ARM Holdings.  The companies have issued fixes but some patches slowed down computers, leading sector analysts to say producers could potentially face suits from clients and consumers claiming damages because their devices did not work as they should.  The company said the remaining two suits were securities class actions, where the plaintiffs allege that Intel and some of its officers violated securities laws by making statements about products or its internal controls that were later revealed to have been false or misleading.  The company\u2019s filing also listed three individual Intel shareholders who had filed actions against members of Intel\u2019s board and other managers, alleging that they failed their duties to Intel by failing to take action in relation to alleged insider trading.  It did not specify what allegations of wrongdoing the suit dealt with.  Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich sold 889,879 shares in the company on Nov. 29 as per a trading plan adopted on Oct. 30, making roughly $39 million from the sale, well before the details of the flaw were made public.  Bloomberg reported last month that although Intel says Krzanich\u2019s sales were part of a pre-arranged stock plan, securities lawyers believed the larger-than-usual transaction could be examined by the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC).  Krzanich said last month that Google researchers told Intel of the flaws \u201ca while ago\u201d.  Google says it informed the affected companies about the Spectre flaw on June 1, 2017 and reported the Meltdown flaw after the first flaw but before July 28, 2017.

Audi still uses Nvidia and Mobileye sensors in cars sold outside China, she said.  Nvidia, based in Santa Clara, California, has recorded revenue growth of more than 20 percent for the last seven quarters, partly because of increasing demand for autonomous vehicles.

The flaws are especially worrisome because they were built into Intel's hardware, making fixes to existing chips more challenging, but the company said it would begin shipping chips without the flaws later this year.  \"We've been working around clock,\" Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said. \"We're acutely aware we have more to do.\"  Intel did not detail the potential financial impacts of the flaws in its report, but analysts weren't really expecting the company to.  \"While Meltdown/Spectre could cause purchases to be postponed in 1H, it still too early to tell, and we doubt INTC will guide to such an event for fear of driving a self-fulfilling prophecy,\" John Pitzer, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said before the report.  After earnings, Pitzer upgraded his view of the stock from a \"neutral\" to \"outperform,\" and raised his price target from $42 to $55.  \"While Intel has modestly underperformed the [semiconductor sector] since 03/17, absolute stock performance has been strong and our valuation concern has not \u201cplayed out\u201d and is unlikely to,\" Pitzer said.

Apple's in-house chips would replace Intel's chips, thereby wiping out billions of dollars in revenue, Wall Street analysts found.  You can view Apple's stock price and Intel's stock price here.  Apple's reported plans to ditch Intel's processing chips in favor of its own has the potential to wipe billions of dollars of revenue from the chipmaker.  That total potential impact could reach between $3 billion and $4 billion of lost sales, according to RBC Capital Markets. The bank looked at the number of Mac computers with Intel units sold last year, which was roughly 19 million units, as well as the average selling price for its microprocessing units ($170 to $215) to arrive at that number. Credit Suisse analysts figured the switch could cost Intel $2.7 billion.  \"We think AAPL's potential shift to in-house designed Mac processors could create a modest impact for INTC depending on the magnitude and timing of the transition,\" Amit Daryanani, an RBC analyst wrote in a note to clients.  On Monday, when Bloomberg reported Apple was mulling building its own processors for its Macs, Intel's stock fell 5% on the news.  However, Credit Suisse analysts said the stock move was largely overblown because Apple's reported switch would only impact 4% of Intel's potential revenue and 4% of its earnings, or 17 cents per share.  \"It is clear to us that AAPL has been working towards a goal of \"moving up the stack\" if only to keep INTC \"honest\" \u2013 but we see the sell-off as an over-reaction, especially ahead of what we expect to be strong earnings,\" Credit Suisse's John Pitzer and Steven Jozkowski wrote in a note to clients.  Intel will report its quarterly earnings on April 26. Wall Street analysts expect the company to report strong sales and profits largely thanks to Intel's Data Center Group, which markets itself to enterprises and is seen as the company's primary engine for future growth.

The Netflix charge was one of the first public signs of financial cost to a studio or production company following allegations of sexual misconduct against an individual.  The source with knowledge of the matter said the charge was related to Spacey\u2019s projects. Spacey\u2019s representatives did not respond to a request for comment on Monday.  More than 30 men have accused Spacey of sexual misconduct. The Oscar-winning actor was written out of \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d the Netflix political intrigue drama in which Spacey starred as U.S. President Frank Underwood.

The purchase of Regency Outdoor Advertising, if successful, would be the largest yet for the fast-growing Silicon Valley streaming video company, which has a studio in Hollywood and is now one of the world\u2019s biggest film and TV producers.  Netflix\u2019s motivation was not immediately clear, but it could save money over time with the deal, according to industry analysts, as it ramps up spending on marketing for its original shows and movies to $2 billion this year. Netflix used Regency Outdoor billboards to promote its \u201cStranger Things\u201d and \u201cThe Crown\u201d drama series.  A billboard ad on Los Angeles\u2019s Sunset Strip can cost $140,000 per month, said Barry Lowenthal, president of The Media Kitchen, a New York-based media buyer.  \u201cThis is a smart move for Netflix because it is a very important viewing market,\u201d Lowenthal said. \u201cLos Angeles matters to the people in the industry.\u201d  Tech firms Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Hulu and Facebook Inc (FB.O) and traditional media companies such as Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) are all vying with Netflix to win subscribers.

Billboards are holding their own compared to other forms of traditional advertising such as ads in newspapers or TV that are easy to skip.  Regency Outdoor, owned by brothers Drake and Brian Kennedy, owns billboards on Sunset Strip, a portion of Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles known for its live music and night clubs and filled with splashy billboards promoting upcoming TV shows and movies.

A small but loud #DeleteNetflix campaign has burst forth on Twitter since \"The Mechanism,\" a show that is a work of fiction based on the real-life, multi-year corruption probe dubbed Carwash, was added to the streaming service Friday. Ex-users are posting proof of their now-defunct accounts in one of Netflix\u2019s most successful international markets.  Former President Dilma Rousseff, who was impeached in 2016 amid fallout from the scandal, called the show \"underhanded and full of lies.\" Prominent movie critic Pablo Villaca said he canceled his subscription after six years and encouraged others to do the same, saying the decision to air the show was \"irresponsible.\"  \"The director invents facts. He doesn\u2019t merely reproduce fake news. He has turned himself into a creator of fake news,\" according to a post on Rousseff\u2019s website. \"It would be like if a movie about the last moments of John Kennedy inserted a Lee Harvey Oswald character making accusations against the victim. Or a movie where Winston Churchill makes a deal with Adolf Hitler to attack the United States.\"  The debacle took over local media, with director Jose Padilha, who also produced the Netflix hit \"Narcos,\" responding that critics are too focused on the details and missing the bigger picture.  While this isn\u2019t the first portrayal of the corruption probe that continues sweeping through Brazil\u2019s political and business elite, the timing of the release -- on the day the operation hit its 50th phase -- has helped fuel some of the reaction.  After successive scandals that almost took down a second president in as many years, most of Congress and the presidency will be up for grabs in general elections in October. On Monday, former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva had a 12-year prison sentence for corruption confirmed by an appeals court. He awaits a Supreme Court ruling that will determine whether or not he will be arrested, and with that, influence the role he will play in the elections.  Lula leads all voter polls, and he has repeatedly reiterated his innocence and denounced the Carwash investigation as political persecution, saying he will fight until the very end.  Sergio Moro, the judge who became the face of the Carwash probe and hailed by some Brazilians as a savior of sorts for locking up corrupt politicians and businessmen, said in an TV interview Monday that while there are artistic liberties in both the movie and the show, drawing attention to Brazil\u2019s issue with corruption is important.  The show changed the names of those involved in the case -- Petrobras, as the state-run oil company at the center of the investigation is known, became Petrobrasil. Alberto Youssef, Brazil\u2019s black-market central banker who was one of the to be caught up in the probe, is portrayed as Roberto Ibrahim.  One of the biggest points of controversy is a conversation in which a politician -- who resembles Lula -- talks about an agreement to prevent the corruption probe from proceeding. The episode alludes to a political crisis surrounding President Michel Temer, which took down then-Planning Minister Romero Juca after a recording of a similar conversation between himself and a former executive linked to Petrobras emerged.  \"The left was and is just as corrupt as the right. \u2018The Mechanism\u2019 has no ideology,\" Padilha is cited as saying in Estado de S.Paulo newspaper.  Netflix is no stranger to Brazilian political drama. The company placed large ads at the Brasilia airport -- the nation\u2019s capital, where much of the Carwash probe has taken place -- to promote the latest season of House of Cards. When news broke in May that a businessman had secretly recorded the president allegedly discussing hush money in a fresh round of scandal that almost took down the government, that show\u2019s profile tweeted -- in Portuguese -- \"It\u2019s getting hard to compete.\"  On Tuesday, Netflix\u2019s official Twitter account in Brazil posted a video with a mock ad for a \"corruption store\" featuring products such as fashionable covers for ankle monitors and underwear with pockets to better store bribes.  Netflix didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment on the impact of the show, viewership or subscription data.  \u2014 With assistance by Paula Sambo, and Fabiola Moura", "stock": "NFLX", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-27", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-27/-deletenetflix-campaign-erupts-in-brazil-over-corruption-show"}, {"article": "The rapid pace of subscriber additions is impressive, but so is the amount of cash going up in flames.  The rapid pace of subscriber additions is impressive, but so is the amount of cash going up in flames.  Netflix Inc. is the Uber of the entertainment programming business. Whether Netflix investors recoil or cheer at the comparison depends on their risk tolerance.  Netflix doesn't share Uber's inclination to push boundaries, and it has a well-functioning business. But both companies are impressive growth machines that rely on outside funding to maintain the momentum. And in both cases, it's not clear what the real trajectory of the business would look like if access to capital dried up.  First, let's run through the impressive growth part of the Netflix machine.  Growing Like a Weed Netflix keeps adding streaming video subscribers rapidly Source: Bloomberg  Netflix said on Monday that it added 8.3 million more subscribers than it lost for its streaming service. That was the most new streaming customers in Netflix's history. Even in the U.S., where analysts believe more than half of households with fast internet service already subscribe to Netflix, the company added more net new streaming customers in 2017 than it did the year before. The continued pace of customer additions validates both Netflix's recent decision to raise prices on many subscribers in the U.S. and to go all-in on a globalization strategy the company unveiled two years ago.  But just like at Uber, growth comes at a cost for Netflix. That cost is the piles of money Netflix has set alight for three years to finance its globe-trotting ambitions, and to purchase -- rather than rent -- more of the TV shows and movies the company makes available to streaming subscribers. The cash costs for Netflix's streaming programming reached $8.9 billion in 2017, about double the costs from two years earlier. The number of Netflix streaming customers hasn't increased as much, at about 60 percent, over that period.  Bonfire Netflix's free cash flow has turned negative in the last three years as the company splurged on programming and international expansion Source: Netflix  Netflix also said its free cash flow would widen to as much as negative $4 billion in 2018, compared with an already stunning negative $2 billion in 2017. Netflix has already been clear it won't generate positive cash flow for years as it tries to become the preferred entertainment source for the world, and one that has profitable economics. But potentially burning through $4 billion in cash is staggering. Netflix and Uber are betting that the companies should lean into their growth and spend even more to get bigger fast. It could turn out to be a stellar bet. Or fail spectacularly.  Netflix's strategy means two things: The company must keep churning out shows compelling enough to persuade more people to subscribe, and it needs to be able to continue borrowing money at low cost to finance its losses.  So far, Netflix stock and debt investors aren't worried. Netflix bonds due in 2026 have been trading just below 100 cents on the dollar. Netflix shares shot up about 9 percent in after-hours trading after the company released its financial results. Already the company's enterprise value is more than 50 times estimated 2018 earnings excluding interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and employee stock compensation costs. Those are not characteristics indicating signs of worry.  It's hard to find fault with Netflix's execution or its track record. The company is making a rational decision to splurge while it can and borrow money while it's cheap. But no one knows what Netflix looks like in normal funding times. What happens if the debt market isn't as compliant in coming years? The Netflix growth machine suddenly looks less like a sure thing. I'd call it a roller-coaster ride, but at least roller coasters tend to follow a predictable trajectory and wind up exactly where they started. For Netflix, confidence about where the company ends up is all in the eye of the beholder.

As Netflix continues to ramp up its annual content investment, the streamer has effectively changed the paradigm for content producers in a way that both expands and limits opportunities for producers and studios as well as for rival networks competing for the best content and talent, per Digiday.  Netflix CFO David Wells said recently that in 2018, Netflix will spend $8 billion and produce 700 pieces of original content, including 80 full-length original movies and 80 foreign-language original productions from local international territories where Netflix operates.  Thanks to its massive spending, Netflix has created a seller's market for producers and studios. Here are some of the fundamental ways that the new paradigm initiated under Netflix has benefited content producers:  There are more opportunities to sell content because Netflix is such a major buyer. In addition to buying more shows than other platforms and networks, Netflix also buys more episodes.  Netflix pays producers more money upfront than other programmers.  Netflix is mostly hands-off once it agrees to buy a piece of content, and will largely give producers creative free rein over their projects.

Netflix is accessible through Altice One, which is Altice's device that allows users to access streaming services like YouTube and Pandora. Netflix is partnering with an increasing number of cable providers, and is also integrated into Comcast's Xfinity X1 set-top box.  Under the partnership, Altice customers who aren't already subscribed to Netflix can do so directly through Altice One. Altice USA is one of the US' largest broadband communications and video service providers, with 3.4 million residential pay-TV customers as of Q3 2017. For context, Comcast reported 21.3 million residential video customers for FY 2017.  The Netflix-Altice partnership represents Netflix's ambition to grow through bundling with TV and internet providers. In Q2 2017, Netflix partnered with telecom SFR Group, a France-based subsidiary of Altice, to be sold with SFR's internet and TV services, for example. Bundling with TV and internet providers is mutually beneficial \u2014 Netflix can increase its reach in new markets, while its partners are able to upsell existing customers to more expensive packages.  Bundling with cable operators allows Netflix to capitalize on consumers who view linear TV and OTT services as complementary. A September 2017 study found that 49% of consumers who had their pay-TV service for four years or more subscribe to an OTT service, per TiVo. Even with the broader trend of consumers relying less on linear TV in favor of cheaper digital alternatives, Netflix can grow through set-top box partnerships by capturing long-term pay-TV subscribers who use OTT services in addition to pay-TV.

Shares of Nvidia popped as much as 5% Tuesday amid a swath of upgrades from Wall Street firms.  Several sell-side research analysts at major firms are eyeing a buying opportunity after shares slid massively following Nvidia's temporary stoppage of self-driving car tests and a meltdown in cryptocurrency prices.

Morgan Stanley maintained its bullish target of $258 while upgrading the stock to overweight.  \"Shorter term, we have highlighted that we would use cryptocurrency related headwinds to find a buying opportunity, and we make the case here that this slowdown actually comes at an opportune time as strong gaming & a new product cycle fill the gap,\" Moore said.

The logo for Twitter, which fell more than Facebook on Tuesday, on a phone post at the New York Stock Exchange in 2015. Photo: Richard Drew/Associated Press  The highflying technology stocks had been ignoring rising threats for a while. Reality reasserted itself on Tuesday.  The immediate cause for plummeting tech shares was company-specific: Chip maker Nvidia Corp. NVDA -1.32% halted road tests of driverless vehicles after an Uber Technologies Inc. test car was involved in a fatal crash, and Facebook Inc. FB 0.40% CEO Mark Zuckerberg will be hauled before Congress. The announcements highlighted the risks to two of the biggest tech disruption themes, self-driving cars and social media.  But the market fall wasn\u2019t just about Facebook and Nvidia, or even self-driving cars and social media, although the themes mattered, with Tesla Inc. dropping more than Nvidia, and Twitter Inc. TWTR -0.83% losing more than Facebook.  Instead, the market is waking up to an even broader threat: politics. It might also be sniffing another danger, from economics.  The political risk is obvious for Facebook, which stands at the unpleasant intersection of privacy fears and fake news. Facebook is accused of unwittingly aiding the manipulation of the U.S. election by Russian agents, of helping swing the Brexit referendum and, linked to both cases, failing to notice that the personal details of 50 million users had been snatched.  The arguments about who, what, where and why are far from being resolved, but Facebook highlights the forces gathering against tech investors. Disruptive companies are bound to make powerful enemies in old industries, but the tech companies have alienated many natural supporters among the wider public through their swagger, wealth and tax avoidance. Businesses that were once beloved by consumers for taking on the corporate establishment have become the corporate establishment in the eyes of many of their customers.  Cities and states were first to flex their muscles, forcing companies such as Uber and Airbnb Inc. to follow local rules and pay taxes. The threats now are much bigger.  The European Commission is pushing for a 3% tax on the revenue of internet giants, while pressure is increasing for \u201cgig economy\u201d workers to be treated as employees. The rush by companies to pull their ads from Facebook may be merely temporary, but it shows just how far the social network has slumped in public opinion and how much privacy is becoming an issue for Americans. In Europe, privacy rules have just been tightened again.  There is also a backlash to the sheer scale of many of the big internet companies. Earnest discussion among economists about the new monopolies is unlikely to lead directly to government intervention, but a change in public perception makes antitrust action more likely. Again, Europe has been leading the way by taking on Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google.  There is a further danger, from the economy. A stronger economy should mean more companies are able to demonstrate rising sales. Investors who want growth will be able to buy businesses exposed to the economic cycle, and the fast-expanding tech companies will lose some of their exclusivity in the minds of shareholders. The same point can be seen by looking at interest rates. As rates rise, profits far in the future look less attractive, which should compress the valuation of disrupters reinvesting all their earnings in the hope of future returns. If\u2014and it is a big if\u2014you expect the economy to improve and bond yields to rise, disruptive tech stocks should be less appealing.  Tech stocks rode high in the past three years, ignoring all these concerns as investors focused on the extraordinary profits and dominant market shares many were producing. Sentiment was overly positive, and the backlash was ignored.  It isn\u2019t always true that highflying stocks fall further, but it certainly was on Tuesday. Out of the top 100 stocks in the S&P 500 for the year to Monday, 39 were in the bottom 100 on Tuesday, about double what would be expected by chance. It worked the other way, too, with just over one-third of the bottom 100 stocks for the year in the top 100 on Tuesday, led by General Electric Co. , the fifth-worst performer this year and the best on Tuesday.  In the short run, the drop means the overly fast upward momentum of the big tech stocks has abated, leaving them less exposed to further selling driven by technical factors, although Amazon.com Inc. led more falls on Wednesday after a report that President Donald Trump wants to target the company.  In the longer run, expect lots of contrition from tech company CEOs as they try to head off political pressure on the bottom line.

The former will trade under the ticker BLCN, while the latter will use the symbol BLOK.  The SEC declined to comment.  The Amplify and Reality Shares ETFs plan to buy stock in companies that have invested in blockchain, such as International Business Machines, chip company Nvidia and financial companies such as J.P.

The SEC was concerned that using \u201cblockchain\u201d in the fund name could be misleading because many of the companies the ETFs will invest in don\u2019t get the bulk of their revenue from blockchain-related activities, said Christian Magoon, CEO of Amplify.  \u201cThe SEC\u2019s whole concern is protecting investors,\u201d said Mr. Magoon. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this phenomenon that has pushed up valuations of companies that put blockchain in their name or announce a blockchain ETFs.\u201d  One recent example is Eastman Kodak, whose stock price more than doubled Jan. 9 after the company announced that it would work with a partner to launch a digital currency.

That move could bar some of the world\u2019s biggest titles from the Olympics, such as League of Legends and PlayerUnknown\u2019s Battlegrounds, which are both distributed by Alibaba\u2019s competitor Tencent Holdings Ltd. in China.

Game producers will need to be willing to share their intellectual property for free at the events, and the titles need to have a large fan base, according to Zhang.

This is as true in India as it is in Silicon Valley. Then there\u2019s Bigbasket, whose founders are veterans of the dotcom bust and mostly north of 50. Drawing on their successes and failures, they\u2019ve turned their six-year-old startup into India\u2019s biggest e-grocer and are taking on a host of competitors, including Amazon and brick-and-mortar chains operated by the nation\u2019s biggest conglomerates.  Bangalore-based Bigbasket delivers everyday cooking essentials like ghee (clarified butter), diced coconut and fragrant basmati rice, as well as 18,000 other items from bread to laundry detergent to eight million customers in 25 Indian cities. It\u2019s mostly targeting upwardly mobile young Indians keen to avoid traffic and the drudgery of supermarket runs. Last month, Bigbasket raised $300 million in an Alibaba-led round that valued the grocer at $950 million\u2014 just shy of unicorn status.  In a country where groceries account for half of the almost $1 trillion retail market, Bigbasket is using knowledge learned the hard way during the dotcom era (don\u2019t expand too quickly or use discounts to acquire shoppers) and latter-day innovation (putting vending machines inside apartment buildings; building a supply chain of competitively priced organic produce).  Founding members of Bigbasket. From left: VS Ramesh, Hari Menon, Vipul Parekh, Abhinay Choudhari and V.S. Sudhakar. Photographer: Samyukta Lakshmi/Bloomberg  \u201cWe want customers to get hooked, and make our service harder to replicate,\u201d says Hari Menon, 56, co-founder and chief executive officer. He, along with V.S. Sudhakar (58), Vipul Parekh (53), Abhinay Choudhari (47) and VS Ramesh (62), founded Bigbasket parent Supermarket Grocery Supplies Pvt, in December 2011 in a nondescript building in Bangalore\u2019s humming Indiranagar neighborhood.  Bigbasket's founders had their first brush with e-commerce back in 1999 when they started Fabmart.com to sell books, toys and groceries online. \u201cThose were the dial-up days, there were no payment gateways, and the internet user base was more hype than reality,\u201d recalls co-founder Sudhakar, standing in a Bigbasket warehouse where women shake soil from mounds of vegetables before packing them into ready-to-ship bundles. \u201cBack then, it\u2019d take 50 seconds for a page to download.\u201d  It didn\u2019t take the men long to realize that the world\u2014let alone India\u2014wasn\u2019t quite ready for online shopping, and they pivoted to physical stores under the name Fabmall. They soon merged with a brick & mortar grocery chain before getting acquired by another conglomerate. By 2006, the founders had sold out and begun angel investing.  In 2011, they were approached to regroup for an online grocery. Plenty of people told them to stay away from perishable produce in a country so obsessed with freshness that shoppers surreptitiously break okra tips and sink their fingernails into cucumbers. The founders pressed on all the same.  But their timing was propitious: smartphones were proliferating, broadband was becoming affordable, and online payments were in place. Even so, when they pitched the concept, venture firms kept bringing up Webvan, the Bay Area e-grocer that famously flamed out in 2001. The founders revised their pitch to make clear that enough had changed to make the venture viable, and eventually persuaded private equity investor Ascent Capital to put up $10 million.  Workers stock shelves at a Bigbasket warehouse in Bengaluru. Photographer: Samyukta Lakshmi/Bloomberg  Delivering fresh food is challenging everywhere, but India presents steeper obstacles. The country lacks a cooling infrastructure\u2014walk-in freezers, chill rooms, refrigerated trucks and so on. That precluded Bigbasket from buying produce directly from farms. So for the first year, every morning at 3:30, the founders visited a riotous wholesale fruits and vegetable market to buy produce, then picked up other items from a wholesaler. Eventually, Bigbasket put together its own refrigerated warehouses and a fleet of trucks. These moves let the company source the food more cheaply and eventually in 2016 led them to launch Express, a 90-minute delivery service for milk, eggs, bread and emergency supplies.  By investing in \u201cthe dysfunctional food and grocery supply chain,\u201d says Arvind Singhal, chairman of retail consultancy Technopak Advisors, \u201cBigbasket\u2019s managed to get a head start.\u201d  Still, there was a lot of competition, including LocalBanya, Sequoia-backed PepperTap and SoftBank-funded Grofers. (Of them, only Grofers is still standing.) To stay ahead, Bigbasket needed to invest in technology: web-connected, temperature-controlled trucks, GPS-traceable vans, inventory-optimizing algorithms. \u201cThe days of experimenting were over,\u201d says Parekh. \u201cWe needed to step on the pedal.\u201d This all cost money and by then venture firms were more willing to invest. Starting in the fall of 2014, Bigbasket began mopping up capital\u2014$35 million from Helion Venture Partners and Zodius Capital Advisors, $15 million from Bessemer Venture Partners, $150 million in a round led by Dubai-based Abraaj Group. By mid-2016, Bigbasket was in eight large Indian cities.  Then it was time to target smaller cities. To grab the attention of residents in burgs like Kanpur, Surat and Vijayawada, they recruited Bollywood star Shahrukh Khan as a spokesman. In one TV commercial, Khan lets shocked delivery boys in through the back door. When asked if he's the one who orders the groceries, Khan lowers his voice conspiratorially and says, \u201cThat's my role in the house.\u201d When they ask for his autograph, he says, \u201cYou'll be coming home every week from here on. We'll take a selfie next time.\u201d  Along the way, Bigbasket has constantly had to adapt to local conditions. Originally the company wanted one person to drive the trucks and carry the orders into homes. But the delivery boys (they\u2019re mostly male) didn\u2019t want to be seen as drivers because they\u2019re considered lower status in class-conscious India. So they had to hire one person for each job\u2014which turned out to be crucial because parking is scarce so the driver needs to circle the neighborhood. They also need backup workers on standby because delivery people and packers have a tendency to take time off to celebrate local cultural events. \u201cIf there\u2019s a festival, 30 delivery guys take off to their village and return after four days,\u201d Sudhakar says.  Workers bag and weigh bananas and red peppers. Photographer: Samyukta Lakshmi/Bloomberg  Attracting and keeping customers is a challenge for all e-commerce companies, and doubly so in India. Shopping habits vary widely from city to city and are deeply ingrained. So Bigbasket plies customers with samples: leafy greens in Mumbai, a rice called Sona Masoori in Bangalore. The company spent years figuring out how to achieve the ideal ripeness of bananas for its picky customers and devised exacting quality specifications for produce, including eight varieties of eggplant, and trained the sourcing team to meet them.  Customized software automatically guides drivers to their destinations, which the company says has helped it achieve a near-perfect on-time rate. Late deliveries earn customers a 10 percent discount. Missing items are refunded, plus 50 percent of whatever the item cost.  Seven hundred people handle customer complaints and answer 95 percent of calls within the third ring, Bigbasket says. Complaints range from missing items to delivery boys\u2019 hygiene. After getting one too many of these complaints, the founders mandated that their personnel wear clean shirts and open-toe sandals to suit the humid weather. \u201cA Bigbasket person visits a household an average 50 times a year so being presentable was supreme,\u201d Menon says.  A worker prepares a barcode sticker for a customer's order. Photographer: Samyukta Lakshmi/Bloomberg  Last year, the founders took stock of what they had achieved. Bigbasket was now in cities with a combined population of 150 million people, had good brand recall and was making money on each order. But, \u201cwe\u2019d barely scratched the surface of the cities we were already in,\u201d Menon says. \u201cIt was time to bring in a strategic partner.\u201d After initial conversations with Amazon, Walmart and others, the founders zeroed in on Alibaba, which runs a large online grocery business in China and has built its own delivery operations.  They\u2019re now preparing for the next phase of growth by plowing money into warehousing and delivery systems in the 25 cities to bring down delivery times to three hours. In two years, the plan is to double the range of products to 60,000 SKUs, and more than double the farmer base to 5,000, expand private label items and use Alibaba\u2019s muscle to source and import a range of merchandise to six times that of large-format supermarkets. \u201cA customer should be able to buy whatever he wants,\u201d Menon says.  Even as Amazon and local rival Flipkart push into groceries, Bigbasket\u2019s founders profess equanimity. Grocery is different from electronics or fashion and they\u2019re confident that strength in one category doesn\u2019t necessarily translate to another.Bigbasket is growing quickly and aims to double sales each year to hit $2 billion by 2020 to take the third spot in Indian retail. \u201cThey\u2019ve just gone past 100 meters in a 42-kilometer marathon,\u201d said Vishal Gupta, managing director of early investor Bessemer. \u201cThey have to hit the top spot and keep on running.\u201d", "stock": "BABA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-19", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-19/alibaba-backed-grocery-startup-battles-amazon-in-india"}, {"article": "Temasek Holdings Pte has pretty high hopes for Ant Financial.  It wants to lead a round of funding that could value the Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.-backed company at $150 billion. The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg News reported on the deal Tuesday.  I assume Singapore's state investment firm expects significant upside on that. After leaving room for a profit at IPO and a public-trading bump, Temasek probably thinks Ant is worth at least $200 billion at listing, which means around $250 billion on public markets. That's a lot to ask.  In the final full year before its IPO, Alibaba generated $2.8 billion in net income attributable to ordinary shareholders. A survey of analysts came up with a valuation of $153 billion in March 2014, six months before the company's eventual debut. Alibaba closed on day one at $231 billion. Ant has produced a 13.2 billion yuan ($2.1 billion) profit over the past year, according to Bloomberg Gadfly calculations.  Steady On Ant Financial's profit has risen, but not steadily Source: Alibaba filings  Alibaba was able to grow into its valuation unimpeded, thanks to robust expansion of China's consumer sector and the rise of e-commerce. Three-and-a-half years later, it has a market cap of $454 billion. For Ant to follow the same trajectory it'll need to keep going deeper into the financial and personal lives of Chinese citizens, finding more ways to extract value in the form of commissions, fees or data.  Facebook Inc.'s Mark Zuckerberg was just schooled on the political risks of mishandling user information. And while China may view data privacy differently to the U.S., it would be a mistake to think the government takes a laissez-faire approach.  As fellow Gadfly Shuli Ren has pointed out, Ant faces numerous regulatory headwinds that cast doubt on the inevitability of any IPO. Competition, notably from Tencent Holdings Ltd., has also hurt, and contributed to a 90 percent drop in earnings in the December quarter after Ant spent big to lure new Alipay wallet users.  Unstable Ant Financial's earnings have been very up and down Source: Alibaba, Bloomberg Gadfly  Providing payments, credit scores and loans is also a more sensitive caper than selling toilet paper and televisions, which makes the very visible hand of the Chinese government one of Ant's biggest risks. There are several ways in which the People's Bank of China has rained on Ant's parade.  Even if Ant's profit rebounds, investors would be remiss to ignore these instabilities. Tencent provides stiffer competition to Ant than Alibaba ever faced as an e-commerce player in its pre-IPO days. And there are many other fintech firms ready to eat away at both giants.

Which means that U.S. tariffs on Chinese telecoms and electronics are negative for Asia as a whole.  In a worst-case scenario, trade wars may affect Japanese markets more than China if they boost the safe-haven yen and depress the Nikkei.

January's current account deficit was $7.096 billion, worse than forecast, highlighting how dependent Turkey is on foreign capital. Higher interest rates could help fix that by luring overseas flows and reducing inflation, which is in the double digits. But there are fears President Tayyip Erdogan -- a self-declared \"enemy\" of interest rates -- is escalating his campaign for lower borrowing costs.  The lira has already fallen 6 percent to the dollar this year and a bigger current account gap than expected could tip it lower still. The central bank has little firepower to support it. Its next rate-setting meeting on April 25 could become even more crucial after next week.

Positioning data indicates that net long sterling bets are near the highest in more than three years; forecasters predict more gains for the currency which is up 4.3 percent this year and is tipped by a recent Reuters poll to rise to $1.44 in the next 12 months (it's currently at $1.41). But risks may be growing.  Heavy snow - brought by the \"Beast from the East\" cold weather bout - and weak consumer demand weighed on services in March, with the IHS Markit/CIPS services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) tumbling to 51.7 from February's reading of 54.5.

Though market expectations for a May rate hike are nearly a done deal, further weakness in data or any escalation in the trade war rhetoric could cause some unwinding in sterling bets.

Sports bankers said the Denver Broncos, New Orleans Saints and Tennessee Titans could change hands in the next few years.  While bidders have emerged for the Panthers, several of them appear unwilling to pay far more than what they believe to be the fair price \u2014 around $2.3 billion, according to people with knowledge of the process.  So far, there are six bidders, according to a person with knowledge of the process, though only four are publicly known. David Tepper, the founder of the hedge fund Appaloosa Management and a minority owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers; Michael Rubin, the chairman of Fanatics, the sports merchandise company; and Ben Navarro, who owns Sherman Financial Group, an investment firm, have each made bids to buy the team. The three offers were between $2 billion and $2.2 billion, according to several people with knowledge of the bids who could not publicly discuss the auction.  Alan Kestenbaum, the chief executive of Bedrock Industries, which owns and operates metal and mining companies, has also bid, though it\u2019s unclear at what price.  The sale of the team has been a point of focus at the N.F.L. owners meeting here. Representatives from the 32 teams were briefed on the auction on Monday. They were told that a winning bid could be selected by the end of April. Assuming the prospective owner survives due diligence, the owners could vote on that bid at their next meeting in Atlanta in late May. At least 24 owners have to approve a buyer before the transaction can be completed.  Richardson, who has taken a less active role in league proceedings in recent years, has not attended the meetings here. A team spokesman, Steven Drummond, declined to comment on the potential sale of the Panthers.  Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Soon after Sports Illustrated published a report detailing those allegations, Richardson, 82, said he would sell the team.  Certain N.F.L. owners have already started to make their preferences known. Many owners have said that, all bids being equal, they prefer Tepper because he already owns a stake in the Steelers, which he would have to sell if he bought the Panthers, and because he has the financial wherewithal, with a net worth of roughly $11 billion.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Rubin, who teamed up on his bid with Joe Tsai, the co-founder of the Alibaba Group, is also known to N.F.L. owners because Fanatics is the official retail partner of team merchandise.  While both Tepper and Rubin appear willing to continue bidding for the team, neither are prepared to pay $2.5 billion, according to several people with knowledge of the auction, though they could be posturing.  Representatives for Tepper, Rubin, Kestenbaum and Navarro all declined to comment.  At the meetings here, three owners who declined to be identified because they did not want to be seen injecting themselves into the process, said that Navarro\u2019s holdings in companies that lend to subprime borrowers might be a stumbling block for them.  Navarro\u2019s company, Sherman Financial Group, has stakes in financial services companies around the world, but 90 percent of the revenue and income comes from Credit One Bank, which issues credit cards to credit-challenged customers. Credit One has been sued for using aggressive collection techniques.  Among other things, Sherman Financial also buys and manages consumer debt. Sherman Financial also paid a $175,000 penalty to settle a case brought by New York attorney general Eric Scheiderman for unlawful debt collection.  Additionally, Sherman Financial also owns about half of a joint venture with the Chedraui family in Mexico that provides similar lending services. The company, Consupago, offers loans that are among the most expensive in Mexico to a captive market of government employees.  On Sunday, Bob McNair, the owner of the Houston Texans, voiced support for Navarro. He cited his philanthropic giving and said he had no issue with his line of work. \u201cHis business is a legitimate business,\u201d McNair told reporters. \u201cFor me, that wouldn\u2019t be a problem.\u201d", "stock": "BABA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-27", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/27/sports/nfl-panthers-sale.html"}, {"article": "Dalian Wanda Group\u2019s Wanda Film said the deal with Alibaba was signed to strengthen their partnership in movie distribution, film investment, advertising and online ticket sales.

Photo: damir sagolj/Reuters  Billionaire Wang Jianlin\u2019s Dalian Wanda Group is selling shares worth 7.8 billion yuan ($1.2 billion) in his Chinese movie-theater chain to Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA -2.21% and a firm partly backed by the government as he seeks to pay down debt at his flagship company.  Wanda Film owns and operates about 500 theaters and 4,000 screens on the mainland. The investment could open the door to future partnerships between Alibaba and Wanda\u2019s other showbiz units, such as Hollywood production company Legendary Entertainment, and may expand the e-commerce company\u2019s data bank through access to Wanda\u2019s film-goers and their customer data.  Wanda is now in business with China\u2019s two largest internet giants as it moves to shore up its balance sheet. The company struck an agreement in late January to sell a 34-billion-yuan stake in its property business, which mainly comprises shopping malls, to a group that included Chinese social-media titan Tencent Holdings Ltd.  Last year, Wanda came under fire from Beijing for its aggressive overseas deal-making, which curtailed the company\u2019s ability to pay for overseas acquisitions and repay debt. The company since has sold billions of dollars in assets both in China and abroad.  In a regulatory filing Monday, Mr. Wang\u2019s publicly listed cinema unit, Wanda Film Holding Co., said it would sell a stake of more than 12% to Alibaba and Cultural Investment Holdings Co. , a film company partly owned by the Beijing municipal government.  Alibaba will buy a 7.7% stake in Wanda Film for about 4.7 billion yuan, while Cultural Investment will take a stake of about 5% for 3.1 billion yuan, Wanda Film said.  Wanda Film said the deal with Alibaba was signed to strengthen their partnership in movie distribution, film investment, advertising and online ticket sales.  Alibaba\u2019s forays into entertainment has lagged Chinese rivals Tencent Holdings and Baidu Inc. Alibaba\u2019s film-production and digital-entertainment units also operate at a loss.  Trading in Wanda Film, which is listed on the Shenzhen stock exchange, has been suspended for almost half a year after its shares plummeted by nearly 10% on online speculation that lenders had issued a notice to unload bonds tied to its parent company. Dalian Wanda dismissed the rumors.  For Dalian Wanda, the investment could help usher its bricks-and-mortar theater operations into the digital era amid slowing growth at the box office. Movie-ticket sales in the world\u2019s second-largest economy grew 14% last year to 55.9 billion yuan, the country\u2019s media regulator said, which was slower than an average growth rate of 34% between 2011 and 2015.  Industry insiders say the rise of video-streaming in China now competes for consumers\u2019 time and money.
