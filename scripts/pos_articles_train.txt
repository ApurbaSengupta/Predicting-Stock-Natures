(Reuters) - Apple Inc on Wednesday appointed a new executive to oversee its Apple Music streaming business and hit 48 million subscribers, the company said.  FILE PHOTO: An Apple logo hangs above the entrance to the Apple store on 5th Avenue in the Manhattan borough of New York City, July 21, 2015. REUTERS/Mike Segar  Apple said it had appointed Oliver Schusser as vice president of Apple Music and international content. Schusser, who joined Apple 14 years ago, will report directly to Apple senior vice president Eddy Cue and will also oversee Apple’s services outside the United States, including the App Store and iTunes.  Apple’s top streaming music rival Spotify Technology SA has 71 million so-called premium subscribers, a figure that includes users who have given the company a credit card number for a free trial. Spotify became a public company earlier this month after holding a so-called direct listing on the New York Stock Exchange.  On a comparable basis, the Apple Music service has 48 million subscribers, 40 million of whom are paying subscribers and 8 million of whom are on a free trial, Apple said. Both firms charge $9.99 a month for streaming music but provide discounts for student and family plans.  Variety magazine earlier reported the new subscriber figures and Schusser’s promotion. He previously built up Apple’s services businesses outside the U.S. in 155 markets, including China, Japan and Latin America, Apple said.  Apple’s services business, which includes Apple Music, the App Store and iCloud, is becoming increasingly important to the Apple’s financial outlook because the smart phone market has matured and iPhone sales growth has slowed. In its most recent quarter, Apple’s services business grew 18 percent to $8.4 billion, missing analyst expectations of $8.6 billion.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc Chief Executive Tim Cook downplayed a suggestion that the company might issue a special dividend to shareholders with some of the $285 billion in cash that the company is now able to bring back from overseas.  FILE PHOTO: The Apple logo is seen on a computer screen in an illustration photo taken in Bordeaux, France, February 1, 2017. REUTERS/Regis Duvignau/File Photo  At an annual shareholder meeting at Apple Park in Cupertino on Tuesday, Cook responded to a question on whether the company might double its dividend in the wake of changes to United States tax laws that allowed corporations to bring back overseas cash at lower tax rates than before.  “Special dividends, I’m not really a fan of,” Cook responded. “But in terms of annual increases in the dividend, it is something that this board and management are committed to doing.”  Cook said the company would provide an update on its capital return program during its April earnings call with investors, as it has done for the past several years.  At the meeting, shareholders defeated two shareholder proposals, one asking that rules allowing shareholders to nominate directors to the board be eased, and another asking for a human rights committee at Apple.  The proxy access measure asked Apple to reconsider its rules for shareholders to nominate directors; the rules say that a group of no more than 20 shareholders must hold 3 percent of Apple’s stock in order to nominate a director for one of the eight director positions. The proposal did not pass, with 67.8 percent of shareholders voting against it.  Another proposal urged Apple to create a human rights panel to oversee issues such as workplace conditions and censorship in China and to report results back to the public. The proposal was defeated, with 94.4 percent of shareholders voting against it.  Apple had recommended that shareholders vote against both of the measures.  Shareholders approved four measures put forth by the company, including a required “say on pay” vote to approve pay for executives and a measure on re-electing the current directors.  Shares of Apple were up 0.1 percent at $162.84.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc, the world’s most valuable publicly listed company, is in danger of being beaten by Amazon.com Inc to the $1 trillion mark.  FILE PHOTO: The Amazon logo is seen at the Young Entrepreneurs fair in Paris, France, February 7, 2018. REUTERS/Charles Platiau  Wall Street’s optimism about last year’s 10th anniversary iPhone had propelled Apple’s stock 24 percent higher over the past 12 months, giving it a market capitalization of $893 billion.  That is $141 billion more than the $752 billion market value of Amazon, the world’s third most valuable publicly listed company, but Amazon has been quickly closing the gap.  (For graphic on Market Capitalization: Apple vs Amazon.com vs Alphabet, click: reut.rs/2Fn9hzA)  Amazon’s stock has surged 83 percent over the past year, bolstered by scorchingly fast revenue growth as more shopping moves online and businesses shift their computing operations to the cloud, where Amazon Web Services leads the market.  In January, Amazon announced that it, Berkshire Hathaway Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co would form a company to cut health care costs for their employees, which was widely seen as a threat to the existing U.S. healthcare system and underscored Amazon’s ability to disrupt markets.  Amazon dislodged Microsoft Corp as the No. 3 U.S. company by market capitalization in February.  At $783 billion, Alphabet Inc has the second largest market capitalization. The Google parent company’s stock has grown about 33 percent over the past year, faster than Apple but far slower than Amazon.  Meanwhile, optimism about Apple’s iPhone X has given way to concerns that demand for the $1,000 device may be weaker than expected.  To be sure, past stock gains are not a reliable predictor of future performance, and the surge in Amazon shares in recent years has been exceptional by most standards.  But if Amazon’s stock were to keep growing on the trajectory seen over the past year, the company’s market capitalization would hit $1 trillion in late August. Apple would reach $1 trillion around a week later if its stock price continued to rise at the same pace seen over the past year.  Alphabet would not reach $1 trillion until 2019 if its stock price continued to rise at the same pace seen over the past year.  (For graphic on race to $1 Trillion Market Cap, click: reut.rs/2DbhQYq)  Most Wall Street analysts are not quite that enthusiastic about the growth of Apple and Amazon. Analysts on average expect Apple’s stock price to rise 11 percent and reach $195 within the next 12 months, which would put its market capitalization at $989 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Analysts covering Amazon on average expect its stock to rise 10 percent within the next year to reach $1,700, which would give it a market value of $823 billion.  Apple on Thursday was up 0.60 percent at $176.05, while Amazon rose 0.31 percent to $1,549.90.  (For graphic on Analyst Price Targets: Apple Vs Amazon Market Cap, click: reut.rs/2FtMBtO)

A customer uses FaceTime on an Apple Inc. iPhone device while waiting outside the Apple Inc. store in London, U.K.  VirnetX Holding Corp. won $502.6 million against Apple Inc. after a federal jury in Texas said the maker of iPhones was infringing patents for secure communications, the latest twist in a dispute now in its eighth year.  VirnetX’s stock rose as much as 44 percent on the news in after hours trading. The company closed at $4.10 per share on Tuesday.  Apple’s stock has seen little change on the news given that the $502.6 million award is minuscule compared to the company’s profits. The company generated $20 billion profit in the first quarter, the company said in February.  VirnetX claimed that Apple’s FaceTime, VPN on Demand and iMessage features infringe four patents related to secure communications, claims that Apple denied.  The dispute has bounced between the district court, patent office and Federal Circuit since 2010. There have been multiple trials, most recently one involving earlier versions of the Apple devices. A jury in that case awarded $302 million that a judge later increased to $439.7 million.  Kendall Larsen , CEO of VirnetX, said the damages, which were based on sales of more than 400 million Apple devices, were "fair."  "The evidence was clear," Larsen said after the verdict was announced. "Tell the truth and you don’t have to worry about anything."  Apple lawyers declined to comment.  For VirnetX, the jury verdict in its favor could be a short-lived victory. The Patent Trial and Appeal Board has said the patents are invalid, in cases that are currently before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington.  The Federal Circuit, which handles all patent appeals, declined to put this trial on hold, saying it was so far along that a verdict would come before a final validity decision.  VirnetX, based in Zephyr Cove, Nevada, reported just over $1 million in revenue last year but investors have boosted the stock by more than 70 percent in hopes of an eventual victory over Apple.  The company started within government contractor SAIC Inc., tasked with developing secure communications for the Central Intelligence Agency. It was spun out with aspirations to be bought by Microsoft Corp. Instead, Microsoft paid it $200 million to end litigation in 2010, and then another $23 million for newer products.

Apple Inc. said it’s responding to government probes into a software update that slowed the performance of older iPhones.  The U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating whether Apple violated securities laws concerning its disclosures about a software update that slowed some handsets, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News on Tuesday. The U.S. government has requested information from the company, according to the people, who asked not to be named because the probe is private.  The inquiry is in early stages, they cautioned, and it’s too soon to conclude any enforcement will follow. Investigators are looking into public statements made by Apple on the situation, they added. While the slowdown has frustrated consumers, investigators are concerned the company may have misled investors about the performance of older phones.  "We have received questions from some government agencies and we are responding to them," an Apple spokeswoman said. She reiterated an earlier statement that the company "never — and would never — do anything to intentionally shorten the life of any Apple product, or degrade the user experience to drive customer upgrades."  A spokesman for the SEC declined to comment. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment. Shares of the company rose less than 1 percent to $167.71 in New York trading Wednesday. Apple’s stock has been under pressure amid reports of weaker-than-expected iPhone X sales ahead of its earnings report Thursday.  Apple iPhone X smartphones. Photographer: Michael Nagle/Bloomberg  Several weeks ago, Apple said a software update released in early 2017 slowed down the performance of older iPhones models as a way to avoid the phones shutting down at random. When it released the update, the company hadn’t said the software would slow down the devices. In December, Apple apologized for not clearly communicating this information and vowed to release another update to mitigate the concern.  Earlier in January, Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook told ABC News that when the company put out the software update that caused the performance issues for older iPhones “we did say what it was, but I don’t think a lot of people were paying attention. And maybe we should have been clearer.”  The slowdowns occur when an older iPhone’s battery reaches a certain, unspecified point of low health and can be fixed if a user replaces the battery. As part of its public apology, Apple cut the prices of battery replacements in its stores to $29, a $50 discount.  Apple plans to release an iPhone software update, called iOS 11.3, in the next few months with new features that let users monitor the health of their batteries and protect against slowdowns. If consumers turn off the throttling, older iPhones will be more prone to randomly rebooting, Apple has said. The system affects iPhone 7 models and older, but not the iPhone 8 and iPhone X, according to the company.  John Thune Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg  After apologizing to customers in December, Apple was sued by consumer advocacy groups and individual iPhone users in a global backlash. Government officials, including U.S. Senator John Thune, a Republican from South Dakota, have also questioned Apple about the slowdowns.  “Even if Apple’s actions were indeed only intended to avoid unexpected shutdowns in older phones, the large volume of consumer criticism leveled against the company in light of its admission suggests that there should have been better transparency with respect to these practices,” Thune wrote in a January letter to Cook.  For more on the iPhone, check out the Decrypted podcast:  The situation is a self-inflicted black eye on the Cupertino, California-based company. Apple has been wrestling with some other software-related issues, including processor vulnerabilities that have affected other technology companies and a login flaw that allows intruders to access files on Mac computers without a passcode.  Apple is delaying some key iPhone and Mac software features planned for release this year to focus on quality improvements, Bloomberg News reported earlier Tuesday.  This isn’t the first time the Justice Department has investigated Apple. In 2012, the department filed an antitrust suit against Apple and book publishers over the pricing of digital book downloads. In 2010 the department settled with the iPhone maker regarding anti-poaching agreements between the company and other major technology firms such as Alphabet Inc.’s Google.  In 2016, the Justice Department investigated, and then dropped a lawsuit against Apple seeking data from an iPhone connected to a mass shooting in San Bernardino, California.

Apple Inc. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook told shareholders at the company’s annual meeting to expect higher dividends and stressed that succession planning is a priority.  Cook was asked if shareholders would receive a special dividend this year as part of Apple bringing hundreds of billions of dollars in cash back to the U.S. The CEO said he’s "not a fan" of special dividends but said the company’s board remains "committed" to annual dividend increases. Directors will discuss the issue in April, as in previous years, he noted at the meeting inside the company’s new Steve Jobs Theater, in Cupertino, California.  Cook also made some of his most explicit comments on succession planning, saying that one of his most important roles as CEO is properly "passing the baton" to a new leader. Every Apple board meeting in recent years has had succession planning on the agenda for all key executive roles, he said.  The comments were prompted by a question on Cook’s succession and that of Jony Ive, the company’s chief design officer. Cook, 57, was named CEO in 2011, succeeding Jobs. Ive returned to his management role in December.  The CEO was also quizzed on the mobile payments industry. While Apple Pay has an "extraordinary future ahead of it," the acceptance of mobile payments has taken off slower than he expected, Cook said. Still, there’s been rapid adoption over the past year in Japan, China and Russia, he added.  Asked about diversity, Cook said half of Apple’s hires last year were either female or underrepresented minorities.  For more on Apple, check out the Decrypted podcast:

Apple Inc. announced new versions of the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus in red, keeping its entry-level iPhones fresh after being overshadowed for months by the iPhone X.  iPhone 8 in red Source: Apple  The new color scheme is part of the "PRODUCT(RED)" initiative, a program that gives a percentage of sales to the Global Fund to fight HIV/AIDS. Apple didn’t announce a red version of the iPhone X, which remains available in either grey or white.  It’s the second year in a row that Apple has rolled out a red version of its latest iPhone. Last March, Apple launched a red iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus and discontinued those models about six months later when the initial iPhone 8 line launched. The red iPhone 8 models cost the same as the gold, grey, and silver versions, at $699 for the smaller model and $799 for the Plus. The new color goes on pre-order Tuesday and is available in stores from April 13, Apple said.  iPhone X red leather folio Source: Apple  The back of the phone is red, and the front is black.

Apple Inc. said it will bring hundreds of billions of overseas dollars back to the U.S., pay about $38 billion in taxes on the money and spend tens of billions on domestic jobs, manufacturing and data centers in the coming years.  The iPhone maker plans capital expenditures of $30 billion in the U.S. over five years and will create 20,000 new jobs at existing sites and a new campus it intends to open. The Cupertino, California-based company’s shares rose 1.7 percent to a record closing price of $179.10.  “We are focusing our investments in areas where we can have a direct impact on job creation and job preparedness,” Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said in a statement Wednesday, which also alluded to unspecified plans by the company to accelerate education programs.  Apple also told employees Wednesday that it’s issuing stock-based bonuses worth $2,500 each following the new U.S. tax law, according to people familiar with the matter.  In its December approval of the most extensive tax-code revisions since 1986, Congress scrapped the previous international tax system for corporations -- an unusual arrangement that allowed companies to defer U.S. income taxes on foreign earnings until they returned the income to the U.S. That “deferral” provision led companies to stockpile an estimated $3.1 trillion offshore and many were criticized for the moves, including Apple.  By switching to a new system that’s designed to focus on domestic economic activity, congressional tax writers also imposed a two-tiered levy on that accumulated foreign income: Cash will be taxed at 15.5 percent, less liquid assets at 8 percent. Companies can pay over eight years.  New Jobs  Apple is the first major U.S. technology company to act on the new tax law and it joins others, such as Intel Corp., in responding to criticism by President Donald Trump and others that corporations have been ignoring American workers and manufacturing. Job creation was a key pillar of Trump’s election campaign. That means the new positions created by Apple are likely to have a more significant political impact than its $38 billion tax payment, according to Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business.  “The thrust here is American jobs, jobs on American soil, build manufacturing here, don’t build everything in China,” Gordon said. “You can’t have an announcement of a million jobs. But you can have companies like Apple saying that we’re going to have 20,000 new jobs here. If other companies say they’re going to have new jobs too, it does add up.”  For more on Apple, check out the Decrypted podcast:  Later Wednesday, Trump tweeted a response lauding Apple’s announcement. “I promised that my policies would allow companies like Apple to bring massive amounts of money back to the United States,” he wrote. “Great to see Apple follow through as a result of TAX CUTS. Huge win for American workers and the USA!”  Apple has the largest offshore cash reserves of any U.S. company, with about $252 billion at the end of September, the most recently reported fiscal quarter. The tax rate indicates that Apple is likely bringing back a majority of its overseas cash back to the U.S., leaving only a small portion for international investments like retail stores.  “They’re going to have well over $200 billion by the end of this year that will be available for incremental investments, capital returns and M&A,” said Matthew Kanterman, a New York-based Bloomberg Intelligence analyst. The new tax law lets U.S. companies bring overseas cash reserves back home in one year and pay the resulting tax bill over eight years. “And Apple hasn’t historically done big M&A,” he said.  Five-Year Spending Plan  The $30 billion in capital expenditures will come as part of $350 billion that Apple expects to spend in the U.S. over the next five years. The 20,000 new jobs include additional Apple employees at its campuses, data centers, and retail stores, but not third-party developers for iPhone and Mac apps, an economy Apple has touted in the past.  Apple said that part of the $30 billion in capital expenditures will go toward a new U.S.-based campus, new data centers and additional supplier investments. The company, which opened a new headquarters in Cupertino last year, said its new U.S. site initially will be focused on employees who provide technical support to Apple product users. The new location, which Apple said it will announce later this year, will be similar to the company’s existing campus in Austin, Texas, for supply-chain and technical-support employees.  Can This Tax Proposal Lure Companies and Cash Home?: QuickTake  Apple said it will increase its local manufacturing fund, announced last year, from $1 billion to $5 billion, indicating that it will be sourcing more components for its products domestically. As part of the original fund, Apple invested in Corning Inc. and Finisar Corp., companies that make components for iPhone glass screens and lasers for Face ID and AirPods, respectively.  “These are probably many capital expenditure initiatives and new site build-outs that Apple was already planning on doing regardless of repatriation,” said Michael Olson, an analyst at Piper Jaffray, who has the equivalent of a buy rating on the stock.  “What’s not said in this release is that there is more potential for increased buybacks for shareholders and acquisitions that might not have taken place if it were not for the cash influx from overseas,” Olson said. Apple typically provides updates on its share buyback program when it announces second quarter earnings.  — With assistance by Alexis Leondis

Apple Inc. has gone all-green.  The company’s sites worldwide are now completely powered with clean energy, according to a statement Monday. That comprises retail stores, offices, data centers and co-located facilities in 43 countries, and is up from 96 percent reported a year ago.  Corporations have emerged as big buyers of clean energy, driven by large technology companies that are conscious of both cost and climate change. Google, the top corporate buyer, said last week it has enough renewable energy to meet all its needs. Apple is also urging suppliers to follow its lead. It said Monday that nine additional manufacturing partners have agreed to power all of their Apple production with clean power, bringing the total to 23.  “It’s a strong suggestion,” Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives, said in an interview Monday. “It will at some point become a requirement.”  Apple is currently building two data centers in Denmark that will run entirely on clean power. The company has 25 operational renewable-energy plants around the world, and 15 more are being built. Once those are completed, it will have more than 1.4 gigawatts of clean capacity across 11 countries.  — With assistance by Mark Gurman

Apple Inc., seeking to bolster its wearables business, is working on upgrades to its wireless AirPods headphones, according to people familiar with the matter.  Like with its mobile devices -- the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch -- Apple intends to frequently update the AirPods with new hardware features. The Cupertino, California-based technology giant is working on a new version for release as soon as this year with an upgraded wireless chip, the people said. A subsequent model for as early as next year is planned to be water resistant, they added, asking not to be identified discussing private product plans.  Apple Inc. AirPod wireless headphones. Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg  The model coming as early as this year will let people summon Apple’s Siri digital assistant without physically tapping the headphones by saying "Hey Siri." The function will work similarly to how a user activates Siri on an iPhone or a HomePod speaker hands-free. The headphones, internally known as B288, will include an upgraded Apple-designed wireless chip for managing Bluetooth connections. The first AirPods include a chip known as the W1, and Apple released the W2 with the Apple Watch last year.  The idea for the water-resistant model is for the headphones to survive splashes of water and rain, the people said. They likely won’t be designed to be submerged in water. The latest iPhones can survive splashes, while the Apple Watch is considered "swim-proof." Apple’s plans could change or be delayed, the people said. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.  Apple's Other Sales Boom Other Products category is Apple's fastest growing division thanks to devices like AirPods  The AirPods are designed by the same department that produced the HomePod speaker, Bloomberg News reported last year. Apple introduced the first AirPods in 2016 alongside the iPhone 7 as a way to replace the traditional wired headphone jack. Since launch, AirPods have been considered one of the top-performing Apple products and have resonated with both reviewers and consumers.  Apple’s W1 chip in Airpods. Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg  The product helped take wireless headphones mainstream. It was one of the first models to be fully wireless and come in a case that charges the headset. Similar products followed from Google, Sony Corp., Samsung Electronics Co., Motorola and Bose. AirPods accounted for 85 percent of the money spent in the U.S. on wireless headphones since they debuted, research firm NPD Group estimated last year.  Apple’s Other Products segment, which includes AirPods, Beats headphones, the Watch, Apple TV and accessories, generated more than $5 billion in revenue for the first time in the company’s fiscal first quarter, representing 36 percent year-over-year growth.  "Wearables were the second-largest contributor to revenue growth after iPhone, which is impressive," Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said during a conference call with analysts earlier this month, adding that sales jumped almost 70 percent last year.  The category may continue to grow. Apple has said it is releasing an upgraded AirPods case this year that allows the headphones to be recharged wirelessly, like the iPhone X. The company is also working on an augmented-reality headset that would launch in 2020 at the earliest, Bloomberg News has reported.  Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman takes a closer look at Apple AirPods.

Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg hit back against Tim Cook, calling the Apple Inc. CEO’s criticism of the social-media giant "extremely glib."  Cook was asked about Facebook’s privacy crisis last month and called for stronger regulation of user data. A day after, Cook said he "wouldn’t be in this situation" if he were in Zuckerberg’s shoes, in an interview with Recode and MSNBC. While Facebook makes money selling targeted advertisements based on user data, Apple’s profit comes from hardware products like the iPhone, iPad, and Mac.  Zuckerberg responded in an interview with Vox, published Monday: "I find that argument — that if you’re not paying, that somehow we can’t care about you — to be extremely glib and not at all aligned with the truth."  "There are a lot of people who can’t afford to pay" for a service and that having an "advertising-supported model is the only rational model that can support building this service to reach people," Zuckerberg said. "If you want to build a service which is not just serving rich people, then you need to have something that people can afford."  In times of crisis, tech companies sometimes huddle together to defend the industry. When Apple was fighting an FBI attempt to get into an encrypted iPhone, Facebook joined a group of other large firms to support Cook’s stance. Still, Apple executives, including Steve Jobs, have criticized internet company advertising business models in the past.  Facebook shares fell 2.8 percent to $155.33 at 1:23 p.m. in New York, leaving them down 12 percent so far this year. Apple is down 2.4 percent in 2018.

FILE PHOTO: Apple logo is pictured inside the newly opened Omotesando Apple store at a shopping district in Tokyo, Japan Thomson Reuters By Stephen Nellis  (Reuters) - Apple Inc said on Wednesday that it had found violations of its labor and environmental policies for suppliers, such falsifying work hours data, as it expanded the scope of its annual audit of conditions of workers making its iPhones and other products.  Apple runs one of the largest manufacturing chains in the world, but most of the work is done at factories owned by contractors.  Apple audited 756 suppliers in 30 countries, 197 of which it was auditing for the first time.  Apple said in its annual supplier responsibility report that the proportion of "low performers," or suppliers scoring less than 59 points on its 100-point scale, fell to 1 percent in 2017 from 3 percent in 2016 and 14 percent in 2014. "High performers" with scores of more than 90 rose to a record high of 59 percent from 47 percent the year before.  Apple found 44 so-called "core violations" of its labor rules in 2017, double the previous year. Those included three instances of employees forced to pay excessive fees for a job, a practice Apple banned in 2015.  In one case, over 700 foreign contract workers recruited from the Philippines were charged a total of $1 million to work for a supplier. Apple said it forced the supplier to repay the money.  Compliance with Apple's 60-hour work week fell to 94 percent of suppliers from 98 percent the year before. Moreover, Apple said it uncovered 38 cases of falsification of working hours data in 2017, up from 9 cases the year before.  Apple said the increase was driven by the fact that it brought on a number of new suppliers in 2017 and started tracking the working hours data of 1.3 million supplier employees, 30 percent more than in previous years.  In the report, Apple also said it was launching a new women's' health initiative at its supplier plants, with a goal of reaching 1 million women by 2020. And it said that it had launched a program in China to train workers to become factory line leaders, who often make 20 percent to 30 percent more than line workers.  On Wednesday, Apple also issued its so-called conflict minerals report, which is required by United States securities regulators. The report lists suppliers of sensitive metals such as tin and gold.  Apple company said that 16 smelters and refiners left its supply chain in 2017, 10 of which were dropped because they would not participate in a third-party audit of their practices. Six left of their own accord.  Apple also outlined new rules on student labor after a discovery last year that some Chinese students were working more than 11 hours a day assembling its iPhone X.

Jimmy Iovine at the LACMA 50th Anniversary Gala. Charley Gallay/Getty  The Apple Music dealmaker Jimmy Iovine has confirmed he's moving to a consulting role at Apple.  It had been speculated since January that Iovine was stepping back from helping run Apple Music.  Iovine previously denied a report he was stepping down, calling it "fake news."  After months of media speculation, the Apple Music dealmaker Jimmy Iovine has finally acknowledged he's stepping back from his role at Apple.  Iovine said in an interview with The Times of London that he was moving to a consulting role at Apple.  "I'm gonna consult [for] them," Iovine said. "I'm just taking a slight step back. I'm not gonna be in the firing line. I'm committed to Apple and Apple Music. So whatever form that takes ... But I'm just not 'that guy' anymore."  "Some people can work until they're 90," he said, "I don't have to do a certain thing, I find peace in other places right now. The person in [the documentary series 'Defiant Ones'] — I'm not gonna work like that anymore. Cos that's where I used to take all my pain and put it in there."  The Times asked Iovine whether he was healthy. "I'm healthy as f---!" he said.  Iovine joined Apple in 2014 after it spent $3 billion (£2.1 billion) to acquire Beats, which he cofounded with the rapper Dr. Dre. Apple took Beats' fledgling streaming music service and used it as the basis of its Apple Music service. Since then, Iovine has been working as a dealmaker, connecting Apple to the music industry.  A Wall Street Journal story published earlier this week cited sources saying Iovine was stepping back from Apple and moving to a consulting role.  And Billboard reported in January that Iovine was leaving in August when his Apple shares fully vest. Iovine publicly denied that report, saying "we need Donald Trump here to call it 'fake news.'"

Apple Park's "spaceship" building from a distance. Apple  Apple just finished a $5 billion headquarters, Apple Park, which some say is an architectural landmark.  Non-Apple employees are not allowed in, though, and Apple's unlikely to offer tours.  It's because there's a lot of confidential information inside the building, Apple CEO Tim Cook said.  CUPERTINO, California — Shareholders at Apple's annual meeting on Tuesday got to experience the new Steve Jobs Theater in Apple's recently opened $5 billion campus, Apple Park. But they didn't get to see inside the main "spaceship" building.  So one shareholder asked CEO Tim Cook: When can we get a tour of Apple Park?  The answer: Probably never. Because there are secrets inside the spaceship.  "The problem with opening up the main facility for tours is we have so much confidential stuff around," Cook said. "It's sort of the bane of my existence to hold things confidential now."  Cook's answer echoes a comment about the campus last year from Apple's head designer, Jony Ive, who called it "our house."  "We didn't make Apple Park for other people," Ive said. "So I think a lot of the criticisms ... are utterly bizarre, because it wasn't made for you. And I know how we work, and you don't."  Basically, you're not going to get to experience the inside of the building without being an Apple employee with a badge.  If you have a meeting at Apple, you're generally not allowed to explore the place, people who have discussed business at Apple's headquarters have said. And Instagram photos from the interior of the building posted by employees started being removed after Business Insider published a handful earlier this month.  Cook joked with the shareholder, "I'll send you a picture."  The next best thing  The augmented-reality experience Tim Cook was talking about. Kif Leswing Apple did, however, build a place for tourists on its new campus. It's across the street.  The Apple Park visitors center is a combination of an Apple Store, a cafe, and a shrine to all things Apple.  Fans and tourists are "the reason we created the visitors center, which has the AR experience," Cook said, referring to Apple's augmented-reality space that includes a scale model of an Apple Park that you can animated with an iPad camera.  "If you haven't been to this, I'd really encourage you to do it," he said.  He continued: "The roof deck gives you a nice visual. We created that to give Apple users and Apple fans to get them as close to the park itself." From the roof deck, you can see part of the spaceship building through the trees.  While the visitors center is nice and has some products that aren't available anywhere else — including T-shirts, postcards, and Apple-branded baby clothes — it's not the inside of Apple Park. Take a limited peek here.

FILE PHOTO: The new iPhone X is pictured at the Apple Store Marche Saint-Germain in Paris Thomson Reuters By Stephen Nellis  SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - When Apple Inc announces its first-quarter earnings on Thursday, investors will seek signs of whether the company's $999 iPhone X launched last autumn was a Steve Jobs-style hit or, as more analysts suspect, a letdown.  In recent weeks, Wall Street analysts have come to a consensus that iPhone X sales were slower than previously expected for the first quarter that ended in December and may drop off sharply for the March quarter.  Analysts have lowered their expectations for Apple's second- quarter revenue guidance to as low as $60 billion from a previous average of $67 billion.  Combined with concerns about the impact of an imbroglio in which Apple acknowledged slowing down phones with worn-out batteries, the weak iPhone X performance has again raised the question of whether the company can keep up its rapid revenue growth without a new hit product.  With eight different iPhone models priced from $350 to $999 on sale over the holidays, Apple showed that it has moved decisively away from co-founder Jobs' tight lineup of premium-priced products and embraced an iPhone-for-everybody strategy.  Analysts are questioning whether Apple can boost its revenue even as iPhone sales essentially plateau.  "Apple will have to answer the question of what's next," UBS analyst Steven Milunovich wrote in a note to investors. "More services to monetize the base of one billion customers and eventually enhanced [augmented reality] capabilities may be part of the answer."  Analysts still expect Apple to post record revenue, hitting the top of its $87 billion guidance for the holiday quarter. But they have slashed revenue estimates for the March quarter and expect the company to sell fewer iPhones in fiscal 2018 than initially thought.  Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi predicted as few as 220 million iPhones will sell in fiscal 2018, just above the 216.7 million sold in 2017 and well below the 2015 peak of 231.2 million.  BTIG analyst Walter Piecyk spotlighted a steadily lengthening replacement cycle as new iPhones offer only small improvements over prior models. Now that it has become clear that a new battery can give life to an old phone, more customers may choose to delay an upgrade, especially with Apple cutting the price of a battery replacement to $29 from $79.  Analysts still believe Apple will report sales of $272.2 billion for its fiscal 2018, 18.7 percent above its $229.2 billion in fiscal 2017. That will be driven largely by higher average prices paid for iPhones, they said.  'WILD CARD'  But Apple does not give data on specific models, and with the wider lineup, analysts must do more guesswork based on surveys and other tools. They also find it harder to predict how much money Apple makes off each phone.  "We believe that gross margins are a key wild card for investors, given limited transparency into relative margins across iPhone [models]," Sacconaghi said in a note to investors.  All in all, it's a far cry from the days of Jobs, who shrank the company's product lineup when he returned to the helm in 1997 and kept it limited to a few models of each product at one time until his death in 2011.  But the Apple of today has something Jobs never had: An imposing user base into which it can sell a host of other products and services.  Trip Miller, managing partner at Gullane Capital and an Apple investor, believes Apple's services segment is the firm's next hit product. Analyst expect it to hit sales of $34.7 billion this year, up 16 percent.  (Reporting by Stephen Nellis; Editing by Jonathan Weber and Cynthia Osterman)

According to KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo and Apple Insider, Apple could be working on a brand new pair of wireless headphones for later this year. While the company already owns Beats, those over-the-ear headphones could be sold under the Apple brand.  It seems like the AirPods are a success, and the company wants to capitalize on this market. The new headphones would feature the same convenience of the AirPods, but with better sound quality. Apple could ship them at some point in Q4 2018, just in time for the holiday season.  Some users also can’t use the AirPods because of the shape of their ears. This new pair of headphones should solve this issue. Headphones are usually more expensive than wireless earbuds, so this new accessory could cost even more than $159.  Kuo has heard that Apple is working with metal injection molding company SZS. That’s probably how KGI managed to learn about this project. It’s unclear how different they’re going to be from Beats-branded wireless headphones.  In particular, you can already find Beats Solo3 with an Apple W1 wireless chip. It uses the same wireless chip as the one that you can find in the AirPods.  But if you combine today’s rumor with previous rumors, Apple could unveil a brand new lineup of wireless accessories later this year. There could be new AirPods with always-on “Hey Siri” as well as those new headphones. They could run the same improved W chip.  Apple also announced a wireless charging case for the current AirPods. Slowly but surely, Apple is building a new product line of audio accessories.

Apple has just poached one of Google’s top AI executives in a move likely to have far-reaching consequences.  Apple has hired John Giannandrea, previously Google’s head of AI and Search, The New York Times reports. Giannandrea will lead Apple’s “machine learning and A.I. strategy,” the Cupertino company said in a statement to the Times; he will be one of only 16 executives that report directly to CEO Tim Cook.  Just yesterday, The Information (paywalled) had reported that Giannandrea would be stepping down from his role at Google and would be replaced by 19-year Google veteran Jeff Dean. Giannandrea first joined Google in 2010 after it acquired MetaWeb, where he served as CTO. The startup sought to make search results more contextually aware through its hefty database of tagged data.  The hire is particularly important as Apple has seemed to fall far behind its rivals in the race to build smarter software powered by artificial intelligence. Siri, the digital assistant into which Apple has pumped much of its consumer-facing AI technologies, is far behind Amazon’s Alexa and Google’s Assistant in capabilities.  TechCrunch chatted with Giannandrea at our most recent Disrupt SF conference, where he spoke at length about how humans could help make computers smarter, but that we could also lend them our biases if we aren’t careful.

Apple is preparing a couple of updating models of AirPods, according to Bloomberg. The popular fully wireless earbud-style headphones that Apple introduced last year are currently on track for a refresh in 2018 with the addition of a new version of the “W” line of chips that Apple created specifically to manage and improve Bluetooth-based connections between gadgets.  The 2018 hardware refresh would include not only an improved W chip (possibly the W2 added to the Apple Watch last year, or perhaps even a W3) but also the ability to activate Siri just by voice, rather than by physically tapping the AirPod in your ear, as is the case currently.  Like with Amazon’s Echo devices or the iPhone, a user would be able to trigger the virtual assistant simply by saying the wake word aloud – “Hey Siri,” in this case. That would indeed to a step-up in terms of shifting AirPods to a voice-first interface device.  As for the successor currently planned for 2019 (though Bloomberg notes those plans could easily change between now and then), it will add a new level of water-resistance, which Bloomberg reports will be designed to protect against “splashes of water and rain,” rather than full submersion like the current Apple Watch.  AirPods are doing well by all accounts, so putting them on an update cycle similar to the iPhone and other of Apple’s high-demand products seems fairly logical. It’ll be interesting to see if customers choose to upgrade in the same way they do with Apple’s other high selling devices, and what other updates might be in store (please made variable fit tip design, Apple, so that I can finally wear these things without requiring a little foam sleeve).

Apple is planning to use its own chips for its Mac devices, which could replace the Intel chips currently running on its desktop and laptop hardware, according to a report from Bloomberg.  Apple already designs a lot of custom silicon, including its chipsets like the W-series for its Bluetooth headphones, the S-series in its watches, its A-series iPhone chips, as well as customized GPU for the new iPhones. In that sense, Apple has in a lot of ways built its own internal fabless chip firm, which makes sense as it looks for its devices to tackle more and more specific use cases and remove some of its reliance on third parties for their equipment. Apple is already in the middle of in a very public spat with Qualcomm over royalties, and while the Mac is sort of a tertiary product in its lineup, it still contributes a significant portion of revenue to the company.  Creating an entire suite of custom silicon could do a lot of things for Apple, the least of which bringing in the Mac into a system where the devices can talk to each other more efficiently. Apple already has a lot of tools to shift user activities between all its devices, but making that more seamless means it’s easier to lock users into the Apple ecosystem. If you’ve ever compared connecting headphones with a W1 chip to the iPhone and just typical Bluetooth headphones, you’ve probably seen the difference, and that could be even more robust with its own chipset. Bloomberg reports that Apple may implement the chips as soon as 2020.  Intel may be the clear loser here, and the market is reflecting that. Intel’s stock is down nearly 8% after the report came out, as it would be a clear shift away from the company’s typical architecture where it has long held its ground as Apple moves on from traditional silicon to its own custom designs. Apple, too, is not the only company looking to design its own silicon, with Amazon looking into building its own AI chips for Alexa in another move to create a lock-in for the Amazon ecosystem. And while the biggest players are looking at their own architecture, there’s an entire suite of startups getting a lot of funding building custom silicon geared toward AI.  Apple declined to comment.

While Apple continues to focus its eye on how to step up its game in the area of original content, it’s also striking partnerships that could help its offensive line in one specific category: sports. The company is debuting a new section in Apple News that will be dedicated to the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang.  The Olympics section will appear in the “For You” section, the part of Apple News where the platform delivers a more personalised set of stories based on publications and channels that you look at regularly.  The company will be partnering with NBC Olympics for the service, which will feature videos, articles and infographics also from a selection of sources. The portal will work outside of the US — everywhere that Apple News is live — but since NBC only holds the rights to coverage in the U.S. the video links will only appear and work there. The other partners involved are essentially Apple’s other news partners.  While this Winter Olympics section will be appearing in News, the portal will be doing more than just reporting what has happened in the latest events. It will also include a planner for people to figure out what is showing when, and let you add events you want to watch to your calendar.  It will also link to live streams, although these and full replays of specific events will link outside to the NBC Sports app, Apple says. Clips from events can be watched directly within the Apple News app. There will also be a medal tracker and morning roundups for those in timezones that are far from where the games are taking place.  Apple itself has been making several moves to beef up its own content plays. The thinking is that having more exclusivity and ownership of what is provided on its own video and music services could be a way of differentiating them from the rest of the digital media pack, and potentially making them more attractive for consumers to pay to use.  Sports has not really been a huge focus in that context up to now — a deal with Spielberg and family-friendly comedies and dramas with broad appeal seem to be the order of the day. However, Apple did add a dedicated Sports tab to Apple TV in September, perhaps laying the groundwork for this and many more activities down the line.  We’re in a mini-spate of tech and media companies getting their ducks in line for the big event.  The news comes a day after Google launched its own series of Olympics coverage and features. Both Google’s and Apple’s news hits speak to how those in the business of tech but outside the traditional business of media are looking to get their own share of audience around the Olympics, which is one of the most-watched sporting events in the world.  One thing that is not clear to me is why Apple has chosen to put its Olympics coverage in “For You”.  I have two guesses. On the one hand, it will give a little more attention to the section: Apple has never detailed how much “For You” is used compared to the rest of Apple News, but I’m guessing what’s at the top of the app is used the most when you first open it. On the other hand, the Olympics has mainstream interest and so putting Winter Olympics into the sports section might have meant that a wider range of users may never see it.  Updated with more information about how the app will work.

After teasing the feature back in September, Apple is adding support for live news in the TV app on the iPhone, iPad and Apple TV — 9to5mac first spotted the new section. For now, it’s quite limited as it only supports a handful of channels for American users.  If you’re running the most recent versions of iOS and tvOS, the feature should now be live. I’m running iOS 11.2.5 on my iPhone and the new section is available without any additional update.  On the main ‘Watch Now’ tab, if you scroll past your ‘Up Next’ queue and the top recommendations, there’s a new ‘News’ section. It features six different live streams — CBS News, CNN, Fox News, Cheddar, CNBC and Bloomberg.  If you tap on one of those icons, it launches the live stream in each of those apps. The TV app uses deep-linking to go straight to the live stream.  And if you don’t have the app yet, your device is going to ask you if you want to download the app from the App Store. This new feature should drive downloads for those six companies.  Once you have those apps on your device, you can ask Siri “Hey Siri, let’s watch Bloomberg” so that you don’t even have to open the TV app in the first place. Let’s hope Apple is going to bring this live news feature to other countries.

In the race for in-ear AI, Apple has the clear advantage despite the fact that their intelligent assistant is one of the dumbest of the bunch.  Yesterday, reports emerged that Apple was working on a pair of follow-ups to its Airpods headphones that could bring them always-on Siri functionality as well as a splash-proof design. As we think about all the things that Apple could do right with its next set of wireless earbuds, it’s easy to reflect on all that Google did wrong with its Pixel Buds and how much of an opportunity they still have.  Google Assistant lends so much potential to a pair of smart wireless earbuds from Google. The fact is that Siri doesn’t hold a candle to Google Assistant in many ways, and while the functionality of voice control on the AirPods is largely focused on music and calls, the superior intelligence of Google Assistant should make them a much clearer companion for a set of earbuds.  Hardware is still very much a side project for Google, but as the company prioritizes home assistant hardware, it really doesn’t make sense that they’re not putting more resources into a pair of wireless headphones. The Pixel Buds need a more purposeful design that minimizes friction and delivers Assistant insights more effortlessly in a package that feels like more than just a follow-on.  The AirPods are an engineering marvel, and while some of the functionality of the Pixel Buds was interesting — mainly their ability to interface with the Pixel 2 for language translation — they fell flat on design. Google needs to rethink its wireless earbuds from the ground-up and focus more on creating something with the sleekness of the Pixel phones rather than the fabric-obsessed friendliness of their Home devices. Cutting the woven cord and moving to a truly wireless form factor is a necessary step, as is shrinking down the size of the Bud part of the product. It’s really not about the sound quality as much as it is about the connectivity and the lack of friction. While FastPair has been a great step in simplifying the bluetooth pairing, there are still some quirks that aren’t present with Apple’s W1 chip.  While Siri is always quick to refer you to search results when it doesn’t have an answer (a frequent occurrence), Assistant’s optimization for its display-free Home devices has led it to order functionality around the assumption that there’s not always a screen available to default to. Today, Google announced that it was bringing location-based notifications and voice-optimized routine functionality to its Home devices so it could complete regular custom tasks without you having to pepper it with commands, stuff like this would be ideal for earbuds that are always-listening, something that Google could do much more with than Apple.  Even as features take months to roll out, Google has still shown a degree of nimbleness on the voice assistant front that Apple can’t match in annual WWDC keynotes. While Amazon is just as quick with Alexa, Google Assistant’s deepening integration with Android establishes an arena where they should be the clear champion.  AirPods are clearly the best wireless earbud that an Apple user can own and even with the reduced functionality that still might be true of Android phones. People are building tools to bring iOS-only feature sets to Android and that fact alone should suggest Google take a more serious look at its own hardware and the opportunity that it’s losing out on.

Apple is doing it again. The company just unveiled a new version of the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus. It has a bright red enclosure and a black front. A portion of Apple’s proceeds will fund HIV/AIDS grants from the Global Fund.  Other than that, it’s an iPhone 8. You’ll get the exact same features and components as in other iPhone 8 models. The iPhone 8 is also available in gold, silver and (“space”) gray. Alas, there’s still no rose gold option.  When Apple unveiled the red version of the iPhone 7, many people didn’t understand why Apple put white bezels at the front of the device. Red and black seem like a good match. That’s why some people even bought screen protectors with black borders to fix this.  This year, Apple is switching to black. It’s interesting to see that Apple waits around 6 months before launching red versions of its iPhones. It could be a way to foster sales in the middle of a product cycle.  The red iPhone 8 is going to start at $699 with 64GB just like regular iPhone 8 models. There will be 256GB versions too. Pre-orders start tomorrow and you’ll be able to buy it in Apple stores on Friday.  For iPhone X users, Apple is launching a dark red leather folio. Apple is also sharing some numbers about its partnership with (PRODUCT)RED. Since 2006, Apple has donated $160 million to the Global Fund through limited edition iPods, iPhones and accessories.

Mr. Giannandrea, a 53-year-old native of Scotland known to colleagues as J.G., helped lead the push to integrate A.I. throughout Google’s products, including internet search, Gmail and its own digital assistant, Google Assistant.  He joined Google in 2010 when it purchased Metaweb, a start-up where he served as chief technology officer. Metaweb was building what it described as a “database of the world’s knowledge,” which Google eventually rolled into its search engine to deliver direct answers to users’ queries. (Try googling “How old is Steph Curry?”) During Mr. Giannandrea’s tenure, A.I. research became increasingly important inside Google, with its primary A.I. lab, Google Brain, moving into a space beside the chief executive, Sundar Pichai.

When news broke Monday that Mr. Giannandrea was unexpectedly stepping down as Google’s A.I. chief, he immediately became perhaps the most eligible tech executive on the market. By Tuesday, it became clear he was never really on the market.  Apple has made other high-profile hires in the field, including the Carnegie Mellon professor Russ Salakhutdinov. Mr. Salakhutdinov studied at the University of Toronto under Geoffrey Hinton, who helps oversee the Google Brain lab.  Apple has taken a strong stance on protecting the privacy of people who use its devices and online services, which could put it at a disadvantage when building services using neural networks.  Researchers train these systems by pooling enormous amounts of digital data, sometimes from customer services. Apple, however, has said it is developing methods that would allow it to train these algorithms without compromising privacy.  On the debate over whether humanity should be worried about the rapidly accelerating improvements in A.I., Mr. Giannandrea told MIT Technology Review in an interview last year that the concerns were overblown.  “What I object to is this assumption that we will leap to some kind of superintelligent system that will then make humans obsolete,” he said. “I understand why people are concerned about it but I think it’s gotten way too much airtime. I just see no technological basis as to why this is imminent at all.”

Q. I have one app on my fourth-generation Apple TV that freezes every once in a while, and the only way I can get out of it is to unplug the whole Apple TV box. Is there an easier way to get back to the home screen?  A. As with apps on Apple’s Mac computers and iOS devices, you can force-quit a misbehaving tvOS program without having to unplug anything. The next time an app freezes, quickly press the TV button twice on the Apple TV remote. When you do, the Apple TV goes into the app-switching mode used by iOS devices, where you see a series of application preview windows on the screen.

With the app’s preview window selected, swipe up on the remote’s touch pad to forcibly close the program.  Photo  Restarting the Apple TV may help stop the forcibly closed app from freezing again. You can restart it from the remote by holding down the TV and Menu buttons until you see the light on the front of the box flash. Alternatively, use the remote to navigate to the Settings app to System and select Restart. (While you are in the System settings, you can also check for updates to the Apple TV’s software or turn on automatic updates.)  The remote can be used to rearrange apps or delete them as well. To move an app, select its icon and press down on the remote’s touch pad. When the icon begins to wiggle, swipe across the touch pad until you get to the spot you want. Press the touch pad again to release the icon. To delete a wiggling app, press the Play/Pause button and choose Delete.

Scott talks about Martin Amis’s “The Rub of Time.” Audio  In The New York Times Book Review, Mark Bowden reviews Matt Young’s “Eat the Apple.” Bowden writes:  Photo  The trouble with writing the unvarnished truth in a memoir is that it requires you to be hard not only on others, but also on yourself. Matt Young’s inventive, unsparing, irreverent and consistently entertaining “Eat the Apple” is that, but it is also a useful corrective to the current idealization of the American soldier — or in this case a Marine. Patriotism and respect for the military is so high in this country that we have lately held a national debate over whether professional athletes should be required to stand for the national anthem. Men and women in uniform are given preference in boarding airplanes, and are so routinely thanked for their service that the expression has become rote. Each new season brings a crop of movies and glossy TV serials dramatizing the heroics of our Special Operations. Young sees hollowness and potential harm in this.  On this week’s podcast, Young discusses “Eat the Apple”; A. O. Scott talks about Martin Amis’s “The Rub of Time”; Alexandra Alter has news from the publishing world; and The Times’s staff book critics, Dwight Garner, Parul Sehgal and Jennifer Szalai, talk about books they’ve recently reviewed.

Ms. Cunningham, who has freelanced for The New York Times, added that she had immediately begun missing Facebook as a research tool for her documentaries. “I don’t know if I can get out of the ecosystem,” she said.  People looking to punish major tech companies by abstaining from their products have been bedeviled time and again by the difficulty in escaping them. After Google fired an engineer, James Damore, for criticizing the company’s diversity efforts last year, hundreds of people on social media called for a boycott of the company. But an analysis of nearly 7,000 tweets using the hashtag #BoycottGoogle since August showed that 26 percent of the tweets came from devices using Google’s Android software, according to Keyhole, a social-media research firm.  One Twitter account named Milton Prescott tweeted on Aug. 8: “Google’s firing of James Damore proves his point completely. I will no longer be using Google for any services. #BoycottGoogle.” The tweet came from an Android device. A message to the account went unreturned.  Even Breitbart is running into the same dilemma. The conservative website is planning to host a panel on how tech platforms like Facebook suppress conservative voices — and it said it would livestream the discussion on Facebook. Breitbart didn’t respond to a request for comment.  Marisa Richardson, a program manager at a life-sciences company, said she began boycotting Amazon recently after learning that it offered the NRA channel on its streaming-video service. So when she needed laundry detergent, she avoided the e-commerce site and instead braved the crowds and traffic — and spent a few dollars more — at a nearby Target.  But a few days later she shopped at the Whole Foods near her home in Oakland, Calif. “I completely forgot that they’re owned by Amazon,” she said.  After the shooting in Parkland in February, gun-control activists called for a boycott of certain Apple and Amazon services because they hosted the NRA channel.  Photo  People used the hashtag #March1NRABoycott to spread the message on social media. An analysis of about 58,500 tweets with the hashtag showed that nearly half came from an iPhone or an iPad, according to Keyhole. Those included popular tweets using the #March1NRABoycott hashtag from the actress Alyssa Milano.  “Had I sent the same tweets from an Android phone, the same issue would apply. There is an NRATV app for Android phones,” Ms. Milano said through a spokeswoman. “We are only just beginning to understand how these companies have infiltrated not only our ideologies, but also our lives in the most in-depth way imaginable.”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Nearly a third of the 4,700 tweets using the #BoycottApple hashtag since August came from iPhones, according to Keyhole.  “I do have an iPhone, but as a customer of Apple’s, am I not allowed to hold them accountable?” Mr. Knight, the activist who used an iPhone to call for an Apple boycott, said in an interview.

View all New York Times newsletters.  Eddy Cue, a senior executive at Apple, recently said that the NRA channel didn’t violate the company’s policies. Facebook, Google and Amazon didn’t respond to requests for comment.  Many of those who recently abandoned their Facebook accounts are still in the company’s orbit, not only with Instagram but also with the company’s popular messaging apps WhatsApp and Messenger.  When Cher recently deleted her Facebook page, she said on Twitter, “2day I did something VERY HARD 4 me.” But her Instagram account, with 768,000 followers, was still active.  Likewise, Elon Musk, chief executive of SpaceX and Tesla, deleted the Facebook pages of both companies — but left their pages and his personal account active on Instagram. The photo-sharing platform, he said on Twitter, is fine “so long as it stays fairly independent.”  Stephen Cox, 39, a woodworker in Los Angeles, recently posted on Facebook that he was deactivating his account in favor of Instagram. When someone commented that the two sites were owned by the same company, he replied, “It’s a double-edged sword, but for me one edge is slightly more blunt than the other.”  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Instagram has proved an effective hedge for Facebook against people losing interest or trust in its main site. While the percentage of American adults who use Facebook has remained flat at 68 percent since 2016, according to a January survey of 2,002 American adults by the Pew Research Center, Instagram use rose to 35 percent from 28 percent over that period. Instagram is also more popular with younger people than older people, according to the survey.  Rayven Bruzzese, 26, a sign-language student in Philadelphia, said she had been a frequent user of Facebook for years but deleted her account in March because she found it upsetting and a drain on her time. Now she spends her time on Instagram.  While she acknowledged the irony of moving to another Facebook-owned service, she said her options were limited. Few of her friends are on Twitter, and many have stopped using Snapchat.  “Where am I supposed to go?” she said. “I wish there was something else.”

Beyond “Planet of the Apps,” the studio has produced “Lore,” a show based on the podcast of the same name, for Amazon, and a remake of the series “Charmed” for CBS. It is also producing content in different regions, including a series in French for Netflix and a series in Spanish for Mexican broadcasters. Propagate is also creating partnerships with the likes of Ms. Paltrow and the singer Zac Brown for more content based on their brands.  “These guys think global from the very beginning, and the formats and shows that Ben and Howard have developed are some of the best examples of customizing content to different markets and cultures,” said Joseph Ravitch, a founder of Raine.  With the new cash, Propagate plans to continue expanding, particularly internationally and in digital content, Mr. Silverman said.  Raine joins A+E Networks in Propagate’s corner.  “This new investment will accelerate their growth and output of content and transform them into a powerhouse indie studio,” Nancy Dubuc, the chief executive of A+E, said of Propagate in a statement.

Government regulation and more restraint from users might also help, but the former is unlikely and the latter is insufficient. So who’s left?  The same company that always seems to turn up when it’s time to cross into a new era of technology: Apple.  I got to thinking about Apple’s responsibility last week when two large investors wrote an open letter asking the company to do more about its products’ effects on children. I was initially inclined to dismiss the letter as a publicity stunt; if you’re worried about children and tech, why not go after Facebook?  But when I called several experts, I found they agreed with the investors. Sure, they said, Apple isn’t responsible for the excesses of the digital ad business, but it does have a moral responsibility to — and a business interest in — the well-being of its customers.  And there’s another, more important reason for Apple to take on tech addiction: because it would probably do an elegant job of addressing the problem.  “I do think this is their time to step up,” said Tristan Harris, a former design ethicist at Google who now runs Time Well Spent, an organization working to improve technology’s impact on society.  “In fact,” Mr. Harris added, “they may be our only hope.”  For one thing, Apple’s business model does not depend on tech addiction. The company makes most of its money by selling premium devices at high profit margins. Yes, it needs to make sure you find your phone useful enough to buy the next one, but after you purchase your phone and sign up for some of its premium services, Apple doesn’t really need you to overdo it. Indeed, because it can’t make infinite battery life, Apple would probably be O.K. if you cooled it with your phone a little.

View all New York Times newsletters.  Yet even though Apple is not part of the ad business, it exerts lots of control over it. Every tech company needs a presence on the iPhone or iPad; this means that Apple can set the rules for everyone. With a single update to its operating system and its app store, Apple could curb some of the worst excesses in how apps monitor and notify you to keep you hooked (as it has done, for instance, by allowing ad blockers in its mobile devices). And because other smartphone makers tend to copy Apple’s best inventions, whatever it did to curb our dependence on our phones would be widely emulated.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Mr. Harris suggested several ideas for Apple to make a less-addictive smartphone. For starters, Apple could give people a lot more feedback about how they’re using their devices.  Imagine if, once a week, your phone gave you a report on how you spent your time, similar to how your activity tracker tells you how sedentary you were last week. It could also needle you: “Farhad, you spent half your week scrolling through Twitter. Do you really feel proud of that?” It could offer to help: “If I notice you spending too much time on Snapchat next week, would you like me to remind you?”  Another idea is to let you impose more fine-grained controls over notifications. Today, when you let an app send you mobile alerts, it’s usually an all-or-nothing proposition — you say yes to letting it buzz you, and suddenly it’s buzzing you all the time.  Mr. Harris suggested that Apple could require apps to assign a kind of priority level to their notifications. “Let’s say you had three notification levels — heavy users, regular users and lite, or Zen,” Mr. Harris said.  Apple could set rules for what kind of notifications were allowed in each bucket — for instance, the medium bucket might allow notifications generated by other people (like a direct message in Instagram) but not those from the app itself (Instagram just sending you an alert to remind you that your high school friend’s mom’s brother posted a new picture recently).  “And then Apple could say, by default, everyone is in the middle level — and instantly it could save a ton of users a ton of energy in dealing with this,” Mr. Harris said.  There’s a danger that some of these anti-addiction efforts could get too intrusive. But that’s also why Apple would shine here; building a less-addictive phone is chiefly a problem of interface design, which is basically Apple’s entire corporate raison d’être.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Another thing that Apple is good at is marketing, and I suspect it could make a lot of gauzy ads showing people getting more out of iPhones and iPads by unplugging from them for a little while. Note that it already sells a device, the Apple Watch, whose marketing extols the magic of leaving your phone behind.  Done right, a full-fledged campaign pushing the benefits of a more deliberative approach to tech wouldn’t come off as self-interest, but in keeping with Apple’s best vision of itself — as a company that looks out for the interests of humanity in an otherwise cold and sometimes inhumane industry.  “How we live with technology is the cultural issue of the next half-century,” said James Steyer, the founder and chief executive of Common Sense Media, a nonprofit group that studies how children are affected by media.  He suggested that the feeling was ripe for Apple to tap into. “It’s something that everyone cares about — whether you’re a Republican or a Democrat, liberal or conservative, whether you live in San Francisco or Biloxi, Miss., you know that you and your kids are part of the arms race for attention,” he said.  Apple released a statement last week saying it cared deeply “about how our products are used and the impact they have on users and the people around them,” adding that it had a few features on addiction in the works.  Apple hardly ever talks about future products, so it declined to elaborate on any of its ideas when I called. Let’s hope it’s working on something grand.

====================================
With the HomePod, we're really reviewing two things at once: a premium speaker and a smart home hub. In the former category, the HomePod is excellent, with amazing sound and incredibly intuitive set-up. But in the latter Siri is only middling in its implementation, and the fact that you're not able to break out of the Apple ecosystem for many key functions also rankles.  Apple’s devices have evolved hugely over the last 15 years or so, changing the brand from the rebooted upstart that gave us the iPod to the consumer tech powerhouse of today.  The HomePod takes the name of that iconic portable device, but a decade and a half on we're faced with the same question posed by previous Apple gadgets: how much of a premium should you pay for owning a device that fits seamlessly into the Apple ecosystem?  Let's not forget that the HomePod is a late entry to the smart speaker game, but that’s standard operating procedure for the Cupertino-based brand: let the rest of the industry stride ahead with a new form factor, identify the issues and then offer something that ‘just works’... and generally for a higher price than the competition.  That’s what’s happened with the HomePod, although not in quite the same way as before. There’s no denying that the sound quality of Apple’s speaker is top-notch, but in a marketplace where Amazon has such an entrenched smart speaker/voice assistant ecosystem and Google isn’t far behind, can a great-sounding-but-imperfect device be worth buying?  The HomePod is understated in the house.  As intimated, the HomePod price isn't a cheap speaker – the price is a weighty $349 / £319 / AU$499, and the speaker began shipping on February 9 in selected territories.  That makes it one of the most expensive smart speakers on the market – and certainly the most expensive mainstream option – but Apple is hoping to justify that price by embedding Siri inside and offering premium-quality audio.  Set-up  By far the easiest smart speaker to set up  Capable of reading own surroundings  It's a heavy box to bring home...  The Apple HomePod is so, well, Apple in the way you’ll use it. As with the AirPods, simply hold your phone near the unit and your handset will send over your Apple ID and Apple Music preferences, and fill in all the long-winded Wi-Fi passwords that you’re proud you remember but thankfully don’t have to type in.  The set-up process was only delayed for us by the fact that we needed to upgrade to iOS 11.2.5 on our iPhone, which is a prerequisite for making the speaker work.  That highlights one key thing about the HomePod: you’ll need to have an iPhone or iPad to set it up in the first place.  It’s hard to see why you’d buy this speaker without owning one of those already, but it trims the target audience down right from the outset.  The speaker glows pleasantly during setup  However, the set-up process does highlight one of the nice features of the HomePod: the glowing light on the top (which turns into the multi-colored Siri logo when you’re issuing commands to it later on).  The whole process is so swift though – compare it to the long-long-long-winded set-up process for the Amazon Echo or Sonos One – and you’ll be so glad that you don't have to spend a minute wafting your iPhone around the room to calibrate the sound levels.  Holding your phone near the speaker calls up this box  Add to that further such conveniences in day-to-day use – if you need to use a new Wi-Fi network that's already set up on your phone, you just literally hold the phone nearby and it's done – and you can see how Apple has smashed the competition when it comes to ease of use, one of its real hallmarks.  The HomePod will actually just work out where it is within the room simply by playing some music – it’ll assess its physical surroundings by hearing how the sound it emits bounces around, and if there’s a wall behind it will send certain sections of what you’re listening to that way, while the main vocals or instruments will fire forwards.  Seven steps and the speaker is ready to go.  If it's not adjacent to a wall then the HomePod will chuck the sound out in a 360-degree space, although in most cases we’d imagine people would use the speaker up against a wall.  After that’s all set up, you can leave the house with your iPhone and your family or housemates will still be able to use the speaker, although you can turn off ‘personal requests’ based on your information if you don’t want other people meddling with your business.  (Thankfully you can also stop requests to the speaker messing with your music listening history – if you’re trying to build decent automated playlists on Apple Music, your housemates playing Justin Bieber and Moana on repeat won’t ruin everything.)  Design  Understated design  Much heavier than expected  If you’re thinking of picking up the HomePod you may want to go with both hands to start with. That’s because this speaker is incredibly dense, packing 2.5kg of weight into its 172mm (6.8-inch) high frame.  It feels a good deal heavier than it looks, and that’s because there are so many speakers in there. We’re talking a woofer and seven tweeters, each with its own amplifier, and six microphones spread around to help pick up your voice when you're hailing Siri.  And once its placement is locked in, you’ll need to answer one more question: how are you going to run the power lead that comes out the back? It’s the only wire on this device, and the only thing that resembles a port too. There’s no other physical connectivity on offer, which sadly means no aux-in port for connecting up a record player or other device.  We do not recommend placing your HomePod in front of a fire for any length of time.  All you’ve got is a squat little speaker covered in an ‘acoustic mesh’ that’s designed to protect the device while letting out as much sound as possible. It looks as unremarkable as you’d expect – there are no decorative flourishes here – and the only break in the mesh is on the top, where a round, reflective disc sits.  This is, as we've mentioned, where the glowing light pulses, signifying when Siri is listening and processing commands, and it's also where you'll find the plus and minus icons for adjusting the volume.  Pushing the speaker against a wall brings the best audio performance.  It’s a shame there’s no haptic feedback from the buttons, but given that most of the time you’re going to be controlling the HomePod with your voice it's not a big deal.  The HomePod isn't the most aesthetically pleasing speaker out there, but it's attractive in its simplicity. Some might think that, for the price, it should be more striking, but the speaker is certainly well-made.  And be warned - the Apple HomePod can leave a white ring underneath if you leave it on certain surfaces (mostly more expensive, porous wood). Apple has acknowledged this and says it should wipe off, or disappear after a few days, but other claims state that it can leave a more permanent ring. Either way, think about where you place the speaker, as the vibration causes a reaction between the silicon base to the wood thanks to the deeper bass.  We had our speaker on a wooden surface in our testing, but it was a thinner (well, cheaper) wood, and found no example of the staining... but it seems that more porous, expensive veneers are those in danger.  In terms of processing, the HomePod is equipped with Apple’s A8 chip, created to be used in the iPhone 6 from 2015. That may sound a little old, but given that it was designed to power a whole smartphone, it’s actually quite a lot of power for ‘only’ a speaker, even one that’s sending and receiving commands to and from the cloud on a regular basis.  Audio performance  Sublime audio performance  No Bluetooth streaming or aux input  The audio quality of the Apple HomePod is, to put it simply, premium. It fills a room easily, with clear separation between all elements of music tracks.  It's certainly at its best when placed against a wall, pulling apart the sounds well, with elements such as voices coming through with incredible breadth.  We're probably all used to hearing music of various quality throughout our day, from poor-quality headphones to whatever speakers our TV has, so using the HomePod will expose a lot of people who aren't audiophiles to new subtleties in music which they may not have heard before.  You can ask Siri to read the news or a message out when in the kitchen if you've got your hands full.  The bass, in particular, is strong, but like most sounds emanating from the speaker the audio is stable, with sharp notes clipping very well. Listening to electronica, in particular, offered a lot of clarity, while bass guitar sounds brought a slight reverberation to the sound – those with an untrained ear in particular will be blown away.  But it's the fusion of all this that's impressive – being able to hear thudding bass (a teeny bit too thudding at times, it has to be said) while at the same time being treated to crystal-clear vocals on top is a lovely experience.  Sometimes you'll feel that things can get a little mixed together – bass guitar can be a touch muddy, or something like a violin can be easily overpowered – but compared to a cheap, low-end speaker the quality is just miles and miles ahead.  The HomePod is loud too, with Siri asking if you definitely want to do that when you ask the speaker to play at full volume. And if there are any sound effects on a track, be it water splashing, rain or a faux-vinyl sound, the crispness again is amazing.  In fact, the audio quality is so good that the biggest criticism we can level at the audio capabilities of the speaker is how you interact with it. Saying ‘Hey Siri’ over and over to achieve anything irks, and if you’re in a room with multiple people talking you’ll need others to shush otherwise their words are easily picked up, leading to random songs being played.  The base of the speaker is on the only place you'll find an Apple logo  It would be nice to somehow have your intentions registered without the need for a key phrase.  Comparing the HomePod to the new Amazon Echo and the Sonos One, though, it bests both of them easily. Leaving aside the simple set-up, which is a godsend, the sound from Apple's speaker is the most expansive and clear... it just feels like there's more information flooding into your ears.  The Amazon Echo is obviously the lowest-quality of the three in terms of sound quality, but it's not terrible. Listen to it in isolation and you'll like how it sounds, especially for the price. But the HomePod just destroys it with the level of audio on offer, making music sound, well, 'proper'.  The Sonos One is understandably much closer to the HomePod when it comes to audio performance, but it's not quite as good – the only way we can describe it is as being 'narrower' in its sound, with the volume and breadth of the audio not matching Apple's efforts.  That's not to say the Sonos One's sound quality isn't hugely clear and evocative – it thoroughly is – but there's just more power and depth from the HomePod.  But now we get onto how you actually listen to things on the HomePod, and therein lies the rub. You need a subscription to Apple Music unless you just want to stream stuff from your iPhone – and even that can only be done using AirPlay.  We say 'only' because you can't stream over Bluetooth to the HomePod. That's not a massive issue if you'll only ever want to play audio from an Apple product, but if you've got something else that can be used to stream Bluetooth music you're out of luck.  Similarly, with no aux input you won't be able to use the premium sound of the HomePod to play your CDs, or your vinyl collection if you've jumped on that particular bandwagon.  We can see the argument for not offering Bluetooth streaming – despite there being a Bluetooth connection on board to enable the HomePod to talk to other smart home devices – but not having an aux input is a missed opportunity.  So, given the above, how are you supposed to get the most out of your HomePod? With the aforementioned Apple Music – meaning you're essentially going to need to pay $10 / £10 a month to keep using your new speaker.  You'll barely use the volume buttons on the top of the speaker.  If you're already paying that, no problem – but if you're currently a Spotify user you won't be able to use that service without streaming it over your phone, which isn't ideal – you can still control the music using your voice in this mode, but it's a lot slower to respond.  The fact that you're pretty much locked to Apple Music makes it all the more curious that Apple doesn't have a lossless format, like Tidal, given that the HomePod is tailored for such high-end sound.  Perhaps that's coming in the future. Or perhaps Apple thinks the sound is good enough with what's there – and as we've said, it is great.  But the fact that you can only use Apple Music rankles, further highlighting how you need to be deeply embedded in the Apple ecosystem to get proper use out of the HomePod.  Speaking of the future, when Apple debuts AirPlay 2 later in the year you’ll be able to link two HomePods together to get stereo sound. We had a brief demo of this, and it sounds, well, pretty much like two speakers making more noise together. The quality was equally as high, just more spread out and that sounded better.  With AirPlay 2 you’ll also be able to spread your sound to other speakers – not just HomePods – and other AirPlay 2-enabled devices around the house.  We tried it with the Apple TV, and while the sound was brilliant we had to dive into the settings every time to tell the TV to play the sound through the speaker. Having two HomePods proudly sitting either side of the screen and automatically playing the audio from Netflix or whatever would be great.

With Apple having confirmed that it’s slowing down iPhones with aged batteries you might understandably be worried that the same thing is happening to your iPad, MacBook or Apple Watch, but you can rest assured that it’s not.  On a support page detailing the ‘feature’, Apple has confirmed that “This power management feature is specific to iPhone and does not apply to any other Apple products.”  So why is the iPhone affected and nothing else? Well, we don’t know for sure, but Apple is slowing older phones down to stop them unexpectedly shutting down, which can happen during performance peaks when the battery is older or at a low state of charge.  Bigger is better  GSMArena notes that as iPads have larger batteries than iPhones they’ll be better able to handle performance peaks, and they also tend to be charged less frequently than a phone, which means their batteries don’t wear out as quickly, all of which means that slowing them down should be less necessary. The same should also apply to MacBooks.  The Apple Watch, with its tiny battery, would presumably be susceptible to the same issues as an iPhone, especially since the battery could wear out similarly fast thanks to the regular charges it’s likely to get, but nonetheless Apple won’t throttle it – at least for now.  There’s no guarantee that the company won’t start slowing down other devices in future though, with the iPhone X, iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus – all of which are currently too new to need slowing down – likely to be next in line.

Thousands of Mac users are crying foul at Apple following the release of macOS High Sierra 10.13.4 having rendered key third-party display products and services useless. Particularly, neither DisplayLink docking products nor the Duet Display Mac app are working in this latest version.  A DisplayLink product manager responded to complaints on its own support forums , confirming that macOS 10.13.4 is to blame for the error, and that it’s working on a fix. This update specifically renders the display capabilities of its docks inert, while other functions remain unaffected.  “In the meantime, we are releasing a new driver [4.3] that will enable clone mode, but not mirror or extended mode displays in 10.13.4,” the product manager writes. “If you require mirror or extended mode displays, we recommend that you stay on macOS 10.13.3 at this time.”  iPad extended displays aren’t working either  Meanwhile, Duet Display – a $19.99 (£9.99) Mac App store program that, for another 20 bucks a month, can act as your Mac’s second display via Lightning cable – isn’t working either. Following the macOS 10.13.4 update, the Duet client app hangs without starting.  Duet Display developer Duet Inc. is advising its customers to refrain from upgrading to the latest macOS so as to avoid the issue, according to MacRumors , as well as contact Apple directly through its bug reporting features.  Worse off is that desktop extension apps, like Air Display and iDisplay, are also reportedly experiencing related issues, also according to MacRumors. The website also cites speculation in said discussions around these issues that Apple’s eGPU support in the operating system update is to blame.  As far as we can tell, it doesn't seem like macOS 10.13.4 has affected external display connected directly to MacBooks through mini DisplayPort or Thunderbolt.  We’ve contacted Apple for comment and will update this story should we receive a response.  Regardless, it’s wise to avoid updating to macOS 10.13.4 if you use any of the aforementioned products or apps to extend your Mac’s display. If you already updated when Apple released the version last week, you can revert to the previous version of macOS using the Time Machine feature – that is, assuming you backed up before updating. Which, you did, right?  Here’s everything we hope for from macOS 10.14

The release of the Apple HomePod is so close now that you can almost hear Siri's sultry tones beaming out of its drivers. But if you're late to the pre-order party, you're now unlikely to get Apple's smart speaker on its launch date.  Initially, Apple had set Friday February 9 as the delivery date for pre-orders of its Siri-powered speaker. But try to order through the Apple online store now and you'll see that date has slipped to between 12 February and 14 February, depending on your territory.  With in-store pick-up options also unavailable, it seems that Apple has underestimated demand for the Amazon Echo rival.  Third-party options  However, if you're desperate to get an Apple HomePod as soon as it's released, you've still got some options.  Third-party retailers are stocking the HomePod, and can often fall under the radar on major Apple launch days. You may not get the kudos of a pat on the back from an Apple Store Genius staff member, but you'll at least likely be able to walk away with the device on its release.  With early reviews for the HomePod highly impressed by the HomePod sound quality, but not Siri's smart capabilities, there's an argument for waiting a little longer for the product to mature anyway. Our full review will follow shortly.

Apple CarPlay: everything you need to know  Years ago, no one minded if their car’s dashboard only offered the most basic of digital information. There was a clock, for example, and if you were lucky you might have even be told what temperature it was outside.  But as smartphone technology improved, drivers quickly demanded more from their vehicles. After all, why should the phone in your pocket have a better screen and more responsive user interface than the one in your car, which cost considerably more?  To their credit, car manufacturers are faced with five, or even 10-year product cycles, so no matter how advanced their infotainment system looks at launch, it is bound to look dated well before the car gets its first facelift.  That’s where Apple CarPlay comes in. Powered by your iPhone, CarPlay gives your car an interface which looks like iOS, but is simplified so it can be safely and legally used while driving.  Are you Android rather than iPhone? Then you'll need Android Auto  What is CarPlay?  In simple terms, CarPlay takes the user interface of your iPhone and puts it onto the infotainment screen of your car dashboard.  This means when your iPhone is plugged in, the car’s own system is replaced by the iOS home screen, complete with app icons and a virtual home button.  CarPlay can be interacted with via whatever controls your car already has, whether that be a touch screen, buttons, knobs, voice or a combination of all of these.  CarPlay doesn’t include every app on your smartphone, because playing PUBG on your car dashboard is clearly a disaster waiting to happen, and some elements of apps are replaced by voice and dictation.  For example, incoming iMessages and WhatsApp messages are read out to you by Siri instead of shown on the display.  The 2017 Hyundai Elantra supports CarPlay for under $20,000  Most cars require you to plug your iPhone into the USB port with a Lightning cable, but some newer models (like the latest BMW 5-Series) now support wireless CarPlay, which works via the car’s Bluetooth connection.  This is more convenient, but you’ll want to make sure your iPhone is sat on a wireless charger if using wireless CarPlay, as it can drain the battery quickly if you’re streaming music over 4G and using the Maps app for navigation.  CarPlay is designed to remove the urge to take a quick look at your iPhone behind the wheel. It’s safer, easier and more convenient - or that’s the idea, anyway.  Which cars support Apple CarPlay?  As of March 2018, there are over 300 models of car with CarPlay available either standard or as a paid-for optional extra.  Some cars bundle CarPlay when you opt for the enhanced sound system, for example, or pick a higher level of cabin trim level.  Other manufacturers charge a premium for adding CarPlay on its own, and the price can vary significantly.  For example, Honda includes CarPlay as standard on some models, and Ford includes CarPlay with its £750 (around $1,000) Sync 3 system in the new Fiesta (along with a larger touch screen and six speakers).  At the other end of the scale, Ferrari charges a huge £2,400 (around $3,000) for adding the software necessary to make it work.  We have included a list of manufacturers currently offering CarPlay at the end of this article. Although it doesn’t include everyone just yet, you’ll be doing well to name a car maker off the top of your head that doesn’t offer CarPlay  Apple CarPlay aftermarket solutions?  If you’re not in the market for a new car, you can still get some CarPlay in your life by installing an aftermarket stereo.  Manufacturers like Alpine, Clarion, JBL, JVC, Kenwood, Pioneer and Sony all sell car stereo systems with CarPlay, as well as other goodies like Android Auto, Bluetooth and DAB digital radio.  The JBL Legend CP100 with Apple CarPlay  Prices start at around £200 ($280, AU$360) for an entry-level unit from a company like Power Acoustik, and go beyond £500 ($700, AU$900) for a fold-out system from Pioneer.  What you need to know about these systems is that car stereos come in two sizes; single DIN and double DIN. Single DIN units are usually two inches tall, while double DIN means a system which is four inches tall.  The former, like the Pioneer AVH-Z7000DAB we referred to above, is a single DIN unit with a motorised screen which folds out of your dashboard. Modern cars with their curved dashboards tend to not cater for aftermarket stereos like these without modification to the dashboard - something which is generally not advisable.  Is my iPhone compatible with CarPlay?  If you’re still rocking an old iPhone with a 30-pin connector, then you’re out of luck; any model before the iPhone 5 does not work with CarPlay. No model of iPad or iPod Touch work with CarPlay.  But it also means a lot of iPhones do - and here they are:  iPhone 5  iPhone 5S  iPhone 5C  iPhone SE  iPhone 6  iPhone 6 Plus  iPhone 6S  iPhone 6S Plus  iPhone 7  iPhone 7 Plus  iPhone 8  iPhone 8 Plus  iPhone X  What does CarPlay look like?  CarPlay is designed to look a lot like iOS. Sure, the home screen background is made black and most of your apps are hidden from view, but CarPlay is still the bare bones of your iPhone.  The main screen shows a selection of apps like Phone, Music, Maps and Messages, along with the time, your phone’s signal strength, and a virtual home button.  As you open and close apps, the most recent three appear at the side of the user interface nearest the steering wheel, making it easy to return to the map, for example, without taking your eyes off the road for more than a quick glance.  That really is the point of CarPlay; it offers access to your iPhone’s core features without distracting you from driving.  That’s why most apps are hidden, and why many employ Siri to read things out rather than letting you read them off the screen.  For example, open the Messages app and you’ll see a list of the most recent people to chat with you, but when you tap on a name Siri reads out any unread messages, or asks if you’d like to dictate a reply.  Notifications appear at the top of the screen as they do on your iPhone, but these are limited to apps which can be used by CarPlay. If your phone receives a breaking news alert from the BBC, for example, it won’t show up.  CarPlay also employs several tricks to make you spend less time looking at it. If you scroll through the artists list in your Music app, the interface will start showing large letters instead of every artist. Scroll until you get to the right letter, then pick the artist you want.  The home screen also shows an app to tap on if you want to return to the car’s own infotainment system.  To adjust the layout of apps on CarPlay you have to head into the Settings app on your iPhone itself (when it isn’t connected to the car).  Tap General, then CarPlay, then the car you want to change the home page of, and move the apps around as you would on the home screen of the phone itself.  Third-party apps compatible with CarPlay:  WhatsApp  Spotify  Amazon Music  Google Play Music  iPlayer Radio  CBS Radio  Pandora  Slacker Radio  Tidal  Audible  NPR One  VOX  Clammr  Downcast  While this should cater for most people’s music and messaging needs, mapping is an area where CarPlay could be vastly improved. Only Apple Maps works, so you won’t be able to access Google Maps or Waze while on the move.  Default iPhone apps on CarPlay:

Except this time, the front of the iPhone is black instead of white. And it looks stunning.  The special edition iPhone will be available to order online tomorrow and in stores beginning Friday, April 13 with prices starting at AED 2,991 for the 64GB model. These prices are identical to other colors that the iPhone 8 is available in.  With a glass back, the red version of the iPhone is more reflective than last year's model but other than the color change, this is the same exact iPhone 8 and ipHone 8 Plus that have been available for a few months. As with other Apple products, part of proceeds for all (PRODUCT)RED purchases go directly to Global Fund HIV/AIDS grants.

The company's first smart speaker sounds great, but is that enough?  Apple HomePod review: A great speaker that's not so smart  For Apple, being late to the smart-speaker party isn't necessarily a sin. The company's ethos -- as explained by CEO Tim Cook time and again -- is that Apple cares more about being the best than being first. The $349 HomePod is proof that's not always true. Apple put considerable time and effort into making its first smart speaker sound better than its rivals, and Chris Velazco argues they succeeded. After a few solid days of testing, he says the HomePod is the best smart speaker he's ever heard -- it's just not all that smart compared to the rivals.  Looking forward to Samsung's version of the talking turd.  Samsung's Galaxy S9 may offer its own version of Apple's Animoji  Sources claim that Samsung's Galaxy S9 will include a "3D emoji" feature that -- surprise! -- counters the Animoji you find on the iPhone X. The smartphone would reportedly use upgraded facial recognition (no word on how closely it matches the iPhone) to create 3D faces that mimic your facial expressions and add a little spice to your messages. The technology would also lead to "more secure financial transactions" -- kinda like... well, the iPhone X.  Someone's angry.

The visual grunt work comes courtesy of an NVIDIA GeForce graphics chip, which will provide extra performance for gaming and GPU-intensive tasks -- certainly a boost over the Intel UHD cards found in ultrabook counterparts. ASUS says it's the world's thinnest laptop with a discrete GPU, and it'll no doubt play a role in bumping the brand's sales of gaming machines.

Bloomberg says that model will also give you a way to summon Siri without having to tap the headphones. You'll simply have to say "Hey, Siri" the same way you do whenever you activate the voice assistant on an iPhone or a HomePod hands-free. Unfortunately, the model meant to be water-resistant won't be ready until next year, at least -- and it doesn't sound like you'll be able to take it swimming. At most, it won't be affected by rain or splashes of water, but it might not survive being completely submerged in liquid.  Considering Cupertino's "other products" category has been doing very well, it's not exactly surprising that it's taking the chance to grow that part of its business. The "others" category, which includes the AirPods, the Apple Watch and other accessories, saw a 70 percent year-over-year increase in revenue in the first quarter of 2018. You may want to temper your excitement for any new AirPod models, though. According to Bloomberg's sources, Apple could still change its plans or experience delays.  They didn't say if the tech titan plans to withdraw existing AirPods when new ones come out, but Apple is known to make older models available at a lower price when it's time to release upgraded designs. That way, it's lowering the barrier to entry and encouraging those on the fence to give its products a shot.

Citigroup said that it lost $18.3 billion in the fourth quarter, its earnings wiped out by a $22 billion charge related to the new tax law, though revenue rose from a year earlier. Without the tax charge, the bank would have topped profit expectations.  Shares of General Electric shed 3.6% premarket. The industrial conglomerate said it expects a $6.2 billion after-tax charge in its fourth quarter after reviewing GE Capital’s runoff insurance portfolio. CEO John Flannery also said the firm will examine separately traded units for its major businesses.  UnitedHealth shares rose 2.2% premarket after the health insurer’s quarterly profit beat analysts’ expectations and the firm raised its yearly outlook, as revenue from both its health care and health care services businesses increased.  Shares of Apple added 0.7% premarket following the news that the iPhone maker and Chinese tech giant Tencent have settled their tiff over tips, allowing users of Tencent’s popular WeChat messaging app to resume giving monetary gifts to their favorite video-streaming stars and content creators.  Alphabet, the parent company of search-engine giant Google, rose 0.7% before the opening bell. Google said it is expanding its sprawling network of undersea cables to plug into new regions around the world, in a bid to speed up its cloud-computing business and catch up to rivals Microsoft and Amazon.com.  Amazon shares were up 1.1% premarket. Data was released showing products carrying the Whole Foods brand helped push sales at Amazon’s online grocery-delivery service, AmazonFresh, up 35% to $135 million in the last four months of 2017 over the previous four months.  Shares of Ford Motor climbed 0.5% premarket after an executive said the auto maker will now spend $11 billion on electrified vehicles through 2022, increasing its previous estimates as it races to catch up on battery-powered cars.  Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. shares advanced 0.8% premarket. CEO Sergio Marchionne said he has no plans to sell its Jeep business or split up the company, cooling speculation but leaving the company’s long-term strategy unclear. Late Friday, the firm issued a recall for more than 162,000 late model Chrysler Pacifica minivans to fix a software flaw that could stall out vehicles while being driven.  Shares of another auto maker, General Motors, also rose and were up 3.4%. The company said it will take a $7 billion non-cash charge following recent tax changes and said excluding the charge, it expects 2017 profits to come in at the high end of its guidance.  Shares of Spectrum Brands Holdings climbed 1.2% before the opening bell. Energizer Holdings Inc. said it will buy the firm’s battery and portable lighting business for $2 billion in cash. Spectrum’s battery portfolio includes Varta and Rayovac brands and generated $866 million in revenue last year. Energizer shares rose 12%.  Merck & Co Inc. shares surged 5.1% premarket after the drug company announced positive late-stage trial results for a lung cancer treatment.  Shares of Blackhawk Network Holdings added 24% premarket to $45.10 following the news that Silver Lake and P2 Capital Partners have agreed to acquire the financial technology firm for approximately $3.5 billion, including debt. The deal values Blackhawk at $45.25 a share, a roughly 24% premium over Friday’s closing price.  Viacom shares declined 3% premarket. TheWrap reported late Friday that Shari Redstone, the vice chairman of Viacom and CBS Corp., is pursuing a merger of the two media companies that previously split.

Among the companies with shares expected to trade actively in Tuesday’s session are Apple, MetLife, Amazon.com, Aetna and Wal-Mart Stores.  Apple shares fell 1.2% premarket following a Wall Street Journal report that the iPhone maker is slashing planned production of the iPhone X for the three-month period ending March 31, in a sign of weaker-than-expected demand for the pricey handset.  Shares of MetLife tumbled 7.4% before the opening bell after the nation’s second-largest life insurer by assets disclosed for the first time the scale of a records mistake that left possibly tens of thousands of workers without their monthly pension benefits. The company said it expects to increase its reserves by $525 million to $575 million on a pretax basis to account for the problem.  Amazon.com, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase said the firms are partnering on a new company to figure out how to reduce health-care costs for their hundreds of thousands of U.S. employees. Amazon was up 0.4% premarket, while Berkshire was down 0.2% and JPMorgan was up less than 0.1%.  Aetna shares fell 2.6% premarket following the insurer’s quarterly sales and profit beats, though revenue dropped 5.6% in the most recent quarter from a year earlier. Other insurers were also down following the announcement from Amazon, Berkshire and JPMorgan. UnitedHealth Group, Anthem and Cigna all dropped at least 5%.  Shares of Wal-Mart were down 1.4% before the opening bell following a Journal report that the retail giant plans to ask suppliers to deliver more goods to warehouses exactly on time or face fines, another step in its efforts to keep inventory low and shelves stocked as it battles with Amazon.  McDonald's shares declined 0.3% premarket. The fast-food giant posted quarterly sales and profits that beat analyst expectations.  Shares of Maxim Integrated Products shed 11% premarket after Japanese firm Renesas Electronics denied a CNBC report saying that Renesas was in talks to acquire Maxim.  Callidus Software shares added 11% to $36.25 premarket on the news that German software company SAP SE has agreed to buy the firm for $2.4 billion to bolster its cloud-computing business. SAP will play $36 a share for the California-based firm.  Shares of Thomson Reuters climbed 11% before the opening bell following a Reuters report saying private-equity firm Blackstone Group is in advanced talks to buy a 55% stake in its financial and risk business for more than $17 billion. Blackstone was down 1.1%.  Pfizer shares were down 1.9% premarket. The drug company posted quarterly earnings and revenue that topped Wall Street expectations and gave an upbeat guidance for 2018, though sales projections for the year fell below some analyst targets.  Shares of United Continental Holdings climbed 1.1% to $66.50 premarket following a JPMorgan Chase analyst upgrade to overweight from underweight and price target increase to $83 from $60.  Harley-Davidson shares shed 6.4% before the opening bell. The motorcycle manufacturer reported its fourth straight year of declining sales and said it expects shipments to decline again this year.

One analyst doesn’t have high hopes for sales of Apple latest iPhones.  Longbow Research analyst Shawn Harrison lowered his rating on the technology giant to “neutral” from “buy” on Wednesday, reflecting the view among some Wall Street researchers that the latest group of iPhones will deliver modest sales performance. He didn’t specify a price target.  “We now forecast only a good, not great iPhone cycle,” Mr. Harrison wrote in a research note.  He said the more expensive price point of the X model may hinder some demand and the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus models have received a “lukewarm” reception, both of which could restrain growth in iPhone shipments. He estimates that iPhone production growth will be in the high-single digits, lower than the consensus view of 10% that he cites.  “Although there are now expanded drivers to AAPL’s business, the iPhone continues to wag the dog,” Mr. Harrison wrote. “Given our change in estimated iPhone growth profile near term, we anticipate this dynamic will limit upside stock appreciation.”  Wall Street analysts have historically been hesitant to bet against Apple Inc., whose shares are up 47% over the last 12 months and 670% in the past decade. Twenty-nine of 37 analysts tracked by FactSet have “buy” or “overweight” ratings on the stock, with an average price target of $192.73. There are no “sell” or “underweight” ratings.  The average analyst price target has increased each month for the past 14, according to FactSet data. Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts, for example, lifted their price target on the stock to $200 from $180 on Wednesday.  Shares were down 0.2% to $175.88 in recent trading Wednesday.  Many analysts have cited factors that could drive the stock higher, such as a tax-code overhaul, which is likely to encourage companies to bring home cash held overseas and could be handed to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. Apple has also seen higher demand for other products such as its Mac and iPad recently.  Longbow’s downgrade appears to be the second among analysts in the last month. Nomura Instinet analyst Jeffrey Kvaal lowered his rating on the stock to “neutral” from “buy” in December and dropped his price target to $175 from $185. He suggested that Apple’s stock has historically dropped after new iPhone models come out, and this cycle appears to be no different. Others have also cited the prospect of lackluster sales recently.

An iPhone X is seen on a large video screen in the new Apple Visitor Center in Cupertino, Calif., in November. Photo: elijah nouvelage/Reuters  Apple Inc. AAPL 0.34% is being investigated by the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission over potential securities violations related to the company’s disclosure of a software update that slowed older iPhones, people familiar with the matter said.  The two probes add pressure on the tech giant to address criticism from customers and lawmakers after it acknowledged in December that it was throttling the performance of older iPhones as batteries aged. The company later apologized for the issue and slashed the price of an iPhone battery replacement to $29 from $79, hoping to win back customer goodwill.  Apple acknowledged in a statement that it is responding to questions from some government agencies, though it declined to disclose which agencies or any details regarding the questions. It also reiterated what it said in December, noting that it has “never—and would never—do anything to intentionally shorten the life of any Apple product, or degrade the user experience to drive customer upgrades.”  The news of the investigations was reported earlier by Bloomberg.  Regulators and prosecutors often open investigations that don’t result in any charges being filed, and securities investigations often take more than a year. It isn’t clear why federal officials are focusing on potential securities violations involving an issue affecting customers.  Generally in such a case, the SEC could try to fault a public company for failing to make timely disclosures about material information that would affect the stock price. The company’s potential liability would probably turn on whether the fallout from poor battery performance was likely to be material and whether the company delayed disclosing it or had the proper systems to detect and account for it.  Apple’s stock has fallen about 4% since Apple’s acknowledgment, but much of the losses have occurred in the past week ahead of Thursday’s planned quarterly earnings report. Some of the declines have come amid reports of possible weaker-than-expected demand for the iPhone X. On Tuesday, Apple’s shares fell 0.6% to $166.97.  Still, some analysts have said the battery issues could hit Apple’s financials. Barclays said in a note this month that Apple could sell 16 million fewer iPhones this year, and lose $10.29 billion in revenue, directly related to customers choosing to replace batteries rather than replace their iPhones.  Apple last week announced it will release a spring software update with a feature that shows an iPhone battery’s health and recommends when it needs to be serviced. Customers also will be able to see if the power-throttling feature is being used on their device and switch it off.  During an interview with ABC News earlier this month, Chief Executive Tim Cook said last year’s update was designed to prevent users from having their phone power off during a call or while taking a photograph. He said Apple made the change to improve customers’ experience and that Apple disclosed the feature at the time, though, he said people may not have been paying attention.  “Maybe we should have been clearer, as well,” Mr. Cook said. “We deeply apologize to anybody that thinks we had some other kind of motivation because our motivation is always the user.”  Since acknowledging it throttled iPhone performance, the company has faced questions from consumer and watchdog groups in France, Italy and China. In France, the Paris prosecutor’s office said early this month it opened an investigation into Apple for potential deception and “programmed obsolescence.” The investigation could lead to preliminary charges or be dropped.  Earlier this month, U.S. Sen. John Thune (R., S.D.), chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, sent Mr. Cook a letter seeking more information on how the company tracked customer complaints of processing performance and whether or not it considered offering rebates to customers who had replaced their batteries at a higher price.  Apple hasn’t commented on the French investigation or Mr. Thune’s letter.  Battery life and processing speeds are two of the most important features on smartphones. To prevent iPhone 6, 6s and SE devices from powering off automatically—something that drew complaints last year from Chinese consumer-protection groups—Apple said it updated its operating system, iOS, to slow certain tasks that required more computing power than a device could provide. It expanded the practice to the iPhone 7 in the fall.  The Apple investigations add to a mounting list of clashes between the Trump administration and tech firms over the past year, including a rollback of internet regulations that Silicon Valley had championed during the Obama era. Tech firms also have run into political trouble lately in Congress, particularly over alleged Russian online meddling in the 2016 election, but also user privacy concerns and liability for online sex trafficking.  —John McKinnon contributed to this article.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks jumped on Wednesday and the Dow closed above 26,000 for the first time as investors’ expectations for higher earnings lifted stocks across sectors.  The Dow also hit an all-time high in intraday trading. It had briefly reached the 26,000 milestone on Tuesday, in its fastest 1,000-point rise to date, before dropping back below that threshold.  The S&P 500 posted a record closing high. It has gained 4.8 percent this year, posting only two sessions of losses. More than three-quarters of the 36 S&P 500 companies that have reported so far have topped earnings estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Outlooks for future earnings are rosy as well, due to the lower corporate tax rates passed in December.  “With any significant policy action, there’s an initial pop in the market, but then it sits and digests it,” said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer of Commonwealth Financial Network in Waltham, Massachusetts.  “Now we’re starting to get earnings guidance ... At that point, the market starts to incorporate it as ‘Yes, this is actually happening’ as opposed to ‘Well, this might happen’.”  The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 322.79 points, or 1.25 percent, to 26,115.65, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 26.14 points, or 0.94 percent, to 2,802.56 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 74.59 points, or 1.03 percent, to 7,298.28.  Boeing (BA.N) jumped 4.7 percent after the company announced a joint venture with car seating leader Adient (ADNT.N) to make aircraft seats.  IBM (IBM.N) rose 2.9 percent after Barclays analysts upgraded the stock two notches to “overweight” and hiked its price target by $59 to $192.  Several companies, however, saw their shares trade lower after underwhelming earnings reports and forecasts.  Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange shortly after the opening bell in New York April 12, 2016. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson/Files  Banks seesawed as Goldman Sachs and Bank of America reported disappointing results. The S&P 500 banks subsector .SPXBK fell in earlier intraday trading but ended Wednesday up 0.6 percent.  Bank of America (BAC.N) was down 0.2 percent after a $2.9 billion one-time tax charge nearly halved its reported profit.  Goldman Sachs (GS.N) fell 1.9 percent after posting its first quarterly loss in six years on tax-related charges and a sharp drop in trading revenue.  Ford (F.N) tumbled 7.0 percent after the automaker reported full-year profit below estimates and provided a downbeat forecast.  General Electric (GE.N) slipped 4.7 percent, extending losses from Tuesday, when it announced more than $11 billion in charges.  Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.85-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.83-to-1 ratio favoured advancers.  The S&P 500 posted 86 new 52-week highs and six new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 107 new highs and 31 new lows.  Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.40 billion shares, compared to the 6.31 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp on Tuesday backed the Justice Department’s request that the U.S. Supreme Court dismiss a case pitting the two against each other over whether prosecutors can force technology companies to hand over data stored overseas after Congress passed a law that resolved the dispute.  FILE PHOTO: An advertisement is played on a set of large screens at the Microsoft office in Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S., on January 25, 2017. REUTERS/Brian Snyder/File Photo  The justices heard arguments in the high-profile case on Feb. 27, but President Donald Trump on March 22 signed legislation that makes clear that U.S. judges can issue warrants for such data while giving companies a way to object if the request conflicts with foreign law. [nL2N1QH0PU]  In a filing with the Supreme Court, Microsoft said it would not oppose the Justice Department’s bid to dismiss the case, filed last Friday, because the matter was now moot. [nL1N1RE011]  “Microsoft agrees with the government that there is no longer a live case or controversy between the parties with respect to the question presented,” the company’s lawyers said in the filing.  Microsoft and the Justice Department had been locked in a dispute over how U.S. prosecutors seek access to data held on overseas computer servers owned by U.S. companies. The case involved Microsoft’s challenge to a domestic warrant issued by a U.S. judge for emails stored on a Microsoft server in Dublin relating to a drug-trafficking investigation.  In its court filing, the Justice Department said it has obtained a new warrant that would be governed by the new law.

The Pentagon opened a winner-take-all competition Wednesday for a multibillion-dollar cloud services contract, dismaying Microsoft Corp., International Business Machines Corp. and industry groups representing rivals such as Oracle Corp., which worry the move will favor Amazon.com Inc.  While companies jockeying for a piece of the business pushed for the use of multiple cloud providers, the Pentagon announced its decision to go with a single company. The department already has difficulty moving information, particularly to the battlefield, and using multiple clouds would “exponentially increase the complexity,” Tim Van Name, deputy director of the ‎Defense Digital Service, said on a call with reporters.  The scope of the Defense Department’s current technology needs -- 3.4 million users and 4 million devices -- hints at the massive size of the award. Chief Management Officer Jay Gibson confirmed that “we anticipate this will be a multibillion-dollar contract,” although the Pentagon hasn’t given an estimate of the project’s cost.  “Whichever one of you wins this, I’m challenging you to bring your ‘A Game,’” Air Force Brigadier General David Krumm, deputy director for requirements for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told industry representatives during an earlier briefing near the Pentagon in Washington’s Virginia suburbs. “This is going to make a difference like few things have to get data to our war-fighters when and where he or she needs it.”  A draft request for proposals issued Wednesday sought industry input for a two-year base contract with options for renewal over eight more years. A final request would be released in early May, with a contract award as soon as September, officials told the gathering.  Artificial Intelligence  Cloud services -- in which computing power and storage are hosted in remote data centers run by a third-party company rather than on-site in locally owned machines -- can range from powering email and storing personnel files to running complex decision-making algorithms. The Pentagon said it’s making the shift to the cloud to strengthen its use of emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence, machine learning and the internet of things.  Having already won two other government cloud contacts, Amazon Web Services is widely perceived as the front-runner for the Defense Department award. Industry groups had called for multiple contract awards, which could improve the opportunities for companies including Oracle, Microsoft, Alphabet Inc.’s Google and International Business Machines Corp.  Chanda Brooks, a Pentagon contracting officer, told the gathering Wednesday that market research shows that multiple companies are capable of meeting the requirements and that the “full and open competition” would result in a single award. Van Name, of the ‎Defense Digital Service, which recruits technology experts from the private sector for stints working on projects at the Pentagon, denied that the department is leaning toward Amazon.  “It’s about the best proposal,” he said. “We have no favorites.”  The industry pushed back on the department’s sole-source position.  Roger Waldron, president of the Coalition for Government Procurement, which represents defense contractors including Oracle, IBM and Microsoft, said “going to a single vendor closes the market to just that vendor for a decade.”  Microsoft and IBM also separately criticized the department’s decision. Microsoft said it was “disappointed,” while Sam Gordy, general manager of IBM U.S. Federal, called the move “flawed.” Google declined to comment, and Oracle didn’t respond to a request for comment.  Scope of Initiative  Underscoring the scope of the initiative, Essye Miller, the Defense Department’s acting chief information officer, said the Pentagon’s information technology covers “over 1,700 data centers and approximately 500 different cloud initiatives across the department.”  Seattle-based Amazon leads the cloud infrastructure market with 44.2 percent, followed by Microsoft’s Azure with 7.1 percent, China’s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. with 3 percent and Google Cloud Platform at 2.3 percent, based on total cloud industry 2016 revenue, according to research firm Gartner Inc.  Amazon already has a cloud contract with the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency dating back to 2013 that’s valued at $600 million. The online retail giant led by Jeff Bezos has the fastest-growing lobbying arm among tech companies and has spoken to the Pentagon about cloud or procurement since at least 2016, according to federal lobbying disclosures.  Oracle’s Stake  Oracle has a particular interest in how the contract is awarded because it has long-term contracts with multiple government agencies that use its flagship database to store information on their own systems. As the agencies look to switch to cloud computing and eye market leader Amazon, these moves threaten Oracle’s traditional revenue sources. Oracle has tried to protect its database business by offering cloud services of its own, but has come late to that market.  Technology companies worried that the Pentagon favors Amazon point to the decision in early February to award a contract of as much as $950 million to REAN Cloud LLC, an Amazon partner, to help migrate its data to the cloud. On Monday, the Pentagon said it was unaware of the award, made by its Silicon Valley-based innovation unit, and reduced the contract to $65 million.  In a statement Wednesday, Sekhar Puli, REAN Cloud’s managing partner, said that “based on the threat of legal action and protest by the old guard, the only winners in this delay are those large companies that stand to lose money if the DoD proceeds with innovation. In the meantime, the cost of maintaining antiquated government infrastructure has not subsided.”  Oracle formally protested the REAN contract in February, saying the company was opening a door for Amazon Web Services and asserting that Amazon pressures clients to use REAN, according to a person familiar with the filing.  Respective Strengths  The companies competing for the Defense Department contract are expected to put their respective strengths on display as they present bids. While Amazon is the leader in cloud services, Mountain View, California-based Google emphasizes its focus on security and Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft touts its ability to move existing databases onto the cloud in stages, while keeping some tasks and data in-house if the customer wants.  The transition to the cloud could threaten on-site database providers such as Redwood City, California-based Oracle and IBM, based in Armonk, New York, that have long supplied government technology products but were later entrants into the cloud market.  “For Oracle and IBM, any government contract feels important. They’re entrenched government vendors," said Lydia Leong, a cloud analyst at Gartner. “Shifts to the cloud and going off of their architecture is not a happy situation for them.”  — With assistance by Mark Bergen, Dina Bass, Naomi Nix, and Nico Grant

In 2012, as Microsoft Corp. was preparing a drastically overhauled version of its Windows computer software, the company's chief executive officer articulated his top priority. "There's nothing more important at Microsoft than Windows," Steve Ballmer said at a tech event. In his typical hyper-excited, semi-shouting style, Ballmer capped his presentation with, "Windows! Windows! Windows!"  That was then. Windows hasn't been the heart and soul of Microsoft for several years, and Microsoft made it extra official last week. In a corporate reorganization, Windows was effectively downgraded in the Microsoft corporate hierarchy. The person now in charge of Windows occupies a lower rung of the organization than his predecessor did and reports to the senior executive in charge of Microsoft's current top priorities: corporate software, cloud computing and artificial intelligence.  It was a bureaucratic shift but one charged with symbolism. Windows is no longer the sun in Microsoft's solar system around which all other planets spin. Windows is an outlying moon -- an important one, but still just a moon. "The future of Windows is bright," Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in an email to employees on Thursday. It seemed like an afterthought.  Windows! Windows! Windows! Microsoft's Windows revenue has remained relatively steady in the last decade, but the software accounts for a shrinking share of total company revenue Source: Gadfly calculations from Microsoft financial disclosures.  Microsoft's corporate reshuffle reflects the company's financial reality. In 2010, the Windows systems for personal computers were the biggest source of revenue for the company, making up about 28 percent of total sales. In Microsoft's most recent fiscal year, Windows was only the third-biggest source of revenue, behind the Office software bundle and a group of technologies for businesses including computer server software, databases and Microsoft's Azure cloud-computing service. Windows' share of total company revenue was just 16 percent after adjusting for Windows sales that the company spreads out over multiple years.  By design, Nadella -- who's been the boss for four years -- has broken sharply from his predecessors, Bill Gates and Ballmer. And nothing signaled that dividing line between Microsoft's past and future more than Nadella's choice to de-emphasize Windows.  The changing focus was clear from his first months on the job. In a 2014 memo to employees that was Nadella's first mission statement as CEO, he peppered 10 mentions of the Windows operating system for PCs into a roughly 3,000 word missive, and not until the 21st paragraph. He used the word "cloud" 21 times.  Heart and Soul Windows was the third-biggest source of revenue for Microsoft last year Source: Microsoft  Nadella's first significant product unveiling as CEO was a version of Microsoft Office tailored to iPads. The software had been developed when Ballmer was still in charge, but it sat on a shelf as the company debated whether the Office app for iPads would hurt Windows sales. Fear of harming the Windows franchise won out until Nadella arrived.  Under Nadella, Microsoft has also made Windows less of a software Big Bang. The entire company used to be organized around developing and releasing a significant new edition of Windows every three years or so. Now, Windows is just another piece of software or app that gets updated continually, like Netflix or Apple's iPhone operating system.  There's less a new version of Windows than many slightly new ones that come out regularly. Microsoft also made those regular updates part of the cost of buying a new computer or signing a contract for a fleet of business PCs rather than paying for a new machine or upgrading the operating system when a new version comes out. It's remarkable how smoothly Microsoft managed a fundamental change to how Windows is developed and released to the public.  Even if Microsoft had kept stressing Windows, the technology world was moving away from it. Personal computer sales have been declining since 2012. Adding up smartphone, tablet and PC sales, Windows software powers less than 15 percent of all the computing devices sold in the world each year. And Windows is nonexistent in emerging areas of technology including driverless cars and internet connected devices for the home.  Microsoft's answer has been to stress areas of technology where it is relevant and has opportunities to lead in the future. That goes back to cloud computing, artificial intelligence and corporate software. All the data amassed by autonomous cars has to be saved somewhere, and it requires hefty computing power to analyze it all. Microsoft wants to be in the middle of all that. The company just won't be there with Windows, Windows, Windows.  This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.

The rapidly advancing area of artificial intelligence will require a new field of law and new regulations governing a growing pool of businesses involved, according to Microsoft Corp., a 25-year participant in AI research.  Companies making and selling AI software will need to be held responsible for potential harm caused by “unreasonable practices” – if a self-driving car program is set up in an unsafe manner that causes injury or death, for example, Microsoft said. And as AI and automation boost the number of laborers in the gig-economy or on-demand jobs, Microsoft said technology companies need to take responsibility and advocate for protections and benefits for workers, rather than passing the buck by claiming to be ``just the technology platform’’ enabling all this change.  Microsoft broaches these ideas in a 149-page book entitled “The Future Computed,” which will also be the subject of a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, next week. As Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft seeks to be a leader in AI and automating work tasks, it’s also trying to get out in front of the challenges expected to arise from promising new technologies, such as job losses and everyday citizens who may be hurt or disadvantaged by malfunctioning or biased algorithms.  “We are trying to be clear-eyed in talking about the challenges,” said Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith, who will sit on the Davos panel and co-wrote the introduction to the book.  Microsoft is working on some of these areas through groups such as the Partnership on AI, which includes rivals like Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Apple Inc. and Facebook Inc. Still, the call for more regulation in an emerging area like AI is unusual for technology companies, said Ryan Calo, a professor at the University of Washington School of Law, who has read the book.  “There are a bunch of players in this space, and if you are Microsoft you want to be seen as trusted,” said Calo, who did not assist the company on the book but has consulted for it on other issues and whose lab is partially funded with donations from Microsoft. Whatever the company’s motivations, the area is an important one, Calo said. “Any sufficiently transformative technology is going to require new laws,” he said.  Brad Smith, President, and Harry Shum, EVP, AI & Research Photographer: Microsoft  Both Microsoft and Calo say the development of new legislation isn’t imminent because the specific needs are still emerging. Over the next two years, Microsoft plans to codify the company’s ethics and design rules to govern its AI work, using staff from Smith’s legal group and the AI group run by Executive Vice President Harry Shum. The development of laws will come a few years after that, Smith said.  In the nearer term, Microsoft is advocating for changes to labor laws to properly classify workers and allocate benefits like health care and retirement planning to people with jobs such as an Uber driver or Postmates delivery person. Smith expects there will be a need for a new category of worker to cover these employees, who are neither full-time nor independent contractors, he said.  “The technology industry needs to engage to change the perception that it reaps the benefits of technology progress at the expense of workers who are displaced or left without protections, benefits or long-term career paths,” the company writes in the book. “Companies that do not acknowledge the importance of worker protections and benefits risk damage to their brands and face the possibility that lawmakers and the courts will step in to impose regulations.”

Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft Corp. and the second-richest person in the world, said there’s a danger that U.S. President Donald Trump’s “America First” approach could damage the U.S.’s influence in Africa in the long term.  Other countries like China are continuing to push into the African continent, and the U.S. should not pull back, Gates said in an interview with Bloomberg News Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait in Davos, Switzerland. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has spent about $12 billion on global health projects in the last five years, focusing on diseases like malaria and tuberculosis.  In “the balance of hard power versus soft power, the U.S. uniquely has a ratio emphasizing hard power and I’d hate to see it go even further,” Gates said. “You don’t want to give up your soft power tools.”  Trump has questioned the value of funding for developing countries, sometimes saying other nations benefit from the U.S. without reciprocating. The president has proposed cutting funding for malaria, though Gates said he’s optimistic that won’t happen.  Gates is stepping up funding for malaria in Central America, joining with the Carlos Slim Foundation and the Inter-American Development Bank to spend $83.6 million over the next five years fighting the disease in that region. Still the core of the organizations’ effort is in Africa, which is at the heart of the battle.  The U.S. should concentrate more on helping the world’s poor, Gates said.  “That’s the area where I’ve chosen to take the wealth that was created through Microsoft,” Gates said. “I understand that money can be very well spent. I’m in there saying let’s keep up the good work.”  After years of declines, the mosquito-borne disease is becoming more stubborn in some countries as different strains of the disease develop immunity against certain drugs. Private companies should keep investing to improve the tools used to suppress malaria, Gates said, even if it’s not a profitable enterprise for them.  “The community needs to get its act together,” he said.

Apple Inc. is preparing to introduce new low-cost iPads and education software next week in a bid to win back students and teachers from Google and Microsoft Corp.  In its first major product event of the year, Apple will return to its roots in the education market. The event on Tuesday at Lane Technical College Prep High School in Chicago will mark the first time Apple has held a product launch geared toward education since 2012 when it unveiled a tool for designing e-books for the iPad. It’s also a rare occasion for an Apple confab outside its home state of California.  A second grader works on an Apple Inc. iPad in Sandy, Utah. Photographer: George Frey/Bloomberg  In Chicago, the world’s most-valuable technology company plans to show off a new version of its cheapest iPad that should appeal to the education market, said people familiar with the matter. The company will also showcase new software for the classroom, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private plans. Apple declined to comment.  Steve Jobs made schools a priority for Apple early in its life. But as the company has driven toward mass-market and higher-margin products in recent years, Google and Microsoft have had success breaking into classrooms with inexpensive laptops and tablets. Last year, the global educational technology market generated $17.7 billion in revenue, according to research firm Frost & Sullivan.  Apple accounted for 17 percent of mobile computing shipments to American students in kindergarten through high school, according to data from the third quarter published by Futuresource Consulting. Devices running Google’s operating systems on Chromebooks or Android tablets held 60 percent of the market, and Windows PCs had 22 percent. While Macs and iPads make up less than 20 percent of Apple’s sales combined, students and teachers are a key market to drive future purchases.  A new, cheaper MacBook laptop is in the works and likely destined to replace the MacBook Air at a price less than $1,000, but it probably won’t be ready in time for next week, the people said. The MacBook Air, introduced about a decade ago, hasn’t seen a major change since 2010, the same year the iPad came out. Although the laptop is popular with college students, it has languished as Apple focuses on more expensive Macs.  Rival laptops have made inroads into the education market lately, a field that originally helped Apple make its name. The sector is prized among industry giants because students learn to use a certain type of device, then head into the workforce and spread the technology wider.  With a recent advertising onslaught, Apple is hoping to capture more young minds with the iPad. The company has revised its tablet strategy over the years by releasing different versions at a variety of price points. That’s helped the iPad business return to growth after multiple declining quarters. Still, demand for tablets is weak. According to research firm IDC, the market shrank by about 7 percent in 2017. Apple grew 3 percent last year and leads the industry with about a quarter of the market.  Apple's Tablet Roller Coaster iPad growth is returning after sales slowed for several quarters  Apple currently offers a slew of different education-related software. The company’s Classroom app for the iPad lets teachers manage Apple devices that are assigned to students for their classwork. There’s also an iTunes U app that lets teachers issue homework, grade assignments and post lessons online. It also lets students complete assignments and take tests. The company offers a software coding curriculum via the Swift Playgrounds app and sells interactive textbooks through its e-book store.  More software is coming. Apple is working on a new version of the iBooks app that’s more in line with the design of the App Store, though it’s unclear if it’ll be shown next week, people familiar with the project have said.  In an invitation to the Chicago event, Apple said it will introduce “creative new ideas for teachers and students.” Having a venue where attendees can see the new technology in action inside a classroom would be a sound strategy for a company that focuses its announcements on live demonstrations.  Next week’s event will also provide an opportunity for Apple to boast about the work it’s doing with Chicago schools. In December, the company partnered with the city’s public school system and City Colleges of Chicago on a coding curriculum for thousands of local students. Apple has also discussed additional education-related programs with the city, people familiar with the talks said.  According to Apple’s website, the school where the event will take place is not an “Apple Distinguished School,” a designation given to institutions with curriculum that uses Apple products and provides iPads to all students.  Apple has tried citywide iPad deals for students in the past, with little success. In 2013, the Los Angeles Unified School District said it would spend $30 million to provide some students with iPads. The deal was expected to become a $1.3 billion initiative to give every student in the district an iPad, but it fell apart.  Such a deal won’t be announced with Chicago next week, people familiar with the plans said. But the city could see more of Apple in the future. According to a recent Bloomberg analysis, the company could be eyeing the Midwest for a major new office.  — With assistance by Debby Wu

In the 1990's, the U.S. only had one purported monopolist to worry about, Microsoft Corp. Now we have at least three, Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Facebook Inc.  It's almost too many to be angry about at once.  Two notable magazine pieces dug into the power of these tech giants this month. Both articles are worth sitting down with when you have some time. Last week, Wired looked at Facebook's handling of Russian meddling in the U.S. presidential election, capturing growing animosity that seems to be coming at the company from all corners lately.  On Tuesday, the New York Times Magazine published "The Case Against Google." The piece recounts how Google crushed a small search competitor and how the European Commission stepped into the regulatory void to fine Google $2.7 billion. (Google is appealing).  The most compelling part is the depiction of regulators' fight with Microsoft: Even though they failed to punish Microsoft in any meaningful way, the media scrutiny, paired with antitrust monitors, had a significant effect on the company's behavior -- simply because employees got nervous.    "Microsoft was so powerful, and Google so new, that the young search engine could have been killed off, some insiders at both companies believe," the author writes. He quotes Gene Burrus, a former Microsoft lawyer: “There was a new culture of compliance, and we didn’t want to get in trouble again, so nothing happened." The piece questions the myth that Google humbled Microsoft on its own. "The government’s antitrust lawsuit is one reason that Google was eventually able to break Microsoft’s monopoly."  But today Google, despite the historic fine it faces, doesn't seem scared. I suspect the company realizes it isn't enemy number one, at least in the U.S. While regulators might have the most legitimate antitrust case against Google, as demonstrated by the EU decision, rising ill-will toward tech giants and their billionaire leaders isn't focused on the search giant. That scrutiny is falling more on Facebook for reasons that have little to do with antitrust violations.  Politicians and others are hammering Facebook for fake content and a broader lack of authenticity. But it's important to note that the company is part of a growing digital advertising duopoly with Google in the U.S. If attention is the new economy online, they dominate our time spent. If it's data about our lives, they have the most of that, too.  And we haven't event talked about Amazon yet. Cities are prostrating themselves at the company's feet, trying to secure its second headquarters. Amazon can do no wrong in consumers' eyes. But if you talk to bankers or business people, Amazon is the one that strikes the most fear in their hearts. It controls more than two-thirds of the U.S. e-book market now. Amazon alone has the stock market's support to enter new industries, drive margins to zero and destroy rivals in search of more scale. It's great for shoppers and terrifying if you're in the grocery or pharmaceutical business.  So if you're a politician looking to quell public concern, or a regulator trying to even the online playing field, what do you do? Do you go after Facebook, the most-derided in the group of late? Do you go after Amazon, whose growth is so staggering that it is responsible for 27 percent of the S&P 500's gains so far this year? Or do you go after Google, a company that makes it easier to figure out where to get the best burrito -- even if that information used to be scraped without permission from reviews at rival Yelp? Or do you make some noise, then end up doing nothing?  This article also ran in Bloomberg Technology’s Fully Charged newsletter. Sign up here.

Microsoft Corp. will start adding new video games, including upcoming “Halo” and “Gears of War,” to a monthly subscription service it introduced last year in an effort to lure gamers from Sony Corp. and Nintendo Co.  Starting with the March 20 release of “Sea of Thieves,” Xbox Game Pass customers will get new titles the same day they hit stores for their $10 monthly fee. Previously, subscribers would have had to pay separately to purchase the games in stores or by download, or wait for the games to be released for a while before they became part of Game Pass.  Microsoft’s Xbox One has lagged behind Sony Corp.’s PlayStation 4 in sales, while Nintendo’s Switch console, which can be used at home and on the go, has been selling out of stores since its debut last March. Microsoft has viewed the success of television services Netflix Inc. and Hulu as a sign consumers are increasingly interested in monthly fees for entertainment content rather than one-off purchases, Xbox chief Phil Spencer said in an interview. The lack of new games in Game Pass was a frequent issue raised by customers, he said.  Phil Spencer, executive vice president of Xbox Business for Microsoft Corp., speaks during the company's Xbox One X reveal event ahead of the E3 Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles, California, U.S., on Sunday, June 11, 2017. Photographer: Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg  “We want to be bold. We want to listen to our customers,” he said. “We've seen Netflix, Hulu, Spotify and others show that subscriptions for media are things customers have become more accustomed to.”  Elsewhere at Microsoft, the company has been trying to migrate Office software users to monthly subscription plans as well, which has the effect of making revenue more predictable and continuous as customers renew plans or set them to re-up automatically. Spencer declined to discuss the financial impact of switching from pricier, one-time purchases of Xbox games to a smaller monthly fee, except to say he’s “comfortable with the economics.”  Microsoft will also start selling six-month subscriptions to Game Pass in retail stores, where they currently only stock one month passes. Electronic Arts Inc. also has a subscription service for its games.

The Internal Revenue Service is providing some relief for companies facing looming tax bills after they stockpiled trillions of dollars offshore free of U.S. income tax.  A timing quirk in the tax overhaul seemed to give companies such as Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Cisco Systems Inc. -- all of which began their fiscal years before Jan. 1 -- the chance to reduce the foreign cash they’ll accumulate this year and lower their taxes. A press release issued by the IRS on Monday indicates that “if done in the ordinary course of business,” the move won’t be considered as tax avoidance, according to Stephen Shay, a tax and business law professor at Harvard Law School.  “The light is green for this planning, not red,” said Shay, a former top Treasury official. “It is great for those whose years beginning before 2018 are still open for the planning.”  While companies taking steps to shift their assets would still owe repatriation taxes, they wouldn’t have as much cash taxed at the higher rate -- "a major concession" by the IRS, said independent tax and accounting expert Robert Willens.  The tax law signed by President Donald Trump in December overhauled the international tax system and requires companies to pay a mandatory two-tiered levy on their accumulated foreign income. Cash is taxed at 15.5 percent, while less liquid assets face a rate of 8 percent. Companies have been trying to figure out ways to reduce assets subject to the higher rate.  Another provision in the IRS release also allows multinationals some leeway when calculating their repatriation tax bills. The law appeared to make more foreign entities owned by multinationals subject to the repatriation tax, but the agency said Monday that taxpayers that own less than 5 percent of a foreign entity’s capital or profits won’t be hit by the repatriation tax.  ‘Pro-Taxpayer’ Notice  Banks and financial institutions will also see a reprieve following the IRS’s guidance that a company’s accounts receivable and accounts payable that are longer than one year will be exempt from the repatriation tax, said John Warner, a tax partner at Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney PC. The financial firms had feared the payments under the loans they issue would have faced the 15.5 percent rate, since they’re generally considered accounts receivable, regardless of their maturities.  "This is generally pro-taxpayer," Warner said.  Still, the agency said it would crack down on some strategies multinationals may use to reduce their offshore tax bills, such as artificially reducing their earnings and profits, cash piles or "pro-rata" share of transactions, for foreign entities they have stakes in, own or control.  Those rules will be a big deal to some companies, said Michael Mundaca, the co-director of Ernst & Young’s Washington National tax practice and a former top Treasury Department tax official.  The IRS also alerted companies not to change their accounting techniques to lower their repatriation bills.

Sales of all devices are stagnating, but the time may have arrived for a hybrid gadget.  Sales of all devices are stagnating, but the time may have arrived for a hybrid gadget.  It seemed like such a good idea, in theory. And it still seems like a good idea -- again, in theory.  Microsoft Corp. and Qualcomm Inc. are pitching computers that mix elements of tablets and smartphones. That means, in principle, people will soon be able to buy a device that works like a familiar Windows laptop but with the slimmer and lighter form of a tablet computer plus the built-in cellular connections and long battery life of a smartphone.  You might be thinking, that sounds similar to an iPad Pro or Microsoft's own line of Surface computers. Yup. And all these gadgets also owe a debt of gratitude to the MacBook Air, the skinny, battery-conserving laptop Apple Inc. introduced a decade ago.  There's a reason I'm curious but cautious about this category of devices that blend elements of PCs, tablets and smartphones. There have been cellular-connected lightweight computers on the market for years, off and on, including devices powered by Microsoft and Qualcomm five years ago. They never caught on. This time, though, these hybrid devices are a category whose time has come. I think.  Powering Down Personal computer sales peaked in 2011 and have declined each year since Source: IDC  Even as smartphones have become the most important digital devices, there has been much welcome innovation in computers. New technology from PC chip king Intel Corp. and Microsoft's 2012 introduction of the Surface spurred fresh ideas about what a "computer" could be.  The Surface has a touchscreen like a smartphone and a detachable keyboard that turns the device into a somewhat compromised tablet-laptop hybrid. Microsoft sold more than $2 billion worth of the gadgets in the six months ended Dec. 31, and some traditional PC makers have found traction with these combo machines, too.  The Surface was followed by the iPad Pro, a similar tablet-plus-keyboard with the heart of a smartphone. Google software supports stripped-down laptops called Chromebooks that have been a huge hit in U.S. schools. These are all relatively recent and welcome reimaginations of conventional computers.  They're not perfect for everyone or every use, but the mixed-up world of computers gives people more choices to find the right devices for them. A PC-tablet hybrid with a fast wireless internet connection is a welcome addition to that stew of options, although there are unanswered questions about the performance and drawbacks of the new machines backed by Microsoft and Qualcomm.  It's also an odd time to be devoting resources to any new type of computer hardware. Global sales of personal computers have dropped for each of the past six years, according to research firm IDC. The research firm's PC data don't include devices like the Surface that have detachable keyboards. Tablet sales are also declining, and smartphone sales have hit a wall. It's not halcyon days for most companies that make computing gadgets.  Hardware Hits a Wall Global sales of computers, tablets and smartphones all declined in 2017. Change in unit shipments from the prior year: Source: IDC  Still, you can see the appeal of trying new concepts in computing. Even if PCs and tablets aren't growth categories, more than 400 million of these gadgets are still sold each year. And each player in the market has its own motivations. Qualcomm, for example, sees greenfield opportunity if it can displace Intel in more PC-type devices.  The big question now is how much of a push the latest cellular-connected PCs will get from their backers. There’s a lot of enthusiasm for the next generation of cellular technology called 5G, which optimists say will usher in a new era of internet-connected devices of all kinds. Intel said on Thursday that it is also collaborating with Microsoft and others to introduce a line of 5G-connected computing devices. The backing of Microsoft, Qualcomm and Intel should bolster the idea of blending smartphones, tablets and computers. That all means that -- in theory -- there's never been a better, and more confusing, time for the "computer" market.

Matt Booty, former leader of "Minecraft," and now VP of Microsoft Studios. Rev3Games/YouTube  Microsoft has appointed "Minecraft" leader Matt Booty to new corporate VP of Microsoft Studios, the firm's internal group overseeing gaming for Xbox, PC, and mobile.  He will report directly to Phil Spencer, Microsoft's highest-ranking executive of its gaming efforts, who himself reports to CEO Satya Nadella.  Booty's job will be to execute Spencer's strategy within the six studios, as part of a company-wide effort to juice up its global gaming strength.  Microsoft has named Matt Booty the new corporate VP of Microsoft Studios, the division that incorporates Xbox and all of its gaming efforts.  As VentureBeat first reported, Booty was one of the key people in Microsoft's "Minecraft" business, and his promotion is crucial to the company's overall gaming strategy and ambition.  Back in September, CEO Satya Nadella appointed previous Microsoft Studios VP Phil Spencer as an executive VP in the company's top board, alongside the people overseeing Windows 10, the Surface brand, the Office 365 suite, and more.  This move had left the position vacant, and Booty is now stepping up to fill in. VentureBeat reports that executives said that this sets in motion a "clear succession plan" for the firm's gaming business.  Spencer, who reports directly to Nadella, will remain in charge of the overall gaming strategy for the company, while Booty — who reports to Spencer — will have to execute that strategy with the help of all the other studios' heads, who will now report to him.  Booty's team includes first-party development houses like 343 Industries, The Coalition, Mojang, Rare, Turn 10 Studios, and Global Publishing. Spencer said that Booty will be in charge of managing and expanding those operations, as part of a larger company plan to devote more resources to its gaming arm.  "I wanted to make sure we had the right organization in place to deliver on our content goals. With that, I made the decision that I wanted to anoint a leader of our Microsoft Studios organization, which if you've tracked it, I've had the leaders of our individual franchises reporting to me for the last three and a half years," Spencer told VentureBeat.  "That's been great in driving our all-up strategy and getting us to the point where Satya was willing and eager to make the investment in gaming that he's made, but it's also become very clear to me that we're going to invest more in content, which we are doing, and that a unified studios leadership organization was going to be critical to our long-term success."

IBM CEO Ginni Rometty Mike Blake/Reuters  IBM is suing its former employee Lindsay-Rae McIntyre, after Microsoft poached her as its new chief diversity officer and human resources executive.  On Monday, a court issued a temporary restraining order which prevents McIntyre from working at Microsoft until further notice.  Using Microsoft's own arguments from a previous lawsuit, IBM is arguing that its diversity strategy is both confidential and "potentially damaging" if shared with its competitors.  Tech companies have a less than stellar record hiring women and minorities. But these companies will apparently do whatever it takes — including launching a legal fight — to hire one type of person: a Chief Diversity Officer.  IBM is suing its former top diversity officer Lindsay-Rae McIntyre after she got poached by Microsoft, in a case that could prove just how important diversity, recruitment, and retention has become for tech companies.  McIntyre, who joined IBM in 2006, was named chief diversity officer of Microsoft on Sunday, after serving in the same role and as VP of human resources at IBM. IBM, in its complaint, argues that McIntyree had access to diversity data, strategies, methodologies and initiatives that are confidential, and that she "will use, rely on or divulge" these strategies in her new role.  On Monday, IBM was granted a temporary restraining order in New York federal court, which prevents McIntyre from working for Microsoft until the court decides otherwise.  "McIntyre was at the center of highly confidential and competitively sensitive information that has fueled IBM's success in these areas," a representative for IBM said in a statement. "While we understand Microsoft's need to deal with mounting criticism of its record on diversity, IBM intends to fully enforce Ms. McIntyre's non-compete agreement to protect our competitive information."  IBM is using another Microsoft lawsuit to argue its case  At the heart of IBM's complaint is an on-going lawsuit from 2015, Moussouris v. Microsoft Corporation. The lawsuit alleges that Microsoft systematically discriminated against women in technical and engineering roles at the company when it came to evaluations, pay, and promotions.  The briefings for that lawsuit wrapped up on February 9. Now it is up to the courts to decide whether or not the case has class-action status.  As part of its non-compete case, IBM is looking to use Microsoft's own legal arguments from the Moussouris lawsuit to make its own point.  In April 2017, to prevent certain information from being released publicly in the discovery process, Microsoft argued that such diversity data is "not merely confidential, but so sensitive and potentially damaging to Microsoft if revealed to its competitors (e.g., IBM), that the court should take the extraordinary measure of putting the information under seal," according to IBM's complaint.  Microsoft ultimately got some of the documents in the case sealed, and others released with redactions.  In its official response to IBM, Microsoft argued that enforcing McIntyre's non-compete agreement is "draconian," as McIntyre has promised not to share confidential information with Microsoft.  It's worth noting that IBM's employee ranks are not a paragon of diversity: According to IBM's website, women comprised 31.8% of its global workforce in 2016.

Glassdoor  Microsoft bought LinkedIn for $2.6 billion in 2016.  The company's enterprise software-as-a-service business is losing ground to competitors and makes up just a minuscule fraction of Microsoft's revenue.  BMO Capital Markets says Microsoft could leverage LinkedIn to boost revenue from its Microsoft Dynamics enterprise software segment by up to 13%.  Microsoft has been losing ground to other cloud computing and enterprise software-as-a-service competitors, namely Amazon, but the company could leverage LinkedIn and similarly aggressive acquisitions to kick the unit into high gear, one analyst says.  "Given that we believe Microsoft feels emboldened with the success of LinkedIn, we think such a renewed focus on SaaS applications could include M&A," BMO Capital Markets analyst Keith Bachman said in a note to clients Thursday. "One area that we think could be a new growth opportunity within the SaaS market is in HCM, or talent management in particular, which would further leverage LinkedIn."  Microsoft purchased LinkedIn for $26.2 billion in June 2016. But for fiscal year 2017, the service brought in just $2.3 billion, or 2.5% of Microsoft's total annual revenue.  The company could leverage the data it harvests through LinkedIn profiles, job applications, and its subsidiary education site Lynda, to power its Dynamics platform for talent management, or HCM, Bachman says. Dynamics made up just 2% of Microsoft's total revenue in 2017, BMO estimates.  "Microsoft has a relatively modest presence in the SaaS applications market segments, relative to both Microsoft’s total revenues and various SaaS market segments. Moreover, we believe that Microsoft is underperforming its potential," Bachman said.  "We believe that total Dynamics revenue could grow by 13% to ~$2.5 billion in FY18, driven by cloud CRM and ERP suites."  Shares of Microsoft are up 11.7% so far in 2018.  Markets Insider

A student tries out the Lenovo 300e, a $299 PC for the classroom that folds into a tablet. Microsoft  While Microsoft dominates the global market for classroom PCs, Google Chrome OS rules the roost in the United States.  Microsoft is teaming up with partners including Lenovo to bring a new line of cheap, sub-$300 PCs to market, to take on Google's low-cost Chromebooks.  Microsoft says that a Windows PC is more capable than a Chromebook — Windows 10 lets you run software like Minecraft or the full version of Microsoft Office.  Minecraft is getting a new chemistry module for students.  Google has all but captured the market for American classrooms — analyst firm Futuresource estimates that in the third quarter of 2017, Google's low-cost Chromebooks accounted for 59.8% of the laptop market for K-12 education, compared to Microsoft Windows devices' 22.3% share.  But Microsoft would be quick to remind you that this doesn't tell the whole story: That 22.3% share is up from 18.4% the quarter before, and Microsoft says, up 4% from the same period in 2016. And, worldwide, Windows still reigns supreme: In that same third quarter of 2017, Windows accounted for 66.5% of global K-12 classroom PC shipments.  Now, Microsoft is striking back against Google's domestic dominance, with a series of announcements designed to make Windows PCs, Microsoft Office 365, and even the Minecraft video game sensation more appealing for education customers at home and abroad.  Chief among those announcements: New laptops for the classroom, priced between $189 and $299, manufactured by partners Lenovo and JP. These laptops will run Windows 10 S, a version of the operating system streamlined for better battery life and performance — at the big tradeoff of only being able to install apps from the Microsoft Store.  Microsoft Corporate VP Yusuf Mehdi tells Business Insider that Microsoft is trying to undercut the price advantage of Chromebooks, which often sell for under $299. But because these PCs can run the full versions of Windows software, including Microsoft Office and Minecraft, they offer "none of the compromises of a Chromebook."  Mehdi gives Google credit where he believes credit is due: He says that Chromebooks didn't actually steal any marketshare away from Microsoft, per se; Google just discovered a previously-unmet demand for low-priced laptops and "made it affordable to have a computer in the classroom." And although Apple has had a strong business in schools, but its products are much more expensive.  A new Chemistry Module for Minecraft: Education Edition will let students play around with both atoms and chemical compounds, in the safety of the virtual world. Microsoft  Now, says Mehdi, the burden is on Microsoft to go out and prove that a Windows machine is more capable than a Chromebook of the same price. Many of the low-cost Windows devices announced on Monday will boast touchscreens and stylus support. Some, will even be compatible with certain virtual reality headsets, a feature schools love, Mehdi adds.  Beyond the hardware, Mehdi highlights updates to the software in the Office 365 for Education suite. For instance, the Microsoft Teams chat tool is getting an iOS and Android app for education users. And Minecraft: Education Edition, which is already widely used to teach programming, is getting a chemistry module for students to perform science experiments in the safety of the virtual world.  According to Futuresource, the time could be right for Microsoft, too: Many schools bought their Chromebooks for students in 2014 and 2015, meaning that they could be looking to do a wide-scale replacement in 2018. That's an opportunity for Microsoft to convince them to switch to Windows — an opportunity he says the company doesn't intend to squander.  "We finally feel like we have a strong value proposition," says Mehdi.

Microsoft is beefing up its Slack-like collaboration software, Microsoft Teams, with the technology-know how and the founder from collaboration software startup Chalkup. Following the hire, Microsoft says it will bring some of the features Chalkup had built to the Microsoft Teams for Education product experience.  Chalkup was founded in 2013 by CEO Justin Chando, who’s joining Microsoft as a result of this deal, and CTO Tim Costa, who left Chalkup in 2015.  The startup offered a classroom collaboration platform where teachers could share resources and assignments with students and could discuss course topics, among other things. The company says educators and students from 1 in 3 universities and 1 in 5 high schools in the U.S. had used Chalkup at some point.  However, with the arrival of Microsoft Teams for Education in March 2017, Chalkup faced a serious competitor – and one that comes bundled with Microsoft Office 365 for Education – for free.  As the two products compete in the same space – collaboration software for educators and students, both Microsoft and Chalkup realized they may do better to join forces.  “In spending time with the amazing people at Microsoft, it was clear that we were completely aligned in our mission for connecting classrooms, sparking student collaboration, and finding new and innovative ways to work together. We knew Microsoft would be a great fit and we’re thrilled for what the future holds for our customers,” said Chando, in the official announcement.  Moving forward, Chalkup says some of its best-loved features will be integrated into Microsoft Teams. However, the companies so far have only disclosed one that’s definitely making the transition: Chalkup’s criteria-based grading rubrics that let teachers give students feedback on their work.  Chalkup’s product is not immediately shutting down, as that would be disruptive in the middle of the school year. Instead, the software will remain available until June 30, 2018. It will also soon add the ability for users to export their course information and move to Microsoft Teams.  Chalkup itself was not a large company – one founder had left, and it had only raised a small seed round, according to Crunchbase. But Chalkup remained online all these years by being very capital efficient, and had built software that was in demand in the classroom, and as an acquisition target. In fact, the company had multiple acquisition* offers, we understand. (Perhaps one was from Google, given Chalkup’s integrations there?)  Investors described the exit to Microsoft as a great outcome, as well.  Microsoft has requested this should not be characterized as an acquisition – only a hiring. However, we confirmed money exchanged hands here, so it’s a bit of hair splitting on Microsoft’s part.  “Justin built one of the first education platforms that students really loved to use,” said Wayne Chang, who had invested in the startup alongside Jeff Seibert. (Both had directly invested, but not on behalf of Baseline, where they are LPs). “And Jeff and I couldn’t be more excited that Chalkup is joining Microsoft and bringing that approach to schools and classrooms everywhere.”  Today’s news follows shortly after Microsoft Teams’ larger product received its biggest update to date. Last month, Microsoft announced a slew of new features for its Slack competitor, including new app integrations, an app store, improved search and discovery features, and new commands.  Teams’ adoption has been steadily growing. Last September, Microsoft said that 125,000 organizations had adopted the software, but didn’t speak to how many users it has. However, Slack had said around the same time that it had grown to 6 million daily users, 9 million weekly users, and had passed 50,000 paid teams earlier in the year.  *Correction, 2/13/2018 1:30 PM ET: Microsoft says it does not characterize this deal as an acquisition; post updated to reflect this.  “Microsoft’s goal is always to deliver the most comprehensive and time-saving products for teachers and believe Justin will be a tremendous asset to help Microsoft bring added value to Microsoft Teams,” a spokesperson said.

After Microsoft signed a deal to test Windows 10 on Xiaomi devices in 2015 and then Xiaomi bought a trove of patents to help run other Microsoft services on its devices in 2016, today the two companies announced another chapter in its collaboration. Xiaomi and Microsoft have signed a Strategic Framework Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to work more closely in the areas of cloud computing, AI (including Microsoft’s Cortana business) and hardware.  To date, Xiaomi has largely focused its mobile phone and wider device strategy in Asia Pacific, where Gartner revealed yesterday that it (and Huawei) were the only two vendors to increase their market shares at a time of general decline. This deal could point to how Xiaomi is looking to raise its game in the West, specifically in the US, especially as it eyes up an IPO that has been reported to potentially value the company at $100 billion.  On the side of Microsoft, it’s particularly interesting given that the company has largely pulled back on a lot of its hardware efforts, and has visibly had some major stumbles in this area especially in mobile — most recently with its failure to take on and grow the Nokia mobile business and Windows Mobile.  It’s also notable that we’re heading into Mobile World Congress, the mobile confab in Barcelona. We understand neither Xiaomi nor Microsoft are planning any news events this year although both have been more noisy in years past.  Understanding that mobile isn’t an area that Microsoft can quite step away from altogether, it seems that the company is going to have one more go now on with a different partner (one that is still on the rise) and a different approach.  “Xiaomi is one of the most innovative companies in China, and it is becoming increasingly popular in various markets around the world,” said Harry Shum, EVP of Microsoft’s Artificial Intelligence and Research Group, in a statement. “Microsoft’s unique strengths and experience in AI, as well as our products like Azure, will enable Xiaomi to develop more cutting-edge technology for everyone around the world.”  “Microsoft has been a great partner and we are delighted to see both companies deepening this relationship with this strategic MoU,” Wang Xiang, Global Senior Vice President and Head of International Business, Xiaomi, added in his statement. “Xiaomi’s mission is to deliver innovation to everyone around the world. By collaborating with Microsoft on multiple technology areas, Xiaomi will accelerate our pace to bring more exciting products and services to our users. At the same time, this partnership would allow Microsoft to reach more users around the world who are using Xiaomi products.”  The deal covers four major areas of services for the two companies:  Cloud support will include Xiaomi using Microsoft Azure for data storage, bandwidth and computing and other cloud services. Meanwhile, Xiaomi’s efforts in laptops and “laptop-style devices” that run Windows will be co-marketed by Microsoft. Then Microsoft is also going to be talking with Xiaomi on how to improve collaboration on AI-powered speakers using Cortana. It’s not clear if this will involve a refashioning of Xioami’s first smart speaker, the MI AI, which was launched in July 2017 for less than $50 and based on its MIUI forked-Android operating system; or a whole new range of devices.  That appears to be just the start for the company’s AI collaborations. They also “intend to explore multiple cooperative projects based on a broad range of Microsoft AI technologies, such as Computer Vision, Speech, Natural Language Processing, Text Input, Conversational AI, Knowledge Graph and Search, as well as related Microsoft AI products and services, such as Bing, Edge, Cortana, XiaoIce, SwiftKey, Translator, Pix, Cognitive Services and Skype,” Microsoft said in a statement.  No financial terms to the arrangement are being given at this time, a Microsoft spokesperson said.  Updated with further comment from Microsoft.

Microsoft today is unveiling new artificial intelligence technology that’s something of an artist – a “drawing bot.” The bot is capable of creating images from text descriptions of an object, but it also adds details to those images that weren’t included the text, indicating that the AI has a little imagination of its own, says Microsoft.  “If you go to Bing and you search for a bird, you get a bird picture. But here, the pictures are created by the computer, pixel by pixel, from scratch,” explained Xiaodong He, a principal researcher and research manager in the Deep Learning Technology Center at Microsoft’s research lab in Redmond, Washington, in Microsoft’s announcement. “These birds may not exist in the real world — they are just an aspect of our computer’s imagination of birds.”  The bot is able to generate a variety of images, researchers say, including everything from “ordinary pastoral scenes,” like those with grazing livestock, to the absurd – like “a floating double-decker bus.”  Microsoft says the bot was trained on datasets of paired images and captions, allowing it to understand how to match up words to images. It learned to draw a bird, for example, when the caption says “bird,” and it learned what a picture of a bird should look like.  “That is a fundamental reason why we believe a machine can learn,” said He.  The drawing bot’s technology consists of two machine learning models – one to generate images from text descriptions, and another that uses text descriptions to judge the authenticity of the generated images. The former tries to get fake pictures past the latter, but the latter doesn’t want to be fooled. Combined, the two work together to create higher-quality images.  In particular, it’s good at drawing images from more complex sentences. While other technology could draw a bird from a caption that said “bird,” for instance, the quality would decline if you told it to draw a bird with a green crown, yellow wings and red belly. Before, this would have led to a blurry “greenish-yellowish-reddish bird,” Microsoft explains.  What’s especially interesting is how the bot can fill in the blanks when specific details aren’t mentioned – basically, it has a little common sense and imagination of its own, thanks to its training data. In the bird example, the bot will usually draw a bird sitting on a tree branch even if that’s not stated in the text, because the images originally fed to it often showed something similar.  According to a recent research paper, this new bot represents a nearly three-fold boost in image quality compared to prior technology, Microsoft also notes.  This isn’t the first technology to combine AI with art, of course.  The intersection of the two sometimes leads to fantastic results, such as when Google’s artificial intelligence drew those trippy machine-generated images that got their own art show. Google also has a neural net that guesses what you’re drawing and an automated drawing bot, and regularly details the research it’s doing in helping machines learn how to draw.  Facebook, too, has worked on teaching neural networks to make small images of things like airplanes, cars and animals, and even creating your own Bitmoji-like avatar from a photo.  Nvidia researchers created computer-generated celebrities, using A.I.  And there have been a slew of recent advancements in this space from others, as well.  For Microsoft, teaching a bot to draw an image from text completes the circle of other work its been doing in this computer vision and natural language processing space.  This includes the development of CaptionBot which automatically writes photo captions, and a technology that can answer questions people ask about images, like the location or attributes of objects – things that can be helpful for blind people.  As to what purpose an AI artist may serve in the real world, Microsoft has some ideas.  It suggests the bot could act as a sketch assistant for painters or interior designers, or could be implemented as a tool for voice-activated photo refinement. (“Cortana, draw a bird,” perhaps?)  Further down the road, He says that, with more computing power, the technology could possibly generate animated films from screenplays to reduce the manual labor required today from animators.  But the technology isn’t there yet.  If you look closely at the images, they’ll almost always have flaws that indicate they were created by machines, not humans – like birds with blue beaks or fruit stands with odd-shaped bananas (see above).  However, with its touted 3-fold improvement, the bot represents an AI milestone of sorts, Microsoft says.

Microsoft continues its steady pace of opening up new data centers and launching new regions for its Azure cloud. Today, the company announced the launch of two new regions in Australia. To deliver these new regions, Azure Australia Central and Central 2, Microsoft entered a strategic partnership with Canberra Data Centers and unsurprisingly, the regions are located in the country’s capital territory around Canberra. These new central regions complement Microsoft’s existing data center presence in Australia, which previously focused on the business centers of Sydney and Melbourne.  Given the location in Canberra, it’s also no surprise that Microsoft is putting an emphasis on its readiness for handling government workloads on its platform. Throughout its announcement, the company also emphasizes that all of its Australia data centers are also the right choice for its customers in New Zealand.  Julia White, Microsoft corporate VP for Azure, told me last month that the company’s strategy around its data center expansion has always been about offering a lot of small regions to allow it to be close to its customers (and, in return, to allow its customers to be close to their own customers, too). “The big distinction is the number of regions we have. “White said. “Microsoft started its infrastructure approach focused on enterprise organizations and built lots of regions because of that. We didn’t pick this regional approach because it’s easy or because it’s simple, but because we believe this is what our customers really want.”  Azure currently consists of 50 available or announced regions. Over time, more of these will also feature numerous availability zones inside every region, though for now, this recently announced feature is only present in two regions.

Over the last few years, Microsoft has launched a number of programs for startups that range from free BizSpark credits for Azure and Microsoft’s developer and productivity tools, to Microsoft Ventures and the Microsoft Accelerator programs around the world. These different programs never quite told a cohesive story about Microsoft’s commitment to startups, though. Now, however, the company is launching Microsoft for Startups, a program that aims to bring technology and marketing expertise to startups and that — maybe most importantly — includes a co-selling program that allows startups to piggyback on Microsoft’s existing sales force.  In addition, Microsoft is tweaking some of its existing programs to better support the startups in its ecosystem.  In total, Microsoft is committing $500 million over the course of the next two years to run joint sales engagements and offer to startups access to technology and community spaces.  But let’s get the bad news out of the way first: The number of credits for startups in the BizSpark and BizSpark Plus program will go down (though not for startups currently enrolled in these programs). Microsoft argues that this isn’t a big deal, though, and that its free offerings are still competitive with those of its rivals.  Charlotte Yarkoni, Microsoft’s corporate VP of growth and ecosystem, told me that she spent quite a bit of time with startups in and outside of the Microsoft ecosystem after she took this new role about a year ago. What she heard wasn’t that startups wanted more free credits — instead, they wanted more help from Microsoft to bring their products to market.  At the same time, Microsoft was also looking for ways to differentiate its startup programs from those of its competitors. “We started building around this concept of helping to broaden the reach for startups and go beyond the typical cloud credits to how we build a different program,” said Yarkoni. “How can we evolve our accelerator program and pull that forward and also think through how we can build more of a campus and neighborhood feel.”  The result of this is Microsoft for Startups, which includes a number of different components. The first is an expansion of the Microsoft Reactors project. These are physical spaces where entrepreneurs, developers, investors and others can meet and where Microsoft hosts a number of different social events and classes. Microsoft currently operates these in Redmond, Seattle, San Francisco and New York. It’s now looking to open new ones in London, Sydney, Tel Aviv, Berlin, Shanghai and Beijing, and Yarkoni tells me that it may move its existing Reactors to larger spaces as their leases come up.  Microsoft Ventures, the company’s vehicle for investing in startups at the Series A to D stage, won’t see any major changes. “Ventures continues to expand and is run by a team that is very focused on our near-, mid- and long-term horizon needs,” Yarkoni said. “That program continues on as it is.”  The largest change will come to the Microsoft Accelerators program. This program is now called Microsoft ScaleUp, and for those startups that qualify for it, this program will now include the option of co-marketing and co-selling through Microsoft’s sales force.  “We tried to build a way to plug our startups into our sales engine,” Yarkoni said. Startups will get all the usual accelerator benefits, including access to Microsoft’s technology and expertise, but in addition, Microsoft is training and incentivizing its own sellers to sell these startups’ tools to its customers. These startups do need to be ready for this, of course, and for the most part, we are talking about B2B startups here that target the enterprise market.  One of the first companies in this program, which Microsoft has been quietly testing for a few months now, is the marketing intelligence platform Affinio. Affinio CEO Tim Burke, whose company went through the Microsoft Accelerator program in Seattle in 2016, told me that Microsoft is not just giving his company a clear playbook to follow, but also providing help with creating collateral like content, case studies and video content. He also stressed that Microsoft didn’t just give him a checklist to follow but that he had plenty of check-ins and meetings with Microsoft to push this ahead. “The unique thing with this is that Microsoft has this down to a science — all the way down to the playbook,” Burke said. He also stressed that he has seen a shift in how Microsoft approaches startups. “You can see and feel the shift,” he told me. “It’s amazing how the organization as a whole has bought in. Everybody knows the goal and direction.”  Affinio, which mostly targets larger enterprises, has already made a sale through this program, with 20 more in the pipeline. The plan is to push more than 100 sales opportunities into this system by the end of the quarter.  This is obviously exactly the success story that Yarkoni is talking about. It’s worth mentioning that this isn’t Microsoft’s first foray into cross-selling third-party products. It also recently launched a somewhat similar program for ISVs, and it’s taking its lessons from this to Microsoft for Startups.  Just as important as this new project, though, is the overall revamp of Microsoft’s startup programs. Instead of the somewhat scattershot approach it adopted a few years ago, it looks like Yarkoni plans to make this program into a more cohesive project that gives startups more incentives to work with Microsoft (and potentially Azure, Teams, Visual Studio and its other tools) at an early stage.  For the longest time, startups have also been somewhat wary of working with Microsoft, which wasn’t always known as being the easiest company to work with. At the same time, competitors like Google have been expanding their work with startups through similar accelerator programs. A bit of competition here is surely going to help founders in the long run.

Windows 10S is, in the simplest terms, Microsoft’s Chrome OS competitor. A spiritual successor to RT, the operating system is a slimmed down version of Windows 10 with added security (by way of locked down app installs) and lower hardware requirements designed to be run on sub-$300 systems that can be purchased in bulk by schools.  The messaging on the software was always a bit messy, though, and the company didn’t really do itself any favors by launching it on the high-end Surface Laptop. This morning, however, VP Joe Belfiore confirmed via Twitter the company’s plans to streamline the offering, essentially reinventing 10S as a “S Mode,” a option baked into the larger Windows 10 operating system.  We use Win10S as an option for schools or businesses that want the 'low-hassle'/ guaranteed performance version. Next year 10S will be a "mode" of existing versions, not a distinct version. SO … I think it's totally fine/good that it's not mentioned. — Joe Belfiore (@joebelfiore) March 7, 2018  The tweet was response to a question about branding confusion, with regard to the education-focused version of the operating system’s market share. Understandably, it’s been a bit difficult to determine how to classify what’s essentially functioned as a forked version of the company’s broader OS.  Belfiore didn’t specify precisely how S Mode will function within the broader operating system when it arrives at some point next year, so we mostly have some leaked info from last month to go on here. The upgrade structure is still kind of confusing according to the earlier info, with the price to upgrade a system either being $0 or $49, depending on which version of the operating system is installed on the hardware.  Hopefully the company will offer more insight into how, precisely, such an upgrade will work, because in its current form, it doesn’t sound like it’s going to do much to alleviate consumer conduction around the operating system.  What seems likely here is the the company will sell systems to schools and businesses who can then opt to upgrade (or not) on a case by case basis.

====================================
The growth of Windows has slowed as Microsoft’s mobile platform goals have faded and the PC market matured. As a result, Microsoft has had to seek new revenue outside of its operating system.  In 2017, as part of that effort to grow, Microsoft announced a new subscription product called Microsoft 365, bringing together Windows, the company’s cloud-centered productivity suite Office 365 and enterprise tooling into a single package.  The introduction of Microsoft 365 presaged the company’s re-organization which, to quote CNBC, “rebuilt the company around the cloud instead of Windows.” This seems reasonable; if Windows isn’t going to return to growth, other services have to keep adding top line revenue. Microsoft’s evolution to a cloud-powered, services-focused company is therefore set to continue.  In the pursuit of new, non-Windows top line, Microsoft wagered that it could expand its “commercial cloud” revenue to a $20 billion run rate by the end of its fiscal 2018. It beat the goal, reaching the $20 billion mark far ahead of the calendar-equivalent date of mid-Summer of this year.  One of those products, Teams, is a component to Office 365 and part of what Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella called a “growth opportunity” that is “a lot bigger than anything [his company has] achieved.”  Today we’re going to explore Microsoft’s current actions in one part of the cloud productivity space through the lens of Teams.  Microsoft Teams  Microsoft’s Teams product is a communications tool often compared to Slack . TechCrunch, for example, recently called the software service “Microsoft’s Slack competitor.” ComputerWorld, in a news item earlier this year, wrote that “Microsoft turn[ed] up [the] heat on Slack” when it announced new Teams features.  It goes on and on, allowing us to comfortably hold up Microsoft Teams as Redmond’s answer to Slack, a company famous for its quick growth, impressive mind share and its independent status from any major tech company. That last fact remains true despite rumored acquisition interest from Microsoft itself, along with pretty much every big company in the sector you can name.  To see Microsoft invest in its own tool that competes with Slack isn’t surprising. There is a large market for the product, and Redmond is loath to let any rival service cut in on its productivity revenue.  Therefore, if there is a hot productivity tool in the market and Microsoft isn’t going to buy it, it might as well build one of its own. Unsurprisingly, the company has been hard at work doing just that.  Joining a big company when you are a comparatively small company can be arduous.  News that Teams could release a free version made headlines. Teams also picked up guest access in February, its introduction of Cortana integration made it into mainstream tech publications and this week Microsoft announced new “retention policies” for Teams.  All that and Microsoft bought Teams a friend this year in the form of Chalkup, a collaboration company focused on the education world.  In short, Teams is adding new features while building its org chart and expanding access. All good things, certainly. However, it was not too long ago Microsoft spent quite a lot of money to buy a different, distinct collaboration tool. What happened to it?  Yammer  Microsoft bought Yammer in 2012 for $1.2 billion, building out what TechCrunch called, at the time, its “Social Enterprise Strategy.” And while the Yammer-Microsoft deal was “great news” for the company and its investors, it also marked the beginning of the “tough part” for the newly acquired startup.  Joining a big company when you are a comparatively small company can be arduous. And if you do so when the larger company is undergoing a massive change in leadership (Microsoft hired a new CEO two years after the Yammer deal) and a business model change-up (Microsoft bought Nokia in 2014, also two years after the Yammer deal, before closing that strategic idea out years later), it’s probably even harder to integrate.  Externally, that difficulty showed. Following the Microsoft deal, Yammer search volume grew before stagnating and later slipping. The product was eventually switched on for free for Office 365 customers in early 2016, four years after it was purchased. Office 365 itself launched a half-decade before, making the moment a bit long in the works.  But all that is the past, and, notably, Microsoft is putting more emphasis on Yammer today than it has in recent years. That may feel odd, given what we just went over concerning Teams.  To dig into that, Crunchbase News got Microsoft’s Seth Patton on the phone, who explained the company’s thinking. According to the 15-year company veteran who now works on Office 365, Microsoft has two separate views for Teams and Yammer. Teams is built for what Patton calls inner-loop communication: stuff for teams, smaller companies and the like; Yammer, in contrast, is better for outer-loop communication: less tactical decisions and more company-wide communications.  The split between Slack and Teams products and the Yammers and Convos of the world isn’t hokum or mere corporate-speak. I’ve worked in newsrooms that used the mix of tools to allow for simple direct messaging between individuals (Slack) and team-wide threaded communications (Yammer). It takes a little getting used to, but it can flow well if you need that level of inter-party discussion.  Even more interesting than the fact that Yammer is not dead is that Microsoft is actively investing in it. According to Patton, Microsoft’s chiefs “doubled down” on Yammer while Teams was being brought into the market in late 2016. This gave Yammer about a year of redoubled investment and attention.  Taking all that together, Microsoft is investing in two communications products at the same time, both of which are baked into its productivity suite. So why the huge push now?  Slack: Software’s favorite rocket ship  You are no doubt familiar with Slack’s growth arc. It’s been a nearly chronic narrative in tech for the past few years. And I don’t mean that in a pejorative sense. (I’m as guilty as anyone else.)  But, in case you have a life, here are some highlights: Slack reached ARR of $50 million in December of 2015. In October of 2016, Slack hit the $100 million ARR mark. Then the company bested $200 million last September. That’s darn quick, and investors took notice, showering the company with cash and ever-rising valuations.  One way to get acquired, after all, is to stick out by worrying the biggest companies in the market through growth.  Fueling Slack’s continued growth is a push into the realm of bigger companies. The firm launched Slack Enterprise Grid last January, bringing enterprise-grade management tools to Slack’s product. With Enterprise Grid, Slack can keep going after bigger accounts. (To that point, IBM has more than 200,000 active users on Slack that use Enterprise Grid.)  That quick growth has made Slack an acquisition target. One way to get acquired, after all, is to stick out by worrying the biggest companies in the market through growth. It’s just hard as heck to do, as incumbent revenue numbers are so large that, well, you have to grow fast to become interesting.  An even bigger scrap  As we know, Slack has rebuffed acquisition offers. As a result, we’re seeing Microsoft, the dominant player in the world of productivity, attempt to slow down Slack in an effort to not lose future users and future dollars. Hell, even Google is in on the race. Its Slack competitor launched for early users in February. Facebook is also tinkering around the edges. It’s fun to watch.  But productivity is Microsoft’s cash cow. For Google, it’s a big side project, but nothing compared to its advertising revenue. That puts Microsoft and Slack more up against one another in the enterprise chat fight.  (In mid-March, Microsoft announced that 200,000 organizations now use Teams, up from 125,000 in September of 2017. That’s 60 percent growth in a half-year or so — a quick growth pace, too.)  What we’ll learn over the next few years is if Microsoft’s enormous enterprise channel can be leveraged enough to slow Slack’s growth, or if Slack’s momentum can actually capture a piece of the productivity market and hold onto it.  It’s a startup against a platform company, a classic enough battle. But with big tech bigger, richer and more powerful than ever, it’s a more relevant business case than we might think at first blush. More when one draws blood or Slack goes public.

In an effort to attract more government clients, Microsoft said it will integrate Azure Stack, its hybrid cloud platform, with Azure Government in the middle of this year. Azure Stack will let government agencies run Azure’s cloud computing platform on their own private servers while retaining access to Microsoft’s cloud services. This makes it easier for clients to protect sensitive data, including classified information, that need to be kept in on-premise servers, and be compliant with data regulations.  Microsoft Azure competes closely for public sector customers with Amazon Web Services, which had a head start because it signed a $600 million deal in 2013 to serve the Central Intelligence Agency, which John Edwards, the CIA’s chief information officer, described last year as the “best decision we ever made” because it allows the agency to work more efficiently and cut costs associated with maintaining legacy software.  Microsoft, however, is intent on catching up with Amazon and both companies have been busy adding services designed for government clients. For example, last fall Amazon announced that it now offers a “secret region” designed especially for the needs U.S. intelligence agencies. Amazon’s reveal of its AWS Secret Region came on the heels of Microsoft’s own announcement of Azure Government Secret, which also supports classified workloads.

Microsoft today launched two new courses in its online education program for developers: an entry-level software development class and an AI course for more advanced developers who want to expand their knowledge of machine learning.  It’s no secret that there aren’t enough data scientists and machine learning developers available to fulfill the current demand. It’s no surprise, then, that a number of large companies have started to teach the fundamentals of these disciplines to their existing employees; starting today, anybody can take the AI courses that Microsoft first developed for its own employees.  The Microsoft Professional Program for Artificial Intelligence is available for free on edX.org, though you can also opt to pay for a certificate. Each course runs three months and starts at the beginning of the quarter. Unsurprisingly, there’s a bit of a focus on Azure and Microsoft’s Cognitive Services here (and you need an Azure account), but otherwise the course is agnostic to the operating system you run.  The overall program consists of 10 courses that range from introductions to AI and Python for data science to a class on ethics for AI developers and lots of hands-on work with training models. Most of the 10 required courses should take about eight to 16 hours to complete.  In addition to the AI class, Microsoft also today announced a similar program for entry-level software developers. This edX-based program consists of 13 courses that teach students the basics of software development, with a focus on Python and JavaScript. What’s maybe more important than just teaching those languages, though, is that the course also looks at basics like data structures and how to use GitHub and other tools to write code professionally.  These two new courses join a growing number of similar programs in Microsoft’s so-called “Professional Program” (why they don’t just call it the Microsoft Academy is beyond me, but I’m not a marketer…). These existing courses range from front-end development classes to a program for cloud admins and a course for IT support professionals.

For Chromebooks and tablets with larger screens, a paid subscription to Microsoft’s Office 365 service is required; the least expensive plan is about $7 a month.  Photo  The Office apps for Android are not the only way to open and edit Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint files on a Chromebook. If you have a free Microsoft account, you can log in and edit files in Office Online, a browser-based version of the suite.  Office-related Chrome browser extensions are available in the Chrome web store, including the Office Editing for Docs, Sheets and Slides add-on, which automatically opens Office files in Google’s own word-processing, spreadsheet and presentation apps. You can also open Office files with Google Docs right in the browser and convert files to either format. Last week, Google announced that Google Drive users could add comments directly to Office files, without having to convert the documents first.

Video  Looking back on nearly three decades in the tech sector, Peggy Johnson recalled how she and other women used to steer clear of leering colleagues by taking the long way to their desks, and how they felt pressured to laugh at inappropriate jokes in the office.  But during a panel discussion on sexual harassment and the role of gender in workplace power, held on Tuesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Ms. Johnson, an executive vice president at Microsoft, recounted with emotion how her daughter, who recently entered the tech industry, has a different attitude.  “She’s not laughing,” Ms. Johnson said.  The panel, created in partnership with The New York Times, took place at a global gathering known more for its extravagant parties and elite guest list than its discussions of gender dynamics. But powerful men have tumbled from their perches in droves since sexual misconduct allegations against the movie mogul Harvey Weinstein were published in the fall.  Elisabeth Bumiller, the Washington bureau chief for The Times, moderated the wide-ranging discussion. Panelists spoke about millennials demanding transparency and accountability from future employers, about social media amplifying and empowering whisper networks and about the need for organizations of all sizes and types to elevate more women into leadership roles.

Q. How long does Dropbox keep previous versions of Word files around?  A. For those with free basic or Plus accounts, Dropbox keeps a complete version history of each file you have stored and edited online for 30 days. If you pay extra for a Dropbox Business or Dropbox Professional account, you get 120 days of version history for your files. (The company no longer sells an “extended version history” option for Dropbox Plus accounts that kept a year’s worth of editing changes to a file.) With any plan, changes made to a file downloaded for offline editing are not included in the version history records.  Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story How Do You Use Tech?

Since joining the administration in early 2017, Mr. Liddell has worked closely with Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, on efforts to streamline and update some government functions. That includes the way the government buys technology or the services it offers citizens online.  Mr. Liddell has his detractors, both in the administration and outside it. Some critics say his record in the administration does not match the prominence of the post for which he is now being considered, noting privately that the Office of American Innovation, where Mr. Liddell is a key member of a team led by Mr. Kushner, has a thin record of achievement.  Others noted that Mr. Liddell had a role in selecting personnel during the transition, an endeavor that has been widely perceived as subpar.  But as a former chief financial officer of Microsoft and General Motors, Mr. Liddell has the sort of experience that could fulfill the president’s interest in someone with a corporate résumé who is also known to his existing staff, according to the officials familiar with the discussions.

View all New York Times newsletters.  Mr. Liddell, a New Zealander by birth, became Microsoft’s chief financial officer in 2005, leading the company through the economic downturn. After joining General Motors in 2010, he helped guide the automaker’s recovery from bankruptcy and execute the company’s return to the public market. He also served as the chief financial officer of International Paper, and more recently, took on that role at the Hollywood talent agency William Morris Endeavor.  Mr. Liddell would also bring extensive management experience from his time in politics.  In 2012, he served as the executive director of Mitt Romney’s presidential transition team, where his job centered on process, not policy. During that time, Mr. Liddell revealed few policy preferences with his colleagues, though he was viewed as an effective supervisor.  Although Mr. Romney lost the presidential election, Mr. Liddell helped write a book on the team’s planning process, “Romney Readiness Project.” The book chafed some on the transition team, who had viewed Mr. Liddell as highly ambitious in the job, and saw the book as trying to claim more credit for the transition than he deserved.  Mr. Liddell’s background and public comments suggest that he could mimic Mr. Cohn’s role in the administration as an ambassador to the business community.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  “We will deal with any businesses that are knowledgeable and can contribute in a way that we think is constructive on the agenda that we have,” Mr. Liddell told a conference of chief executives that The Wall Street Journal held in November. “The message I would give to people is, we’re not there to necessarily deal with every individual company’s every individual issue. That’s not us. We have multiple stakeholders that we need to address.”  “But businesses know that this is an administration that is receptive to feedback from business,” he added. “This is an administration that will listen to businesses of all natures, large and small, of any industry in thinking about policy frameworks.”  In a break from Mr. Cohn and business leaders, however, Mr. Liddell appears more sympathetic to Mr. Trump’s populist trade agenda. After Mr. Trump’s election in 2016, Mr. Liddell told a New Zealand journalist that “I think the days of unbridled free trade and unbridled free markets are over.”  “I worked in the private sector all my life, so I’m a believer in free markets, but not unbridled free markets,” Mr. Liddell said. “And we’ve had 30 years since the mid-’80s, both in New Zealand and here in the U.S. and globally, of basically free markets being driving the whole thinking, the whole rhetoric around governing. I think those days are over, personally. I think we’re going to go through a circular trend of a much more restrained free market.”

marcy79  conversational_bot  Based on actual responses generated by a conversational system developed at Microsoft  Tay said terrible things. She was racist, xenophobic and downright filthy. At one point, she said the Holocaust did not happen. But she was old technology.  Let loose on the internet nearly two years ago, Tay was an experimental system built by Microsoft. She was designed to chat with digital hipsters in breezy, sometimes irreverent lingo, and American netizens quickly realized they could coax her into spewing vile and offensive language. This was largely the result of a simple design flaw — Tay was programmed to repeat what was said to her — but the damage was done. Within hours, Microsoft shut her down for good.  Since then, a new breed of conversational technology has emerged inside Microsoft and other internet giants that is far more nimble and effective than the techniques that underpinned Tay. And researchers believe these new systems will improve at an even faster rate when they are let loose on the internet. But sometimes, like Tay, these conversational systems reflect the worst of human nature. And given the history here, companies like Microsoft are reluctant to set them free — at least for now.  These systems do not simply repeat what is said to them or respond with canned answers. They teach themselves to carry on a conversation by carefully analyzing reams of real human dialogue. At Microsoft, for instance, a new system learns to chat by analyzing thousands of online discussions pulled from services like Twitter and Reddit. When you send this bot a message, it chooses a response after generating dozens of possibilities and ranking each according to how well it mirrors those human conversations.  If you complain about breaking your ankle during a football game, it is nimble enough to give you some sympathy. “Ouch, that’s not good,” it might say. “Hope your ankle feels better soon.” If you mention house guests or dinner plans, it responds in remarkably precise and familiar ways.  marcy79  conversational_bot  Closest match to human speech Closest match to human speech Lower-ranking potential responses Lower-ranking potential responses  Despite its sophistication, this conversational system can also be nonsensical, impolite and even offensive at times. If you mention your company’s C.E.O., it may assume you are talking about a man — unaware that women are chief executives, too. If you ask a simple question, you may get a cheeky reply.  marcy79  conversational_bot    Microsoft’s researchers believe they can significantly improve this technology by having it chat with large numbers of people. This would help identify its flaws and generate much sharper conversational data for the system to learn from. “It is a problem if we can’t get this in front of real users — and have them tell us what is right and what isn’t,” said a longtime Microsoft researcher, Bill Dolan.  But there lies the conundrum. Because its flaws could spark public complaints — and bad press — Microsoft is wary of pushing this technology onto the internet.  The project represents a much wider effort to build a new breed of computing system that is truly conversational. At companies like Facebook, Amazon and Salesforce as well as Microsoft, the hope is that this technology will provide smoother and easier ways of interacting with machines — easier than a keyboard and mouse, easier than a touch-screen, easier than Siri and other digital assistants now on the market, which are still a long way from fluid conversation.  For years, Silicon Valley companies trumpeted “chatbots” that could help you, say, book your next plane flight or solve a problem with your new computer tablet. But these have never lived up to the billing, providing little more than canned responses to common queries.  Now, thanks to the rise of algorithms that can quickly learn tasks on their own, research in conversational computing is advancing. But the industry as a whole faces the same problem as Microsoft: The new breed of chatbot talks more like a human, but that is not always a good thing.  “It is more powerful,” said Alex Lebrun, who works on similar conversational systems at Facebook’s artificial intelligence lab in Paris. “But it is more dangerous.”  The new breed relies on “neural networks,” complex algorithms that can learn tasks by identifying patterns in large pools of data. Over the last five years, these algorithms have accelerated the evolution of systems that can automatically recognize faces and objects, identify commands spoken into smartphones, and translate from one language to another. They are also speeding the development of conversational systems — though this research is significantly more complex and will take longer to mature.  It may seem surprising that Microsoft researchers are training their conversational system on dialogue from Twitter and Reddit, two social networking services known for vitriolic content. But even on Twitter and Reddit, people are generally civil when they really fall into conversation, and these services are brimming with this kind of dialogue.  Microsoft researchers massage the conversational data they load into the system in small ways, but for the most part, they simply feed the raw dialogues into their neural networks, and these algorithms therefore learn from interactions that are very human. According to Mr. Dolan, in analyzing this data, the system learns to perform well even in the face of poor spelling and grammar. If you type “winne tonight drink resttaurant,” it might respond with: “i’m not a fan of wine.” It can engage in a real back-and-forth dialogue, asking for everything it needs to, say, connect with you on Linkedin. And for the most part, it behaves with civility.  Top 25 Responses to “who's Adele?”  When Microsoft’s conversational system receives a message, it generates dozens of possible responses and ranks each according to how well it mirrors human dialogue. In this case, the system knows enough about the world to identify Adele as a singer.  Response Rank she's a singer 1 i don't know who adele is. 2 she is a singer 3 lana del rey 4 i don't know who she is but she is a singer 5 i don't know who she is but she's a singer 6 i don't know, i'm not a fan of adele 7 lana del ray 8 i don't know who she is, she's a singer 9 who is adele 10 i don't know who she is. she's a singer 11 i don't know who she is but she's a good singer 12 i don't know who she is. i'm not a fan of adele 13 i don't know who she is but she is a very good singer 14 i don't know who she is. she is a singer 15 i don't know her name. she's a singer 16 i don't know her name, she's a singer 17 she's not a singer 18 i don't know, i've never heard of her before 19 you don't know her 20 i don't know her name 21 i don't know, i've never heard of her 22 katy perry 23 i don't know who she is but i don't know her name 24 i don't really know who she is but i don't know her name 25 Source: Microsoft  But researchers must also deal with the unexpected. Though these conversational systems are generally civil, they are sometimes rude — or worse. It is not just that the technology is new and flawed. Because they learn from vast amounts of human conversation, they learn from the mistakes we humans make, and the prejudice we exhibit.  Mr. Lebrun estimated that once in every thousand responses, this new breed of chatbot will say something racist or aggressive or otherwise unwanted. Researchers can fix these problems, but that involves gathering more and better data, or tweaking the algorithms through a process of extreme trial and error.  This is a problem for A.I. services in general. More than two years ago, a software developer noticed that the new Google Photos service was identifying black people as gorillas. Google promptly barred the service from identifying gorillas and similar animals, and it has yet to provide a fix.  But identifying and solving problems with conversational systems is harder, just because the scope of these systems — general dialogue — is so large. Image recognition is a single task. Conversation is many tasks, because it bounces back and forth, and each response can affect all the responses to come.  For this reason, Adam Coates, a partner at the venture capital firm Khosla Ventures who previously oversaw the Silicon Valley A.I. lab attached to the Chinese internet giant Baidu, warns that building a truly conversational system is far more difficult than building services that can recognize giraffes, say, or translate between German and French. “There is a huge technical barrier here. We really don’t know how to build a personal assistant,” he said. “It may not be simply a matter of more data. We may be missing a big idea.”  In the short term, many believe, conversational systems will be most effective if they are limited to particular tasks, like asking for IT help or getting medical advice. That is still a long way from a bot that will respond well to anything you say. But Mr. Dolan believes these systems will continue to evolve over the next few years, provided companies like Microsoft can get them in front of the public.

Check Microsoft’s support site for the absolute latest news, but the company previously warned that its updates for Windows 7 and Windows 10 can conflict with certain antivirus programs; users should contact those software makers about updates. Early reports that the Windows patches were causing severe problems on computers with AMD processors prompted Microsoft to temporarily halt updates to many of those systems for a few days. The software fixes are expected to make the computer run more slowly, but Microsoft has noted that newer processors running Windows 10 should feel the least impact.  Photo  The Meltdown vulnerability exists in laptops, desktops and cloud-based computers running most types of Intel processors made since 1995. The Spectre flaw can affect those same systems as well, but also smartphones, tablets and other gadgets running on processors made by other companies, including AMD and ARM.  To find out details for your particular system, Graz University of Technology’s “Meltdown and Spectre” site at https://meltdownattack.com has an extensive collection of links to information about patches from most major hardware and software makers, including several Linux companies. Intel also has a page on its site with links and information about updates.  As for the origin of the names assigned to these bugs, the “Meltdown and Spectre” site has an explanation. Meltdown gets is name because it “basically melts security boundaries which are normally enforced by the hardware.” Spectre’s moniker is “based on the root cause, speculative execution,” and as the researchers note, “As it is not easy to fix, it will haunt us for quite some time.”

Microsoft has started offering a version of its Surface Laptop with Windows 10 Pro pre-installed as a configuration option dubbed the ‘Commercial Microsoft Surface Laptop.’  Currently available only in the US, the options start at $1,199 costs, another $200 more to than the entry-level version of the Microsoft Surface Laptop with Windows 10 S installed.  Windows 10 S is Microsoft’s streamlined version of the operating system (OS) that only allows apps to be installed from its Microsoft Store, whereas Windows 10 (Pro) regularly allows you to install programs you want from any source.  The commercial version of the Surface Laptop also starts with a $200 price hike on account of the laptop starting with 8GB of memory versus the consumer-grade model’s 4GB to start. Then there's the embedded cost of the Windows 10 Pro OS, which is normally $200 on its own.  (If you want 8GB of memory on a normal Surface Laptop with Windows 10 S, you are forced to cough up $1,299 for that and 256GB of storage as well.)  With that, you’re saving 100 bucks on the pre-installation of Windows 10 Pro if you were to install the OS on a Surface Laptop after, say, Microsoft’s newly-extended March 31, 2018 deadline for free upgrades from Windows 10 S to Pro.  Of course, this move seems to be Microsoft getting ahead of that deadline for Windows 10 S users to make the switch – or, rather, upgrade.  What does this mean for Windows 10 S?  Microsoft hasn’t added any new SKUs or plans to offer Windows 10 Pro on the original Surface Laptop, but users can still get free upgrades to Windows 10 Pro until March 31. Whether Microsoft will offer a similar option to general consumers after the fact, or just point them to this new model, is unclear.  Beyond this option in pre-installed OS, there doesn’t seem to be any difference between the two versions of the Surface Laptop. So, it appears that Microsoft is appealing to business customers that need the freedom and versatility of full-fat Windows 10.  What does that say for Windows 10 S? Not much more than reiterating the fact that the OS is ideal for users in education and those that don’t want to worry about all the security of their device – and that’s about it.  This move doesn’t imply anything about the fate of Windows 10 S, but rather refines the definition of its purpose in the scheme of Windows 10 offerings.  But, if you want the incredible look and feel of the Surface Laptop with the full Windows 10 experience, you better grab one before March 31 and upgrade for free. Otherwise, such a setup is going to cost you another 200 bucks at minimum.  These are the best laptops of the year so far  Via MSPoweruser

Microsoft has announced that it will start selling the Surface Laptop in the UAE from March 15 onwards.  General consumers will be able to purchase the laptop from souq.com or Sharaf DG while commercials customers can buy it directly from Microsoft. Prices for the Surface Laptop start at AED 4,199.  Although we don't have prices for exact configurations, based on US pricing, we can assume that for AED 4,199 you're getting a Core i5 with 8GB RAM and 256GB storage. There is a lower config available in the US with 4GB RAM and 128GB storage and we're very much hoping that Microsoft isn't charging AED 4,199 for that.  On the higher end, the laptop can be configured with an Intel Core i7 processor, 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. Again, we'll have to wait to get the pricing on the highest end model.  What we do know is that all four colors will land in the UAE: Platinum, Graphite Gold, Cobalt Blue and Burgundy.  It’s also worth noting that the notebook currently comes with a free one-year subscription to Office 365 Personal, along with 1TB of free storage on OneDrive.

Canonical is planning to make a change to Ubuntu which would mean that the popular Linux distro would collect information (or telemetry data) on desktop PCs during installation and afterwards.  And it’s a move which has immediately been criticized by some Linux fans, as you can imagine, drawing comparisons with Microsoft and Windows 10 which has had an infamously checkered history regarding hoovering up user data.  Will Cooke, Ubuntu Desktop Manager at Canonical, explained that this is happening because the company wants to work on the elements that matter most to Ubuntu users, and the data collected will help the firm decide what to focus on going forward.  That data will include the version of Ubuntu being installed, basic spec of the PC – CPU family, memory, disk size, GPU, display resolution, manufacturer – along with details of the third-party software selected, and time taken for the installation, among other information.  The OS will also gather data on location, although this will simply be the location selected by the user during installation – no IP address information will be collected. In other words, the data collected will be completely anonymized, and transferred via HTTPS for obvious security reasons.  Cooke further explained that some manner of checkbox option would be added to the Ubuntu installer, asking whether the user wants to ‘send diagnostics information to help improve Ubuntu’, but that this would be ticked by default.  In other words, data collection would be an opt-out affair, rather than a decision to opt-in.  Trend spotting  You might be forgiven for thinking this is just a case of a one-time firing off of info post-installation of Ubuntu, but Canonical also intends to install Popcon on consenting user’s PCs – to help pick out trends in package usage – along with Apport to send crash reports (anonymously).  All the data gathered, incidentally, would be made public, allowing everyone to see the percentages of Ubuntu users who use certain hardware.  As mentioned, there has been some predictably negative reaction in the chatter we’ve seen online, with one of the main points of controversy being the fact that the default setting is on rather than off.  Although this is perhaps less of an issue for Linux users than, say, Windows, as generally speaking open source OS devotees are a bit more clued-up as to what they’re doing during installation, and more likely to read prompts rather than gloss over things.  Still, that’s not exactly an excuse for Canonical, and it would certainly look better if the scheme was opt-in, rather than opt-out. Incidentally, if you don’t turn this feature off during installation, you’ll be able to do so later on in Gnome’s privacy panel.  Furthermore, bear in mind that this isn’t going to happen for sure – it’s just what Canonical is planning, so there could be a course change yet.  But if the move does go ahead as planned, it’s likely that the top rival distros, such as Mint, Fedora and Debian, will be rubbing their hands together at a potential influx of new users migrating to a different flavor of Linux. For some folks, even the perception that Canonical is taking some steps down the same road as Microsoft will likely be too much to bear.  Via The Register

If you’re one of the few still holding out hope that Windows 10 Mobile could be reborn as a competitor to iOS and Android… then we don’t recommend you keep reading.  A new wave of experiences, called progressive web apps (PWAs), are being developed to enable app-like experiences through the browser.  These can work on desktop or mobile, but on the phone the experience is particularly important as it allows developers to create something that can work across a variety of devices.  Wrapping it up  Microsoft has been building this support into its Edge browser, and is pretty jazzed about the whole thing , it seems. However, it’s also confirmed that those using the first wave of PWAs for mobile (there are around 10 at the moment) won’t be able to get full functionality, such as notifications.  That’s a pretty serious difference between a native app and the PWA experience, and it’s hardly going to encourage users to make the effort to pin them to their home screen, which is the point of a PWA in the first place.  What's the reason for Twitter not working with #windows10mobile, while some of these do? Did Twitter decide not to include WinMo or is there a technical reason?April 7, 2018  It’s a real shame that Microsoft isn’t currently fully supporting PWAs, because it could have been a real solution for the lack of apps that’s blighted the Windows Mobile program for years - it’s not certain that it never will, so perhaps one day things could be rosier.  It would be unfair to take a single tweet as confirmation that Microsoft has decided for certain that it won't improve the PWA experience on mobile, so it could all change.  But there’s very little evidence out there that Microsoft is willing to put in the massive effort needed to get back on terms with iOS and Android devices, even in the enterprise sector, so the future doesn’t look too rosy at the moment.  Don't worry Microsofties - the best laptops run Windows 10.

Microsoft has long been looking at ways to merge the physical world with the digital one, such as its Hololens and Windows Mixed Reality headsets, and now it's revealed Project Zanzibar, potentially its most exciting attempt yet.  Project Zanzibar is a portable mat that comes with NFC (near field communication) functionality – the same technology that allows you to quickly pay in shops and restaurants by tapping your smartphone on a payment device.  The mat also has capacitive sensing to detect multi-touch gestures and movement, allowing it to identify physical objects placed on it.  In a blog post detailing the project, the research team behind it explained where their inspiration came from. “We began with a simple thought," they explained. "What if we could blur the divide between the physical and digital worlds? What if you could play with toys and cards and blocks, while watching your actions come alive onscreen?”  Image credit: Microsoft  Play time  The blog also outlines some potential uses for Project Zanzibar, which the team envisions could drastically change the way we interact with PCs.  Playing with toys is one such example. Standard toys could be placed on the mat and given globally unique IDs, enabling data to be stored for each object.  While combining physical toys with NFC chips and augmented reality is nothing new (the popular Skylanders, Lego Dimensions and Nintendo’s Amiibo toys all use variations of the technology), what’s exciting about Project Zanzibar is that it can work with any off-the-shelf toy, not just specially made (and expensive) figurines.  In tests, kids played with the toys on the mat, using a tablet running a movie making app to create stop-motion videos.  As the blog explains: “Project Zanzibar invites children to bring their toys into an interactive experience and watch them come alive through sound, visuals and special effects. The team had observed kids spending hours making stop-action movies to share online.”  The mat can also detect the location of toys on the mat, and by sensing where certain toys are, and if they are near other toys, can broadcast lines of dialog, telling a story as the children play.  While some people may be concerned that Project Zanzibar is aiming to stop kids using their imaginations when playing, and instead use a computer to create sounds and special effects, the researchers claim to be taking a different angle by changing how children interact with PCs.  Many kids spend more time interacting with a 2D screen than playing with physical toys, and the Project Zanzibar team want to change this.  As Haiyan Zhang, a Project Zanzibar researcher, says: “The physical world is such a rich place, abundant with dimensionality and materiality. Our vision is to tap into that richness and imbue it with that digital magic and our hope is that Project Zanzibar is a step in that direction.”  Image credit: Microsoft  Help with learning  The team is also keen to stress the teaching possibilities of Project Zanzibar, inspired by the Montessori Method, a theory developed in the early 20th century by Maria Montessori, which looked at how important physical activity is for helping children to learn. “We took traditional Montessori exercises for young children and extended them with digital content and feedback using Project Zanzibar,” the blog explains.  The team is also looking at creating a range of educational apps, which include spelling and coding lessons, that use physical cards and allow the children to use natural, tactile, actions to interact with the apps.  How does it work?  The blog also delves into how the Project Zanzibar prototype works, including how the NFC technology can detect the position of objects, and how the mat can be rolled up to be easily portable. It can also detect when objects are stacked on each other and in which order, which is all pretty clever.  Items don’t need to be placed directly on the mat, which can detect NFC objects from 30mm above. It can also recognize gestures made above the mat, such as drawing shapes in the air. The mat connects to a computer via USB or Bluetooth.  The team has released a technical paper providing even more information about the project.  It’s all pretty exciting stuff, and we’re looking forward to seeing the fruits of Project Zanzibar’s labors. If it lives up to its potential, it really could change the way we – and our children – interact with computers.

When it comes to big-name exclusive games, Microsoft is lagging somewhat. While Sony has Spider-Man, The Last of Us Part 2, God of War, Dreams and others lined up for 2018, Microsoft has Crackdown 3, State of Decay 2, and Sea of Thieves on the horizon.  These titles may look promising and we know there are unannounced games in the works – those Fable 4 rumors are still going strong – but Microsoft isn’t looking as comprehensive on the exclusives front at the moment.  If Microsoft wants to remain competitive with Sony and Nintendo, it needs to do something about its sparse offering of console-selling first-party titles, and it’s acknowledged this in the past. If a recent report from Polygon is anything to go by, making some big acquisitions is the fastest and most likely solution.  Pay-to-win  Speaking to four industry analysts, Polygon is reporting that major publisher acquisitions are the “most likely” route for Microsoft, given that the company is short on time and internal studios, but sitting on a reasonably large cash pot.  Citing an anonymous but “reliable” source “close to Microsoft”, Polygon reports that Electronic Arts is one of the publishers being considered. Other rumors have suggested that Valve and PUBG Corp are also being looked at.  Given Microsoft’s recent timed exclusive deal with PUBG Corp, it wouldn’t be too outlandish for the company to want to tie its ever-growing game PUBG to Xbox and PC on a more permanent basis.  Acquiring EA would be a much more bold move, but it would significantly boost Microsoft’s software division and both companies appear to share the belief that games as a service is the way forward for the industry.  Certainly, the Xbox Game Pass service would truly become the true Netflix of games if it was able to boast titles from third-parties.  Though acquisitions do seem like a plausible and beneficial move for Microsoft at the moment, these rumors remain nothing more than rumors and Microsoft is yet to confirm any plans yet.

Microsoft has bought gaming startup PlayFab, which is a platform for developers to build, launch and grow their cloud-based games.  PlayFab’s platform reduces the barriers many developers face when launching cloud-based games, serving up solutions that can grow as their games do. Importantly, it doesn’t just help developers bring games to market, but also helps them engage with and retain players in the long run.  To date, the platform has been behind a number of successful games, including Angry Birds Seasons and Bad Piggies.  Although no details have yet been released about how the acquisition will affect the day-to-day running of PlayFab, in the official announcement on the Microsoft Blog , Kareem Choudhry, Corporate Vice President of Gaming at Microsoft, says the acquisition is part of the company’s ongoing investment to bolster Microsoft Azure and create a solid, cloud-based platform for the gaming industry.  Choudhry notes that more than one billion people are playing games, and that increasingly the industry is moving its efforts to the cloud – but that while this makes sense for security and access to gamers, it isn’t all smooth sailing.  “The cost and complexity of achieving this through custom-built, server-side tools and technologies is high,” Choudhry notes, “PlayFab offers developers a compelling model that scales naturally with their games’ players.”

Over the past few years Microsoft has worked hard at increasing transparency with its Xbox fanbase, and its next step in improving this dialogue is to launch a new Xbox-focused web series called Inside Xbox.  The first episode will be shown on Saturday March 10 at 12pm PT/ 3pm ET/ 8pm GMT across a host of streaming services including including Mixer.com/Xbox, YouTube.com/Xbox, Twitch.TV/Xbox, and Facebook.com/Xbox.  In episode one the focus will be on Sea of Thieves, Xbox’s next big exclusive coming on March 20. The hosts – including Larry Hryb, Graeme Boyd, Jeff Rubenstein, Alex Hebert, Lydia Ellery, and more – will be sitting down with Sea of Thieves studio Rare to go behind the scenes of the game and discuss what fans can expect at launch.  An inside look  The entire show won’t focus on Sea of Thieves though, there will also be Game Pass news, information on new console features and discussions around PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds as well as Far Cry 5.  There’ll also be a community desk segment dedicated to fans watching with prizes and giveaways for those that join in the conversation using #insidexbox.  This isn’t the first time Xbox has tried out a show like this; back in 2012 it tried a show of the same name with a similar premise that didn’t work out. The environment around streams and online gaming is different now than it was then, and given the success of Nintendo’s Direct series the time is probably right for Xbox to try again.  Microsoft didn’t release any kind of regular schedule for the show, but it did say in the announcement it hope to see Inside Xbox become a regular monthly event.

Microsoft has straight-up confirmed to Thurrott that it’s working on a successor to the Surface Hub digital whiteboard released back in 2016, presumably known as ‘Surface Hub 2.’  A would-be Surface Hub 2 has been the subject of rumors and speculation for sometime, known internally at Microsoft as ‘Aruba’, Thurrott reports. According to the outlet, the firm plans to formally announce the new digital whiteboard in the first half of this year – so, before the end of June, we can only assume. Frankly, a Build 2018 debut would be a safe bet.  “Surface Hub created an entirely new device category and we’re thrilled with the strong momentum we have seen across the globe,” a Microsoft spokesperson told Thurrott. “We’re working on V2 and will share more in the first half of this year.”  Furthermore, the outlet reports that this ‘V2’ will bring upgraded hardware and software – like native Teams chat integration – alike to the product, the latter of which will be enjoyed by the original model.  [Editor's Note: A previous version of this story erroneously noted that Microsoft had told Thurrott that it will not be able to meet this newfound demand for the follow-up product in 2018 on account of the sheer scale of production required. We've since corrected and apologize for the error.]  Unsurprisingly, Microsoft is doubling down on its big digital whiteboard experiment because it has reportedly attracted more than 5,000 customers worldwide across various professional fields. However, a Microsoft representative has informed informed that it "has seen very strong demand for the current generation of Surface Hub, and expects that demand will begin to outpace supply over the course of this calendar year."  Hence the fact that Microsoft plans to bring the Surface Hub 2’s new software features to the original model, likely through an over-the-air update in much the same way it updates its other Surface products with specific software and firmware.  Here’s to hoping we’ll see the Surface Hub 2 debut bring down the price of the original model, so as to allow more small-to-medium businesses and schools especially get in on the advancements it brings to those groups.

"Microsoft applications including Office, OneDrive, Cortana and Outlook do not come preinstalled, but when you purchase from a Microsoft Store, our experts can personalize the device with Microsoft's productivity applications so every customer is able to work, play and connect on their device when they leave." In other words, Microsoft would be happy to kit out your shiny new S9, or you could just leave with your hard-won phone and learn to live a life with Bixby.  If you'd like to reserve one of these phones, you can pre-order a unit starting today. Delivery will begin on March 16th, but Microsoft notes that quantities are limited.

Microsoft knows its list of Xbox-exclusive games leaves something to be desired, and it's committing more resources to that area. Booty's new role helps create a unified leadership structure that theoretically helps the studios move more quickly and produce more of those desirable titles. The role covers mobile and PC titles by extension, so it won't be shocking if there are more coordinated multi-platform releases at the same time.  There's no certainty that Microsoft will enjoy a renaissance, and you probably won't see the results of this executive shuffle for quite some time. Should it work as promised, though, it could lead to faster turnaround times for games and more projects. That won't solve all of the Xbox One's library problems, as one of Microsoft's biggest challenges is convincing others to create Xbox-only titles. It might, however, reduce the company's dependence on third parties.

It may seem odd to target versions of Android that stopped receiving support years ago, especially when Android Go promises to make the latest operating system more accessible. However, Microsoft is acknowledging a practical reality: many people in developing countries can't necessarily justify updating their phones every couple of years, and might even buy phones still running old Android versions. Google's February 2018 platform stats showed 42 percent of Android devices on Google Play running some version of Android 4 or 5. Microsoft can't afford to ignore low-end phone users -- it'd cut off a large chunk of its potential audience if it focused solely on recent or higher-end devices.

We use Win10S as an option for schools or businesses that want the 'low-hassle'/ guaranteed performance version. Next year 10S will be a "mode" of existing versions, not a distinct version. SO ... I think it's totally fine/good that it's not mentioned. — Joe Belfiore (@joebelfiore) March 7, 2018  Windows 10 S was designed to be a competitor for Chrome OS -- a lightweight, more secure and more powerful operating system. However, implementation left something to be desired. In order to take full advantage of Windows 10 S, users were required to obtain a copy Windows 10 Pro. It's more than many users wanted or needed.  The official details aren't clear, but according to a leak from early February, S Mode will be available for all versions of Windows 10 except Core+ and Workstation. The cost of upgrading from S mode to full access would depend on the version of Windows you're running; it would be free for some, while others would have to pay a $49 fee.  It's not clear when this will take place, or when we'll see more details from Microsoft on Windows 10 S. Belfiore says in his tweet that this will happen "next year," so we may have to wait awhile before it actually comes to fruition.

Besides providing a more natural flow to your conversation, it also spares you from using a smart speaker's wake word unless it's actually necessary. Many AI helpers can skip wake words when they want an immediate follow-up ("would you like me to send the message?") but this would keep the conversation humming until you're truly done.  The initial plan is to spread this technology to Microsoft's other chatbots, such as Zo in the US and Rinna in Japan. It's pretty clear that this could be useful for Cortana and just about any other conversational AI, though.

The tech titans keep getting more titanic.  Alphabet, the parent company of search-engine giant Google, became the second publicly traded U.S. company ever to reach a market value of $800 billion Monday, joining iPhone maker Apple. Alphabet’s Class A shares rose 1.8% to $1,164.00.  Meantime, Microsoft was on track Monday to become the third public U.S. company ever to close with a market value of $700 billion, joining Apple and Alphabet. Shares rose as much as 1.4% to $91.23 and were recently up 1.2%. On Jan. 16, Microsoft briefly touched $700 billion before falling back below that level.  Alphabet has already added about $74 billion in market capitalization this year as of midday Monday, while Microsoft is up about $43 billion, a combined total of $117 billion in added market value for the two tech giants since the start of 2018.  Apple crossed the $700 billion threshold in February 2015 and passed $800 billion and $900 billion last year. It hit that last milestone shortly after Alphabet hit $700 billion.  Monday’s fresh highs are the latest major markers hit by U.S. internet giants in the past year. Investors have flocked to the largest technology firms for their ability to grow revenue despite mixed economic data. Some analysts have said they expect recent gains and lofty valuations in the S&P 500 information technology sector—which is up 42% in the past year—have left the grouping vulnerable to a pullback, but technology stocks have still been among the best performers at the start of 2018.  On Jan. 8, e-commerce firm Amazon.com crossed $600 billion for the first time.  Microsoft’s recent rise has come as the software giant continues to prioritize cloud computing. Microsoft’s next earnings report is expected at the end of the month.  Alphabet has surged over the past year as advertisers spend more and more money on its platforms. Google and Facebook controlled nearly two-thirds of total digital ad spending last year, according to eMarketer, and Alphabet has taken another leg higher in the first days of 2018 as Facebook shares have stumbled on speculation that the retooling of its platform will hurt its advertising revenue.  Although some analysts have said they expect investors to begin to move money out of the tech sector, few think technology stocks are anywhere close to the froth from the dot-com bubble. Microsoft’s recent climb to $600 billion, a mark it also hit in the late 1990s before falling, took much longer than its first ascent.  It’s anyone’s guess what the next technology market-cap milestone will be. Some had speculated that Apple could climb to $1 trillion, but the iPhone maker has fallen back around$900 billion instead amid doubts about the success of its latest products.

BRUSSELS—European lawmakers and companies worry that a lawsuit the U.S. government has brought to the Supreme Court could clash with European Union law, trapping tech companies between complying with U.S. data requests and strict EU data-privacy rules.  The case, set to be heard next month, stems from a dispute between the Justice Department and Microsoft Corp. over access to emails stored on a server in Ireland. Industry officials say it highlights the stark differences between the U.S. and Europe over views on online privacy and the extent of government access to users’ data.  The U.S. government in 2013 obtained a search warrant requiring Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft to hand over email information as part of an investigation into a customer who allegedly was using the account to conduct criminal drug activity.  Microsoft complied with part of the order but rebuffed the request to turn over the email messages, which were stored abroad, arguing that U.S. search warrants don’t reach data stored outside domestic borders. Microsoft argues that complying with the warrant would have meant the company could have run afoul of EU privacy rules.  At issue in the court case are broader questions about who should govern global internet companies, and how. In particular, cloud computing companies, such as Microsoft or Amazon.com Inc., can move data among different servers around the world.  Microsoft says it stores users’ data in the region where a user resides and customers should be in control of their data.  The U.S. argues that its warrant required Microsoft to hand over the information because it can be accessed in the U.S. with the click of a computer mouse, and lack of access to that data could pose significant barriers to ongoing investigations.  “Hundreds if not thousands of investigations of crimes—ranging from terrorism, to child pornography, to fraud—are being or will be hampered by the government’s inability to obtain electronic evidence,” the Justice Department said in a court brief.  A U.S. government win in the case could hand U.S. companies operating in Europe an expensive dilemma: either comply with U.S. data requests or risk breaching EU data privacy rules. European companies with business operations in the U.S. also fear they could receive similar requests from American authorities sent to their headquarters abroad.  “This untenable position would throw a wrench into the countless routine business arrangements that comprise today’s highly interdependent commercial world,” the largest trade organizations from Germany, Ireland, Poland and France said in a joint filing to the court.  Foreign governments can access evidence in Europe for criminal investigations, but the preferred method under EU law is to go directly through member states, as part of what is known as a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty. That approach will be enshrined in the bloc’s new data protection regulation, to enter into force in May. The new rules threaten fines as high as 4% of a firm’s global revenue for failure to comply.  Washington’s position seems to fly in the face of EU sovereignty, some European officials and legal experts said.  “This can clearly escalate to being a conflict of law and international relations,” said Jan Philipp Albrecht, a Green Party member of the European Parliament and staunch privacy advocate. “The question [is] if the EU can expect that their own laws apply to their own territory and market or is the U.S. trying to put that into question?”  Companies, governments and institutions in Europe and elsewhere have submitted third-party briefs to the court ahead of the hearing, which is set for February 27. A decision is expected by June.  The U.K., one of the U.S.’s closest law-enforcement allies in Europe, has thrown its weight behind Washington’s arguments in the case. Britain, which is preparing to exit the EU, is also currently negotiating a bilateral treaty with the U.S. over access for law-enforcement purposes to electronic communications held on servers in each other’s jurisdictions.  The case is reminding some Europeans of leaks by one-time National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden disclosing that U.S. tech companies cooperated with the NSA, allowing authorities to access information through a so-called backdoor. Those revelations sowed deep mistrust in Europe of U.S. intelligence practices, straining trans-Atlantic ties and hindering cooperation between Washington and Brussels in other areas.  U.S. tech companies also came under scrutiny from the broader public following the revelations. That is one reason Microsoft is fighting so hard: to maintain its reputation. Microsoft says it has only provided data to the U.S. government under valid legal orders.  “Pre-Snowden, this would have been done quietly, there would have been an accommodation” between Microsoft and the government, said James A. Lewis, a senior vice president at the Center for Strategic & International Studies, a Washington-based think tank. “Everyone would have gone away happy.”  Now, “they need to show the world, their global customer base, that they’re not just going to roll over every time the U.S. government asks them for something,” he said.

WASHINGTON—A $1.3 trillion spending deal that President Donald Trump signed Friday includes a measure that gives U.S. investigators access to data stored on overseas cloud servers, resolving a long-running legal battle between law enforcement and big tech companies.  But the measure drew widespread criticism from privacy and human-rights activists, who suggested U.S. tech companies—under pressure in Washington—had retreated on the issue. They also suggested the bill could leave data stored in the U.S. vulnerable to demands by authoritarian foreign governments.  The measure, known as the Cloud Act, would create a legal framework for resolving the frequent conflicts that have sprung up recently over the issue.  It would amend U.S. law to make clear that law-enforcement warrants can apply to data that U.S.-based tech companies store anywhere in the world. But the act also would give companies a right to challenge warrants in court based on privacy laws in the specific country where the data are stored.  It also would allow for bilateral agreements between the U.S. and other countries over how to deal with disputes in the future, including other countries’ requests for data in the U.S.  The issue has come up more frequently in recent years, as big U.S. tech companies have stored more data overseas. One problem fueling the conflicts is that the 1986 federal law in question, the Stored Communications Act, is ill-suited to current cross-border data-storage practices.  In one case pending before the Supreme Court, a federal appeals court sided with Microsoft Corp. in holding that warrants for customer data can’t be enforced on U.S. providers if the data are stored overseas.  The Justice Department and state attorneys general say the lower-court ruling has hindered investigations into an array of crimes, from narcotics trafficking to arson to child pornography. Electronic evidence is now critical to virtually every criminal investigation, they say.  But Microsoft, Alphabet Inc.’s Google unit and other technology companies have argued the Justice Department’s position would leave them caught in the middle between U.S. law-enforcement demands and their obligation to abide by privacy laws in foreign jurisdictions.  The Justice Department applied for a warrant requiring Microsoft to turn over email information from an account allegedly tied to illegal drug activity in the U.S. Microsoft handed over some account data that were stored in the U.S. but said it shouldn’t have to hand over the emails, which were stored on a server in Ireland.  The companies say the case ultimately could threaten American dominance in the $250 billion cloud-computing industry, because foreign clients won’t use U.S. firms if their data aren’t protected.  The enactment of the Cloud legislation might leave little for the Supreme Court to decide in the Microsoft case. When the court heard oral arguments in February, multiple justices said congressional intervention would be welcome.  "It would be good if Congress enacted legislation that modernized this,” Justice Samuel Alito said.  Tech groups criticized the new measure’s implications for privacy in several respects, casting it as a surrender of sorts in the wake of the Microsoft case.  "The Cloud Act is a disappointing outcome after so many human-rights groups weighed in on the Microsoft case at the U.S. Supreme Court,” said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center.  EPIC and other groups had pushed for many updates to the 1980s-era privacy law, he said, “but they were ignored.” Greg Nojeim of the Center for Democracy and Technology said the deal gives the Justice Department too much leeway to open up U.S. data to authoritarian foreign governments.  “DOJ could use this legislation to diminish privacy rights world-wide, or to persuade other governments to raise their surveillance standards in order to qualify for an agreement,“ he said. ”We fear the U.S. Congress hasn’t done enough to require DOJ to make the right decisions.”  “The internet industry applauds Congress for including the Cloud Act in the omnibus spending bill,” said Melika Carroll, a senior vice president for the Internet Association, a trade group representing big tech companies. “It’s critical that we modernize U.S. privacy laws to reflect current realities of how data is stored around the world. Passing the Cloud Act will enable law enforcement to gather data stored abroad for the purposes of investigating serious crimes, while still protecting individual privacy rights.”  —Brent Kendall contributed to this article.

Qualcomm  $4.7  $4.0  But there is a catch: All companies will be forced to pay a one-time tax on the overseas profits they have accumulated so far, at 15.5% on cash and liquid assets and 8% on other assets, including factories and equipment. The tax is due regardless of whether they bring it home or not, though companies may choose to pay it over eight years. Businesses must generally book this tax as a one-time charge in the final quarter of 2017. Apple said this month it would pay $38 billion in taxes and return the majority of its overseas cash to the U.S.  The taxes companies pay on these profits will vary somewhat, depending on both the size of the profits and how they have been invested. Companies must pay 15.5% on liquid assets, such as cash and a variety of marketable securities, and 8% on other assets. Technology companies tend to have a larger amount of liquid assets as a share of their overseas stockpile than other industries: For instance, 95% of networking giant Cisco Systems Inc.’s accumulated foreign profit last year was in cash and cash equivalents, versus 22% for retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc.  The Wall Street Journal estimated that 311 large publicly traded companies could generate nearly $250 billion in these taxes, of which 38% could be paid by tech companies.  Tax rates  Tech giants generally enjoy low effective tax rates because a portion of their profits accumulate in low-tax foreign jurisdictions. Tech firms paid an average tax rate of 24% over the 10-year period through 2016, below the 29% average tax rate for all companies in the S&P 500 for that period and lower than any other industry, according to an analysis of corporate filings by Zion Research Group.  Low Rates Tech companies in S&P 500 with the lowest average tax rates over 10 years. Average tax rates For 2007-2016 Alphabet 19.7% Cisco 18.5% Qualcomm  17.1%  Ebay  13.1%  Hewlett-Packard Ent.  12.6%  21%  Federal statutory tax rate  Companies that pay the lowest effective rates may be punished by the new rules, which set a minimum 10.5% tax on wide swaths of future offshore profits. That means firms like Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Cisco Systems, which over the past decade have paid lower tax rates on average than the new statutory rate of 21%, may soon see their rates go up. International Business Machines Inc., which paid a tax rate of 12% last year excluding one-time benefits, said this month its rate will rise to as much as 18% in 2018.  The five biggest tech companies— Apple Inc., Alphabet, Microsoft Corp. , Amazon.com Inc. and Facebook Inc. —all report earnings this week and investors will be looking for guidance on tax rates.  Use of capital  Now that companies are free to bring foreign cash to the U.S. at no added cost, they will be dogged with the question of how they plan to spend it. Tech firms are already among the biggest spenders on research and development and on acquisitions. Adding to these budgets may not be the answer.

The Republicans sold the tax overhaul on the promise that it would return investment to the U.S., not to enrich shareholders.  “It will be interesting to see what companies ultimately do with more unfettered access to their global cash,” said Kirsten Malm, a partner at law firm Baker McKenzie who advises tech firms on taxes. “Is this going to set off a new wave of M&A? Will we see share buybacks? Maybe not, because share prices are so high at the moment.”  Borrowing  With most of their cash sitting offshore, tech giants have increasingly issued debt to finance their growth and return money to shareholders. Tech firms in the S&P 500 collectively held nearly $566 billion in long-term debt in the most recent quarter, more than three times the amount they held just five years ago. That is a faster pace of growth than any other sector.  Racking Up Debt Tech companies acquired debt at a faster pace than any other sector in the S&P 500 over the last five years.

That includes Apple, with long-term debt of $97 billion; Microsoft, with $76 billion; and Oracle Corp. , with $58 billion.
