Photo  The best known, though, is Dinara Kasko, a Ukrainian architect-turned-pastry chef who became an internet sensation last year for her sculptural, highly geometric desserts: a cherry cake made to look like shiny red bubbles encased in a cube, and a berry-almond tart with a mazelike surface, constructed with a mold made by a 3D printer.  The link between architecture and pastry dates back at least to 1815, when the renowned French chef Marie-Antoine Car\u00eame wrote \u201cLe Patissier Royal,\u201d a treatise that codified how architectural principles like drawing and planning could be applied in pastry. Chefs have long played with the structural possibilities of sugar, egg whites, flour and other ingredients.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  But today, architectural values and technology are shaping the new norms for dessert. And while the results are carefully plotted and constructed, they are not always towering or eye-popping. In fact, this new school of pastry chefs is trying to rescue the dessert course from the outlandish unicorn cakes and mile-high ice cream sundaes that saturate Instagram.  Photo  \u201cYou have all these photos of desserts covered in rainbows and sparkles, and they might taste like sawdust, but no one knows, because it looks great on social media,\u201d lamented Jansen Chan, a former architect who is now the director of pastry at the International Culinary Center in New York and the Bay Area. \u201cInstagram is a great way for pastry chefs to communicate, but there\u2019s also the danger of people walking away from great pastry just because it\u2019s not totally visually driven.\u201d  Why have he and other chefs made such a radical career shift? In interviews, several said they realized while working in architecture that pastry required a similar skill set, and they found baking a cake a lot more interesting \u2014 and immediately gratifying \u2014 than designing a building.  Ms. Yee, 39, always wanted to be a pastry chef, but went to architecture school to placate her parents, who wanted her to have what she calls \u201ca real job.\u201d She landed a position at the San Francisco design firm Georgina Rice & Co., where she assisted in designing interiors, mostly for high-end apartments.  Photo  Tired of having to abide by mundane building codes and regulations, and wanting something more creative, she began studying pastry in 2002 at Le Cordon Bleu in London, while working as a pastry assistant at the Connaught hotel for the chefs Gordon Ramsay and Angela Hartnett.  She found that her architectural training applied in the pastry kitchen as well. \u201cBeing an architect is not all about the structure,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the intent. How will this improve someone\u2019s life?\u201d  \u201cDesserts are also about thoughtfulness,\u201d she added. \u201cWhat are the ways I can manipulate this apple? What will highlight what\u2019s grown here? It\u2019s about looking at your environment and seeing what will be functional and beautiful in that space.\u201d  Photo  Consider the \u00e9clair, Ms. Yee\u2019s signature dessert when she was the pastry chef at the French restaurant Lafayette in New York from 2013 to 2016.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  \u00c9clairs are highly technical, she said, vulnerable to everything from the level of protein in the flour to the type of oven you are using. The pastry can easily come out overly dry, or completely lose its oblong shape when baked.  But precision, for her, is only one priority. \u201cI wanted some element of spontaneity and approachability,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I garnished them, I would make the glaze a little wonky on the side, or cut the fruit on top in a random way.\u201d  Photo  That attentiveness runs through the sweet creations of Lisa Lu, 49, who oversaw the pastry department at the landmark San Francisco restaurant Boulevard from 2012 to 2017, and is now a production manager at the chocolate company Recchiuti Confections. Two decades ago, as an interior architect, she worked on creative projects like the American Licorice Company corporate headquarters in Bend, Ore., and a mock-up for a shop for the sports apparel brand UltraNectar, in the Bay Area.  \u201cHaving studied architecture,\u201d she said, \u201cI can put together a plated dessert because I understand composition \u2014 the need for balance and a focal point.\u201d  The lime tart she used to serve at Boulevard, like Ms. Yee\u2019s apple strudel, looks nothing like what a diner might expect. Ms. Lu balances a marrow-bone-shaped pastry shell filled with a tangy lime curd and pomegranate seeds on a plate, piping toasted meringue all around the tart, \u201cso that if a server wasn\u2019t careful when transporting the dessert, it would still be intact by the time it got to the table.\u201d The meringue acts like mortar, sealing the tart into place and giving the dessert stability.  Photo  \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect example of balance,\u201d Ms. Lu said. \u201cThe shell, which is designed to be open enough to be able to pipe in a curd, is the focal point. The meringue is piped in a few key areas, and then the scattered pomegranate seeds draw your eye around the plate and connect the whole dessert together.\u201d  To pastry chefs who learned the craft the old-fashioned way and don\u2019t work in the world of high-end restaurants, that kind of talk can sound like an overly cerebral or pretentious way to describe something simple: the joy of creating something sweet.  Stella Parks, a senior editor at Serious Eats and the author of the classic American dessert cookbook \u201cBraveTart,\u201d sees some good in the architectural influence on pastry, noting that it has brought more rigor into the practice.  Photo  \u201cMy worry,\u201d she added, \u201cis always that the culinary element is being forgotten. I have had so many meals at high-end restaurants that were extremely memorable, but more like a trip to a modern art museum, where you would never want those kinds of things in your own home.\u201d  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Agatha Kulaga, a self-taught baker and a founder of the New York City bakery Ovenly, agreed; architectural ideals, she said, often leave out a vital element: nostalgia.  \u201cThe usefulness of an architecture background really depends on the end goal,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can have a dessert made by a pastry chef that feels like looking at a work of art \u2014 or you can have a dessert like a cookie or a slice of cake that doesn\u2019t necessarily feel like art, but creates an experience of joy.\u201d  Photo  But Baruch Ellsworth, the pastry chef at Canlis, in Seattle, who studied architecture at a California community college, said elements like taste and emotion are essential components of the architectural pastry practice. The difference is that they are incorporated more methodically.  Both pastry and architecture, he said, are an equation: \u201cA and B always have to equal C. You can tweak A and B lots of times, but it has to add up. You can\u2019t wing it.\u201d In other words, you can be as creative as you want in your choice of flavors of ingredients, but in the end, the dessert has to be something that people will want to eat, \u201cjust like when you make a building: you can do anything as long as it won\u2019t fall down.\u201d  One of his most popular desserts explores the kaleidoscopic, shape-shifting nature of chocolate. On a single plate, there\u2019s a tobacco-infused chocolate mousse, a Madagascar chocolate brownie, a milk chocolate crisp, a cocoa nib brittle, a caramel cream with caramelized white chocolate, and white chocolate streusel \u2014 all covered in a dehydrated layer of chocolate that elegantly drapes over each component like a silk sheet.  Photo  Mr. Ellsworth compared desserts like that to the Guggenheim Museum in New York. \u201cAt first, you\u2019re like, \u2018I can\u2019t believe this is a building,\u2019 because the outside looks like a tornado,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when you go inside, you realize it is quite functional.\u201d  At the International Culinary Center in California and New York, known for turning out acclaimed pastry chefs like Christina Tosi, of Milk Bar, and Melissa Weller, the founder of Sadelle\u2019s bakery in SoHo, architecture plays a significant role in the curriculum, thanks to Mr. Chan, 42, and his architectural background.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Since 2015, the second half of the school\u2019s six-month pastry program has incorporated lessons on sketching, making timelines and project planning. Mr. Chan added a chapter called \u201cElements of Design\u201d to the school\u2019s textbook; it teaches students about architectural principles like dynamism and scale in relation to dessert.  Photo  Mr. Chan said a number of students have recently come to the school from the architecture world. \u201cThey have a much easier time at adapting because they are used to being asked questions. They are better able to express their creative ideas,\u201d he said. \u201cPastry students with no design backgrounds will be the ones to draw a tall chocolate structure with nothing holding it up.\u201d  Mr. Chan has also introduced technology into pastry education \u2014 tools like lasers, which can be used to bake and pipe batter at the same time, and water-jet cutters, used by architects to slice through sheet metal and by large-scale patisseries and hotels for cutting cakes into precise, programmed shapes in the half the time it would take a person to complete.  Not everyone endorses this approach, though. \u201cArchitecture and pastry are both very human schools of thought,\u201d said Ms. Yee, who makes the un-strudel-like strudel. \u201cYou are always thinking about what people will like. This kind of technology, to me, dehumanizes food. You\u2019re taking away the personal aspect of cooking.\u201d  Some blame technology for the glorification of social-media oddities like clear pumpkin pie, or ice cream wrapped in a cloud of cotton candy.  Mr. Chan recalled encountering a red velvet cake at a bakery in Thailand on a recent trip.  \u201cIt resembled a red velvet cake,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it didn\u2019t have any cocoa. Someone had seen it online but didn\u2019t take the time to look up what, actually, is in a red velvet cake. That\u2019s the problem with social media. You lose context.

When news broke Monday that Mr. Giannandrea was unexpectedly stepping down as Google\u2019s A.I. chief, he immediately became perhaps the most eligible tech executive on the market. By Tuesday, it became clear he was never really on the market.  Apple has made other high-profile hires in the field, including the Carnegie Mellon professor Russ Salakhutdinov. Mr. Salakhutdinov studied at the University of Toronto under Geoffrey Hinton, who helps oversee the Google Brain lab.  Apple has taken a strong stance on protecting the privacy of people who use its devices and online services, which could put it at a disadvantage when building services using neural networks.  Researchers train these systems by pooling enormous amounts of digital data, sometimes from customer services. Apple, however, has said it is developing methods that would allow it to train these algorithms without compromising privacy.  On the debate over whether humanity should be worried about the rapidly accelerating improvements in A.I., Mr. Giannandrea told MIT Technology Review in an interview last year that the concerns were overblown.  \u201cWhat I object to is this assumption that we will leap to some kind of superintelligent system that will then make humans obsolete,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand why people are concerned about it but I think it\u2019s gotten way too much airtime.

Baird & Company, wrote in a research report.  While Amazon\u2019s online store sales grew 20 percent from a year earlier, the company\u2019s total retail growth benefited from its acquisition of Whole Foods Markets. That deal, announced in June, added much of the $4.52 billion in physical store revenue for the quarter.  Yet the biggest revenue growth came from a category generically named \u201cother,\u201d which includes advertising services and rose 62 percent to $1.74 billion from a year earlier.  By far the most profitable big business for the company was Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing unit. Its revenue rose 45 percent to $5.11 billion, and its operating income increased 46 percent to $1.35 billion.  Amazon kept with its tradition of secrecy by refusing to reveal exactly how many of its Echo family of devices it sold, saying only that it sold \u201ctens of millions\u201d of them last year. The company priced the devices aggressively over the holidays \u2014 its cheapest was only $29. The devices probably did not yield much profit, though they are an important part of Amazon\u2019s effort to establish a technology ecosystem that could result in other benefits, such as enabling customers to make impulse purchases with their voices.  Photo  Apple, in contrast, is without equal in making profits from tech hardware.  For the company\u2019s fiscal first quarter, it reported a record for quarterly net income \u2014 $20.07 billion, up 12 percent from a year earlier. Revenue rose 13 percent to $88.3 billion. The gains were notable considering that Apple\u2019s fiscal first quarter was a week shorter than the previous year\u2019s 14-week fiscal first quarter.  While Amazon is content to price its devices near its costs for making them, Apple is known for charging a premium for its smartphones, tablets and computers. The iPhone X, which uses facial recognition to unlock the device, is the most expensive in its history, starting at almost $1,000.

Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said on the company\u2019s earnings call.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Mr. Cook noted that the iPhone X was the company\u2019s top-selling phone in the quarter despite its November release, roughly a month and a half after Apple\u2019s other new iPhones.  The company sold 77.3 million iPhones over the quarter, which was down 1 percent from the longer quarter a year earlier. Yet revenue was higher largely because of the pricing of the new iPhones: In addition to introducing the iPhone X, Apple raised the price of the base model of its iPhone to $699, up from the $649 starting price for past iPhones.  Sales in its \u201cother products\u201d category, which includes the Apple Watch, grew 36 percent to $5.5 billion. Apple declined to disclose sales of the Apple Watch for competitive reasons, but Mr. Cook noted on the earnings call that revenue for the Apple Watch had grown 50 percent.  Apple also highlighted money generated from services, which include the App Store and Apple Music, with revenue rising 18 percent to $8.5 billion. Apple said the App Store continued to be the top destination for smartphone customers to buy apps.  Apple sold 13.2 million iPads, up 1 percent \u2014 notable because iPad sales declined for many consecutive quarters over the last few years. But Mac sales shrank about 5 percent to 5.1 million units.  Despite strong sales of the pricey iPhone X, some analysts remained concerned that its sales were slowing. Ahead of the earnings call, some news reports said Apple was slashing production of the iPhone X for the quarter that ends in March. The reports cited supply chain partners that said Apple had cut orders for parts.  But in years past, Apple has warned investors that activities of its complex supply chain were an unreliable metric for overall sales. The company also typically slows down iPhone production after the holiday quarter, which is the peak shopping season.  Last month, Apple also unveiled plans to bring the vast majority of its $252 billion in cash held abroad back to the United States, paying a one-time repatriation tax of $38 billion. Because the company had already earmarked $36.4 billion in anticipation that it would eventually have to pay taxes on its foreign earnings, Apple did not see much impact from the recent tax code changes.  Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, said that in light of the new tax code, the company would announce plans for its repatriated cash, including dividends and buybacks, in April."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/06/technology/personaltech/frozen-apple-tv-app.html", "date": "2018-02-06T18:46:28Z", "host": "the-new-york-times", "article": "Q.

The activist hedge fund Jana Partners and the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System want Apple to give parents better controls over their children\u2019s iPhones. It\u2019s an unusual issue for an activist, and apps from Facebook and Snap would make better targets.  Together, the hedge fund and teachers\u2019 pension giant want Apple to take responsibility for how its products are affecting children. In a letter to the board on Saturday, the activists \u2014 which include the pop star Sting and his wife, Trudie Styler, as advisers \u2014 cited research that suggests heavy smartphone use is linked to a rise of depression and suicide among teenagers and young adults.  The popularity of the iPhone, which was introduced more than a decade ago, has spread to an ever-younger demographic, leaving educators and researchers scrambling to understand how it may be affecting children\u2019s development. Yet other technology outfits are culprits, too, and provide rich targets. More people have smartphones that run on Google\u2019s Android system, rather than on Apple\u2019s operating system. Facebook\u2019s and Snapchat\u2019s business models depend on increasing the time spent on mobile phones and target children under the age of 13 with specialized apps.  It\u2019s a worthy theme to explore but a departure for Jana. The hedge fund, led by Barry Rosenstein, is best known for getting tangible results measured in dollars by agitating for things like a sale of Whole Foods or a shake-up of the board of Tiffany. In this case, it\u2019s smartly teaming up with Calstrs, the largest public-sector teachers\u2019 pension fund in the United States and one that\u2019s increasingly emphasizing social responsibility with its investments. Together, the two hold roughly $2 billion worth of Apple stock.  The fact that Jana is starting a campaign in the more squishy territory of sustainability and ethics could signal a broader shift in the winds. Investors are increasingly pushing companies to address a wider range of issues and risks. Exxon Mobil and climate change are one example. Gender equality and the ability to attract more diverse talent are also issues that are rising to the level of proxies.  Silicon Valley used to enjoy an exalted status, but questions about the role of social media in the 2016 presidential election and the way digital technologies may threaten jobs and promote monopolies are breeding skepticism.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Perhaps eager to stop the rout, the White House on Monday had a less confrontational message: Mr. Trump is applying one of his negotiating tactics. According to this view, the tariff proposal was a jarring move partly aimed at getting China to see that the U.S. was serious about wanting to make trade with China fairer.  From a CNBC interview with Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers:  \u201cFrom the beginning, all the way back to last summer when I arrived at the White House, the president has been clear that he wants to set a marker down with some big asks at the beginning, he doesn\u2019t want to dribble them out, and then he wants his negotiators to try to fix the trade problems. ...Hopefully, it all works out with negotiation.\u201d  Mr. Hassett\u2019s comments were in response to a WSJ article reporting that China and the U.S. were quietly engaged in trade negotiations.  Investors seemed somewhat relieved: The stock market was up 1.5 percent on Monday. Of course, if the stakes are small enough, a deal may get done in the coming months that allows both sides to claim victory. But it seems unlikely that China would quickly agree to a far-reaching overhaul of the rules that govern foreign investment in the country, a major area of dispute. Our colleagues Raymond Zhong and Paul Mozur showed the depth of the divide there.  Mr. Trump could up the ante if China shows no real signs that it will open up considerably. That could roil the markets again. The White House may want to signal that it can take market turmoil in stride. Mr. Hassett on Monday seemed to say that the White House expects market sell-offs as it pursues its trade agenda.  \u201cIf you start from a world where a bunch your intellectual technology is being stolen, then of course it\u2019s going to increase risk premiums in the short run when you try to do something about it, but in the end it should be a positive for us if we can get them to just stop them disregarding the rules of international order.\u201d  (Rising risk premiums means investors require a better return on their stocks and bonds to cover higher risks. This usually involves a decline in price to make their returns look better to prospective buyers.)  Still, the more conciliatory tone from the White House after the sell-off suggests there is not a strong desire for a full-on trade war.  \u2014 Peter Eavis  Shares of Facebook continue to slide.  The stock is down 6.5 percent Monday morning as the Federal Trade Commission confirmed that it has opened an investigation into Facebook\u2019s privacy practice.

Facebook\u2019s shares are down nearly 22 percent since its high in early February and off more than 18 percent since the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke more than a week ago.  To put Facebook\u2019s recent tumble in perspective: The stock is set for its worst monthly performance since August 2012. Over the past 10 days, Facebook has lost $100 billion in market value.  Despite the fall, Wall Street has not soured on Facebook. Forty-four analysts have buy ratings on the stock, compare to just two who have sell ratings, according to Bloomberg.  Photo  Tim Cook thinks regulation of Facebook is inevitable  The Apple C.E.O. said at the China Development Forum in Beijing that the government should tighten privacy regulations, after last week\u2019s revelations about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica:  \u201cI think that this certain situation is so dire and has become so large that probably some well-crafted regulation is necessary. The ability of anyone to know what you\u2019ve been browsing about for years, who your contacts are, who their contacts are, things you like and dislike and every intimate detail of your life \u2014 from my own point of view, it shouldn\u2019t exist.\u201d  Apple often uses privacy as a selling point, but Mr. Cook wasn\u2019t the only critic. Elon Musk deleted SpaceX and Tesla\u2019s Facebook pages, saying that the Tesla one \u201clooks lame anyway.\u201d Sir Martin Sorrell of the ad giant WPP said Facebook needed to \u201cstep up to the mark\u201d and be responsible for content on its platform. And some companies have stopped buying ads on Facebook, highlighting how advertisers want more transparency about performance. (Users also complained that the Android app tracked calls and text messages.)  Meanwhile, Facebook took out full-page ads in several British and American newspapers \u2014 including the NYT \u2014 for an apology signed by Mark Zuckerberg.  Elsewhere in Cambridge Analytica news: A volunteer for the campaign for Britain to leave the E.U. said that a Canadian data company linked to Cambridge Analytica had played a role in the organization\u2019s work. Groups campaigning against Brexit have written to Prime Minister Theresa May demanding an investigation into what members of her cabinet and her staff knew.  Andrew\u2019s take  Mr. Cook\u2019s points on privacy are absolutely right. But he has a tough needle to thread, given that Apple does business in China and acknowledges that it is \u201csubject to each country\u2019s laws\u201d that it does business in. Apple encrypts all user data and says there is no back door \u2014 and I believe that \u2014 most security and political experts have speculated that Beijing might ultimately be able to gain access iCloud data for Chinese customers: It adopted a law requiring all cloud services to be operated by Chinese companies. Apple says that it lobbied against the new law, but ultimately complied.

The activist investor\u2019s fund, Third Point, has built a position in United Technologies, according to an antitrust filing.  He is the second activist investor to reveal a stake in the United Technologies during the past 30 days. On Feb. 28, Bill Ackman told CNBC that his Pershing Square had a position in the defense contractor.  Context  At a conference late last month, Greg Hayes, the chief executive of United Technologies, said the company was thinking of splitting up:  \u201cIs [United Technologies] a more valuable property together or is UTC better off in three separate businesses?

Gebr Knauf disclosed in a filing on Monday that it had offered to buy USG for $42 a share, or about $6 billion. That marked a 25 percent premium to USG closing price on Friday.  In rejecting the offer, USG said the proposal substantially undervalued the building products maker.  Knauf owns 10.5 percent of USG, making Knauf the second-largest shareholder in USG behind Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway with a 31 percent stake.  Berkshire had proposed an option for Knauf to buy Berkshire\u2019s stake in USG, according to the filing. The option would be exercisable only if Knauf bought all of USG\u2019s shares outstanding for at least $42. Berkshire proposed an option purchase price of $2 per share.  From Reuters:  The option provides a sweetener for Buffett to shed a profitable investment that originated in late 2008, at the height of the housing crisis, when Berkshire and Canada\u2019s Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd bought $400 million of USG\u2019s debt. The $2 per share cost of the option would provide Berkshire about $86.8 million upfront, based on its 43.39 million share USG stake. Berkshire would keep that money even if Knauf proved unable to buy USG.  Shares of USG are up 19 percent Monday.

Leading them: Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Liu He, Beijing\u2019s economic czar.  Among Washington\u2019s requests, in a letter to Mr. Liu, were lower Chinese tariffs on American cars and more freedom for Wall Street firms to expand in China.  Mr. Mnuchin told \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that he believed the recent rate increase by the Federal Reserve was to blame for recent market declines, not tariffs. He added, \u201cWe\u2019re not afraid of a trade war, but that\u2019s not our objective.\u201d  News of the talks have lifted markets in Asia and Europe, while S.&P. 500 futures jumped this morning.

The trouble with writing the unvarnished truth in a memoir is that it requires you to be hard not only on others, but also on yourself.  Matt Young\u2019s inventive, unsparing, irreverent and consistently entertaining \u201cEat the Apple\u201d is that, but it is also a useful corrective to the current idealization of the American soldier \u2014 or in this case a Marine. Patriotism and respect for the military is so high in this country that we have lately held a national debate over whether professional athletes should be required to stand for the national anthem. Men and women in uniform are given preference in boarding airplanes, and are so routinely thanked for their service that the expression has become rote. Each new season brings a crop of movies and glossy TV serials dramatizing the heroics of our Special Operations.  Young sees hollowness and potential harm in this.  \u201cEnforcing the idea that every service member is a hero is dangerous,\u201d he writes. \u201cLike creating a generation of veterans who believe everything they did was good.\u201d Young warns of \u201ccreating an army of fanatics.\u201d  Service deserves respect, of course, but it does not in itself guarantee stirring and selfless acts of bravery. Young is his own case in point. He sees his experience \u2014 three tours in Iraq \u2014 as far from heroic. He is at least as disturbed by his duty as he is proud of it. These contradictory feelings are a central theme in his book. Years removed, he both loathes and pines for the man he became in the Marine Corps.

The chip maker only just wiggled out from under a takeover offer from rival Broadcom. What Qualcomm really needs is less a buyer and more a mediator.  There are usually two reasons to take a company private \u2014 the idea that the new owner can run it better, or a belief that the market is valuing it wrongly. Broadcom took the first path, and pointed at Qualcomm\u2019s paltry revenue growth and relatively low operating margins. Mr. Jacobs, whose father co-founded the company, is not the man to tackle those problems \u2014 if he were, he would have done it when he was executive chairman.  Valuation is a more compelling argument. It hinges on Qualcomm\u2019s rift with Apple. The iPhone maker is supposed to pay Qualcomm royalties on every phone sold, but has instructed its suppliers to hold back payment while it haggles with the chip maker on how those should be calculated.  A simple calculation shows how important this is: At $10 per phone on 250 million devices per year, Qualcomm would make $2.5 billion in revenue a year, almost all of which would flow to the bottom line. That\u2019s equivalent to a lump-sum value of perhaps $17 billion, assuming a tax rate of 21 percent and margins of 85 percent. If investors aren\u2019t pricing in any Apple royalty at all right now, that\u2019s enough to justify a price close to the $117 billion Broadcom offered.  Mr. Jacobs, however, is not the right person to mend the rift with Apple. One person who could, in theory, is SoftBank\u2019s Masayoshi Son. The Japanese investor has a longstanding relationship with Apple \u2014 and counts both Apple and Qualcomm as investors in his Vision Fund, which is also one of the financial companies Mr. Jacobs reportedly has been asking to finance a bid. Conceivably, he could help them split the difference.  Would SoftBank\u2019s founder be up for the gig? Qualcomm, as a leader in 5G, is a trophy asset, and having Mr. Jacobs on board might neutralize some of the fear of foreign ownership that destroyed Broadcom\u2019s bid. But Qualcomm is also politically sensitive, a supplier to SoftBank already \u2014 and very big. Even with help, Qualcomm is probably too big a bite for SoftBank to chew. Mr. Jacobs, and Mr. Son for that matter, can use their daring to better effect elsewhere."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/08/technology/apple-tech-children-jana-calstrs.html", "date": "2018-01-09T00:21:42Z", "host": "the-new-york-times", "article": "The backlash against big tech has been growing for months.

Apple also apologized to customers for the slowdowns, offered discounts for its battery-replacement program and said it would introduce software to gain visibility into the health of an iPhone battery.  Yet since then, consumer advocacy groups have filed lawsuits against the company for failing to disclose that the software would throttle old iPhones. The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission have also started an inquiry into the matter, according to a person with knowledge of the situation, who asked not to be named because the details were confidential. Bloomberg earlier reported the inquiry.  Early Wednesday, Apple said in a statement that it had received questions from some government agencies and that it was responding to them; the company did not specify the agencies it had heard from. The Justice Department declined to comment.  As for the wait times that Ms. Schipper and others are experiencing for a battery replacement, a spokeswoman referred to Apple\u2019s support webpage, which states that battery supplies at its stores may be limited.  Let\u2019s not wait around. Here\u2019s a guide to other solutions to keep an iPhone running in the absence of an Apple battery replacement.  Third-Party Repair Shops  Plenty of irate Apple customers are turning to local third-party repair shops to get their iPhone batteries replaced. At Mega Mobile Boston, twice as many customers are coming in for iPhone battery replacements than in years past, said Adam Fullerton, the store\u2019s operations manager.  Third-party repairs are a decent \u2014 but imperfect \u2014 solution. One drawback is that they vary in quality; some repair shops buy lower-quality batteries that don\u2019t last. So to find a good shop, rely on word of mouth and reviews on the web, similar to how you might seek out a good car mechanic.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Another issue is that if you service your phone with a third-party battery and later take your device in to Apple for repair, the company could refuse to service your phone. So if you go the third-party route, chances are you will have to stick with third-party repair shops through the end of your phone\u2019s life.

On Apple\u2019s support webpage, you can look up third-party repair shops that are authorized by Apple as service providers. These are fixers who have been trained by Apple and carry original parts. But the list is short.  If you find a good local fixer, there are plenty of benefits to sticking with one long term. For one, third-party shops tend to have shorter waits. Mr. Fullerton said his shop could typically get an iPhone battery replacement done in about 30 minutes. The process involves opening the device, cleaning away the old waterproofing adhesive, replacing the battery and applying a new waterproofing adhesive.  For another, local repair shops make their prices competitive with the manufacturer\u2019s. In the case of batteries, many shops are discounting their battery replacements to match Apple\u2019s $29 pricing.  \u201cWe\u2019re probably losing money on it with the cost of a half-hour time from a technician,\u201d Mr. Fullerton said. \u201cBut it\u2019s like a loss leader in any other industry. If you\u2019re Best Buy and you get them to buy one item at cost, maybe you can teach them something about your business.\u201d  Finding a good repair shop can feel daunting, but if you ask around, your peers will probably have recommendations. For a sample, here\u2019s a list of highly recommended repair shops in the United States that I compiled from talking to repair experts I trust:  \u25a0 In Chicago: uBreakiFix Chicago  \u25a0 In San Francisco: MacRepair  \u25a0 In New York: Simple Mac  \u25a0 In Boston: Mega Mobile Boston  \u25a0 In Washington: Computer Geeks  \u25a0 In Austin, Tex.: Austin Mac Repair  Fix It Yourself  You can always replace an iPhone battery by yourself. The pros: You can choose the best components for repairs and minimize costs. The cons: Learning repairs can be time consuming, and if you mess up, you have no one to blame but yourself. And again, Apple stores could refuse to service your phone if it sees you have repaired it with third-party parts.  A good place to start for D.I.Y. repairs is iFixit, a company that provides instruction manuals and components for repairing devices. It is offering discounts on battery replacement kits for older iPhones, which cost $17 to $29. Each kit includes a new battery and the tools for disassembling iPhones.  Installing a phone battery can be intimidating. Replacing an iPhone 7 battery, for example, requires eight tools and 28 steps. Kyle Wiens, the chief executive of iFixit, said some customers also opted to buy a battery from iFixit and then take it to a local repair shop for installation.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Carry a Battery Pack  If you don\u2019t feel confident hiring a third-party fixer or installing your own battery, you can always wait for Apple to replace your battery. But since that could take weeks or months, don\u2019t suffer with a sapped phone battery in the meantime.  A better temporary solution is to invest in a battery pack that you can carry around until replacement batteries arrive at an Apple store. Wirecutter, a New York Times company that reviews products, has tested hundreds of battery packs to recommend a few. My favorite is the Anker PowerCore 20100, which can charge a smartphone every day for a week.  Ms. Schipper, the Seattle resident, is considering buying a battery pack. In the meantime, she is constantly plugging her iPhone into a power outlet because her battery lasts only two hours a day.  Yet she has resisted what she thinks Apple wants: for her to buy a new phone.  \u201cI was tempted to just chuck this phone and suck it up and spend $1,000-plus and get the iPhone X,\u201d she said. \u201cI said, \u2018No, darn it, I have a budget I\u2019m saving up.\u2019 I\u2019m not going to let Apple push me around.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/06/us/artificial-intelligence-jobs.html", "date": "2018-03-06T21:13:00Z", "host": "the-new-york-times", "article": "Photo  The vast majority of Americans expect artificial intelligence to lead to job losses in the coming decade, but few see it coming for their own position.

Apple has some catching up to do. Mac laptops and iPads were once the dominant devices in American classrooms, but Google has shot past Apple with inexpensive laptops called Chromebooks. Google has also led the way in software products designed specifically for schools, with an app called Google Classroom that teachers use to take attendance, assign homework and do other tasks, among others.  Of the 12.4 million tablets and laptops shipped to primary and secondary schools in the United States last year, Chromebooks accounted for 58 percent of the market, compared with a negligible share in 2012, according to IDC. In the same period, the share of iPads and Mac laptops fell to 22 percent from about half. And Microsoft Windows devices dropped to 18 percent from about 45 percent, IDC said.  School districts embraced Chromebooks because they were comparatively inexpensive and easy to use. Since the laptops were cloud-based, they could be shared among students who could pick up any device to get access to their documents. And school districts could use a software dashboard to manage thousands of devices at once. Districts that needed to institute online testing began buying Chromebooks in bulk.  Still, Apple generates the most revenue from school hardware sales in the United States, partly because its devices cost more. Of the $5.4 billion spent on school devices last year in the United States, Apple\u2019s iPads and laptops accounted for about $2.1 billion, followed by Chromebooks at $1.95 billion and Microsoft Windows devices at $1.35 billion, according to IDC.  Photo  Apple\u2019s new iPad signals how the company sees an opening at the lower end of the market. Last year, it lowered the price of its entry-level iPad to $329 for consumers and $299 for schools, helping to bolster sales of iPads after years of declines. Some Chromebooks and Windows laptops cost less than $200.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  But as the American market for classroom devices matures and school districts prepare to replace the basic Chromebook laptops they purchased, analysts said Apple was well positioned to take advantage of growing interest among school districts for more sophisticated technologies that encourage student creativity in fields like robotics and computer-assisted design.  \u201cWe\u2019re starting to see an evolution of use cases around coding, STEM, creative arts and design, some of the areas where Apple is focused,\u201d said Ben Davis, a senior analyst in education at Futuresource Consulting, a market research firm that tracks school device shipments. \u201cIn theory, we should start to see a trade-up in computing power in the devices going into schools to support that.\u201d  Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But it opted for the backdrop of a Midwest high school to drive home its education message.

Broadcom typically slashes costs, especially research and development, and the company said it would do exactly that if it acquired Qualcomm. \u201cIn the long run that\u2019s not good for the country or for society,\u201d Mr. Dodson said.  He agreed with the Trump administration\u2019s assessment that, by cutting Qualcomm\u2019s research costs, Broadcom would be assisting Chinese rivals in the global race for dominance in 5G communications technology.  But as an investor, his reasoning can pretty much be reduced to one word: Apple.  Apple has traditionally been one of Qualcomm\u2019s biggest customers, along with Samsung and every other major handset company. But the two technology giants are also embroiled in an epic battle over licensing fees for Qualcomm\u2019s patented technology, with profound implications not only for Qualcomm\u2019s business model and Apple\u2019s profit margins, but for the future of wireless communication.  Photo  If Qualcomm and Apple can just bury the hatchet, Mr. Dodson reasons, Qualcomm\u2019s revenues would soar, and its stock price would climb well past Broadcom\u2019s offering price of $79 a share. By Mr. Dodson\u2019s reckoning, once Apple resumes paying Qualcomm, the chip maker will be worth at least $84 a share, \u201cwhich is why Broadcom\u2019s offer didn\u2019t really engage my attention,\u201d he said.  That, however, is a big \u201cif,\u201d given the intractable positions both sides have staked out.  At the heart of the dispute is the way Qualcomm calculates the licensing fee it charges customers, which is a percentage of the cost of the net selling price of the entire handset \u2014 and not the price of the chip. That means that Apple, a high-cost producer whose iPhone X sells for as much as $1,000, has paid much higher licensing fees than low-cost competitors using exactly the same chip set.  Apple has called the arrangement an \u201cextortion scheme.\u201d It infuriates Apple that Qualcomm has, in effect, been subsidizing its low-cost competitors, including the very Chinese companies that Mr. Trump says he is so concerned about.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Qualcomm has countered that its intellectual property makes many of the iPhones\u2019 distinctive features possible, features that low-cost competitors haven\u2019t replicated, and therefore Qualcomm deserves a percentage of the cost of the entire device.  Mr. Dodson made little immediate headway when he met with a delegation of top Qualcomm officials late last month and pressed his case for a settlement with Apple. The officials, including the chief executive, Steve Mollenkopf, and Paul Jacobs, a Qualcomm founder and, until recently, executive chairman, visited Mr. Dodson in San Francisco to make their case against the Broadcom bid.  In Mr. Dodson\u2019s account of the meeting, he urged the Qualcomm executives to settle with Apple rather than risk alienating it as a customer over the long term. But Qualcomm officials said that Apple was demanding more than they were prepared to give and that, on an engineering level, relations with Apple remained good. They assured him that eventually they would reach a settlement, revenues would normalize and Qualcomm stock would respond.

Still, \u201cI\u2019d like to see them budge\u201d on the licensing issue, Mr. Dodson said. \u201cI can see Apple\u2019s point.\u201d  But if Qualcomm stopped charging Apple a percentage of the device\u2019s cost, it would probably have to extend similar terms to all its major customers. It recently amended its agreement with Samsung without abandoning its approach to license fees. At the meeting, Qualcomm officials told Mr. Dodson they offered Apple similar terms, but Apple rejected them.  A Qualcomm spokeswoman declined to comment, as did an Apple spokeswoman.  Long-simmering tensions between Qualcomm and Apple reached a boiling point in 2016, when Qualcomm halted rebates it was giving Apple. Qualcomm claimed Apple had violated the terms of the rebate agreement by cooperating with South Korea\u2019s investigation into what Samsung and others said was exclusionary conduct by Qualcomm. Apple responded by withholding the license fees it paid manufacturers of iPhones, who in turn stopped passing on the payments to Qualcomm.  Photo  Lawsuits and counterclaims erupted, and Qualcomm reduced its revenue estimates by $500 million a year.  While Apple has continued to buy and deploy the latest Qualcomm chips, it also reached out to a rival chip maker, Intel, which began supplying an alternative to Qualcomm\u2019s chip for the iPhone 7. (That phone, the iPhone 8 and the X may contain either a Qualcomm or an Intel chip.)  Qualcomm claims that Apple has compromised the performance of Qualcomm-equipped handsets in order to mask their superiority over the Intel-equipped phones. (Both Intel and Apple have vehemently denied the claims.)  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Numerous lawsuits are now well underway in the United States, with some expected to go to trial later this year. Regulators in the European Union, Taiwan, South Korea and China have ruled that Qualcomm\u2019s licensing practices are unlawful and have levied fines, decisions that Qualcomm is appealing. In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission is conducting its own investigation.  While armies of patent lawyers fight over the rival claims, investors have already rendered a verdict. Qualcomm shares, after peaking at more than $80 in 2014, dropped by nearly 50 percent, hitting a low of $44 in 2016.  Qualcomm\u2019s precipitous decline is what attracted Mr. Dodson\u2019s attention along with other so-called value investors, who look for stocks trading below their intrinsic value. He said his fund\u2019s average cost per share for its Qualcomm position was about $56, so the fund was still ahead even after the deal collapsed this week. On Thursday, Qualcomm was trading at around $60.  Still, Qualcomm\u2019s performance has knocked the Endeavor fund from its perch at the top of the Morningstar rankings. So far this year, it\u2019s 61st.  Now that Mr. Trump has rescued Qualcomm from the imminent threat of a Broadcom takeover, its financial prospects \u2014 and share price \u2014 will largely follow the twists and turns in the Apple standoff. While Mr. Dodson remains optimistic about the outcome, that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s against all potential takeovers of Qualcomm.  Last week, there were rumors that Intel might launch a bid for Broadcom, which made Mr. Dodson wonder: \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t it bid for Qualcomm? If Intel bought it, Qualcomm would be in good hands.\u201d  \u201cAs a citizen, I\u2019d be very comfortable with that,\u201d he said."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/01/business/boycott-facebook-apple-google-failed.html", "date": "2018-04-01T22:44:00Z", "host": "the-new-york-times", "article": "Ms. Cunningham, who has freelanced for The New York Times, added that she had immediately begun missing Facebook as a research tool for her documentaries. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can get out of the ecosystem,\u201d she said.

Google will consolidate all its existing payment offerings into a new service called Google Pay, which will encompass in-store payments (Android Pay), peer-to-peer (P2P) offerings (Google Wallet), in-app and in-browser payments made through stored credentials in Chrome, and more, according to a company blog post.  Google Pay, which is live in the US, counts several merchant partners, including Airbnb, Fandango, and Instacart, and is likely to see more soon thanks to a wide swath of processor partnerships \u2014 it's already compatible with Adyen, Braintree, Stripe, Vantiv, Worldpay, and others \u2014 that will make merchant integration quick and simple.  Google is working to build a payments ecosystem of its own, which could catalyze usage of its payments offerings, specifically in-store payment products; Android Pay, Google's in-store and in-app offering, falls below average on both the adoption and engagement fronts, counting just 10% adoption among eligible users and the smallest share of repeat users among its peers. And lack of awareness might be hurting its other offerings, like Google Wallet. Google Pay could help grow these metrics in three ways:  Reducing fragmentation through convenience: Customers are paying on their phones, they just aren't doing so in-store; BI Intelligence expects US mobile P2P volume to hit $97 billion this year, and US m-commerce retail sales to hit $150 billion, compared with just $56 billion in-store. By tying more popular offerings to in-store payments, Google is creating a cohesive and convenient brand-wide payment ecosystem, which could draw users to engage more frequently with all these products, increasing volume over time.

Incentivizing users to test the product: Google is working with merchants to give customers a reason to choose Google Pay in-app or in-browser over other providers, like Visa Checkout or PayPal One Touch, through discounts and incentives. These deals might push users to test Google Pay in a friction-filled environment, find it convenient, and continue to return to the service across its use cases, since credentials are already stored.

Drawing customers away from competition:Firms across the payments space are working to build out wide ecosystems: Apple just moved into P2P through the launch of Apple Pay Cash, and P2P-focused services like Venmo are drifting toward commerce, adding in-store and online payment options. To stay afloat as volume expands over the next few years, ecosystems like Google Pay are going to become necessary to keep customers loyal.  But the firm needs to work to take advantage of the synergies for a true success. In its blog post, Google noted that the launch of the Google Pay brand is just a \"first step\" for the product.  And though the firm has some strong justifications for building the ecosystem, that alone isn't going to be enough to see adoption balloon overnight. For the brand to succeed, Google is going to have to take some concrete steps to ensure the service remains the best payment choice for its customers, keeping it top-of-wallet across channels for all consumers. If it doesn't, Google will risk losing out to existing methods or competitors.

To be the first to know, please click here.  Google this week acquired Tenor, a platform for Android, iOS, and desktop, that offers a massive searchable database of GIFs, called \"GIF Keyboard,\" according to a post on Google's blog. Deal terms weren't disclosed, but Tenor will continue to operate independently.  The 4-year-old startup has 50 employees based in San Francisco, New York, and Los Angeles. With roughly 300 million monthly active users (MAU) driving more than 12 billion searches per month, Tenor competes with similar GIF search engines including GIPHY \u2014 the first and largest GIF search engine, with 300 million daily active users (DAU) \u2014 and Gfycat, with roughly 130 million MAU.  It's likely that Tenor's GIF library will be integrated into Google services, in particular search-related services like Google Images. The acquisition could also help Google tap into messaging platforms and apps, as GIF search engines are often built into various mobile messaging platforms for easy accessibility. Social networks have also incorporated GIF search options into their platforms, allowing users to easily find and share the GIF that best expresses a mood or reaction. Tenor's GIF bot is the most-used chatbot on Facebook Messenger, per Forbes.  Tenor could help Google drive digital advertising through emotion-based search. Tenor has been ramping up its advertising business since late 2017. Over the next 90 days, Tenor plans to roll out its first paid advertising product, which will aim to help advertisers target people with branded GIFs, according to Tenor's newly hired Chief Business Officer Jason Krebs per The Wall Street Journal. Ninety percent of Tenor searches center on emotion, said Krebs. Tenor's \"Emotional Graph\" is a unique feature that maps GIF searches based on emotions people are searching.  Tenor is the first GIF search engine to create an ad platform for GIF searches, with advertisers paying between $100,000 and $500,000 for a sponsored GIF, per a recent profile in Bloomberg Businessweek. Tenor charges advertisers when their sponsored GIFs are shared, instead of when they're viewed, per Axios, suggesting shares are a more meaningful metric than views. About 70% of US internet users ages 8 to 64 (or 200 million people) know how to send a GIF, of which nearly half say they send at least one per week, according to Magid research.  Magid further estimated that mobile shares of GIFs could generate $1 billion to $2 billion in total ad revenues within two to three years, at a growth rate of 1,000%. Because GIFs are a highly shareable medium that condenses and communicates a large amount of information \u2014 especially emotion \u2014 for maximum impact, when people share a sponsored GIF, it's the equivalent of people sharing an ad, a rare and self-reinforcing power for any form of advertising. Further, because they're silent, GIFs transcend language barriers, so they can have potentially worldwide appeal, as shown by The New York Times' roundup of the top GIFs across five countries."}, {"url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/google-pay-is-officially-here-2018-2", "date": "2018-02-21T18:29:20Z", "host": "business-insider", "article": "BI Intelligence  This story was delivered to BI Intelligence \"Payments Briefing\" subscribers hours before appearing on Business Insider.

Google Pay \u2014 the tech giant's attempt to consolidate all of its payment offerings \u2014 is officially here, following an announcement in January and a pilot with several merchants.  The launch will begin with two major changes: Android Pay will be rebranded to Google Pay this week, and the app will be refreshed with a new look and some new features. In addition, Google Wallet, Google's peer-to-peer (P2P) payment offering, will be renamed Google Pay Send, and will also get an app refresh \u2014 though it'll be integrated into the main Google Pay soon. Next, Google will continue to build a cohesive cross-channel payment experience, which could help the firm improve engagement with its payment offerings by addressing pain points to adoption.  Google Pay streamlines enrollment. Right now, just 11% of eligible customers have tried Android Pay \u2014 the lowest rate of the three major phone-based services. Google Pay could help improve that standing by streamlining onboarding.  Customers at specific banking partners, like Bank of America, will be able to enroll in Google Pay directly through their mobile banking apps, and can begin using it without having to download a new app, according to TechCrunch. And in the future, customers will be able to automatically access cards they've already loaded into Chrome, which could bring more users to the service by limiting friction associated with smaller screens and challenges inputting information into mobile devices.  And if the app redesign can overcome consumer confusion, it could entice usage and grow adoption.  The new Google Pay seems to make for a simpler user experience. A refreshed home screen for the app still shows purchasing history, but also highlights offers and issues personalized recommendations about nearby stores that accept Google Pay. A second \"cards\" tab shows credit and debit cards, loyalty and gift cards, and offers, reflecting a user's available payment options.

A second \"cards\" tab shows credit and debit cards, loyalty and gift cards, and offers, reflecting a user's available payment options. That could improve engagement and boost the wallet's standing.In addition to low adoption, Android Pay also has engagement below its peers \u2014 nearly three-quarters of enrollees have used the wallet just once or do so inconsistently, and only 10% use it whenever possible. Leveraging a rebrand as an opportunity to combat pain points to engagement \u2014 like uncertainty about merchant acceptance, lack of incentives, or forgetfulness \u2014 could set Google Pay up for a rosier future, especially with more integrations, like P2P and cross-device options, on the horizon. That, in turn, could improve overall engagement with Google's payments tools, rather than those of competitors, while also touching a broad enough audience to help normalize mobile payments and move the industry forward.

Auto ads use machine learning to determine potential ad locations, types, and number of ads, while preserving the user experience, according to Google. Auto ads include formats like in-feed, display, and full-screen mobile ads, and can be integrated into publisher pages with a single line of code.  Auto ads are attractive to publishers for two key reasons:  They minimize the resources publishers spend on ad placement. Publishers don't need to devote as much staff to optimizing ad placement on their pages, as Auto ads will use machine learning and analytics to \"teach\" the system where to best place ads in the future, according to TechCrunch.  Publishers don't need to devote as much staff to optimizing ad placement on their pages, as Auto ads will use machine learning and analytics to \"teach\" the system where to best place ads in the future, according to TechCrunch. And they can help publishers better monetize their content.Auto ads may cause publishers to test ad placements in areas on their pages they might not have tested otherwise, and this can result in higher monetization. For example, some publishers participating in the beta testing of Auto ads saw average revenue increases of 5-15%, per MediaPost.  Auto ads can positively impact publishers' bottom lines, given AdSense is already used by tens of millions of publishers. Publishers are likely looking for additional ways to monetize their content amid Facebook's recent News Feed tweak that de-prioritizes their posts, which could hurt publishers' ability to generate ad revenue on Facebook.  Meanwhile, the release of Auto ads helps increase Google's influence over the digital ad environment. Although publishers can always opt out of using the tool, Google gains control over the types and number of ads publishers implement when they do use auto ads. This can help in Google's efforts to minimize the number of annoying ad experiences publishers serve, which can ultimately encourage users to keep browsing for content on the open web and not in the walled gardens of other platforms like Facebook or Twitter.

Google Assistant, Google's virtual voice assistant, now supports voice-enabled peer-to-peer (P2P) payments made with Google Pay, the company's own mobile wallet, which was recently rebranded from Android Pay, according to The Verge.  Users can tell Assistant to send money through Google Pay \u2014 the recipient needs to have a Google Pay account too \u2014 and then authenticate the transaction using their phone with a fingerprint or by entering their Google password.

The firm indicated that voice payments will also come to the Google Home smart speakers \"in the coming months.\"  Leveraging the Google Assistant could help Google Pay improve its competitive positioning.  A voice-enabled P2P feature could bring users to Google Pay.

This week, Google launched News Initiative, a global effort in which the company will commit $300 million over the next three years toward strengthening quality journalism, developing sustainable business models, and boosting tech innovation for news publishers, according to a Google blog post.  Imagined as a bid to help news organizations adapt to the digital age, the effort will bring products for publishers under one umbrella. Google already offers a similar news initiative for publishers in Europe. This latest one will expand those efforts worldwide.  The initiative will aim to address two key pursuits:  Google will help publishers to better monetize their services by driving subscriptions. Google is launching \"Subscribe with Google,\" which will make it easier for users to sign up for news subscriptions by streamlining the content discovery and payment process. A user's Google account will act as a central hub where all their news subscriptions will be stored and managed. Publishers will keep 85% to 95% of subscription revenue when readers subscribe through Google, per Bloomberg. Launch partners include The New York Times, The Washington Post, Financial Times, the USA Today Network, McClatchy, and GateHouse Media. Google is also testing a predictive tool called \"Propensity to Subscribe,\" based on machine learning, that will let publishers target users who Google determines are more likely to subscribe.

Google is also testing a predictive tool called \"Propensity to Subscribe,\" based on machine learning, that will let publishers target users who Google determines are more likely to subscribe. Google will also help to combat the proliferation of fake news online.As it works to surface legitimate news on its platforms, Google will proactively collaborate with journalism-focused institutes to help limit the spread of mis- and dis-information and improve media literacy among teens. Tasked with combating fake news, Google will launch the Disinfo Lab in collaboration with First Draft, a project of the Shorenstein Center at Harvard's Kennedy School. Google is also launching a media-literacy program, MediaWise, in collaboration with Poynter, Stanford University, and the Local Media Association, per the Poynter Institute's statement.  Like Google, Facebook has also launched initiatives aimed at elevating quality journalism. For example, Facebook has offered the Facebook Journalism Project, and last week Facebook said it would launch a designated news section in its Watch video hub for specific partners. At a time when 67% of US adults say they get news from social media, according to recent Pew research, these moves are especially crucial for digital platforms as 73% of voters also said they think \"Facebook should hold itself to the same standard as other media companies to only publish accurate stories,\" per a similar poll by the Factual Democracy Project.  However, the relationship between platforms and publishers remains largely imbalanced. Despite absorbing the majority of digital advertising dollars, Facebook and Google together represented less than 5% of the total average digital revenue for publishers in 2017, according to recent research by Digital Content Next. Recode's Peter Kafka argues that Google and Facebook are \"built to eviscerate publishers.\"  The tech platforms don't support publishers in the digital age so much as they compete with them. On the basis that publishers' fundamental currency is attention, Google and Facebook have done this far better than any publisher. Likewise, even multi-million-dollar journalism initiatives are barely a spending blip for the tech giants, given what either makes in digital ad revenues per quarter, much less per year \u2014 or three."}, {"url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/google-search-easter-eggs-2018-1", "date": "2018-01-25T16:38:36Z", "host": "business-insider", "article": "Shutterstock/Business Insider  Google has come a long, long way since its startup days, but it hasn't forgotten how to have fun.

Many security advocates tell Android users to only download apps from Google Play, the official store that Google operates for Android apps, in order to avoid viruses and spam. But even Google Play can fall victim to malicious code.  Security researchers at the cybersecurity software company Check Point discovered a new adware, dubbed \"LightsOut,\" hiding in 22 different flashlight and utility apps on Google Play, according to a new report released by the company on Friday.

Google did not respond to a request for comment.  Much like pop-up ads of the 1990's, LightsOut triggers ads on a user's phone, even when the user isn't in the app. These ads can be triggered by anything from a wi-fi connection, the end of a call, the plugging in of a charger, or locking of a screen, and continue to follow users even when they disable ads within the apps.  Some users with the adware said they were \"forced to press on ads to answer calls and perform other activities on their device.\" according to Check Point. One user also reported seeing the ads after he had purchased an ad-free version of the app.  While this type of adware is an illegal method of generating ad revenues, it's not technically a virus, according to Check Point.

Google  Google is finally releasing Hangouts Chat, its messaging app for business.  It's going right up against Microsoft Teams, Cisco Spark, and the $5 billion Silicon Valley startup Slack.  This is yet another attempt by Google to create a successful messaging platform. However, competition in this space is steep.  On Wednesday, Google is expected to make Hangouts Chat, its long-promised workplace chatroom tool for businesses, available to enterprise users of its G Suite productivity service. Google shared the news in a blog entry.  Hangouts Chat is available from the web browser, or from iOS and Android apps.

Google is aiming to make its Google Assistant voice platform more useful by enabling multi-step voice commands and more tightly integrating the assistant with smartphones and carriers, according to The Verge.  The forthcoming updates are aimed at giving developers, phone vendors, and wireless carriers the tools to create a more interactive user experience, reach more users, and create a more seamless voice assistant experience. These updates are expected to roll out in the coming weeks and throughout the year.  Here are some of the new tools and expanded features that Google is hoping will win over more consumers and voice developers:  Routine commands on the Google Home smart speaker. Smart home routines enable users to manage their connected devices with just a single voice command to Google Assistant. Saying \"Good morning\" to Google Assistant can simultaneously turn on the lights, increase the thermostat temperature, and begin outlining the user's day via Google Calendar, for example. The announcement comes on the heels of a similar offering from Amazon.  Google Assistant.

Expanded language support.Google Assistant will become available in over 30 languages by the end of the year, up from the eight languages it currently supports. This will enable Google Assistant to reach 95% of all active Android phones globally, according to Google VP of Product Nick Fox. Enabling Google Assistant to support more languages will help expand its global audience, and can spur usage of developers' apps.

This multilingual feature will initially only be available in English, French, and German, but is expected to expand to more languages over time. Deeper Assistant integration with phones and carriers. Google is working with smartphone vendors, starting with Xiaomi, LG, and Sony, to integrate Google Assistant with the specific hardware and software of smartphones. Users will be able to ask Google Assistant to launch a specific camera feature, issuing commands like, \"Hey Google, launch my camera's augmented reality mode,\" for example. Google is also working with wireless carriers, the first being Sprint, Vodafone, Telus, and Koodo, to integrate their services with Assistant. This could allow users to ask Google Assistant to check how much data is left on their monthly allotment, or even add more data to their plan.  The latest announcements could be key in helping Google bolster its voice assistant platform and spur adoption of the technology. A major challenge facing the overall voice assistant market is that most consumers rely on them to conduct simple tasks, like getting weather updates or setting timers, while complex and lengthy interactions lag. By creating new experiences that expand Google Assistant's ability to complete more complex tasks, the usefulness of the platform will increase, and engagement can grow as a result. As voice assistants become more intelligent, and developers create better and more useful ways to integrate them with consumers' lives, voice will cement itself as the primary way consumers interact with their devices.  Business Insider Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has written a detailed report on voice apps that explores the two major viable voice app stores. It identifies the three big issues voice apps are facing \u2014 discoverability, monetization, and retention \u2014 and presents possible short-term solutions ahead of industry-wide fixes.  Here are some of the key takeaways from the report:  The market for smart speakers and voice platforms is expanding rapidly. The installed base of smart speakers and the volume of voice apps that can be accessed on them each saw significant gains in 2017. But the new format and the emerging voice ecosystems that are making their way into smart speaker-equipped homes is so far failing to align with consumer needs.  Voice app development is a virtuous cycle with several broken components. The addressable consumer market is expanding, which is prompting more brands and developers to developer voice apps, but the ability to monetize and iterate those voice apps is limited, which could inhibit voice app growth.  Monetization is only one broken component of the voice app ecosystem. Discoverability and user retention are equally problematic for voice app development.  While the two major voice app ecosystems \u2014 Amazon's and Google's \u2014 have some Band-Aid solutions and workarounds, their options for improving monetization, discoverability, and retention for voice apps are currently limited.  There are some strategies that developers and brands can employ in the near term ahead of more robust tools and solutions.  In full, the report:  Sizes the current voice app ecosystem.

To be the first to know, please click here.  Google recently announced two updates to Google Tez, its proprietary mobile payment platform that it launched in India last year.  Google Tez is gaining a chat function. Some users are starting to gain access to a chat function in the app, allowing users to have conversations on the same platform they send peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions on, according to TechCrunch.  Some users are starting to gain access to a chat function in the app, allowing users to have conversations on the same platform they send peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions on, according to TechCrunch. It will also get a tap-and-pay capability. Users will soon be able to load their cards into the app and enable tap-and-pay in the payments app, according to Times of India. Google Tez will gain all the features of Google Pay, Google's mobile wallet geared toward consumers in other countries.  Google is likely responding to what other major players in the space are doing. Tez, which leverages India's Unified Payments Interface (UPI), a government-backed system that allows for instant, bank-to-bank transfers in India, initially launched as a P2P payment app and gained traction fast, adding 7.5 million users in its first five weeks after launch.  Since then, Google has started adding more payment capabilities to reflect what other players, like Paytm, India's largest mobile wallet, are offering. For example, Paytm launched a chat feature called Paytm Inbox in its app last year, and also provides bill payments capabilities, which Tez recently added as well.  These new updates are likely a competitive positioning play by Tez against giants Paytm and Facebook-owned WhatsApp, which recently starting offering payments functionalities in India. WhatsApp has a huge user base of over 200 million active daily users, and Paytm has 225 million users in India because it was established in the country when 86% of cash was removed from circulation in November 2016. India still has room for newer players like Google Tez. Although Google Tez launched well after the demonetization, its rapid growth could be an indication that the market has room for more players, and that its new features could drive further adoption. And despite demonetization, cash is still frequently used in India.  While some of the major players have millions of users, just 14% of adults in India make mobile payments weekly, and only 6% do so daily, demonstrating that there's still room for growth in the market. And it could mean that while Tez is adding new, popular features that other players have already launched, it can still see use, and Tez could continue to rapidly onboard new users.  In the US, the in-store mobile wallet space is becoming increasingly crowded. Most customers have an option provided by their smartphone vendor, like Apple, Android, or Samsung Pay. But those are often supplemented by a myriad of options from other players, ranging from tech firms like PayPal, to banks and card issuers, to major retailers and restaurants.  With that proliferation of options, one would expect to see a surge in adoption. But that's not the case \u2014 though BI Intelligence projects that US in-store mobile payments volume will quintuple in the next five years, usage is consistently lagging below expectations, with estimates for 2019 falling far below what we expected just two years ago.  As such, despite promising factors driving gains, including the normalization of NFC technology and improved incentive programs to encourage adoption and engagement, it's important for wallet providers and groups trying to break into the space to address the problems still holding mobile wallets back. These issues include customer satisfaction with current payment methods, limited repeat purchasing, and consumer confusion stemming from fragmentation. But several wallets, like Apple Pay, Starbucks' app, and Samsung Pay, are outperforming their peers, and by delving into why, firms can begin to develop best practices and see better results.

The adware, dubbed LightsOut by security researchers, would spam Android phones with illegal advertisements, whether or not the app was in use.  Google Play has since removed all 22 apps.  Many security advocates tell Android users to only download apps from Google Play, the official store that Google operates for Android apps, in order to avoid viruses and spam. But even Google Play can fall victim to malicious code.  Security researchers at the cybersecurity software company Check Point discovered a new adware, dubbed \"LightsOut,\" hiding in 22 different flashlight and utility apps on Google Play, according to a new report released by the company on Friday. Check Point estimates that the adware affected between 1.5 million and 7.5 million downloads.  The apps have since been removed from Google Play, according to Check Point. Google did not respond to a request for comment.  Much like pop-up ads of the 1990's, LightsOut triggers ads on a user's phone, even when the user isn't in the app. These ads can be triggered by anything from a wi-fi connection, the end of a call, the plugging in of a charger, or locking of a screen, and continue to follow users even when they disable ads within the apps.  Some users with the adware said they were \"forced to press on ads to answer calls and perform other activities on their device.\" according to Check Point. One user also reported seeing the ads after he had purchased an ad-free version of the app.  While this type of adware is an illegal method of generating ad revenues, it's not technically a virus, according to Check Point. The difference is that viruses self-replicate, whereas adware lives inside of the code for specific apps, and goes away once the app is deleted."}, {"url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/google-improving-mobile-search-ios-users-2018-3", "date": "2018-03-07T17:03:36Z", "host": "business-insider", "article": "BII  This story was delivered to BI Intelligence Apps and Platforms Briefing subscribers hours before appearing on Business Insider.

The new updates \u2014 Google Search app extension for iMessage, suggestions for Google Search on Safari, and support for drag and drop on the iPad \u2014 will help Google ensure that its mobile search platform remains a primary mode of mobile discovery, regardless of the user's operating system.  Here's an overview of the updates Google announced on Monday:  Google Search app for iPhone and iPad now includes an iMessage extension. This means that iPhone and iPad users can Google Search from within iMessage, and then quickly add their search results to their iMessage conversations to share with others. There's also a GIF button for quickly searching for GIFs to share. The new extension makes it easier to share Google Search results via iMessage.

Users on iOS 11 can drag and drop to effortlessly move text, images, and links to and from the Google app. For example, a simple tap and hold on an article will now allow a user to drag the link into other apps like iMessage or Notes.  A focus on enhancing the mobile search experience for iOS users is important for two key reasons:  Mobile is the most used medium for searches. Google found that more than half of all web searches are on mobile, mostly through micro-moments, or when individuals reflexively turn to a device to act on a need to learn something, do something, or discover something. By incorporating Google Search into iMessage, Google can satisfy the immediate need of consumers to share information when chatting with friends.

By incorporating Google Search into iMessage, Google can satisfy the immediate need of consumers to share information when chatting with friends. Mobile search is the main driver of Google's advertising business. While Google doesn't break out mobile as a percentage of its total revenue, Google's CFO Ruth Porat mentioned that the channel was largely responsible for driving the 24% YoY growth in total revenue it reported for Q4 2017. And despite being limited to mobile web searches, Apple users account for nearly half of Google's mobile search revenue.  The smartphone is getting smarter as tech and internet companies inject increasingly sophisticated computer vision and object recognition functions into their hardware and software. The ability to \"understand\" what the user is pointing their mobile camera at and \"read\" the image has opened the door for visual search.  Foreseeing the potential for mobile visual search to create new revenue opportunities, brands are attempting to harness the smartphone camera's increasing sophistication to engage with consumers and drive sales.  In this report, Business Insider Intelligence analyzes the developing technologies behind mobile visual search and its value to businesses and brands. The report also assesses risks and opportunities inherent in developing a visual search strategy, provides a list of companies that are working in the space, and discusses what they've accomplished so far.  Here are some of the key takeaways from the report:  There is strong evidence that mobile visual search technology will take off in the near future, including growing access to technology, strong usage rates of camera-related apps, and early indication of potential revenue growth.  In some instances, visual search is faster and more accurate than text or voice, as it cuts through consumer-introduced ambiguities.  The mobile visual search ecosystem is growing, with a slew of enabling platforms, native apps, and internet companies all broadening their expertise in the field.  Leading internet search companies, including Google and Baidu, are in a race to capture the mobile visual search market as it begins to eat into traditional forms of search.  The smartphone is the perfect launchpad for visual search technology, but new form factors, like smartglasses, hold great potential.

It's not clear if or how Google will use the technology, but Brian Behlendorf, an expert on the technology, thinks the company will offer a blockchain product through its Google Cloud service.  Blockchains are designed to be decentralized, but one that's linked to a public-cloud service could actually make sense, Behlendorf said.  Google has long been fond of experimentation, so it should be no surprise the internet giant is looking into what blockchain technology could do for its cloud business.  Several different teams inside the company are examining the hyped technology, which is the hard-to-edit digital ledger system that underlies bitcoin, ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, a Google representative said. But the representative declined to share details.  \"Like many new technologies, we have individuals in various teams exploring potential uses of blockchain but it's way too early for us to speculate about any possible uses or plans,\" the Google representative said.  Fortunately, it doesn't take inside information to imagine what Google may have in store. Indeed, thinking through how Google might use blockchain technology is something Brian Behlendorf, executive director of the open-source blockchain project Hyperledger, has been doing a lot lately.  Behlendorf's hunch? Google's going to offer blockchain technology as a product available through its Google Cloud service. Just as Google Cloud customers today can easily set up databases through the service or use it to access Google's machine learning technology, they might be able to someday set up a blockchain through it.  Behlendorf doesn't speak for Google. But he's in a good position to speculate on what it might do. His organization, after all, works with companies including IBM and Oracle to develop their enterprise-grade blockchain offerings.  The blockchain would be for businesses, not cloud infrastructure  Google could potentially develop a blockchain system from scratch. But that could take a lot of time and resources, so the company might just use one that's already been developed, potentially even one from Hyperledger. Hyperledger has two different open-source blockchain systems \u2014 Fabric and Sawtooth \u2014 that it offers for enterprises to use for their projects.  Either way, its service would likely allow Google Cloud clients to set up a blockchain ledger and authorize different users \u2014 or nodes \u2014 to make entries on it.  \"The basic idea is you might take something like Hyperledger Fabric or Sawtooth and go to a company or set of companies and say, 'We will set up your nodes on a permission ledger for a fee,'\" Behlendorf said.  Samantha Lee/Business Insider  Strategically, it would make sense for Google to add a blockchain product to its cloud service. Google's cloud-related products \u2014 which include Google Docs and a broad range of other services \u2014 account for $1 billion in quarterly revenue. But Google Cloud itself is in third place in the cloud-computing market, trailing behind Amazon Web Services and Microsoft's Azure, and it could use something to help set its service apart from the leaders.  A public cloud blockchain won't necessarily be decentralized  Hosting a blockchain product on a public cloud service may sound strange if you know something about the digital-ledger technology. One of the big selling points of blockchains is that they're decentralized.  Exact copies of blockchain ledgers are stored in multiple places, typically on different computers or nodes. In the case of bitcoin's blockchain, the number of nodes is in the thousands. A change to a ledger won't be recognized unless multiple nodes agree on the change.  By contrast, public clouds, by their nature, are services that centralize data from multiple companies or users.  Here's how changes get made on a blockchain. Click to enlarge. Samantha Lee/Business Insider  Despite that apparent contradiction, Behlendorf said users shouldn't be worried about a public cloud-based blockchain.  Just because a blockchain may start in a public cloud doesn't necessarily mean it can't be decentralized. Indeed, if Google offers a blockchain product through Google Cloud, it likely will embrace decentralization and allow customers to set up nodes for their blockchain ledgers elsewhere, including on other public cloud services such as AWS, he said.  That may seem counterintuitive that Google would allow its blockchain product to be accessed through competing cloud services. But it would almost have to offer that flexibility, Behlendorf said. After all, many businesses operate worldwide and will want their blockchains to be accessible wherever they operate, but Google Cloud isn't accessible in China, because the country bans Google.  Besides, the main reason for decentralization is to ensure trust among parties that don't know each other. You may not know who's operating a particular node on the bitcoin blockchain, but you can trust that the person has an unadulterated copy of the ledger if it matches up with those on every other node in the system.  But public cloud services don't have the same bar for establishing the trust of users. People already know Amazon, Microsoft, Google and trust their services. If you would use a cloud service to store information about your business, you should feel comfortable putting a blockchain on it as well, Behlendorf said.  In fact, it's already happening. While neither AWS or Azure offers a blockchain product, people already host blockchains on those cloud services, he said.  Still not sure what a blockchain is?

Yet revenues from Microsoft's Productivity and Business Processes segment, which includes Microsoft Office, the Office 365 cloud suite, and LinkedIn, grew 25% year-over-year and its Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes its Azure platform, grew 15% during the same period. Revenue from its personal computing segment posted modest growth of 2%.  Still, MacMillan raised his price target to $105, up 12% from its current price.

If your business is already using cloud storage from one of those three companies, Microsoft will give you OneDrive for free for the duration of your contract with them.  The fine print: Your company needs to have more than 500 users, and you can't already be a customer of OneDrive or the Office 365 cloud productivity suite.  Google, Box, and Dropbox, be warned: Microsoft is coming for your customers.  On Tuesday, Microsoft announced a new offer to entice companies to use its OneDrive cloud storage service. If you're a business that's already using any of those three competitors, Microsoft will give you its OneDrive for Business service for free until your contract with the other company ends.  The promotional offer comes with some caveats: You have to commit to 500 seats or more, meaning small businesses won't really be able to take advantage. You have to not already be a customer of OneDrive, or of the Microsoft Office 365 productivity suite. And the deal is only good through June 18th.  The big idea is to give customers a taste of what Microsoft can offer, without having to worry about their existing commitments to those other vendors. Microsoft is confident enough that those big customers will sign on, it seems, that they're willing to swallow the cost. In general, Microsoft is seeing solid growth in its subscription cloud businesses, bolstering its confidence here.  As for why customers would want to make the change: Microsoft is touting the deep integrations between its own OneDrive service and Microsoft Office. While Microsoft Office is compatible with cloud storage from those other companies to a certain degree, there are some special features that Microsoft reserves for its own offerings.  For instance, you need OneDrive if you want to have multiple authors simultaneously work on a single Office document in real-time from the computer or smartphone apps. And OneDrive integrates with other Microsoft apps like the team portal SharePoint, so files stay in sync across the suite.  Plus, Microsoft Global Senior Director Seth Patton hypes up the security of OneDrive, saying that it means most customers' most stringent requirements.  \"That's a pretty big deal,\" Patton tells Business Insider.  Still, with this offer, Microsoft might find itself preaching to the choir somewhat. While Box, Dropbox, and Google's G Suite certainly have a certain number of large-enterprise customers, they're mostly known for appealing to smaller and midsize businesses.  Microsoft is already generally considered to be the leader in large companies, given the fact that its Office suite is, and remains, the gold standard in the productivity market. Still, with analysts urging Dropbox to pursue an enterprise-focused strategy ahead of its purported IPO, perhaps Microsoft is just trying to consolidate its lead ahead of time.  After this offer expires, customer will have to pay for OneDrive for Business like usual. Plans start at $5 per user per month, or else you could opt in for a $12.50 per user per month subscription to the Office 365 cloud productivity suite \u2014 at which point you'd get access to all of the Office applications, like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, too."}, {"url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/windows-phone-7-and-8-push-notifications-disabled-2018-2", "date": "2018-02-20T22:17:42Z", "host": "business-insider", "article": "Microsoft's Joe Belfiore holds up Windows Phones at the Microsoft Build 2014 event. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images  Smartphones running Windows Phone 7.5 or Windows 8 are no longer getting push notifications, after Microsoft announced it's pulled support.  Windows Phone 8.1 will work as usual \"at this time,\" and the current Windows 10 Mobile is still fully supported.  However, Microsoft has said that Windows 10 Mobile is no longer a focus, and users shouldn't expect new features or hardware.  It's no secret by now that Microsoft's smartphone ambitions are basically over, with its current Windows 10 Mobile operating system barely on life support.  So here's another nail in the coffin. On Monday, Microsoft announced in a blog post that any phone running the older Windows Phone 7.5 or 8 operating systems will no longer receive push notifications. Plus, the \"Find my phone\" function on those operating systems will no longer work, either.  This isn't necessarily going to affect a whole lot of users: Windows Phone 7.5 was first released in 2011, and Windows Phone 8 dropped in 2012. Despite the nomenclature, they were totally different operating systems: Windows Phone 7.5 hardware couldn't upgrade to Windows Phone 8. Neither operating system found a huge audience at the time, and there likely aren't many phones out there using it today \u2014 which is part of why Microsoft currently finds itself in this suboptimal smartphone situation in the first place.  If you're one of the few using the more recent Windows Phone 8.1, which dropped in 2014, Microsoft writes that everything will still work as usual \"at this time.\" The phrasing here keeps the door open that things could change in the not-so-distant future.  Meanwhile, Windows 10 Mobile, which launched in 2015, is still fully supported by Microsoft. At least, technically: While all of its current features still work the same as they ever did, Microsoft announced in October that users can only expect security patches and minor improvements, not major new features or new hardware.  So, yes, here's another milestone in the march to the grave for Windows on smartphones.  Hope may still spring, though: Rumor is that Microsoft is working on a new, foldable tablet device that could also function as a smartphone. If and when that device comes to market, though, it will almost certainly not be running anything we would today recognize as a Windows phone operating system."}, {"url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-windows-10-s-dead-or-alive-2018-2", "date": "2018-02-09T00:28:49Z", "host": "business-insider", "article": "The Microsoft Surface Laptop, released in 2017, was the first Windows 10 S PC. Melia Robinson/Business Insider  Microsoft fans are abuzz after a report indicates that Windows 10 S \u2014 its newest version of the Windows operating system \u2014 is dead.  The truth is more complicated, with a person familiar with Microsoft's thinking telling us that the company's bet on Windows 10 S hasn't changed, and that it's all about semantics.  Instead of a dedicated Windows 10 S, Microsoft will reportedly bring a similar S Mode to all existing versions of Windows 10.  Windows 10 S is a streamlined version of Windows that brings better performance and battery life, at the cost of only being able to install software from the Windows Store.  Last weekend, long-time Microsoft blogger Brad Sams reported that Windows 10 S\u2014 the latest version of the operating system, launched in mid-2017 \u2014 is, for all intents and purposes, dead.  The report set off all kinds of conversations in the world of Microsoft fans, who wonder what it could mean for the future of Windows 10 itself. The truth, Business Insider has learned, is a little bit more complicated, and depends to some extent on your perspective.  The idea of Windows 10 S is that it offers a smoother, more secure, and more streamlined experience, with the added benefit of extending a laptop's battery life. The tradeoff is that it can only install apps from the Windows Store, rather than from the internet, a disc, or anywhere else you might get software.  You can easily go from Windows 10 S to the more traditional and fully-featured Windows 10 Pro \u2014 but it might cost you. Owners of the Microsoft Surface Laptop can currently make the switch for free as part of a limited-time promotion, but otherwise, you might have to pay $49 for the transition.  In the bigger picture, Microsoft was positioning Windows 10 S as a way to chip away at Apple's and Google's presences in the classroom \u2014 Google's low-cost Chromebook laptops, in particular, beat out Windows in the American classroom by offering cheap, secure laptops that also offer superior battery life.  Thurott cites internal Microsoft research showing that 60% of all Windows 10 S users actually stick with it and don't switch.  Glass half-empty or half-full?  Now, here's where things get a little tricky. Because whether or not Windows 10 S is dead kind of depends on your perspective.  Thurott reports that Microsoft will no longer offer Windows 10 S as a standalone operating system. You could never buy it yourself, but computer manufacturers (OEMs, or \"original equipment manufacturers\" in industry parlance) could license it from Microsoft to pre-install on the computers they sold to customers.  Instead, Microsoft will push a so-called S Mode onto all versions of the Windows 10 operating system, reports Thurott. When enabled, S Mode will make any version of Windows 10 act like Windows 10 S, with all of the benefits and tradeoffs therein.  Microsoft had previously said that S Mode would be coming to Windows 10 for businesses in future updates; this would just bring it to all of the consumer versions, too.  OEMs will theoretically be able to choose whether or not to ship their PCs with S Mode on or off \u2014 opening the possibility that you might have to pay up to disable S Mode, in the same way that you usually have to pay $49 to go from Windows 10 S to Windows 10 Pro today.  So in that sense, yes, Windows 10 S is dead.  But that's not how Microsoft sees things. Microsoft has always seen Windows 10 S as more of a marketing distinction than a separate, standalone operating system, according to people familiar with the company's thinking.  From Microsoft's perspective, it appears, there never really was a \"Windows 10 S,\" just a version of Windows 10 Pro with S Mode enabled. To that end, bringing S Mode to other versions, like the entry-level Windows 10 Home and Windows 10 Education, would actually bring the original promise of Windows 10 S to more PCs.  In a philosophical sense, then Windows 10 S isn't dead. In fact, quite the opposite \u2014 bringing S Mode to every version of Windows 10 would take it even further.  Officially, here's what a Microsoft spokesperson has to say about all of this: \"Windows 10 S provides a streamlined, secure and battery efficient experience that we believe is a great choice for many customers. We'll share more about what's next for Windows 10 S when we're ready.\"  But Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, thinks Microsoft's focus on Windows 10 S and S Mode proves that the company is trying to retain control of the operating system.  \"I believe that Microsoft would like a world where everyone starts on Windows S and all key, preferred services come through Microsoft and then everyone else who wants more flexibility or features pays Microsoft for that,\" says Moorhead."}, {"url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-bill-gates-believes-apple-should-unlock-iphones-2018-2", "date": "2018-02-13T12:22:00Z", "host": "business-insider", "article": "Microsoft's chairman, founder, and former CEO, Bill Gates.

On Monday, a court issued a temporary restraining order which prevents McIntyre from working at Microsoft until further notice.  Using Microsoft's own arguments from a previous lawsuit, IBM is arguing that its diversity strategy is both confidential and \"potentially damaging\" if shared with its competitors.  Tech companies have a less than stellar record hiring women and minorities. But these companies will apparently do whatever it takes \u2014 including launching a legal fight \u2014 to hire one type of person: a Chief Diversity Officer.  IBM is suing its former top diversity officer Lindsay-Rae McIntyre after she got poached by Microsoft, in a case that could prove just how important diversity, recruitment, and retention has become for tech companies.  McIntyre, who joined IBM in 2006, was named chief diversity officer of Microsoft on Sunday, after serving in the same role and as VP of human resources at IBM. IBM, in its complaint, argues that McIntyree had access to diversity data, strategies, methodologies and initiatives that are confidential, and that she \"will use, rely on or divulge\" these strategies in her new role.  On Monday, IBM was granted a temporary restraining order in New York federal court, which prevents McIntyre from working for Microsoft until the court decides otherwise.  \"McIntyre was at the center of highly confidential and competitively sensitive information that has fueled IBM's success in these areas,\" a representative for IBM said in a statement. \"While we understand Microsoft's need to deal with mounting criticism of its record on diversity, IBM intends to fully enforce Ms. McIntyre's non-compete agreement to protect our competitive information.\"  IBM is using another Microsoft lawsuit to argue its case  At the heart of IBM's complaint is an on-going lawsuit from 2015, Moussouris v. Microsoft Corporation. The lawsuit alleges that Microsoft systematically discriminated against women in technical and engineering roles at the company when it came to evaluations, pay, and promotions.  The briefings for that lawsuit wrapped up on February 9. Now it is up to the courts to decide whether or not the case has class-action status.  As part of its non-compete case, IBM is looking to use Microsoft's own legal arguments from the Moussouris lawsuit to make its own point.  In April 2017, to prevent certain information from being released publicly in the discovery process, Microsoft argued that such diversity data is \"not merely confidential, but so sensitive and potentially damaging to Microsoft if revealed to its competitors (e.g., IBM), that the court should take the extraordinary measure of putting the information under seal,\" according to IBM's complaint.  Microsoft ultimately got some of the documents in the case sealed, and others released with redactions.  In its official response to IBM, Microsoft argued that enforcing McIntyre's non-compete agreement is \"draconian,\" as McIntyre has promised not to share confidential information with Microsoft.  It's worth noting that IBM's employee ranks are not a paragon of diversity: According to IBM's website, women comprised 31.8% of its global workforce in 2016."}, {"url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-teams-gets-general-motors-technicolor-as-customers-2018-3", "date": "2018-03-12T13:00:00Z", "host": "business-insider", "article": "AP  Microsoft Teams, the company's workplace chat app, now has 200,000 organizations using it \u2014 including General Motors and Technicolor, both announced as customers on Monday.  General Motors deployed Microsoft Teams to about 19,000 employees.  Microsoft Teams is also adding some new features, like a searchable transcript of every single conference call, or a one-touch button to blur the background on a video call.  Microsoft says it has an edge over competitors like Slack or Google because Teams comes standard as part of the Office 365 suite, giving it a huge pricing advantage over others.  One year ago, Microsoft officially launched Teams: a workplace chat app that brought the tech titan into contention with $5.1 billion startup Slack, Cisco, and more recently, Google.  To celebrate the milestone, Microsoft is announcing some new customers \u2014 including General Motors, which has deployed Microsoft Teams to about 19,000 employees since December 2017. Technicolor, too, has gone all-in on Teams. All told, Microsoft says that there are 200,000 organizations (meaning businesses, schools, and other entities) using Teams.

Microsoft  She further says that Microsoft Teams is seeing strong adoption from both existing Office 365 customers, and from those who hadn't previously been using the suite. In the latter case, she says, it's that value that's drawing them in: They might have started by looking for a chat tool, but choose Microsoft because then they get Word and PowerPoint, too.  In a larger sense, Wright says that they're finding that Teams isn't replacing e-mail, so much as \"right-sizing\" it. Customers are fnding the right places where e-mail makes sense, and the spots where a chat is just faster and easier. She says that it's reflective of Microsoft trying to match modern needs.  \"It's representative of the way the future world is working,\" says Wright.

Stephen Lam/Stringer MOSCOW (Reuters) - Two of Microsoft's official distributors in Russia have imposed restrictions on sales of Microsoft software to more than 200 Russian companies following new U.S. sanctions, according to notifications circulated by the distributors.  While much of the focus around U.S. sanctions has been on ways they are being skirted, the moves by the Russian distributors show how tougher restrictions that came into force on Nov. 28 are starting to bite.  The new measures cut the duration of loans that can be offered to Russian financial firms subject to sanctions to 14 days from 30 days and to 60 days from 90 days for Russian energy companies on a U.S. sanctions list.  Previously, the restrictions had mainly affected Western banks lending to Russian firms but with such short financing periods, swathes of companies supplying goods and services to Russian clients fear they could fall foul of the rules too.  It is routine in Russia for suppliers to wait weeks or even months to get paid after submitting invoices for goods and services.  Some Western firms have been advised by lawyers that the U.S. Treasury Department could, in theory, take the view this constituted financing in violation of the sanctions, according to several people involved in the discussions.  One of the two Microsoft distributors, a Russian company called Merlion, said in its notification to partners that all sanctioned buyers of Microsoft licenses must pay within tight deadlines, or even pay upfront in some cases.  The second distributor, RRC, said in its notification, seen by Reuters, that \"serious restrictions are being introduced\" on Microsoft orders from firms subject to U.S. sanctions.  Both Merlion and RRC cited rules stemming from the new package of U.S. sanctions - signed into law on Aug. 2 for Russia's involvement in Ukraine and cyber attacks - as the reason for the additional restrictions.  Neither Merlion nor RRC responded to Reuters questions.  Microsoft said in a statement to Reuters: \"Microsoft has a strong commitment to complying with legal requirements and has robust processes around the world to help ensure that our partners are in compliance as well.\"  In response to Reuters questions, a spokesman for the U.S. Treasury Department, which oversees the enforcement of sanctions, referred to its published guidance.  The guidance from the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) states that U.S. firms can conduct transactions with companies on the sanctions list as long as the payment terms do not exceed the permitted loan duration.  \"In the event that a U.S. person believes that it may not receive payment in full by the end of the relevant payment period, the U.S. person should contact OFAC to determine whether a license or other authorization is required,\" it said.  'Sectorial sanctions'  The United States can impose a civil penalty on violators of $250,000 or double the amount of the offending transaction if it is greater. If convicted of wilful violation, offenders face a fine up to $1 million, or 20 years in jail, or both.  Microsoft did not respond to Reuters questions about whether it had initiated the restrictions introduced by two of its Russian distributors.  Microsoft lists nine other official distributors of its main software products in Russia in the same category of partner companies as RRC and Merlion. One, Softline, declined to comment on whether it had introduced stricter payment rules. The others did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.  Reuters reported in October that software produced by Microsoft had been acquired by state organizations and firms in Russia and Crimea, despite sanctions barring U.S.-based companies from doing business with them.  That case, and several similar ones reported by Reuters, highlighted gaps between the sanctions and their enforcement.  The U.S. government operates two lists of firms subject to sanctions. U.S.-based entities are banned from doing almost all forms of business with firms on Washington's Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list.  A second list known as the Sectoral Sanctions Identifications (SSI) list covers 224 mostly Russian firms and their subsidiaries in the banking, energy and defense sectors which are subject to financial restrictions.  They include major Russian companies such as oil giant Rosneft, natural gas producer Novatek and Sberbank, Russia's biggest lender.  While the lending rules for financial and energy firms have been tightened, restrictions on financing for Russian defense manufacturers were left unchanged at 30 days though the new sanctions toughened the penalties for any violations.  Tougher rules  The notification from Microsoft distributor Merlion dated Nov. 29, the day after the new lending rules come into force, said orders would only be fulfilled for financial sector buyers once it had confirmation full payment had been received.  For the defense sector, it said orders would be fulfilled only if partners confirmed payment would be made within 30 days of the software license being activated. For energy sector clients, confirmation of payment within 60 days was required.  \"If we do not receive from you documents confirming payment on orders from the defense and energy sectors, the order could be viewed by the vendor as not complying with the processing procedure and rejected,\" Merlion's notification said.  RRC did not spell out the new restrictions in its notification, sent by email last month to its partners.  \"In the event that you have buyers from the following sectors of the economy (financial, defense, energy) and they are in the sanctions list, you are requested IN ADVANCE to contact your RRC manager for further instructions.\"  \"In connection with this, serious restrictions are being introduced on the placing of, and payment for, orders for Microsoft products ... placed by these buyers (and also their subsidiaries and affiliated companies),\" the notification said.  Blacklisted by association  Besides the tighter lending rules and other new restrictions, a change of wording in the U.S. sanctions package is also sending ripples through the Russian economy.  The previous wording was the U.S. president \"may impose\" penalties if rules are violated. That has now changed to \"shall impose\" penalties, unless it is not in the national interest.  Lawyers who advise clients on U.S. sanctions compliance said this meant it was more likely Washington would impose penalties on foreign entities doing prohibited business with a company on the sanctions list.  In response, companies are trying to put as much distance as possible between themselves and Russian entities on the U.S. blacklist, fearing they could end up on it too by association, bankers, lawyers, officials, and business executives said.  Some companies are conducting audits to find out if their partners deal with any sanctioned entities and are, in some cases, halting those relationships, according to a sanctions lawyer and an executive with a large industrial firm.  \"Even Chinese companies started to ask,\" said a senior source close to the Kremlin and the Russian government, alluding to the fact some Chinese companies have until now continued to do deals even where many Western firms have pulled back.  At the same time, companies that are on the sanctions list, or believe they may be added, are looking for intermediary firms that would allow their partners to keep working with them, albeit at arm's length.  A person who works closely with a billionaire Russian oligarch said he assessed the risk the oligarch's business would be put under U.S. sanctions was only 10 percent. Even so, he said, the business was taking precautions so it can keep operating if Washington does blacklist it.  \"We are establishing non-affiliated business units. Or deal with large local partners,\" said the source, who declined to be identified to avoid attracting attention to his boss's business.  A Russian finance ministry source said he expected an uptick in the number of shell companies being set up as a mechanism to bypass the expanded sanctions.  Two executives from two top-20 Russian banks said they viewed the fact their clients included Rosneft as a risk. One said many of the bank's clients had started to ask whether the Rosneft ties exposed the lender to sanctions risk.

Microsoft says that a Windows PC is more capable than a Chromebook \u2014 Windows 10 lets you run software like Minecraft or the full version of Microsoft Office.  Minecraft is getting a new chemistry module for students.  Google has all but captured the market for American classrooms \u2014 analyst firm Futuresource estimates that in the third quarter of 2017, Google's low-cost Chromebooks accounted for 59.8% of the laptop market for K-12 education, compared to Microsoft Windows devices' 22.3% share.  But Microsoft would be quick to remind you that this doesn't tell the whole story: That 22.3% share is up from 18.4% the quarter before, and Microsoft says, up 4% from the same period in 2016. And, worldwide, Windows still reigns supreme: In that same third quarter of 2017, Windows accounted for 66.5% of global K-12 classroom PC shipments.  Now, Microsoft is striking back against Google's domestic dominance, with a series of announcements designed to make Windows PCs, Microsoft Office 365, and even the Minecraft video game sensation more appealing for education customers at home and abroad.  Chief among those announcements: New laptops for the classroom, priced between $189 and $299, manufactured by partners Lenovo and JP. These laptops will run Windows 10 S, a version of the operating system streamlined for better battery life and performance \u2014 at the big tradeoff of only being able to install apps from the Microsoft Store.  Microsoft Corporate VP Yusuf Mehdi tells Business Insider that Microsoft is trying to undercut the price advantage of Chromebooks, which often sell for under $299. But because these PCs can run the full versions of Windows software, including Microsoft Office and Minecraft, they offer \"none of the compromises of a Chromebook.\"  Mehdi gives Google credit where he believes credit is due: He says that Chromebooks didn't actually steal any marketshare away from Microsoft, per se; Google just discovered a previously-unmet demand for low-priced laptops and \"made it affordable to have a computer in the classroom.\" And although Apple has had a strong business in schools, but its products are much more expensive.  A new Chemistry Module for Minecraft: Education Edition will let students play around with both atoms and chemical compounds, in the safety of the virtual world. Microsoft  Now, says Mehdi, the burden is on Microsoft to go out and prove that a Windows machine is more capable than a Chromebook of the same price. Many of the low-cost Windows devices announced on Monday will boast touchscreens and stylus support. Some, will even be compatible with certain virtual reality headsets, a feature schools love, Mehdi adds.  Beyond the hardware, Mehdi highlights updates to the software in the Office 365 for Education suite. For instance, the Microsoft Teams chat tool is getting an iOS and Android app for education users. And Minecraft: Education Edition, which is already widely used to teach programming, is getting a chemistry module for students to perform science experiments in the safety of the virtual world.  According to Futuresource, the time could be right for Microsoft, too: Many schools bought their Chromebooks for students in 2014 and 2015, meaning that they could be looking to do a wide-scale replacement in 2018. That's an opportunity for Microsoft to convince them to switch to Windows \u2014 an opportunity he says the company doesn't intend to squander.  \"We finally feel like we have a strong value proposition,\" says Mehdi."}, {"url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-ceo-saya-nadella-congratulates-college-intern-for-viral-linkedin-internship-post-2018-2", "date": "2018-02-15T22:26:12Z", "host": "business-insider", "article": "Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft Corp.

Stephen Brashear/Getty Images Good morning! Here is the tech news you need to know this Thursday.  1. Snap is reportedly planning a layoff round to its engineering department, the largest to date. About 100 people are said to be affected, which is less than 10% of the unit.  2. Google has released a preview of Android P with support for an iPhone X-style notch. The new build has updates to Android's Quick Settings and notifications, as well as other design tweaks.  3. Amazon is updating Alexa to fix an issue that reportedly made it laugh at random. The company said the laugh was triggered when Alexa mistakenly heard \"Alexa, laugh,\" and is changing the command to \"Alexa, can you laugh?\" to make sure it doesn't happen anymore.  4. Microsoft has announced that Windows 10 S will no longer be a dedicated operating system. It will instead become a mode of the regular Windows 10 in 2019.  5. Google has updated its Duo video-messaging app with the ability to leave 30-second videos for users who miss or decline calls. The feature will roll out as part of an update for both iOS and Android users later this week.  6. Microsoft is launching a new AI platform for Windows 10 developers ahead of its annual Build developer conference. The platform, which includes the ability to import different learning models, will be available inside of Visual Studio.  7. Uber founder and ex-CEO Travis Kalanick is launching a venture fund focused on India and China.10100 will focus on \"large scale job creation,\" Kalanick said.  8. Magic Leap has raised $461 million (\u00a3332 million) from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The cash injection goes on top of its recent $502 million (\u00a3361 million) round in October, and brings the total Series D funding to $963 million (\u00a3693 million).  9. A consortium of 61 Japanese banks is planning to use Ripple's blockchain technology for a consumer payments app. The project will be starting with a trial in three banks in Autumn 2018.  10. Uber is reportedly seeking $1.25 billion (\u00a3900 million) for its second leveraged loan.

Amazon previously announced that the Alexa virtual assistant is coming to certain Windows 10 PCs, leaving the door open for more to come.  While the PC market is shrinking overall, Microsoft says that there are now over 600 million Windows 10 devices out in the wild.  Spotify is already available from the Windows Store, with Apple promising that a version of iTunes is on the way.  Amazon is bringing its popular Amazon Music streaming service to Windows 10. To cut to the chase: If you want it, you can get the app from the Windows Store here.  In a broader sense, it's part of a big play that Amazon is making for the Windows 10 PC.  In January, Amazon announced that its Alexa virtual assistant would be built in to some new PCs from manufacturers including HP, Acer, and Asus. While Amazon hasn't announced anything specifically, that news puts it within the realm of possibility that Amazon could release Alexa as a standalone Windows app, too. Besides, playing music is already a tremendously popular feature of the Alexa agent; having a full Amazon Music app too just makes sense.  On the one hand, the move to launch Amazon Music on Windows 10 seems counterintuitive. The PC market is shrinking, while Amazon's own hardware businesses \u2014 like the Alexa-powered Echo speakers and its Kindle Fire tablets\u2014 are booming, according to all available indicators.  And yet, Windows 10 is still a massive market. Microsoft says in a blog post that there are now over 600 million Windows 10 PCs out there. That gives Amazon a big market to address, which could help it gain ground on Spotify and Apple Music, the first- and second-place most popular streaming services, respectively. Notably, Spotify is already available on the Windows Store, with a delayed Apple iTunes app coming soon.  Plus, Microsoft is still a major player in the demographic that every media company wants: Young people. While Google's low-cost Chromebooks dominate the educational market in the United States, Windows is overall the most popular operating system in classrooms around the world.  In the bigger picture, too, Microsoft is reportedly pushing \"S Mode\"\u2014 a Windows 10 feature that grants improvements to battery life and performance, with the tradeoff that you can only install software from the Windows Store. If Microsoft's ambitions are fulfilled and \"S Mode\" comes to many more PCs, it'll behoove Amazon, Apple, and Spotify to all have apps on the Windows Store, or else risk losing access to those users.  As for Microsoft itself, it doesn't really have a horse in this race. The company shuttered its own Groove Music streaming service in 2017, offering users a way to migrate their playlists to Spotify. And Microsoft and Amazon had previously announced an integration between Alexa and the Microsoft Cortana smart agent, too."}, {"url": "http://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/microsoft-stock-price-slides-after-discrimination-harassment-complaints-go-public-2018-3-1018661559", "date": "2018-03-13T20:23:00Z", "host": "business-insider", "article": "Markets Insider  Shares of Microsoft fell 2.44% after news the company received 238 internal complaints about gender discrimination and sexual harassment.

Build is Microsoft's biggest developer event of the year.  Google is holding its I/O conference the same week \u2014 from May 8th to May 10th.  These events are booked weeks or months in advance so there's no way to tell who had it first.  Microsoft announced this week that Build, its biggest developer event of the year, will be held in Seattle from May 7th - May 9th.  The problem: Those dates go right up against the Google I/O conference, which will be held right near the Googleplex in Mountain View, California from May 8th to May 10th.  Both of these events are very big deals, especially for software developers.  Microsoft uses Build to preview what's next for its product lines, especially the Windows operating system and its Azure cloud computing platform. Highlights from last year's event included a new design sensibility for Windows 10 and news that Apple would bring iTunes to the Windows Store (which has yet to actually happen).  Google's is largely focused on the Android operating system. At last year's Google I/O, the search giant announced a new camera technology called Google Lens, and added more smarts to its Google Home speaker.  Unlike Microsoft, Google focuses its I/O conference on consumer tech \u2014 it holds a separate event called Google Cloud Next, for its cloud and enterprise businesses. This year, Google Cloud Next will be held in San Francisco in July.  Regardless, the two conferences are going to be competing both for attendees and mass market attention: There are a lot of developers with investments in both Microsoft and Google technologies.  Still, this clash of tech titans was probably unintentional. These events get booked months or even years in advance, and there's no way to tell that far out if you're going to have a conflict of this magnitude.  And it could always be worse. Microsoft held Build in San Francisco for many years, before moving it closer to its Washington State home in 2017. If Microsoft had stayed the course, the entire San Francisco Bay Area would have been overrun with developers and execs from two mega companies, not just one."}, {"url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/10-things-in-tech-you-need-to-know-today-january-30-2018-1", "date": "2018-01-30T07:54:44Z", "host": "business-insider", "article": "FCC Chairman Ajit Pai. YouTube Good morning! Here is the tech news you need to know this Tuesday.  1. Apple is reportedly working on at least three new Macs \u2014 two MacBooks and one desktop Mac \u2014 with processors designed in-house. The company may also release a redesigned iPad sometime later this year.  2. Cloud computing firm VMware is reportedly considering buying Dell. Dell currently owns 80% of VMWare, so the operation would be a reverse merger that could allow Dell to be traded publicly without going through a formal IPO.  3. The FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said he's opposed to proposals that would see the US government build a nationwide 5G network infrastructure. Earlier reports, later denied by the Trump administration, reported that members of the National Security Council asked the president to consider this proposal out of fear of \"losing out\" to China.  4. Microsoft Teams, the company's alternative to Slack, is getting its first huge update. The new version includes a slew of new features, like tighter integration with third-party apps, a revamped command box, slash commands, and a new store where you can search for apps by name or integration type.  5. Facebook will show more news from local sources in the news feed. It will identify local publishers by analyzing clicks in tight geographic areas.  6. Microsoft has bought PlayFab, a gaming service startup. The Redmond giant said that the acquisition will help it bolster its Azure platform in the ongoing competition against Google and Amazon.  7. Microsoft has released an update that prevents Windows 10 machines from randomly rebooting. The affected devices had received a Spectre/Meltdown software fix from Intel, but the patch was buggy and affected numerous users.  8. The UK government announced that it will fine companies in \"critical industries\" up to \u00a317 million ($24 million) if they don't put in place appropriate cybersecurity measures. The move comes as a response to a 2016 initiative named the NIS directive.  9. Immersion says it has settled its lawsuit and signed a license agreement with Apple. The two companies were at odds over patents on Apple-designed technologies such as 3D Touch, Force Touch, the Taptic Engine, and other haptic tech.  10. Google has completed its acquisition of HTC's smartphone division.
