In North Korea, where winter temperatures are frigid and which cannot produce enough cotton or wool for clothing, the synthetic fiber developed after nylon was glorified as a revolutionary invention.  Known outside North Korea as vinylon, it was christened\u201cvinalon\u201d by founder Kim Il Sung. He ordered it be developed to put clothes on people\u2019s backs.  It\u2019s a story which reveals much about the history of North Korea.  The state says the fiber symbolizes its self-reliance, but diplomatic records show the project was less successful than Kim hoped - Pyongyang was more dependent on others than it claimed.  The North Korean government does not provide foreign media with a point of contact in Pyongyang and the state\u2019s delegation to the United Nations did not respond to a request for comment.  See interactive story here: here  More in-depth stories about North Korea here: www.reuters.com/north-korea  WONDER FABRIC  The global vinylon fiber industry was worth $443 million in 2016 and is projected to reach $539 million by 2022, according to Orbis Research. Swedish outdoor clothing company Fj\u00e4llr\u00e4ven uses a form of vinylon, Vinylon F from Japan, in products including the K\u00e5nken backpack.  Fj\u00e4llr\u00e4ven does not source material from North Korea, a company spokesman said.  Companies in Japan and China make vinylon based on petroleum. But North Korea has no oil reserves. Instead it makes vinalon from two commodities it has in abundance: coal and limestone.  The process starts with workers mining anthracite and breaking limestones.  Vinalon dates back to 1939, two years after DuPont of the United States introduced nylon, and with it affordable stockings, American glamor and movie stars.  At the time, North Korea was part of Japan and nylon was undercutting Japanese silk and cotton exports. A Korean scientist was on the team that developed an alternative fiber. His name was Ri Sung Gi.  Ri\u2019s invention starts out as hard, white crystals that look like sea salt. But once drawn out and spun into a thread, it acquires a texture like cotton. It is stiff and hard to dye, but strong.  It was promising. But two wars interrupted Ri\u2019s efforts to develop his fabric.  In 1948, after World War Two, North Korea became a Communist state.  The North Koreans invaded the South and in the ensuing three years, the U.S. bombed Pyongyang. Around 2.5 million soldiers and civilians died on both sides, according to South Korea\u2019s defense ministry.  In 1953, the Korean War paused with a truce.  Ri wanted to help rebuild. He offered to develop his fabric in South Korea. The South, which was allied with the United States, was not interested.  At this time, all Soviet states were driving for technological prowess. The North was courting foreign scientists, and it did what it could to keep hold of them.  Ri defected. North Korea likened him to Marie Curie, the French chemist who developed the theory of radioactivity.  \u201cTo bore a hole into the heart of U.S. imperialism, I have been peering through microscopes and shaking my test tubes with determination,\u201d Ri Sung Gi wrote in his memoirs.  JUCHE!  The Soviet Union was forging ahead. On April 12, 1961 Russian Cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin beat America to be the first man in space. Josef Stalin sponsored Kim Il Sung as founder of North Korea.  Under Japanese rule, the North had received more investment in heavy industry than the South and it had ample energy.  But North Korea needed overcoats for its people, Kim told the Soviet ambassador, A.M. Puzanov.\u201cIf we do not solve the clothing problem it will be hard to compete with the South,\u201d he said, according to Puzanov\u2019s journal. The Soviet Union could not help supply cotton.  Ri had proven in lab tests that vinalon could be made. Kim saw the fiber as a political tool.  He created an ideology of self reliance known as Juche. The word translates literally as\u201csubject,\u201d but stands for the notion that man is the master of his own destiny.  Kim said vinalon was the\u201cjuche fiber.\u201d  \u201cThe vinalon industry is the shining fruition that the Juche idea of our Party was reflected in the field of chemical industry,\u201d Kim said in 1967.  On May 6 1961, he held an opening ceremony for the February 8 Vinalon Plant in Hamhung, in South Hamgyong province. Kim was telling his allies North Korea could produce 10,000 tonnes of vinalon a year and would soon be producing more than 300 million meters of textiles a year, according to documents in the Wilson Center archive.  The factory, built by a division of the Korean People\u2019s Army working on three shifts of 3,000 people, went up so quickly that the triumphal phrase\u201cvinalon speed\u201d emerged in state propaganda.  Looking at the first vinalon strands, Ri said they were\u201cwhite as snow and lighter than a dandelion puff.\u201d  Kim Sung-hee, a North Korean who defected to the South, said she attended the ribbon-cutting ceremony.  \u201cInside the factory I saw pink and red jackets. Even after 15 years, the vinalon jackets did not get frayed, although the colors could change a bit,\u201d she said.  Defectors born before the 1980s said they used to wear jackets, school uniforms and socks made of vinalon.  The fiber was part of an industrial drive like the one Mao Zedong launched in China. North Korea\u2019s effort was known as Chollima. Embodied by a Flying Horse, it galvanized workers into skipping breaks to boost productivity, helped by slogans such as\u201cdrink no soup.\u201d  In 1961 Kim Il Sung met his Chinese comrade Deng Xiaoping and told him North Korea had\u201calready succeeded\u201d in producing vinalon to ease the country\u2019s clothing problem. Deng said the process demanded electricity. But Kim was not worried.  \u201cWe won\u2019t need to use electricity in future. We can use oxygen,\u201d Kim said.  THE PEOPLE\u2019S ECONOMY  In the early 1960s, as an anti-Communist coup in South Korea and the Cuban missile crisis sent North Korea down a path of military buildup, the economy was growing fast.  An economist at Cambridge University in England, Joan Robinson, visited in 1964 and wrote that\u201call the economic miracles of the postwar world are put into the shade\u201d by what she saw, including vinalon. She recorded the formula for making it.  The North grew faster than the South - a trend which continued into the 1970s, according to U.N. and CIA economic data.  In 1972, the CIA recorded figures from 1956-1971 which showed the North had produced 7 million more meters of textiles than the South. In the early years the North\u2019s output of fish products, coal, iron ore, steel, cement, chemical fertilisers and tractors also exceeded that of the South.  The CIA figures show that until the mid 1960s, the North consistently exported more than the South in dollar terms.

KCNA did not state when the picture was taken. The Korean characters read: \"Improvement of people's lives\". REUTERS/KCNA/File Photo  KING OF FIBERS  North Koreans called vinalon\u201cthe King of Fibers\u201d and featured it in cartoons to teach children how independent and successful the country was.  A TV show from 1976 shows Vinalon Man win a race against Mr Nylon.  But in reality, the fabric\u2019s limits were emerging. It was not good at keeping people warm. And power was becoming a problem. By now, oil was cheap in the West and the outside world was using it in abundance for energy, transportation and synthetic materials.  North Korea had no oil reserves for making vinalon or powering its factories and Pyongyang depended on oil imports from the Soviet Union. Even so, Kim Il Sung said North Korea must be independent.  \u201cIt may be cheaper and faster to produce the synthetic fiber using petro-chemistry ... But, constructing industries dependent on other countries\u2019 raw materials is the same as having others grab you by the collar,\u201d he said.  To help make its fabric of stone, the North wanted nuclear power. For years, it asked its Soviet allies to help with generation facilities. It only secured one nuclear power station. In 1967, vinalon inventor Ri was made head of the Atomic Energy Research Institute in Yongbyon. Today, this houses the North\u2019s light water nuclear reactor.  In 1973, Kim Dong Gyu, a high-ranking North Korean official, told Romania\u2019s leader Nicolai Ceaucescu that North Korea was producing\u201c70-80 tons\u201d of vinalon, and finding that hard to increase.  \u201cPresently we are struggling to increase production in vinalon factories up to 50,000 tons per year,\u201d he said.  The Hamhung facility was expanded so it could make more calcium carbide, the coal and limestone compound on which vinalon is based. Soviet economies were driven by targets laid down in plans rather than the laws of supply and demand.  Calcium carbide can be used to make many things. Defectors from Hamhung told Reuters that it was thought to make chemical weapons - a claim others have also made and which is technically possible, but which no one has proven.  \u201cEvery factory in North Korea, whatever factory that would be ... had divisions for the Second Economy,\u201d said Lee Min-bok, 60, who worked as a researcher at the Academy of Agricultural Science and visited the first vinalon factory.  \u201cPeople in North Korea call the war industry the Second Economy. The first economy is called the People\u2019s Economy.\u201d  More recently, Western arms experts at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies suggested the vinalon plant might be used to help produce rocket fuel for missile tests. Scientists say this too is technically possible, but unproven.  As North Korea built up its military, its debts increased. It eventually owed a total of $11 billion to Moscow, most of which Russia was to write off in 2012. The North also accumulated debts in the West. They went unpaid year after year, totaling around $770 million in the 1970s.  Soviet support was declining, and China\u2019s new leader Deng Xiaoping was introducing market principles. He signed agreements on trade with North Korea in 1982.  Slideshow (6 Images)  North Korea started building a second vinalon factory in Sunchon in 1983, to achieve\u201ca target 1.5 billion meters of cloth.\u201d  The factory was to be the biggest chemical industrial complex in the country and be controlled by the military. Kim\u2019s talk of running it on oxygen never materialized. Despite the reported $10 billion investment, the complex was never fully completed.  When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, North Korea lost all its Soviet funding. Chinese imports entered ordinary North Koreans\u2019 lives. China has exported hundreds of thousands of tons of textiles and clothing to North Korea, customs data show.  \u201cIn the 1990s, North Koreans relied mostly on Chinese fabric for their clothes. Since then, enormous amounts of Chinese fabric have been imported into North Korea,\u201d said Choi Goog-jin, a South Korean entrepreneur who tried to import North Korean vinalon in 2011.  CAPITALISM AT NIGHT  On July 8, 1994, Kim Il Sung died from a heart attack. His son Kim Jong Il took over, but within a year, Pyongyang was forced to ask international humanitarian agencies for aid.  Hamhung was hit by a flood and received no coal. It suspended fiber production.  There was no work. Residents from Hamhung said vinalon became the basis of an exchange scheme to survive. It was a similar story across the country.  Famine killed as many as 3 million North Koreans. North Koreans still call those years the\u201cArduous March,\u201d a term introduced by the official media to stir the starving.  Defectors say people took machine parts, as well as pure nickel and copper from wires and pipes, to informal markets.  \u201cPeople ripped machines into metal parts from the vinalon factory, smuggled and sold them ... some of them were publicly executed. ... Production lines stopped rolling ... workers starved to death,\u201d said Jeong Jin-hwa, 53, who defected to the South in 1999.  By 1996, when vinalon\u2019s inventor Ri Sung Gi died, even party cadres loyal to the socialist system had turned to trading - a form of capitalist\u201cself-reliance.\u201d  In 2001, Choi Goog-jin, the South Korean entrepreneur, created a company, Korea Vinylon Co Ltd, to import North Korean vinalon. After one year of sample tests and negotiations, the business failed.  \u201cVinalon doesn\u2019t have competitiveness in clothing,\u201d said Choi.\u201cIf you look at vinalon suits in North Korea, they are rough and heavy.\u201d  In 2002, in Onsong County, North Korea, a high school student also called Choi said he bought a fake Adidas t-shirt and short pants from a market. The blue clothes were made of vinalon.  \u201cI wore that fake Adidas kit until I came here,\u201d said Choi, now 30, who defected to the South in 2006.\u201cThe color did not change. It was quite sturdy.\u201d  \u201cWe have this expression - socialism during the day and capitalism at night,\u201d Choi said.\u201cThat is, politically and what is seen on surface is socialism but beneath the surface, everything people do is capitalistic.\u201d  VINALON\u201cVICTORY\u201d  In 2010, Kim Jong Il reopened the February 8 Vinalon Complex.  \u201cThis is an extra-big event, as important as launching a new type A-bomb, and represents a great victory of socialism,\u201d he said.  The next year, he died suddenly on his private train. His son, Kim Jong Un, took over and in 2012 introduced economic changes, including turning a blind eye to the informal markets.  There was demand for vinalon - in those private markets.  Jung Min-woo, 29, served as a military officer before leaving North Korea in 2013. He said some ranking military officers bought custom-made shiny vinalon uniforms from private markets to look cool.  \u201cMany ranking officers wear them... but they are not good for a war,\u201d he said.  \u201cIf war breaks out lots of sparks and bullets go back and forth... Cotton tends to melt and vanish but vinalon burns you because it sticks to your skin,\u201d Jung said.  Entrepreneur Choi agreed.\u201cThe uniforms made of vinalon are not suitable for combat,\u201d he said.\u201cWhen it rains, the uniforms soak up water and become very heavy, which inevitably makes it difficult for soldiers to move. After a while, the uniforms turn very stiff.\u201d  By now, instead of producing vinalon, many North Koreans made clothes for China. Kang Eung Chan, who defected in 2013, said he hired 40 local seamstresses and used imported fabrics - including nylon - to make jumpers for Chinese customers. He paid locals $40-50 a month.  \u201cWho wears vinalon now? Almost no one,\u201d said Kang.  Even so, North Korea says it still produces the fiber. In his 2017 New Year\u2019s speech, Kim Jong Un laid out a plan to revamp the vinalon complex.  \u201cThis sector should revitalize production at the February 8 Vinalon Complex, expand the capacity of other major chemical factories and transform their technical processes in our own way,\u201d he said.  If the new leader manages to drive North Korea\u2019s vinalon output with as much vigor as its missile tests, the fabric made of stone may yet find a new lease of life.", "date": "2018-01-17T18:22:33Z", "host": "reuters"}], "AAPL": [{"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-agrees-deal-with-ireland-over-15-billion-unpaid-tax-issue-1512392552", "article": "BRUSSELS\u2014Ireland will begin collecting \u20ac13 billion ($15.46 billion) in back taxes from Apple Inc. as soon as early next year after both sides agreed to the terms of an escrow fund for the money, Ireland\u2019s finance chief said Monday.

Photo: Kiichiro Sato/Associated Press  Apple Inc., AAPL 0.69% facing questions from users and tech analysts about reduced performance in older iPhones, acknowledged Wednesday that its latest software curtails the computing power of some models to prevent unexpected shutdowns.  It was a rare statement from the company that shed light on how Apple internally dealt with a growing user complaint.  The statement came two days after John Poole, founder of the computer-performance testing group Geekbench, wrote a blog post illustrating how iPhone computing performance slows as battery health declines on iPhone 6s and iPhone 7 devices.  Apple said that as iPhone batteries age, or in certain conditions such as cold weather or at low charge, they can struggle to respond to a phone\u2019s power demands. This can cause the device to unexpectedly shut down to protect \u201cits electronic components,\u201d the company said.  Earlier Got an iPhone 6 or 6s with a draining battery? WSJ's Joanna Stern tells you easy and hard ways to fix the problem now\u2014so you can hold out for the new iPhone models due this fall.  To prevent iPhone 6, iPhone 6s and SE devices from powering off\u2014something that drew complaints last year from Chinese consumer-protection groups\u2014Apple said it tweaked its iPhone operating system, iOS, to slow certain tasks that required more computing power than the device could provide.  Evidence of the software change could be seen in power-intensive tasks\u2014such as creating Snapchat filters\u2014that became slower in order to demand less of the system.  \u201cOur goal is to deliver the best experience for customers, which includes overall performance and prolonging the life of their devices,\u201d Apple wrote, adding that it recently extended the feature to iPhone 7 devices with its iOS 11.2 software update.  Battery life and processing speed are two of the most important features for smartphone users, according to a survey of smartphone buyers by investment bank UBS. Owners of iPhones have complained for years that their batteries worsen after they update to a new iOS. Apple has said that battery life may initially decrease after an update as an iPhone rebuilds indexes and caches, but that battery health returns to previous levels within days.  Apple\u2019s newest software, iOS 11, has been troubled by a number of bugs, including one that turned the letter \u201cI\u201d into a question mark and another that crashed some iPhones when third-party apps sent notifications. The company has issued eight updates since September, two more than it issued through the same period last year for iOS 10.  Mr. Poole said many customers, after updating to iOS 11, believe their iPhone is slower because it is old and needs to be replaced, but he said they would be better off replacing the battery.  \u201cWe see that once users put a new battery in their phone, battery life and performance goes back up to where they should be,\u201d Mr. Poole said.  The issues have stoked frustration among some iPhone users. Susan Nappa, who uses her iPhone 7 Plus to run her Greenwich, Conn.-based fashion and accessories company, said the device\u2019s internet browser is running slower since she upgraded to iOS 11.  \u201cWe\u2019re not giving these devices up, but it\u2019s so frustrating,\u201d said Ms. Nappa, who has been using iPhones for nearly a decade.

Analyst Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein cut both his second-quarter and full-year forecasts for iPhones but said he did not expect Apple\u2019s 2018 profit to fall steeply because of changes to U.S. tax law that will bring the company\u2019s rate down to 18 percent.  \u201cApple earnings should handily beat December quarter expectations, but March guidance could moderately disappoint,\u201d UBS analysts said.  The production cut was prompted by slower-than-expected sales in the holiday shopping season in Europe, the United States and China, the Japanese newspaper reported, without citing a source. (s.nikkei.com/2BASQZU)  The iPhone X was the first phone to sport a new design since the launch of the iPhone 6 in 2015 and many expected it to lead to blockbuster sales, dubbed by Wall Street analysts as a\u201csupercycle.\u201d  \u201cThis was supposed to be the supercycle year and if Apple hasn\u2019t been able to drive substantial unit growth this year, then that makes you a little cautious on future iPhone cycles,\u201d Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell said.  FILE PHOTO: The new iPhone X is pictured at the Apple Store Marche Saint-Germain in Paris, France, November 3, 2017. REUTERS/Benoit Tessier/File Photo  Several analysts have lowered their estimates for iPhone X shipments in the past few weeks, citing the high price of the device and other factors, with at least three downgrading their rating on the stock.  Sacconaghi of Bernstein had originally predicted that Apple would outpace Wall Street expectations of 62 million iPhones by selling 66 million units, but on Monday he cut that figure to 53 million units, a nearly 20-percent cut. He also cut his full year iPhone unit forecast 11 percent to 220 million units.  But he only slightly revised his full-year earnings per share estimate for 2018 to $11.80 from $11.87, citing the positive effects of U.S. tax law changes.  Adding to the concerns, Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) said last week its postpaid device activations were lower than last year as people were keeping phones longer.  A survey of people planning to buy the iPhone showed that the percentage of them looking to buy the iPhone X has dropped to 37 percent from 43 percent in an earlier survey, UBS analysts wrote in a note on Monday.  The iPhone X, which features an edge-to-edge display and facial recognition technology to unlock the phone, went on sale in November in the United States.  Asian supply chain checks suggest that iPhone X orders have been weakening recently, with first-quarter production likely to be about 20 million units, JP Morgan analysts wrote in a note dated Jan. 24.  A few of Apple\u2019s iPhone parts suppliers are based in Asia. Shares of Foxconn, one of Apple\u2019s main suppliers and formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (2317.TW), fell 0.7 percent on Monday.

Moeller-Maersk A/S and pharmaceutical firm Merck & Co.  Ukraine, which bore the brunt of the attack, accused Russia at the time of orchestrating the attack. Wednesday\u2019s allegations by London represented the first time a major Western government has pinned blame on Moscow for the incident.  The findings add to a litany of complaints by the West accusing Russia of cyber meddling, including U.S. allegations that Moscow influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election. U.K. lawmakers also have raised questions about whether Russia tried to influence a 2016 referendum in which Britain voted to exit from the European Union. Russia has denied meddling in the U.S. and U.K. elections.  U.K. intelligence officials said late Wednesday that they concluded that Russia\u2019s military was \u201calmost certainly responsible\u201d for the attack, according to a statement by Britain\u2019s foreign office. It said it decided to publicly point the finger to show that the U.K. and its allies \u201cwill not tolerate malicious cyber activity.\u201d  The U.K. didn\u2019t provide specific evidence for its conclusion that Russia was to blame. The Russian embassy in Washington didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment late Wednesday.  Related Breaches Can Stir Interest in ETFs  The Petya computer \u201cworm,\u201d or malicious software, also known as NotPeyta, spread among corporate computer networks running Microsoft Corp.\u2019s Windows systems. Similar to last May\u2019s \u201cWannaCry\u201d worm, it locked computer files and demanded about $300 in digital currency from the unidentified attackers to unlock them.  Security experts said the worm appeared to stem from Ukrainian tax software.  Besides FedEx, Maersk and Merck, victims included French construction giant Saint-Gobain, British advertising firm WPP Group PLC and consumer-goods giants Mondelez International Inc. and Reckitt Benckiser Group PLC. FedEx said in September that the attack dented quarterly earnings by about $300 million, after Petya disrupted operations at Dutch subsidiary TNT Express.  Britain\u2019s foreign office said the attack targeted Ukrainian financial, energy and government sectors, but that its \u201cindiscriminate design\u201d caused it to spread to other European and Russian businesses. British officials said the attack caused hundreds of millions of dollars of losses throughout Europe.  Britain has blamed Russia for meddling across U.K. media, telecommunications and energy sectors. The head of its National Cyber Security Centre, an arm of an intelligence agency, said in November that \u201cRussia is seeking to undermine the international system.\u201d In addition to British lawmakers calling for the government investigation into Moscow\u2019s possible influence in the Brexit referendum, Facebook Inc. said last month that it would examine whether Russia attempted to use the social network to affect that vote.  In the U.S., top intelligence officials said Tuesday that the November midterm elections were vulnerable to the Russian interference that plagued the 2016 presidential race, especially through cyber means. The Justice Department had identified members of the Russian government involved in hacking the Democratic National Committee\u2019s computers and swiping sensitive information that became public during the 2016 campaign.  In December, the U.S. and U.K. blamed North Korea for the \u201cWannaCry\u201d cyberattack that affected England\u2019s National Health Service and other large institutions. Britain\u2019s foreign office said North Korea was trying to circumvent economic sanctions. North Korea has denied a role in the attack.
