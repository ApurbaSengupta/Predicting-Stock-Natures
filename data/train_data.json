Apple is looking to reassert dominance in U.S. schools, where inexpensive laptops running software from Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google and Microsoft Corp now top iPad by sales, offering a cheap way to get to cloud-based productivity tools.  The new iPad has a more powerful computing chip and an extensive set of new, free software for teachers to manage students and schoolwork. But the unchanged starting price of $299 for students and $329 for the general public, without a keyboard or case, compares with less than $200 for some Windows and Google Chrome models.  Apple shares were down 1.4 percent to $170.26 after the event, slightly better than the NASDAQ Composite, which was down 1.6 percent in midday trading.  Some analysts had believed Apple might cut prices, but the company stuck with its more traditional approach of packing more features into a device.  Despite the new software, Apple faces a tough battle in the educational market given the popularity of Google and Microsoft\u2019s productivity suites, said Carolina Milanesi of Creative Strategies. Google\u2019s G Suite fueled Chromebook sales because it was seen as easy to use to manage assignments.  \u201cMost teachers don\u2019t look past G Suite for education,\u201d she said.  Apple, as part of its response, on Tuesday announced improvements in its iWork suite at an event in Chicago, where school bells and announcements over a public address system directed press and more than 300 teachers into an auditorium at Lane Tech College Prep High School.  The event came during a spring buying season when many schools are making purchasing decisions for the upcoming school year.  \u201cWe\u2019ve been at this for 40 years and we care deeply about education,\u201d Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said at the event.  Apple executives said the new iPad works with its pencil accessory and features an upgraded A10 Fusion chip, the same CPU that powers the iPhone 7. It is available immediately.  The Apple Pencil remains priced at $99 for the public and $89 for schools, though Lenovo will release a device called Crayon for $49, the first third-party stylus to work with the iPad.  Apple's Vice-President of iOS, iPad and iPhone Product Marketing, Greg Joswiak, speaks at an education-focused event at Lane Technical College Prep High School in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., March 27, 2018. REUTERS/John Gress  Apple made up just 17 percent of the K-12 U.S. educational market in the third quarter, according to data from Futuresource Consulting. Meanwhile 60 percent of mobile computing shipments to schools ran Google\u2019s Chrome and 22 percent had Windows.  Chromebooks sold by Dell Technologies Inc cost as little as $189. Microsoft last year introduced an education-focused laptop from Lenovo Group Ltd running Windows 10 S for a similar price.  Acer Inc announced a tablet that runs Chrome OS for $329 on Monday that comes with a built-in stylus.  Apple in recent years made changes to its operating system so that more than one student can log into an iPad, and to its software to let teachers better manage students.  On Tuesday it updated iWork - which includes word processing, spreadsheet and presentation software - to allow students to take handwritten notes more easily, along with adding more free storage on its iCloud service.  Apple also released a new app called Schoolwork to help teachers create assignments and track student progress. Google has a similar app for managing student profiles, but analysts highlighted Apple\u2019s Schoolwork app as unique in helping teachers manage assignments and progress.  The previously iPad-focused Classroom teacher administration app would start working on Mac computers in June, Apple said.  In the fall Apple will roll out \u201cEveryone Can Create\u201d lessons on video, photography, music, and drawing, joining existing \u201cEveryone Can Code\u201d guides for computer programming skills.  The new courses highlight features that some low-priced laptops do not have, such as a camera and microphone.  \u201cIf you look at it as a Chromebook competitor, it\u2019s expensive. But if you look at it and say, I can do music with GarageBand, I can take pictures or use it as a video camera and now I can do (augmented reality) ... it appeals to teachers and schools that want to push the envelope on education,\u201d Milanesi said.

REUTERS/Regis Duvignau/File Photo  At an annual shareholder meeting at Apple Park in Cupertino on Tuesday, Cook responded to a question on whether the company might double its dividend in the wake of changes to United States tax laws that allowed corporations to bring back overseas cash at lower tax rates than before.  \u201cSpecial dividends, I\u2019m not really a fan of,\u201d Cook responded. \u201cBut in terms of annual increases in the dividend, it is something that this board and management are committed to doing.\u201d  Cook said the company would provide an update on its capital return program during its April earnings call with investors, as it has done for the past several years.  At the meeting, shareholders defeated two shareholder proposals, one asking that rules allowing shareholders to nominate directors to the board be eased, and another asking for a human rights committee at Apple.  The proxy access measure asked Apple to reconsider its rules for shareholders to nominate directors; the rules say that a group of no more than 20 shareholders must hold 3 percent of Apple\u2019s stock in order to nominate a director for one of the eight director positions. The proposal did not pass, with 67.8 percent of shareholders voting against it.  Another proposal urged Apple to create a human rights panel to oversee issues such as workplace conditions and censorship in China and to report results back to the public. The proposal was defeated, with 94.4 percent of shareholders voting against it.  Apple had recommended that shareholders vote against both of the measures.  Shareholders approved four measures put forth by the company, including a required \u201csay on pay\u201d vote to approve pay for executives and a measure on re-electing the current directors.

REUTERS/Charles Platiau  Wall Street\u2019s optimism about last year\u2019s 10th anniversary iPhone had propelled Apple\u2019s stock 24 percent higher over the past 12 months, giving it a market capitalization of $893 billion.  That is $141 billion more than the $752 billion market value of Amazon, the world\u2019s third most valuable publicly listed company, but Amazon has been quickly closing the gap.  (For graphic on Market Capitalization: Apple vs Amazon.com vs Alphabet, click: reut.rs/2Fn9hzA)  Amazon\u2019s stock has surged 83 percent over the past year, bolstered by scorchingly fast revenue growth as more shopping moves online and businesses shift their computing operations to the cloud, where Amazon Web Services leads the market.  In January, Amazon announced that it, Berkshire Hathaway Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co would form a company to cut health care costs for their employees, which was widely seen as a threat to the existing U.S. healthcare system and underscored Amazon\u2019s ability to disrupt markets.  Amazon dislodged Microsoft Corp as the No. 3 U.S. company by market capitalization in February.  At $783 billion, Alphabet Inc has the second largest market capitalization. The Google parent company\u2019s stock has grown about 33 percent over the past year, faster than Apple but far slower than Amazon.  Meanwhile, optimism about Apple\u2019s iPhone X has given way to concerns that demand for the $1,000 device may be weaker than expected.  To be sure, past stock gains are not a reliable predictor of future performance, and the surge in Amazon shares in recent years has been exceptional by most standards.  But if Amazon\u2019s stock were to keep growing on the trajectory seen over the past year, the company\u2019s market capitalization would hit $1 trillion in late August. Apple would reach $1 trillion around a week later if its stock price continued to rise at the same pace seen over the past year.  Alphabet would not reach $1 trillion until 2019 if its stock price continued to rise at the same pace seen over the past year.

Investors seeking to gauge demand for the iPhone last quarter got clues Wednesday from Qualcomm Inc. and Broadcom Ltd., two of Apple Inc.\u2019s biggest suppliers.  Both companies indicated that orders related to the iPhone tailed off more than normal at this time of year. That helped round out a flurry of reports in recent weeks that suggested demand for the flagship handset hasn\u2019t met rosy predictions, dragging on Apple\u2019s shares.  Qualcomm said that orders from a large customer tailed off at worse-than-typical levels in the quarter. San Diego-based Qualcomm didn\u2019t identify the company, but the remarks were widely interpreted as referring to Apple. Broadcom said it expects a \u201cgreater-than-seasonal decline in wireless\u201d components, indicating fewer-than-anticipated sales of its chips for its fiscal second quarter, which ends in April. Broadcom provides wireless network and Bluetooth components for the iPhone. Christopher Rolland, an analyst at Susquehanna Investment Group, pegged Apple as the reason for the order slowdown in a note Wednesday.  Apple reports earnings after the close of trading. Analysts have projected revenue of $84 billion to $87 billion for the holiday quarter, including from its new flagship iPhone X, which went on sale in November. However, supply chain reports have indicated that the Cupertino, California-based technology giant has cut iPhone X orders in half for early 2018. Multiple analysts also have said the iPhone X was not the holiday smash hit that some expected.  The company\u2019s stock gained 48 cents to $167.91 as of 1:30 p.m. in New York. Through Wednesday, it had declined 6.6 percent since reaching a record Jan. 18 as talk of an iPhone slump set in. BMO Capital Markets downgraded its rating on the stock Wednesday. Ming-Chi Kuo, at KGI Securities, recently warned that iPhone X sales weren\u2019t as strong as anticipated in China. JPMorgan wrote that \"demand has gone sour quickly,\" and a survey by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners found iPhone X models made up just a fifth of iPhone sales in the holiday quarter.  A smaller supplier, Qorvo Inc., predicted current quarter sales of as little as $645 million, missing analysts\u2019 estimates by more than $100 million.

The Cupertino, California-based company said revenue in the three months ending in March will be $60 billion to $62 billion. Analysts were looking for $65.9 billion on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  For the final quarter of 2017, Apple said it sold 77.3 million iPhones, down 1 percent from a year earlier and below analysts\u2019 projections of 80.2 million units. The average selling price was $796 -- ahead of expectations -- suggesting its flagship iPhone X handset sold relatively well, while cheaper versions weren\u2019t as popular.  The numbers, which would be extraordinary for virtually any other company in the world, underscore the elevated expectations that investors have for Apple. They also highlight concern about lackluster demand for iPhones, sparked by recent reports of Apple cutting orders to suppliers and lower analyst estimates. Fewer new handsets means Apple has to work harder to sell related services, accessories and other devices. It also leaves less time for the company to create its next big hit, potentially in wearable technology, augmented reality or even transportation.  Apple reported fiscal first-quarter revenue of $88.3 billion, and profit of $3.89 a share, beating average analyst estimates.  Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said the 2017 holiday period was a week shorter, compared with 2016, limiting iPhone sales. \"We are very, very happy with the guidance we are providing,\" he added, noting that sales of handsets were strong in all regions.  \"IPhone X was the most popular phone and since we launched it in early November, for every week it\u2019s been the top selling iPhone,\" Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said in an interview. \"Couldn\u2019t be prouder of it.\"  Apple shares fell about 1 percent in extended trading, after closing at $167.78 in New York on Thursday. The stock had dropped about six percent in the days leading up to earnings.  The iPhone X, which went on sale in November, is available in $999 and $1,149 configurations, at least $150 more than any iPhone starting price that came before. The new iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus handsets also start at $50 more than their predecessors. Those higher sticker prices buoyed ASPs and helped revenue in the holiday period.

The U.S. government has requested information from the company, according to the people, who asked not to be named because the probe is private.  The inquiry is in early stages, they cautioned, and it\u2019s too soon to conclude any enforcement will follow. Investigators are looking into public statements made by Apple on the situation, they added. While the slowdown has frustrated consumers, investigators are concerned the company may have misled investors about the performance of older phones.  \"We have received questions from some government agencies and we are responding to them,\" an Apple spokeswoman said. She reiterated an earlier statement that the company \"never \u2014 and would never \u2014 do anything to intentionally shorten the life of any Apple product, or degrade the user experience to drive customer upgrades.\"  A spokesman for the SEC declined to comment.

Photographer: Michael Nagle/Bloomberg  Several weeks ago, Apple said a software update released in early 2017 slowed down the performance of older iPhones models as a way to avoid the phones shutting down at random. When it released the update, the company hadn\u2019t said the software would slow down the devices. In December, Apple apologized for not clearly communicating this information and vowed to release another update to mitigate the concern.  Earlier in January, Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook told ABC News that when the company put out the software update that caused the performance issues for older iPhones \u201cwe did say what it was, but I don\u2019t think a lot of people were paying attention. And maybe we should have been clearer.\u201d  The slowdowns occur when an older iPhone\u2019s battery reaches a certain, unspecified point of low health and can be fixed if a user replaces the battery. As part of its public apology, Apple cut the prices of battery replacements in its stores to $29, a $50 discount.  Apple plans to release an iPhone software update, called iOS 11.3, in the next few months with new features that let users monitor the health of their batteries and protect against slowdowns. If consumers turn off the throttling, older iPhones will be more prone to randomly rebooting, Apple has said. The system affects iPhone 7 models and older, but not the iPhone 8 and iPhone X, according to the company.  John Thune Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg  After apologizing to customers in December, Apple was sued by consumer advocacy groups and individual iPhone users in a global backlash. Government officials, including U.S. Senator John Thune, a Republican from South Dakota, have also questioned Apple about the slowdowns.  \u201cEven if Apple\u2019s actions were indeed only intended to avoid unexpected shutdowns in older phones, the large volume of consumer criticism leveled against the company in light of its admission suggests that there should have been better transparency with respect to these practices,\u201d Thune wrote in a January letter to Cook.

Apple will be told to file the transaction to the Brussels-based antitrust authority, who will take over the merger review from Austria, where it was originally declared.  Big technology mergers involving startups with insignificant revenue usually fall through the EU\u2019s usual net for checking whether deals harm competition across the bloc. However, alarmed that it nearly missed Facebook Inc.\u2019s takeover of messaging service WhatsApp, the EU is seeking to change its rules to allow it to take charge of acquisitions where a target company makes no money but holds valuable technology or intellectual property.  Apple announced its purchase of the U.K.-based app in December, for a reported $400 million, according to people familiar with the transaction, which would make it one of Apple\u2019s largest acquisitions. The Shazam app uses the microphone on a smartphone or computer to identify almost any song playing nearby, then points users to places they can listen to it, such as Apple Music or Spotify Ltd.  The acquisition would help Apple embed that capability more deeply into its music offerings. The company\u2019s digital assistant Siri was integrated with Shazam in 2014, so users could ask it what song is playing in the background.  The EU may be worried that once Shazam is under Apple\u2019s control, the iPhone maker could choose to make Apple Music the only option for listening to tracks. That could divert some of the referrals from Shazam that currently go to London-based Spotify. The acquisition also gives Apple access to a large user data base of people\u2019s musical interests.  Apple hasn\u2019t indicated that it plans to make Shazam an exclusive for Apple Music, but in the past the company has sometimes made acquired features compatible only with its products. It also has sometimes kept support for properties it\u2019s bought, for example, when Cupertino, California-based Apple acquired Beats Music to develop Apple Music, Apple released an Android version of the program.  Apple said it would work with the EU on the matter, but declined to provide further detail. The EU took up the review after Austria, Iceland, Italy, France, Norway, Spain and Sweden all asked it to do so.  The EU reviewed and approved the Facebook-WhatsApp deal after several European authorities asked the commission to step in. Facebook was later fined for misleading the EU during the merger probe.

Apple also told employees Wednesday that it\u2019s issuing stock-based bonuses worth $2,500 each following the new U.S. tax law, according to people familiar with the matter.  In its December approval of the most extensive tax-code revisions since 1986, Congress scrapped the previous international tax system for corporations -- an unusual arrangement that allowed companies to defer U.S. income taxes on foreign earnings until they returned the income to the U.S. That \u201cdeferral\u201d provision led companies to stockpile an estimated $3.1 trillion offshore and many were criticized for the moves, including Apple.  By switching to a new system that\u2019s designed to focus on domestic economic activity, congressional tax writers also imposed a two-tiered levy on that accumulated foreign income: Cash will be taxed at 15.5 percent, less liquid assets at 8 percent. Companies can pay over eight years.  New Jobs  Apple is the first major U.S. technology company to act on the new tax law and it joins others, such as Intel Corp., in responding to criticism by President Donald Trump and others that corporations have been ignoring American workers and manufacturing. Job creation was a key pillar of Trump\u2019s election campaign. That means the new positions created by Apple are likely to have a more significant political impact than its $38 billion tax payment, according to Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business.  \u201cThe thrust here is American jobs, jobs on American soil, build manufacturing here, don\u2019t build everything in China,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cYou can\u2019t have an announcement of a million jobs. But you can have companies like Apple saying that we\u2019re going to have 20,000 new jobs here. If other companies say they\u2019re going to have new jobs too, it does add up.\u201d  For more on Apple, check out the Decrypted podcast:  Later Wednesday, Trump tweeted a response lauding Apple\u2019s announcement. \u201cI promised that my policies would allow companies like Apple to bring massive amounts of money back to the United States,\u201d he wrote. \u201cGreat to see Apple follow through as a result of TAX CUTS. Huge win for American workers and the USA!\u201d  Apple has the largest offshore cash reserves of any U.S. company, with about $252 billion at the end of September, the most recently reported fiscal quarter. The tax rate indicates that Apple is likely bringing back a majority of its overseas cash back to the U.S., leaving only a small portion for international investments like retail stores.  \u201cThey\u2019re going to have well over $200 billion by the end of this year that will be available for incremental investments, capital returns and M&A,\u201d said Matthew Kanterman, a New York-based Bloomberg Intelligence analyst. The new tax law lets U.S. companies bring overseas cash reserves back home in one year and pay the resulting tax bill over eight years. \u201cAnd Apple hasn\u2019t historically done big M&A,\u201d he said.  Five-Year Spending Plan  The $30 billion in capital expenditures will come as part of $350 billion that Apple expects to spend in the U.S. over the next five years. The 20,000 new jobs include additional Apple employees at its campuses, data centers, and retail stores, but not third-party developers for iPhone and Mac apps, an economy Apple has touted in the past.  Apple said that part of the $30 billion in capital expenditures will go toward a new U.S.-based campus, new data centers and additional supplier investments. The company, which opened a new headquarters in Cupertino last year, said its new U.S. site initially will be focused on employees who provide technical support to Apple product users. The new location, which Apple said it will announce later this year, will be similar to the company\u2019s existing campus in Austin, Texas, for supply-chain and technical-support employees.  Can This Tax Proposal Lure Companies and Cash Home?: QuickTake  Apple said it will increase its local manufacturing fund, announced last year, from $1 billion to $5 billion, indicating that it will be sourcing more components for its products domestically. As part of the original fund, Apple invested in Corning Inc. and Finisar Corp., companies that make components for iPhone glass screens and lasers for Face ID and AirPods, respectively.  \u201cThese are probably many capital expenditure initiatives and new site build-outs that Apple was already planning on doing regardless of repatriation,\u201d said Michael Olson, an analyst at Piper Jaffray, who has the equivalent of a buy rating on the stock.  \u201cWhat\u2019s not said in this release is that there is more potential for increased buybacks for shareholders and acquisitions that might not have taken place if it were not for the cash influx from overseas,\u201d Olson said.

Like with its mobile devices -- the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch -- Apple intends to frequently update the AirPods with new hardware features. The Cupertino, California-based technology giant is working on a new version for release as soon as this year with an upgraded wireless chip, the people said. A subsequent model for as early as next year is planned to be water resistant, they added, asking not to be identified discussing private product plans.  Apple Inc. AirPod wireless headphones. Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg  The model coming as early as this year will let people summon Apple\u2019s Siri digital assistant without physically tapping the headphones by saying \"Hey Siri.\" The function will work similarly to how a user activates Siri on an iPhone or a HomePod speaker hands-free. The headphones, internally known as B288, will include an upgraded Apple-designed wireless chip for managing Bluetooth connections. The first AirPods include a chip known as the W1, and Apple released the W2 with the Apple Watch last year.  The idea for the water-resistant model is for the headphones to survive splashes of water and rain, the people said. They likely won\u2019t be designed to be submerged in water. The latest iPhones can survive splashes, while the Apple Watch is considered \"swim-proof.\" Apple\u2019s plans could change or be delayed, the people said. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.  Apple's Other Sales Boom Other Products category is Apple's fastest growing division thanks to devices like AirPods  The AirPods are designed by the same department that produced the HomePod speaker, Bloomberg News reported last year. Apple introduced the first AirPods in 2016 alongside the iPhone 7 as a way to replace the traditional wired headphone jack. Since launch, AirPods have been considered one of the top-performing Apple products and have resonated with both reviewers and consumers.  Apple\u2019s W1 chip in Airpods. Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg  The product helped take wireless headphones mainstream. It was one of the first models to be fully wireless and come in a case that charges the headset. Similar products followed from Google, Sony Corp., Samsung Electronics Co., Motorola and Bose. AirPods accounted for 85 percent of the money spent in the U.S. on wireless headphones since they debuted, research firm NPD Group estimated last year.  Apple\u2019s Other Products segment, which includes AirPods, Beats headphones, the Watch, Apple TV and accessories, generated more than $5 billion in revenue for the first time in the company\u2019s fiscal first quarter, representing 36 percent year-over-year growth.  \"Wearables were the second-largest contributor to revenue growth after iPhone, which is impressive,\" Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said during a conference call with analysts earlier this month, adding that sales jumped almost 70 percent last year.  The category may continue to grow. Apple has said it is releasing an upgraded AirPods case this year that allows the headphones to be recharged wirelessly, like the iPhone X. The company is also working on an augmented-reality headset that would launch in 2020 at the earliest, Bloomberg News has reported.  Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman takes a closer look at Apple AirPods.

A day after, Cook said he \"wouldn\u2019t be in this situation\" if he were in Zuckerberg\u2019s shoes, in an interview with Recode and MSNBC. While Facebook makes money selling targeted advertisements based on user data, Apple\u2019s profit comes from hardware products like the iPhone, iPad, and Mac.

The Tokyo-based company, which counts Apple Inc. as one of its main customers, makes various components used in data centers. That includes ball bearings in hard drives and cooling fans, which are in high demand as the world generates, processes and stores more information. As everything from refrigerators to self-driving cars throw off information that needs to be uploaded to the cloud, data centers will be housing 1.3 zettabytes (1.3 trillion gigabytes) by 2021, more than double from this year, according to Cisco Systems Inc..  That\u2019s helped Minebea, which this month lifted its earnings outlook for the third straight quarter on strong sales of data center-related parts. Valued at almost $10 billion, Minebea is also benefiting from the success of Nintendo Co.\u2019s Switch console, which is assembled by Mitsumi, a unit acquired last year. The company\u2019s stock doubled in 2017.  Bloomberg News sat down with Chief Financial Officer Hiromi Yoda to talk about earnings growth, Nintendo, and what the zettabyte era means for his company.  How is business?  The demand for ball bearings is very strong and we\u2019re increasingly eating through our inventory. Demand from data centers in particular is very strong. We\u2019re quite surprised by growth of fan motors for cooling data centers. It\u2019s not enough to have one data center, but you need backups. And then a backup for your backup. The data you see on Instagram and other services, that keeps increasing. People aren\u2019t deleting their photos. And we\u2019re very thankful for that.  Are you planning more investment?  We still have capacity to increase by 15 million bearings annually by using space in existing factories in Thailand, which will bring capacity to 300 million by May or June. But it is becoming necessary to invest in new factories. We\u2019re considering possible locations.  How much would you be willing to spend?  We\u2019ve already invested 8 billion yen in expanding capacity, but that was within existing locations. To build infrastructure for a brand-new factory requires a number that has an extra digit. That\u2019s why we have to consider it very seriously.  Will we see profits revised higher again?  I can\u2019t speak about short-term earnings, but when we laid out our medium-term plan last May we expected operating profit to reach 100 billion yen by March 2021. It\u2019s beginning to look like we can arrive at that number a year early.  What\u2019s the outlook for the game-console assembly business?  Our customer is doing very well. We won\u2019t know next fiscal year\u2019s numbers until March. But we\u2019re not a supplier, we\u2019re an assembler. We can deal with bigger demand and won\u2019t need additional investment.  How is the merger with Mitsumi going?  The increase in efficiency is going faster than expected. The business is doing better as our customer is selling more units, but also because of our improved profitability.  You supply LCD backlights to Apple. How is that business doing?  We\u2019re actually doing better than expected. People make a big deal about how great OLED is, but it\u2019s hard to see the screen in daylight.

Apple said the base expanded 30 percent from two years ago to 1.3 billion.  That increase should have been seen as positive because Apple aims to become less dependent on selling iPhones and shift to selling its existing customers services like Apple Music or add-on devices like the Apple Watch or AirPods.  But analysts voiced skepticism. Apple's best-selling product, the iPhone, has seen relatively flat unit sales over the same two-year period. On Apple's earnings conference call, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said that the combination of trends implies users are hanging on to their devices longer, and he asked Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook whether investors should be worried about that.  Cook responded that it was up to investors to decide what to focus on, but said he was comfortable with customers buying used iPhones.  When customers sell their old iPhone for a new one, the old iPhone \"winds up with another customer somewhere else that is perfectly fine with having a previously owned iPhone. And so I view all of that to be incredibly positive. It's more people on iPhones, the better,\" Cook said.  Laura Martin of Needham & Co pressed Cook on whether the larger device base meant more devices per user, or more users - an important question, because a user with both an iPad and iPhone is likely to only purchase one Apple Music subscription, for example.  Cook said \"there are many, many, many more\" Apple users than two years ago but declined to give an actual figure.  The signals on how well Apple is monetizing users were mixed. Sales of its \"wearable\" accessories - Beats headphones, AirPods and the Apple Watch - were up 70 percent year-over-year in the fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 30. But services revenue - which includes Apple Music, iCloud and the App Store - fell short of analysts' expectations for the December quarter, at $8.4 billion, and was down slightly from the previous quarter.  Apple has yet to disclose plans for how it will distribute the television shows in which it has been investing in recent months, which could become a large business.  \"They've been building up the services business for several years, knowing full well that at some point the gravy train on smart phones is going to end,\" said Bob O'Donnell, head of Technalysis Research.

Sending intermittent notifications, or timing them based on users' locations or at purchasing opportunities, could be a more effective way for Apple to remind iPhone users of their access to Apple Pay.

Apple  Apple just finished a $5 billion headquarters, Apple Park, which some say is an architectural landmark.  Non-Apple employees are not allowed in, though, and Apple's unlikely to offer tours.  It's because there's a lot of confidential information inside the building, Apple CEO Tim Cook said.  CUPERTINO, California \u2014 Shareholders at Apple's annual meeting on Tuesday got to experience the new Steve Jobs Theater in Apple's recently opened $5 billion campus, Apple Park. But they didn't get to see inside the main \"spaceship\" building.  So one shareholder asked CEO Tim Cook: When can we get a tour of Apple Park?  The answer: Probably never. Because there are secrets inside the spaceship.  \"The problem with opening up the main facility for tours is we have so much confidential stuff around,\" Cook said. \"It's sort of the bane of my existence to hold things confidential now.\"  Cook's answer echoes a comment about the campus last year from Apple's head designer, Jony Ive, who called it \"our house.\"  \"We didn't make Apple Park for other people,\" Ive said. \"So I think a lot of the criticisms ... are utterly bizarre, because it wasn't made for you. And I know how we work, and you don't.\"  Basically, you're not going to get to experience the inside of the building without being an Apple employee with a badge.  If you have a meeting at Apple, you're generally not allowed to explore the place, people who have discussed business at Apple's headquarters have said. And Instagram photos from the interior of the building posted by employees started being removed after Business Insider published a handful earlier this month.  Cook joked with the shareholder, \"I'll send you a picture.\"  The next best thing  The augmented-reality experience Tim Cook was talking about. Kif Leswing Apple did, however, build a place for tourists on its new campus. It's across the street.  The Apple Park visitors center is a combination of an Apple Store, a cafe, and a shrine to all things Apple.  Fans and tourists are \"the reason we created the visitors center, which has the AR experience,\" Cook said, referring to Apple's augmented-reality space that includes a scale model of an Apple Park that you can animated with an iPad camera.  \"If you haven't been to this, I'd really encourage you to do it,\" he said.  He continued: \"The roof deck gives you a nice visual. We created that to give Apple users and Apple fans to get them as close to the park itself.\" From the roof deck, you can see part of the spaceship building through the trees.  While the visitors center is nice and has some products that aren't available anywhere else \u2014 including T-shirts, postcards, and Apple-branded baby clothes \u2014 it's not the inside of Apple Park.

Major technology companies are battling for dominance in U.S. schools, a market seen as important for hooking young consumers.  Apple in March 2017 lowered the price of its 9.7-inch tablet to $329, the lowest starting price ever for one of its full-sized tablets. But laptops running operating systems by Alphabet Inc's Google or Microsoft Corp can be had for less than $200.  Apple's previous price cutting, along with software changes, have been followed by an improvement in iPad sales. Analysts believe the teacher- and student-geared event on Tuesday at Lane Tech College Prep High School will include an update to its iPad lineup, including possibly a lower-priced model.  Apple made up just 17 percent of the K-12 U.S. educational market in the third quarter, according to data from Futuresource Consulting. Meanwhile 60 percent of mobile computing shipments to schools ran Google's Chrome operating system, and 22 percent had Windows.  Chromebooks sold by Dell Technologies Inc can be had for as little as $189. Microsoft last year introduced an education-focused laptop from partner Lenovo Group Ltd running Window 10 S.  Apple in recent years made changes to its operating system so that more than one student can log into an iPad, and to its software to let teachers better manage groups of students.  But it faces a tough battle in the educational market given the popularity of Google and Microsoft's cloud-based productivity suites, said Carolina Milanesi of Creative Strategies. Google's G Suite fueled Chromebook sales because it was seen as easy to use to manage assignments.  \"Most teachers don't look past G Suite for education,\" she said. Apple has iWork, which added features in recent years but remains less familiar to teachers than Google's productivity suite or Microsoft's Office.  Education sales for iPads rose 32 percent to more than 1 million units in Apple's fiscal third quarter. Sales of iPads made up just 8.3 percent of Apple's $229.2 billion total revenue last year, however, compared with the nearly 62 percent of sales generated by iPhones.  Apple needs to keep working to regain market share in schools to get children interested in its devices later on, said TECHnalysis Research founder Bob O'Donnell.  \"It's more about the psychology of driving long-term preference for the (Apple) platform. It's more strategic than financial,\" he said.

In recent weeks, Wall Street analysts have come to a consensus that iPhone X sales were slower than previously expected for the first quarter that ended in December and may drop off sharply for the March quarter.  Analysts have lowered their expectations for Apple's second- quarter revenue guidance to as low as $60 billion from a previous average of $67 billion.  Combined with concerns about the impact of an imbroglio in which Apple acknowledged slowing down phones with worn-out batteries, the weak iPhone X performance has again raised the question of whether the company can keep up its rapid revenue growth without a new hit product.  With eight different iPhone models priced from $350 to $999 on sale over the holidays, Apple showed that it has moved decisively away from co-founder Jobs' tight lineup of premium-priced products and embraced an iPhone-for-everybody strategy.  Analysts are questioning whether Apple can boost its revenue even as iPhone sales essentially plateau.  \"Apple will have to answer the question of what's next,\" UBS analyst Steven Milunovich wrote in a note to investors. \"More services to monetize the base of one billion customers and eventually enhanced [augmented reality] capabilities may be part of the answer.\"  Analysts still expect Apple to post record revenue, hitting the top of its $87 billion guidance for the holiday quarter. But they have slashed revenue estimates for the March quarter and expect the company to sell fewer iPhones in fiscal 2018 than initially thought.  Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi predicted as few as 220 million iPhones will sell in fiscal 2018, just above the 216.7 million sold in 2017 and well below the 2015 peak of 231.2 million.  BTIG analyst Walter Piecyk spotlighted a steadily lengthening replacement cycle as new iPhones offer only small improvements over prior models. Now that it has become clear that a new battery can give life to an old phone, more customers may choose to delay an upgrade, especially with Apple cutting the price of a battery replacement to $29 from $79.  Analysts still believe Apple will report sales of $272.2 billion for its fiscal 2018, 18.7 percent above its $229.2 billion in fiscal 2017. That will be driven largely by higher average prices paid for iPhones, they said.  'WILD CARD'  But Apple does not give data on specific models, and with the wider lineup, analysts must do more guesswork based on surveys and other tools. They also find it harder to predict how much money Apple makes off each phone.  \"We believe that gross margins are a key wild card for investors, given limited transparency into relative margins across iPhone [models],\" Sacconaghi said in a note to investors.  All in all, it's a far cry from the days of Jobs, who shrank the company's product lineup when he returned to the helm in 1997 and kept it limited to a few models of each product at one time until his death in 2011.  But the Apple of today has something Jobs never had: An imposing user base into which it can sell a host of other products and services.  Trip Miller, managing partner at Gullane Capital and an Apple investor, believes Apple's services segment is the firm's next hit product. Analyst expect it to hit sales of $34.7 billion this year, up 16 percent.

Some users also can\u2019t use the AirPods because of the shape of their ears. This new pair of headphones should solve this issue.

The dashboard, called Apple Music for Artists, is currently available only for select beta users ahead of a broader launch planned for later this spring.  The move is clearly a competitive measure against Spotify, which has been steadily ramping up its products for artists over the past year.  Last April, it launched its own artist dashboard out of beta, allowing artists to dive into streaming insights and analytics, manage their profile and more. In October, Spotify debuted a dedicated app for artists with access to similar data, including real-time data on new releases. That same month, it also announced the launch of its emerging artist program called RISE.  Pandora has a dashboard for artists, too, and offers tools that allow them to connect with fans using short audio messages, or to alert them about new releases, live events, ticket offers and more.  Apple, clearly, needed to catch up.  Apple\u2019s advantage with its new dashboard is that it track both streams and purchases at a granular level.  The dashboard shows the current number of plays, spins, song purchases and album purchases in its interface, going as far back as the 2015 launch of Apple Music itself. An insights panel reveals other milestones, like all-time number of plays and purchases for specific songs, or cumulatively, reports Billboard.  There\u2019s also a global map that artists can click on and drill down to the city level to see how their music is performing in that location and user demographics.

Apple will begin testing the dashboard with beta users who will provide feedback ahead of a public launch. Apple Music for Artists will open publicly later this spring for Apple\u2019s several million artists.  Of course, it\u2019s unlikely that artists will use only Apple Music\u2019s dashboard at this point.

I joined a round-table discussion with Apple SVPs and a handful of reporters to get the skinny on what was taking so long.  The answer, it turns out, was that Apple had decided to start completely over with the Mac Pro, introduce completely new pro products like the iMac Pro and refresh the entire MacBook Pro lineup. The reasoning given at the time on the Mac Pro was basically that Apple had painted itself into an architecture corner by being aggressively original on the design of the bullet/turbine/trash-can shaped casing and internal components of the current Mac Pro. There was nothing to be done but start over.  The secondary objective to that visit was to reassure pro customers who had not had news of updates in some time that Apple was listening, was working to deliver products for them and generally still cared.  Now, one year later, I was invited back to Apple to talk to the people most responsible for shepherding the renewed pro product strategy. John Ternus, vice president of Hardware Engineering, Tom Boger, senior director of Mac Hardware Product Marketing, Jud Coplan, director of Video Apps Product Marketing and Xander Soren, director of Music Apps Product Marketing.  The interviews and demos took place over several hours, highlighting the way that Apple is approaching upgradability, development of its pro apps and, most interestingly, how it has changed its process to help it more fully grok how professionals actually use its products.  After an initial recap in what they\u2019d done over the past year, including MacBooks and the iMac Pro, I was given the day\u2019s first piece of news: the long-awaited Mac Pro update will not arrive before 2019.  When we got the news that it wouldn\u2019t arrive in 2017, there was some implicit messaging that 2018 was not guaranteed either (we were told \u201cnot this year,\u201d but not \u201cdefinitely next year\u201d). This time around, Boger was succinct: the promised Mac Pro will be a 2019 product.  \u201cWe want to be transparent and communicate openly with our pro community, so we want them to know that the Mac Pro is a 2019 product. It\u2019s not something for this year.\u201d In addition to transparency for pro customers, there\u2019s also a larger fiscal reason behind it.  \u201cWe know that there\u2019s a lot of customers today that are making purchase decisions on the iMac Pro and whether or not they should wait for the Mac Pro,\u201d says Boger.  This is why Apple wants to be as explicit as possible now, so that if institutional buyers or other large customers are waiting to spend budget on, say iMac Pros or other machines, they should pull the trigger without worry that a Mac Pro might appear late in the purchasing year.  But there have been some other very interesting things going on at Apple since our last Mac Pro update, and they\u2019re shaping the future of all of its pro products.  Pro Workflow Team  In that discussion a year ago, Apple SVP Phil Schiller acknowledged that pro customers, including developers, were hungry for evidence that Apple was paying attention to their needs.  \u201cWe recognize that they want to hear more from us. And so we want to communicate better with them. We want them to understand the importance they have for us, we want them to understand that we\u2019re investing in new Macs \u2014 not only new MacBook Pros and iMacs but Mac Pros for them, we want them to know we are going to work on a display for a modular system,\u201d Schiller said.  Now, it\u2019s a year later and Apple has created a team inside the building that houses its pro products group. It\u2019s called the Pro Workflow Team, and they haven\u2019t talked about it publicly before today. The group is under John Ternus and works closely with the engineering organization. The bays that I\u2019m taken to later to chat about Final Cut Pro, for instance, are a few doors away from the engineers tasked with making it run great on Apple hardware.  \u201cWe said in the meeting last year that the pro community isn\u2019t one thing,\u201d says Ternus. \u201cIt\u2019s very diverse. There\u2019s many different types of pros and obviously they go really deep into the hardware and software and are pushing everything to its limit. So one thing you have to do is we need to be engaging with the customers to really understand their needs. Because we want to provide complete pro solutions, not just deliver big hardware, which we\u2019re doing and we did it with iMac Pro. But look at everything holistically.\u201d  To do that, Ternus says, they want their architects sitting with real customers to understand their actual flow and to see what they\u2019re doing in real time. The challenge with that, unfortunately, is that though customers are typically very responsive when Apple comes calling, it\u2019s not always easy to get what they want because they may be using proprietary content. John Powell, for instance, is a long-time logic user and he\u2019s doing the new Star Wars Han Solo standalone flick. As you can imagine, taking those unreleased and highly secret compositions to Apple to play with on their machines can be a sticking point.  So Apple decided to go a step further and just begin hiring these creatives directly into Apple. Some of them on a contract basis but many full-time, as well. These are award-winning artists and technicians that are brought in to shoot real projects (I saw a bunch of them walking by in Apple Park toting kit for an on-premise outdoor shoot). They then put the hardware and software through their paces and point out sticking points that could cause frustration and friction among pro users.  Ternus says that they wanted to start focused, then grow the team and disciplines over time.  \u201cWe\u2019ve been focusing on visual effects and video editing and 3D animation and music production, as well,\u201d says Ternus. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve brought in some pretty incredible talent, really masters of their craft. And so they\u2019re now sitting and building out workflows internally with real content and really looking for what are the bottlenecks. What are the pain points. How can we improve things. And then we take this information where we find it and we go into our architecture team and our performance architects and really drill down and figure out where is the bottleneck. Is it the OS, is it in the drivers, is it in the application, is it in the silicon, and then run it to ground to get it fixed.\u201d  This information has allowed Apple to make machines like the iMac Pro more performant, but also to enable creative users to stay in their flow and keep them moving forward. From personal experience, I can say that the times I felt most frustrated as a professional photographer using a Mac are when I had to wait. When you\u2019re taken out of your rhythm, it creates layers of frustration that can add up to you wanting to flee the platform.  \u201cThese aren\u2019t necessarily always fundamental performance issues,\u201d notes Ternus. \u201cThese aren\u2019t things that you\u2019d find in a benchmark or an automated test flow. You know we have examples where we find something\u2026 like it\u2019s a window that a 3D animator uses frequently to make some fine tweaks. The windows are not super graphically intensive in terms of processing and stewing but we have found an issue where that window was taking like 6 to 10 seconds to open and they\u2019re doing that 100 times a day, right? Like \u2018I can\u2019t work on a machine like this, it\u2019s too slow,\u2019 so we dig in and we figure out what it was.  \u201cIn that case we found something in the graphics driver was not right, and once you know where to look and you fix it, it completely changes the kind of live-on-ability for that system \u2014 the productivity for that user completely changed.\u201d  This kind of workflow analysis has enabled Apple to find and fix problems that won\u2019t be solved by throwing more hardware at them. An in-depth analysis of how workflow is affected by the whole stack of hardware and software has, Ternus says, helped them to really understand the pain points. He stresses that it\u2019s not just Apple\u2019s applications that they\u2019re testing and working to help make better. Third-party relationships on this are very important to them and the workflow team is helping to fix their problems faster too.  \u201cWe\u2019ve gone from just, you know, engineering Macs and software to actually engineering a workflow and really understanding from soup to nuts, every single stage of the process, where those bottlenecks are, where we can optimize that,\u201d says Boger. \u201cAnd to JT\u2019s point, because we build the hardware, the firmware, the operating system, the software, and have these close relationships with third parties, we can attack the entire stack and we can really ferret out where we are \u2014 we can optimize for performance.\u201d  But the Pro Workflow Team isn\u2019t just there to fix current bugs. It\u2019s also empowered to make improvements on future products, like the Mac Pro.  Future plans  \u201cWhat\u2019s really powerful through this exercise is that it\u2019s helping us to kind of map out where we\u2019re headed,\u201d says Ternus. \u201cBecause we\u2019re really digging in these workflows and figuring out how are the ways we can improve these in the future, and then that can help shape our future plans, as well.\u201d  I ask, specifically, whether this means that the Mac Pro will be shaped by this team\u2019s work.  \u201cSo it\u2019s definitely influencing the architecture of where we\u2019re going, what we\u2019re planning for,\u201d says Tom Boger. \u201cWe\u2019re getting a much deeper understanding of our pro customers and their workflows and really understanding not only where the state of the art is today but where the state of the art is going, and all of that is really informing the work that we\u2019re doing on the Mac Pro and we\u2019re working really hard on it.\u201d  I\u2019m also curious about whether the process over the last year has changed the timeline on the Mac Pro. To be blunt: Is this the original story arc of the Mac Pro\u2019s development, or are we looking at a roadmap that has a fundamentally different timeline than one year ago.  \u201cI don\u2019t think that the timeline has fundamentally changed,\u201d says Ternus. \u201cI think this is very much a situation where we want to measure twice and cut once, and we want to make sure we\u2019re building a really well thought-out platform for what our pro customers are doing today. But also with an eye towards what they\u2019re going to be doing in the future, as well. And so to do that right, that\u2019s what we\u2019re focusing on.\u201d  While there are no further details on the exact shape that the Mac Pro will take, Boger says they are still very much in the modular mindset.  \u201cAs we said a year ago, working on modular was inherently a modular system and in looking at our customers and their workflows obviously that\u2019s a real need for our customers and that\u2019s the direction we\u2019re going,\u201d says Boger.  \u201cWell, it\u2019s a need for some of them,\u201d adds Ternus. \u201cI want to be clear that the work that we\u2019re doing as a part of the workflow team is across everything. It\u2019s super relevant for MacBook Pros, it\u2019s super relevant for iMacs and iMac Pros and in the end I think it helps us in dialogue with customers to figure out what are the right systems for you. There is absolutely a need in certain places for modularity. But it\u2019s also really clear that the iMac form factor or the MacBook Pros can be exceptionally good tools.\u201d  What shape that modularity takes is another matter entirely, of course. I know some people have been pining for the days of internal expansion card configurations with standardized hardware \u2014 and maybe that is the way that this will go. But on Tuesday I also got a tour of the editing suites where Mac hardware and software is pushed to the limits, including extensive use of eGPU support, and a different vision emerges.  First, we visit the room where they record new instruments for Logic and Garage Band and then on to an edit bay used by the Pro Workflow Team to put Final Cut Pro through its paces.  Throughout, the idea of modularity was omnipresent. An iMac Pro with two iPad Pros hooked up to it allows for direct control, shortcuts and live access to the Logic manual, all while you\u2019re mixing a song on the main device: an eGPU with a MacBook Pro running a live edit of an 8K stream with color grading and effects applied.  External GPUs plugged into MacBook Pros, in my opinion, is going to be an enormous shift in the way that people think about portables. I got a live demo of a graphics stress test running on a MacBook Pro natively, then on one and then two external GPUs. The switching is nearly seamless, depending on the age of the app, and some modern rendering software can use all three in concert. It\u2019s one of those things that works exactly the way you think it would, and it leans heavily on Thunderbolt 3.  Whether that informs the shape of individual machines in Apple\u2019s future lineup I don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s certainly the way Apple is looking at the pro ecosystem. It\u2019s not just MacBook Pro, iMac Pro, Mac Pro \u2014 it\u2019s the enabling force of eGPUs, it\u2019s iPad Pros as input devices, purpose-built extensions and portable workstations. And it\u2019s even iPhone, as Logic and Final Cut Pro are both completely compatible with GarageBand and iMovie. You can start a project and continue it on iOS while traveling, then put it right back into your pro machine when you\u2019re back and continue riffing. It\u2019s Apple leaning into its advantages of having control of this stuff to the bolts.  Prommunication  With pros, Apple has three options. It can maintain the same amount of locked-down, tight-lipped comms it applies to its consumer products, where it still feels the reveal is everything.  It can utilize a \u201cwhisper campaign\u201d of on-background commentary, quiet liaisons with the developer and professional communities that filter outward in order to quell rumors or allay fears.  Or, it can choose to engage in a meaningful way with pros on their actual workflows and ingest their pain points as actionable intel that helps them head off issues before they become headlines or Medium posts or viral Twitter threads. That\u2019s what the Pro Workflow Team is all about.  One allegory I see here is when companies hire people to help fix structural problems or improve diversity, but then do not empower them to effect change.  In this case it\u2019s heartening to see that there is a straight line between the pros that Apple has hired, the conversations it\u2019s having with contractors who come in to contribute and proactive action taken on products. The work of the Pro Workflow Team is directly affecting the development of the new Mac Pro. And the iMac Pro, Final Cut Pro and macOS. They sit doors away from the engineering team running through real footage and mixing real tracks to figure out what\u2019s working and what\u2019s not. And they use a mixture of software, not just Apple\u2019s first-party stuff.  This also includes liaising with external mainstays like Adobe to figure out what their major pain points are and figuring out ways to fix them.  This isn\u2019t the expected culture of covert insularity in which Apple waits for the complaints to hit critical mass or someone to take it up as a cause before it\u2019s addressed. Frankly, a developer shouldn\u2019t have to complain to someone like me to get a company like Apple to change its mind. They should have their own representatives.  And Apple can still have its reveal. All we currently know about the Mac Pro is that it\u2019s modular and that it\u2019s being shaped by the feedback from those pros in-house, as well as external conversations with developers and professional users.  My recent conversations with Apple (including the ones cited in this piece, but not those alone) lead me to believe that they know they kept going on a path with pro customers that they felt was working long after it had, in fact, begun to erode. I\u2019m not exactly sure what the timeline was, but given the fact that the Mac Pro won\u2019t arrive until 2019, I\u2019m guessing just before the round-table discussion a year ago.  As a side note, by the way, I wouldn\u2019t expect to see any more info about Mac Pro at WWDC in June. Maybe Apple will surprise on that front, but I think for anything further about Mac Pro we\u2019re going to have to wait for next year.  In an interesting confluence of themes, I also believe that they had the same revelation recently in the education market. Apple\u2019s second go-round at capturing a big chunk of that market ran aground not on the quality of its hardware or onboard software, but on the tools that were used to deploy and manage that hardware in under-resourced school districts that had already begun to commit to web systems. Apple is starting anew there, as it has begun doing in the pro market over the last year with refreshed hardware and a new approach to addressing performance and operation issues. An interesting note, too, that when it wanted to figure out how to turn the education market around what did it do? Hired teachers and educators to tell them how it works in the real world.  As depressing as it has been to see professionals believe that Apple was getting ready to give them up, I find this an interesting and exciting thing to watch. It is very, very hard for a company like Apple \u2014 whose reputation is built on myth building \u2014 to admit that it was mistaken. And it\u2019s even harder to then change course with billions of dollars\u2019 worth of revenue at stake.  I\u2019m sure it gives a bunch of people at Apple heartburn, but it\u2019s fascinating for me because I don\u2019t have to pull it off.", "stock": "AAPL", "label": -1, "date": "2018-04-05", "source": "techcrunch", "url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/04/05/apples-2019-imac-pro-will-be-shaped-by-workflows/"}, {"article": "Apple and IBM may seem like an odd couple, but the two companies have been working closely together for several years now. That has involved IBM sharing its enterprise expertise with Apple and Apple sharing its design sense with IBM. The companies have actually built hundreds of enterprise apps running on iOS devices. Today, they took that friendship a step further when they announced they were providing a way to combine IBM Watson machine learning with Apple Core ML to make the business apps running on Apple devices all the more intelligent.  The way it works is that a customer builds a machine learning model using Watson, taking advantage of data in an enterprise repository to train the model. For instance, a company may want to help field service techs point their iPhone camera at a machine and identify the make and model to order the correct parts. You could potentially train a model to recognize all the different machines using Watson\u2019s image recognition capability.  The next step is to convert that model into Core ML and include it in your custom app. Apple introduced Core ML at the Worldwide Developers Conference last June as a way to make it easy for developers to move machine learning models from popular model building tools like TensorFlow, Caffe or IBM Watson to apps running on iOS devices.  After creating the model, you run it through the Core ML converter tools and insert it in your Apple app. The agreement with IBM makes it easier to do this using IBM Watson as the model building part of the equation. This allows the two partners to make the apps created under the partnership even smarter with machine learning.  \u201cApple developers need a way to quickly and easily build these apps and leverage the cloud where it\u2019s delivered. [The partnership] lets developers take advantage of the Core ML integration,\u201d Mahmoud Naghshineh, general manager for IBM Partnerships and Alliances explained.  To make it even easier, IBM also announced a cloud console to simplify the connection between the Watson model building process and inserting that model in the application running on the Apple device.  Over time, the app can share data back with Watson and improve the machine learning algorithm running on the edge device in a classic device-cloud partnership. \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of this combination. As you run the application, it\u2019s real time and you don\u2019t need to be connected to Watson, but as you classify different parts [on the device], that data gets collected and when you\u2019re connected to Watson on a lower [bandwidth] interaction basis, you can feed it back to train your machine learning model and make it even better,\u201d Naghshineh said.  The point of the partnership has always been to use data and analytics to build new business processes, by taking existing approaches and reengineering them for a touch screen.  \u201cThis adds a level of machine learning to that original goal moving it forward to take advantage of the latest tech. \u201cWe are taking this to the next level through machine learning. We are very much on that path and bringing improved accelerated capabilities and providing better insight to [give users] a much greater experience,\u201d Naghshineh said.", "stock": "AAPL", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-20", "source": "techcrunch", "url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/03/19/apple-ibm-extend-partnership-with-watson-core-ml-coupling/"}, {"article": "Apple is preparing a couple of updating models of AirPods, according to Bloomberg. The popular fully wireless earbud-style headphones that Apple introduced last year are currently on track for a refresh in 2018 with the addition of a new version of the \u201cW\u201d line of chips that Apple created specifically to manage and improve Bluetooth-based connections between gadgets.  The 2018 hardware refresh would include not only an improved W chip (possibly the W2 added to the Apple Watch last year, or perhaps even a W3) but also the ability to activate Siri just by voice, rather than by physically tapping the AirPod in your ear, as is the case currently.  Like with Amazon\u2019s Echo devices or the iPhone, a user would be able to trigger the virtual assistant simply by saying the wake word aloud \u2013 \u201cHey Siri,\u201d in this case. That would indeed to a step-up in terms of shifting AirPods to a voice-first interface device.  As for the successor currently planned for 2019 (though Bloomberg notes those plans could easily change between now and then), it will add a new level of water-resistance, which Bloomberg reports will be designed to protect against \u201csplashes of water and rain,\u201d rather than full submersion like the current Apple Watch.  AirPods are doing well by all accounts, so putting them on an update cycle similar to the iPhone and other of Apple\u2019s high-demand products seems fairly logical. It\u2019ll be interesting to see if customers choose to upgrade in the same way they do with Apple\u2019s other high selling devices, and what other updates might be in store (please made variable fit tip design, Apple, so that I can finally wear these things without requiring a little foam sleeve).", "stock": "AAPL", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-22", "source": "techcrunch", "url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/02/22/apple-said-to-debut-voice-activated-siri-airpods-in-2018-water-resistant-model-in-2019/"}, {"article": "While Apple continues to focus its eye on how to step up its game in the area of original content, it\u2019s also striking partnerships that could help its offensive line in one specific category: sports. The company is debuting a new section in Apple News that will be dedicated to the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang.  The Olympics section will appear in the \u201cFor You\u201d section, the part of Apple News where the platform delivers a more personalised set of stories based on publications and channels that you look at regularly.  The company will be partnering with NBC Olympics for the service, which will feature videos, articles and infographics also from a selection of sources. The portal will work outside of the US \u2014 everywhere that Apple News is live \u2014 but since NBC only holds the rights to coverage in the U.S. the video links will only appear and work there. The other partners involved are essentially Apple\u2019s other news partners.  While this Winter Olympics section will be appearing in News, the portal will be doing more than just reporting what has happened in the latest events. It will also include a planner for people to figure out what is showing when, and let you add events you want to watch to your calendar.  It will also link to live streams, although these and full replays of specific events will link outside to the NBC Sports app, Apple says. Clips from events can be watched directly within the Apple News app. There will also be a medal tracker and morning roundups for those in timezones that are far from where the games are taking place.  Apple itself has been making several moves to beef up its own content plays. The thinking is that having more exclusivity and ownership of what is provided on its own video and music services could be a way of differentiating them from the rest of the digital media pack, and potentially making them more attractive for consumers to pay to use.  Sports has not really been a huge focus in that context up to now \u2014 a deal with Spielberg and family-friendly comedies and dramas with broad appeal seem to be the order of the day. However, Apple did add a dedicated Sports tab to Apple TV in September, perhaps laying the groundwork for this and many more activities down the line.  We\u2019re in a mini-spate of tech and media companies getting their ducks in line for the big event.  The news comes a day after Google launched its own series of Olympics coverage and features. Both Google\u2019s and Apple\u2019s news hits speak to how those in the business of tech but outside the traditional business of media are looking to get their own share of audience around the Olympics, which is one of the most-watched sporting events in the world.  One thing that is not clear to me is why Apple has chosen to put its Olympics coverage in \u201cFor You\u201d.  I have two guesses. On the one hand, it will give a little more attention to the section: Apple has never detailed how much \u201cFor You\u201d is used compared to the rest of Apple News, but I\u2019m guessing what\u2019s at the top of the app is used the most when you first open it.

Yesterday, reports emerged that Apple was working on a pair of follow-ups to its Airpods headphones that could bring them always-on Siri functionality as well as a splash-proof design. As we think about all the things that Apple could do right with its next set of wireless earbuds, it\u2019s easy to reflect on all that Google did wrong with its Pixel Buds and how much of an opportunity they still have.  Google Assistant lends so much potential to a pair of smart wireless earbuds from Google. The fact is that Siri doesn\u2019t hold a candle to Google Assistant in many ways, and while the functionality of voice control on the AirPods is largely focused on music and calls, the superior intelligence of Google Assistant should make them a much clearer companion for a set of earbuds.  Hardware is still very much a side project for Google, but as the company prioritizes home assistant hardware, it really doesn\u2019t make sense that they\u2019re not putting more resources into a pair of wireless headphones. The Pixel Buds need a more purposeful design that minimizes friction and delivers Assistant insights more effortlessly in a package that feels like more than just a follow-on.  The AirPods are an engineering marvel, and while some of the functionality of the Pixel Buds was interesting \u2014 mainly their ability to interface with the Pixel 2 for language translation \u2014 they fell flat on design. Google needs to rethink its wireless earbuds from the ground-up and focus more on creating something with the sleekness of the Pixel phones rather than the fabric-obsessed friendliness of their Home devices. Cutting the woven cord and moving to a truly wireless form factor is a necessary step, as is shrinking down the size of the Bud part of the product. It\u2019s really not about the sound quality as much as it is about the connectivity and the lack of friction. While FastPair has been a great step in simplifying the bluetooth pairing, there are still some quirks that aren\u2019t present with Apple\u2019s W1 chip.  While Siri is always quick to refer you to search results when it doesn\u2019t have an answer (a frequent occurrence), Assistant\u2019s optimization for its display-free Home devices has led it to order functionality around the assumption that there\u2019s not always a screen available to default to. Today, Google announced that it was bringing location-based notifications and voice-optimized routine functionality to its Home devices so it could complete regular custom tasks without you having to pepper it with commands, stuff like this would be ideal for earbuds that are always-listening, something that Google could do much more with than Apple.  Even as features take months to roll out, Google has still shown a degree of nimbleness on the voice assistant front that Apple can\u2019t match in annual WWDC keynotes. While Amazon is just as quick with Alexa, Google Assistant\u2019s deepening integration with Android establishes an arena where they should be the clear champion.  AirPods are clearly the best wireless earbud that an Apple user can own and even with the reduced functionality that still might be true of Android phones. People are building tools to bring iOS-only feature sets to Android and that fact alone should suggest Google take a more serious look at its own hardware and the opportunity that it\u2019s losing out on.", "stock": "AAPL", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-23", "source": "techcrunch", "url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/02/23/google-needs-to-give-the-airpods-better-competition/"}, {"article": "Apple has signed a partnership with Ito World to add bike-sharing data in Apple Maps in over 175 cities across 36 countries. The feature is now live and helps you find the nearest station by typing \u201cbike sharing\u201d in the search bar or the name of the service.  Once again, Apple chose to integrate an existing data set instead of putting together this data in-house. Ito World has worked with dozens of companies to license and normalize bike-sharing data. This way, Apple only has to integrate one data model to support hundreds of bike-sharing services.  Apple isn\u2019t starting from zero as the company had already integrated some bike-sharing data in a handful of cities. But this is a big improvement over existing data.  Apple Maps doesn\u2019t tell you the number of available bikes or empty docks. I hope the company is going to add this in an upcoming update. It just gives you the address, name and contact information for the service, so this feature won\u2019t replace more sophisticated apps for local users.

Red and black seem like a good match. That\u2019s why some people even bought screen protectors with black borders to fix this.  This year, Apple is switching to black. It\u2019s interesting to see that Apple waits around 6 months before launching red versions of its iPhones. It could be a way to foster sales in the middle of a product cycle.  The red iPhone 8 is going to start at $699 with 64GB just like regular iPhone 8 models. There will be 256GB versions too. Pre-orders start tomorrow and you\u2019ll be able to buy it in Apple stores on Friday.  For iPhone X users, Apple is launching a dark red leather folio.

Photo  The best known, though, is Dinara Kasko, a Ukrainian architect-turned-pastry chef who became an internet sensation last year for her sculptural, highly geometric desserts: a cherry cake made to look like shiny red bubbles encased in a cube, and a berry-almond tart with a mazelike surface, constructed with a mold made by a 3D printer.  The link between architecture and pastry dates back at least to 1815, when the renowned French chef Marie-Antoine Car\u00eame wrote \u201cLe Patissier Royal,\u201d a treatise that codified how architectural principles like drawing and planning could be applied in pastry. Chefs have long played with the structural possibilities of sugar, egg whites, flour and other ingredients.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  But today, architectural values and technology are shaping the new norms for dessert. And while the results are carefully plotted and constructed, they are not always towering or eye-popping. In fact, this new school of pastry chefs is trying to rescue the dessert course from the outlandish unicorn cakes and mile-high ice cream sundaes that saturate Instagram.  Photo  \u201cYou have all these photos of desserts covered in rainbows and sparkles, and they might taste like sawdust, but no one knows, because it looks great on social media,\u201d lamented Jansen Chan, a former architect who is now the director of pastry at the International Culinary Center in New York and the Bay Area. \u201cInstagram is a great way for pastry chefs to communicate, but there\u2019s also the danger of people walking away from great pastry just because it\u2019s not totally visually driven.\u201d  Why have he and other chefs made such a radical career shift? In interviews, several said they realized while working in architecture that pastry required a similar skill set, and they found baking a cake a lot more interesting \u2014 and immediately gratifying \u2014 than designing a building.  Ms. Yee, 39, always wanted to be a pastry chef, but went to architecture school to placate her parents, who wanted her to have what she calls \u201ca real job.\u201d She landed a position at the San Francisco design firm Georgina Rice & Co., where she assisted in designing interiors, mostly for high-end apartments.  Photo  Tired of having to abide by mundane building codes and regulations, and wanting something more creative, she began studying pastry in 2002 at Le Cordon Bleu in London, while working as a pastry assistant at the Connaught hotel for the chefs Gordon Ramsay and Angela Hartnett.  She found that her architectural training applied in the pastry kitchen as well. \u201cBeing an architect is not all about the structure,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the intent. How will this improve someone\u2019s life?\u201d  \u201cDesserts are also about thoughtfulness,\u201d she added. \u201cWhat are the ways I can manipulate this apple? What will highlight what\u2019s grown here? It\u2019s about looking at your environment and seeing what will be functional and beautiful in that space.\u201d  Photo  Consider the \u00e9clair, Ms. Yee\u2019s signature dessert when she was the pastry chef at the French restaurant Lafayette in New York from 2013 to 2016.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  \u00c9clairs are highly technical, she said, vulnerable to everything from the level of protein in the flour to the type of oven you are using. The pastry can easily come out overly dry, or completely lose its oblong shape when baked.  But precision, for her, is only one priority. \u201cI wanted some element of spontaneity and approachability,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I garnished them, I would make the glaze a little wonky on the side, or cut the fruit on top in a random way.\u201d  Photo  That attentiveness runs through the sweet creations of Lisa Lu, 49, who oversaw the pastry department at the landmark San Francisco restaurant Boulevard from 2012 to 2017, and is now a production manager at the chocolate company Recchiuti Confections. Two decades ago, as an interior architect, she worked on creative projects like the American Licorice Company corporate headquarters in Bend, Ore., and a mock-up for a shop for the sports apparel brand UltraNectar, in the Bay Area.  \u201cHaving studied architecture,\u201d she said, \u201cI can put together a plated dessert because I understand composition \u2014 the need for balance and a focal point.\u201d  The lime tart she used to serve at Boulevard, like Ms. Yee\u2019s apple strudel, looks nothing like what a diner might expect. Ms. Lu balances a marrow-bone-shaped pastry shell filled with a tangy lime curd and pomegranate seeds on a plate, piping toasted meringue all around the tart, \u201cso that if a server wasn\u2019t careful when transporting the dessert, it would still be intact by the time it got to the table.\u201d The meringue acts like mortar, sealing the tart into place and giving the dessert stability.  Photo  \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect example of balance,\u201d Ms. Lu said. \u201cThe shell, which is designed to be open enough to be able to pipe in a curd, is the focal point. The meringue is piped in a few key areas, and then the scattered pomegranate seeds draw your eye around the plate and connect the whole dessert together.\u201d  To pastry chefs who learned the craft the old-fashioned way and don\u2019t work in the world of high-end restaurants, that kind of talk can sound like an overly cerebral or pretentious way to describe something simple: the joy of creating something sweet.  Stella Parks, a senior editor at Serious Eats and the author of the classic American dessert cookbook \u201cBraveTart,\u201d sees some good in the architectural influence on pastry, noting that it has brought more rigor into the practice.  Photo  \u201cMy worry,\u201d she added, \u201cis always that the culinary element is being forgotten. I have had so many meals at high-end restaurants that were extremely memorable, but more like a trip to a modern art museum, where you would never want those kinds of things in your own home.\u201d  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Agatha Kulaga, a self-taught baker and a founder of the New York City bakery Ovenly, agreed; architectural ideals, she said, often leave out a vital element: nostalgia.  \u201cThe usefulness of an architecture background really depends on the end goal,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can have a dessert made by a pastry chef that feels like looking at a work of art \u2014 or you can have a dessert like a cookie or a slice of cake that doesn\u2019t necessarily feel like art, but creates an experience of joy.\u201d  Photo  But Baruch Ellsworth, the pastry chef at Canlis, in Seattle, who studied architecture at a California community college, said elements like taste and emotion are essential components of the architectural pastry practice. The difference is that they are incorporated more methodically.  Both pastry and architecture, he said, are an equation: \u201cA and B always have to equal C. You can tweak A and B lots of times, but it has to add up. You can\u2019t wing it.\u201d In other words, you can be as creative as you want in your choice of flavors of ingredients, but in the end, the dessert has to be something that people will want to eat, \u201cjust like when you make a building: you can do anything as long as it won\u2019t fall down.\u201d  One of his most popular desserts explores the kaleidoscopic, shape-shifting nature of chocolate. On a single plate, there\u2019s a tobacco-infused chocolate mousse, a Madagascar chocolate brownie, a milk chocolate crisp, a cocoa nib brittle, a caramel cream with caramelized white chocolate, and white chocolate streusel \u2014 all covered in a dehydrated layer of chocolate that elegantly drapes over each component like a silk sheet.  Photo  Mr. Ellsworth compared desserts like that to the Guggenheim Museum in New York. \u201cAt first, you\u2019re like, \u2018I can\u2019t believe this is a building,\u2019 because the outside looks like a tornado,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when you go inside, you realize it is quite functional.\u201d  At the International Culinary Center in California and New York, known for turning out acclaimed pastry chefs like Christina Tosi, of Milk Bar, and Melissa Weller, the founder of Sadelle\u2019s bakery in SoHo, architecture plays a significant role in the curriculum, thanks to Mr. Chan, 42, and his architectural background.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Since 2015, the second half of the school\u2019s six-month pastry program has incorporated lessons on sketching, making timelines and project planning. Mr. Chan added a chapter called \u201cElements of Design\u201d to the school\u2019s textbook; it teaches students about architectural principles like dynamism and scale in relation to dessert.  Photo  Mr. Chan said a number of students have recently come to the school from the architecture world. \u201cThey have a much easier time at adapting because they are used to being asked questions. They are better able to express their creative ideas,\u201d he said. \u201cPastry students with no design backgrounds will be the ones to draw a tall chocolate structure with nothing holding it up.\u201d  Mr. Chan has also introduced technology into pastry education \u2014 tools like lasers, which can be used to bake and pipe batter at the same time, and water-jet cutters, used by architects to slice through sheet metal and by large-scale patisseries and hotels for cutting cakes into precise, programmed shapes in the half the time it would take a person to complete.  Not everyone endorses this approach, though. \u201cArchitecture and pastry are both very human schools of thought,\u201d said Ms. Yee, who makes the un-strudel-like strudel. \u201cYou are always thinking about what people will like. This kind of technology, to me, dehumanizes food. You\u2019re taking away the personal aspect of cooking.\u201d  Some blame technology for the glorification of social-media oddities like clear pumpkin pie, or ice cream wrapped in a cloud of cotton candy.  Mr. Chan recalled encountering a red velvet cake at a bakery in Thailand on a recent trip.  \u201cIt resembled a red velvet cake,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it didn\u2019t have any cocoa. Someone had seen it online but didn\u2019t take the time to look up what, actually, is in a red velvet cake. That\u2019s the problem with social media. You lose context.

When news broke Monday that Mr. Giannandrea was unexpectedly stepping down as Google\u2019s A.I. chief, he immediately became perhaps the most eligible tech executive on the market. By Tuesday, it became clear he was never really on the market.  Apple has made other high-profile hires in the field, including the Carnegie Mellon professor Russ Salakhutdinov. Mr. Salakhutdinov studied at the University of Toronto under Geoffrey Hinton, who helps oversee the Google Brain lab.  Apple has taken a strong stance on protecting the privacy of people who use its devices and online services, which could put it at a disadvantage when building services using neural networks.  Researchers train these systems by pooling enormous amounts of digital data, sometimes from customer services. Apple, however, has said it is developing methods that would allow it to train these algorithms without compromising privacy.  On the debate over whether humanity should be worried about the rapidly accelerating improvements in A.I., Mr. Giannandrea told MIT Technology Review in an interview last year that the concerns were overblown.  \u201cWhat I object to is this assumption that we will leap to some kind of superintelligent system that will then make humans obsolete,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand why people are concerned about it but I think it\u2019s gotten way too much airtime.

Baird & Company, wrote in a research report.  While Amazon\u2019s online store sales grew 20 percent from a year earlier, the company\u2019s total retail growth benefited from its acquisition of Whole Foods Markets. That deal, announced in June, added much of the $4.52 billion in physical store revenue for the quarter.  Yet the biggest revenue growth came from a category generically named \u201cother,\u201d which includes advertising services and rose 62 percent to $1.74 billion from a year earlier.  By far the most profitable big business for the company was Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing unit. Its revenue rose 45 percent to $5.11 billion, and its operating income increased 46 percent to $1.35 billion.  Amazon kept with its tradition of secrecy by refusing to reveal exactly how many of its Echo family of devices it sold, saying only that it sold \u201ctens of millions\u201d of them last year. The company priced the devices aggressively over the holidays \u2014 its cheapest was only $29. The devices probably did not yield much profit, though they are an important part of Amazon\u2019s effort to establish a technology ecosystem that could result in other benefits, such as enabling customers to make impulse purchases with their voices.  Photo  Apple, in contrast, is without equal in making profits from tech hardware.  For the company\u2019s fiscal first quarter, it reported a record for quarterly net income \u2014 $20.07 billion, up 12 percent from a year earlier. Revenue rose 13 percent to $88.3 billion. The gains were notable considering that Apple\u2019s fiscal first quarter was a week shorter than the previous year\u2019s 14-week fiscal first quarter.  While Amazon is content to price its devices near its costs for making them, Apple is known for charging a premium for its smartphones, tablets and computers. The iPhone X, which uses facial recognition to unlock the device, is the most expensive in its history, starting at almost $1,000.

Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said on the company\u2019s earnings call.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Mr. Cook noted that the iPhone X was the company\u2019s top-selling phone in the quarter despite its November release, roughly a month and a half after Apple\u2019s other new iPhones.  The company sold 77.3 million iPhones over the quarter, which was down 1 percent from the longer quarter a year earlier. Yet revenue was higher largely because of the pricing of the new iPhones: In addition to introducing the iPhone X, Apple raised the price of the base model of its iPhone to $699, up from the $649 starting price for past iPhones.  Sales in its \u201cother products\u201d category, which includes the Apple Watch, grew 36 percent to $5.5 billion. Apple declined to disclose sales of the Apple Watch for competitive reasons, but Mr. Cook noted on the earnings call that revenue for the Apple Watch had grown 50 percent.  Apple also highlighted money generated from services, which include the App Store and Apple Music, with revenue rising 18 percent to $8.5 billion. Apple said the App Store continued to be the top destination for smartphone customers to buy apps.  Apple sold 13.2 million iPads, up 1 percent \u2014 notable because iPad sales declined for many consecutive quarters over the last few years. But Mac sales shrank about 5 percent to 5.1 million units.  Despite strong sales of the pricey iPhone X, some analysts remained concerned that its sales were slowing. Ahead of the earnings call, some news reports said Apple was slashing production of the iPhone X for the quarter that ends in March. The reports cited supply chain partners that said Apple had cut orders for parts.  But in years past, Apple has warned investors that activities of its complex supply chain were an unreliable metric for overall sales. The company also typically slows down iPhone production after the holiday quarter, which is the peak shopping season.  Last month, Apple also unveiled plans to bring the vast majority of its $252 billion in cash held abroad back to the United States, paying a one-time repatriation tax of $38 billion. Because the company had already earmarked $36.4 billion in anticipation that it would eventually have to pay taxes on its foreign earnings, Apple did not see much impact from the recent tax code changes.

Photo  A reality check on the White House\u2019s tariff tactics  Investors last week looked at President Trump\u2019s tariffs against Chinese products and seemed to conclude that he was taking the U.S. into a trade war with China. The stock market plunged 6 percent.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Perhaps eager to stop the rout, the White House on Monday had a less confrontational message: Mr. Trump is applying one of his negotiating tactics. According to this view, the tariff proposal was a jarring move partly aimed at getting China to see that the U.S. was serious about wanting to make trade with China fairer.  From a CNBC interview with Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers:  \u201cFrom the beginning, all the way back to last summer when I arrived at the White House, the president has been clear that he wants to set a marker down with some big asks at the beginning, he doesn\u2019t want to dribble them out, and then he wants his negotiators to try to fix the trade problems. ...Hopefully, it all works out with negotiation.\u201d  Mr. Hassett\u2019s comments were in response to a WSJ article reporting that China and the U.S. were quietly engaged in trade negotiations.  Investors seemed somewhat relieved: The stock market was up 1.5 percent on Monday. Of course, if the stakes are small enough, a deal may get done in the coming months that allows both sides to claim victory. But it seems unlikely that China would quickly agree to a far-reaching overhaul of the rules that govern foreign investment in the country, a major area of dispute. Our colleagues Raymond Zhong and Paul Mozur showed the depth of the divide there.  Mr. Trump could up the ante if China shows no real signs that it will open up considerably. That could roil the markets again. The White House may want to signal that it can take market turmoil in stride. Mr. Hassett on Monday seemed to say that the White House expects market sell-offs as it pursues its trade agenda.  \u201cIf you start from a world where a bunch your intellectual technology is being stolen, then of course it\u2019s going to increase risk premiums in the short run when you try to do something about it, but in the end it should be a positive for us if we can get them to just stop them disregarding the rules of international order.\u201d  (Rising risk premiums means investors require a better return on their stocks and bonds to cover higher risks. This usually involves a decline in price to make their returns look better to prospective buyers.)  Still, the more conciliatory tone from the White House after the sell-off suggests there is not a strong desire for a full-on trade war.  \u2014 Peter Eavis  Shares of Facebook continue to slide.

Facebook\u2019s shares are down nearly 22 percent since its high in early February and off more than 18 percent since the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke more than a week ago.  To put Facebook\u2019s recent tumble in perspective: The stock is set for its worst monthly performance since August 2012. Over the past 10 days, Facebook has lost $100 billion in market value.  Despite the fall, Wall Street has not soured on Facebook. Forty-four analysts have buy ratings on the stock, compare to just two who have sell ratings, according to Bloomberg.  Photo  Tim Cook thinks regulation of Facebook is inevitable  The Apple C.E.O. said at the China Development Forum in Beijing that the government should tighten privacy regulations, after last week\u2019s revelations about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica:  \u201cI think that this certain situation is so dire and has become so large that probably some well-crafted regulation is necessary. The ability of anyone to know what you\u2019ve been browsing about for years, who your contacts are, who their contacts are, things you like and dislike and every intimate detail of your life \u2014 from my own point of view, it shouldn\u2019t exist.\u201d  Apple often uses privacy as a selling point, but Mr. Cook wasn\u2019t the only critic. Elon Musk deleted SpaceX and Tesla\u2019s Facebook pages, saying that the Tesla one \u201clooks lame anyway.\u201d Sir Martin Sorrell of the ad giant WPP said Facebook needed to \u201cstep up to the mark\u201d and be responsible for content on its platform.

Meanwhile, Facebook took out full-page ads in several British and American newspapers \u2014 including the NYT \u2014 for an apology signed by Mark Zuckerberg.  Elsewhere in Cambridge Analytica news: A volunteer for the campaign for Britain to leave the E.U. said that a Canadian data company linked to Cambridge Analytica had played a role in the organization\u2019s work. Groups campaigning against Brexit have written to Prime Minister Theresa May demanding an investigation into what members of her cabinet and her staff knew.  Andrew\u2019s take  Mr. Cook\u2019s points on privacy are absolutely right. But he has a tough needle to thread, given that Apple does business in China and acknowledges that it is \u201csubject to each country\u2019s laws\u201d that it does business in. Apple encrypts all user data and says there is no back door \u2014 and I believe that \u2014 most security and political experts have speculated that Beijing might ultimately be able to gain access iCloud data for Chinese customers: It adopted a law requiring all cloud services to be operated by Chinese companies.

Federal law enforcement officials are renewing a push for a legal mandate that would allow access to encrypted data in criminal investigations.  Dan Loeb has taken a stake in UTC.  The activist investor\u2019s fund, Third Point, has built a position in United Technologies, according to an antitrust filing.  He is the second activist investor to reveal a stake in the United Technologies during the past 30 days. On Feb. 28, Bill Ackman told CNBC that his Pershing Square had a position in the defense contractor.  Context  At a conference late last month, Greg Hayes, the chief executive of United Technologies, said the company was thinking of splitting up:  \u201cIs [United Technologies] a more valuable property together or is UTC better off in three separate businesses? That\u2019s the question for the board. That\u2019s the question we continue to study.\u201d  Shares of United Technologies are up nearly 3 percent on Monday.  USG rejects Knauf\u2019s buyout offer.  Gebr Knauf disclosed in a filing on Monday that it had offered to buy USG for $42 a share, or about $6 billion. That marked a 25 percent premium to USG closing price on Friday.  In rejecting the offer, USG said the proposal substantially undervalued the building products maker.  Knauf owns 10.5 percent of USG, making Knauf the second-largest shareholder in USG behind Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway with a 31 percent stake.  Berkshire had proposed an option for Knauf to buy Berkshire\u2019s stake in USG, according to the filing. The option would be exercisable only if Knauf bought all of USG\u2019s shares outstanding for at least $42. Berkshire proposed an option purchase price of $2 per share.  From Reuters:  The option provides a sweetener for Buffett to shed a profitable investment that originated in late 2008, at the height of the housing crisis, when Berkshire and Canada\u2019s Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd bought $400 million of USG\u2019s debt. The $2 per share cost of the option would provide Berkshire about $86.8 million upfront, based on its 43.39 million share USG stake. Berkshire would keep that money even if Knauf proved unable to buy USG.  Shares of USG are up 19 percent Monday.

Leading them: Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Liu He, Beijing\u2019s economic czar.  Among Washington\u2019s requests, in a letter to Mr. Liu, were lower Chinese tariffs on American cars and more freedom for Wall Street firms to expand in China.  Mr. Mnuchin told \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that he believed the recent rate increase by the Federal Reserve was to blame for recent market declines, not tariffs. He added, \u201cWe\u2019re not afraid of a trade war, but that\u2019s not our objective.\u201d  News of the talks have lifted markets in Asia and Europe, while S.&P. 500 futures jumped this morning.

The trouble with writing the unvarnished truth in a memoir is that it requires you to be hard not only on others, but also on yourself.  Matt Young\u2019s inventive, unsparing, irreverent and consistently entertaining \u201cEat the Apple\u201d is that, but it is also a useful corrective to the current idealization of the American soldier \u2014 or in this case a Marine. Patriotism and respect for the military is so high in this country that we have lately held a national debate over whether professional athletes should be required to stand for the national anthem. Men and women in uniform are given preference in boarding airplanes, and are so routinely thanked for their service that the expression has become rote. Each new season brings a crop of movies and glossy TV serials dramatizing the heroics of our Special Operations.  Young sees hollowness and potential harm in this.  \u201cEnforcing the idea that every service member is a hero is dangerous,\u201d he writes. \u201cLike creating a generation of veterans who believe everything they did was good.\u201d Young warns of \u201ccreating an army of fanatics.\u201d  Service deserves respect, of course, but it does not in itself guarantee stirring and selfless acts of bravery. Young is his own case in point. He sees his experience \u2014 three tours in Iraq \u2014 as far from heroic. He is at least as disturbed by his duty as he is proud of it. These contradictory feelings are a central theme in his book. Years removed, he both loathes and pines for the man he became in the Marine Corps. What he calls his \u201cPast-me\u201d was a reckless, selfish, cruel and dangerous man.

That way we can better see what happens when they are deployed. Young writes less about war here than about the culture of being a Marine, one of the few and the proud. His memoir \u2014 its title, \u201cEat the Apple,\u201d refers to a vulgar Marine proverb \u2014 is in its own way a loving portrait, but it is also unsparing, ugly and outrageous.

The chip maker only just wiggled out from under a takeover offer from rival Broadcom. What Qualcomm really needs is less a buyer and more a mediator.  There are usually two reasons to take a company private \u2014 the idea that the new owner can run it better, or a belief that the market is valuing it wrongly. Broadcom took the first path, and pointed at Qualcomm\u2019s paltry revenue growth and relatively low operating margins. Mr. Jacobs, whose father co-founded the company, is not the man to tackle those problems \u2014 if he were, he would have done it when he was executive chairman.  Valuation is a more compelling argument. It hinges on Qualcomm\u2019s rift with Apple. The iPhone maker is supposed to pay Qualcomm royalties on every phone sold, but has instructed its suppliers to hold back payment while it haggles with the chip maker on how those should be calculated.  A simple calculation shows how important this is: At $10 per phone on 250 million devices per year, Qualcomm would make $2.5 billion in revenue a year, almost all of which would flow to the bottom line. That\u2019s equivalent to a lump-sum value of perhaps $17 billion, assuming a tax rate of 21 percent and margins of 85 percent. If investors aren\u2019t pricing in any Apple royalty at all right now, that\u2019s enough to justify a price close to the $117 billion Broadcom offered.  Mr. Jacobs, however, is not the right person to mend the rift with Apple. One person who could, in theory, is SoftBank\u2019s Masayoshi Son. The Japanese investor has a longstanding relationship with Apple \u2014 and counts both Apple and Qualcomm as investors in his Vision Fund, which is also one of the financial companies Mr. Jacobs reportedly has been asking to finance a bid. Conceivably, he could help them split the difference.  Would SoftBank\u2019s founder be up for the gig? Qualcomm, as a leader in 5G, is a trophy asset, and having Mr. Jacobs on board might neutralize some of the fear of foreign ownership that destroyed Broadcom\u2019s bid. But Qualcomm is also politically sensitive, a supplier to SoftBank already \u2014 and very big. Even with help, Qualcomm is probably too big a bite for SoftBank to chew. Mr. Jacobs, and Mr. Son for that matter, can use their daring to better effect elsewhere.", "stock": "AAPL", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-16", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/16/business/dealbook/qualcomm-apple-mediator.html"}, {"article": "Apple may be dealing with the fallout for a while. The company published a lengthy memo in December saying that smartphone batteries became less effective over time and that its software was intended to prevent iPhones with older batteries from unexpected shutdowns. Apple also apologized to customers for the slowdowns, offered discounts for its battery-replacement program and said it would introduce software to gain visibility into the health of an iPhone battery.  Yet since then, consumer advocacy groups have filed lawsuits against the company for failing to disclose that the software would throttle old iPhones. The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission have also started an inquiry into the matter, according to a person with knowledge of the situation, who asked not to be named because the details were confidential. Bloomberg earlier reported the inquiry.  Early Wednesday, Apple said in a statement that it had received questions from some government agencies and that it was responding to them; the company did not specify the agencies it had heard from. The Justice Department declined to comment.  As for the wait times that Ms. Schipper and others are experiencing for a battery replacement, a spokeswoman referred to Apple\u2019s support webpage, which states that battery supplies at its stores may be limited.  Let\u2019s not wait around. Here\u2019s a guide to other solutions to keep an iPhone running in the absence of an Apple battery replacement.  Third-Party Repair Shops  Plenty of irate Apple customers are turning to local third-party repair shops to get their iPhone batteries replaced. At Mega Mobile Boston, twice as many customers are coming in for iPhone battery replacements than in years past, said Adam Fullerton, the store\u2019s operations manager.  Third-party repairs are a decent \u2014 but imperfect \u2014 solution. One drawback is that they vary in quality; some repair shops buy lower-quality batteries that don\u2019t last. So to find a good shop, rely on word of mouth and reviews on the web, similar to how you might seek out a good car mechanic.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Another issue is that if you service your phone with a third-party battery and later take your device in to Apple for repair, the company could refuse to service your phone. So if you go the third-party route, chances are you will have to stick with third-party repair shops through the end of your phone\u2019s life.

View all New York Times newsletters.  There\u2019s a less risky route here. On Apple\u2019s support webpage, you can look up third-party repair shops that are authorized by Apple as service providers. These are fixers who have been trained by Apple and carry original parts. But the list is short.  If you find a good local fixer, there are plenty of benefits to sticking with one long term. For one, third-party shops tend to have shorter waits. Mr. Fullerton said his shop could typically get an iPhone battery replacement done in about 30 minutes. The process involves opening the device, cleaning away the old waterproofing adhesive, replacing the battery and applying a new waterproofing adhesive.  For another, local repair shops make their prices competitive with the manufacturer\u2019s. In the case of batteries, many shops are discounting their battery replacements to match Apple\u2019s $29 pricing.  \u201cWe\u2019re probably losing money on it with the cost of a half-hour time from a technician,\u201d Mr. Fullerton said. \u201cBut it\u2019s like a loss leader in any other industry. If you\u2019re Best Buy and you get them to buy one item at cost, maybe you can teach them something about your business.\u201d  Finding a good repair shop can feel daunting, but if you ask around, your peers will probably have recommendations. For a sample, here\u2019s a list of highly recommended repair shops in the United States that I compiled from talking to repair experts I trust:  \u25a0 In Chicago: uBreakiFix Chicago  \u25a0 In San Francisco: MacRepair  \u25a0 In New York: Simple Mac  \u25a0 In Boston: Mega Mobile Boston  \u25a0 In Washington: Computer Geeks  \u25a0 In Austin, Tex.: Austin Mac Repair  Fix It Yourself  You can always replace an iPhone battery by yourself. The pros: You can choose the best components for repairs and minimize costs. The cons: Learning repairs can be time consuming, and if you mess up, you have no one to blame but yourself. And again, Apple stores could refuse to service your phone if it sees you have repaired it with third-party parts.  A good place to start for D.I.Y. repairs is iFixit, a company that provides instruction manuals and components for repairing devices. It is offering discounts on battery replacement kits for older iPhones, which cost $17 to $29. Each kit includes a new battery and the tools for disassembling iPhones.  Installing a phone battery can be intimidating. Replacing an iPhone 7 battery, for example, requires eight tools and 28 steps. Kyle Wiens, the chief executive of iFixit, said some customers also opted to buy a battery from iFixit and then take it to a local repair shop for installation.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Carry a Battery Pack  If you don\u2019t feel confident hiring a third-party fixer or installing your own battery, you can always wait for Apple to replace your battery. But since that could take weeks or months, don\u2019t suffer with a sapped phone battery in the meantime.  A better temporary solution is to invest in a battery pack that you can carry around until replacement batteries arrive at an Apple store. Wirecutter, a New York Times company that reviews products, has tested hundreds of battery packs to recommend a few. My favorite is the Anker PowerCore 20100, which can charge a smartphone every day for a week.  Ms. Schipper, the Seattle resident, is considering buying a battery pack. In the meantime, she is constantly plugging her iPhone into a power outlet because her battery lasts only two hours a day.  Yet she has resisted what she thinks Apple wants: for her to buy a new phone.  \u201cI was tempted to just chuck this phone and suck it up and spend $1,000-plus and get the iPhone X,\u201d she said. \u201cI said, \u2018No, darn it, I have a budget I\u2019m saving up.\u2019 I\u2019m not going to let Apple push me around.\u201d", "stock": "AAPL", "label": -1, "date": "2018-01-31", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/31/technology/personaltech/iphone-battery-slowing-down.html"}, {"article": "Photo  The vast majority of Americans expect artificial intelligence to lead to job losses in the coming decade, but few see it coming for their own position.

Apple has some catching up to do. Mac laptops and iPads were once the dominant devices in American classrooms, but Google has shot past Apple with inexpensive laptops called Chromebooks. Google has also led the way in software products designed specifically for schools, with an app called Google Classroom that teachers use to take attendance, assign homework and do other tasks, among others.  Of the 12.4 million tablets and laptops shipped to primary and secondary schools in the United States last year, Chromebooks accounted for 58 percent of the market, compared with a negligible share in 2012, according to IDC. In the same period, the share of iPads and Mac laptops fell to 22 percent from about half. And Microsoft Windows devices dropped to 18 percent from about 45 percent, IDC said.  School districts embraced Chromebooks because they were comparatively inexpensive and easy to use. Since the laptops were cloud-based, they could be shared among students who could pick up any device to get access to their documents. And school districts could use a software dashboard to manage thousands of devices at once. Districts that needed to institute online testing began buying Chromebooks in bulk.  Still, Apple generates the most revenue from school hardware sales in the United States, partly because its devices cost more. Of the $5.4 billion spent on school devices last year in the United States, Apple\u2019s iPads and laptops accounted for about $2.1 billion, followed by Chromebooks at $1.95 billion and Microsoft Windows devices at $1.35 billion, according to IDC.  Photo  Apple\u2019s new iPad signals how the company sees an opening at the lower end of the market. Last year, it lowered the price of its entry-level iPad to $329 for consumers and $299 for schools, helping to bolster sales of iPads after years of declines. Some Chromebooks and Windows laptops cost less than $200.

But an analysis of nearly 7,000 tweets using the hashtag #BoycottGoogle since August showed that 26 percent of the tweets came from devices using Google\u2019s Android software, according to Keyhole, a social-media research firm.  One Twitter account named Milton Prescott tweeted on Aug. 8: \u201cGoogle\u2019s firing of James Damore proves his point completely. I will no longer be using Google for any services. #BoycottGoogle.\u201d The tweet came from an Android device. A message to the account went unreturned.  Even Breitbart is running into the same dilemma. The conservative website is planning to host a panel on how tech platforms like Facebook suppress conservative voices \u2014 and it said it would livestream the discussion on Facebook. Breitbart didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.  Marisa Richardson, a program manager at a life-sciences company, said she began boycotting Amazon recently after learning that it offered the NRA channel on its streaming-video service. So when she needed laundry detergent, she avoided the e-commerce site and instead braved the crowds and traffic \u2014 and spent a few dollars more \u2014 at a nearby Target.  But a few days later she shopped at the Whole Foods near her home in Oakland, Calif. \u201cI completely forgot that they\u2019re owned by Amazon,\u201d she said.  After the shooting in Parkland in February, gun-control activists called for a boycott of certain Apple and Amazon services because they hosted the NRA channel.  Photo  People used the hashtag #March1NRABoycott to spread the message on social media. An analysis of about 58,500 tweets with the hashtag showed that nearly half came from an iPhone or an iPad, according to Keyhole. Those included popular tweets using the #March1NRABoycott hashtag from the actress Alyssa Milano.  \u201cHad I sent the same tweets from an Android phone, the same issue would apply. There is an NRATV app for Android phones,\u201d Ms. Milano said through a spokeswoman. \u201cWe are only just beginning to understand how these companies have infiltrated not only our ideologies, but also our lives in the most in-depth way imaginable.\u201d  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Nearly a third of the 4,700 tweets using the #BoycottApple hashtag since August came from iPhones, according to Keyhole.  \u201cI do have an iPhone, but as a customer of Apple\u2019s, am I not allowed to hold them accountable?\u201d Mr. Knight, the activist who used an iPhone to call for an Apple boycott, said in an interview.

Facebook, Google and Amazon didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.  Many of those who recently abandoned their Facebook accounts are still in the company\u2019s orbit, not only with Instagram but also with the company\u2019s popular messaging apps WhatsApp and Messenger.  When Cher recently deleted her Facebook page, she said on Twitter, \u201c2day I did something VERY HARD 4 me.\u201d But her Instagram account, with 768,000 followers, was still active.  Likewise, Elon Musk, chief executive of SpaceX and Tesla, deleted the Facebook pages of both companies \u2014 but left their pages and his personal account active on Instagram. The photo-sharing platform, he said on Twitter, is fine \u201cso long as it stays fairly independent.\u201d  Stephen Cox, 39, a woodworker in Los Angeles, recently posted on Facebook that he was deactivating his account in favor of Instagram. When someone commented that the two sites were owned by the same company, he replied, \u201cIt\u2019s a double-edged sword, but for me one edge is slightly more blunt than the other.\u201d  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Instagram has proved an effective hedge for Facebook against people losing interest or trust in its main site. While the percentage of American adults who use Facebook has remained flat at 68 percent since 2016, according to a January survey of 2,002 American adults by the Pew Research Center, Instagram use rose to 35 percent from 28 percent over that period. Instagram is also more popular with younger people than older people, according to the survey.  Rayven Bruzzese, 26, a sign-language student in Philadelphia, said she had been a frequent user of Facebook for years but deleted her account in March because she found it upsetting and a drain on her time. Now she spends her time on Instagram.  While she acknowledged the irony of moving to another Facebook-owned service, she said her options were limited. Few of her friends are on Twitter, and many have stopped using Snapchat.  \u201cWhere am I supposed to go?\u201d she said. \u201cI wish there was something else.\u201d", "stock": "AAPL", "label": 1, "date": "2018-04-01", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/01/business/boycott-facebook-apple-google-failed.html"}, {"article": "Ecommerce portal Flipkart has announced the Apple Days sale on its website, offering discounts and cashback offers on various products including iPhones, MacBooks, iPads and the Apple Watch Series.

In the former category, the HomePod is excellent, with amazing sound and incredibly intuitive set-up. But in the latter Siri is only middling in its implementation, and the fact that you're not able to break out of the Apple ecosystem for many key functions also rankles.  Apple\u2019s devices have evolved hugely over the last 15 years or so, changing the brand from the rebooted upstart that gave us the iPod to the consumer tech powerhouse of today.  The HomePod takes the name of that iconic portable device, but a decade and a half on we're faced with the same question posed by previous Apple gadgets: how much of a premium should you pay for owning a device that fits seamlessly into the Apple ecosystem?  Let's not forget that the HomePod is a late entry to the smart speaker game, but that\u2019s standard operating procedure for the Cupertino-based brand: let the rest of the industry stride ahead with a new form factor, identify the issues and then offer something that \u2018just works\u2019... and generally for a higher price than the competition.  That\u2019s what\u2019s happened with the HomePod, although not in quite the same way as before. There\u2019s no denying that the sound quality of Apple\u2019s speaker is top-notch, but in a marketplace where Amazon has such an entrenched smart speaker/voice assistant ecosystem and Google isn\u2019t far behind, can a great-sounding-but-imperfect device be worth buying?  The HomePod is understated in the house.  As intimated, the HomePod price isn't a cheap speaker \u2013 the price is a weighty $349 / \u00a3319 / AU$499, and the speaker began shipping on February 9 in selected territories.  That makes it one of the most expensive smart speakers on the market \u2013 and certainly the most expensive mainstream option \u2013 but Apple is hoping to justify that price by embedding Siri inside and offering premium-quality audio.  Set-up  By far the easiest smart speaker to set up  Capable of reading own surroundings  It's a heavy box to bring home...  The Apple HomePod is so, well, Apple in the way you\u2019ll use it. As with the AirPods, simply hold your phone near the unit and your handset will send over your Apple ID and Apple Music preferences, and fill in all the long-winded Wi-Fi passwords that you\u2019re proud you remember but thankfully don\u2019t have to type in.  The set-up process was only delayed for us by the fact that we needed to upgrade to iOS 11.2.5 on our iPhone, which is a prerequisite for making the speaker work.  That highlights one key thing about the HomePod: you\u2019ll need to have an iPhone or iPad to set it up in the first place.  It\u2019s hard to see why you\u2019d buy this speaker without owning one of those already, but it trims the target audience down right from the outset.  The speaker glows pleasantly during setup  However, the set-up process does highlight one of the nice features of the HomePod: the glowing light on the top (which turns into the multi-colored Siri logo when you\u2019re issuing commands to it later on).  The whole process is so swift though \u2013 compare it to the long-long-long-winded set-up process for the Amazon Echo or Sonos One \u2013 and you\u2019ll be so glad that you don't have to spend a minute wafting your iPhone around the room to calibrate the sound levels.  Holding your phone near the speaker calls up this box  Add to that further such conveniences in day-to-day use \u2013 if you need to use a new Wi-Fi network that's already set up on your phone, you just literally hold the phone nearby and it's done \u2013 and you can see how Apple has smashed the competition when it comes to ease of use, one of its real hallmarks.  The HomePod will actually just work out where it is within the room simply by playing some music \u2013 it\u2019ll assess its physical surroundings by hearing how the sound it emits bounces around, and if there\u2019s a wall behind it will send certain sections of what you\u2019re listening to that way, while the main vocals or instruments will fire forwards.  Seven steps and the speaker is ready to go.  If it's not adjacent to a wall then the HomePod will chuck the sound out in a 360-degree space, although in most cases we\u2019d imagine people would use the speaker up against a wall.  After that\u2019s all set up, you can leave the house with your iPhone and your family or housemates will still be able to use the speaker, although you can turn off \u2018personal requests\u2019 based on your information if you don\u2019t want other people meddling with your business.  (Thankfully you can also stop requests to the speaker messing with your music listening history \u2013 if you\u2019re trying to build decent automated playlists on Apple Music, your housemates playing Justin Bieber and Moana on repeat won\u2019t ruin everything.)  Design  Understated design  Much heavier than expected  If you\u2019re thinking of picking up the HomePod you may want to go with both hands to start with. That\u2019s because this speaker is incredibly dense, packing 2.5kg of weight into its 172mm (6.8-inch) high frame.  It feels a good deal heavier than it looks, and that\u2019s because there are so many speakers in there. We\u2019re talking a woofer and seven tweeters, each with its own amplifier, and six microphones spread around to help pick up your voice when you're hailing Siri.  And once its placement is locked in, you\u2019ll need to answer one more question: how are you going to run the power lead that comes out the back? It\u2019s the only wire on this device, and the only thing that resembles a port too. There\u2019s no other physical connectivity on offer, which sadly means no aux-in port for connecting up a record player or other device.  We do not recommend placing your HomePod in front of a fire for any length of time.  All you\u2019ve got is a squat little speaker covered in an \u2018acoustic mesh\u2019 that\u2019s designed to protect the device while letting out as much sound as possible. It looks as unremarkable as you\u2019d expect \u2013 there are no decorative flourishes here \u2013 and the only break in the mesh is on the top, where a round, reflective disc sits.  This is, as we've mentioned, where the glowing light pulses, signifying when Siri is listening and processing commands, and it's also where you'll find the plus and minus icons for adjusting the volume.  Pushing the speaker against a wall brings the best audio performance.  It\u2019s a shame there\u2019s no haptic feedback from the buttons, but given that most of the time you\u2019re going to be controlling the HomePod with your voice it's not a big deal.  The HomePod isn't the most aesthetically pleasing speaker out there, but it's attractive in its simplicity. Some might think that, for the price, it should be more striking, but the speaker is certainly well-made.  And be warned - the Apple HomePod can leave a white ring underneath if you leave it on certain surfaces (mostly more expensive, porous wood). Apple has acknowledged this and says it should wipe off, or disappear after a few days, but other claims state that it can leave a more permanent ring. Either way, think about where you place the speaker, as the vibration causes a reaction between the silicon base to the wood thanks to the deeper bass.  We had our speaker on a wooden surface in our testing, but it was a thinner (well, cheaper) wood, and found no example of the staining... but it seems that more porous, expensive veneers are those in danger.  In terms of processing, the HomePod is equipped with Apple\u2019s A8 chip, created to be used in the iPhone 6 from 2015. That may sound a little old, but given that it was designed to power a whole smartphone, it\u2019s actually quite a lot of power for \u2018only\u2019 a speaker, even one that\u2019s sending and receiving commands to and from the cloud on a regular basis.  Audio performance  Sublime audio performance  No Bluetooth streaming or aux input  The audio quality of the Apple HomePod is, to put it simply, premium. It fills a room easily, with clear separation between all elements of music tracks.  It's certainly at its best when placed against a wall, pulling apart the sounds well, with elements such as voices coming through with incredible breadth.  We're probably all used to hearing music of various quality throughout our day, from poor-quality headphones to whatever speakers our TV has, so using the HomePod will expose a lot of people who aren't audiophiles to new subtleties in music which they may not have heard before.  You can ask Siri to read the news or a message out when in the kitchen if you've got your hands full.  The bass, in particular, is strong, but like most sounds emanating from the speaker the audio is stable, with sharp notes clipping very well. Listening to electronica, in particular, offered a lot of clarity, while bass guitar sounds brought a slight reverberation to the sound \u2013 those with an untrained ear in particular will be blown away.  But it's the fusion of all this that's impressive \u2013 being able to hear thudding bass (a teeny bit too thudding at times, it has to be said) while at the same time being treated to crystal-clear vocals on top is a lovely experience.  Sometimes you'll feel that things can get a little mixed together \u2013 bass guitar can be a touch muddy, or something like a violin can be easily overpowered \u2013 but compared to a cheap, low-end speaker the quality is just miles and miles ahead.  The HomePod is loud too, with Siri asking if you definitely want to do that when you ask the speaker to play at full volume. And if there are any sound effects on a track, be it water splashing, rain or a faux-vinyl sound, the crispness again is amazing.  In fact, the audio quality is so good that the biggest criticism we can level at the audio capabilities of the speaker is how you interact with it. Saying \u2018Hey Siri\u2019 over and over to achieve anything irks, and if you\u2019re in a room with multiple people talking you\u2019ll need others to shush otherwise their words are easily picked up, leading to random songs being played.  The base of the speaker is on the only place you'll find an Apple logo  It would be nice to somehow have your intentions registered without the need for a key phrase.  Comparing the HomePod to the new Amazon Echo and the Sonos One, though, it bests both of them easily. Leaving aside the simple set-up, which is a godsend, the sound from Apple's speaker is the most expansive and clear... it just feels like there's more information flooding into your ears.  The Amazon Echo is obviously the lowest-quality of the three in terms of sound quality, but it's not terrible. Listen to it in isolation and you'll like how it sounds, especially for the price. But the HomePod just destroys it with the level of audio on offer, making music sound, well, 'proper'.  The Sonos One is understandably much closer to the HomePod when it comes to audio performance, but it's not quite as good \u2013 the only way we can describe it is as being 'narrower' in its sound, with the volume and breadth of the audio not matching Apple's efforts.  That's not to say the Sonos One's sound quality isn't hugely clear and evocative \u2013 it thoroughly is \u2013 but there's just more power and depth from the HomePod.  But now we get onto how you actually listen to things on the HomePod, and therein lies the rub. You need a subscription to Apple Music unless you just want to stream stuff from your iPhone \u2013 and even that can only be done using AirPlay.  We say 'only' because you can't stream over Bluetooth to the HomePod. That's not a massive issue if you'll only ever want to play audio from an Apple product, but if you've got something else that can be used to stream Bluetooth music you're out of luck.  Similarly, with no aux input you won't be able to use the premium sound of the HomePod to play your CDs, or your vinyl collection if you've jumped on that particular bandwagon.  We can see the argument for not offering Bluetooth streaming \u2013 despite there being a Bluetooth connection on board to enable the HomePod to talk to other smart home devices \u2013 but not having an aux input is a missed opportunity.  So, given the above, how are you supposed to get the most out of your HomePod? With the aforementioned Apple Music \u2013 meaning you're essentially going to need to pay $10 / \u00a310 a month to keep using your new speaker.  You'll barely use the volume buttons on the top of the speaker.  If you're already paying that, no problem \u2013 but if you're currently a Spotify user you won't be able to use that service without streaming it over your phone, which isn't ideal \u2013 you can still control the music using your voice in this mode, but it's a lot slower to respond.  The fact that you're pretty much locked to Apple Music makes it all the more curious that Apple doesn't have a lossless format, like Tidal, given that the HomePod is tailored for such high-end sound.  Perhaps that's coming in the future. Or perhaps Apple thinks the sound is good enough with what's there \u2013 and as we've said, it is great.  But the fact that you can only use Apple Music rankles, further highlighting how you need to be deeply embedded in the Apple ecosystem to get proper use out of the HomePod.  Speaking of the future, when Apple debuts AirPlay 2 later in the year you\u2019ll be able to link two HomePods together to get stereo sound. We had a brief demo of this, and it sounds, well, pretty much like two speakers making more noise together. The quality was equally as high, just more spread out and that sounded better.  With AirPlay 2 you\u2019ll also be able to spread your sound to other speakers \u2013 not just HomePods \u2013 and other AirPlay 2-enabled devices around the house.  We tried it with the Apple TV, and while the sound was brilliant we had to dive into the settings every time to tell the TV to play the sound through the speaker. Having two HomePods proudly sitting either side of the screen and automatically playing the audio from Netflix or whatever would be great.", "stock": "AAPL", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-12", "source": "techradar", "url": "http://www.techradar.com/reviews/apple-homepod-review"}, {"article": "There's a new limited period offer for the iPhone X buyers.

On a support page detailing the \u2018feature\u2019, Apple has confirmed that \u201cThis power management feature is specific to iPhone and does not apply to any other Apple products.\u201d  So why is the iPhone affected and nothing else? Well, we don\u2019t know for sure, but Apple is slowing older phones down to stop them unexpectedly shutting down, which can happen during performance peaks when the battery is older or at a low state of charge.  Bigger is better  GSMArena notes that as iPads have larger batteries than iPhones they\u2019ll be better able to handle performance peaks, and they also tend to be charged less frequently than a phone, which means their batteries don\u2019t wear out as quickly, all of which means that slowing them down should be less necessary. The same should also apply to MacBooks.

It didn't deviate much.  That's okay. It just means there's another Apple event to come, with the next one being Apple WWDC 2018 on June 4. We expect a lot of newness there \u2013 and at the next iPhone event likely in September \u2013 that we didn't see today.  Specifically, in 2018, we're anticipating new Mac computers, new mobile devices, new wireless accessories, and new software for all of your Apple-made technology.  Here's everything Apple still has to announce this year.  1. The new MacBook Air  A new MacBook Air would have been a great addition to Apple's education event, but it would have also instantly distracted from the new iPad 2018. That's why we feel as though the company's entry-level computer may debut at WWDC instead.  Apple's affordable 13.3-inch laptop is expected to get a refresh, with modern specs (the current Air is stuck at a 5th generation Intel Core i5 and Core i7 processors; other laptops are up to 8th gen) and finally bump the screen resolution up to Retina.  2. AirPower wireless charger  It's not hard to find wireless chargers, but Qi chargers that can recharge multiple devices are a rather new thing. We're seeing a few come onto the scene now, including Lxory Dual Wireless Charging Pad and, soon, the Belkin Boost Up Dual Wireless Charging Pad.  That's all the more why Apple should be weeks away from finally launching the AirPower charging pad it previewed at the iPhone X launch event last year. It can charge up to three devices at once, including an iPhone (iPhone X, iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus so far), an Apple Watch, and the new AirPods case.  3. AirPods 2 with wireless charging  Going along with the AirPower charging pad, if you really want to wireless charge your AirPods, you're going to need the new AirPods wireless charging case. Whether or not Apple calls this AirPods 2 remains a big mystery, but it's definitely going to be a new iteration.  We expect Apple to start selling the new AirPods with and without the untethered EarPods. The latter option is ideal for all of the current AirPods owners who just want the wireless case without the extra expense.  Previous news: Apple AirPods 2 and 3 could be coming in 2018 and 2019  4. iPad Pro with Face ID  Apple's education event wasn't the last we've heard from the iPad in 2018, according to the most recent rumors. We also expect a redesigned iPad Pro before the end of this year.  It was too soon to launch a new iPad Pro today \u2013 we just got the iPad 10.5 and iPad 12.9 tablets at WWDC last year. We're thinking Apple may be ready for a new set of slates at a September iPhone launch event. That's much better timing. New features could include a TrueDepth camera for Face ID and Animoji, and less bezel. Hopefully that makes the bigger 12.9-inch iPad Pro body smaller without actually reducing the screen size.  5. Mac Pro 2018  Apple promised that we'd get a new Mac Pro by the end of 2018, and it's previously teased the new rig as an 'upgradeable\u2019 and \u2018modular\u2019 desktop computer.  This isn't a rumor. Apple called it \"a completely redesigned, next-generation Mac Pro architected for pro customers who need the highest performance, high-throughput system in a modular, upgradeable design.\" That's a big change in direction since the trash can design of the Mac Pro 2013 didn't offer much in the way of upgradeable space. Apple had admitted as much and is out to change that with the new Mac Pro 2018.  6. iPhone XI, iPhone XI and cheaper iPhone  Apple skipped over the iPhone 7S name and we're not sure what's happening with the iPhone 9 moniker. But we fully expect there to be a new iPhone X this year, and it could be called the iPhone XI or iPhone X2. Whatever the name is, expect it to be rather iterative with the same 5.8-inch screen.  The true standouts of 2018 will be a larger iPhone XI, rumored to have a 6.5-inch AMOLED screen, and also cheaper iPhone X with a 6.1-inch LCD at a less intimidating price. The latter option could be Apple's next-generation take on an iPhone SE.  7. Apple Watch 4  The Apple Watch 4 may finally give us a redesign to Apple's iPhone-compatible smartwatch \u2013 the first new look since the original Apple Watch launched in 2015.  It'll have a 15% larger screen and more battery life, according to the most recent report by one noted Apple analyst. That doesn't mean the body will be 15% larger, thankfully. The current Apple Watch 3 (and all Watch models) have bezel to spare. And more battery life could allow Apple to issue its own sleep tracking software, too.  8. New software  The real star every year at Apple's WWDC keynote is software. It's why Apple app developers show up to the San Jose event \u2013 to make good app you'll download.  This year, we expect to see iOS 12 with fewer new features in favor of more stability and allow iOS apps to run on macOS computers. Ideas like a home screen redesign and default app revisions may be saved for iOS 13. Going along with this, we expect to see macOS 10.14, watchOS 5, and tvOS 12 at WWDC, too.", "stock": "AAPL", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-28", "source": "techradar", "url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/apple-2018-announcements"}, {"article": "Finding the best cheap Apple Watch deals is no easy task simply because this is the newest product category among Apple devices and the Apple Watch 3 version with LTE is is still new and expensive.  Our best tip for April 2018 is to ditch the LTE - as the standard Apple Watch 3 has all of the top features of the new watch without the expensive connection - or just go for the still-excellent Apple Watch 2. There's a lot of money savings to be had.  Yes, the Apple Watch 3 is the best Apple Watch you can buy today; however, the refreshed Apple Watch Series 1 or 2 are just as good for most people. Make sure you pick wisely.  Here\u2019s a list of the best Apple Watch deals for April 2018, from the first version of the Watch to the latest. We also threw in a few places to buy cheap Apple Watch bands a little more cheaply than you can pick them up from Apple.  Apple Watch Series 3  A modest - but impressive - upgrade  OS: watchOS 4 | Compatibility: iOS | Display: 1.65\" OLED | Processor: S3 dual-core | Onboard storage: 8GB | Battery: 18 hours | Charging method: Wireless | IP rating: IPX7 | Connectivity: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC, GPS Cellular  Altimeter  Cellular options  Music streaming with cellular  LTE isn't good value  Battery life needs to be longer  The new regular Apple Watch 3 and Apple Watch 3 LTE delivers a really minimal upgrade, unliked the new iPhone X. The latter version essentially just adds in connectivity to its latest wearable. This basic Series 3 model though can only be called an incremental upgrade over the Apple Watch 2.  If you're not that bothered about being connected wherever you are - or don't want to pay extra for the capability - you might want to look at the older Apple Watch Series 2 deals below and save yourself some money.  Apple Watch 2 deals  Fitness takes over the Apple Watch  OS: watchOS 4 | Compatibility: iOS | Display: 1.53\" OLED | Processor: S2 dual-core | Onboard storage: 8GB (only 2GB and 75MB allowed for music and photos, respectively) | Battery: 18 hours | Charging method: Wireless | IP rating: IPX7 | Connectivity: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC  Water-resistant  GPS onboard  Expensive  Lack of useful apps  The Apple Watch 2 isn't being sold by Apple, but it's still being pushed around by various retailers for those who want the older, but very similar, Watch on the cheap.  It includes specs and features not available for the cheaper Apple Watch Series 1. This includes GPS tracking, a brighter screen and waterproof specs that allow you to wear it in the pool - which can also be found on the Watch 3.  All of that sounds great, until you see the expensive price tag, especially for the Ceramic Apple Watch 2.  Aluminum cases make for the cheapest Apple Watch 2, followed by stainless steel and ceramic. There\u2019s no gold model any more, but more intricate Apple Watch bands do lead to higher prices. In other words, you have to shop smartly when picking out your Apple Watch 2 below - but it's a much better option for most when looking for the more sport-enabled Watch.  Read our full review: Apple Watch 2  Apple Watch Nike Plus deals  The Nike-flavored Apple Watch 2 and 3  OS: watchOS 4 | Compatibility: iOS | Display: 1.53\" OLED | Processor: S2 dual-core / improved in Watch 3 | Onboard storage: 8GB (only 2GB and 75MB allowed for music and photos, respectively) | Battery: 18 hours | Charging method: Wireless | IP rating: water-resistant IPX7 | Connectivity: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC  Water-resistant  GPS onboard  Limited fitness app  Not always accurate  Right - let's clear this up: there are two Nike+ editions of the Apple Watch. The first is the Nike+ Apple Watch Series 2, and the second the Nike+ Apple Watch Series 3.  Both are virtually identical to the 'standard' version of the Watch they're related to, apart from different (and really rather nice) rubberised straps that you can't easily buy separately and new watch faces.  Other than that, they don't really offer a lot more other than a stylistic option - and of course they're 'designed' to be use with the Nike app.  So if you're seeing the Nike+ Apple Watch for cheap, make sure it's not the Series 2 model... although that one is perfectly good enough in our eyes, and offers all the advantages minus the LTE connectivity.  Apple Series 1 deals  The best Apple Watch for most non-runners  OS: watchOS 4 | Compatibility: iOS | Display: 1.53\" OLED | Processor: S1P dual-core | Onboard storage: 8GB (only 2GB and 75MB allowed for music and photos, respectively) | Battery: 18 hours | Charging method: Wireless | IP rating: splash-proof | Connectivity: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC  Best Apple Watch for most  Faster than original Watch  Lacks Series 2's bright screen  No GPS and not waterproof  The Apple Watch Series 1 is actually the best Apple Watch for most people who aren\u2019t all-star runners and avid swimmers, with most of the specs you need on a smartwatch.  This is a 'refreshed' Apple Watch compared to the original Apple Watch below, so it has a faster dual-core processor and better battery life as a result.  It runs all the same WatchOS 4 software, which brings some decent improvements and, best of all, the original Watch costs a lot less than the models above.  If you don\u2019t need to track GPS runs and swim with it on, you\u2019ll save money. The discounted Apple Watch Series 1 still comes in two sizes, 38mm and 42mm, but only has the more economical aluminum case and Sport band, although it's still good value despite the limited choice.  Original Apple Watch deals  The iPhone-tailored smartwatch merely a convenient gadget  OS: watchOS 4 | Compatibility: iOS | Display: 1.53\" OLED | Processor: S1 System-in-Package (SiP) | Band sizes: Varies drastically per style | Onboard storage: 8GB (only 2GB and 75MB allowed for music and photos, respectively) | Battery: 18 hours | Charging method: Wireless | IP rating: IPX7 | Connectivity: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC  Can be cheapest model  Slower performance  Battery life is one day  The cheapest Apple Watch on sale today is the original iWatch, the company\u2019s first smartwatch that came out in April 2015.  No, the Apple Store doesn\u2019t sell this price-reduced Apple Watch 1 anymore, but there are plenty of retailers still hawking the original Apple Watch at a discount.  However, we thoroughly recommend that you look at some of the other options unless the cost is really low, as most places aren't selling the first version of the Apple Watch - one that's rather outdated, don't forget - for a good enough price.  Apple Watch band/strap deals  Bands are not one-size-fits-all-budgets  Wide variety of sizes, colors and prices  Incredibly easy to slide onto your Watch  Can't use normal watch straps  Official Apple Watch bands are pricey  Your Apple Watch literally isn\u2019t complete without the best deals on Apple Watch bands. They make the geeky smartwatch stylish enough to show off to late adopters.  In fact, you\u2019re going to want multiple cheap Apple Watch straps simply because more elegant bands are far from ideal for the gym. Vice versa, Sport Bands don\u2019t cut it at the fancy dinner table.  Everyday in the news, we see new cheap Apple Watch bands trying to become the de facto alternative to the more expensive, official Apple Watch bands, and they\u2019re usually just as good. Trust us, buying a trio of third-party, lookalike Apple Watch bands for the price of one official strap is a relief after paying so much for the smartwatch itself. Plus, you'll want to save up for the eventually Apple Watch 3.", "stock": "AAPL", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-14", "source": "techradar", "url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/cheap-apple-watch-deals"}, {"article": "Hopefully you\u2019ve never had to make an emergency SOS call, but if you need to do so there\u2019s a potentially very handy feature built into iOS 11 and the Apple Watch, which makes calling the emergency services quick and easy.  The problem is that it\u2019s sometimes too easy, with The Verge and other outlets reporting that a number of people have accidentally made SOS calls, in some cases resulting in the police arriving unexpectedly.  That\u2019s because all you need to do to place an emergency call from your Apple Watch is hold down the crown button for long enough. Do this and an Emergency SOS slider will appear, but you don\u2019t even need to swipe this, as simply holding the button down for long enough will eventually place the call.  On the iPhone X, iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus it\u2019s a bit trickier to accidentally trigger, but it can still happen, as you simply have to hold down the side button and one of the volume buttons until a slider appears, at which point you can either drag the slider or simply keep holding.  Emergency SOS can almost be too easy to trigger  It\u2019s even less likely to happen on the iPhone 7 or below, as you need to rapidly press the side button five times, then drag the Emergency SOS slider that appears. But in all cases it\u2019s possible to imagine a situation where it could be triggered accidentally.  You can\u2019t totally disable Emergency SOS, which is fair enough since it\u2019s a potentially life-saving feature, but the good news is that you can make it less likely to trigger accidentally. Here\u2019s how.  Disabling Auto Call on the iPhone X, iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus  Disabling Auto Call makes accidental SOS calls less likely  On Apple\u2019s latest handsets you can disable the function that enables the phone to automatically call the emergency services if you simply holding down the side button and a volume button.  To do this, head into the Settings app, then tap Emergency SOS and set the Auto Call toggle to off. Now if you hold down the side button and a volume button the Emergency SOS slider will appear as normal, but you\u2019ll have to swipe it to place the call \u2013 continuing to hold the buttons won\u2019t do it.  On the iPhone 7 or below there\u2019s no setting to change, as by default you have to swipe the slider.  Disabling Auto Call on Apple Watch  Disable Auto Call on Apple Watch so that the crown button isn't all that's between you and a visit from the emergency services  The process is similar on the Apple Watch. Open the Apple Watch app on your iPhone and tap the My Watch tab, then tap General, then Emergency SOS.  From there you\u2019ll see an Auto Call toggle which you can tap to disable. Doing this will mean you\u2019ll have to swipe the Emergency SOS slider when it appears, rather than just continuing to hold the crown button.  Enabling Auto Call  If you change your mind and want to make it as easy as possible to call the emergency services, just repeat the steps above and enable the Auto Call toggle. Then a long press of the relevant buttons will be all you\u2019ll need to reach the emergency services.", "stock": "AAPL", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-19", "source": "techradar", "url": "https://www.techradar.com/how-to/how-to-disable-emergency-sos-on-iphone-and-apple-watch"}, {"article": "Update: A trusted analyst thinks the Apple Watch 4 will come with 15% more display than previous models, more fitness sensors and a larger battery too. We've also seen a leak that suggests Face ID from the iPhone X may be ready for the wrist.  The Apple Watch 3 is the best wearable Apple has built, and, as it tops our best smartwatch list, it\u2019s arguably the best smartwatch from any manufacturer that you can buy right now.  But, like most things in the gadget world, it\u2019s still not perfect or essential in the way that a smartphone is, so naturally it's expected Apple plans to improve it with a Watch 4.  Below we've put together all of the leaks, rumors and speculation about the Apple Watch 4 we've seen so far, plus a list of things we'd like to see Apple implement in its next generation wearable.  Cut to the chase  What is it? The next generation Apple smartwatch  The next generation Apple smartwatch When is it out? Possibly September 2018 alongside new iPhones  Possibly September 2018 alongside new iPhones What will it cost? Probably upwards of \u00a3329 / $329 / AU$459  The Apple Watch 3 in both black and rose gold  Apple announced the third iteration of its smartwatch on September 22, 2017, so we expect we'll have to wait until at least September 2018 to see the launch of the Apple Watch 4.  As the Apple Watch 2 was released a year earlier in September 2016, that\u2019s our best guess - but it's quite likely. We could be waiting even longer though as the gap between the original Apple Watch and the Apple Watch 2 was over a year at 17 months.  There\u2019s no word on the Apple Watch Series 4's price, but it\u2019s likely to be around the same as the Apple Watch 3 currently is, meaning a starting price of around \u00a3329 / $329 / AU$459 for the smaller 38mm version.  That said, the Apple Watch 3 actually had a lower launch price than the Apple Watch 2, so with all the extra tech likely to be found in the Apple Watch 4 the price could equally increase or decrease a little.  Bear in mind that the price we've mentioned above is just the starting cost. If you choose the larger 42mm band or opt for LTE connectivity, the Apple Watch 3 gets more expensive, as does choosing a pricier case or strap material. All of that is likely to remain true for the Apple Watch 4.  Apple Watch 4 design and display  A trusted analyst that has previous history of predicting Apple products suggests the Apple Watch 4 is set to undergo a big design overhaul.  So far every generation of the Apple Watch has come in either 38mm or 42mm screen sizes, but KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says he believes the Apple Watch 4 will have a 15% larger display.  That doesn't necessarily mean the Apple Watch 4 is going to a much bigger watch - the Watch 3 has a lot of bezel space around the outside of the display, so it may be the company has slimmed this down to fit in the extra screen real estate.  That said, Kuo's report does suggest the company will be including a larger battery inside the Apple Watch 4 that will likely mean the body of the watch will have to be at least a touch bigger to squeeze in the larger cell.  Kuo also notes that the design of the Apple Watch 4 is set to be \"more trendy\", but exactly what the analyst means by this isn't particularly clear yet so we'll have to wait for picture leaks to know more about the look.  Before Kuo's comments, we had seen a patent for a self-adjusting watch strap. This would involve a mechanism that expands and contracts the strap as needed, so that the fit remains comfortable and not too loose at all times, which could also help ensure the sensors on the watch get accurate readings.  The Apple Watch 4 could have a strap that resizes itself. Credit: Apple Insider  It's unlikely to happen on the Apple Watch 4, but back in 2016 we also saw a patent filed by the company for a round smartwatch so we may see that in some future generations of the wearable.  Apple Watch 4 features and spec  One leak suggests Apple will use faster, more versatile circuit boards for its antenna. That's again according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo who speculates it'll mean a more stable LTE signal and better heat and moisture resistance.  Rumors for watchOS 5 (learn more about that below) suggest the upgrades to the OS will be using the LTE signal much more regularly, so it makes sense if the company plans to update it to a faster antenna.  One change that we can predict is the chipset, with a new Apple S4 one likely to be included, though we don\u2019t yet know how much difference that will make.  As for new features on the Apple Watch 4, it looks like you may able to unlock your watch by just looking at it. Apple patents show that the Apple Watch 4 may bring a Face ID camera to make the wearable more secure.  That'd mean you'd just be able to look at your watch to unlock it and avoid having to enter an annoying PIN number to be able to use certain functionalities. Additionally, it would make it a whole lot easier to make quick FaceTime calls from your wrist  Apple Watch 4 fitness  One report from late in 2017 suggests the Watch 4 could get an upgraded heart rate tracker that could embrace EKG technology for the first time.  EKGs, also known as ECGs or electrocardiograms, are more advanced than a standard heart rate monitor and provide more in depth information, by using currents of electricity to analyze your heart's behavior.  The rumor comes from Bloomberg (who spoke to people familiar with Apple Watch 4 plans) but the site also spoke to a cardiologist at the University of California who said the feature isn't intended for those who don't experience heart-related issues.  The cardiologist went as far to say if you\u2019re a \"healthy person\", \u201cthere\u2019s no reason to follow ECG\u201d activity.  There's also an older patent for a wearable that can measure your respiration rate, which could well be a feature on the Apple Watch 4, but considering we've yet to see any further leaks about the feature it may be something included on a future wearable like the Watch 5.  You can expect the return of fitness features we've seen on the Apple Watch 3 including the top-end heart rate monitor and GPS technology as well as the ability to track your swimming with the waterproof design.  Apple Watch 4 OS and battery  It\u2019s also likely that the Apple Watch 4 will run watchOS 5, although again we've got very little information on what that will feature.  One report has said the new software will bring something called StreamKit, which would allow for a Spotify app on Apple Watch. That would be a big deal for those who don't use Apple Music.  StreamKit is a framework that's set up behind the scenes to allow cellular versions of the Apple Watch to receive push notifications from apps. That would mean you'd be able to get Facebook or Twitter messages directly to your wrist, and it's another step toward having a fully functioning phone replacement.  Apple Watch 4: what we want to see  While exact details about the Apple Watch 4 remain a mystery for now, the things we want from it aren\u2019t enigmatic at all. In fact, they\u2019re right underneath these words.  1. Android compatibility  If the Apple Watch 4 supported Android it would have wider appeal  We know this is hugely unlikely to happen, but wouldn\u2019t it be great? It would also help the Apple Watch match Android Wear in one of the few areas where it doesn\u2019t already, since Android Wear offers limited compatibility with iOS devices.  It\u2019s understandable that Apple would want to keep its Watch working only with other Apple devices, since doing so keeps people in its ecosystem \u2013 you\u2019re not going to switch to an Android phone if you already have an Apple Watch.  But that could also put off anyone who doesn\u2019t want to make a long-term commitment to Apple, and it completely rules out anyone who currently uses an Android phone from having one of the best smartwatches on the market.  2. Even better battery life  The Apple Watch 3 actually has quite good battery life, at least by smartwatch standards, easily lasting at least two days if you don\u2019t use LTE.  But that still leaves plenty of room for improvement. Many fitness trackers last around a week or longer and of course a conventional watch will go for years.  It\u2019s not realistic to expect the Apple Watch 4 to do the same, but any gains would be appreciated and help make it feel like less of a downgrade from your analog watch in that area.  Improvements could also make sleep tracking more viable, since currently you\u2019re likely to plug your Watch in overnight.  3. More fitness features  The Watch 3 is a good fitness watch, the Apple Watch 4 could be a great one  The Apple Watch has become more and more a health and fitness device over the years and that\u2019s now one of its main selling points, but there\u2019s still room for improvement here.  Much of this will be handled by apps and software updates, but we\u2019d like to see more health and fitness skills from the actual Apple Watch 4 hardware too, such as sensors that can track your respiration rate and blood oxygen levels.  4. Better Siri  One of our few complaints in our Apple Watch 3 review was about the patchiness of Siri. When it works it\u2019s great, but sometimes commands won\u2019t be heard or interpreted properly and that sort of thing can put people off using it at all, since when it does fail you\u2019d usually be quicker doing the thing by hand.  So we\u2019d like Siri on the Apple Watch 4 to work better. That\u2019s probably largely a software or connectivity hurdle, which could mean any improvements will reach older models too.  Another option would be for Apple to improve the microphone so Siri can hear us better, but that's not really the main issue we faced on the Apple Watch 3.  5. Improved performance  Apple upgraded the chipset in the Apple Watch 3 but it\u2019s still not quite as speedy as we\u2019d like, especially when it comes to loading apps, which often isn\u2019t instantaneous.  Much of the time the Apple Watch\u2019s whole purpose is to be a faster, simpler alternative to getting out your phone, but if you\u2019re waiting for apps to load it\u2019s arguably not.  So we hope the chipset in the Apple Watch 4 \u2013 likely to be called the Apple S4 \u2013 will offer the sort of smooth performance we get with an iPhone 8 or iPhone X.  6. A circular option  Not everyone wants a square watch, so we'd like to see a circular option  On the scale of things that are going to happen this ranks way above Android compatibility but below most other things.  Apple seems happy with the design of the Watch and hasn\u2019t substantially changed it in the various versions it\u2019s launched so far, so we don\u2019t expect a redesign any time soon, let alone a completely different screen shape.  But having a circle as an option would be nice. Conventional watches often have a circular face, as do many Android Wear ones, so to appeal to more buyers it would make some sense to offer the choice.  The issue is it would mean reworking the interface a bit, which Apple probably doesn't want to do.  7. Heart rate insights  The heart rate monitor in the Apple Watch 3 is fairly impressive, as it can keep a record of things like your heart rate ranges when working out, your heart rate variability and your daily resting heart rate, as well as your beats per minute, but it doesn\u2019t do much with the information.  It would be good if the Apple Watch 4 \u2013 or a software update on previous models \u2013 added insights into what these stats actually mean and how you can affect them, because that would turn some graphs into genuinely usable information.  Given WatchOS 4 already brings the ability to poke you to be more active at times that are helpful to you, using this heart rate data to help you get fitter (by suggesting slightly longer walks, or congratulating you on lowering your resting heart rate with reasons it's happened) would be excellent.", "stock": "AAPL", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-28", "source": "techradar", "url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/apple-watch-4-release-date"}, {"article": "To celebrate Gudi Padwa, the traditional new year for Marathi Hindus, Apple authorized resellers are offering attractive cashback and no cost EMIs on a wide range of Apple products in the country.

Earlier today we reported that clues along the Apple supply line suggest that the device might ship in February , and this afternoon word dropped that Apple had finally gained approval from the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for the device.  In the official FCC filing, the device is referred to as the \"Apple Inc. Wireless Speaker,\" with a code name of A1639. Accompanying product diagrams almost certainly confirm that it's the same device that we've seen discussed since June of last year.  The approval clears the way for Apple to start selling the device on US shelves, and FCC approvals are often considered a reliable indicator that a new Apple product will be heading our way soon. (In some cases, though, as with product A1844 , the approved device turns out to be something as mundane as a door lock that was intended for Apple's new campus.)  As MacRumors notes, for instance, the iPhone X secured FCC approval on October 4 and was available to the public beginning November 3.

Other complications that prevent the HomePod from releasing in a timely manner could also still be on the horizon, of course.

A DisplayLink product manager responded to complaints on its own support forums , confirming that macOS 10.13.4 is to blame for the error, and that it\u2019s working on a fix. This update specifically renders the display capabilities of its docks inert, while other functions remain unaffected.  \u201cIn the meantime, we are releasing a new driver [4.3] that will enable clone mode, but not mirror or extended mode displays in 10.13.4,\u201d the product manager writes. \u201cIf you require mirror or extended mode displays, we recommend that you stay on macOS 10.13.3 at this time.\u201d  iPad extended displays aren\u2019t working either  Meanwhile, Duet Display \u2013 a $19.99 (\u00a39.99) Mac App store program that, for another 20 bucks a month, can act as your Mac\u2019s second display via Lightning cable \u2013 isn\u2019t working either. Following the macOS 10.13.4 update, the Duet client app hangs without starting.  Duet Display developer Duet Inc. is advising its customers to refrain from upgrading to the latest macOS so as to avoid the issue, according to MacRumors , as well as contact Apple directly through its bug reporting features.  Worse off is that desktop extension apps, like Air Display and iDisplay, are also reportedly experiencing related issues, also according to MacRumors. The website also cites speculation in said discussions around these issues that Apple\u2019s eGPU support in the operating system update is to blame.  As far as we can tell, it doesn't seem like macOS 10.13.4 has affected external display connected directly to MacBooks through mini DisplayPort or Thunderbolt.

There was a clock, for example, and if you were lucky you might have even be told what temperature it was outside.  But as smartphone technology improved, drivers quickly demanded more from their vehicles. After all, why should the phone in your pocket have a better screen and more responsive user interface than the one in your car, which cost considerably more?  To their credit, car manufacturers are faced with five, or even 10-year product cycles, so no matter how advanced their infotainment system looks at launch, it is bound to look dated well before the car gets its first facelift.  That\u2019s where Apple CarPlay comes in. Powered by your iPhone, CarPlay gives your car an interface which looks like iOS, but is simplified so it can be safely and legally used while driving.  Are you Android rather than iPhone? Then you'll need Android Auto  What is CarPlay?  In simple terms, CarPlay takes the user interface of your iPhone and puts it onto the infotainment screen of your car dashboard.  This means when your iPhone is plugged in, the car\u2019s own system is replaced by the iOS home screen, complete with app icons and a virtual home button.  CarPlay can be interacted with via whatever controls your car already has, whether that be a touch screen, buttons, knobs, voice or a combination of all of these.  CarPlay doesn\u2019t include every app on your smartphone, because playing PUBG on your car dashboard is clearly a disaster waiting to happen, and some elements of apps are replaced by voice and dictation.  For example, incoming iMessages and WhatsApp messages are read out to you by Siri instead of shown on the display.  The 2017 Hyundai Elantra supports CarPlay for under $20,000  Most cars require you to plug your iPhone into the USB port with a Lightning cable, but some newer models (like the latest BMW 5-Series) now support wireless CarPlay, which works via the car\u2019s Bluetooth connection.  This is more convenient, but you\u2019ll want to make sure your iPhone is sat on a wireless charger if using wireless CarPlay, as it can drain the battery quickly if you\u2019re streaming music over 4G and using the Maps app for navigation.  CarPlay is designed to remove the urge to take a quick look at your iPhone behind the wheel. It\u2019s safer, easier and more convenient - or that\u2019s the idea, anyway.  Which cars support Apple CarPlay?  As of March 2018, there are over 300 models of car with CarPlay available either standard or as a paid-for optional extra.  Some cars bundle CarPlay when you opt for the enhanced sound system, for example, or pick a higher level of cabin trim level.  Other manufacturers charge a premium for adding CarPlay on its own, and the price can vary significantly.  For example, Honda includes CarPlay as standard on some models, and Ford includes CarPlay with its \u00a3750 (around $1,000) Sync 3 system in the new Fiesta (along with a larger touch screen and six speakers).  At the other end of the scale, Ferrari charges a huge \u00a32,400 (around $3,000) for adding the software necessary to make it work.  We have included a list of manufacturers currently offering CarPlay at the end of this article. Although it doesn\u2019t include everyone just yet, you\u2019ll be doing well to name a car maker off the top of your head that doesn\u2019t offer CarPlay  Apple CarPlay aftermarket solutions?  If you\u2019re not in the market for a new car, you can still get some CarPlay in your life by installing an aftermarket stereo.  Manufacturers like Alpine, Clarion, JBL, JVC, Kenwood, Pioneer and Sony all sell car stereo systems with CarPlay, as well as other goodies like Android Auto, Bluetooth and DAB digital radio.  The JBL Legend CP100 with Apple CarPlay  Prices start at around \u00a3200 ($280, AU$360) for an entry-level unit from a company like Power Acoustik, and go beyond \u00a3500 ($700, AU$900) for a fold-out system from Pioneer.  What you need to know about these systems is that car stereos come in two sizes; single DIN and double DIN. Single DIN units are usually two inches tall, while double DIN means a system which is four inches tall.  The former, like the Pioneer AVH-Z7000DAB we referred to above, is a single DIN unit with a motorised screen which folds out of your dashboard. Modern cars with their curved dashboards tend to not cater for aftermarket stereos like these without modification to the dashboard - something which is generally not advisable.  Is my iPhone compatible with CarPlay?  If you\u2019re still rocking an old iPhone with a 30-pin connector, then you\u2019re out of luck; any model before the iPhone 5 does not work with CarPlay. No model of iPad or iPod Touch work with CarPlay.  But it also means a lot of iPhones do - and here they are:  iPhone 5  iPhone 5S  iPhone 5C  iPhone SE  iPhone 6  iPhone 6 Plus  iPhone 6S  iPhone 6S Plus  iPhone 7  iPhone 7 Plus  iPhone 8  iPhone 8 Plus  iPhone X  What does CarPlay look like?  CarPlay is designed to look a lot like iOS. Sure, the home screen background is made black and most of your apps are hidden from view, but CarPlay is still the bare bones of your iPhone.  The main screen shows a selection of apps like Phone, Music, Maps and Messages, along with the time, your phone\u2019s signal strength, and a virtual home button.  As you open and close apps, the most recent three appear at the side of the user interface nearest the steering wheel, making it easy to return to the map, for example, without taking your eyes off the road for more than a quick glance.  That really is the point of CarPlay; it offers access to your iPhone\u2019s core features without distracting you from driving.  That\u2019s why most apps are hidden, and why many employ Siri to read things out rather than letting you read them off the screen.  For example, open the Messages app and you\u2019ll see a list of the most recent people to chat with you, but when you tap on a name Siri reads out any unread messages, or asks if you\u2019d like to dictate a reply.  Notifications appear at the top of the screen as they do on your iPhone, but these are limited to apps which can be used by CarPlay. If your phone receives a breaking news alert from the BBC, for example, it won\u2019t show up.  CarPlay also employs several tricks to make you spend less time looking at it. If you scroll through the artists list in your Music app, the interface will start showing large letters instead of every artist. Scroll until you get to the right letter, then pick the artist you want.  The home screen also shows an app to tap on if you want to return to the car\u2019s own infotainment system.  To adjust the layout of apps on CarPlay you have to head into the Settings app on your iPhone itself (when it isn\u2019t connected to the car).  Tap General, then CarPlay, then the car you want to change the home page of, and move the apps around as you would on the home screen of the phone itself.  Third-party apps compatible with CarPlay:  WhatsApp  Spotify  Amazon Music  Google Play Music  iPlayer Radio  CBS Radio  Pandora  Slacker Radio  Tidal  Audible  NPR One  VOX  Clammr  Downcast  While this should cater for most people\u2019s music and messaging needs, mapping is an area where CarPlay could be vastly improved. Only Apple Maps works, so you won\u2019t be able to access Google Maps or Waze while on the move.

Aside from a handful of analyst estimates, we don't know how many iPhone Xs Apple has sold. The company doesn't break out sales by iPhone model, though we'll learn more about iPhone sales overall in its earnings report next week. The general consensus is that the X sales, while not terrible, fell short of expectations. Let's put these sales forecasts aside -- what's done is done. If Apple does discontinue the existing iPhone X (which seems more than possible), it'll have more to do with future sales than past ones.  Kuo -- who is often hailed as the Best Apple Analyst, Period -- has been saying for months now that Apple will overhaul its iPhone lineup in 2018 with a trio of iPhone X-like devices, complete with expansive screens and those telltale notches for Face ID. At the high end, Kuo predicts Apple will release a sort of iPhone X Plus, with a 6.5-inch OLED screen and a stainless steel body. The low end should be well tended by a new X-like iPhone with a cheaper 6.1-inch LCD screen, a single camera and (in a bizarre twist) no pressure-sensing 3D Touch display. Meanwhile, right in the middle of the pack sits a 5.8-inch, stainless steel-clad iPhone X sequel.  But here's the thing: According to a more recent research note Kuo dropped, that hypothetical low-end iPhone is expected to sell for between $750 and $800 without a contract. Considering that Apple usually keeps selling existing iPhones at reduced prices after new models have launched, it's not hard to see how a discounted iPhone X could eat into sales of Apple's new LCD model. That simply can't happen.  Based on what little we know about the the 6.1-inch iPhone, it's a little less ambitious in every way (save for perhaps its size). That logically means it's cheaper to make, and it's no stretch to imagine that Apple would see bigger margins off those things. Given the choice between making some money off each original iPhone X sold and potentially making more money off a cheap, big X sequel, treating the current model like a sacrificial lamb doesn't seem like a huge stretch. And having a big, relatively inexpensive iPhone with an edge-to-edge screen could be a huge help for Apple in China, where the company is facing intense pressure from homegrown rivals that have proved themselves capable of building high-powered smartphones with budget price tags.  Oh, and let's not forget that Apple just does this sometimes. When it was time to build a sequel for the iPhone 5, the company built the 5s and replaced the existing iPhone 5 with the plastic-fantastic iPhone 5c. People were going to buy a low-cost iPhone that year anyway, and while no one really loved the 5c, the idea still has merit, assuming the hardware is done well.  So yes, the iPhone X will be dead in that you (probably) won't be able to buy last year's model once the sequels arrive. That's the whole point: Regardless of whether it sold as fast or as well as Apple hoped it would, the iPhone X did its job. It showed people what the iPhone could be. Whether Apple's strategy ultimately succeeds remains to be seen, but if it does, putting the first iPhone X to rest is a small price to pay.", "stock": "AAPL", "label": -1, "date": "2018-01-23", "source": "engadget", "url": "https://www.engadget.com/2018/01/23/apple-isnt-killing-the-iphone-x/"}, {"article": "Among the companies with shares expected to trade actively in Tuesday\u2019s session are Citigroup, General Electric, UnitedHealth Group Inc., Apple, Alphabet and Amazon.com.  Citigroup shares climbed 2% before the opening bell following the bank\u2019s latest earnings report. Citigroup said that it lost $18.3 billion in the fourth quarter, its earnings wiped out by a $22 billion charge related to the new tax law, though revenue rose from a year earlier. Without the tax charge, the bank would have topped profit expectations.  Shares of General Electric shed 3.6% premarket. The industrial conglomerate said it expects a $6.2 billion after-tax charge in its fourth quarter after reviewing GE Capital\u2019s runoff insurance portfolio. CEO John Flannery also said the firm will examine separately traded units for its major businesses.  UnitedHealth shares rose 2.2% premarket after the health insurer\u2019s quarterly profit beat analysts\u2019 expectations and the firm raised its yearly outlook, as revenue from both its health care and health care services businesses increased.  Shares of Apple added 0.7% premarket following the news that the iPhone maker and Chinese tech giant Tencent have settled their tiff over tips, allowing users of Tencent\u2019s popular WeChat messaging app to resume giving monetary gifts to their favorite video-streaming stars and content creators.  Alphabet, the parent company of search-engine giant Google, rose 0.7% before the opening bell. Google said it is expanding its sprawling network of undersea cables to plug into new regions around the world, in a bid to speed up its cloud-computing business and catch up to rivals Microsoft and Amazon.com.  Amazon shares were up 1.1% premarket. Data was released showing products carrying the Whole Foods brand helped push sales at Amazon\u2019s online grocery-delivery service, AmazonFresh, up 35% to $135 million in the last four months of 2017 over the previous four months.  Shares of Ford Motor climbed 0.5% premarket after an executive said the auto maker will now spend $11 billion on electrified vehicles through 2022, increasing its previous estimates as it races to catch up on battery-powered cars.  Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. shares advanced 0.8% premarket. CEO Sergio Marchionne said he has no plans to sell its Jeep business or split up the company, cooling speculation but leaving the company\u2019s long-term strategy unclear. Late Friday, the firm issued a recall for more than 162,000 late model Chrysler Pacifica minivans to fix a software flaw that could stall out vehicles while being driven.  Shares of another auto maker, General Motors, also rose and were up 3.4%. The company said it will take a $7 billion non-cash charge following recent tax changes and said excluding the charge, it expects 2017 profits to come in at the high end of its guidance.  Shares of Spectrum Brands Holdings climbed 1.2% before the opening bell. Energizer Holdings Inc. said it will buy the firm\u2019s battery and portable lighting business for $2 billion in cash. Spectrum\u2019s battery portfolio includes Varta and Rayovac brands and generated $866 million in revenue last year. Energizer shares rose 12%.  Merck & Co Inc. shares surged 5.1% premarket after the drug company announced positive late-stage trial results for a lung cancer treatment.  Shares of Blackhawk Network Holdings added 24% premarket to $45.10 following the news that Silver Lake and P2 Capital Partners have agreed to acquire the financial technology firm for approximately $3.5 billion, including debt. The deal values Blackhawk at $45.25 a share, a roughly 24% premium over Friday\u2019s closing price.  Viacom shares declined 3% premarket.

Shares of MetLife tumbled 7.4% before the opening bell after the nation\u2019s second-largest life insurer by assets disclosed for the first time the scale of a records mistake that left possibly tens of thousands of workers without their monthly pension benefits. The company said it expects to increase its reserves by $525 million to $575 million on a pretax basis to account for the problem.  Amazon.com, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase said the firms are partnering on a new company to figure out how to reduce health-care costs for their hundreds of thousands of U.S. employees. Amazon was up 0.4% premarket, while Berkshire was down 0.2% and JPMorgan was up less than 0.1%.  Aetna shares fell 2.6% premarket following the insurer\u2019s quarterly sales and profit beats, though revenue dropped 5.6% in the most recent quarter from a year earlier. Other insurers were also down following the announcement from Amazon, Berkshire and JPMorgan. UnitedHealth Group, Anthem and Cigna all dropped at least 5%.  Shares of Wal-Mart were down 1.4% before the opening bell following a Journal report that the retail giant plans to ask suppliers to deliver more goods to warehouses exactly on time or face fines, another step in its efforts to keep inventory low and shelves stocked as it battles with Amazon.  McDonald's shares declined 0.3% premarket. The fast-food giant posted quarterly sales and profits that beat analyst expectations.

Apple Inc. said it is acquiring Texture, a digital-magazine-subscription service. Photo: Yui Mok/Zuma Press  Apple Inc. AAPL 0.34% said it will acquire Next Issue Media LLC and its digital-magazine-subscription service Texture, a product developed by top magazine companies that bundles together some 200 subscriptions into one monthly service.  The acquisition comes as Apple looks to beef up its services business, which includes music streaming and mobile payments.  Apple has set a goal of increasing total revenue from services to more than $40 billion by 2020. The company generated nearly $30 billion in services revenue in its fiscal year ended in September.  Apple typically takes a 15% cut of subscription services from publishers and content providers, including Netflix Inc. and HBO, if those subscriptions are purchased through the App Store.  Terms of the deal weren\u2019t disclosed. Next Issue Media and Texture are owned by Cond\u00e9 Nast, Meredith Corp. , Hearst Corp., Rogers Communications Inc. and KKR & Co.  The magazine industry for years has sought ways to transition from print to online, but has faced profound challenges competing with tech giants for digital ad dollars, while print ad revenue continues to decline.  Last year, Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and Facebook Inc. accounted for more than 63% of U.S. digital ad spending, according to eMarketer, while the magazine world has been buffeted by steady cutbacks and numerous rounds of consolidation.  Next Issue, which launched in 2009, was envisioned as a way for publishers to compete against tech titans like Apple, whose app store has come to dominate distribution in the digital publishing marketplace.  In a joint statement, Texture\u2019s key publishing investors said the sale was in line with the shifting marketplace the industry has faced.  \u201cThis new relationship with Apple not only will deliver new audiences and further the reach of our collective brands, but reflects the way consumers are engaging with media today as they look to discover content and subscribe with more convenience and ease,\u201d they said.  Texture, which offers a monthly, $10 subscription to magazines such as Vanity Fair, Good Housekeeping, Time, Sports Illustrated, and National Geographic, fits into Apple\u2019s effort to bring news and information to iPhone and iPad users. The company launched Apple News in 2015 and has been aggregating and providing news stories to iPhone users since then.  \u201cWe are committed to quality journalism from trusted sources and allowing magazines to keep producing beautifully designed and engaging stories for users,\u201d said Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s senior vice president who oversees the services business.

Or at least that\u2019s been the case recently. The largest U.S.-listed company by market capitalization has risen for five straight sessions, including a 3.4% jump on Thursday after regulatory filings showed Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway raised its stake in the iPhone maker last quarter.  That took Apple\u2019s price to $172.99, up nearly 12% from its recent low and pulling it out of correction territory.  The S&P 500 is similarly up for five straight sessions, marking its largest five-day percentage gain since December of 2011, according to The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Market Data Group. The index is up 5.8% from its 2018 closing low from Feb. 8, as our Morning MoneyBeat newsletter noted on Friday.  Apple and its tech-giant peers are still a leading force in the stock market, even after driving gains for most of the nearly nine-year-old bull market and especially the last year. For those trying to discern where stocks head next in an uncertain market, Apple\u2019s stock is as good a place to look as any.  Apple dropped more than 13% during the worst of the recent selloff. The company had a particularly bad session in early February, dropping 4.3% the day after an earnings report that showed the company sold fewer iPhones and projected weaker-than-expected revenue for the current quarter. Both Apple and the S&P 500 pointed slightly lower in premarket trade Friday.  The selloff proved to be short-lived. Wall Street analysts, bullish group that they are, still expect Apple\u2019s stock to keep gaining. Among the 39 whose price targets are tracked by FactSet, analysts project on average gain of 11% over the next year to a price of $192.06. The recent selloff only caused them to lower targets slightly from $193.03 at the end of last month.  Apple hasn\u2019t been pushing the market higher on its own, of course. Ten of the 11 sectors in the S&P 500 were in the green on Thursday. But the technology sector was the S&P 500\u2032s second-best performing on Thursday. What\u2019s more, it has had the second-best performance so far this year, up 5.7%.  A key driver of the sector is Apple, whose $878 billion market cap gives it a 3.5% weighting in the S&P 500, according to FactSet. That means it has more push and pull on the index than any other single company.

An iPhone X is seen on a large video screen in the new Apple Visitor Center in Cupertino, Calif., in November. Photo: elijah nouvelage/Reuters  Apple Inc. AAPL 0.34% is being investigated by the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission over potential securities violations related to the company\u2019s disclosure of a software update that slowed older iPhones, people familiar with the matter said.  The two probes add pressure on the tech giant to address criticism from customers and lawmakers after it acknowledged in December that it was throttling the performance of older iPhones as batteries aged. The company later apologized for the issue and slashed the price of an iPhone battery replacement to $29 from $79, hoping to win back customer goodwill.  Apple acknowledged in a statement that it is responding to questions from some government agencies, though it declined to disclose which agencies or any details regarding the questions. It also reiterated what it said in December, noting that it has \u201cnever\u2014and would never\u2014do anything to intentionally shorten the life of any Apple product, or degrade the user experience to drive customer upgrades.\u201d  The news of the investigations was reported earlier by Bloomberg.  Regulators and prosecutors often open investigations that don\u2019t result in any charges being filed, and securities investigations often take more than a year. It isn\u2019t clear why federal officials are focusing on potential securities violations involving an issue affecting customers.  Generally in such a case, the SEC could try to fault a public company for failing to make timely disclosures about material information that would affect the stock price. The company\u2019s potential liability would probably turn on whether the fallout from poor battery performance was likely to be material and whether the company delayed disclosing it or had the proper systems to detect and account for it.  Apple\u2019s stock has fallen about 4% since Apple\u2019s acknowledgment, but much of the losses have occurred in the past week ahead of Thursday\u2019s planned quarterly earnings report. Some of the declines have come amid reports of possible weaker-than-expected demand for the iPhone X. On Tuesday, Apple\u2019s shares fell 0.6% to $166.97.  Still, some analysts have said the battery issues could hit Apple\u2019s financials. Barclays said in a note this month that Apple could sell 16 million fewer iPhones this year, and lose $10.29 billion in revenue, directly related to customers choosing to replace batteries rather than replace their iPhones.  Apple last week announced it will release a spring software update with a feature that shows an iPhone battery\u2019s health and recommends when it needs to be serviced. Customers also will be able to see if the power-throttling feature is being used on their device and switch it off.  During an interview with ABC News earlier this month, Chief Executive Tim Cook said last year\u2019s update was designed to prevent users from having their phone power off during a call or while taking a photograph. He said Apple made the change to improve customers\u2019 experience and that Apple disclosed the feature at the time, though, he said people may not have been paying attention.  \u201cMaybe we should have been clearer, as well,\u201d Mr. Cook said. \u201cWe deeply apologize to anybody that thinks we had some other kind of motivation because our motivation is always the user.\u201d  Since acknowledging it throttled iPhone performance, the company has faced questions from consumer and watchdog groups in France, Italy and China. In France, the Paris prosecutor\u2019s office said early this month it opened an investigation into Apple for potential deception and \u201cprogrammed obsolescence.\u201d The investigation could lead to preliminary charges or be dropped.  Earlier this month, U.S. Sen. John Thune (R., S.D.), chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, sent Mr. Cook a letter seeking more information on how the company tracked customer complaints of processing performance and whether or not it considered offering rebates to customers who had replaced their batteries at a higher price.  Apple hasn\u2019t commented on the French investigation or Mr. Thune\u2019s letter.  Battery life and processing speeds are two of the most important features on smartphones. To prevent iPhone 6, 6s and SE devices from powering off automatically\u2014something that drew complaints last year from Chinese consumer-protection groups\u2014Apple said it updated its operating system, iOS, to slow certain tasks that required more computing power than a device could provide. It expanded the practice to the iPhone 7 in the fall.  The Apple investigations add to a mounting list of clashes between the Trump administration and tech firms over the past year, including a rollback of internet regulations that Silicon Valley had championed during the Obama era. Tech firms also have run into political trouble lately in Congress, particularly over alleged Russian online meddling in the 2016 election, but also user privacy concerns and liability for online sex trafficking.  \u2014John McKinnon contributed to this article.

Apple launched the expensive device later than usual during its fiscal first quarter that ended Dec. 30. The phone came on the 10th anniversary of the company\u2019s first smartphone, and was heralded by Apple and its fans as the \u201cfuture of smartphones.\u201d But an opening price of $1,000 is rich for any smartphone, and production issues appeared to keep supply of the phone relatively tight at least in the first few weeks after its early November launch.  That appeared to weigh down sales. Apple said Thursday that it sold a total of 77.3 million iPhones during the quarter, which was below the 80 million units analysts had been expecting. That made for a 1% year-over-year decline in iPhone unit sales for the quarter, though iPhone revenue popped by 13% to hit $61.6 billion. That is a signal that the iPhone X appealed to enough of the company\u2019s fan base to boost iPhone\u2019s average selling price to about $796\u2014the highest on record and a strong 15% jump from the same period last year.  That still isn\u2019t the \u201csupercycle\u201d that many investors have been expecting. And Apple\u2019s outlook for the fiscal second quarter ending in March suggests more of the same. The company projected total revenue in the range of $60 billion to $62 billion for the quarter, which would make for a year-over-year gain of 15%. Despite reports that Apple is cutting iPhone production this quarter due to weaker sales, Wall Street still had been expecting overall revenue to rise 24% in the quarter.  Apple\u2019s share price had slipped about 6% over the past two weeks, so the disappointing projection was somewhat priced in. And the company is still immensely profitable, with operating income jumping 12% year over year to a record $26.3 billion.  Any concerns about cyclical iPhone sales were somewhat soothed by Apple\u2019s service-arm revenue, which had another period of double-digit growth during the quarter. Services comprised nearly 13% of Apple\u2019s trailing 12-month revenue compared with 9% two years ago.

The tech giant, in announcing the sales date Tuesday, didn\u2019t explain why the product missed a promised December ship date. The HomePod can be preordered online beginning Friday.  Market leaders Amazon.com Inc. AMZN -1.22% and Alphabet Inc. GOOGL -0.12% continued to sell Echo and Google Home devices during the holidays, while Apple worked on a rival product it said wasn\u2019t ready for sale.  Amazon was the first major tech company to enter the smart-speaker market in late 2014, opening a wide lead by selling more than 20 million Echos even before tallying sales for the recent Christmas season. Its hockey puck-sized Echo Dot is estimated to account for more than half of Amazon\u2019s speaker unit sales, largely because of its lower price, which dropped to $30 during the holidays before rising to $50.  The smart-speaker shipments world-wide are expected to rise more than 50% this year to 56 million units, according to the market researcher Canalys. The U.S. will account for more than half of those sales, it said.  At $349, the HomePod costs considerably more than Amazon\u2019s latest Echo and a Google Home, whose list prices are $100 and $129, respectively.  Apple has tried to differentiate its speaker by emphasizing sound quality, particularly when playing music, over the device\u2019s ability to perform tasks.  Voice-activated speakers have moved to the forefront in a battle over what some technology analysts see as the future of computing. Virtual assistants such as Apple\u2019s Siri, Amazon\u2019s Alexa, Microsoft Corp.\u2019s Cortana and Google Assistant are expected to be embedded in more than 4 billion consumer devices by the end of 2018, allowing people to perform simple computing tasks by voice such as searching for information or turning off lights, according to the research firm IHS Markit.  From the Archives In a 2.5-hour keynote, Apple announced a slew of new hardware and software products. WSJ's Joanna Stern recaps what you need to know about the most important announcements (Originally published Sept. 8, 2017) .  Apple\u2019s Siri has a much wider presence by virtue of being featured on more than a billion iPhones and iPads. However, Amazon and Google are aiming to catch up by cutting deals to put their assistants into such products as Toyota Motor Corp. vehicles and Sony Corp. televisions. They also offer greater functionality; Amazon\u2019s Alexa, for example, can perform thousands of commands compared with hundreds by Siri.  The HomePod was the latest in a series of Apple products that faced delayed. The AirPods earbuds missed their promised ship date last year, and the Apple Watch, promised in early 2015, arrived late in April of that year.

Photo: Scott Olson/Getty Images  The launch of Apple Inc.\u2019s AAPL 0.34% new iPad in a Chicago high school is both an effort to better serve students and one to fend off Google, which has caught up and passed the once-dominant player in the education market.  Apple CEO Tim Cook gathered media in Chicago to lay out its newest efforts geared toward the education market. They include a new suite of software services along with an updated iPad. The new tablet adds the company\u2019s latest mobile processor with some other upgrades for the same price as its predecessor. That includes a 9% price discount for schools.  Apple last updated its iPad lineup a year ago, culling some offerings while trimming the price on its flagship 9.7-inch version. That didn\u2019t arrest a long-running decline in sales for the pioneering tablet. iPad unit sales fell 4% in the fiscal year ended September, and Wall Street expects another 6% decline for the current year. But Tuesday\u2019s announcement wasn\u2019t simply Apple trying to bolster what is now its fourth-largest business, behind the iPhone, services and Mac in terms of annual revenue.

Watch the full documentary at wsj.com/docs. (Originally Published June 28, 2017) Altering that trajectory will be a major challenge, even for the world\u2019s most valuable company. Google, owned by Alphabet Inc., GOOGL -0.12% has the advantage of both price and ubiquity. The cheapest Chromebooks are about 40% less than the cheapest iPad, and Google\u2019s G-Suite of services is already widespread in schools. Gmail alone passed the 1-billion-user mark two years ago. Apple\u2019s software often gets high marks. But the company\u2019s software and services only work on its own equipment. That means the company\u2019s prospects are always closely tied to its ability to sell devices. And since those devices still drive the majority of Apple\u2019s operating profits, the company can\u2019t really afford to compete on price. Google, which doesn\u2019t even make most of the Chromebooks bearing its operating system, has no such limitations. Apple\u2019s approach has served it well overall. But in budget-constrained markets like education, the right price isn\u2019t always one the company can meet.

AAPL 0.34% is scheduled to report results for its fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 30, after the market closes Thursday. Here\u2019s what you need to know.  EARNINGS FORECAST: Earnings of $3.86 a share is the consensus of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters, compared with $3.36 a share a year ago. The company hasn\u2019t provided earnings guidance for the quarter but in November said it expects gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5% in the quarter.  REVENUE FORECAST: Revenue of $87.06 billion is expected by analysts, compared with $78.4 billion reported a year earlier. In November, Apple said it expected revenue to be between $84 billion and $87 billion in the quarter.  Dollars & Cents: Apple raised prices last year in a move that has the potential to boost overall revenue even as the number of iPhones it sells stagnates. Analysts believe the strategy paid off in December. Apple is projected to report a 1.5% increase in iPhone shipments, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet, but the $1,000 iPhone X, released on Nov. 3, is expected to lift the average selling price of the device 9% to $755. Those higher prices are expected to lift iPhone revenue 10% to $60 billion in the period. Meanwhile, Apple kept more old iPhone models on the market in December, a move that market research firm Strategy Analytics predicts helped the company increase iPhone shipments 22% in China.  Taxman: Apple in mid-January announced it would pay $38 billion in taxes on the $252 billion it holds overseas, but it hasn\u2019t said how much of that money it will bring back to the U.S. or outlined what will be returned to shareholders through buybacks or dividends. The company typically announces capital return plans in April or May and may hold off discussing it until then. But expect analysts to ask for more clarity on Apple\u2019s plans now that it no longer needs to hold cash overseas to avoid paying higher U.S. taxes. Also, look for the company to update its new effective tax rate. Morgan Stanley expects Apple to benefit from a lower tax rate of approximately 15.9% due to tax reform, adding $1.13 to its current fiscal-year earnings per share  Promised Land: Analysts and investors will zero in on Apple\u2019s revenue projections for the March quarter. With the iPhone X contributing less than two months of sales during the last quarter, many analysts had banked on strong sales in the current period because of pent up demand. Some have scuttled those projections recently amid reports that iPhone manufacturing has slowed. Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein reduced his projections for the current quarter to 53 million units from 66 million and warned the earnings call could trigger downward earnings estimates for the period. Analysts currently project revenue for the March quarter of $66.54 billion, according to FactSet.  The Great Divide: Apple doesn\u2019t break out its mix of iPhone sales by model, forcing analysts and investors to come up with their own estimates. One of the key indicators of demand is channel inventory. Apple tries to keep inventory in the five- to seven-week range. UBS analyst Steve Milunovich said that if the iPhone X is a disappointment relative to Apple\u2019s expectations, then the company\u2019s inventory levels could be higher. During its last earnings call for the quarter ended Sept. 30, the company indicated it expected healthy demand for the iPhone X by saying it increased inventory by 1.3 million smartphone units to support the iPhone 8 launch, 50% less than the 2.5 million it added during the release of the iPhone 7 in the same period a year earlier.  Trouble No More: The company\u2019s business in China is showing signs of improvement. Sales rose in the September quarter from a year earlier, marking the first quarterly gain in more than a year. Analysts expect this quarter to deliver another increase with sales projected to rise 9.2% to $17.73 billion, according to FactSet. The growth is expected to be driven by improved iPhone sales in that market and the continued strength of App Store sales.", "stock": "AAPL", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-01", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-expected-to-report-higher-prices-drove-record-quarterly-revenue-1517482800"}, {"article": "The Chicago landlord of what Apple Inc. calls its \u201cmost ambitious store\u201d has put the building on the block in a sales process that will test the power of the popular brand name in a tempestuous retail climate.  Real-estate private equity firm Walton Street Capital has hired Eastdil Secured to market the Norman Foster-designed Apple Store that opened last fall and has become a popular new attraction along the reinvigorated Chicago River waterfront.  Walton last year paid $370 million for the Apple Store, which at the time was under development, along with 401 N. Michigan Ave., the 35-story office and retail building next door.  Now the firm is hoping to sell the 20,000-square-foot Apple Store along with 10,000-square-feet of retail space in the office building for as much as $175 million, according to people familiar with the offering.  Walton would retain the office space. Real-estate investors often buy mixed-use properties and then split off the valuable retail space and sell it separately.  Eastdil and potential buyers of the Apple Store were having preliminary discussions last week at the global Mipim real estate conference in Cannes, France, according to people at the conference. Eric Mogentale, managing principal of Walton, declined comment.  The sale comes at a time when retail real-estate in general is under enormous pressure because of competition from online shopping and the contraction and failure of many big name retailers. Values of many malls and shopping centers have been falling.  Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s CEO, attended the store opening. Photo: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg News  But Apple Stores have long been the gold standard in the retail world because of the high traffic they attract. Not only do they ring up strong sales, but they also boost traffic and sales at neighboring stores.  A report by Green Street Advisors in 2016 found that average sales for 220 malls with Apple Stores came to $710 per square foot, compared with $630 per square foot for malls without Apple Stores. The study was based on a database that covered about 1,400 properties.  Apple is well aware of the power of its brand and uses it to negotiate low rents. The rent it is paying for the new Apple Store in Chicago is well below the average $400 to $500 per square foot being paid nearby along Michigan Avenue, in an upscale retail area known as the Magnificent Mile, said people familiar with the matter.  Apple began discussing the new Chicago store more than two years ago with Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who has made development of the Chicago River waterfront a big priority. More than $60 million was spent on the standalone store, which has a 32-foot-tall glass fa\u00e7ade and a thin carbon roof.  The project included the redevelopment of the surrounding plaza area so that now Michigan Avenue is linked to the riverfront by granite staircases on either side of the store. The plaza, once cut off from the water, now \u201cflows effortlessly down to the river,\u201d Jony Ive, Apple\u2019s chief design officer, said when the store opened.  The store opened in October in a ceremony attended by Mr. Emanuel and Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook.  Apple officials describe the store as the company\u2019s most ambitious partly because of its design and its connection to the river. The store is also bringing in well-known professionals to teach Apple device users about the products, an experience that isn\u2019t available at most other Apple stores around the world.

Apple on Wednesday said an update to its operating system for iPhones and iPads this spring will include a new \u201cHealth Records\u201d feature that will import and store medical information covering allergies, conditions, immunizations, lab results, medications, procedures and vitals.  A dozen hospitals are participating, including Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore, Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles and Penn Medicine in Philadelphia.  The effort to securely simplify and democratize health records won\u2019t be easy, say physicians who watched Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google wrestle with similar efforts over the years.  Apple\u2019s late arrival to medical records, though, gives it advantages its rivals didn\u2019t enjoy, physicians say, including the benefits of more consolidated hospital networks and concentration among medical-record systems.  \u201cApple is in the right spot,\u201d said Eric Topol, author of \u201cThe Creative Destruction of Medicine\u201d and a physician at the nonprofit Scripps Research Institute. \u201cThere\u2019s a long ways to go still,\u201d he said.  Starting in 2011, the U.S. government spent an estimated $40 billion in stimulus money on health-care information technology, according to McKinsey, encouraging doctors and hospitals to install electronic-medical-records systems and triggering a massive shift toward electronic health information.  Apple said it has secured participation from two of the U.S.\u2019s largest medical-records providers, Epic Systems Corp. and Cerner Corp., which account for more than 50% of medical-records management, as well as Athenahealth Inc., ATHN -1.51% which accounts for almost 2%, according to KLAS Research, which analyzes the industry.  But Apple needs to get more hospitals to share data in order for the Health Records feature to be valuable, said Noga Leviner, co-founder of PicnicHealth, a startup that helps patients consolidate their medical records.  Some hospitals in the same system use different variations of electronic medical records\u2014even from the same provider\u2014and oftentimes don\u2019t have agreements to share data, Ms. Leviner said. People want complete medical-records information\u2014not just records from only one of their six doctors, she said.  \u201cThe government spent $40 billion on this and they failed\u201d to bring those hospitals together, Ms. Leviner said.  Another challenge: expanding information beyond simple listings such as allergies and recent lab results, she said. Tens of millions of Americans with chronic conditions need far more detailed information, such as pathology reports for cancer patients or medical images for people with knee injuries.  Apple\u2019s push into medical records is its latest effort to break into the $3.2 trillion U.S. health-care market. Last year, the company announced its first medical study of heart rhythms using the Apple Watch and it launched HealthKit in 2014, providing a way for different health apps to share information.  HealthKit helped Apple earn the trust of physicians and hospitals since it includes standards that comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, said Richard Milani, a physician at Ochsner Health System in New Orleans who focuses on tech in health care, and works with Apple.  Dr. Milani said HealthKit helped create a secure system that can be used to transfer medical records to the Health Records feature. Apple said Health Records will encrypt patients\u2019 information to protect their privacy.  Apple also is adopting the leading standard for transferring electronic records known as the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources, or FHIR, making it easier for hospitals and medical-records vendors to share information with the iPhone maker, he said.  Apple said it won\u2019t receive any health-record data. Instead, users will be able to add a health provider on their phone and import their records directly from the provider to the device. The company said the system is the same it uses for corporate email, allowing information to go from a corporate server directly to the phone without Apple ever seeing it.  Users will be able to back up their health records to iCloud, and that information will be encrypted with only users having the key to the data on their device.  Apple said it has no plans to monetize Health Records and designed the feature to create a better health experience for users.  Dr. Milani said the company has told hospitals the same thing. \u201cThe only way to monetize this is to say, \u2018We offer something a competitor doesn\u2019t offer to sell more devices,\u2019\u201d he said.  If it works, Health Records could ease a burden on patients, Dr. Milani said. He envisions a future where an iPhone user from Louisiana might be on vacation in Michigan and in need of medical treatment. Rather than the hospital having to look up that patient\u2019s records, the patient can pull them up on a phone.  \u201cThis is a consumer-empowerment move,\u201d Dr. Milani said. \u201cYou\u2019ll have all the information about you and you\u2019ll control it, and that\u2019s exactly who should control it.\u201d  Write to Tripp Mickle at Tripp.Mickle@wsj.com", "stock": "AAPL", "label": -1, "date": "2018-01-24", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-dives-into-complex-field-your-medical-records-1516832897"}, {"article": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Women at Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) working in U.S.-based technical jobs filed 238 internal complaints about gender discrimination or sexual harassment between 2010 and 2016, according to court filings made public on Monday.

REUTERS/Brian Snyder/File Photo  The figure was cited by plaintiffs suing Microsoft for systematically denying pay raises or promotions to women at the world\u2019s largest software company. Microsoft denies it had any such policy.  The lawsuit, filed in Seattle federal court in 2015, is attracting wider attention after a series of powerful men have left or been fired from their jobs in entertainment, the media and politics for sexual misconduct.  Plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys are pushing to proceed as a class action lawsuit, which could cover more than 8,000 women.  More details about Microsoft\u2019s human resources practices were made public on Monday in legal filings submitted as part of that process.  The two sides are exchanging documents ahead of trial, which has not been scheduled.  Out of 118 gender discrimination complaints filed by women at Microsoft, only one was deemed \u201cfounded\u201d by the company, according to the unsealed court filings.  Attorneys for the women described the number of complaints as \u201cshocking\u201d in the court filings, and said the response by Microsoft\u2019s investigations team was \u201clacklustre.\u201d  Companies generally keep information about internal discrimination complaints private, making it unclear how the number of complaints at Microsoft compares to those at its competitors.  In a statement on Tuesday, Microsoft said it had a robust system to investigate concerns raised by its employees, and that it wanted them to speak up.  Microsoft budgets more than $55 million a year to promote diversity and inclusion, it said in court filings. The company had about 74,000 U.S. employees at the end of 2017.  Microsoft said the plaintiffs cannot cite one example of a pay or promotion problem in which Microsoft\u2019s investigations team should have found a violation of company policy but did not.  U.S. District Judge James Robart has not yet ruled on the plaintiffs\u2019 request for class action status.  A Reuters review of federal lawsuits filed between 2006 and 2016 revealed hundreds containing sexual harassment allegations where companies used common civil litigation tactics to keep potentially damning information under wraps.  Microsoft had argued that the number of womens\u2019 human resources complaints should be secret because publicizing the outcomes could deter employees from reporting future abuses.

The quarter was the 10th in a row of more than 90 percent revenue growth for its flagship Azure cloud computing service, which directly competes with Amazon.com Inc\u2019s (AMZN.O) Amazon Web Services.  Amazon customers hoping to avoid being locked into one service could be helping growth, said Kim Forrest, an equity analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group. \u201cIf you\u2019re really smart you\u2019ll have not one provider but two,\u201d she said.  Since Chief Executive Satya Nadella took the helm in 2014, Microsoft\u2019s cloud business - which includes products such as Office 365, Dynamic 365 and Azure - has emerged as a major growth area.  Revenue from what Microsoft calls its intelligent cloud segment rose 15.3 percent to $7.8 billion in the company\u2019s fiscal second quarter, including 98 percent growth for Azure. Analysts on average had expected $7.51 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Amazon Web Services is the leader of the $14.4 billion cloud computing market with more than 31.8 percent market share, but Azure has been growing fast and holds the No. 2 position with 13.9 percent of the market, according to 2017 third quarter estimates by research firm Canalys.

Besides Azure, Microsoft\u2019s other businesses also grew. Revenue from its productivity and business unit, which includes the Office 365 service, was up 24.7 percent to $8.95 billion.

The nine justices will hear arguments on Tuesday in a case that pits the interests of tech companies and privacy advocates in safeguarding customer data against the demands of law enforcement in obtaining information crucial to criminal and counterterrorism investigations.  The case began with a 2013 warrant obtained by prosecutors for emails of a suspect in a drug trafficking investigation that were stored in Microsoft computer servers in Dublin. The company challenged whether a domestic warrant covered data stored abroad. The Justice Department said because Microsoft is based in the United States, prosecutors were entitled to the data.  The case is being closely watched by other countries wrestling with similar concerns, including members of the European Union. A ruling is due by the end of June.  A 2016 decision by the New York-based 2nd U.S. Court of Appeals siding with Microsoft marked a victory for tech firms that increasingly offer cloud computing services in which data is stored remotely. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration appealed that ruling to the Supreme Court.  Globally dominant American tech companies have expressed concern that customers will go elsewhere if they think the U.S. government\u2019s reach extends to data centers all around the world without changes being made to the law.  Microsoft, which has 100 data centers in 40 countries, was the first American company to challenge a domestic search warrant seeking data held outside the United States.  Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president and chief legal officer, told reporters last week the U.S. government should not be able to act unilaterally to access such data without taking into account the laws and interests of other countries.  \u201cIt\u2019s more likely to be a recipe for international tension and chaos,\u201d Smith said.  Solicitor General Noel Francisco, the administration\u2019s top lawyer in Supreme Court cases, said in court papers that a ruling for Microsoft \u201cwould hamper domestic law enforcement and counterterrorism efforts.\u201d  If the Supreme Court were to rule in favor of Microsoft, the government could still gain access data held overseas, but the process would be more cumbersome and potentially take longer.  Lawmakers are considering making changes to the 1986 law.  Bipartisan legislation has been introduced in Congress to update the statute, a move backed by both Microsoft and the administration. The measure would let U.S. judges issue warrants while giving companies an avenue to object if the request conflicts with foreign law. If Congress were to pass the bill before the Supreme Court rules, the case would likely become moot.  BEYOND REACH  Though Microsoft is based in the United States - Redmond, Washington, to be precise - the appeals court said the emails were beyond the reach of domestic search warrants obtained under a 1986 U.S. law called the Stored Communications Act.  The Microsoft customer whose emails were sought told the company he was based in Ireland when he signed up for his account.  Other companies including IBM Corp, Amazon.com Inc, Apple Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google filed court papers backing Microsoft. Google has mounted challenges similar to Microsoft\u2019s.  The administration has the support of 35 states led by Vermont who say they routinely seek access to data stored overseas, especially in cases involving child pornography.  Several foreign governments, including Ireland and Britain, filed court papers raising concerns about the U.S. government\u2019s position.  Ireland\u2019s government said in its brief that the question of how law enforcement authorities can access such information is already covered by a 2001 treaty with the United States that allows for information sharing and enforcement of court orders.  The treaty\u2019s procedures \u201crepresent the most appropriate means to address requests such as those which are the object of the warrant in question,\u201d Ireland\u2019s brief said.  The European Commission, representing the 28-country European Union, filed a brief saying that when a country is seeking data from outside its jurisdiction \u201cthe interests and laws of that foreign jurisdiction must be taken into account.\u201d  The Supreme Court has ruled twice in recent years in major cases concerning how criminal law applies to new technology, both times ruling against law enforcement. In 2012, the court held that a warrant is required to place a GPS tracking device on a vehicle. In 2014, the court ruled that police need a warrant to search a cellphone seized during an arrest.  In the court\u2019s current term, which ends in June, the justices are due to rule on another privacy issue on whether police need search warrants to access cellphone location information held by wireless carriers. Based on the Nov. 29 oral argument, the justices appear likely to rule against law enforcement again.", "stock": "MSFT", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-26", "source": "reuters", "url": "https://in.reuters.com/article/usa-court-microsoft/rpt-u-s-supreme-court-weighs-microsoft-overseas-data-fight-idINL2N1QD2B7"}, {"article": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks jumped on Wednesday and the Dow closed above 26,000 for the first time as investors\u2019 expectations for higher earnings lifted stocks across sectors.

Nearly 50 percent were found to be supported at least in part following an investigation, she said, and more than half of those resulted in the termination of an employee who engaged in unacceptable behaviour.  The unusual publication of such data comes as the world\u2019s largest software company is defending a lawsuit which alleges it systematically denied pay raises or promotions to women. Microsoft denies it has ever had such a policy.  The lawsuit, filed in Seattle federal court in 2015, is attracting wider attention after a series of powerful men have left or been fired from their jobs in entertainment, the media and politics for sexual misconduct.  Microsoft also investigated 84 complaints of gender discrimination last year, Hogan said, and found around 10 percent of those to be supported at least in part.  Earlier this week, Reuters reported on the contents of unsealed court documents which showed that out of 118 gender discrimination complaints filed by women in U.S.-based technical jobs at Microsoft between 2010 and 2016, only one was deemed \u201cfounded\u201d by the company.

The company is also releasing a blueprint for firms that want to move health data to the cloud while following privacy regulations. The company made the announcements ahead of a key health IT conference next week.  It\u2019s part of a renewed push into the health space by Microsoft, which has had several fits and starts in an area that has bedeviled many technology companies. A year ago, Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella tasked Lee to look at where Microsoft\u2019s cloud, AI and research work could make the company indispensable to health-care clients. Amazon.com Inc. has also announced plans to offer health services to its own employees, increasing the chance some medical companies will see the e-commerce and cloud leader as a rival, not a partner.  Microsoft Corporate Vice President Peter Lee Microsoft  Microsoft appeals to larger, highly regulated customers in the industry, while Amazon does better with health startups, said Kris G\u00f6sser, marketing vice president at Datica, which helps health companies move to the cloud with Azure and Amazon Web Services. Many of Microsoft\u2019s health-care products and ideas aren\u2019t new, but large, conservative firms are more likely to trust the company because it\u2019s a familiar partner, he said.  Microsoft is also offering templates for health companies that want to use its Teams corporate chat program, a rival to Slack, while ensuring conversations follow the industry\u2019s privacy and data-retention rules.  The company has also used its machine-learning tools to create Project Empower MD, a tool that automatically transcribes patient and doctor conversations, along with key moments from appointments, and formats the information in a standard way.  In several of these cases, Microsoft isn\u2019t creating finished products to sell but rather handing health companies tools that their own software engineers can use for in-house applications. Project Empower MD, for example, can be tweaked to how different doctors work, said Lee.  \u201cFor anyone who wants to innovate, anyone who wants to be able to extract the value of cloud computing and AI in health care, it\u2019s very important that the Microsoft platforms be a place for that,\" Lee said.", "stock": "MSFT", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-28", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-28/microsoft-looks-to-lure-health-care-companies-to-its-cloud-with-new-tools"}, {"article": "Microsoft Corp. will open data centers in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, its first in the Middle East, part of the software maker\u2019s rapid geographic expansion to win cloud-computing business worldwide and pry customers from Amazon.com Inc.

While companies jockeying for a piece of the business pushed for the use of multiple cloud providers, the Pentagon announced its decision to go with a single company. The department already has difficulty moving information, particularly to the battlefield, and using multiple clouds would \u201cexponentially increase the complexity,\u201d Tim Van Name, deputy director of the \u200eDefense Digital Service, said on a call with reporters.  The scope of the Defense Department\u2019s current technology needs -- 3.4 million users and 4 million devices -- hints at the massive size of the award. Chief Management Officer Jay Gibson confirmed that \u201cwe anticipate this will be a multibillion-dollar contract,\u201d although the Pentagon hasn\u2019t given an estimate of the project\u2019s cost.  \u201cWhichever one of you wins this, I\u2019m challenging you to bring your \u2018A Game,\u2019\u201d Air Force Brigadier General David Krumm, deputy director for requirements for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told industry representatives during an earlier briefing near the Pentagon in Washington\u2019s Virginia suburbs. \u201cThis is going to make a difference like few things have to get data to our war-fighters when and where he or she needs it.\u201d  A draft request for proposals issued Wednesday sought industry input for a two-year base contract with options for renewal over eight more years. A final request would be released in early May, with a contract award as soon as September, officials told the gathering.  Artificial Intelligence  Cloud services -- in which computing power and storage are hosted in remote data centers run by a third-party company rather than on-site in locally owned machines -- can range from powering email and storing personnel files to running complex decision-making algorithms. The Pentagon said it\u2019s making the shift to the cloud to strengthen its use of emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence, machine learning and the internet of things.  Having already won two other government cloud contacts, Amazon Web Services is widely perceived as the front-runner for the Defense Department award. Industry groups had called for multiple contract awards, which could improve the opportunities for companies including Oracle, Microsoft, Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and International Business Machines Corp.  Chanda Brooks, a Pentagon contracting officer, told the gathering Wednesday that market research shows that multiple companies are capable of meeting the requirements and that the \u201cfull and open competition\u201d would result in a single award. Van Name, of the \u200eDefense Digital Service, which recruits technology experts from the private sector for stints working on projects at the Pentagon, denied that the department is leaning toward Amazon.  \u201cIt\u2019s about the best proposal,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have no favorites.\u201d  The industry pushed back on the department\u2019s sole-source position.  Roger Waldron, president of the Coalition for Government Procurement, which represents defense contractors including Oracle, IBM and Microsoft, said \u201cgoing to a single vendor closes the market to just that vendor for a decade.\u201d  Microsoft and IBM also separately criticized the department\u2019s decision. Microsoft said it was \u201cdisappointed,\u201d while Sam Gordy, general manager of IBM U.S. Federal, called the move \u201cflawed.\u201d Google declined to comment, and Oracle didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.  Scope of Initiative  Underscoring the scope of the initiative, Essye Miller, the Defense Department\u2019s acting chief information officer, said the Pentagon\u2019s information technology covers \u201cover 1,700 data centers and approximately 500 different cloud initiatives across the department.\u201d  Seattle-based Amazon leads the cloud infrastructure market with 44.2 percent, followed by Microsoft\u2019s Azure with 7.1 percent, China\u2019s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. with 3 percent and Google Cloud Platform at 2.3 percent, based on total cloud industry 2016 revenue, according to research firm Gartner Inc.  Amazon already has a cloud contract with the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency dating back to 2013 that\u2019s valued at $600 million. The online retail giant led by Jeff Bezos has the fastest-growing lobbying arm among tech companies and has spoken to the Pentagon about cloud or procurement since at least 2016, according to federal lobbying disclosures.  Oracle\u2019s Stake  Oracle has a particular interest in how the contract is awarded because it has long-term contracts with multiple government agencies that use its flagship database to store information on their own systems. As the agencies look to switch to cloud computing and eye market leader Amazon, these moves threaten Oracle\u2019s traditional revenue sources. Oracle has tried to protect its database business by offering cloud services of its own, but has come late to that market.  Technology companies worried that the Pentagon favors Amazon point to the decision in early February to award a contract of as much as $950 million to REAN Cloud LLC, an Amazon partner, to help migrate its data to the cloud. On Monday, the Pentagon said it was unaware of the award, made by its Silicon Valley-based innovation unit, and reduced the contract to $65 million.  In a statement Wednesday, Sekhar Puli, REAN Cloud\u2019s managing partner, said that \u201cbased on the threat of legal action and protest by the old guard, the only winners in this delay are those large companies that stand to lose money if the DoD proceeds with innovation. In the meantime, the cost of maintaining antiquated government infrastructure has not subsided.\u201d  Oracle formally protested the REAN contract in February, saying the company was opening a door for Amazon Web Services and asserting that Amazon pressures clients to use REAN, according to a person familiar with the filing.  Respective Strengths  The companies competing for the Defense Department contract are expected to put their respective strengths on display as they present bids. While Amazon is the leader in cloud services, Mountain View, California-based Google emphasizes its focus on security and Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft touts its ability to move existing databases onto the cloud in stages, while keeping some tasks and data in-house if the customer wants.  The transition to the cloud could threaten on-site database providers such as Redwood City, California-based Oracle and IBM, based in Armonk, New York, that have long supplied government technology products but were later entrants into the cloud market.  \u201cFor Oracle and IBM, any government contract feels important. They\u2019re entrenched government vendors,\" said Lydia Leong, a cloud analyst at Gartner. \u201cShifts to the cloud and going off of their architecture is not a happy situation for them.\u201d  \u2014 With assistance by Mark Bergen, Dina Bass, Naomi Nix, and Nico Grant", "stock": "MSFT", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-07", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-07/amazon-oracle-microsoft-jockey-for-pentagon-s-cloud-business"}, {"article": "At Microsoft Corp.'s Dutch research facility at the Delft University of Technology, several large cylindrical metal tubes hang from the ceiling.  Each tube - a dilution refrigerator used to cool circuits down to temperatures colder than deep space - costs more than $500,000, and has helped Microsoft's researchers create an elusive subatomic particle that the company hopes will serve as the building block of its effort to create commercially-viable quantum computers.  The scientists say they have clear evidence of the creation of Majorana fermions \u2013 an elementary particle that its own anti-particle \u2013in a tiny wire that is composed of both semiconducting and superconducting materials, according to research published in the journal Nature Wednesday.  A clean room where nanowire circuits are manufactured at Microsoft's research facility. Photographer: Jeremy Kahn/Bloomberg  The unique properties of these fermions means that they could be used to create quantum computers with much lower error rates than the designs being trialed by rival companies, such as International Business Machines Corp. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, that are also racing to bring quantum computers to market. Currently, those other designs produce too many errors in their calculations to be useful for practical applications, such as the ability to create new chemical catalysts or break the most popular forms of encryption.  Microsoft will now attempt to braid these tiny fermions to create qubits \u2013 the fundamental calculating hardware used in quantum computers. Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s chief executive officer, has said that quantum computing is one of three breakthrough technologies \u2013 the others are artificial intelligence and augmented reality \u2013 that will be critical to the future of the company. Microsoft hopes to eventually rent time on quantum computers to businesses through its cloud computing network.  So far, Microsoft\u2019s efforts have trailed some of its competitors. D-Wave Systems Inc. in 2011 became the first company to sell a quantum computer, although its technology can only perform a certain subset of mathematical problems. Google and IBM have machines that are thought to be close to achieving \u201cquantum supremacy\u201d \u2013 the ability to tackle a problem too complex to solve on any standard supercomputer.  Microsoft, in contrast, hasn\u2019t yet managed to create a working qubit.  The company has devoted significant resources to prove that it can use Majorana fermions to build a less error-prone \u2013 and thus potentially more useful \u2013 machine. The existence of particles that would also contain their own anti-particle was postulated by Italian theoretical physicist Ettore Majorana in 1937. But researchers only observed evidence suggesting the unique fermions actually existed in 2012. But, as the Microsoft researchers write in Nature, data from these earlier experiments \u201cwere noisy,\u201d leading skeptics to speculate that they could be caused by other phenomena. In the new paper, the Microsoft scientists offer much clearer data that, the company says, should silence any remaining doubters.  The U.S. tech company has assembled a globe-spanning team of scientists for its quantum effort, working at labs in the U.S., the Netherlands, Denmark and Australia. It has also put one of its most experienced executives, Todd Holmdahl, who previously delivered both the Xbox game console and the HoloLens augmented reality goggles, in charge of the project. Holmdahl said in an interview with Bloomberg in November that Microsoft would have a quantum computer on the market within five years.  At Delft, Leo Kouwenhoven, a physicist who now works as the principal researcher for the company, gave a tour of the lab, which is also shared by academics working on several different approaches to building a quantum computer \u2013 including a rival team that is funded by Intel Corp. Microsoft soon plans to move into an entire wing of a different building as it scales up its quantum computing project.  Next to a few of the fridges are giant metal doughnuts \u2013 150-pound magnets that the Microsoft team is using to try to create the braiding, essential for their qubits to be less-error prone. The magnets, Kouwenhoven admits, are a double-edged sword, as their size and weight also make the experiments more difficult to run. He said Microsoft believes the calculations of its quantum computer \u2013 assuming it actually manages to create one \u2013 will be between 1,000 and 10,000 times more accurate than what existing machines have been able to achieve.  Kouwenhoven said it is his group\u2019s goal to have produced a working qubit using Majorana fermions by the end of this year. On the floor above where the refrigerators are installed, young graduate students sit at computers analyzing colorful graphic displays that show what is happening inside the circuitry deep within the refrigerator. Kouwenhoven stops to ask if one if he has been able to see indications of Majorana fermions braiding as they have ramped up the power of their magnets. \u201cNo,\u201d the student shakes his head. Kouwenhoven shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s harder to get accurate measurements at higher magnetic energies,\u201d he says. \u201cSo far we haven\u2019t seen evidence of this transition to topological phase.\u201d Theory, Kouwenhoven knows, is on his side.

In his typical hyper-excited, semi-shouting style, Ballmer capped his presentation with, \"Windows! Windows! Windows!\"  That was then. Windows hasn't been the heart and soul of Microsoft for several years, and Microsoft made it extra official last week. In a corporate reorganization, Windows was effectively downgraded in the Microsoft corporate hierarchy. The person now in charge of Windows occupies a lower rung of the organization than his predecessor did and reports to the senior executive in charge of Microsoft's current top priorities: corporate software, cloud computing and artificial intelligence.  It was a bureaucratic shift but one charged with symbolism. Windows is no longer the sun in Microsoft's solar system around which all other planets spin. Windows is an outlying moon -- an important one, but still just a moon. \"The future of Windows is bright,\" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in an email to employees on Thursday. It seemed like an afterthought.  Windows! Windows! Windows! Microsoft's Windows revenue has remained relatively steady in the last decade, but the software accounts for a shrinking share of total company revenue Source: Gadfly calculations from Microsoft financial disclosures.  Microsoft's corporate reshuffle reflects the company's financial reality. In 2010, the Windows systems for personal computers were the biggest source of revenue for the company, making up about 28 percent of total sales. In Microsoft's most recent fiscal year, Windows was only the third-biggest source of revenue, behind the Office software bundle and a group of technologies for businesses including computer server software, databases and Microsoft's Azure cloud-computing service. Windows' share of total company revenue was just 16 percent after adjusting for Windows sales that the company spreads out over multiple years.  By design, Nadella -- who's been the boss for four years -- has broken sharply from his predecessors, Bill Gates and Ballmer. And nothing signaled that dividing line between Microsoft's past and future more than Nadella's choice to de-emphasize Windows.  The changing focus was clear from his first months on the job. In a 2014 memo to employees that was Nadella's first mission statement as CEO, he peppered 10 mentions of the Windows operating system for PCs into a roughly 3,000 word missive, and not until the 21st paragraph. He used the word \"cloud\" 21 times.  Heart and Soul Windows was the third-biggest source of revenue for Microsoft last year Source: Microsoft  Nadella's first significant product unveiling as CEO was a version of Microsoft Office tailored to iPads. The software had been developed when Ballmer was still in charge, but it sat on a shelf as the company debated whether the Office app for iPads would hurt Windows sales. Fear of harming the Windows franchise won out until Nadella arrived.  Under Nadella, Microsoft has also made Windows less of a software Big Bang. The entire company used to be organized around developing and releasing a significant new edition of Windows every three years or so. Now, Windows is just another piece of software or app that gets updated continually, like Netflix or Apple's iPhone operating system.  There's less a new version of Windows than many slightly new ones that come out regularly. Microsoft also made those regular updates part of the cost of buying a new computer or signing a contract for a fleet of business PCs rather than paying for a new machine or upgrading the operating system when a new version comes out. It's remarkable how smoothly Microsoft managed a fundamental change to how Windows is developed and released to the public.  Even if Microsoft had kept stressing Windows, the technology world was moving away from it. Personal computer sales have been declining since 2012. Adding up smartphone, tablet and PC sales, Windows software powers less than 15 percent of all the computing devices sold in the world each year. And Windows is nonexistent in emerging areas of technology including driverless cars and internet connected devices for the home.  Microsoft's answer has been to stress areas of technology where it is relevant and has opportunities to lead in the future. That goes back to cloud computing, artificial intelligence and corporate software. All the data amassed by autonomous cars has to be saved somewhere, and it requires hefty computing power to analyze it all. Microsoft wants to be in the middle of all that. The company just won't be there with Windows, Windows, Windows.

Apple still collects our data \u2014 and reserves the right to share it \u2014 but the company has a much better track record than newer tech titans.  \"The truth is, we could make a ton of money if we monetized our customer \u2014 if our customer was our product,\" Cook said on Wednesday. \"We've elected not to do that.\" Asked what he'd do if he were in Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's shoes, he replied, \"I wouldn't be in this situation.\"  In reality, Apple collects more information about its customers than Facebook because it offers more products and services. It knows everything from an iPhone's location to its owner's taste in movies and music. It's all in the company's privacy statement, including the frank admission that Apple will share the data with \"strategic partners that work with Apple to provide products and services, or that help Apple market to customers\" and with law enforcement. Apple also lets applications that run on its platform (including Facebook) hoover up data. And it does have a small ad platform that allows targeted advertising.  Apple's closest equivalent in terms of data collection, sharing and \"pass-through\" to app developers is Google, which offers roughly the same array of services (plus search) and also owns mobile and desktop operating systems. The difference is that Apple has imposed some voluntary restrictions on itself: For example, it anonymizes location data (unless you're using the \"Find My iPhone\" feature) and generally employs \"differential privacy\" \u2014 a cryptography-based practice of obtaining usage and preference data without linking it to specific users. Google and Microsoft also use that to some degree, and a co-inventor of differential privacy, Cynthia Dwork, has even worked for Microsoft Research, but Apple was the first to market the technique as an advantage for its customers.  Cook clearly thinks of these self-restrictions as a good way of staving off external regulation. On Wednesday, he scolded Facebook for not being as far-sighted. \"I think the best regulation is no regulation, is self-regulation,\" he said. \"However, I think we're beyond that here.\"  As a user, however, I wouldn't put much trust in any company's ability to regulate itself. Cook has been wary of monetizing Apple's user base, but he won't be CEO forever. And people do change their mind, especially when it comes to picking up money that's there for the taking. Regulation \u2014 such as the EU's General Data Protection regulation, launching in May \u2014 is a more reliable way to ensure a level playing field. That's why Google, Apple and Microsoft all have good, convenient privacy controls which allow the user to turn off various kinds of data collection, erase data that companies already have and opt out of targeted advertising. Facebook, too, promises to put such controls in place soon.  But even external regulation isn't a reliable guarantee of privacy. Most people won't fiddle with the controls because they may not even realize what all the fuss is about. And by default, companies with advertising-based business models will want to collect as much information as they can and anonymize as little of it as they can. Neither Google nor Facebook, for example, will make the same commitment as Microsoft that no ads will be targeted based on your email and chat contents. Nor will they make it as easy as Apple and Microsoft make to shut off ad personalization.  No regulator will take care of that: It's not their goal to kill off the ad-based business model and with it Facebook and Google, and the model won't work without data collection and ad targeting.  The only real guarantee that companies won't go overboard in invading customers' privacy is that they have large revenue streams which make it an unnecessary risk. Apple is reliable in this regard: It's a hardware company that also sells content and software on commission and on a subscription basis. Microsoft, with its cloud, software licensing and subscription businesses, is even less likely to go rogue in data collection because it no longer has a mobile platform to speak of.  That's why Microsoft and Apple aren't suffering much from the Cambridge Analytica-triggered tech sell-off. Microsoft shares are up 4.5 percent since the beginning of the year, Apple shares are down just 1.63 percent. That compares to Google's 4.6 percent drop and Facebook's 13.3 percent dive. I believe the gains made by Twitter and Snap, two companies fully dependent on ads and information-gathering, are a temporary fluke: They aren't as frequently mentioned in connection with data harvesting as Google and Facebook. As heavier regulation of the ad model becomes reality, they will inevitably suffer as much as their ad-based peers.  Monetization through ads was the only relatively easy choice for companies not offering any products or services that people wanted to buy. That revenue stream, however, is not as easy to hold on to as those coming directly from customers. Those of us who remember the fat days of ad-financed media know that better than anyone. The tech firms that fell back on ads will need to offer value to customers, not advertisers, as the best \"legacy\" media companies have learned to do.

The law, enacted March 23 as part of the massive spending bill, lays out rules for international data requests by law enforcement. It gives tech companies an easier way to navigate conflicts between government demands and customer privacy expectations.  The Supreme Court case, which the justices heard in February, stemmed from the government\u2019s use of a 1986 law to seek emails from an unidentified account kept on a Microsoft Corp. server in Ireland. The Justice Department said the messages would provide evidence of drug trafficking.  The Justice Department said in a court filing made public Saturday that it has obtained a fresh warrant for the information under the new law. U.S. Solicitor General Noel Francisco said the Supreme Court should send the dispute back to a lower court so that the case could be dismissed as legally moot.

The measure also creates rules for American companies when they receive information requests from foreign governments. The U.S. will be able to make agreements with other nations governing access.

Companies making and selling AI software will need to be held responsible for potential harm caused by \u201cunreasonable practices\u201d \u2013 if a self-driving car program is set up in an unsafe manner that causes injury or death, for example, Microsoft said. And as AI and automation boost the number of laborers in the gig-economy or on-demand jobs, Microsoft said technology companies need to take responsibility and advocate for protections and benefits for workers, rather than passing the buck by claiming to be ``just the technology platform\u2019\u2019 enabling all this change.  Microsoft broaches these ideas in a 149-page book entitled \u201cThe Future Computed,\u201d which will also be the subject of a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, next week. As Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft seeks to be a leader in AI and automating work tasks, it\u2019s also trying to get out in front of the challenges expected to arise from promising new technologies, such as job losses and everyday citizens who may be hurt or disadvantaged by malfunctioning or biased algorithms.  \u201cWe are trying to be clear-eyed in talking about the challenges,\u201d said Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith, who will sit on the Davos panel and co-wrote the introduction to the book.  Microsoft is working on some of these areas through groups such as the Partnership on AI, which includes rivals like Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, Apple Inc. and Facebook Inc. Still, the call for more regulation in an emerging area like AI is unusual for technology companies, said Ryan Calo, a professor at the University of Washington School of Law, who has read the book.  \u201cThere are a bunch of players in this space, and if you are Microsoft you want to be seen as trusted,\u201d said Calo, who did not assist the company on the book but has consulted for it on other issues and whose lab is partially funded with donations from Microsoft. Whatever the company\u2019s motivations, the area is an important one, Calo said. \u201cAny sufficiently transformative technology is going to require new laws,\u201d he said.

The development of laws will come a few years after that, Smith said.  In the nearer term, Microsoft is advocating for changes to labor laws to properly classify workers and allocate benefits like health care and retirement planning to people with jobs such as an Uber driver or Postmates delivery person. Smith expects there will be a need for a new category of worker to cover these employees, who are neither full-time nor independent contractors, he said.  \u201cThe technology industry needs to engage to change the perception that it reaps the benefits of technology progress at the expense of workers who are displaced or left without protections, benefits or long-term career paths,\u201d the company writes in the book. \u201cCompanies that do not acknowledge the importance of worker protections and benefits risk damage to their brands and face the possibility that lawmakers and the courts will step in to impose regulations.\u201d", "stock": "MSFT", "label": 1, "date": "2018-01-18", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-18/microsoft-says-ai-advances-will-require-new-laws-regulations"}, {"article": "Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft Corp. and the second-richest person in the world, said there\u2019s a danger that U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach could damage the U.S.\u2019s influence in Africa in the long term.  Other countries like China are continuing to push into the African continent, and the U.S. should not pull back, Gates said in an interview with Bloomberg News Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait in Davos, Switzerland. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has spent about $12 billion on global health projects in the last five years, focusing on diseases like malaria and tuberculosis.

In its first major product event of the year, Apple will return to its roots in the education market. The event on Tuesday at Lane Technical College Prep High School in Chicago will mark the first time Apple has held a product launch geared toward education since 2012 when it unveiled a tool for designing e-books for the iPad. It\u2019s also a rare occasion for an Apple confab outside its home state of California.  A second grader works on an Apple Inc. iPad in Sandy, Utah. Photographer: George Frey/Bloomberg  In Chicago, the world\u2019s most-valuable technology company plans to show off a new version of its cheapest iPad that should appeal to the education market, said people familiar with the matter. The company will also showcase new software for the classroom, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private plans. Apple declined to comment.  Steve Jobs made schools a priority for Apple early in its life. But as the company has driven toward mass-market and higher-margin products in recent years, Google and Microsoft have had success breaking into classrooms with inexpensive laptops and tablets. Last year, the global educational technology market generated $17.7 billion in revenue, according to research firm Frost & Sullivan.  Apple accounted for 17 percent of mobile computing shipments to American students in kindergarten through high school, according to data from the third quarter published by Futuresource Consulting. Devices running Google\u2019s operating systems on Chromebooks or Android tablets held 60 percent of the market, and Windows PCs had 22 percent. While Macs and iPads make up less than 20 percent of Apple\u2019s sales combined, students and teachers are a key market to drive future purchases.  A new, cheaper MacBook laptop is in the works and likely destined to replace the MacBook Air at a price less than $1,000, but it probably won\u2019t be ready in time for next week, the people said. The MacBook Air, introduced about a decade ago, hasn\u2019t seen a major change since 2010, the same year the iPad came out. Although the laptop is popular with college students, it has languished as Apple focuses on more expensive Macs.  Rival laptops have made inroads into the education market lately, a field that originally helped Apple make its name. The sector is prized among industry giants because students learn to use a certain type of device, then head into the workforce and spread the technology wider.  With a recent advertising onslaught, Apple is hoping to capture more young minds with the iPad. The company has revised its tablet strategy over the years by releasing different versions at a variety of price points. That\u2019s helped the iPad business return to growth after multiple declining quarters. Still, demand for tablets is weak. According to research firm IDC, the market shrank by about 7 percent in 2017. Apple grew 3 percent last year and leads the industry with about a quarter of the market.  Apple's Tablet Roller Coaster iPad growth is returning after sales slowed for several quarters  Apple currently offers a slew of different education-related software. The company\u2019s Classroom app for the iPad lets teachers manage Apple devices that are assigned to students for their classwork. There\u2019s also an iTunes U app that lets teachers issue homework, grade assignments and post lessons online. It also lets students complete assignments and take tests. The company offers a software coding curriculum via the Swift Playgrounds app and sells interactive textbooks through its e-book store.  More software is coming. Apple is working on a new version of the iBooks app that\u2019s more in line with the design of the App Store, though it\u2019s unclear if it\u2019ll be shown next week, people familiar with the project have said.  In an invitation to the Chicago event, Apple said it will introduce \u201ccreative new ideas for teachers and students.\u201d Having a venue where attendees can see the new technology in action inside a classroom would be a sound strategy for a company that focuses its announcements on live demonstrations.  Next week\u2019s event will also provide an opportunity for Apple to boast about the work it\u2019s doing with Chicago schools. In December, the company partnered with the city\u2019s public school system and City Colleges of Chicago on a coding curriculum for thousands of local students. Apple has also discussed additional education-related programs with the city, people familiar with the talks said.  According to Apple\u2019s website, the school where the event will take place is not an \u201cApple Distinguished School,\u201d a designation given to institutions with curriculum that uses Apple products and provides iPads to all students.  Apple has tried citywide iPad deals for students in the past, with little success. In 2013, the Los Angeles Unified School District said it would spend $30 million to provide some students with iPads. The deal was expected to become a $1.3 billion initiative to give every student in the district an iPad, but it fell apart.  Such a deal won\u2019t be announced with Chicago next week, people familiar with the plans said. But the city could see more of Apple in the future.

Separately, according to a statement from the office of British Prime Minister Theresa May, President Donald Trump told May on Tuesday that passing the proposals was \"vital\" to the two countries\u2019 security.  The White House said in its own statement that Trump and May would \"advocate for legislation\" around a pending data agreement like the one in the congressional proposals. The White House, however, did not mention a specific bill.  The Cloud Act, according to a statement from its sponsors, would allow the U.S. to make agreements with foreign countries for dealing with law enforcement requests.

Now we have at least three, Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Facebook Inc.  It's almost too many to be angry about at once.  Two notable magazine pieces dug into the power of these tech giants this month. Both articles are worth sitting down with when you have some time. Last week, Wired looked at Facebook's handling of Russian meddling in the U.S. presidential election, capturing growing animosity that seems to be coming at the company from all corners lately.  On Tuesday, the New York Times Magazine published \"The Case Against Google.\" The piece recounts how Google crushed a small search competitor and how the European Commission stepped into the regulatory void to fine Google $2.7 billion. (Google is appealing).  The most compelling part is the depiction of regulators' fight with Microsoft: Even though they failed to punish Microsoft in any meaningful way, the media scrutiny, paired with antitrust monitors, had a significant effect on the company's behavior -- simply because employees got nervous.    \"Microsoft was so powerful, and Google so new, that the young search engine could have been killed off, some insiders at both companies believe,\" the author writes. He quotes Gene Burrus, a former Microsoft lawyer: \u201cThere was a new culture of compliance, and we didn\u2019t want to get in trouble again, so nothing happened.\" The piece questions the myth that Google humbled Microsoft on its own. \"The government\u2019s antitrust lawsuit is one reason that Google was eventually able to break Microsoft\u2019s monopoly.\"  But today Google, despite the historic fine it faces, doesn't seem scared. I suspect the company realizes it isn't enemy number one, at least in the U.S. While regulators might have the most legitimate antitrust case against Google, as demonstrated by the EU decision, rising ill-will toward tech giants and their billionaire leaders isn't focused on the search giant. That scrutiny is falling more on Facebook for reasons that have little to do with antitrust violations.  Politicians and others are hammering Facebook for fake content and a broader lack of authenticity. But it's important to note that the company is part of a growing digital advertising duopoly with Google in the U.S. If attention is the new economy online, they dominate our time spent. If it's data about our lives, they have the most of that, too.  And we haven't event talked about Amazon yet. Cities are prostrating themselves at the company's feet, trying to secure its second headquarters. Amazon can do no wrong in consumers' eyes. But if you talk to bankers or business people, Amazon is the one that strikes the most fear in their hearts. It controls more than two-thirds of the U.S. e-book market now. Amazon alone has the stock market's support to enter new industries, drive margins to zero and destroy rivals in search of more scale. It's great for shoppers and terrifying if you're in the grocery or pharmaceutical business.  So if you're a politician looking to quell public concern, or a regulator trying to even the online playing field, what do you do? Do you go after Facebook, the most-derided in the group of late? Do you go after Amazon, whose growth is so staggering that it is responsible for 27 percent of the S&P 500's gains so far this year? Or do you go after Google, a company that makes it easier to figure out where to get the best burrito -- even if that information used to be scraped without permission from reviews at rival Yelp?

A timing quirk in the tax overhaul seemed to give companies such as Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Cisco Systems Inc. -- all of which began their fiscal years before Jan. 1 -- the chance to reduce the foreign cash they\u2019ll accumulate this year and lower their taxes. A press release issued by the IRS on Monday indicates that \u201cif done in the ordinary course of business,\u201d the move won\u2019t be considered as tax avoidance, according to Stephen Shay, a tax and business law professor at Harvard Law School.  \u201cThe light is green for this planning, not red,\u201d said Shay, a former top Treasury official. \u201cIt is great for those whose years beginning before 2018 are still open for the planning.\u201d  While companies taking steps to shift their assets would still owe repatriation taxes, they wouldn\u2019t have as much cash taxed at the higher rate -- \"a major concession\" by the IRS, said independent tax and accounting expert Robert Willens.  The tax law signed by President Donald Trump in December overhauled the international tax system and requires companies to pay a mandatory two-tiered levy on their accumulated foreign income. Cash is taxed at 15.5 percent, while less liquid assets face a rate of 8 percent. Companies have been trying to figure out ways to reduce assets subject to the higher rate.  Another provision in the IRS release also allows multinationals some leeway when calculating their repatriation tax bills. The law appeared to make more foreign entities owned by multinationals subject to the repatriation tax, but the agency said Monday that taxpayers that own less than 5 percent of a foreign entity\u2019s capital or profits won\u2019t be hit by the repatriation tax.  \u2018Pro-Taxpayer\u2019 Notice  Banks and financial institutions will also see a reprieve following the IRS\u2019s guidance that a company\u2019s accounts receivable and accounts payable that are longer than one year will be exempt from the repatriation tax, said John Warner, a tax partner at Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney PC. The financial firms had feared the payments under the loans they issue would have faced the 15.5 percent rate, since they\u2019re generally considered accounts receivable, regardless of their maturities.  \"This is generally pro-taxpayer,\" Warner said.  Still, the agency said it would crack down on some strategies multinationals may use to reduce their offshore tax bills, such as artificially reducing their earnings and profits, cash piles or \"pro-rata\" share of transactions, for foreign entities they have stakes in, own or control.  Those rules will be a big deal to some companies, said Michael Mundaca, the co-director of Ernst & Young\u2019s Washington National tax practice and a former top Treasury Department tax official.

Sales of all devices are stagnating, but the time may have arrived for a hybrid gadget.  It seemed like such a good idea, in theory. And it still seems like a good idea -- again, in theory.  Microsoft Corp. and Qualcomm Inc. are pitching computers that mix elements of tablets and smartphones. That means, in principle, people will soon be able to buy a device that works like a familiar Windows laptop but with the slimmer and lighter form of a tablet computer plus the built-in cellular connections and long battery life of a smartphone.  You might be thinking, that sounds similar to an iPad Pro or Microsoft's own line of Surface computers. Yup. And all these gadgets also owe a debt of gratitude to the MacBook Air, the skinny, battery-conserving laptop Apple Inc. introduced a decade ago.  There's a reason I'm curious but cautious about this category of devices that blend elements of PCs, tablets and smartphones. There have been cellular-connected lightweight computers on the market for years, off and on, including devices powered by Microsoft and Qualcomm five years ago. They never caught on. This time, though, these hybrid devices are a category whose time has come. I think.  Powering Down Personal computer sales peaked in 2011 and have declined each year since Source: IDC  Even as smartphones have become the most important digital devices, there has been much welcome innovation in computers. New technology from PC chip king Intel Corp. and Microsoft's 2012 introduction of the Surface spurred fresh ideas about what a \"computer\" could be.  The Surface has a touchscreen like a smartphone and a detachable keyboard that turns the device into a somewhat compromised tablet-laptop hybrid. Microsoft sold more than $2 billion worth of the gadgets in the six months ended Dec. 31, and some traditional PC makers have found traction with these combo machines, too.  The Surface was followed by the iPad Pro, a similar tablet-plus-keyboard with the heart of a smartphone. Google software supports stripped-down laptops called Chromebooks that have been a huge hit in U.S. schools. These are all relatively recent and welcome reimaginations of conventional computers.  They're not perfect for everyone or every use, but the mixed-up world of computers gives people more choices to find the right devices for them. A PC-tablet hybrid with a fast wireless internet connection is a welcome addition to that stew of options, although there are unanswered questions about the performance and drawbacks of the new machines backed by Microsoft and Qualcomm.  It's also an odd time to be devoting resources to any new type of computer hardware. Global sales of personal computers have dropped for each of the past six years, according to research firm IDC. The research firm's PC data don't include devices like the Surface that have detachable keyboards. Tablet sales are also declining, and smartphone sales have hit a wall. It's not halcyon days for most companies that make computing gadgets.  Hardware Hits a Wall Global sales of computers, tablets and smartphones all declined in 2017. Change in unit shipments from the prior year: Source: IDC  Still, you can see the appeal of trying new concepts in computing. Even if PCs and tablets aren't growth categories, more than 400 million of these gadgets are still sold each year. And each player in the market has its own motivations. Qualcomm, for example, sees greenfield opportunity if it can displace Intel in more PC-type devices.  The big question now is how much of a push the latest cellular-connected PCs will get from their backers. There\u2019s a lot of enthusiasm for the next generation of cellular technology called 5G, which optimists say will usher in a new era of internet-connected devices of all kinds. Intel said on Thursday that it is also collaborating with Microsoft and others to introduce a line of 5G-connected computing devices. The backing of Microsoft, Qualcomm and Intel should bolster the idea of blending smartphones, tablets and computers. That all means that -- in theory -- there's never been a better, and more confusing, time for the \"computer\" market.

Now, that group is bearing its first fruit: Microsoft Genomics, a gene-sequencing service developed with St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.  Microsoft Healthcare NExT head Dr. Peter Lee says the challenges are hard, but there are lots of benefits, tangible and otherwise, to this healthcare push.  A year ago, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella tasked Microsoft Research NExT \u2014 the company's A-team of troubleshooting scientists \u2014 with a new mission: Take the company's most cutting-edge tech and apply it to improving healthcare.  Microsoft Healthcare NExT head and corporate VP Dr. Peter Lee tells Business Insider that this new mandate was so broad, it was a little bit like being dropped in the middle of the ocean and told to find dry land.  \"There's no sign of which way is the right way, and you could swim really far in any one direction before realizing you were going astray.\" And, of course, he says, healthcare is a field that many tech companies have tried to tackle, and failed. You might think you're making progress, but \"then you look down and see the people drowning.\"  \"There was a time where we were just floundering,\" Lee says.  Now, though, Lee feels like Microsoft's efforts have finally begun to bear fruit, in the form of real, actual products that are making a difference to healthcare organizations, hospitals \u2014 and patients' lives.  For instance, on Wednesday, Microsoft announced the general availability of Microsoft Genomics, a gene-sequencing service available to doctors and researchers via the Microsoft Azure cloud platform. That platform was born directly out of joint research between Microsoft and St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.  Microsoft researchers discuss Microsoft Genomics, the company's new gene-sequencing tool, powered by the Microsoft Azure cloud. Microsoft  \"We already got one product out of this push,\" says Lee.  Similarly, Microsoft is announcing the availability and expansion of other partnership-driven services. Microsoft and India's Apollo Hospitals teamed up for a new artificially-intelligent system for detecting tell-tale signs of heart disease in patient data, for instance; it also partnered up with UPMC for Project Empower MD, a note-taking tool for doctors.  Lee says it's been extremely rewarding: The biggest motivator for his team is getting to make a difference in people's lives. Plus, Healthcare NExT gets to work with cutting-edge technology, like Microsoft's partnership with Seattle-based Adaptive Biotechnologies, which is attempting to use AI to detect cancers and other serious maladies with a simple blood test.  \"It's just cool beyond belief,\" says Lee of Adaptive.  Lee says there are more material rewards, too, as these products open new markets for Microsoft \u2014 important, as some analysts estimate that healthcare cloud computing could be a $35 billion market by 2020.  Doctors, surgeons, and researchers have long needed these kinds of tools, says Lee, and Microsoft is happy to deliver. He says healthcare is becoming a \"very large business\" for Microsoft.  \"We don't talk publicly about the dollars, but it's large,\" says Lee.  Not drowning yet  The key that helped Microsoft Healthcare NExT find its way was to take a bigger-picture approach, says Lee. The starting point was to look at the so-called \"hyperscale\" clouds from Microsoft, Amazon, and Google, and try to picture what the world would be like without them.  With that in mind, Lee says, Microsoft started making bets. The Microsoft NExT \"standard playbook\" revolves around forming individual, internal \"startups\" with their own funding and purpose-driven mandates, so the engineers and scientists on the team got organized and got moving.  Some of those self-styled \"startups\" started using the Microsoft Azure cloud to provide gene-sequencing supercomputing power, resulting in the service now known as Microsoft Genomics. Others focused on neonatal care, or better software for doctors, or improved ways to take patient measurements.  St. Jude researchers use Microsoft Genomics. St. Jude Children's Research Hospital  In all cases, Lee says, the key was for Microsoft to work closely with patients \u2014 as they did with St. Jude for Microsoft Genomics.  \"We appreciate that Microsoft is investing in genomic research and that they took the time to understand and appreciate our unique mission at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital: finding cures and saving children,\" St. Jude CIO Keith Perry told Business Insider via e-mail.  And for his part, Lee says the team has found a lot of \"inspiration\" in working directly with healthcare providers, and the patients they service. In working on Microsoft Genomics, he says, he and his team have made several pediatric cancer patients \u2014 renewing their drive to do better, faster. He says it's \"incredibly motivating.\"  Which is good, because he says Microsoft has \"found its way forward.\" There's no more floundering, he says, just promising movement in the right direction. For instance, Lee's group is now working on an intelligent chatbot for pharmacies that can help patients reorder prescriptions and answer questions about their medications.  As for himself, Lee describes himself as a \"second-year grad student\" \u2014 he's accumulated enough knowledge in the healthcare space to understand what the experts on his team are talking about and make decisions, but not enough to weigh in and participate in the research himself.  Still, he says, he's learning fast. And if he hasn't quite found dry land, he says he's beyond just treading water.  \"I haven't drowned yet,\" says Lee.", "stock": "MSFT", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-28", "source": "business-insider", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/peter-lee-microsoft-research-healthcare-next-interview-2018-2"}, {"article": "FILE PHOTO - A Microsoft logo is seen a day after Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) $26.2 billion purchase of LinkedIn Corp (LNKD.N), in Los Angeles Thomson Reuters By Dan Levine and Salvador Rodriguez  SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A senior executive said Microsoft Corp thoroughly investigates issues raised by women in the workplace and fired about 20 employees last year over complaints of sexual harassment as the company seeks to counter claims that it treats female workers unfairly.  In an email to employees publicly released late on Thursday, Microsoft Chief People Officer Kathleen Hogan said Microsoft had 83 harassment complaints in 2017 out of a U.S.-based workforce of over 65,000 employees.  Nearly 50 percent were found to be supported at least in part following an investigation, she said, and more than half of those resulted in the termination of an employee who engaged in unacceptable behavior.  The unusual publication of such data comes as the world's largest software company is defending a lawsuit which alleges it systematically denied pay raises or promotions to women. Microsoft denies it has ever had such a policy.  The lawsuit, filed in Seattle federal court in 2015, is attracting wider attention after a series of powerful men have left or been fired from their jobs in entertainment, the media and politics for sexual misconduct.  Microsoft also investigated 84 complaints of gender discrimination last year, Hogan said, and found around 10 percent of those to be supported at least in part.  Earlier this week, Reuters reported on the contents of unsealed court documents which showed that out of 118 gender discrimination complaints filed by women in U.S.-based technical jobs at Microsoft between 2010 and 2016, only one was deemed \"founded\" by the company.  Attorneys for the women described the number of complaints as \"shocking\" in the court filings, and said the response by Microsoft's investigations team was \"lackluster.\"  Hogan's email on Thursday linked to the Reuters story and said the numbers cited by plaintiffs were misleading.  \"Reports that we rarely reach a conclusion in favor of the complainant are based on a faulty reading of a partial data set,\" Hogan wrote.  Hogan's email did not provide additional figures about the time period cited in the court documents.  The plaintiffs based their numbers on documents disclosed by Microsoft during pre-trial discovery in the lawsuit. Kelly Dermody, an attorney for the plaintiffs, declined to comment on Hogan's email.  Alaina Percival, chief executive of Women Who Code, an organization that helps companies increase their number of women developers, said publicly releasing this kind of data can help businesses learn from each other about the best ways to handle sexual harassment and gender discrimination.  \"I think other tech companies should follow suit, and I would expect to see that happen,\" Percival said.

On Monday, a court issued a temporary restraining order which prevents McIntyre from working at Microsoft until further notice.  Using Microsoft's own arguments from a previous lawsuit, IBM is arguing that its diversity strategy is both confidential and \"potentially damaging\" if shared with its competitors.  Tech companies have a less than stellar record hiring women and minorities. But these companies will apparently do whatever it takes \u2014 including launching a legal fight \u2014 to hire one type of person: a Chief Diversity Officer.  IBM is suing its former top diversity officer Lindsay-Rae McIntyre after she got poached by Microsoft, in a case that could prove just how important diversity, recruitment, and retention has become for tech companies.  McIntyre, who joined IBM in 2006, was named chief diversity officer of Microsoft on Sunday, after serving in the same role and as VP of human resources at IBM. IBM, in its complaint, argues that McIntyree had access to diversity data, strategies, methodologies and initiatives that are confidential, and that she \"will use, rely on or divulge\" these strategies in her new role.  On Monday, IBM was granted a temporary restraining order in New York federal court, which prevents McIntyre from working for Microsoft until the court decides otherwise.  \"McIntyre was at the center of highly confidential and competitively sensitive information that has fueled IBM's success in these areas,\" a representative for IBM said in a statement. \"While we understand Microsoft's need to deal with mounting criticism of its record on diversity, IBM intends to fully enforce Ms. McIntyre's non-compete agreement to protect our competitive information.\"  IBM is using another Microsoft lawsuit to argue its case  At the heart of IBM's complaint is an on-going lawsuit from 2015, Moussouris v. Microsoft Corporation. The lawsuit alleges that Microsoft systematically discriminated against women in technical and engineering roles at the company when it came to evaluations, pay, and promotions.  The briefings for that lawsuit wrapped up on February 9. Now it is up to the courts to decide whether or not the case has class-action status.  As part of its non-compete case, IBM is looking to use Microsoft's own legal arguments from the Moussouris lawsuit to make its own point.  In April 2017, to prevent certain information from being released publicly in the discovery process, Microsoft argued that such diversity data is \"not merely confidential, but so sensitive and potentially damaging to Microsoft if revealed to its competitors (e.g., IBM), that the court should take the extraordinary measure of putting the information under seal,\" according to IBM's complaint.  Microsoft ultimately got some of the documents in the case sealed, and others released with redactions.  In its official response to IBM, Microsoft argued that enforcing McIntyre's non-compete agreement is \"draconian,\" as McIntyre has promised not to share confidential information with Microsoft.  It's worth noting that IBM's employee ranks are not a paragon of diversity: According to IBM's website, women comprised 31.8% of its global workforce in 2016.", "stock": "MSFT", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-12", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-hired-chief-diversity-officer-ibm-suing-2018-2"}, {"article": ".

Business Insider  To understand Peggy Johnson and the qualities that have made her successful, you have to know about her family. She was the 14th of 15 kids. As a child she was a quiet listener who learned to read her siblings' facial expressions from the kitchen countertop (with so many people, her chair wouldn't fit around the family table). Eventually Johnson followed some of her brothers and sisters to San Diego State University, where she started studying business, even though she really loved math and science. It was there that a chance encounter changed her life's trajectory.  Peggy Johnson: My parents had two rules: You had to go to college, and you had to pay for it yourself. So we all did. I was delivering mail and happened to deliver mail to the engineering department one day. Two ladies at the end of this long hallway with linoleum floors could hear me coming, and they were super excited to see me \u2014 like more excited than they should've been just because I was delivering mail.  It was because they thought I was there to ask about engineering. And they were disappointed. They said, \"We thought you wanted to know something about the School of Engineering.\" I said, \"Nope \u2014 just delivering the mail.\" They said, \"Well, do you know anything about engineering?,\" and I said, \"You know, absolutely nothing.\"  No one had ever really talked to me about engineering, and so they asked me the same question, \"Do you like math and science?\" I said, \"I love it.\" They just started to work on me, and after 15 to 20 minutes I felt, like, \"You know, this might be something I want to do.\"  The next day I changed my major to engineering \u2014 yeah, to electrical engineering.  Alyson Shontell: Wow.  Johnson: I credit those two ladies. They just, you know, worked on me and changed my mind.  Shontell: They changed your life.  Johnson: My life. The whole trajectory of my life really changed in that conversation.  Shontell: So you wound up getting a job at GE after this great electrical-engineering major. And you spent a couple years there.  Johnson: Yeah, I started as an intern while I was still at school, and again, San Diego State put me on a great course because they had a number of great internship opportunities, and this area of General Electric was in their military electronics division. I worked on anti-submarine warfare for surface ships. So it sounds very interesting, I'm sure. You want to know more about that, but I can't say anything because I had a clearance.  But it was a job I might still be in today if not for it seemed like it was going to move to Syracuse, New York, and of course I was in San Diego, California, but I didn't want to move, and well, \"I've got to look for a job here in San Diego,\" and ended up saying no to GE.  Johnson spent 25 years working her way up the ladder  Johnson worked at Qualcomm for 25 years on both the technical engineering side and the business side. Thomson Reuters  Shontell: Is that when you went to Qualcomm?  Johnson: Yes, and I just answered an ad in the newspaper, which they don't do anymore. You probably never even heard of that, but yes, that's how you used to get jobs, look through the newspaper.  Shontell: In the classifieds.  Johnson: The classifieds, and there it was. It was this new company, and they were hiring, and my husband had had an internship at the predecessor to Qualcomm, called Linkabit. He said, \"You know, Irwin Jacobs is an amazing man.\" He had owned and been in Linkabit, and he said, \"I don't know what Qualcomm does, but I think you should \u2014 \"  Shontell: He's the founder of Qualcomm?  Johnson: Irwin Jacobs is, yeah. And so prodded by my husband, who was at that time pursuing his master's degree, and we were married, and one of us needed to work, and that was me. So I went in, had an interview. Hardest interview of my life, and ended up getting the job, and stayed there for 25 years.  Shontell: Yeah, it's incredible. But while you had a long career there, at first it seemed as if you were soft-spoken and it was hard to kind of get your point across in a loud room with those guys.  Johnson: It was.  And I'm soft-spoken probably going back to the family experience. Number 14 out of 15 wasn't an enviable position to be in. You were just one of so many voices at the table, and I was one who had to sit at the side table. So I was at the kids' table until I was, like, 24 years old.  So I was more of a listener, and I was quiet largely because I couldn't ever really break in to that chaos at the big table. But I was a listener and I would watch people, and I would try to understand their mood. Those skills were what I brought into my job at Qualcomm, and maybe not great skills, because when I got to Qualcomm the expectation really at that time was, \"You need to speak up more. You need to be more assertive in meetings. We want to hear from you more.\" Whenever I did that, whenever I tried to be what I wasn't, it didn't really turn out very well, and I didn't feel very authentic, and in fact people would kind of look at me \u2014 \"Why is she being so assertive and aggressive here? That's not like her.\" And it wasn't. It wasn't my authentic self.  So pretty much I had decided, \"I think I have to leave the industry, the company. I'm just not suited for this.\" My manager at the time said, \"No, we are going to figure this out. You're going to stay right where you are,\" and really I credit him for making a lot of changes in the HR department at the time because we were ranked by certain attributes that I didn't have. So I remember being marked off for not being aggressive and assertive in meetings, and he said, \"We are going to change this, and we are going to make sure we have a broader set of qualities that we're looking for.\" Things like teamwork and being collaborative, and he really pushed. It was early, early days, and things changed from that point on. Once I was able to be my more authentic self I felt like that's when my career really took off. I was just my own voice.  Shontell: Yes, so he sort of gave you permission to be yourself and helped you find your own leadership style.  Johnson: He did, yes. I always credit him for that because I might have just left like, I think, a lot of women did at the time. They just didn't feel comfortable and it didn't feel like a very inclusive environment, and he helped change that.  Shontell: So you go on to stay for many, many more years at Qualcomm \u2014 25 years.  Johnson: Yes.  Shontell: What made you so dedicated to that one company?  Johnson: Right, yes. So first of all, Qualcomm's a great company, and they gave me the opportunity to really thrive in a number of roles. So I was an engineer to start with, and I was in the engineering department for several years. Then I had been going out on business trips because we needed to explain the product to the industry we were selling into, and on one of the flights home the general manager happens to be sitting next to me and he said, \"I don't understand. Why don't you just come over to the business side? You really seem to love doing that, and I like the way you translate the technical world into the business world. I think you could be well suited for that.\"  And I thought, \"Well, thank you very much but no, thank you. I'm an engineer.\" I identified with being an engineer, and I remember thinking engineering at that time at Qualcomm was in one building, and all the business people were in the other building, and we made fun of them all the time because they dressed up, and we got to wear our Qualcomm shirts and jeans. We thought we didn't want to have anything to do with that world, but it started to weigh on me, and probably four or five weeks went by, and I remember sitting at our holiday party, and all of sudden I had one of those aha moments, and it was:\" \"You need to do this. You need to make that leap.\" Because while I liked what I did, I loved being in front of the customer. So I did, and I moved over into program management, which is sort of a technical and business role, and that was really the start of my business career at Qualcomm.  Shontell: So you switched from engineering to the business-development side, and that's when things really took off.  Johnson: Yeah, and I think part of it was the time. It was early days of the mobile phones. We were making the digital standard that was eventually embedded into mobile phones in the US, and so everything was exciting and new. We were forging new paths, and it was such a great time to be at the start of a business. None of us had any idea what it would turn into. I don't think any of us at that time envisioned that everybody would be carrying cellphones. I mean, we thought, \"That'll be a good business. Maybe a few million of those will sell.\" So it was fun to be there at the start of that, but I had great managers along the way, and any time I wanted to do something different they really supported me.  Shontell: And switching careers isn't easy. I mean, it's a big risk.  Johnson: Exactly. It is, and you're not quite sure, and if it doesn't work out, can I go back? Once I switched over I had to learn a lot. Clearly I didn't have a business degree, and a lot of it was on-the-job learning, but I had some great mentors and folks who leaned in and helped me. And I just loved every hat I wore after that point, until I moved on to Microsoft from Qualcomm.  How Johnson decided to make the leap and start a new career at Microsoft  Johnson was recruited by Satya Nadella as his first big hire after becoming Microsoft's CEO in 2014. Microsoft  Shontell: It sounds like you had a great setup. You established yourself through the ranks, had great mentorship. So Microsoft calls. You'd been rejecting other calls before, kind of just hanging up the phone on recruiters. What was it about Microsoft?  Johnson: Well, I wouldn't call them back. I wouldn't hang up on them.  Shontell: OK: You were polite about it.  Johnson: That's it. But it was one of those interesting times. I hadn't ever called any back because everything was great at Qualcomm. I loved it, and also I was living in San Diego, my family was there. Everything was fantastic, but at the time of the industry Satya had just taken over, Satya Nadella, as CEO of Microsoft. We did business with Microsoft. We sold them chips, and so we know, of course, of Microsoft. We didn't really know Satya, and one of the first things he did is he decided to put Office on IOS and Android phones, and that blew us away. I mean, probably not just us in Qualcomm, but the industry.  That was quite a bold move, and so when I got the call from Microsoft they said, \"Well, it's a job reporting to Satya. You'd be running business development.\" I thought, \"I just want to call back to understand what it's about. The company seems to be in this big transition, and I just want to learn a little bit basically.\" But of course was never going to go anywhere. I lived in San Diego there wasn't any question that I was going anywhere. When I called back I was just drawn in, and eventually I had a conversation with Satya.  Shontell: He called you on a Saturday.  Johnson: He did, yeah. He did, and so I was chatting with him, and again it was kind of like another aha moment. He was talking about his world view of a mobile-first, cloud-first world, and all of a sudden it just connected with me because obviously I'd been living in a mobile-first world, a wireless world. That was what I knew inside and out. I felt very comfortable in that world. Then when data left the phone it went off to that thing called the cloud and Qualcomm didn't have much to do with that. As he was talking about this idea of ambient computing and having intelligence everywhere it just clicked with me that this is something I need to know more about, and I wanted to understand more about Satya's vision, and eventually took a trip to Seattle.  I remember getting on the plane in San Diego feeling like, \"I hope nobody sees me because I've never done this before. I'm gonna go visit another company for a job possibly.\" And had a chance to meet the rest of the management team, and then to sit down with Satya. His vision to empower every person and organization on the planet, to achieve more, it just struck me, and it resonated with me, and I ended up saying yes, making the move with my family. We had only one child at home at that time, and so we moved up to Seattle, where I live today.  Shontell: He's done incredible things with Microsoft.  Johnson: He has, absolutely.  Shontell: What's he like to work with?  Johnson: Very empathetic. He's a listener. He's a learner. Curious. We're allowed to fail, learn from it, but it's super important. He's really changed the company at its core, and we are following a growth mindset, which he introduced to the company, and I feel like whenever we sort of get off path a little bit, we come back to the growth mindset. We'll say, \"Are we exhibiting a growth mindset here?\" You know? It's easy to say no. Any idea you can have 10 nos. It's a lot harder to say yes. So the growth mindset allows us to push boarders a little bit, and to say yes more, try things out, fail fast. I believe it's changed the core of the company, and I hear that from others outside, which is very gratifying. But what's so exciting is that the campus is energized, and it's just been a wild, crazy, fun ride for the last three years.  What it takes to be Microsoft's deal-maker-in-chief  As executive vice president for business development, Johnson has overseen more than 40 investments, including the $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn. REUTERS/Robert Galbraith  Shontell: So it's been three years. You've done a lot. One thing that stands out: You worked with a big team on the LinkedIn deal. Microsoft bought LinkedIn for $26 billion-plus.  Johnson: Yeah: $26 billion.  Shontell: So how does a $26 billion deal happen? How long did it take? What happens behind the scenes? Because most of us don't get to that level.  Johnson: It takes an army, for sure. I mean, I would say the evolution of an acquisition that big has to go through many, many gates, and it starts with sort of conversations. It starts with a strategy. \"Are we the better owners?\" Looking at it from all different angles.  Clearly, one of that size needs to be assessed fully, and we have fantastic teams across the company who are so good at that assessment. Also, the engagement, once we decided to make the decision to go forward, the engagement with the company, the integration part, which is super important. You can make all of the great strategic assessments ahead of time, but if you can't integrate well after, you've lost a lot of money. The teams at Microsoft are just first class at that.  Shontell: So is it a 10-month process? Faster?  Johnson: I can't remember. There were conversations for a long period of time, but then once we sort of pulled the trigger, I want to say \u2014 I don't know \u2014 maybe it was somewhere between six and 12 months. I can't quite remember from the time of the first conversations until we announced that we were going to proceed with an acquisition.  Shontell: When I saw the headline, and we were writing it on Business Insider, it was like, \"Oh, whoa. This is a huge deal.\" It went totally under the radar. You didn't get scooped.  Johnson: Another thing that I think we did a very good job on ... because obviously a team that size inside the company did a very good job of keeping things quiet on both sides. Including the transactional folks in between. So all of that had rolled out very, very well. It was sort of the example of how you'd like to do an acquisition.  Shontell: I'm sure you say no, of course, much more than you say yes. One that stands out is Slack, I think, was an opportunity to buy, and I think Microsoft ultimately passed, along with some others. On a deal like that, how do you weigh it?  Johnson: Well, without commenting specifically on Slack, I would say for any acquisition we ask that question, \"Are we the better owners? Does it fulfill a strategic gap that we have?\" Because many times a partnership is even better oftentimes because to be an owner you have to be all in, but if a partnership can work to fill a gap, we'll go that route. Sometimes we'll make an investment in a company because they're on a quicker path to filling a gap, but they may need a little help in the form of resources to get there. Then finally if the right answer is, \"Yes, we are the better owners,\" we'll go the full way and go forward with an acquisition.  So we do sort of an assessment that way, and we try to be very, very disciplined, and stick to our core ambitions, and not go too far off of that, because that's where you get into trouble. So we talk ourselves in and out of things often.  Johnson explains how to be a good leader  Johnson learned a lot of leadership skills growing up in a family with 15 children. Microsoft  Shontell: You've said that prioritization is a skill that you learned really early on. Do you have tips? How do you figure out, in a job as huge as yours \u2014 I'm sure you have a million different things that you could be doing \u2014 how do you focus, and how do you zero in on the right things?  Johnson: Well, I think I learned it from my mom, who is probably the program-manager-in-chief to run a house like that. Because one of the things she used to say is, \"We may have 15 kids, but we're not gonna be a messy house. When people come in the house we don't want them to say, 'Oh yeah, this is what I thought a house with 15 kids would look like.'\" So she was very disciplined. She made lists \u2014 and I love lists \u2014 and checking things off the list always feels good.  So I learned sort of that prioritization from my mom, and that it's not important to get everything on the list done but really to make sure that you set out in the morning to get the top ones done. That's what your focus should be. You shouldn't be stressed that you didn't get to the bottom of the list. She was very good at that.  Shontell: Another skill of yours is you're great, from what I've heard your coworkers say, you're great at building these relationships that last a long time. Especially in that business \u2014 it's so critical to have that. How do you do that? What are your tips for building long-lasting work and general life relationships?  Johnson: I think it goes back to that family table when I was the listener in the room, and that is something that is probably a little bit underrated, but for me has been, I feel like, the core of my leadership abilities is the ability to listen, and to deeply listen, and to understand and put myself in the other person's shoes. Once you do that you can solve whatever problem there is on the table whether it's a business problem or a technical problem, I think, more quickly having that ability to put yourself on the other side.  Shontell: Then I have a kind of more general landscape question. I think someone asked you once what you thought the biggest issue women face in the workforce is, and you said harassment. Certainly we've seen a lot of stories about that this year, Harvey Weinstein on up. What do you think we can do better? How do you think we can fix it? What have you seen that makes you say that?  Johnson: Well, I just feel like you should be able to have a respectful work environment, because if you do you'll be your best self. You'll bring your best self to work, and over the years there was always that whispering at work when there was people you avoided because you didn't want a comment about your dress or something, and I think about all of the cycles that my friends and I would share, you know, \"Don't go by that person's office. Go the long way around.\" Those cycles could have been put to a lot better use. So there's kind of a business reason to stop this, and there's obviously all of the other reasons that we've been talking about since the #MeToo movement started, but there's also a basic business reason. We could be so much more productive if we didn't have to spend all those cycles sort of fending off that sometimes subtle harassment, but it sort of exists there, and if we can together say, \"Let's just have an inclusive, respectful environment at work,\" and teach our boys and our girls, I think we'll be far more productive. We'll be our best selves. We'll bring our best selves to work because we'll know we'll be in a comfortable environment.  Shontell: You've had an incredible career, many years ahead of it still, but the point that you've gotten to is just really inspiring. If you're looking back or you're giving someone advice who's just starting their career, what do you wish you had known then, and what would you advise someone who wants to rise to the top like you have?  Johnson: Well, I think the best advice I ever got was just to be myself, and I think once I settled into who I am, I'm quiet, I'm somewhat introverted, and decided that's OK, it's OK to be who I am. Then my career took off. So for someone starting I would say, \"Be who you are. If you are aggressive and assertive that's fine, too. Just embrace who you are because we really need that diversity of thought at work. We don't need a bunch of Peggy Johnsons of any one type. We really need the sort of the mix and the blend of all the different opinions and voices.\" That I think would be good advice for someone just stepping into their career.  Shontell: Thank you so much, Peggy. It's really been fun.  Johnson: Thank you, Alyson. Thanks for having me. I appreciate it.", "stock": "MSFT", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-02", "source": "business-insider", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/peggy-johnson-microsoft-linkedin-interview-2018-2"}, {"article": "A Microsoft logo is seen in Los Angeles Thomson Reuters By Salvador Rodriguez  SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp on Monday said 200,000 organizations are now using Teams, its year-old workplace collaboration software, up from 125,000 in September, a sign the company may be making some progress in its battle with Slack Technologies Inc.  Microsoft also announced a slate of new features for Teams, including instant language translation.  Slack's emergence as a popular platform for workplace messaging and document-sharing is a threat to Microsoft's long-standing dominance in office productivity software.  Teams now comes bundled with Microsoft Office 365 as the company battles rival offerings from companies including privately-held Slack, Alphabet Inc's Google , Atlassian Corp PLC , Cisco Systems Inc and Facebook Inc .  \"These group messaging tools go far beyond just chat and are becoming a central hub for integrating a variety of business applications into a single user interface,\" said Alan Lepofsky, analyst with Constellation Research. \"They are essentially the new inbox.\"  Microsoft has raced to make Teams a viable competitor after realizing several years ago that Slack was making inroads with big customers. A former Microsoft Office executive told Reuters that learning of the widespread adoption of Slack at Walt Disney Co in early 2015 was an especially important wake-up call.  \"It's one thing when an app gains traction with startups in Silicon Valley, that happens all the time,\" said the former employee, who asked not to be named. \"But it's another when your biggest, longest-tenured customers start adopting it, and then you realize you have to respond.\"  San Francisco-based Slack said in September that it had 6 million daily users and more than 50,000 paying teams. It has not published new figures since then.  Microsoft has not released comparable figures for Teams.  Slack has a big lead when it comes to third-party applications, with more than 1,000 compared to 250 for Teams.  Teams is still not as simple to use as Slack and lacks the depth of functionality, said Wayne Kurtzman, an analyst with the research firm IDC.  \"As great as Microsoft Teams has done in the past year, it's still not as mature of a product,\" Kurtzman said.  Microsoft says it is gaining ground, pointing to customers such as Navistar, the manufacturer of trucks and buses. Navistar moved about a thousand employees onto Teams last year, choosing it over Slack due to its long-time relationship with Microsoft, said Terry Kline, Navistar chief information officer.  \"We looked at Slack, and we didn't see any significant advantage,\" Kline told Reuters in a phone interview.  The move has reduced the company's use of email by 3 percent, he added.  Other Teams customers include Macy's, General Motors, General Electric, ConocoPhillips and Nascar, according to Microsoft.  \"It's surprised all of us how extremely well it's doing,\" Microsoft Teams General Manager Lori Wright told Reuters.

Microsoft has been losing ground to other cloud computing and enterprise software-as-a-service competitors, namely Amazon, but the company could leverage LinkedIn and similarly aggressive acquisitions to kick the unit into high gear, one analyst says.  \"Given that we believe Microsoft feels emboldened with the success of LinkedIn, we think such a renewed focus on SaaS applications could include M&A,\" BMO Capital Markets analyst Keith Bachman said in a note to clients Thursday. \"One area that we think could be a new growth opportunity within the SaaS market is in HCM, or talent management in particular, which would further leverage LinkedIn.\"  Microsoft purchased LinkedIn for $26.2 billion in June 2016.

If your business is already using cloud storage from one of those three companies, Microsoft will give you OneDrive for free for the duration of your contract with them.  The fine print: Your company needs to have more than 500 users, and you can't already be a customer of OneDrive or the Office 365 cloud productivity suite.  Google, Box, and Dropbox, be warned: Microsoft is coming for your customers.  On Tuesday, Microsoft announced a new offer to entice companies to use its OneDrive cloud storage service. If you're a business that's already using any of those three competitors, Microsoft will give you its OneDrive for Business service for free until your contract with the other company ends.  The promotional offer comes with some caveats: You have to commit to 500 seats or more, meaning small businesses won't really be able to take advantage. You have to not already be a customer of OneDrive, or of the Microsoft Office 365 productivity suite. And the deal is only good through June 18th.  The big idea is to give customers a taste of what Microsoft can offer, without having to worry about their existing commitments to those other vendors. Microsoft is confident enough that those big customers will sign on, it seems, that they're willing to swallow the cost. In general, Microsoft is seeing solid growth in its subscription cloud businesses, bolstering its confidence here.  As for why customers would want to make the change: Microsoft is touting the deep integrations between its own OneDrive service and Microsoft Office. While Microsoft Office is compatible with cloud storage from those other companies to a certain degree, there are some special features that Microsoft reserves for its own offerings.  For instance, you need OneDrive if you want to have multiple authors simultaneously work on a single Office document in real-time from the computer or smartphone apps. And OneDrive integrates with other Microsoft apps like the team portal SharePoint, so files stay in sync across the suite.  Plus, Microsoft Global Senior Director Seth Patton hypes up the security of OneDrive, saying that it means most customers' most stringent requirements.  \"That's a pretty big deal,\" Patton tells Business Insider.  Still, with this offer, Microsoft might find itself preaching to the choir somewhat. While Box, Dropbox, and Google's G Suite certainly have a certain number of large-enterprise customers, they're mostly known for appealing to smaller and midsize businesses.  Microsoft is already generally considered to be the leader in large companies, given the fact that its Office suite is, and remains, the gold standard in the productivity market. Still, with analysts urging Dropbox to pursue an enterprise-focused strategy ahead of its purported IPO, perhaps Microsoft is just trying to consolidate its lead ahead of time.  After this offer expires, customer will have to pay for OneDrive for Business like usual. Plans start at $5 per user per month, or else you could opt in for a $12.50 per user per month subscription to the Office 365 cloud productivity suite \u2014 at which point you'd get access to all of the Office applications, like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, too.", "stock": "MSFT", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-06", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-has-a-new-plan-to-steal-google-dropbox-and-box-customers-2018-2"}, {"article": "Getty Images/Stephen Brashear  Microsoft's stock fell on Thursday morning after the company reported modest quarterly earnings.  Investors were concerned they did not see enough accelerated growth, and that profits would not be returned in the form of increased buybacks or dividends.  Watch Microsoft's stock move in real time here.    Shares of Microsoft slipped after the company reported quarterly profits that modestly beat expectations, but failed to enthuse investors.  Microsoft was down 1.45% at $93.63 in pre-market trading on Thursday.  Though Microsoft reported better-than-expected earnings of $0.96 a share on revenue of $28.92 billion, the company was also hit with a one-time charge of $13.8 billion due to the newly-passed tax law.  The \"lack of accelerated capital return\" and the newly guided corporate tax rate below 21% \"may modestly disappoint,\" said RBC Analyst Ross MacMillan. He said that the technology company remains focused on reinvesting in growth rather than returning profits, in the form of a buyback or special dividend, to investors.  Yet revenues from Microsoft's Productivity and Business Processes segment, which includes Microsoft Office, the Office 365 cloud suite, and LinkedIn, grew 25% year-over-year and its Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes its Azure platform, grew 15% during the same period. Revenue from its personal computing segment posted modest growth of 2%.  Still, MacMillan raised his price target to $105, up 12% from its current price.  He believes that Microsoft could see more upside with an acceleration of Azure and LinkedIn services and offerings, the wider adoption of the Azure Stack, Microsoft's hybrid cloud platform, and a markedly improved commercial PC market, as well as improved Windows performance.

Following the hire, Microsoft says it will bring some of the features Chalkup had built to the Microsoft Teams for Education product experience.  Chalkup was founded in 2013 by CEO Justin Chando, who\u2019s joining Microsoft as a result of this deal, and CTO Tim Costa, who left Chalkup in 2015.  The startup offered a classroom collaboration platform where teachers could share resources and assignments with students and could discuss course topics, among other things. The company says educators and students from 1 in 3 universities and 1 in 5 high schools in the U.S. had used Chalkup at some point.  However, with the arrival of Microsoft Teams for Education in March 2017, Chalkup faced a serious competitor \u2013 and one that comes bundled with Microsoft Office 365 for Education \u2013 for free.  As the two products compete in the same space \u2013 collaboration software for educators and students, both Microsoft and Chalkup realized they may do better to join forces.  \u201cIn spending time with the amazing people at Microsoft, it was clear that we were completely aligned in our mission for connecting classrooms, sparking student collaboration, and finding new and innovative ways to work together. We knew Microsoft would be a great fit and we\u2019re thrilled for what the future holds for our customers,\u201d said Chando, in the official announcement.  Moving forward, Chalkup says some of its best-loved features will be integrated into Microsoft Teams. However, the companies so far have only disclosed one that\u2019s definitely making the transition: Chalkup\u2019s criteria-based grading rubrics that let teachers give students feedback on their work.  Chalkup\u2019s product is not immediately shutting down, as that would be disruptive in the middle of the school year. Instead, the software will remain available until June 30, 2018. It will also soon add the ability for users to export their course information and move to Microsoft Teams.  Chalkup itself was not a large company \u2013 one founder had left, and it had only raised a small seed round, according to Crunchbase. But Chalkup remained online all these years by being very capital efficient, and had built software that was in demand in the classroom, and as an acquisition target. In fact, the company had multiple acquisition* offers, we understand. (Perhaps one was from Google, given Chalkup\u2019s integrations there?)  Investors described the exit to Microsoft as a great outcome, as well.  Microsoft has requested this should not be characterized as an acquisition \u2013 only a hiring. However, we confirmed money exchanged hands here, so it\u2019s a bit of hair splitting on Microsoft\u2019s part.  \u201cJustin built one of the first education platforms that students really loved to use,\u201d said Wayne Chang, who had invested in the startup alongside Jeff Seibert. (Both had directly invested, but not on behalf of Baseline, where they are LPs). \u201cAnd Jeff and I couldn\u2019t be more excited that Chalkup is joining Microsoft and bringing that approach to schools and classrooms everywhere.\u201d  Today\u2019s news follows shortly after Microsoft Teams\u2019 larger product received its biggest update to date. Last month, Microsoft announced a slew of new features for its Slack competitor, including new app integrations, an app store, improved search and discovery features, and new commands.  Teams\u2019 adoption has been steadily growing. Last September, Microsoft said that 125,000 organizations had adopted the software, but didn\u2019t speak to how many users it has. However, Slack had said around the same time that it had grown to 6 million daily users, 9 million weekly users, and had passed 50,000 paid teams earlier in the year.  *Correction, 2/13/2018 1:30 PM ET: Microsoft says it does not characterize this deal as an acquisition; post updated to reflect this.  \u201cMicrosoft\u2019s goal is always to deliver the most comprehensive and time-saving products for teachers and believe Justin will be a tremendous asset to help Microsoft bring added value to Microsoft Teams,\u201d a spokesperson said.", "stock": "MSFT", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-13", "source": "techcrunch", "url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/02/13/microsoft-acquires-classroom-collaboration-startup-chalkup-to-expand-microsoft-teams/"}, {"article": "Microsoft Cognitive Services is home to the company\u2019s hosted artificial intelligence algorithms. Today, the company announced advances to several Cognitive Services tools including Microsoft Custom Vision Service, the Face API and Bing Entity Search .  Joseph Sirosh, who leads the Microsoft\u2019s cloud AI efforts, defined Microsoft Cognitive Services in a company blog post announcing the enhancements, as \u201ca collection of cloud-hosted APIs that let developers easily add AI capabilities for vision, speech, language, knowledge and search into applications, across devices and platforms such as iOS, Android and Windows.\u201d These are distinct from other Azure AI services, which are designed for developers who are more hands-on, DIY types.  The idea is to put these kinds of advanced artificial intelligence tools within reach of data scientists, developers and any other interested parties without any of the normal heavy lifting required to build models and get results with the myriad of testing phases that are typically involved in these types of exercises.  For starters, the company is moving the Custom Vision Service from free preview to paid preview, which is the final step before becoming generally available. Sirosh writes that this service helps \u201cdevelopers to easily train a classifier with their own data, export the models and embed these custom classifiers directly in their applications, and run it offline in real time on iOS, Android and many other edge devices.\u201d  Andy Hickl, who works in the Cognitive Services group as principal group program manager, says the tool is designed to help companies identify similar entities in an automated way such as not only recognizing that a particular picture is a dog, but that\u2019s it\u2019s a specific kind of dog or a dog that belongs to a particular person.  The Face API, which is generally available as of today, helps identify a specific person from a large group of people in an automated way. With today\u2019s release the tool allows developers to create groups of up to a million people. Hickl says this is significant because up until now, many face recognition algorithms could only recognize a handful of faces, useful as far as it goes, but not truly scalable like this, he pointed out.  Finally, the Bing Entity Search algorithm enables developers to embed Bing search results in any application. So for example, you could retrieve search results within any tool narrowed down by any Bing entity such as image or website.

The updates were spotted by Windows Central \u2014 after all, Microsoft\u2019s not exactly broadcasting the new SKUs.

Xiaomi and Microsoft have signed a Strategic Framework Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to work more closely in the areas of cloud computing, AI (including Microsoft\u2019s Cortana business) and hardware.  To date, Xiaomi has largely focused its mobile phone and wider device strategy in Asia Pacific, where Gartner revealed yesterday that it (and Huawei) were the only two vendors to increase their market shares at a time of general decline. This deal could point to how Xiaomi is looking to raise its game in the West, specifically in the US, especially as it eyes up an IPO that has been reported to potentially value the company at $100 billion.  On the side of Microsoft, it\u2019s particularly interesting given that the company has largely pulled back on a lot of its hardware efforts, and has visibly had some major stumbles in this area especially in mobile \u2014 most recently with its failure to take on and grow the Nokia mobile business and Windows Mobile.  It\u2019s also notable that we\u2019re heading into Mobile World Congress, the mobile confab in Barcelona. We understand neither Xiaomi nor Microsoft are planning any news events this year although both have been more noisy in years past.  Understanding that mobile isn\u2019t an area that Microsoft can quite step away from altogether, it seems that the company is going to have one more go now on with a different partner (one that is still on the rise) and a different approach.  \u201cXiaomi is one of the most innovative companies in China, and it is becoming increasingly popular in various markets around the world,\u201d said Harry Shum, EVP of Microsoft\u2019s Artificial Intelligence and Research Group, in a statement. \u201cMicrosoft\u2019s unique strengths and experience in AI, as well as our products like Azure, will enable Xiaomi to develop more cutting-edge technology for everyone around the world.\u201d  \u201cMicrosoft has been a great partner and we are delighted to see both companies deepening this relationship with this strategic MoU,\u201d Wang Xiang, Global Senior Vice President and Head of International Business, Xiaomi, added in his statement. \u201cXiaomi\u2019s mission is to deliver innovation to everyone around the world. By collaborating with Microsoft on multiple technology areas, Xiaomi will accelerate our pace to bring more exciting products and services to our users. At the same time, this partnership would allow Microsoft to reach more users around the world who are using Xiaomi products.\u201d  The deal covers four major areas of services for the two companies:  Cloud support will include Xiaomi using Microsoft Azure for data storage, bandwidth and computing and other cloud services. Meanwhile, Xiaomi\u2019s efforts in laptops and \u201claptop-style devices\u201d that run Windows will be co-marketed by Microsoft. Then Microsoft is also going to be talking with Xiaomi on how to improve collaboration on AI-powered speakers using Cortana. It\u2019s not clear if this will involve a refashioning of Xioami\u2019s first smart speaker, the MI AI, which was launched in July 2017 for less than $50 and based on its MIUI forked-Android operating system; or a whole new range of devices.

This includes features that will allow users to record, transcribe and save meetings to the cloud, integrations with voice assistant Cortana, inline message translation and several others.  The added integration with Cortana\u2019s voice assistance could give Microsoft an edge in its battle with Slack, given the increasing importance of voice-based computing in the workplace and within business productivity applications.  Microsoft and Amazon announced last year their voice assistants, Cortana and Alexa, would work together, for example. Meanwhile, companies \u2014 including Microsoft \u2014 have been working to make their applications and services work well with voice assistants given the potential of voice computing in the workplace.  According to Microsoft, Cortana voice integrations for Teams-enabled devices will launch later this year, allowing users to easily make a call, join a meeting or add people to meetings using natural, spoken language. What\u2019s more, these voice capabilities will extend to IP phones and conference room devices, as well.  This feature alone could be a big selling point for Microsoft Teams, but it\u2019s one of several the company announced are in the works.  Also coming in 2018 is cloud recording \u2014 another that takes advantages of advances in voice technology in recent years. Microsoft Teams will be able to record meetings with a click, then create an automatic transcription of what was said. Meeting attendees can choose to play back the meeting in full, or just a key part, using the transcription as reference.  This feature will also be advanced in the future to include facial recognition, so meeting remarks can be properly attributed.  Meeting transcription is an area other startups are working in, as well. For example, recently launched Otter is offering an automatic transcription tool for meetings, as is Voicera, which just landed $20 million for its automated note-taking assistant. (It wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see Slack snatch up a company like this in the future, to help it compete by way of native voice and transcription features.)  Microsoft is also promising inline messaging translations between languages in channels and chat; a background blur option for video calls (great for meetings from home offices); proximity detection for adding available Skype Room Systems to meetings; and mobile sharing in meetings.  This last item will allow attendees to share a live video stream, photo or screen share from their mobile device.  In addition to the planned features, Microsoft announced new enterprise-grade calling features arriving today, including consultative transfer and call delegation and federation. It\u2019s also now rolling out Direct Routing, which allows customers to integrate existing telephony infrastructure with Teams for calling.  Related to this, Teams is also now enabled across meeting room devices, including Microsoft Surface Hub; devices from new partners Lenovo and HP (which join Logitech, Crestron and Polycom); Skype Room Systems; new solutions from BlueJeans, Pexip and Polycom that will connect with Teams; new desk phones from AudioCodes and Yealink and new conference room phones from Crestron, Polycom and Yealink, all of which will run a native Teams app; and new mobile phone stations from Plantronics.  Microsoft today gave an update on Teams\u2019 traction, given it\u2019s now been a year since its worldwide debut. There are today 200,000 organizations in 181 markets and 39 languages on Teams, including A.P. Moller-Maersk, ConocoPhillips, Macy\u2019s, NASCAR, Navistar, RLH Corporation and Technicolor and, as of another announcement today, General Motors.

But here, the pictures are created by the computer, pixel by pixel, from scratch,\u201d explained Xiaodong He, a principal researcher and research manager in the Deep Learning Technology Center at Microsoft\u2019s research lab in Redmond, Washington, in Microsoft\u2019s announcement. \u201cThese birds may not exist in the real world \u2014 they are just an aspect of our computer\u2019s imagination of birds.\u201d  The bot is able to generate a variety of images, researchers say, including everything from \u201cordinary pastoral scenes,\u201d like those with grazing livestock, to the absurd \u2013 like \u201ca floating double-decker bus.\u201d  Microsoft says the bot was trained on datasets of paired images and captions, allowing it to understand how to match up words to images. It learned to draw a bird, for example, when the caption says \u201cbird,\u201d and it learned what a picture of a bird should look like.  \u201cThat is a fundamental reason why we believe a machine can learn,\u201d said He.  The drawing bot\u2019s technology consists of two machine learning models \u2013 one to generate images from text descriptions, and another that uses text descriptions to judge the authenticity of the generated images. The former tries to get fake pictures past the latter, but the latter doesn\u2019t want to be fooled. Combined, the two work together to create higher-quality images.  In particular, it\u2019s good at drawing images from more complex sentences. While other technology could draw a bird from a caption that said \u201cbird,\u201d for instance, the quality would decline if you told it to draw a bird with a green crown, yellow wings and red belly. Before, this would have led to a blurry \u201cgreenish-yellowish-reddish bird,\u201d Microsoft explains.  What\u2019s especially interesting is how the bot can fill in the blanks when specific details aren\u2019t mentioned \u2013 basically, it has a little common sense and imagination of its own, thanks to its training data. In the bird example, the bot will usually draw a bird sitting on a tree branch even if that\u2019s not stated in the text, because the images originally fed to it often showed something similar.  According to a recent research paper, this new bot represents a nearly three-fold boost in image quality compared to prior technology, Microsoft also notes.  This isn\u2019t the first technology to combine AI with art, of course.  The intersection of the two sometimes leads to fantastic results, such as when Google\u2019s artificial intelligence drew those trippy machine-generated images that got their own art show. Google also has a neural net that guesses what you\u2019re drawing and an automated drawing bot, and regularly details the research it\u2019s doing in helping machines learn how to draw.  Facebook, too, has worked on teaching neural networks to make small images of things like airplanes, cars and animals, and even creating your own Bitmoji-like avatar from a photo.  Nvidia researchers created computer-generated celebrities, using A.I.  And there have been a slew of recent advancements in this space from others, as well.  For Microsoft, teaching a bot to draw an image from text completes the circle of other work its been doing in this computer vision and natural language processing space.  This includes the development of CaptionBot which automatically writes photo captions, and a technology that can answer questions people ask about images, like the location or attributes of objects \u2013 things that can be helpful for blind people.  As to what purpose an AI artist may serve in the real world, Microsoft has some ideas.  It suggests the bot could act as a sketch assistant for painters or interior designers, or could be implemented as a tool for voice-activated photo refinement. (\u201cCortana, draw a bird,\u201d perhaps?)  Further down the road, He says that, with more computing power, the technology could possibly generate animated films from screenplays to reduce the manual labor required today from animators.  But the technology isn\u2019t there yet.  If you look closely at the images, they\u2019ll almost always have flaws that indicate they were created by machines, not humans \u2013 like birds with blue beaks or fruit stands with odd-shaped bananas (see above).

These different programs never quite told a cohesive story about Microsoft\u2019s commitment to startups, though. Now, however, the company is launching Microsoft for Startups, a program that aims to bring technology and marketing expertise to startups and that \u2014 maybe most importantly \u2014 includes a co-selling program that allows startups to piggyback on Microsoft\u2019s existing sales force.  In addition, Microsoft is tweaking some of its existing programs to better support the startups in its ecosystem.  In total, Microsoft is committing $500 million over the course of the next two years to run joint sales engagements and offer to startups access to technology and community spaces.  But let\u2019s get the bad news out of the way first: The number of credits for startups in the BizSpark and BizSpark Plus program will go down (though not for startups currently enrolled in these programs).

Microsoft currently operates these in Redmond, Seattle, San Francisco and New York. It\u2019s now looking to open new ones in London, Sydney, Tel Aviv, Berlin, Shanghai and Beijing, and Yarkoni tells me that it may move its existing Reactors to larger spaces as their leases come up.  Microsoft Ventures, the company\u2019s vehicle for investing in startups at the Series A to D stage, won\u2019t see any major changes. \u201cVentures continues to expand and is run by a team that is very focused on our near-, mid- and long-term horizon needs,\u201d Yarkoni said. \u201cThat program continues on as it is.\u201d  The largest change will come to the Microsoft Accelerators program. This program is now called Microsoft ScaleUp, and for those startups that qualify for it, this program will now include the option of co-marketing and co-selling through Microsoft\u2019s sales force.  \u201cWe tried to build a way to plug our startups into our sales engine,\u201d Yarkoni said. Startups will get all the usual accelerator benefits, including access to Microsoft\u2019s technology and expertise, but in addition, Microsoft is training and incentivizing its own sellers to sell these startups\u2019 tools to its customers. These startups do need to be ready for this, of course, and for the most part, we are talking about B2B startups here that target the enterprise market.  One of the first companies in this program, which Microsoft has been quietly testing for a few months now, is the marketing intelligence platform Affinio. Affinio CEO Tim Burke, whose company went through the Microsoft Accelerator program in Seattle in 2016, told me that Microsoft is not just giving his company a clear playbook to follow, but also providing help with creating collateral like content, case studies and video content. He also stressed that Microsoft didn\u2019t just give him a checklist to follow but that he had plenty of check-ins and meetings with Microsoft to push this ahead. \u201cThe unique thing with this is that Microsoft has this down to a science \u2014 all the way down to the playbook,\u201d Burke said. He also stressed that he has seen a shift in how Microsoft approaches startups. \u201cYou can see and feel the shift,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how the organization as a whole has bought in. Everybody knows the goal and direction.\u201d  Affinio, which mostly targets larger enterprises, has already made a sale through this program, with 20 more in the pipeline. The plan is to push more than 100 sales opportunities into this system by the end of the quarter.  This is obviously exactly the success story that Yarkoni is talking about. It\u2019s worth mentioning that this isn\u2019t Microsoft\u2019s first foray into cross-selling third-party products. It also recently launched a somewhat similar program for ISVs, and it\u2019s taking its lessons from this to Microsoft for Startups.  Just as important as this new project, though, is the overall revamp of Microsoft\u2019s startup programs. Instead of the somewhat scattershot approach it adopted a few years ago, it looks like Yarkoni plans to make this program into a more cohesive project that gives startups more incentives to work with Microsoft (and potentially Azure, Teams, Visual Studio and its other tools) at an early stage.  For the longest time, startups have also been somewhat wary of working with Microsoft, which wasn\u2019t always known as being the easiest company to work with. At the same time, competitors like Google have been expanding their work with startups through similar accelerator programs.

As a result, Microsoft has had to seek new revenue outside of its operating system.  In 2017, as part of that effort to grow, Microsoft announced a new subscription product called Microsoft 365, bringing together Windows, the company\u2019s cloud-centered productivity suite Office 365 and enterprise tooling into a single package.  The introduction of Microsoft 365 presaged the company\u2019s re-organization which, to quote CNBC, \u201crebuilt the company around the cloud instead of Windows.\u201d This seems reasonable; if Windows isn\u2019t going to return to growth, other services have to keep adding top line revenue. Microsoft\u2019s evolution to a cloud-powered, services-focused company is therefore set to continue.  In the pursuit of new, non-Windows top line, Microsoft wagered that it could expand its \u201ccommercial cloud\u201d revenue to a $20 billion run rate by the end of its fiscal 2018. It beat the goal, reaching the $20 billion mark far ahead of the calendar-equivalent date of mid-Summer of this year.  One of those products, Teams, is a component to Office 365 and part of what Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella called a \u201cgrowth opportunity\u201d that is \u201ca lot bigger than anything [his company has] achieved.\u201d  Today we\u2019re going to explore Microsoft\u2019s current actions in one part of the cloud productivity space through the lens of Teams.  Microsoft Teams  Microsoft\u2019s Teams product is a communications tool often compared to Slack . TechCrunch, for example, recently called the software service \u201cMicrosoft\u2019s Slack competitor.\u201d ComputerWorld, in a news item earlier this year, wrote that \u201cMicrosoft turn[ed] up [the] heat on Slack\u201d when it announced new Teams features.  It goes on and on, allowing us to comfortably hold up Microsoft Teams as Redmond\u2019s answer to Slack, a company famous for its quick growth, impressive mind share and its independent status from any major tech company. That last fact remains true despite rumored acquisition interest from Microsoft itself, along with pretty much every big company in the sector you can name.  To see Microsoft invest in its own tool that competes with Slack isn\u2019t surprising. There is a large market for the product, and Redmond is loath to let any rival service cut in on its productivity revenue.  Therefore, if there is a hot productivity tool in the market and Microsoft isn\u2019t going to buy it, it might as well build one of its own. Unsurprisingly, the company has been hard at work doing just that.  Joining a big company when you are a comparatively small company can be arduous.  News that Teams could release a free version made headlines. Teams also picked up guest access in February, its introduction of Cortana integration made it into mainstream tech publications and this week Microsoft announced new \u201cretention policies\u201d for Teams.  All that and Microsoft bought Teams a friend this year in the form of Chalkup, a collaboration company focused on the education world.  In short, Teams is adding new features while building its org chart and expanding access. All good things, certainly. However, it was not too long ago Microsoft spent quite a lot of money to buy a different, distinct collaboration tool. What happened to it?  Yammer  Microsoft bought Yammer in 2012 for $1.2 billion, building out what TechCrunch called, at the time, its \u201cSocial Enterprise Strategy.\u201d And while the Yammer-Microsoft deal was \u201cgreat news\u201d for the company and its investors, it also marked the beginning of the \u201ctough part\u201d for the newly acquired startup.  Joining a big company when you are a comparatively small company can be arduous. And if you do so when the larger company is undergoing a massive change in leadership (Microsoft hired a new CEO two years after the Yammer deal) and a business model change-up (Microsoft bought Nokia in 2014, also two years after the Yammer deal, before closing that strategic idea out years later), it\u2019s probably even harder to integrate.  Externally, that difficulty showed. Following the Microsoft deal, Yammer search volume grew before stagnating and later slipping. The product was eventually switched on for free for Office 365 customers in early 2016, four years after it was purchased. Office 365 itself launched a half-decade before, making the moment a bit long in the works.  But all that is the past, and, notably, Microsoft is putting more emphasis on Yammer today than it has in recent years. That may feel odd, given what we just went over concerning Teams.  To dig into that, Crunchbase News got Microsoft\u2019s Seth Patton on the phone, who explained the company\u2019s thinking. According to the 15-year company veteran who now works on Office 365, Microsoft has two separate views for Teams and Yammer. Teams is built for what Patton calls inner-loop communication: stuff for teams, smaller companies and the like; Yammer, in contrast, is better for outer-loop communication: less tactical decisions and more company-wide communications.  The split between Slack and Teams products and the Yammers and Convos of the world isn\u2019t hokum or mere corporate-speak. I\u2019ve worked in newsrooms that used the mix of tools to allow for simple direct messaging between individuals (Slack) and team-wide threaded communications (Yammer). It takes a little getting used to, but it can flow well if you need that level of inter-party discussion.  Even more interesting than the fact that Yammer is not dead is that Microsoft is actively investing in it. According to Patton, Microsoft\u2019s chiefs \u201cdoubled down\u201d on Yammer while Teams was being brought into the market in late 2016. This gave Yammer about a year of redoubled investment and attention.  Taking all that together, Microsoft is investing in two communications products at the same time, both of which are baked into its productivity suite. So why the huge push now?  Slack: Software\u2019s favorite rocket ship  You are no doubt familiar with Slack\u2019s growth arc. It\u2019s been a nearly chronic narrative in tech for the past few years. And I don\u2019t mean that in a pejorative sense. (I\u2019m as guilty as anyone else.)  But, in case you have a life, here are some highlights: Slack reached ARR of $50 million in December of 2015. In October of 2016, Slack hit the $100 million ARR mark. Then the company bested $200 million last September. That\u2019s darn quick, and investors took notice, showering the company with cash and ever-rising valuations.  One way to get acquired, after all, is to stick out by worrying the biggest companies in the market through growth.  Fueling Slack\u2019s continued growth is a push into the realm of bigger companies. The firm launched Slack Enterprise Grid last January, bringing enterprise-grade management tools to Slack\u2019s product. With Enterprise Grid, Slack can keep going after bigger accounts. (To that point, IBM has more than 200,000 active users on Slack that use Enterprise Grid.)  That quick growth has made Slack an acquisition target. One way to get acquired, after all, is to stick out by worrying the biggest companies in the market through growth. It\u2019s just hard as heck to do, as incumbent revenue numbers are so large that, well, you have to grow fast to become interesting.  An even bigger scrap  As we know, Slack has rebuffed acquisition offers. As a result, we\u2019re seeing Microsoft, the dominant player in the world of productivity, attempt to slow down Slack in an effort to not lose future users and future dollars. Hell, even Google is in on the race. Its Slack competitor launched for early users in February. Facebook is also tinkering around the edges. It\u2019s fun to watch.  But productivity is Microsoft\u2019s cash cow. For Google, it\u2019s a big side project, but nothing compared to its advertising revenue. That puts Microsoft and Slack more up against one another in the enterprise chat fight.  (In mid-March, Microsoft announced that 200,000 organizations now use Teams, up from 125,000 in September of 2017. That\u2019s 60 percent growth in a half-year or so \u2014 a quick growth pace, too.)  What we\u2019ll learn over the next few years is if Microsoft\u2019s enormous enterprise channel can be leveraged enough to slow Slack\u2019s growth, or if Slack\u2019s momentum can actually capture a piece of the productivity market and hold onto it.  It\u2019s a startup against a platform company, a classic enough battle. But with big tech bigger, richer and more powerful than ever, it\u2019s a more relevant business case than we might think at first blush.

The company says it\u2019s tested the system repeatedly on a sample of around 2,000 sentences from various online newspapers, comparing the result to a person\u2019s translation in the process \u2013 and even hiring outside bilingual language consultants to further verify the machine\u2019s accuracy.  The sample set, called newstest2017, was released just last fall at the research conference WMT17.  It\u2019s surprising, then, how quickly the researchers were able to achieve this milestone \u2013 especially given that machine translation is a problem people have been trying to solve for decades.  Many have even believed that the goal of human parity would never be realized, Microsoft notes.  \u201cHitting human parity in a machine translation task is a dream that all of us have had,\u201d said Xuedong Huang, a technical fellow in charge of Microsoft\u2019s speech, natural language and machine translation efforts, in Microsoft\u2019s blog post. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t realize we\u2019d be able to hit it so soon.\u201d  Getting a machine to understand language at this scale is far more complicated than speech recognition \u2013 something that\u2019s seen a number of advances in recent years. Advances in A.I. and speech recognition have allowed voice assistants to find their way onto our smartphones and in our homes where help consumers with everyday computing tasks, controlling smart home devices, and for news and entertainment purposes.  But asking for a machine translation of a web page or news article still often renders the same hard-to-understand mess of words that, at best, gives you a general idea about what\u2019s being said, but is nearly impossible to grasp with any deep comprehension.  To really understand what\u2019s being said in longer articles, you\u2019d need a person\u2019s help.  But even different human translators may translate a sentence in a slightly different way, with neither being wrong.  \u201cMachine translation is much more complex than a pure pattern recognition task,\u201d said Ming Zhou, assistant managing director of Microsoft Research Asia and head of a natural language processing group that worked on the project. \u201cPeople can use different words to express the exact same thing, but you cannot necessarily say which one is better.\u201d  Recent breakthroughs in A.I. contributed to researchers achieving this milestone, Microsoft also notes.  Deep neural networks, a method of training A.I. systems, allowed the researchers to create more fluent and natural-sounding translations that take into account broader context that the prior approaches, called statistical machine translation.  Microsoft\u2019s researchers also added their own training methods to the system to improve its accuracy \u2013 things they equate to how people go over their own work time and again to make sure it\u2019s right.  The researchers said they used methods including dual learning for fact-checking translations; deliberation networks, to repeat translations and refine them; and new techniques like joint training, to iteratively boost English-to-Chinese and Chinese-to-English translation systems; and agreement regularization, which can generate translations by reading sentences both left-to-right and right-to-left.  Zhou said the techniques used to achieve the milestone won\u2019t be limited to machine translations.  \u201cThis is an area where machine translation research can apply to the whole field of AI research,\u201d Zhou said.  In addition, it could enable more accurate and natural translations across other languages in the future.  The researchers caution the system has not yet been tested on real-time news stories, and there are other challenges that still lie ahead before the technology could be commercialized into Microsoft\u2019s products.  But you can play around with the new translation system here on Microsoft\u2019s website: https://translator.microsoft.com/neural. (This is not the production system, and may run slower at times, the site warns.)  The system will show a sentence in Chinese (simplified), which is then translated two ways, with the more perfected translation on the right to demonstrate the improvements.  Machine translation is something researchers at Google have been working on as well, including with its own machine learning technique for Chinese-English queries that also uses neural nets. These advances has already been put to work to improve Google\u2019s consumer-facing products, like Google Translate\u2019s app, and its integrations in Google search.

Microsoft, No. 17-2, has been closely watched by the technology industry, which sometimes has a testy relationship with the Justice Department.

A three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in Manhattan, ruled that the warrant in the case could not be used to obtain evidence beyond the nation\u2019s borders because the 1986 law did not apply extraterritorially.

She was racist, xenophobic and downright filthy. At one point, she said the Holocaust did not happen. But she was old technology.  Let loose on the internet nearly two years ago, Tay was an experimental system built by Microsoft. She was designed to chat with digital hipsters in breezy, sometimes irreverent lingo, and American netizens quickly realized they could coax her into spewing vile and offensive language. This was largely the result of a simple design flaw \u2014 Tay was programmed to repeat what was said to her \u2014 but the damage was done. Within hours, Microsoft shut her down for good.  Since then, a new breed of conversational technology has emerged inside Microsoft and other internet giants that is far more nimble and effective than the techniques that underpinned Tay. And researchers believe these new systems will improve at an even faster rate when they are let loose on the internet. But sometimes, like Tay, these conversational systems reflect the worst of human nature. And given the history here, companies like Microsoft are reluctant to set them free \u2014 at least for now.  These systems do not simply repeat what is said to them or respond with canned answers. They teach themselves to carry on a conversation by carefully analyzing reams of real human dialogue. At Microsoft, for instance, a new system learns to chat by analyzing thousands of online discussions pulled from services like Twitter and Reddit. When you send this bot a message, it chooses a response after generating dozens of possibilities and ranking each according to how well it mirrors those human conversations.  If you complain about breaking your ankle during a football game, it is nimble enough to give you some sympathy. \u201cOuch, that\u2019s not good,\u201d it might say. \u201cHope your ankle feels better soon.\u201d If you mention house guests or dinner plans, it responds in remarkably precise and familiar ways.  marcy79  conversational_bot  Closest match to human speech Closest match to human speech Lower-ranking potential responses Lower-ranking potential responses  Despite its sophistication, this conversational system can also be nonsensical, impolite and even offensive at times. If you mention your company\u2019s C.E.O., it may assume you are talking about a man \u2014 unaware that women are chief executives, too. If you ask a simple question, you may get a cheeky reply.  marcy79  conversational_bot    Microsoft\u2019s researchers believe they can significantly improve this technology by having it chat with large numbers of people. This would help identify its flaws and generate much sharper conversational data for the system to learn from. \u201cIt is a problem if we can\u2019t get this in front of real users \u2014 and have them tell us what is right and what isn\u2019t,\u201d said a longtime Microsoft researcher, Bill Dolan.  But there lies the conundrum. Because its flaws could spark public complaints \u2014 and bad press \u2014 Microsoft is wary of pushing this technology onto the internet.  The project represents a much wider effort to build a new breed of computing system that is truly conversational. At companies like Facebook, Amazon and Salesforce as well as Microsoft, the hope is that this technology will provide smoother and easier ways of interacting with machines \u2014 easier than a keyboard and mouse, easier than a touch-screen, easier than Siri and other digital assistants now on the market, which are still a long way from fluid conversation.  For years, Silicon Valley companies trumpeted \u201cchatbots\u201d that could help you, say, book your next plane flight or solve a problem with your new computer tablet. But these have never lived up to the billing, providing little more than canned responses to common queries.  Now, thanks to the rise of algorithms that can quickly learn tasks on their own, research in conversational computing is advancing. But the industry as a whole faces the same problem as Microsoft: The new breed of chatbot talks more like a human, but that is not always a good thing.  \u201cIt is more powerful,\u201d said Alex Lebrun, who works on similar conversational systems at Facebook\u2019s artificial intelligence lab in Paris. \u201cBut it is more dangerous.\u201d  The new breed relies on \u201cneural networks,\u201d complex algorithms that can learn tasks by identifying patterns in large pools of data. Over the last five years, these algorithms have accelerated the evolution of systems that can automatically recognize faces and objects, identify commands spoken into smartphones, and translate from one language to another. They are also speeding the development of conversational systems \u2014 though this research is significantly more complex and will take longer to mature.  It may seem surprising that Microsoft researchers are training their conversational system on dialogue from Twitter and Reddit, two social networking services known for vitriolic content. But even on Twitter and Reddit, people are generally civil when they really fall into conversation, and these services are brimming with this kind of dialogue.  Microsoft researchers massage the conversational data they load into the system in small ways, but for the most part, they simply feed the raw dialogues into their neural networks, and these algorithms therefore learn from interactions that are very human. According to Mr. Dolan, in analyzing this data, the system learns to perform well even in the face of poor spelling and grammar. If you type \u201cwinne tonight drink resttaurant,\u201d it might respond with: \u201ci\u2019m not a fan of wine.\u201d It can engage in a real back-and-forth dialogue, asking for everything it needs to, say, connect with you on Linkedin. And for the most part, it behaves with civility.

Though these conversational systems are generally civil, they are sometimes rude \u2014 or worse. It is not just that the technology is new and flawed. Because they learn from vast amounts of human conversation, they learn from the mistakes we humans make, and the prejudice we exhibit.  Mr. Lebrun estimated that once in every thousand responses, this new breed of chatbot will say something racist or aggressive or otherwise unwanted. Researchers can fix these problems, but that involves gathering more and better data, or tweaking the algorithms through a process of extreme trial and error.  This is a problem for A.I. services in general. More than two years ago, a software developer noticed that the new Google Photos service was identifying black people as gorillas. Google promptly barred the service from identifying gorillas and similar animals, and it has yet to provide a fix.  But identifying and solving problems with conversational systems is harder, just because the scope of these systems \u2014 general dialogue \u2014 is so large. Image recognition is a single task. Conversation is many tasks, because it bounces back and forth, and each response can affect all the responses to come.  For this reason, Adam Coates, a partner at the venture capital firm Khosla Ventures who previously oversaw the Silicon Valley A.I. lab attached to the Chinese internet giant Baidu, warns that building a truly conversational system is far more difficult than building services that can recognize giraffes, say, or translate between German and French. \u201cThere is a huge technical barrier here. We really don\u2019t know how to build a personal assistant,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may not be simply a matter of more data. We may be missing a big idea.\u201d  In the short term, many believe, conversational systems will be most effective if they are limited to particular tasks, like asking for IT help or getting medical advice. That is still a long way from a bot that will respond well to anything you say. But Mr. Dolan believes these systems will continue to evolve over the next few years, provided companies like Microsoft can get them in front of the public.", "stock": "MSFT", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-21", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/02/21/technology/conversational-bots.html"}, {"article": "Q.

There is little doubt that the efforts put by Microsoft in hardware design has resulted in the entire PC industry producing better computers. Looking at the Surface Laptop, one could argue that Microsoft has now matched Apple, or even surpassed it in terms of design.  While Microsoft's first attempt at a non-covertable clamshell notebook was released in the US and other parts of the world last year, it has now officially landed in the Middle East. Its appeal lies to fans of the Surface Pro who wanted a larger screen and included keyboard without alienating those who can\u2019t afford the Surface Book.  Without the hybrid form factor, Microsoft has been able to remain focused on creating a laptop above all else, ditching all the frills it\u2019s hardware has been known for since the original Surface Pro. It isn\u2019t too expensive either, but it comes with the catch of leveraging a new operating system you may or may not be familiar with \u2013 Windows 10 S.  For home users buying the Surface Laptop from retail outlets, out of the box, you\u2019ll only get access to Windows Store applications. Business users on the other hand, get the Surface Laptop with Windows 10 Pro, which, an end-user can also upgrade to for free right now. Microsoft has claimed in the past that this offer is set to expire in March 2018, though the exact time and date isn\u2019t quite clear.  That, and all else considered, let\u2019s take a look at how the Surface Laptop stacks up to its main competitors. Could the Surface Laptop finally be the one to give Apple's MacBooks a run for their money?  Price, availability and value  A premium device commands a premium price tag, and the Surface Laptop starts at AED 4,199 and comes with an 2.5GHz Intel Core i5-7200U processor, 4GB of RAM and 128GB of SSD storage. Add AED 1,200 to that if you prefer 8GB RAM and 256GB storage, which is the model we received for review.  The next configuration up includes the more powerful Intel Core i7 processor, 8GB of RAM and 256GB SSD for AED 6,499. You can also pick up a Core i7 model with 16GB of RAM and 512GB storage for AED 8,600, or go all out with 1TB storage for AED 10,599.  Surely, 16GB of RAM will be tempting to some people who want to use the Surface Laptop for running demanding software or multitasking numerous applications at once. Those users will likely want to upgrade from Windows 10 S \u2013 which only allows apps to run if they've been downloaded from the Windows Store \u2013 to Windows 10 Pro.  The price of the Surface Laptop puts it in the same bracket as last year\u2019s MacBook, as well as the HP Spectre x360 and Dell XPS 13, while offering slightly better specs and power for the base model than the MacBook, but less than the HP and Dell machines.  All three of these competitors are worthy adversaries, appearing high up in our list of the best laptops in 2017 \u2013 so the Surface Laptop definitely has its work cut out for it.  The Surface Laptop in traditional 'Platinum'  Design  The Surface Laptop is quite possibly the most attractive computing product Microsoft has ever created and shows that Windows laptops can be just as gorgeously designed as Apple products.  It features a full aluminum lid and body reminiscent of the Surface Book's, which give it a sturdy yet premium feel. While these keep the Surface Laptop feeling light, they also give you confidence that this expensive bit of kit isn\u2019t going to break or dent easily at the merest of knocks.  A cool design feature places the Surface Laptop\u2019s speakers behind the keyboard, using the gaps between the keys as a sort of grille.  It means the body can remain slim, with no speakers to add to the overall size, and this compromise works very well, with sound from the Surface Laptop coming through loud and clear \u2013 though we noticed a bit of muffling when typing at the same time. This may be an issue if you enjoy listening to Spotify while working, but at least the included audio jack allows you to hook up the Surface Laptop to an external speaker.  Those strange strips of plastic on the base? They're Wi-Fi antennae  Speaking of ports, the Surface Laptop comes with a USB 3.0 port, Mini DisplayPort and Microsoft's proprietary Surface Connect power and docking port, as found on other Surface devices.  It\u2019s a shame to not find a USB-C port, as an increasing number of peripherals are coming out with this connection, and many of the Surface Laptop\u2019s competitors include it.  On the other hand, though, we\u2019re also relieved that Microsoft hasn\u2019t followed Apple\u2019s USB-C or nothing approach.  The limited number of ports mean the Surface Laptop can maintain a thin profile \u2013 in fact it measures just 14.48mm thick, making it thinner than the Dell XPS 13\u2019s 15mm, though slightly thicker than the MacBook at 13.1mm and the HP Spectre at 13.7mm.  So, while it\u2019s not the thinnest laptop around the Surface Laptop is still pretty darn slim, and it weighs just 1.25kg, which is lighter than the Dell\u2019s 1.29kg, though again it\u2019s more weighty than the MacBook, which tips the scales at 1.08kg.  Still, it\u2019s impressively light, and easy to hold in one hand. For carrying around, this is one of the most comfortable laptops you can buy.  A comparison with the Surface Book  Keyboard and Trackpad  Unlike the Surface Book, the Surface Laptop doesn\u2019t feature an aluminum keyboard \u2013 instead Microsoft has opted for plastic keys. Before you start to worry that this could lead to the Surface Laptop feeling a bit cheap, it also features Alcantara fabric material, which is imported from Italy and laser-cut to fit the keyboard and which gives the Surface Laptop a very pleasant and premium feel.  The key travel on the Surface Laptop is satisfying, with 1.5mm of travel giving you a decent physical response when typing.  The trackpad also felt good, and the longer vertical size of the body (due to the 3:2 aspect ratio of the screen) gives you a comfortable place to rest your palms as you type on the keyboard.  Display  The screen is a bright and vibrant 13.5-inch PixelSense touchscreen display, which is reinforced with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 for protection against scratches. The resolution is 2256 x 1504, which gives it a pixel density of 201ppi (pixels per inch).  Resolution fans out there (come on, there must be some) will notice the slightly unusual resolution here, which is due to the Surface Pro\u2019s screen having a 3:2 aspect ratio \u2013 most laptop (and monitor) aspect ratios are 16:9 (with MacBooks being 16:10).  What this means in practice is that the Surface Laptop\u2019s screen is taller, which gives you a bit more screen room when working \u2013 though it does mean that if you\u2019re watching widescreen videos you\u2019re going to get larger black bars running along the top and bottom of the screen.  The Surface Laptop's keyboard deck is awfully comfortable  The aspect ratio of the screen has implications for the size of the Surface Laptop as well, with the device having a wider body due to it.  Overall, though, the Surface Laptop is a fantastic-looking device that will certainly turn heads when you take it out to use it, while still feeling comfortable to work on and carry around.", "stock": "MSFT", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-20", "source": "techradar", "url": "https://www.techradar.com/reviews/microsoft-surface-laptop-uae"}, {"article": "Microsoft has started offering a version of its Surface Laptop with Windows 10 Pro pre-installed as a configuration option dubbed the \u2018Commercial Microsoft Surface Laptop.\u2019  Currently available only in the US, the options start at $1,199 costs, another $200 more to than the entry-level version of the Microsoft Surface Laptop with Windows 10 S installed.  Windows 10 S is Microsoft\u2019s streamlined version of the operating system (OS) that only allows apps to be installed from its Microsoft Store, whereas Windows 10 (Pro) regularly allows you to install programs you want from any source.  The commercial version of the Surface Laptop also starts with a $200 price hike on account of the laptop starting with 8GB of memory versus the consumer-grade model\u2019s 4GB to start. Then there's the embedded cost of the Windows 10 Pro OS, which is normally $200 on its own.  (If you want 8GB of memory on a normal Surface Laptop with Windows 10 S, you are forced to cough up $1,299 for that and 256GB of storage as well.)  With that, you\u2019re saving 100 bucks on the pre-installation of Windows 10 Pro if you were to install the OS on a Surface Laptop after, say, Microsoft\u2019s newly-extended March 31, 2018 deadline for free upgrades from Windows 10 S to Pro.  Of course, this move seems to be Microsoft getting ahead of that deadline for Windows 10 S users to make the switch \u2013 or, rather, upgrade.  What does this mean for Windows 10 S?  Microsoft hasn\u2019t added any new SKUs or plans to offer Windows 10 Pro on the original Surface Laptop, but users can still get free upgrades to Windows 10 Pro until March 31. Whether Microsoft will offer a similar option to general consumers after the fact, or just point them to this new model, is unclear.  Beyond this option in pre-installed OS, there doesn\u2019t seem to be any difference between the two versions of the Surface Laptop. So, it appears that Microsoft is appealing to business customers that need the freedom and versatility of full-fat Windows 10.  What does that say for Windows 10 S? Not much more than reiterating the fact that the OS is ideal for users in education and those that don\u2019t want to worry about all the security of their device \u2013 and that\u2019s about it.  This move doesn\u2019t imply anything about the fate of Windows 10 S, but rather refines the definition of its purpose in the scheme of Windows 10 offerings.  But, if you want the incredible look and feel of the Surface Laptop with the full Windows 10 experience, you better grab one before March 31 and upgrade for free.

As the blog explains: \u201cProject Zanzibar invites children to bring their toys into an interactive experience and watch them come alive through sound, visuals and special effects. The team had observed kids spending hours making stop-action movies to share online.\u201d  The mat can also detect the location of toys on the mat, and by sensing where certain toys are, and if they are near other toys, can broadcast lines of dialog, telling a story as the children play.  While some people may be concerned that Project Zanzibar is aiming to stop kids using their imaginations when playing, and instead use a computer to create sounds and special effects, the researchers claim to be taking a different angle by changing how children interact with PCs.  Many kids spend more time interacting with a 2D screen than playing with physical toys, and the Project Zanzibar team want to change this.  As Haiyan Zhang, a Project Zanzibar researcher, says: \u201cThe physical world is such a rich place, abundant with dimensionality and materiality. Our vision is to tap into that richness and imbue it with that digital magic and our hope is that Project Zanzibar is a step in that direction.\u201d  Image credit: Microsoft  Help with learning  The team is also keen to stress the teaching possibilities of Project Zanzibar, inspired by the Montessori Method, a theory developed in the early 20th century by Maria Montessori, which looked at how important physical activity is for helping children to learn. \u201cWe took traditional Montessori exercises for young children and extended them with digital content and feedback using Project Zanzibar,\u201d the blog explains.  The team is also looking at creating a range of educational apps, which include spelling and coding lessons, that use physical cards and allow the children to use natural, tactile, actions to interact with the apps.  How does it work?  The blog also delves into how the Project Zanzibar prototype works, including how the NFC technology can detect the position of objects, and how the mat can be rolled up to be easily portable. It can also detect when objects are stacked on each other and in which order, which is all pretty clever.  Items don\u2019t need to be placed directly on the mat, which can detect NFC objects from 30mm above. It can also recognize gestures made above the mat, such as drawing shapes in the air. The mat connects to a computer via USB or Bluetooth.  The team has released a technical paper providing even more information about the project.  It\u2019s all pretty exciting stuff, and we\u2019re looking forward to seeing the fruits of Project Zanzibar\u2019s labors. If it lives up to its potential, it really could change the way we \u2013 and our children \u2013 interact with computers.", "stock": "MSFT", "label": 1, "date": "2018-04-10", "source": "techradar", "url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/microsofts-project-zanzibar-blends-the-digital-and-physical-worlds-to-create-something-truly-special"}, {"article": "When it comes to big-name exclusive games, Microsoft is lagging somewhat.

On Tuesday the Supreme Court will consider if U.S. internet providers can subvert federal law and public safety.  At issue in Microsoft v. U.S. is whether warrants issued under the 1986 Stored Communications Act apply to records stored on the cloud. The law allows the government to obtain records from a U.S. internet provider if there is probable cause of a crime. A special Section 2703 warrant functions like a subpoena since law enforcement doesn\u2019t directly seize records from servers.  In 2013 the U.S. government sought such a warrant for contents associated with an MSN.com email account believed to include evidence of narcotics trafficking. A federal magistrate issued a warrant covering \u201cinformation associated with\u201d the account \u201cstored at premises owned, maintained, controlled, or operated by Microsoft Corporation.\u201d  While Microsoft agreed to disclose records stored on its U.S. servers, it refused to turn over content on its \u201ccloud\u201d servers in Dublin, Ireland. The Redmond, Wash.-based company, which was held in civil contempt, says the law doesn\u2019t authorize extraterritorial warrants. It\u2019s right on this point, but wrong on everything else.  In Morrison (2010) and RJR Nabisco, Inc. (2016), the Supreme Court developed a two-step analysis to determine if a law applies overseas. First, courts must ask whether a law includes a \u201cclear, affirmative indication that [the statutory provision] applies extraterritorially.\u201d If not, the statute is presumed not to be extraterritorial.  But then courts must assess whether a case primarily \u201cinvolves a domestic application of the statute\u201d by looking at its \u201cfocus.\u201d As the Court held in Nabisco, \u201cIf the conduct relevant to the statute\u2019s focus occurred in the United States, then the case involves a permissible domestic application even if other conduct occurred abroad.\u201d  This second part is key in the Microsoft case. There\u2019s no disputing that the Stored Communications Act doesn\u2019t expressly apply to foreign parties. The government could not compel an internet provider based in France to hand over a French citizen\u2019s emails. But as the judge who issued the warrant observed, the government\u2019s application of the law \u201cdoes not criminalize conduct taking place in a foreign country\u201d and doesn\u2019t deploy U.S. cops overseas.  Employees at Microsoft headquarters could obtain records stored on foreign servers with a few keystrokes. Internet providers typically decide where to store data to maximize efficiency. Google cuts up emails into \u201cshards,\u201d which can move between countries within seconds without human intervention. U.S. internet users aren\u2019t entitled to know where in the cloud their records are stored, let alone to recourse under U.S. law if a company moves them.  A federal district judge held that the Microsoft warrant wasn\u2019t extraterritorial since the disclosure of records to the government occurs in the U.S. But a Second Circuit Court of Appeals panel disagreed in 2016, and tech companies have since resisted warrants for data stored overseas. While the circuit refused to hear the case en banc, Judges Jos\u00e9 Cabranes, Dennis Jacobs, Reena Raggi and Christopher Droney wrote an incisive dissent on the far-reaching implications of the panel\u2019s rogue ruling, which conflicts with every other district and magistrate decision.  The panel \u201chas substantially burdened the government\u2019s legitimate law enforcement efforts; created a roadmap for the facilitation of criminal activity; and impeded programs to protect the national security of the United States and its allies,\u201d the judges explained.  Tech firms argue that a Court decision upholding the government\u2019s authority to compel disclosure of data overseas would cause international friction due to conflicting legal regimes on data privacy. But more than a dozen countries including Australia, France, Ireland, Canada and the U.K. assert this authority. The U.S. would be an outlier.  They also argue that Congress is better situated to resolve the complicated issues of cloud computing that were never envisioned three decades ago. Senators Orrin Hatch and Chris Coons have introduced legislation to modernize the Stored Communications Act and clarify legal obligations for internet providers.  But pending legislation shouldn\u2019t obviate a judicial decision on a black-and-white legal question critical to public safety. Letting a flawed ruling stand would lead to more needless failures in law enforcement.", "stock": "MSFT", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-27", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsofts-legal-cloud-cover-1519689734"}, {"article": "Microsoft Corp. MSFT -0.53% is scheduled to report fiscal second-quarter earnings after the market closes Wednesday. Here\u2019s what to expect.  EARNINGS FORECAST: Analysts surveyed by S&P Global Market Intelligence expect Microsoft to report per-share earnings of 86 cents under generally accepted accounting principles, up from 80 cents a year earlier. Microsoft no longer reports adjusted figures, reflecting accounting changes it adopted at the start of the fiscal year. The year ago figure reflects that change.  REVENUE FORECAST: Analysts expect Microsoft to post revenue of $28.41 billion, up from $25.83 billion a year earlier. The year-ago figure, too, reflects the new accounting standard.  WHAT TO WATCH:  CLOUDY CONDITIONS: In the last year, Microsoft has emerged as the primary competitor to Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s market-leading cloud-infrastructure business. Three months ago, Microsoft said its commercial-cloud run rate\u2014the last month of sales of its Azure infrastructure services and Office 365 products, multiplied by 12\u2014topped $20 billion, nine months ahead of the company\u2019s target. RBC Capital Markets analyst Ross MacMillan, in a recent research report, said he expects 85% growth in Azure revenue and 42% growth in the commercial version of Office 365. Mr. MacMillan estimates Microsoft\u2019s Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes Azure, will climb 10% to $7.4 billion in the quarter, and that its Productivity and Business Processes segment, which includes Office, will grow 24% to $8.9 billion.  PLAYING GAMES: Microsoft\u2019s Xbox videogame console generally does its best business during the holiday quarter, and was primed to do particularly well with the debut of its Xbox One X console in November. Stifel Nicolaus & Co. analyst Brad Reback wrote in a research note that Xbox outsold Sony Corp.\u2019s PlayStation 4 in December, but both were outsold by Nintendo Co.\u2019s Switch. Xbox is part of Microsoft\u2019s More Personal Computing segment, and the console\u2019s gains likely will be offset by continued sluggish PC sales, which track closely to the company\u2019s Windows operating system business. World-wide PC shipments grew 0.7% in the last quarter, according to International Data Corp. Mr. Reback estimates the segment, which is Microsoft\u2019s largest, will grow 0.6% to $11.96 billion.  TAXING TIMES: \u201cTax rate and repatriation commentary from a historically conservative management team represent the key wild card for the quarter,\u201d Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss wrote in a research report. Mr. Weiss estimates Microsoft\u2019s tax rate will decline to 16% as a result of the tax-code overhaul President Donald Trump signed into law in December. A year ago, Microsoft\u2019s effective tax rate was 18%.  CASH CONSIDERATIONS: Mr. Weiss expects Microsoft to eventually repatriate cash held abroad, which totaled $132.1 billion at the end of the fiscal first quarter, behind only Apple Inc.\u2019s $252.3 billion. He didn\u2019t speculate when Microsoft will bring the money to the U.S., but estimates the company will pay about $21 billion in taxes as a result of the tax law, which hits companies with a one-time tax of 15.5% on overseas profits held in cash and other liquid assets. RBC\u2019s Mr. MacMillan wrote about the potential for domestic acquisitions and shareholder returns through dividends or buybacks. Earlier this month, Apple said it would pay $38 billion in taxes as it brings home the vast majority of its overseas cash.

MSFT -0.53% took a $13.8 billion charge related to the new U.S. tax law but reported significant growth in its cloud operations, the business fueling the company\u2019s resurgence.  Microsoft keeps overseas the vast majority of its cash, which rose to $142.8 billion in the quarter. In an interview, Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood declined to say when the company might bring home some of that money.  Ms. Hood said Microsoft has been \u201cone of the leading returners of capital to shareholders\u201d in recent years, using debt to finance much of that. She said the cash would mitigate the need to turn to debt markets to pay for stock repurchases.  Microsoft already has carved a spot for itself as the No. 2 company behind Amazon.com Inc. in renting computing power and storage over the web. For its fiscal second quarter, the company reported strong gains in the two biggest pieces of its cloud-computing business: its Azure infrastructure services and Office 365 online-productivity business.  Though Microsoft doesn\u2019t disclose revenue for those businesses, it said Azure jumped 98% and Office 365 grew 41%. In the previous quarter, Azure gained 90% and Office 365 grew 42%.  Its Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes Azure, climbed 15% to $7.8 billion. Its Productivity and Business Processes segment, which includes Office, gained 25% to $8.95 billion.  Overall, Microsoft posted a loss of $6.3 billion, or 82 cents a share, compared with a profit of $6.27 billion, or 80 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue grew 12% to $28.92 billion.  Excluding the impact of the tax law, Microsoft reported a profit of $7.5 billion, or 96 cents a share.  Analysts surveyed by S&P Global Market Intelligence expected Microsoft to report per-share earnings of 86 cents on revenue of $28.41 billion.  Shares, which have climbed nearly 50% in the past year to set records, fell a penny to $95 in after-hours trading.  The company\u2019s adjusted tax rate, which doesn\u2019t count the big charge, was 18%, up slightly from a year ago. Looking ahead, Ms. Hood said it expects a 16% tax rate for the second half of the fiscal year, plus or minus 2 percentage points. For fiscal 2019, the company expects the tax rate to be slightly below the new U.S. corporate rate of 21%.  Microsoft rose to its former tech dominance on the strength of Windows, its PC operating system. And while the More Personal Computing segment that includes Windows is Microsoft\u2019s largest, it is also the company\u2019s slowest growing.  That is in part because growth in world-wide PC sales remains sluggish, inching up only 0.7% in the last quarter, according to International Data Corp. More Personal Computing, though, gained 2% to $12.17 billion in the latest period.  In a conference call with Wall Street analysts, Chief Executive Satya Nadella said investments in security technology helped Microsoft quickly address the recent threats from the Spectre and Meltdown processor vulnerabilities.  \u201cOur investments to make Windows 10 the most secure, always up-to-date operating system enabled us to move quickly to protect customers in the face of these threats,\u201d Mr. Nadella said.  The More Personal Computing segment also includes Microsoft\u2019s Xbox videogame business. The holiday quarter is particularly important for gaming at Microsoft, even more so after the company released its new Xbox One X console in November. In the period, gaming revenue\u2014which includes sales of the Xbox console, Xbox Live subscriptions and transactions, and game and accessory sales\u2014rose 8%.  It has been a year since Microsoft purchased LinkedIn Corp., the professional social network, for $27 billion. In the quarter, LinkedIn added $1.31 billion in revenue.

The company says it shouldn\u2019t have to hand over emails stored on a server in Ireland. Photo: NIALL CARSON/PRESS ASSOCIATION/GETTY IMAGES  WASHINGTON\u2014Technology companies will square off with law enforcement on Tuesday as the Supreme Court hears arguments on whether emails and other customer data stored overseas are subject to U.S. search warrants.  The case is one of several legal battles on law-enforcement access to private online data, and it requires the justices to interpret a law that Congress wrote before email and cloud computing were part of everyday life.  A federal appeals court, in a 2016 case involving Microsoft Corp. , handed a blow to prosecutors by ruling that such warrants can\u2019t be enforced on U.S. providers if the data is stored exclusively on foreign servers. That is the decision the Supreme Court is reviewing.  The case highlights broader tensions between tech titans, which view protecting user privacy as a priority, and authorities who believe privacy concerns should take a back seat to public safety in certain circumstances.  Battle lines have been firmly drawn, with opposing camps warning of serious harm if the court rules against their position.  The Justice Department and state attorneys general say the lower court ruling has hampered investigations into an array of crimes, from narcotics trafficking to arson to child pornography. Emails and electronic evidence are now critical to virtually every criminal investigation, they say.  Microsoft, Google and other technology companies say the Justice Department\u2019s position would leave them stuck between U.S. law enforcement and their obligation to abide by privacy laws in foreign jurisdictions. The companies also say the case could threaten American dominance in the $250 billion cloud-computing industry, because foreign clients won\u2019t use U.S. firms if their data isn\u2019t protected.  Foreign governments also have weighed in, urging the Supreme Court not to interpret U.S. law in a way that intrudes on their sovereignty.  \u201cThis may be a case in which the Supreme Court has no truly satisfying outcome available to it, in part because it is being asked to interpret a 1986 law that is not a good fit for the kind of large-scale, cross-border data-storage practices of today,\u201d said David Newman, a lawyer with Morrison & Foerster LLP who closely follows privacy and data-security issues.  The law at issue is the Stored Communications Act, passed by Congress more than 30 years ago to provide privacy protections for electronic records.  The Justice Department applied for a warrant requiring Microsoft to turn over email information from an account allegedly tied to illegal drug activity in the U.S. A magistrate judge issued the warrant after finding the government had established probable cause that the account was connected to narcotics trafficking.  Newsletter Sign-up  Microsoft handed over some account data that was stored in the U.S. but said it shouldn\u2019t have to hand over the emails, which were stored on a server in Ireland. The company said the government has never suggested that the account holder is a citizen or resident of the U.S.  The Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with Microsoft, ruling the 1986 law didn\u2019t apply beyond U.S. territory.  Microsoft said in its Supreme Court brief that the materials targeted for government seizure are covered by Irish and European Union law. That means the U.S. is seeking to assert the 1986 law beyond domestic borders, which isn\u2019t allowed, the company argued.  Microsoft conceded that U.S. law is outdated but said that was an issue for lawmakers, not judges, to address.  \u201cOnly Congress has the authority and tools to rewrite the statute to strike a new, 21st-Century balance between law-enforcement interests, our relations with foreign nations, the privacy of our citizens, and the competitiveness of our technology industry,\u201d the company said in its brief.  A bipartisan group of lawmakers has introduced legislation to tackle cross-border data issues, but it isn\u2019t clear if the bill will advance in Congress.  The Justice Department said it isn\u2019t seeking to apply the current U.S. law extraterritorially. It noted the government sought disclosure in the U.S., where officials at Microsoft\u2019s headquarters in Redmond, Wash., have ready access to files stored abroad.  \u201cMicrosoft\u2019s employees could prepare that disclosure without leaving their desks in the United States,\u201d Solicitor General Noel Francisco wrote in a court brief.  The department argued that Microsoft\u2019s position could keep investigators from accessing emails and other files even if the subject of the investigation is based in the U.S., if a company chooses to store the consumer\u2019s files overseas.  There is a diplomatic process, governed by legal assistance treaties, that allows the U.S. to request that foreign law-enforcement counterparts share sought-after data, but it can be slow and ineffective, the department said.  WSJ's Joanna Stern \"bumps\" into Peggy Johnson in the elevator at D.Live and asks about Microsoft's next big investments, Solitaire and women in technology. Photo: Andria Chamberlin for The Wall Street Journal  While the case before the court involves Microsoft, the government also took aim at Google, whose network-management practices often involve dividing data from a single customer file into chunks that are moved within an international network of data centers.  If Microsoft\u2019s arguments prevail, then Google\u2019s practices would make its data inaccessible to law enforcement, the Justice Department said.  Google has been involved in several warrant battles with federal and state authorities, agreeing to be held in contempt in some cases for failing to turn over data. The company, like Microsoft, is pushing for a legislative solution.  Since the Second Circuit ruling, legal battles between prosecutors and tech companies have continued in other jurisdictions, and several courts have ruled in the government\u2019s favor, including in California, Florida, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.  A Supreme Court decision is expected by the end of June.

Terry Myerson, executive vice president of the Windows and Devices Group, speaking at a Microsoft developers conference in Seattle in May 2017. Photo: Elaine Thompson/Associated Press  Microsoft Corp. MSFT -0.53% is downgrading the role of Windows, the storied franchise that put the company atop the personal-computer market at a time when cloud computing didn\u2019t exist.  Now, amid the massive shift in the way computing power is harnessed, the software giant will reorganize its business around its growing Azure cloud-computing operations and its stalwart Office productivity business.  Executive Vice President Terry Myerson, who ran the Windows business, will leave the company, according to an internal email from Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella on Thursday.  The move is designed to focus Microsoft on its biggest areas of growth. In its latest quarter Azure revenue jumped 98% while Office 365 grew 41%, though the company doesn\u2019t give totals for those segments. In the same period, the More Personal Computing unit, which includes Windows, gained 2% to $12.17 billion.  \u201cHaving a deep sense of customers\u2019 unmet and unarticulated needs must drive our innovation,\u201d Mr. Nadella said in the email he sent to employees Thursday morning. \u201cWe can\u2019t let any organizational boundaries get in the way of innovation for our customers. This is why a growth-mindset culture matters.\u201d  Microsoft declined to make executives available for comment.  In a post on Microsoft\u2019s LinkedIn page, Mr. Myerson, who has run the Windows business since 2013, said the day was an \u201cemotional\u201d one for him but expressed his \u201congoing enthusiasm for Microsoft.\u201d  For most of its 43 years, Microsoft and Windows have been nearly synonymous. Under Mr. Nadella\u2019s predecessor, Steve Ballmer, products were sometimes stalled, or even killed, because they didn\u2019t help expand the market for the operating system.  That Mr. Nadella is willing to shift the company\u2019s focus away from Windows illustrates the irreversible migration from personal computing to mobile devices and the web. It also shows how Mr. Nadella is putting his own imprint on the tech giant.  \u201cHe\u2019s clearly not handcuffed by history,\u201d said Stifel Nicolaus & Co. analyst Brad Reback.  Mr. Nadella is able to break from the past because, during his four years as chief executive, Microsoft has emerged as a leader in cloud computing. Its Azure operations is No. 2 behind Amazon.com in the cloud-infrastructure market. And its Office 365 productivity apps and its Dynamics business-software services are rapidly growing, multibillion-dollar businesses.  \u201cThe Microsoft of old could never have made this move,\u201d Mr. Reback said. \u201cBut the pieces were not in place to make the move.\u201d  Mr. Myerson, a 21-year Microsoft veteran, will leave the company and help with the transition \u201cover the coming months,\u201d Mr. Nadella wrote.  \ufeff The company is breaking Windows in pieces. The platform technology, on which Microsoft\u2019s partners build their own devices, apps and services, will now fall under Scott Guthrie, who runs the Azure business. Mr. Guthrie\u2019s unit, called Cloud + AI Platform, will also include the company\u2019s mixed-reality business, including Microsoft\u2019s Hololens device, as well as its artificial-intelligence business.  Microsoft\u2019s devices business, including its Surface lineup of computers, will fall to Rajesh Jha, who has been in charge of Microsoft\u2019s Office group. The new, bigger unit, called Experiences & Devices, will also include Microsoft\u2019s efforts to develop new features in Windows.  In his note, Mr. Nadella called the future of Windows \u201cbright,\u201d as the company pushes to develop features that take advantage of new types of devices and emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence. Nearly 700 million devices run Windows 10, the software\u2019s latest version. All told, some version of Windows is on more than 1.5 billion devices world-wide. In the most recent quarter, the More Personal Computing unit accounted for 42% of Microsoft\u2019s revenue.  \u201cThis is the most sweeping reorg that I can recall,\u201d said Brad Silverberg, who ran the Windows division when Microsoft launched its seminal Windows 95 operating system.  In the 1990s, Windows was so dominant that a federal judge ruled that it was a monopoly. The U.S. Department of Justice sought to break up Microsoft, accusing the company of abusing its dominance in the PC operating system market to crush rivals. The company ultimately signed a consent decree in 2002, agreeing, in part, to make Windows interoperable with non-Microsoft software.  While Microsoft is still focused on building the platform upon which other tech companies run their technology, that focus is now on Azure, said Mr. Silverberg, a venture capitalist who co-founded Fuel Capital, a San Francisco-based firm. He praised Mr. Nadella\u2019s acknowledgment of Windows\u2019 reduced importance.  \u201cHe recognizes the world for what it is, not what it used to be,\u201d Mr. Silverberg said.

AMZN -1.22%  The search-engine operator has plans to build three new underwater fiber-optic cables lining ocean areas from the Pacific to the North Sea, extending its private data network to regions competitors haven\u2019t touched with similar projects.  The cables, expected to be finished in 2019, are designed to speed the transfer of data and reroute users to servers around the globe if a region fails or gets overloaded.  Google said the investments could cost hundreds of millions of dollars but are worth the expense to get a better shot at the multibillion-dollar cloud-computing market.  \u201cI would prefer not to have to be in the cable-building consortium business,\u201d said Ben Treynor, vice president of Google\u2019s cloud platform, but when the company looked at ways to push its cloud business past new frontiers like Australia and South America, \u201cthere weren\u2019t a lot of great options.\u201d  Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOGL -0.12% owns a massive network of fiber-optic cables and data centers built up over the past decade. Mr. Treynor said the infrastructure already adds up to the world\u2019s biggest private network, handling roughly 25% of the world\u2019s internet traffic, and helps Google control its data-intensive software without relying on telecom companies.  The projects would bring the number of subsea cables Google has helped build to 11 after a decade of nonstop construction. Its engineers rely on all those conduits to refresh search results, move video files and serve cloud-computing customers who do business in different parts of the globe.  That last business line could use a boost. Google is third in cloud-computing revenue behind Amazon and Microsoft in the race to win big customers, which run everything from shopping websites to government databases on the tech giants\u2019 computer servers. Billions of dollars of annual revenue are at stake as corporations move their information-technology operations to more flexible systems on the cloud.  Google has teamed up with other firms, including domestic telephone operators and Facebook Inc., to build its subsea cables. But it is breaking precedent with its longest, fully private long-distance cable, which will stretch 6,200 miles from Los Angeles to Chile, where the company finished a data center in 2015.  \u201cThis is, I believe, the largest single pipe into Chile,\u201d Mr. Treynor said of the Curie cable, named after the French scientist Marie Curie.  Related Video \u200bGoogle handles 90% of the world's internet searches, and it increasingly is promoting a single answer for many questions. Even subjective or unanswerable queries sometimes get seemingly definitive answers. Here's how the algorithms are -- and aren't -- working. Video/Photo Illustration: Heather Seidel/The Wall Street Journal  The company is planning to share capacity with Facebook on a planned 4,500-mile cable from the East Coast of the U.S. to Denmark, with a pit stop in Ireland. The Havfrue line, Danish for \u201cmermaid,\u201d will give the company more bandwidth across the Atlantic Ocean.  A planned 2,400-mile cable called HK-G, running from Hong Kong to Guam, will hook up with other cable systems linking Australia, East Asia and North America.  Google\u2019s new cables will help link five new regions for cloud customers in Montreal, the Netherlands, Los Angeles, Finland and Hong Kong.  The company\u2019s network-driven strategy has gained it some attention.

Mr. Shivananda said the payments processor was impressed by Google\u2019s consistently fast connections. Transactions that take too long often make users abandon a purchase entirely, he said.  Some of PayPal\u2019s acquired companies, including Braintree and Venmo, still run partly on Amazon. \u201cWe\u2019ll be a multi-cloud environment\u201d for the foreseeable future, Mr. Shivananda said.  \u2014Jack Nicas contributed to this article.", "stock": "MSFT", "label": -1, "date": "2018-01-16", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-plans-to-expand-huge-undersea-cables-to-boost-cloud-business-1516098601"}, {"article": "What\u2019s more, more than half of members, 51%, used LinkedIn every few weeks or less often, Pew found. By comparison, 76% of Facebook Inc. members used the service at least daily, Pew found.  At the time of the deal, Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella said one goal was to weave together the tools people use to get their jobs done and professional networks that connect workers.  To achieve that end, LinkedIn needs members such as Mr. Frank to engage more frequently, updating their job titles, contacts, career achievements and more\u2014data crucial to Microsoft\u2019s plans to integrate its expensive acquisition. Microsoft wants to pump that data into artificial-intelligence offerings, business-software services and even its Office productivity tools, such as its Outlook email and calendar programs.  Artificial intelligence could help Microsoft\u2019s Dynamics business play catch-up to Salesforce.com Inc. To that end, Microsoft is using LinkedIn data to help sales representatives target fertile prospects, critical in the so-called customer-relationship management market that Gartner Inc. estimates hit $39.4 billion last year.  Microsoft has started to infuse Office apps with LinkedIn data about contacts, so meeting attendees learn about one another directly from calendar invitations. The company hopes that level of integration will give its venerable franchise a leg up against Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Gmail.  Applying artificial-intelligence algorithms to LinkedIn data could create new revenue opportunities for Microsoft, said Goldman Sachs & Co. analyst Heather Bellini. \u201cThis is a company that has different ways to monetize than it used to,\u201d she said.  LinkedIn is about to roll out a passel of features aimed at drawing people regularly. For the past year, its engineers have worked on Project Agora, revamping everything from the site\u2019s news feed to the service that lets members message one another.  This spring, LinkedIn will add an \u201cinterest panel\u201d to members\u2019 home pages that will include groups they\u2019ve joined and hashtags they\u2019ve followed\u2014features intended to keep members coming back to learn the latest on topics that matter to them. By summer, LinkedIn will add content from groups into news feeds and notify members of such posts. That way, members will see posts that are related to their interests and won\u2019t be put off by posts from connections with whom they have little in common.  Still, it is a steep challenge to get members to carve out more time for the service, particularly if they turn to LinkedIn only when looking for work or seeking out sales leads, said TJ Keitt, a senior analyst at Forrester Research Inc.  \u201cThere are a ton of people that don\u2019t have an immediate need to engage with it,\u201d Mr. Keitt said.  The goal of Project Agora, named after the public meeting spaces in ancient Greece, is to convince members that LinkedIn is also a place to hone professional skills, find mentors and share knowledge to solve business problems.  \u201cWe need to make LinkedIn a place where people talk to one another,\u201d said Kiran Prasad, vice president of LinkedIn Product, who leads the project.  Mr. Prasad recognizes the challenge of changing people\u2019s perceptions of LinkedIn as just a place to look for new job opportunities. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re under an illusion that it\u2019s going to happen on day one,\u201d he said.  Recent efforts to boost engagement, such as adding videos to help professionals learn new skills and editorially curated content tailored in part to members\u2019 industries, are working, said Jeff Weiner, LinkedIn\u2019s chief executive.  LinkedIn said \u201csessions,\u201d which track each time members use the service more than 30 minutes after their prior activity, have grown more than 20% for five consecutive quarters. LinkedIn declined to give more specific data.  \u201cEngagement has started to meaningfully accelerate for the first time in a long time,\u201d Mr. Weiner said.

The case, set to be heard next month, stems from a dispute between the Justice Department and Microsoft Corp. over access to emails stored on a server in Ireland. Industry officials say it highlights the stark differences between the U.S. and Europe over views on online privacy and the extent of government access to users\u2019 data.  The U.S. government in 2013 obtained a search warrant requiring Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft to hand over email information as part of an investigation into a customer who allegedly was using the account to conduct criminal drug activity.  Microsoft complied with part of the order but rebuffed the request to turn over the email messages, which were stored abroad, arguing that U.S. search warrants don\u2019t reach data stored outside domestic borders. Microsoft argues that complying with the warrant would have meant the company could have run afoul of EU privacy rules.  At issue in the court case are broader questions about who should govern global internet companies, and how. In particular, cloud computing companies, such as Microsoft or Amazon.com Inc., can move data among different servers around the world.  Microsoft says it stores users\u2019 data in the region where a user resides and customers should be in control of their data.  The U.S. argues that its warrant required Microsoft to hand over the information because it can be accessed in the U.S. with the click of a computer mouse, and lack of access to that data could pose significant barriers to ongoing investigations.  \u201cHundreds if not thousands of investigations of crimes\u2014ranging from terrorism, to child pornography, to fraud\u2014are being or will be hampered by the government\u2019s inability to obtain electronic evidence,\u201d the Justice Department said in a court brief.  A U.S. government win in the case could hand U.S. companies operating in Europe an expensive dilemma: either comply with U.S. data requests or risk breaching EU data privacy rules. European companies with business operations in the U.S. also fear they could receive similar requests from American authorities sent to their headquarters abroad.  \u201cThis untenable position would throw a wrench into the countless routine business arrangements that comprise today\u2019s highly interdependent commercial world,\u201d the largest trade organizations from Germany, Ireland, Poland and France said in a joint filing to the court.  Foreign governments can access evidence in Europe for criminal investigations, but the preferred method under EU law is to go directly through member states, as part of what is known as a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty. That approach will be enshrined in the bloc\u2019s new data protection regulation, to enter into force in May. The new rules threaten fines as high as 4% of a firm\u2019s global revenue for failure to comply.  Washington\u2019s position seems to fly in the face of EU sovereignty, some European officials and legal experts said.  \u201cThis can clearly escalate to being a conflict of law and international relations,\u201d said Jan Philipp Albrecht, a Green Party member of the European Parliament and staunch privacy advocate. \u201cThe question [is] if the EU can expect that their own laws apply to their own territory and market or is the U.S. trying to put that into question?\u201d  Companies, governments and institutions in Europe and elsewhere have submitted third-party briefs to the court ahead of the hearing, which is set for February 27. A decision is expected by June.  The U.K., one of the U.S.\u2019s closest law-enforcement allies in Europe, has thrown its weight behind Washington\u2019s arguments in the case. Britain, which is preparing to exit the EU, is also currently negotiating a bilateral treaty with the U.S. over access for law-enforcement purposes to electronic communications held on servers in each other\u2019s jurisdictions.  The case is reminding some Europeans of leaks by one-time National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden disclosing that U.S. tech companies cooperated with the NSA, allowing authorities to access information through a so-called backdoor. Those revelations sowed deep mistrust in Europe of U.S. intelligence practices, straining trans-Atlantic ties and hindering cooperation between Washington and Brussels in other areas.  U.S. tech companies also came under scrutiny from the broader public following the revelations. That is one reason Microsoft is fighting so hard: to maintain its reputation. Microsoft says it has only provided data to the U.S. government under valid legal orders.  \u201cPre-Snowden, this would have been done quietly, there would have been an accommodation\u201d between Microsoft and the government, said James A. Lewis, a senior vice president at the Center for Strategic & International Studies, a Washington-based think tank. \u201cEveryone would have gone away happy.\u201d  Now, \u201cthey need to show the world, their global customer base, that they\u2019re not just going to roll over every time the U.S. government asks them for something,\u201d he said.

But the measure drew widespread criticism from privacy and human-rights activists, who suggested U.S. tech companies\u2014under pressure in Washington\u2014had retreated on the issue. They also suggested the bill could leave data stored in the U.S. vulnerable to demands by authoritarian foreign governments.  The measure, known as the Cloud Act, would create a legal framework for resolving the frequent conflicts that have sprung up recently over the issue.  It would amend U.S. law to make clear that law-enforcement warrants can apply to data that U.S.-based tech companies store anywhere in the world. But the act also would give companies a right to challenge warrants in court based on privacy laws in the specific country where the data are stored.  It also would allow for bilateral agreements between the U.S. and other countries over how to deal with disputes in the future, including other countries\u2019 requests for data in the U.S.  The issue has come up more frequently in recent years, as big U.S. tech companies have stored more data overseas. One problem fueling the conflicts is that the 1986 federal law in question, the Stored Communications Act, is ill-suited to current cross-border data-storage practices.  In one case pending before the Supreme Court, a federal appeals court sided with Microsoft Corp. in holding that warrants for customer data can\u2019t be enforced on U.S. providers if the data are stored overseas.  The Justice Department and state attorneys general say the lower-court ruling has hindered investigations into an array of crimes, from narcotics trafficking to arson to child pornography. Electronic evidence is now critical to virtually every criminal investigation, they say.  But Microsoft, Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google unit and other technology companies have argued the Justice Department\u2019s position would leave them caught in the middle between U.S. law-enforcement demands and their obligation to abide by privacy laws in foreign jurisdictions.  The Justice Department applied for a warrant requiring Microsoft to turn over email information from an account allegedly tied to illegal drug activity in the U.S. Microsoft handed over some account data that were stored in the U.S. but said it shouldn\u2019t have to hand over the emails, which were stored on a server in Ireland.  The companies say the case ultimately could threaten American dominance in the $250 billion cloud-computing industry, because foreign clients won\u2019t use U.S. firms if their data aren\u2019t protected.  The enactment of the Cloud legislation might leave little for the Supreme Court to decide in the Microsoft case. When the court heard oral arguments in February, multiple justices said congressional intervention would be welcome.  \"It would be good if Congress enacted legislation that modernized this,\u201d Justice Samuel Alito said.  Tech groups criticized the new measure\u2019s implications for privacy in several respects, casting it as a surrender of sorts in the wake of the Microsoft case.  \"The Cloud Act is a disappointing outcome after so many human-rights groups weighed in on the Microsoft case at the U.S. Supreme Court,\u201d said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center.  EPIC and other groups had pushed for many updates to the 1980s-era privacy law, he said, \u201cbut they were ignored.\u201d Greg Nojeim of the Center for Democracy and Technology said the deal gives the Justice Department too much leeway to open up U.S. data to authoritarian foreign governments.  \u201cDOJ could use this legislation to diminish privacy rights world-wide, or to persuade other governments to raise their surveillance standards in order to qualify for an agreement,\u201c he said. \u201dWe fear the U.S. Congress hasn\u2019t done enough to require DOJ to make the right decisions.\u201d  \u201cThe internet industry applauds Congress for including the Cloud Act in the omnibus spending bill,\u201d said Melika Carroll, a senior vice president for the Internet Association, a trade group representing big tech companies. \u201cIt\u2019s critical that we modernize U.S. privacy laws to reflect current realities of how data is stored around the world. Passing the Cloud Act will enable law enforcement to gather data stored abroad for the purposes of investigating serious crimes, while still protecting individual privacy rights.\u201d  \u2014Brent Kendall contributed to this article.

The tax is due regardless of whether they bring it home or not, though companies may choose to pay it over eight years. Businesses must generally book this tax as a one-time charge in the final quarter of 2017. Apple said this month it would pay $38 billion in taxes and return the majority of its overseas cash to the U.S.  The taxes companies pay on these profits will vary somewhat, depending on both the size of the profits and how they have been invested. Companies must pay 15.5% on liquid assets, such as cash and a variety of marketable securities, and 8% on other assets. Technology companies tend to have a larger amount of liquid assets as a share of their overseas stockpile than other industries: For instance, 95% of networking giant Cisco Systems Inc.\u2019s accumulated foreign profit last year was in cash and cash equivalents, versus 22% for retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc.  The Wall Street Journal estimated that 311 large publicly traded companies could generate nearly $250 billion in these taxes, of which 38% could be paid by tech companies.  Tax rates  Tech giants generally enjoy low effective tax rates because a portion of their profits accumulate in low-tax foreign jurisdictions. Tech firms paid an average tax rate of 24% over the 10-year period through 2016, below the 29% average tax rate for all companies in the S&P 500 for that period and lower than any other industry, according to an analysis of corporate filings by Zion Research Group.

That means firms like Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Cisco Systems, which over the past decade have paid lower tax rates on average than the new statutory rate of 21%, may soon see their rates go up. International Business Machines Inc., which paid a tax rate of 12% last year excluding one-time benefits, said this month its rate will rise to as much as 18% in 2018.  The five biggest tech companies\u2014 Apple Inc., Alphabet, Microsoft Corp. , Amazon.com Inc. and Facebook Inc. \u2014all report earnings this week and investors will be looking for guidance on tax rates.  Use of capital  Now that companies are free to bring foreign cash to the U.S. at no added cost, they will be dogged with the question of how they plan to spend it. Tech firms are already among the biggest spenders on research and development and on acquisitions. Adding to these budgets may not be the answer.

The Republicans sold the tax overhaul on the promise that it would return investment to the U.S., not to enrich shareholders.  \u201cIt will be interesting to see what companies ultimately do with more unfettered access to their global cash,\u201d said Kirsten Malm, a partner at law firm Baker McKenzie who advises tech firms on taxes. \u201cIs this going to set off a new wave of M&A? Will we see share buybacks? Maybe not, because share prices are so high at the moment.\u201d  Borrowing  With most of their cash sitting offshore, tech giants have increasingly issued debt to finance their growth and return money to shareholders.

FILE PHOTO: A Google search page is seen through a magnifying glass in this photo illustration taken in Berlin, August 11, 2015.

Google said it was also is considering new labeling so its users could see when a featured answer is an imperfect match based on a proximate question.  Other changes announced by Google last year were aimed at helping stem conspiracy theories and offensive information from making it into the highlighted results, which Google calls \u201cfeatured snippets.\u201d  Google typically plucks snippets from third-party websites and shows them in a large box before the traditional list of links in search results. Snippets are relied on by Google\u2019s virtual assistant to read out answers to searches conducted through smart speakers such as the Google Home.

But users ultimately want to know how reptiles rate as pets one way or the other. The featured snippet for \u201care reptiles bad pets\u201d would be valuable too even if it contradicts the first snippet, he said.

Now it wants to take a cut of their purchases, too.  The U.S. technology company is teaming up with retailers including Target Corp (TGT.N), Walmart Inc (WMT.N), Home Depot Inc (HD.N), Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) and Ulta Beauty Inc (ULTA.O).  Under a new program, retailers can list their products on Google Search, as well as on the Google Express shopping service, and Google Assistant on mobile phones and voice devices.  In exchange for Google listings and linking to retailer loyalty programs, the retailers pay Google a piece of each purchase, which is different from payments that retailers make to place ads on Google platforms.  The listings will appear under sponsored shopping results and will not affect regular search results on Google, the company said.  Google\u2019s pitch to retailers is a better chance to influence shoppers\u2019 purchasing decisions, a move that is likely to help them compete with rival Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O). Google hopes the program helps retailers capture more purchases on desktop, cell phones and smart home devices with voice search \u2013 the next frontier for e-commerce.  The previously unreported initiative sprang from Google\u2019s observation that tens of millions of consumers were sending image searches of products, asking \u201cWhere can I buy this?\u201d \u201cWhere can I find it?\u201d \u201cHow can I buy it?\u201d \u201cHow do I transact?\u201d Daniel Alegre, Google\u2019s president for retail and shopping, told Reuters exclusively.  Over the past two years, mobile searches asking where to buy products soared by 85 percent, Alegre said.  But the current default choice for many consumers is a Google search that ends with an Amazon purchase, analysts said. The new Google program, Shopping Actions, will be available in the United States to retailers of all sizes and could help retail chains keep those customers.  \u201cWe have taken a fundamentally different approach from the likes of Amazon because we see ourselves as an enabler of retail,\u201d Alegre said. \u201cWe see ourselves as part of a solution for retailers to be able to drive better transactions ... and get closer to the consumer.\u201d For consumers faced with a surfeit of choices, the idea is to make online buying easier by giving them a single shopping cart and instant checkout \u2013 a core feature of Amazon\u2019s retail dominance.  Retail chains can also offer products through the Google Home voice shopping device, holding on to those who may be headed to Amazon for better deals and giving them personalized recommendations based on previous purchase history.  A man checks Google devices outside its booth at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, February 27, 2018. REUTERS/Sergio Perez  For example, a shopper looking for sneakers on Google on his phone can see a retailer\u2019s listing and add that to his Google Express cart. Later, the customer can stand in the kitchen, and use the Google Home voice device to add paper towels to the same cart and buy everything at once.  Retail partners saw the average size of a customer\u2019s shopping basket increase by 30 percent, Alegre said, pointing to early results from the Shopping Actions program.  Ulta Beauty\u2019s average order value has jumped 35 percent since partnering with Google, Chief Executive Officer Mary Dillon said. Ulta sells makeup and skin care products from brands such as MAC, Estee Lauder (EL.N) and Clinique.  Over the past six months, Target said the number of items in shoppers\u2019 Google Express baskets have increased by nearly 20 percent, on average, as a result of its tie-up with the internet company.  ENEMY OF MY ENEMY IS MY FRIEND  The retailers are also eager to get in on the rapidly growing voice shopping market dominated by Amazon\u2019s popular Echo home device, analysts and consultants said.  Both Walmart and Target last year struck deals to appear in search results via Google Home.  Smart voice devices like Amazon Echo and Google Home will be installed in 55 percent of U.S. households by 2022, according to Juniper Research.

Now it wants to take a cut of their purchases, too.  The U.S. technology company is teaming up with retailers including Target Corp, Walmart Inc, Home Depot Inc, Costco Wholesale Corp and Ulta Beauty Inc.  Under a new program, retailers can list their products on Google Search, as well as on the Google Express shopping service, and Google Assistant on mobile phones and voice devices.  In exchange for Google listings and linking to retailer loyalty programs, the retailers pay Google a piece of each purchase, which is different from payments that retailers make to place ads on Google platforms.  The listings will appear under sponsored shopping results and will not affect regular search results on Google, the company said.  Google\u2019s pitch to retailers is a better chance to influence shoppers\u2019 purchasing decisions, a move that is likely to help them compete with rival Amazon.com Inc. Google hopes the program helps retailers capture more purchases on desktop, cell phones and smart home devices with voice search \u2013 the next frontier for e-commerce.  The previously unreported initiative sprang from Google\u2019s observation that tens of millions of consumers were sending image searches of products, asking \u201cWhere can I buy this?\u201d \u201cWhere can I find it?\u201d \u201cHow can I buy it?\u201d \u201cHow do I transact?\u201d Daniel Alegre, Google\u2019s president for retail and shopping, told Reuters exclusively.  Over the past two years, mobile searches asking where to buy products soared by 85 percent, Alegre said.  But the current default choice for many consumers is a Google search that ends with an Amazon purchase, analysts said. The new Google program, Shopping Actions, will be available in the United States to retailers of all sizes and could help retail chains keep those customers.  \u201cWe have taken a fundamentally different approach from the likes of Amazon because we see ourselves as an enabler of retail,\u201d Alegre said. \u201cWe see ourselves as part of a solution for retailers to be able to drive better transactions ... and get closer to the consumer.\u201d  For consumers faced with a surfeit of choices, the idea is to make online buying easier by giving them a single shopping cart and instant checkout \u2013 a core feature of Amazon\u2019s retail dominance.  Retail chains can also offer products through the Google Home voice shopping device, holding on to those who may be headed to Amazon for better deals and giving them personalized recommendations based on previous purchase history.  For example, a shopper looking for sneakers on Google on his phone can see a retailer\u2019s listing and add that to his Google Express cart. Later, the customer can stand in the kitchen, and use the Google Home voice device to add paper towels to the same cart and buy everything at once.  Retail partners saw the average size of a customer\u2019s shopping basket increase by 30 percent, Alegre said, pointing to early results from the Shopping Actions program.  Ulta Beauty\u2019s average order value has jumped 35 percent since partnering with Google, Chief Executive Officer Mary Dillon said. Ulta sells makeup and skin care products from brands such as MAC, Estee Lauder and Clinique.  Over the past six months, Target said the number of items in shoppers\u2019 Google Express baskets have increased by nearly 20 percent, on average, as a result of its tie-up with the internet company.  ENEMY OF MY ENEMY IS MY FRIEND  The retailers are also eager to get in on the rapidly growing voice shopping market dominated by Amazon\u2019s popular Echo home device, analysts and consultants said.  Both Walmart and Target last year struck deals to appear in search results via Google Home.  Smart voice devices like Amazon Echo and Google Home will be installed in 55 percent of U.S. households by 2022, according to Juniper Research. Amazon\u2019s Alexa platform could generate $10 billion in revenues by 2020, a separate report from RBC Capital Markets estimated.  \u201cBrands are looking at Google as the enemy of the enemy and that makes Google their friend,\u201d said Guru Hariharan, CEO of retail technology firm Boomerang Commerce, referring to the competition between Amazon and chains like Walmart and Target.

Yet Google almost pulled it off in just under seven years.  On March 5, nine-year-old restaurant guide Infatuation announced it was buying the Zagat brand for an undisclosed amount. The company\u2014best known for its #eeeeeats hashtag\u2014now controls the 35-year-old Zagat name and its international catalog of reviews.  For some, the question isn\u2019t why Google sold off Zagat; it\u2019s what took so long. The relationship between the two companies had been troubled for years. The 2011 purchase was championed by former Google executive Marissa Mayer, who saw Zagat as an asset for the maps division she controlled. But by 2013, some reviewers panned the release of the Zagat app, which had a difficult user interface and seemed designed to push content such as \u201cRose for Every Mood: What to Bring to Any Summer Occasion,\u201d rather than help people find a good place to eat.    Then, a few years ago, Google chose to infuse its mapping services with features such as user-generated restaurant reviews, rather than leveraging Zagat and its resources. It was a defensive move to ward off rivals such as Yelp Inc. and Apple Inc., which were then credible threats to Google\u2019s dominance in local information. Zagat, meanwhile, was left to wither.  The end of an era.  How did this happen? When Mayer departed in 2012, Zagat was left without a champion at Google, according to a former Zagat contractor who requested anonymity. Instead of hiring additional full-time staff, Google relied on contractors for content and assigned a minimal number of engineers for such major projects as the app launch and a 2017 web redesign, according to several people who worked for Zagat at the time. Gradually, the number of contractors working on Zagat content decreased\u2014there were just over a dozen to cover the globe\u2014and coverage of notable cities such as London and Toronto was suspended.  Google declined a request for comment.  Eventually, the staff was told to de-emphasize reviews, which were the backbone of the business. Instead, employees were directed to focus on boilerplate guide lists, such as \u201cBest Brunch\u201d and \u201cBest After Work Drinks.\u201d The changes left the remaining staff frustrated, according to the former contractor.  Tim and Nina Zagat founded their eponymous guide as a hobby in 1979. The couple, having met at Yale Law School, started the business after a guest criticized a newspaper\u2019s restaurant reviews at a dinner party. The Zagats began soliciting friends\u2019 opinions and found 200 amateur critics to rate 100 restaurants for food, d\u00e9cor, service, and costs. An empire was born. For years, the Zagat guide was part of the calculus of figuring out where you were going to eat.    Those days are long gone. By 2017, Zagat failed even to send out its annual survey\u2014the basis for its restaurant rankings. No guide was produced, and no explanation was given.  Flashback. Photographer: Paul Taggart  Zagat freelancers weren\u2019t notified of the Infatuation deal beforehand, according to a current contractor who requested anonymity. Instead, they were told on Friday night that security was being updated and that they would be locked out of Zagat tools, the contractor says. By Monday morning, they were given the press release.    Infatuation didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. In a statement, the site said it will operate Zagat as a separate brand, with a new, tech-driven platform that will be an alternative to other crowdsourced restaurant reviews.  In October, Google held its second Local Guides Summit in San Francisco. The program encourages users of the company\u2019s Maps app to upload photos and write reviews of places such as restaurants and to submit new locations. During the summit, Google announced that 50 million people were contributing to the program, a 1,000 percent increase from the 5 million it tracked in early 2016. More than 700,000 venues are being added to Maps each month, according to the company. Maps has more than 1 billion users, making it a lot more efficient and broader than Zagat\u2019s restaurant-review system.  \u201cI assume Google figured out that they didn\u2019t need the brand name in order to surface the information,\u201d said restaurateur Nick Kokonas, whose Alinea dining room topped the list in the 2012 Chicago Zagat guide. \u201cAt the end of the day, Google can get all that Zagat information without actually owning Zagat, right?\u201d  \u2014 With assistance by Mark Bergen", "stock": "GOOGL", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-07", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-07/here-s-how-google-almost-destroyed-zagat"}, {"article": "People are spending more time on Google products like YouTube than on Facebook #tictocnews  Facebook Inc. lost ground to Google in January as users spent more time on YouTube and other Alphabet Inc. properties, according to a report.  Brian Wieser, a Pivotal Research analyst who reviewed Nielsen digital consumption data, said Google properties, including YouTube and Waze, combined to account for 27.4 percent of all time spent on digital media -- up 3 percentage points from the previous year. By contrast, Facebook\u2019s share of time spent fell about 2 points to 16.3 percent over the same period.  Facebook depends on people coming back frequently so it can collect data and use it to target ads at them. The company said in the fourth quarter that people were spending less time on the site after Facebook began shifting users\u2019 news feeds back toward posts from friends and family and away from businesses and media outlets. But if the trend continues, investors could take it as a sign that users are losing interest in Facebook.  Nielsen published its Digital Content Ratings on Tuesday. YouTube accounts for half of all Google activity and continues to draw consumption well in excess of 20 percent year-over-year every month, Weiser said. Other Google properties expanded by 33 percent.  Facebook\u2019s main site lost 5 percent in time spent, despite a 4 percent increase in the number of users. That amounts to an 8 percent decline per person, Weiser said. Instagram, a Facebook property, did much better with a 7 percent increase in time per user.

Publishers will keep 85 percent to 95 percent of revenue when readers first buy subscriptions via Google, up from 70 percent previously, according to people with knowledge of the matter.  Publishers\u2019 feelings toward Silicon Valley are starting to shift as some technology companies are showing they want to compete for content. Last week, Apple Inc. offered an olive branch to the media industry by buying Texture, a digital service that lets users subscribe to more than 200 magazines for $9.99 a month. Apple and Google are trying to seize on a moment when Facebook\u2019s ties with news outlets have soured.  The relationship between news providers and \u201cthe major digital platforms -- how they think about content, how they think about publishers, how they think about data -- feels more in flux right now than it has in a long time,\u201d Mark Thompson, chief executive officer of the New York Times Co., said in an interview.  The new financial terms are part of \u201cSubscribe with Google,\u201d a feature that gives media companies data and tools to find and keep subscribers. It was one of several announcements the search giant made in New York on Tuesday to appease publishers whose content helps Google sell advertising.  \"Our mission is inherently tied to your mission,\" Philipp Schindler, Google\u2019s chief business officer, told a room of media executives.  Subscriber Tool  When consumers sign up for a subscription using \u201cSubscribe with Google\u201d at a publisher\u2019s website, Google will keep just 5 percent of the revenue, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing nonpublic information. If they use the tool at the Google Play Store, that goes up to 15 percent.  On Tuesday, Google said it would share data to help identify potential paying readers and that users\u2019 search results would more prominently feature publications they subscribe to. The company also said it would dole out $300 million to support digital journalism globally over the next three years.  \u201cWe welcome the fact that Google has listened to and responded to some of our asks about our subscription business,\u201d Thompson said. He also said he\u2019d like to see Google and others share advertising revenue with publishers, since the tech companies make big profits by selling online ads around other providers\u2019 news content.  \u201cAny kind of comprehensive solution to do with sustaining quality journalism on these major platforms will have to consider the advertising side of the equation as well,\u201d Thompson said.  Boost Relations  Apple\u2019s purchase of Texture last week was that company\u2019s latest effort to boost relations with news outlets. Apple once touted the iPad as a potential savior for the industry, which has struggled for years with declining subscribers and print advertising. In 2011, News Corp. created an iPad-only newspaper called The Daily, but shut it down in less than two years after failing to find a big enough audience.  Conde Nast President Bob Sauerberg said he\u2019s optimistic Apple\u2019s acquisition will start a new chapter that will benefit his stable of glossy magazines, which include Wired and The New Yorker. Conde Nast was a co-owner of Texture.  \u201cThey have big ambitions,\u201d Sauerberg said.  Sauerberg said not all tech giants have put publishers at the top of their priority lists, but for now, \u201cI feel really good we\u2019re at the top of the list for Apple and for Google.\u201d  IPhone App  Apple\u2019s focus with publishers has been on distributing their stories on Apple News, an app that comes installed on millions of iPhones. Media executives say Apple News could be a significant source of online readership. But so far they\u2019ve seen little money from it.  Apple News is a way to attract more Times readers, especially outside the U.S., \u201cbut without significant economics attached,\u201d Thompson said. The Times distributes articles on Apple News, but is not participating in the subscription program.  Facebook, meanwhile, has sent mixed signals to publishers. In October, the world\u2019s largest social network began a test to support paywalls in Instant Articles and letting publishers keep all the revenue from subscriptions. In February, it launched a three-month pilot program to help local newspapers attract more subscribers.  But the company has also said its algorithm will start prioritizing News Feed posts from friends and families, hurting publishers\u2019 web traffic.  \u201cGoogle has been the most responsive of the major platforms in terms of listening, trying to understand what we need, and changing their business rules,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cWe\u2019ve not seen that kind of responsiveness from Facebook at all, actually.\u201d  \u2014 With assistance by Mark Gurman", "stock": "GOOGL", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-20", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-20/google-said-to-sweeten-deals-with-publishers-as-tech-woos-media"}, {"article": "John Giannandrea, the head of Google\u2019s cornerstone web-search unit, is stepping down from his role.

The deal will help Google design more of its own consumer hardware and could set it up to wade deeper into special-purpose chips -- like Apple. Google\u2019s most recent Pixel model came with a new image processor to improve the device\u2019s camera. More of this \"custom silicon\" will come in the future, Google\u2019s hardware chief Rick Osterloh said in an interview.  Osterloh brought in HTC engineers and designers to help Google control more of the design and production of its products, including working more closely with suppliers. Google previously focused on software and let manufacturers including Samsung Electronics Co. and HTC handle the hardware. But modern phones offer features like augmented reality and artificial intelligence-based services that require close integration of software and hardware.  \"You have to be vertical in some cases to really push the envelope for consumers,\" Osterloh said. \"Our intention is to invest in this for the long term. You\u2019ll see a steady increase in investment from us.\"  HTC said in a separate statement that it plans to proceed with its next flagship smartphone and will focus its efforts in the segment. \u201cToday marks the beginning of an exciting new chapter at HTC as we continue to drive innovation in our branded smartphone and VIVE virtual reality businesses,\u201d Cher Wang, chairwoman at HTC said in the statement.  For Google, a bigger step would be to create its own \"system-on-a-chip\" -- the main processors inside phones that Apple now inserts into its devices. Qualcomm Inc. provides the bulk of these chips to Android phone makers, and Osterloh said Google will keep working with the supplier for the foreseeable future.  Still, by designing more silicon itself, Google could cut business for other suppliers. Apple released its first system-on-a-chip in 2010, and has added special chips to store fingerprint and payment data, track motion, crunch graphics and run AI algorithms on mobile devices.  Google\u2019s Pixel sales have been a fraction of Apple\u2019s, but another phone maker designing more of its own components is a bad sign for suppliers. Dialog Semiconductor Plc slumped last month after telling investors that Apple, its biggest customer, could design its own power-management chips. Imagination Technologies Group Plc suffered a similar fate last year after Apple stopped buying the U.K. company\u2019s graphics chips in favor of in-house designs.  The HTC deal is also bad news for manufacturers of phones based on Google\u2019s Android operating system. Most of these companies have struggled to make money selling premium handsets that compete with the iPhone, while Google benefited from distributing search and other lucrative software services on those devices. Now Google is making its own high-end smartphones. The Pixel phone sold 1.5 million phones in 2017, up from 1 million the year before, according to Counterpoint Research. By contrast, Samsung is estimated to have shipped more than 300 million smartphone units last year.  If Android partners aren\u2019t alienated by Google\u2019s entrance, they are at least uneasy. After the Pixel arrived, some major Android manufacturers, like Samsung and Huawei Technologies Co., began to roll out more of their own services on their phones.  Other Android manufacturers \"know why we\u2019re doing this,\" Osterloh said. \"Quite honestly, Apple is doing really well in developed markets.\"  After the HTC deal, Google plans to expand research and marketing, cut deals with more phone carriers and retailers, and move into new markets. Sales remain limited to nine countries, including the U.S., Germany and Singapore.  \"China is obviously a very attractive smartphone market and we\u2019re certainly interested in going back to China in the future, but we don\u2019t have any plans to discuss and frankly it\u2019s complicated for the company,\" he said. Google pulled its services from mainland China in 2010 after refusing to censor its search results.  If Google\u2019s push into smartphones sounds familiar, that\u2019s because the latest deal echoes Google\u2019s $12.5 billion acquisition of Motorola Mobility in 2012. That experiment flopped. Google never integrated the business and sold most of it to Lenovo Group Ltd. for $2.91 billion. In a blog post, Alphabet CEO Larry Page said Motorola would be better off with a company that\u2019s \"all-in when it comes to making mobile devices.\"  Osterloh knows the history well. He was at Motorola after the purchase and stayed on to run it for the Chinese company.  So what makes things different this time around? \"The context, the time, it\u2019s a different world than it was during the PC-era,\" said Osterloh.

The big question is whether investors are overestimating the companies' ability to keep expanding their dominance.  The Alphabet Inc. unit and Facebook Inc. pulled in a combined $114 billion in revenue from advertisements in 2017, excluding the money that Google turns over to partners such as Apple. That means more than one out of every five dollars in the $500 billion global advertising market goes to Google and Facebook, based on Magna Global estimates of worldwide ad spending. Excluding advertising sales in China, where neither company has made much headway, Google and Facebook are responsible for about 25 percent of annual advertising revenue.  That's impressive, right? The companies grew into beasts because they changed how businesses from Ford to the corner coffee shop pitched to their customers. The local Yellow Pages, newspapers and magazines all lost advertising sales to varying degrees to Google and Facebook, which offered businesses a more efficient and effective way to persuade people to buy pickup trucks or drop by the store. In 2017, about 40 percent of all global advertising revenue was spent online, up from 20 percent six years earlier, the Magna estimates show. Google and Facebook led that shift and benefited from it more than any other companies.  Ad Assault Google and Facebook's combined advertising revenue is equivalent to 22 percent of the global ad market Data: Magna Global, Bloomberg Intelligence and company disclosures; graphic by Bloomberg Gadfly  But it gets harder for Google and Facebook from here, and it's not clear that the companies' stock market values reflect the difficulties of their mission. Both companies need to continue to grab advertising from television, radio and other places where businesses try to reach customers and expand into areas other than what is considered conventional consumer advertising. I'm more sanguine about the former than the latter.  First, I'll tackle the companies' market share task. The Magna data show that global advertising spending has increased an average of less than 5 percent annually since 2011, a bit faster than the expansion of the global economy over that period. Google and Facebook ad revenue has grown much faster -- 18 percent and 49 percent in 2017, respectively. In other words, the growth of Google and Facebook hasn't come so much from an increase in the total advertising pie but from grabbing bigger slices from other media.  To keep growing, Google and Facebook need to continue to expand their market share of the advertising pie. That's one reason why Google and Facebook are each trying to encroach on the turf of television, the source of $175 billion in annual advertising spending worldwide. But increasing their ad market share isn't enough.  Let's assume Google and Facebook expand their share of global advertising revenue excluding China to 40 percent in 2022 from the current 25 percent. That would work out to an estimated $216 billion in combined advertising revenue for Google and Facebook, based on Magna's ad market forecasts. That's a 14 percent compound annual growth rate for the companies, which would be a significant deceleration. Google and Facebook's combined advertising sales have grown 22 percent to 28 percent a year since 2014.  Advertising Royalty Google and Facebook's ad sales are growing much more quickly than the total advertising market. Growth rates for each: Data: Company disclosures and Magna Global via Bloomberg Intelligence; graphic by Bloomberg Gadfly  To grow at the rate investors expect, then, Google and Facebook need \"moonshots.\" I'm not necessarily talking about autonomous cars, technology to let people hear through their skin and other projects the companies are cooking up in their science labs. Google and Facebook need moonshots in their primary business of advertising, too.  That could mean expanding into what is thought of as marketing, such as the email messages and coupons that companies pay to send to their customers. It could be selling software used by marketing departments, as Adobe and Salesforce provide now. Or Google and Facebook could find ways to take a slice of revenue when they refer people to buy from local merchants. Those are all ways Google and Facebook could tap large pools of revenue outside of but adjacent to their core advertising businesses.  It's possible each company could continue to thrive just by sticking to advertising. The companies have grabbed more ad market share than many people expected, and that could continue. Both companies are also trying to diversify into non-ad areas such as virtual reality and cloud computing.  For the foreseeable future, though, Google and Facebook are reliant on advertising. Alphabet generates 86 percent of its revenue from advertising; at Facebook the figure is 98 percent. The companies may be running out of room to grow before they hit a ceiling in advertising. And that may flip their iron grip on advertising from a strength to a vulnerability.

Columbus actually wanted to find a faster way to India and discovered America. The situation is similar for a German asset manager in the 21st century. For years, he has been trading successfully on the basis of an options strategy. Then he asks his IT administrator to test new strategies. Unplanned they develop an artificial intelligence that has recently become the manager of a new fund by the company.  The Frankfurt based asset manager Wallrich Wolf Asset Management AG has been in business with their short-options-fund for ten years. The portfolio managers regularly sell put options and earn the option premium. Until 2011 the fund was fully invested most of the time, which provided steady income, but did not allow scope for new positions when volatility increased.  Managing director Stefan Wallrich was keen to know, what strategies and optimizations work and asked his IT administrator, who is actually responsible for the maintenance of computers and servers, to support him in a so-called backtest. A backtest is a common practice in portfolio management to try new ideas or optimize existing ones. 20 strategies were calculated by Wallrich back to the year 2008. Among other things, this showed that, in principle, a variable degree of exposure in the portfolio, depending on the current market volatility, produces good results.  \"Until then, I was happy with the results, because I just wanted to backtest some strategies to optimize our existing fund,\" says Wallrich, who manages more than 350 million euros ($427 million) with his team in various portfolios. But then came the big \"enlightment\".  Which degree of investment is the right one? Wallrich\u2019s IT expert Marcel Heintz developed an artificial intelligence that constantly calculates different investment levels, checks them and questions the results. The machine is given the requirement to keep a portion of the portfolio permanently invested in order to generate regular income through the option sale and at the same time, depending on the level of volatility, to move the investment level up or down. With low volatility, less investment should be made and, with high volatility and thus high premiums, even more than 100 percent of the portfolio should be invested. Otherwise the machine is free to decided on the degree of investment by itself.  \"The AI \u200b\u200bconstantly assesses its results and questions how it came to the conclusion and how it can do even better in the future,\" explains Sebastian Franz, who was involved in the development as a DHBW-student.  Artificial intelligence technology differs from the more traditional quant investment approch, in that it mimics the human brain\u2019s learning capacity. When new data comes in, the algorithm modifies its behavior. A machine detects non-linear patterns, without the help of a human being.  More about AI with asset managers:  This AI-Robot Picks Stocks Based on Millions of Human Emotions  \u2019Warren in a Box\u2019 Picks Stocks for First Nordic AI Fund  QuickTake: Artificial Intelligence  After a year of research and convincing results, Wallrich decides to give it a try and in December 2017 launches a new fund, which is managed only by the AI.  \"We could have used the computer in our traditional strategy, but in order to give the topic the attention it deserves, we decided to launch a new fund,\" says Wallrich. \"Also to distinguish the AI from the old fund and to be able to evaluate the success in the long term.\"  The fund currently manages 7 million euros ($8.5 million) and, like most AI funds, is still at the beginning. For Wallrich, the AI topic is not a revolution, but an evolution, and he wants to further improve the \"intelligence factor\" in the coming months.  New Intelligence AI funds are still young but already manage millions Source: Bloomberg  For example, one could extend the AI \u200b\u200bby additional volatility variables or check how exchange rates or macroeconomic data change the decision path of the machine. In addition, it would be possible to launch several funds with basically the same strategy but different risk-return profiles. With the AI \u200b\u200bit is possible to manage several different portfolios cost-effectively and with less highly qualified portfolio managers.  In 2018 he aims for a fund volume of 15 million euros. In the medium term, \"it can and should become significantly more,\" says Wallrich. However, that depends on the success of the AI \u200b\u200bstrategy. \"If it works, of which I\u2019m very confident, the volume could sky rocket.\"  One has to go with the time and competition makes it necessary to stay innovative, Wallrich says. He could think of abandoning the classic portfolio management completely at some point and leave the money management fully to the machine. \"The machine is simply better at many things, while we have emotional discussions in our portfolio management team,\" Wallrich says.

Google co-founder Larry Page and futurist Ray Kurzweil could be among your lecturers in the Graduate Studies Program at Singularity, named for the notion that humans will someday merge with machines. You\u2019d work in a kind of combination think tank and startup incubator, trying to address challenges as grand as renewable energy and space travel. Kurzweil announced the program during a TED Talk in 2009, adding that the Singularity team had leased its campus from NASA, just east of the agency\u2019s historic Hangar One in Mountain View, Calif. The team received 1,200 applications for its first class of 40 later that year.  Reality hasn\u2019t matched the hype. Previously unreported police files, other documents, and interviews with current and former students and staff paint the picture that almost from the beginning, some Singularity staffers weren\u2019t able to curb their worst impulses. A teacher allegedly sexually assaulted a former student, an executive stole more than $15,000, a former staffer alleges gender and disability discrimination, and Singularity dismissed 14 of about 170 staffers and suspended GSP, now called the Global Solutions Program, after Google withdrew funding last year.  Alumni say for-profit Singularity is becoming just another organizer of conferences and executive seminars. It\u2019s weighing buying the seminar company Abundance 360, started by Singularity co-founder Peter Diamandis. \u201cIt\u2019s lost its soul,\u201d says Vivek Wadhwa, who ran the faculty until 2013 and is at Carnegie Mellon University. \u201cIt\u2019s become a moneymaking corporation.\u201d  \u201cIf we want to make true impact \u2026 we need to do it in a sustainable fashion\u201d  While Singularity says it takes seriously its community\u2019s security and any related allegations, most of those matters are far in the past, says Chief Executive Officer Rob Nail. He says he was already planning to suspend and reevaluate GSP before Google ended its annual grant of $1.5 million. The grant covered about half the costs of the program, which was free for participants. Google, whose senior manager Jen Phillips left Singularity\u2019s advisory board late last year and won\u2019t be replaced, says it plans to focus on Singularity\u2019s entrepreneurship programs instead.  Nail says although GSP may be reborn largely online, conferences and executive education (tuition: $14,500 for a weeklong program) will become the bulk of Singularity\u2019s work. It held 10 conferences last year and has 18 planned for 2018. On Feb. 15 it announced it raised $32 million in venture funding led by Boeing Co. and investment firm WestRiver Group. Erik Anderson, WestRiver\u2019s CEO, is replacing Diamandis as Singularity\u2019s chairman. These changes, Nail says, will help the company turn a profit and thereby aid more people. \u201cIf we want to make true impact,\u201d he says, \u201cwe need to do it in a sustainable fashion.\u201d  Singularity had NASA connections beyond its rented buildings. Early GSP students speak highly of a lecture by former astronaut Dan Barry, a physician who got into the space shuttle program after 13 rejections. Several say they saw him as a mentor. Barry hasn\u2019t taught GSP students since 2013, when the company investigated him for allegedly sexually assaulting Yasemin Baydaroglu, a French student who attended GSP in 2011.  Baydaroglu says Barry arranged a 2013 meetup in Paris. They went for a bike ride, during which she complained of back pain, and then went to his hotel to chat. He reminded her he was a doctor, she says, and offered her a massage, speaking in strictly medical terms. Because he was a mentor, she trusted him\u2014until, she says, he touched her breasts and genitals, and she fled. \u201cI really didn\u2019t see it coming, and I\u2019m so careful,\u201d she says. \u201cThis time my guard was low.\u201d She reported the incident to police several days later, then visited a doctor.  \u201cI completely deny her accusations,\u201d Barry says, adding that the inquiries that followed led to \u201ca distressing time for me and my wife.\u201d  Baydaroglu showed signs of psychological distress that she said were linked to a physical assault, according to a copy of a May 31, 2013, doctor\u2019s report reviewed by Bloomberg Businessweek. According to a copy of a letter sent from France\u2019s Office of the Prosecutor, it declined to pursue the case because authorities hadn\u2019t been able to find Barry.  Singularity began its internal investigation after Baydaroglu separately reported the alleged assault to the company. Barry left that summer\u2019s program in June; his wife was ill, and the company told students he left for personal reasons. In a June 22, 2013, email to Baydaroglu reviewed by Bloomberg Businessweek, a Singularity human resources official told her Nail believed \u201cthe facts around the central allegation of unwanted sexual touching are inconclusive\u201d but that he told Barry the circumstances indicated \u201cpoor judgment.\u201d The official wrote that Barry wouldn\u2019t be present for the remainder of the 2013 GSP and asked Baydaroglu not to discuss the matter with other parties.  \u201cWe respectfully request that within the SU community, you keep our discussions and this conclusion confidential,\u201d the HR official wrote. She added that Baydaroglu shouldn\u2019t allow the company\u2019s investigation to influence her decision about civil or criminal legal processes, and offered company support for services such as counseling.  The email outlined steps Singularity was taking to reduce the likelihood of staffers being in \u201cpotentially intimate situations\u201d on campus, including prohibiting them from being alone with a student at the end of a program day and installing webcams to monitor classrooms. Baydaroglu says Singularity\u2019s response left her feeling deeply depressed and betrayed. Particularly galling, she says, was \u201casking me not to talk about it.\u201d The company declined to discuss the case except to say Barry hasn\u2019t been an active faculty member since 2013.  Singularity leaders have a history of shady financial practices. When the organization was in its infancy in 2009, Alicia Isaac, the financial controller, used its credit cards to make $13,500 in personal purchases; she also kept the cash from a $2,000 check to Singularity, according to a subsequent police report. And she helped the president of an artificial intelligence institute try to steal almost $80,000. Police arrested Isaac in 2009; she pleaded no contest to felony fraud charges. Isaac didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.  Another early Singularity architect, Bruce Klein, was convicted in 2012 of running a credit fraud operation in Alabama. He\u2019s no longer associated with the company. Board member Naveen Jain was convicted of insider trading in 2003. He appealed a $247 million judgment and ultimately settled.  Nail, who previously helped found an automation company, arrived in late 2011 with Chief Strategy Officer Gabriel Baldinucci, a former Virgin Group executive. They soon changed Singularity from a nonprofit to a for-profit B Corporation, which means a private accreditor certifies it meets certain social and environmental standards.  For years several staffers close to Baldinucci lived alongside him in a series of rented houses nicknamed the SU Villa, in Atherton and Woodside, Calif. Other employees say the group got favorable treatment and the general atmosphere was unfriendly to women. Eleanor Schuermann, a lawyer at Kastner Kim LLP, is representing a staffer who alleges Singularity discriminated against her because of her gender and disability, paid her less than men in the same position, and retaliated against her for complaining. The attorney\u2019s filings with state regulators, the first steps toward a lawsuit, aren\u2019t yet public record. Schuermann, who wouldn\u2019t name her client, says she\u2019s heard from two other Singularity employees about similar claims. The company declined to comment on the case but says it works hard to support women.  Singularity is a long way from 2009, when the first GSP led to the creation of Getaround, a car-sharing company that\u2019s raised $85 million from investors including Toyota Motor Corp. \u201cIt is amazing what all has happened here,\u201d Google\u2019s Page said during the program\u2019s opening ceremony the following year. \u201cIt exceeded all my expectations.\u201d These days, Page isn\u2019t involved with Singularity. Kurzweil doesn\u2019t dispute that while he attends board meetings, he rarely speaks.  Anderson, the new chairman, says the company expects to meet its revenue and social goals. Nail says it\u2019s making good on some of its grander ambitions, citing work on United Nations anti-hunger efforts. Still, he says, Singularity can do better: \u201cWe\u2019re nowhere near impacting the billion people our students talk about.\u201d", "stock": "GOOGL", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-15", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-15/silicon-valley-s-singularity-university-has-some-serious-reality-problems"}, {"article": "Connecting decision makers to a dynamic network of information, people and ideas, Bloomberg quickly and accurately delivers business and financial information, news and insight around the world.

Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos Can\u2019t Beat Washington, So He\u2019s Joining It: The Influence Game  In the final days of 2017, President Donald Trump attacked Amazon, tweeting that the U.S. Postal Service should charge the world's largest online retailer \"MUCH MORE!\" for delivering packages. It capped a year of criticism from Trump about Amazon's market power, impact on jobs and ties to the Washington Post, which Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos owns. While that Twitter barrage grabbed headlines, behind the scenes, the e-commerce giant was furiously expanding lobbying efforts that have quickly made it one of the most-influential companies in Washington, according to data compiled by Bloomberg News. In the past five years, Amazon increased lobbying spending by more than 400 percent, a rate of change that far exceeds rivals\u2019. It lobbied more government agencies than any other tech company, pressed its case on as many issues as Google, and outspent everyone in the industry except for the search giant, the data show. \"They quietly went from Chihuahua to Great Dane in just a few years,\" said Bruce Mehlman, a former top technology policy official under President George W. Bush.  Sources: Senate Office of Public Record, Bloomberg research  Amazon.com Inc. has good reasons to amplify its presence in Washington. Big tech's long honeymoon of public goodwill is over and the company feels the painful transition as much as competitors like Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Facebook Inc. Amazon is fighting to be seen as a job creator, not a job killer, and is often blamed when traditional retail outlets close. \"They are getting smacked right and left with questions about whether they are undermining sectors, harming local business opportunities, actually undercutting innovation, destroying jobs and harming democracy,\" said Gene Kimmelman, president of the policy group Public Knowledge. To counter that impression, Amazon is making both public and private moves. In public, Bezos meets with lawmakers and attended President Trump's awkward summit with technology CEOs at Trump Tower in late 2016. Before Trump\u2019s inauguration, the Amazon founder also pledged to hire 100,000 workers over the next 18 months, paying homage to Trump's push to get companies to employ more Americans. Gone is the feisty combativeness on display during the presidential election, when Bezos offered on Twitter to give candidate Trump a free ride off the planet with the hashtag #SendDonaldToSpace. Behind the scenes, Amazon has increased its lobbying of lawmakers and government agencies, which can keep a crackdown at bay. Last year, for example, for the first time in nearly two decades, Amazon lobbied the Justice Department, which has broad criminal and civil enforcement powers spanning antitrust, national security and corporate wrongdoing. What makes Amazon different from its tech brethren is the company\u2019s insatiable quest to sell everything from advertising to entertainment, groceries, computing power and soon, maybe even health care. That forces it to wrestle with a growing list of issues, including transportation, shipping, aviation, taxes, immigration and antitrust. Last year, it lobbied on 24 general issues (each of which could include dozens of laws or regulations), up from eight in 2012. Entities lobbied, such as the Senate and NASA, jumped from eight in 2012 to 39 in 2017. Microsoft Corp., which survived a prolonged antitrust case in the 1990s, lobbied on 18 issues and engaged with 29 government agencies last year. Amazon has fought for favorable rules regarding online sales taxes since 2000. But its rise as a Washington powerhouse really began amid a flurry of activity in 2013. That fall, Bezos acquired the Washington Post for $250 million from its longtime owners, the Graham family, and two months later, unveiled Prime Air, a nascent project to speed deliveries using drones. At the time, the Federal Aviation Administration required unmanned aircraft to be flown within the line of sight of operators. Amazon argued the rules were designed for hobbyists, not commercial operators.

Rather than give up, the company re-doubled its efforts to influence rule-making and policymakers. Amazon also set about expanding its physical presence in the capital. In 2014, the company traded its old Washington offices in a small townhouse near a highway exit with spotty Wi-Fi for a modern office building on the same street as lobbying powerhouses like the National Association of Realtors. The new digs, home to Amazon policy staff and other employees, have polished cement floors and an exhibit showcasing the company's growth from niche bookseller to titan of online commerce. From its comfortable new perch, Amazon rapidly expanded its lobbying efforts. It started lobbying the White House in 2014, according to federal disclosures, and has every year since. In 2015, it hired former Obama White House Press Secretary Jay Carney as senior vice president of corporate affairs. He now oversees the Washington policy office, which has almost doubled its number of registered lobbyists to 27 from two years ago. That roster does not include outside lobbyists like former Senator John Breaux, a Democrat, and his Republican partner, onetime Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott. \u201cAs one of the biggest job creators in the country, we\u2019ve expanded our team in Washington, D.C., to ensure we are able to cover the growing range of topics that are important to policymakers, our employees, and our customers,\u201d Brian Huseman, Amazon's vice president of public policy, said in a statement.  Amazon's lobbying spending grew the fastest Percent change in spending since 2012 Sources: Senate Office of Public Record, Bloomberg research  Winning friends in Washington has become a necessity for Amazon as it moves into more territory overseen by federal agencies. It's delivering groceries to food-stamp recipients in a trial run by the Agriculture Department. It handles hundreds of billions of dollars in transactions and lends money to small businesses selling goods on its site, requiring the company work with financial regulators. It lobbies for postal reform and infrastructure spending to get orders to customers more quickly. Amazon's cloud-computing business may have the most at stake. In 2013, it won a multi-year CIA contract, and is in the running for a decade-long Defense Department cloud contract potentially worth billions more. The Pentagon awarded a separate $950 million cloud contract to an Amazon affiliate earlier this month. The government seems pleased with these arrangements so far. The CIA's John Edwards delivered a 13-minute testimonial in June to thousands of people at an Amazon-sponsored event at Washington\u2019s convention center, saying partnering with Amazon Web Services is \u201cthe most innovative thing we\u2019ve ever done.\u201d In 2016, Bezos was appointed to the Defense Innovation Advisory Board, which aims to keep the Pentagon atop new technologies. He hosted Defense Secretary James Mattis at Amazon\u2019s Seattle headquarters in August, posting pictures of the visit on Twitter.

It has lobbied other federal agencies on issues related to cloud computing for at least six years, trying to change the way government buys and uses tech services. Amazon's most-recent effort focuses on music. It's supporting the Music Modernization Act, which would change the way artists and license holders get paid when people buy or stream digital music. Steve Boom, vice president of Amazon Music, worked the halls of Congress on the bill at the end of January.

The winner gets $5 billion in investment over 15 years and up to 50,000 jobs, making Amazon a welcome guest for lawmakers in those states \u2013 regardless of what issue the company wants to discuss. And Washington, Virginia and Maryland are all contenders. Along with his company\u2019s lobbying presence, Bezos has increased his personal visibility in Washington. In the fall of 2016, he bought the 27,000-square-foot former textile museum for an East Coast pied-\u00e0-terre. It's in the same tony Washington neighborhood where the Obamas, Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump live. He\u2019s planning salon-style dinners at the house with DC power-players and celebrities in the tradition of former Washington Post publisher Katharine Graham, according to a recent New York Times profile. \u201cI don\u2019t doubt that he loves journalism and thinks that \u2018Democracy Dies in the Dark,\u2019\u201d Scott Galloway, a professor at New York University, said, paraphrasing the newspaper\u2019s new motto. \u201cBut boy, it\u2019s convenient to have the Post and a home in Washington. These are incredibly powerful prophylactics.\"  Jeff Bezos stands for a photograph with Matt Damon, Taika Waititi, and Chris Hemsworth at Golden Globes event on Jan. 7, 2018.", "stock": "GOOGL", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-14", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-amazon-lobbying/"}, {"article": "On a recent night in San Francisco, the woman representing the Google engineer famously fired for arguing women aren\u2019t genetically suited to work in tech doesn\u2019t have it in her to attend a dinner of her peers. Those peers\u2014other San Francisco judges and attorneys\u2014run the spectrum, in her view, from liberal to far lefty. The sort of people she\u2019s surrounded by and specializes in riling up. But it can be exhausting.  \u201cIf I go today, I\u2019ll be devoured by judges and attorneys asking me how I could represent James,\u201d Harmeet Dhillon says of the annual bar association dinner. This was in January, months after her new client, James Damore, became an inescapable flashpoint in the workplace-gender war. Dhillon had just finished an interview on Fox News, where she makes regular appearances. She ditched the dinner and sat down for another interview instead.  Dhillon is a Republican in the People\u2019s Republic of Northern California. She\u2019s an outspoken supporter of President Donald Trump, and one of three elected leaders of the state\u2019s Republican National Committee.  She\u2019s a free-speech lawyer who argues the University of California at Berkeley stifled the First Amendment when it bumped a speech by conservative Ann Coulter. She doesn\u2019t believe in fake-news conspiracies and, in an appearance on Fox News, has denounced Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation as \u201cabsolutely\u201d corrupt. \u201cI didn\u2019t say Mueller was corrupt. But the investigation itself, it appears to be corrupt on many levels.\u201d  \u201cShe\u2019s a person of some dichotomy. On the one hand, she was on the board of the ACLU and fights for many individual rights,\u201d says Neel Chatterjee, a San Francisco lawyer who\u2019s known Dhillon since the 1980s. \u201cOn the other hand, she\u2019s a staunch Republican Trump supporter.\u201d And as Chatterjee notes: \u201cShe likes fighting political fights.\u201d  \u201cWhen Harmeet decided to lend her voice to the Trump campaign, there were, especially in the South Asian community, a lot of people who really questioned her integrity and her good faith,\u201d says Paul Grewal, a childhood friend and Facebook Inc.\u2019s general counsel. \u201cShe made very clear in the toughest moments of that campaign that what she was standing up for were her own conservative ideals.\u201d  In the legal complaint against Google, Harmeet Dhillon positions her client, James Damore, as someone in her own mold\u2014a conservative in a liberal bubble defending his rights. Photographer: Michael Liedtke/AP  Dhillon, 49, is in America\u2019s progressive hub summoning her own life experience to craft a novel legal argument that posits Damore in her own mold: a conservative in a liberal bubble demanding and using free-speech rights.  Dhillon won\u2019t say whether she agrees with her client\u2019s 3,000-word manifesto, the one Damore used to blast Google\u2019s diversity policies before he was fired. In it he asserts, among other things, that biological variances are a likely explanation for Silicon Valley\u2019s lopsided gender gap. But Dhillon does agree that Google\u2019s work culture crushes conservative ideology while promoting a liberal echo chamber. That ethos, she argues, is ultimately what fueled her client\u2019s termination.  Central to her case are a pair of 81-year-old sections of California\u2019s Labor Code that prohibit employers from controlling employees\u2019 political expression at work or firing them because of it. Where the U.S. Constitution\u2019s First Amendment ends, says Dhillon, California\u2019s statute begins.  Dhillon argues that Google\u2019s work culture changed in November 2016, after Trump\u2019s electoral victory. Within days the reality of his victory set in, and many Google employees were in a panic, \u201chaving expected a different outcome fully in line with their political views,\u201d Dhillon wrote in the 161-page complaint. The document mentions Trump nine times and uses the word \u201cconservative\u201d 101 times.  The lawsuit appears designed to maximally embarrass one of the world\u2019s biggest companies. One section of her complaint\u2014under the heading \u201cGoogle Failed to Protect Employees from Workplace Harassment Due to Their Support for President Trump\u201d\u2014decries unnamed managers for sabotaging the careers of conservative employees while promoting like-minded progressives, and in another instance, Google employees allegedly encouraged \u201cunambiguous social pecking\u201d of conservative white men. Later, she accuses Google of welcoming a diverse realm of alternative lifestyles on its internal message boards, including mailing lists for employees identifying sexually as \u201cyellow-scaled wingless dragonkin.\u201d But, she notes, the tech giant neglected to create or encourage such a venue for \u201ctraditional monogamy.\u201d  Dhillon says she\u2019s the advocate for a true underdog here. While Google welcomes the \u201cfurries and transgender,\u201d she says, conservative men are blacklisted. Among the loudest voices demanding social equality for conservative white males is, of course, President Trump.  Her approach to equality in Silicon Valley is an obvious deviation from the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements that have dominated social media in tandem with growing calls for gender equality for women in tech, Hollywood and elsewhere. In fact, while Dhillon sues Google for plotting to hire and promote women instead of men, the U.S. Department of Labor has filed suit against the company for quite the opposite: not hiring enough women.  Dhillon describes them as two different problems. Finding more women in the industry is a pipeline challenge. So long as American universities are churning out four male tech candidates for every one woman, she says, the supply issue can\u2019t be solved. To achieve balance in Silicon Valley, employers cannot stop hiring men: \u201cThat\u2019s not legal.\u201d  Harmeet Dhillon offered a Sikh prayer to open the second day of the 2016 Republican National Convention. Photographer: John Taggart/Bloomberg  Her ideals were born out of her tiny hometown in rural North Carolina, at her dinner table where her devout parents taught her about tort reform, taxation and what it meant to be an immigrant in Jimmy Carter\u2019s America. Coming from India\u2019s socialized democracy in the 1970s, when Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was on the cusp of temporarily suspending the nation\u2019s constitution, the idea of intense government intervention and regulation didn\u2019t resonate with the tax-averse, gun-holding Dhillon family. They fled India for the United Kingdom, then to America\u2019s promise of free-market capitalism, only to be miffed by the Carter administration\u2019s tax rates on capital gains. Discussions often centered on the U.S. gas shortage, flaws in socialism, foreign policy and family values.  Senator Jesse Helms, a leading North Carolina conservative at the time, was central to the family\u2019s political identity. As he spoke out against the Indian government\u2019s persecution of Sikhs, he won favor with the Punjabi diaspora in his own backyard. In the 1980s the Dhillon household became a political hub for Helms, who found wealthy donors among the state\u2019s hundreds of Sikh families.  While mulling her career path, Dhillon considered following her father into medicine. He never discouraged her, but he did describe surgery as physically taxing while asking her to contemplate her own physical strength and endurance. \u201cWomen have a lot of choices, and they frequently choose not to go into certain fields, which is totally legitimate,\u201d she says.  \u201cMy father was a turban-wearing man of faith when he decided to be a Republican in a Democratically controlled, Klan-heavy state in the South.\u201d  Instead, Dhillon studied classics at Dartmouth before going to law school at the University of Virginia. Her politics began to take shape as she served as editor-in-chief of the Dartmouth Review, a biweekly conservative newspaper, where in 1988 she published a satirical column likening the school\u2019s president to Adolf Hitler. She told the New York Times then that the column sought to shine light on \u201cliberal fascism,\u201d while demonstrating how the school had mistreated conservative students.  Now, as a Republican Party official in California, she applies her professional stature as a free-speech lawyer to advocate for conservatives. For example: She\u2019s representing the UC Berkeley students who are suing the school for snubbing Coulter.  Damore\u2019s class-action case fits that mold, arguing that he and other conservatives have been ostracized because their ideology was \u201cun-Googley\u201d at a place where there\u2019s an incentive for discriminating against whites, males and conservatives.  Dhillon was one of Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019s candidates to help run the Department of Justice\u2019s civil rights division, and she was reportedly considered for other political appointments in California and D.C. Had she gotten the civil rights job, Dhillon says, she would have prioritized First Amendment violations against conservatives, chased down human traffickers and fought for free speech at abortion clinics.  \u201cI\u2019m a supporter of the administration and the president, and that\u2019s my position. As a member of the RNC, if I couldn\u2019t support them on important issues, then I would resign my position,\u201d she says.  At a June 2016 Trump rally in San Jose, Dhillon witnessed city police ushering his supporters into the teeth of what would quickly boil over into a bloody confrontation with anti-Trump demonstrators. Stones and fists flew; red hats burned. The lawsuit, on behalf of 20 pro-Trump protesters, was Dhillon\u2019s reintroduction to national politics. The headlines opened doors for Dhillon, making her a fixture on Fox News as its only South Asian contributor. (Dhillon defeated San Jose\u2019s bid to dismiss the case, which is under appeal in federal court.)  Torn Trump signs lie on the ground behind a police skirmish line, during a protest near a rally held by then-presidential candidate Donald Trump in San Jose on June 2, 2016. Photographer: Josh Edelson/AFP via Getty Images  Weeks after her Trump protest suit was filed, she offered a Sikh prayer to open the second day of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, covering her head during the Punjabi invocation that sought holy protection and guidance for America to uphold the values of humility, truth and justice. Trump accepted the party\u2019s nomination the next day. In response, she says, she received death threats from fellow Sikhs and Indians.  Dhillon is soft-spoken about the ways in which she differs from her party and, particularly, the president. She does say America needs immigrants\u2014legal immigrants. An advocate for federalism, she\u2019d prefer to leave the federal government out of marriage and abortion rights. \u201cLife begins at conception,\u201d she says. \u201cAbortion should only be allowed in limited circumstances\u2014life of the mother and rape.\u201d She hates talking about that time she wrote now-Democratic Senator Kamala Harris a $250 check for a city campaign. \u201cIt was a nonpartisan race,\u201d she says, sounding like she has made this case before.  In 2012 she ran her latest political campaign, vying for a seat in the California State Senate. She was trounced in San Francisco\u2019s famed Castro neighborhood, but the 54,887 votes she won were the most ever for a Republican in the state\u2019s 11th District. She credits that small victory and her subsequent success to bending her California environment to her family, her party and her own ideals.  \u201cMy father was a turban-wearing man of faith when he decided to be a Republican in a Democratically controlled, Klan-heavy state in the South,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not Nikki Haley, and I\u2019m not Bobby Jindal. I\u2019ve never been looking to assume that assimilation mentality.\u201d  For more on discrimination in Silicon Valley, check out the Decrypted podcast:", "stock": "GOOGL", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-05", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-03-05/harmeet-dhillon-wants-silicon-valley-to-be-safe-for-conservatives"}, {"article": "Alphabet Inc. is changing a closely watched measure of Google\u2019s digital advertising business and adjusting how it accounts for some private stock holdings, a move that will make reported income more volatile.  The main difference is in how Google discloses the performance of its Network business, which runs ads on thousands of third-party websites. This will no longer be reported on a \"cost-per-click\" basis, or how many times the ads are clicked on. Instead, Google will report changes based on cost per impression -- the number of times the ads are viewed. In the fourth quarter of 2017, Google reported $5 billion in sales from network sites.  By using impressions, Google is providing a more-accurate reflection of its second-biggest business, after search, said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group. Most marketers already buy banner and video ads on websites based on impressions rather than cost-per-click. \"CPC is a meaningless number,\" he said.  The company also said that unrealized gains and losses on non-marketable equity securities, such as investments in private companies, will be reported as part of income. The tech giant has backed many large closely held companies including Uber Technologies Inc., Lyft Inc., and Magic Leap.  As a result, the company said it expects \"increased volatility\" on its income statement.  Finally, Alphabet said it will begin to report sales from Nest, its connected-home device division, under Google rather than its catch-all Other Bets segment. Nest moved to become part of Google\u2019s hardware business in February.  Alphabet described the changes, which kick in for the first quarter, in a statement on Monday.

Google Flights allows users to compare flight and hotel prices across providers and track prices over time.  Now, Google thinks it will be able to figure out if a flight is delayed before an airline announces the delay, in some cases. The company announced Wednesday that Google Flights will use historical data about flight delays and knowledge of current conditions to determine the likelihood of a flight being delayed. If it thinks there's at least an 80% chance of a delay, it will flag the relevant flight and include its predicted reason for the delay.

Google Flights will also add a function that highlights the restrictions that come with low-cost fares, such as the inability to check a bag for free or use the overhead bins.  The new features address one of the airline industry's biggest problems: transparency.  Airlines have drawn criticism over the years for making flights seem less expensive than they are by hiding added costs like baggage fees and failing to communicate clearly about delays. While airlines are required to include taxes and fees in their listed ticket prices, the US Department of Transportation announced in December 2017 that it would not force airlines to reveal the prices for \"optional services\" like checked or carry-on baggage at the time of purchase.

To be the first to know, please click here.  Google unveiled a slew of new features for its ecosystem of Google Assistant voice apps, called \"Actions,\" the company announced last week.  Google Assistant actions are similar to Amazon Alexa skills.  The new features \u2014 Custom Device Actions, push notifications, and support for media playback \u2014 could incentivize more developers to create actions for Google Assistantand drive consumer engagement, ultimately making Google Assistant a stronger competitor in the voice assistant landscape. That's because the more voice apps out there, the more useful \u2014 and appealing \u2014 the voice platform is for consumers.  Here are some of the new features for actions that Google is hoping will win over more voice developers:  Custom Device Actions to enable developers to implement native functionality that's specific to their devices. Currently, developers are limited to universal commands that Google implemented. But with Custom Device Actions, developers have the flexibility to extend Google Assistant to fully support their devices by adding their own custom actions. For example, a manufacturer of a smart dishwasher could add a command for an action that's not universal across other dishwashers, like \"start a hypercycle.\"  Currently, developers are limited to universal commands that Google implemented.

A new push notification API enables apps to send out alerts to users about the latest content available. Google is likely relying on notifications to bolster user retention and engagement, as they have been successful for smartphone apps. For example, push-enabled app users logged 53% more monthly sessions in mobile apps compared with users who hadn't engaged with a push message, according to Localytics.

For example, push-enabled app users logged 53% more monthly sessions in mobile apps compared with users who hadn't engaged with a push message, according to Localytics. Support for media playback and improved content carousels. Actions will now support media playback \u2014 such as meditation sessions, relaxing sounds, and clips from TV shows \u2014 on speakers and Android phones. Additionally, actions that are highly visual-based, such as those on smart speakers with display screens, can include a browse carousel that enables users to visually browse content (see below).  The new features will be key in bolstering user engagement and retention for Google Actions, which are two sore spots for voice app developers. One of the main issues with voice assistants is discoverability of voice apps \u2014 only 48% of smart speaker owners have used a third-party voice app, according to Voicebot.ai. And once they find a voice app, there's only a 6% chance that the user will continue using that voice app within two weeks, according to a September 2017 report from VoiceLabs. The new features could help to reduce the friction associated with voice app discovery and, in turn, drive engagement and retention.  Business Insider Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has written a detailed report on voice apps that explores the two major viable voice app stores. It identifies the three big issues voice apps are facing \u2014 discoverability, monetization, and retention \u2014 and presents possible short-term solutions ahead of industry-wide fixes.  Here are some of the key takeaways from the report:  The market for smart speakers and voice platforms is expanding rapidly. The installed base of smart speakers and the volume of voice apps that can be accessed on them each saw significant gains in 2017. But the new format and the emerging voice ecosystems that are making their way into smart speaker-equipped homes is so far failing to align with consumer needs.

Google is aiming to make its Google Assistant voice platform more useful by enabling multi-step voice commands and more tightly integrating the assistant with smartphones and carriers, according to The Verge.  The forthcoming updates are aimed at giving developers, phone vendors, and wireless carriers the tools to create a more interactive user experience, reach more users, and create a more seamless voice assistant experience. These updates are expected to roll out in the coming weeks and throughout the year.  Here are some of the new tools and expanded features that Google is hoping will win over more consumers and voice developers:  Routine commands on the Google Home smart speaker. Smart home routines enable users to manage their connected devices with just a single voice command to Google Assistant. Saying \"Good morning\" to Google Assistant can simultaneously turn on the lights, increase the thermostat temperature, and begin outlining the user's day via Google Calendar, for example. The announcement comes on the heels of a similar offering from Amazon.  Google Assistant.

This multilingual feature will initially only be available in English, French, and German, but is expected to expand to more languages over time. Deeper Assistant integration with phones and carriers. Google is working with smartphone vendors, starting with Xiaomi, LG, and Sony, to integrate Google Assistant with the specific hardware and software of smartphones. Users will be able to ask Google Assistant to launch a specific camera feature, issuing commands like, \"Hey Google, launch my camera's augmented reality mode,\" for example. Google is also working with wireless carriers, the first being Sprint, Vodafone, Telus, and Koodo, to integrate their services with Assistant. This could allow users to ask Google Assistant to check how much data is left on their monthly allotment, or even add more data to their plan.  The latest announcements could be key in helping Google bolster its voice assistant platform and spur adoption of the technology. A major challenge facing the overall voice assistant market is that most consumers rely on them to conduct simple tasks, like getting weather updates or setting timers, while complex and lengthy interactions lag. By creating new experiences that expand Google Assistant's ability to complete more complex tasks, the usefulness of the platform will increase, and engagement can grow as a result. As voice assistants become more intelligent, and developers create better and more useful ways to integrate them with consumers' lives, voice will cement itself as the primary way consumers interact with their devices.  Business Insider Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has written a detailed report on voice apps that explores the two major viable voice app stores. It identifies the three big issues voice apps are facing \u2014 discoverability, monetization, and retention \u2014 and presents possible short-term solutions ahead of industry-wide fixes.  Here are some of the key takeaways from the report:  The market for smart speakers and voice platforms is expanding rapidly. The installed base of smart speakers and the volume of voice apps that can be accessed on them each saw significant gains in 2017. But the new format and the emerging voice ecosystems that are making their way into smart speaker-equipped homes is so far failing to align with consumer needs.

The number given is a \"perfect number.\"  Google has a history of making mathematical references.  In its Q4 earnings report on Thursday, Google's parent company Alphabet announced plans to buy back some of its stock \u2014 $8,589,869,056 of stock to be exact.  There's a likely reason Google chose that specific value for their planned buyback: It's what mathematicians call a \"perfect number.\"  Perfect numbers are whole numbers with a fun property \u2014 they are the sum of all their proper divisors, or the whole numbers that evenly divide into the original number, except itself. The smallest perfect number is 6: 6 is divisible by 1, 2, 3, and itself. But then take those first three divisors and add them up, and you get 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.  8,589,869,056 is such a number. It has a few too many divisors to write out here \u2014 33 proper divisors in total \u2014 but the sum of its proper divisors does in fact come back up to itself.  In addition to their defining curious property, perfect numbers are relatively rare. They are closely connected to a certain class of prime numbers called Mersenne primes, or prime numbers that are one less than 2 raised to some prime number. Each even perfect number has a corresponding Mersenne prime.  Mersenne primes are interesting because it's relatively computationally easy to check whether a candidate Mersenne prime is in fact prime. Because of that, most of the largest prime numbers yet discovered are Mersenne primes, including the largest currently known prime number, 2 77,232,917 - 1.  Only 50 Mersenne primes have been found so far, which means because of their correspondence, only 50 perfect numbers are known so far. That makes Google's buyback choice quite a special number.  Google has a history of making mathematical references. In 2011, the company bid a multiple of pi in an auction for Nortel Networks' tech patents. Shortly after renaming itself Alphabet in 2015, the company announced a buyback in the amount of $5,099,019,513.59, which happens to be the square root of 26 x 10 18\u2014 26, of course, being the number of letters in the alphabet.

This little city was designed to show off all the different types of things the Google Assistant can do. Alex Wong/Getty Images  Google was aggressively pushing its Assistant at CES 2018, with a marketing blitz and a party with a performance by John Legend.  Google announced a bunch of new, key partnerships with companies including LG, Sony, and Lenovo to integrate with the Google Assistant.  However, Amazon's Alexa, and its line of Echo smart speakers, still dominate the market, with no signs of slowing down.  At last week's Consumer Electronics Show, the Google Assistant was inescapable.  There was a \"Hey Google\" ad on the side of the Las Vegas monorail, a reference to the magic words for invoking voice commands with the Google Assistant. The search giant also had a massive booth with a slide, which infamously got flooded out during an unseasonably intense storm on the first day of the show.  Indoors, many, if not most, of the internet-connected appliance vendors at the show boasted \"Works with Google Assistant\" emblems on their booth, or some variation. And then there was Google's CES party where John Legend performed for a very exclusive audience.  Google had some big news at the show, too: It was partnering up with companies including Lenovo, LG, and Sony to launch a line of Google Assistant-powered \"smart displays,\" which are basically just Google Home speakers with a screen. Plus, companies like Bose and LG are building Assistant into their headphones and TVs, respectively.  This was all clearly Google's way of striking back at Amazon Alexa, the market leader in this new category of voice-command devices.  Amazon was far and away the winner of last year's CES, with Alexa the star of many show-floor demonstrations. Google was at last year's CES, too, promoting its Google Home speakers. But all anybody wanted to talk about was Alexa.  At the 2018 show, Google Assistant grabbed the spotlight.  \"It is too early to measure the impact of Google's presence at CES, but they certainly made an impression,\" says Gartner Research Director Werner Goertz, who was at the show.  People lined up for hours at CES 2018 to try out this Google Assistant-powered vending machine, which dispensed prizes just for trying out the technology. Matt Weinberger/Business Insider  Indeed, Google has made great strides in catching up with Alexa in a very short time. The first Amazon Echo, which introduced Alexa, dropped in 2014. Google Home was released in late 2016, and within a year, had established itself as the most meaningful opponent to Alexa. I, personally, prefer Google Assistant to Amazon Alexa in my everyday life.  Google's \"smart displays\" are a direct answer to the Amazon Echo Show and Echo Spot, the first-ever Alexa devices with screens. And all of those new partner product integrations make the Google Assistant way more competitive with Alexa, which used its head start to establish itself as a dominant standard in the smart home.  This is all fine, as far as it goes. But the problem for Google as it rushes to play catch-up: Amazon hasn't stood still.  Amazon Echo is also getting better  First and foremost are the numbers; Amazon hints that Alexa products are outselling Google's. While Google says that it sold about 7 million Google Home speakers over the holiday season, Amazon said that it sold \"tens of millions\" of Alexa products over the same period. Without exact figures, it's hard to get a direct comparison, but the message is clear, and Google is lagging.  A big reason for that success is that Amazon keeps iterating and releasing new products. Just last year, Amazon released an all-new Echo, the Echo Plus home hub, the fashion camera Echo Look, the Echo Show, the Echo Spot, and even Echo Buttons, simple Bluetooth game controllers for the Echo.  Google, for comparison, released two new Home speakers, the $50 Mini and the $400 Max. And while Google claims the former is selling quite well, the latter is definitely more of a niche product for higher-end audiophiles (or wannabe DJs).  Those new Home products are good in their own right, but they're not as interesting as Amazon's Echo experiments. For instance, Amazon is playing around with new ways to interact with Alexa \u2014 the Echo Look camera helps you create a fashion look book for yourself; the Echo Plus streamlines the complicated process of adding smart home gear. Meanwhile, the Google Home Mini and Max are just variations on the same basic concept for a smart speaker that Amazon pioneered with the original Echo back in 2014.  Lots of companies were proudly promoting their Google Assistant integrations at CES 2018. Matt Weinberger/Business Insider  On the software side, both companies are getting better and at a fast rate. This is actually where Google shines, as its investments in artificial intelligence means that Google Home is getting better by the day at playing music, mapping a route, or even letting you know when a flight is cheap.  Gartner's Goertz lauds the progress Google has made with building out the Google Assistant ecosystem, but says there's still a ways to go, partnership-wise, to really catch up with Alexa.  Meanwhile, Amazon is making serious investments in turning Alexa into a platform. This year, as we previously reported, Amazon has big plans to start paying developers of the 30,000 Alexa \"skills,\" or apps, which could turn Alexa into an economy and ecosystem all on its own.  Google hasn't quite gotten to that point with Assistant yet, and so developers could well feel like there's a bigger incentive to stick with Alexa.  In short, Google is making serious inroads and has become the biggest roadblock to Amazon just completely running away with this young market. But Amazon is proving once again that it can move faster than its rivals. Google will have to pick up the pace if it wants to go beyond dominating CES, and into dominating the market.", "stock": "GOOGL", "label": 1, "date": "2018-01-21", "source": "business-insider", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/google-assistant-versus-amazon-alexa-2018-1"}, {"article": "Google Hangouts Chat on the PC web browser. Google  Google is finally releasing Hangouts Chat, its messaging app for business.  It's going right up against Microsoft Teams, Cisco Spark, and the $5 billion Silicon Valley startup Slack.  This is yet another attempt by Google to create a successful messaging platform. However, competition in this space is steep.  On Wednesday, Google is expected to make Hangouts Chat, its long-promised workplace chatroom tool for businesses, available to enterprise users of its G Suite productivity service. Google shared the news in a blog entry.  Hangouts Chat is available from the web browser, or from iOS and Android apps.  The service was first announced almost exactly a year ago, right alongside Hangouts Meet, a videoconferencing tool. Hangouts Meet has been available to the public for months, but Chat has so far only been available to a relative few G Suite customers in the Early Adopter Program.  Now, Hangouts Chat will go right up against some of tech's biggest guns. $5 billion startup Slack provides what many consider the gold standard in team communication software, while the similar Microsoft Teams is a key part of the Office 365 cloud productivity suite for businesses.

Like Slack and Microsoft Teams, Hangouts Chat supports chatbots. It comes with a total of 25 bots built in, including bots to tell you when a Google Drive file is updated, or when you have a Google Calendar appointment. You can also install bots that integrate with outside services, like Atlassian Jira or Salesforce CRM.

A malfunction in Google's devices could cause WiFi routers to become overwhelmed and temporarily shut down.  TP-Link has confirmed the issue, and WiFi routers from other companies are also reportedly affected.  Several of Google's hardware devices, including the popular Chromecast video streaming dongle and the new top-of-the-line smart speaker, appear to suffer from a glitch that can temporarily freeze a consumer's home wireless network.  Numerous owners of the devices have recently reported experiencing WiFi network issues, and several tech blogs say Google is to blame.  On Tuesday, a maker of networking products by the name of TP-Link wrote in a blog post that its routers have been affected by Google devices that use the Google \"casting\" feature. The company said a glitch caused a WiFi network to become temporarily unresponsive or disconnect from other devices that were connected to the network.  WiFi routers from other companies, including Linksys, Asus, Netgear, and Synology are also reportedly affected.  It's not clear whether the problem stems from a flaw in Google's hardware, or whether it's the result of a broader software issue.  But the news represents the latest blow to Google's efforts to enter the hardware market, where it has limited experience and competes against longtime gadget makers like Samsung and Apple. In October, Google was forced to disable a button on the Home Mini smart speaker before the product even shipped due to a privacy problem.  Google \"casting\" devices come out of sleep mode and cause disruptions  According to TP-Link's blog post on the WiFi issue, the problems began in October 2017.  Google The company explained that under normal circumstances, Google's casting devices are designed to wake from a sleep state every so often to communicate with a WiFi router with small bits of data, called \"packets.\"  The problem is that some of Google's devices were malfunctioning and wouldn't rise out sleep mode for longer periods of time. When they did awake from their slumber, they flooded a WiFi router with huge amounts of data packets at a \"very high speed,\" which would overwhelm certain routers and cause the disruptions. The amount of data that would be sent to a WiFi router depended on how long a Google casting device was in sleep mode.  TP-Link has issued firmware updates for its affected WiFi routers, and a statement from Google to Engadget said \"We're aware that a small number of users are having issues and our team is working quickly to share a solution.\"  One of the ways to prevent WiFi network issues is to disable the casting feature in your Google casting devices. Of course, if the product is a Chromecast, that means you're effectively making the product useless.  Business Insider has contacted Google for comment, as well as a clarification of which devices can become affected, but the company hasn't yet replied.  There are several devices that support Google's casting feature, like smartphones, tablets, media streamers, and smart TVs.

You simply start your recording, go through your usual steps and when you\u2019re done, all it takes to repeat all those steps is to run the macro again. Never again will you have to spend minutes on reformatting that same spreadsheet over and over again. Instead, you\u2019ll have more time to play with your puppy (or get more work done, if you\u2019re so inclined).  In the backend, Sheets actually converts your macro into Apps Script code, which also means that if you want to dive a bit deeper or make a small change, you can edit that script.  In addition to macro support, this Sheets update also brings a couple of other features, including the ability to add page breaks (for when you print a spreadsheet), custom paper sizes, new options for row and column grouping and the option to turn a cell into a checkbox. You can now also group data in pivot tables by time frame (think week, month, year).", "stock": "GOOGL", "label": 1, "date": "2018-04-11", "source": "techcrunch", "url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/04/11/google-sheets-gets-macros/"}, {"article": "A couple of things to know about Google Clips: First, it is absolutely, unequivocally not a life-logging camera. Sure, it may be called Clips and it does, in fact, have a clip on the back. But do not clip it to your clothing. Google was very insistent about this bit.  Second, it is not an action camera. There are plenty available, if you\u2019re in the market. Google Clips is not that. Don\u2019t attach it to your skydiving helmet or motorcycle handlebars. Third, Clips is unequivocally not a security camera. Again, there are plenty of those. Here\u2019s one you can buy for $20.  So then what, precisely, is Clips? A \u201csmart camera,\u201d according to Google. It\u2019s a new category, of sorts. One that really couldn\u2019t have existed in this form without the current on-board technology. The device is actually a deceptively sophisticated collection of tech wrapped up in an adorable little package that looks like an Instagram icon that a fairy godmother turned into a real boy.  It\u2019s not exactly the \u201cset it and forget it\u201d device that we thought we were getting when the company first announced it way back when at its Pixel 2 event. As advertised, Clips is intended to capture little moments it might otherwise be tough to photograph. The system uses a combination of AI and ML to identify familiar people and animals and determine the moments worth capturing.  All of that happens through a robust combination of AI and ML, all processed directly on the device itself \u2014 rather than sending it off to a server for processing. This helps cut down on the processing time and maintains some privacy, with nothing you shoot leaving the camera until you choose to transfer it.  It\u2019s an interesting concept \u2014 and one that could certainly appeal to parents looking to capture those little moments without having to keep a smartphone or camera screen at the ready all the time. But is it $249 worth of interesting?  Fixed lens  A lot of thought clearly went into making Clips as simple as possible to operate. The result is an extremely minimalist object, roughly the size of a silver dollar. On the front is a large, fixed lens. Twisting it turns the camera on an off, while a trio of white lights let you know that it\u2019s on. Google says it purposely designed the Clips to be immediately recognizable as a camera, so people are aware that they\u2019re being recorded if they\u2019ve never seen one before. And, indeed, it looks like a real-world shorthand for the basic idea of a camera.  Below the lens is a single button \u2014 the only one on the device itself. This is the shutter. Something the company apparently only added after getting feedback from users. Sure, the system is built around the notion of using machine learning to take the perfect photos and videos, but sometimes you want to override that and not leave it up to chance.  On the bottom is a USB-C port for charging the battery and a small hole used to manually reset the system. The back of the device, meanwhile, is empty, save for a Google \u201cG\u201d logo. There\u2019s no built-in viewfinder, for several reasons, including, but not limited to: price, battery life and the desire to simplify the product as much as possible.  That means you\u2019ll have to sort of eyeball the ideal spot to place the camera to get the right shot. Given the fact that it\u2019s got a fixed focal length, there isn\u2019t a ton of wiggle room there. Google recommends placing it around three to eight feet from your subject. You also can tap into Live Preview on the accompanying app to get a better idea of what the camera is seeing. The feature also will let you know whether the camera is on a flat surface for better shots. Of course, staring at that sort of defeats the whole \u201cnot having to keep a smartphone or camera screen at the ready all the time\u201d thing.  A river runs through it  The Clips app is similarly simple, to a fault. By default, everything is captured in a seven-second video called\u2026 wait for it\u2026 a Clip. If you\u2019ve ever used Vine, Apple Live Photos or Google Motion Photos, you know the deal here. In fact, the videos shot on device can be saved as either of the latter two and, even more handily, an animated GIF.  Everything captured by the device is served up in a river. All of the shots appear as static images, until you scroll over them, at which point you can view the full seven seconds of action.  Tap on a Clip to edit it either as a still image or motion video. The device actually saves every Clip as a series of stills. Using the Photo option, you can scroll through to grab the perfect frame and save that as a JPEG. The video editing option, meanwhile, has built-in scrubbers that let you edit the length of the Clip.  Machine learning  Once you start capturing shots, you\u2019ll notice that some sport a sparkle icon in the upper-right corner. That shows up on \u201cSuggested Clips\u201d \u2014 when the system identifies the face of a familiar person or pet. If you want to utilize the functionality, you can connect your device to your Google Photos account and the system will cull facial information from there.  You also can just put the camera to use and it will pick up faces pretty quickly. That aspect did seem to be pretty hit or miss in our testing. There wasn\u2019t really much consistency with regard to which Clips of a particular subject the system identified as \u201csuggested.\u201d So far, it\u2019s been trained to capture humans, dogs and cats.  I also can confirm that it does a pretty decent job on rabbits. The Google team wasn\u2019t really sure how it would fare on that front, given some of the complexities of the artificial intelligence on board. For example, the system is trained to identify certain aspects, like standing on four legs, whereas rabbits tend to sit on their hind legs. But Google\u2019s AI managed to prevail here, so kudos to them, and congrats to the dozen or so people looking to pick up a Clips to grab photos of their bunny.  One perfect shot  Clips mostly does a good job capturing key moments. It\u2019s not perfect, of course. And really, it requires a bit of good-old-fashioned human curation. That\u2019s where you come in. Odds are you\u2019re only going to end up sharing a fraction of the shots the camera ends up capturing.  The device has 16GB of storage on board, so it\u2019s going to take you a while to fill the thing up with all of those 1080p videos \u2014 meaning it will be a while before you have to worry about going through and deleting things. The battery, meanwhile, should last around three hours on a charge. It also will go into sleep mode if it gets bored and doesn\u2019t spot any action.  The videos are captured in 1080p and the stills are roughly what you\u2019d expect from a standard smartphone camera. And as with many smartphones, Clips struggles in low-light situations. Images come back grainy and motion is blurry. The device will auto-adjust color settings like the default on a handset. You can\u2019t futz with those levels in the camera app \u2014 and honestly that level of control probably runs counter to the sort of plug and play functionality Google\u2019s shooting for here. Though extra control is never a bad thing.  Money clips  The first time I tested a smart security camera in my home, I ended up disabling the notifications. I was just getting way too many false positives. Every time my rabbit would move at home, the app would alert me, even if I was on the other side of the world. It was really annoying \u2014 but thankfully, the company added AI functionality that was able to distinguish animals and other movement from people.  Clips sort of works on the opposite principle, operating on the idea that the right combination of image smarts can scientifically capture the perfect moment in time. It\u2019s a new piece of technology designed to free you from being constantly tethered to another piece of technology. It\u2019s an odd proposition, and ultimately one that will likely be searching to find its audience for a generation or two.  Sure, there\u2019s appeal for parents looking to capture as many perfect moments with their kids before they get too old. And certainly plenty of pet owners need another excuse to fill their social media feeds full of adorable action shots. Clips certainly delivers as a GIF delivery service, but $249 is a steep price to pay for such novelty in an era when we\u2019ve all got a camera within arm\u2019s reach 24 hours a day.", "stock": "GOOGL", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-27", "source": "techcrunch", "url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/02/27/google-clips-review/"}, {"article": "Alongside news of Google Assistant\u2019s forthcoming multilingual support and the addition of more languages this year, Google also announced this morning its smart assistant would soon be gaining two new features: Routines and location-based reminders.  Google has been promising Routines were in the works for some time.  The feature, which lets Google Assistant users string together multiple commands, was first announced back in October 2017. With Routines, you can create personalized commands and responses \u2013 for example, saying \u201cOK Google, I\u2019m home,\u201d could turn on the lights, adjust the thermostat, and play some music.  It\u2019s a feature that rival Alexa announced in September 2017, and launched the following month. Google is playing catch up here, but it\u2019s doing it quickly.  This isn\u2019t the only way that Google Assistant can multitask, however. Before, you could say two commands in one sentence \u2013 like \u201cturn on the TV and what\u2019s the weather?\u201d, and the smart assistant could perform both actions.  However, Routines will support tying together more than two commands, and will associate them with a trigger phrase.  According to Google, Routines will first launch in the U.S. in the weeks ahead, and will allow users to personalize six routines that help with morning commutes to and from work, and their evening at home.  In addition to Routines, location-based reminders is another new feature set to roll out in the near future.  This option is already available in Google Assistant on smartphones, but it will now be integrated into Google Home devices, as well.  Of course, the Google Home smart speaker stays in one location itself \u2013 but it can be used to create the location-based reminders you want to be alerted about later on your phone.  For example, you could tell your Google Home device to remind you to buy milk when you\u2019re at the grocery store.  Google didn\u2019t give an exact launch date for either feature as it\u2019s a staged rollout, but says they\u2019ll start arriving next week.", "stock": "GOOGL", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-23", "source": "techcrunch", "url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/02/23/google-assistant-is-adding-routines-and-location-based-reminders/"}, {"article": "Google today announced a small but important update for its Google Home devices: you will now be able to control all of your Bluetooth speakers and stream music to them right from your Google Home devices.  Until now, you could only use your Google Home\u2019s Bluetooth capabilities to stream music to them (from your phone, for example). But now, you\u2019ll be able to use your Google Home Mini which doesn\u2019t exactly have the most impressive built-in speakers, to control the Bluetooth-enabled bookshelf speakers you have in your living room.  Indeed, as Google notes in today\u2019s announcement, the company decided to add this feature because its Google Home Mini users requested it.

On Android, however, the Android Pay app stuck with its existing brand. That\u2019s changing today, though, with the launch of Google Pay for Android. With this, Google is rolling out an update to Android Pay and introducing some new functionality that the company hopes will make its payment service ubiquitous \u2014 both in stores and on the internet.  In addition, Google is also launching a redesign of the Google Wallet app for sending and requesting money, and it\u2019s now called Google Pay Send. Users in the U.S. and U.K., though, will also soon be able to use the Google Pay app for sending and requesting money. New users can download the Google Pay app today and existing Android Pay users will get updated over the course of the next few days.  At first glance, the new Google Pay app is basically a redesign of Android Pay, with a look and feel that adheres closer to Google\u2019s own Material Design guidelines than the original. In terms of functionality, there isn\u2019t all that much here that\u2019s new. One notable change, though, is that the Google Pay home screen now shows you relevant stores around you where you can pay with Google Pay. That list is personalized, based on previous stores where you used the service, as well as your location. In addition, the home screen shows you all of your recent purchases and you can still add all of your loyalty cards to the app.  As Google\u2019s VP of Product Management for Payments, Pali Bhat, told me, the team really wanted to make it extremely easy to get started with Google Pay and use the service to pay for goods online and in the real world \u2014 and to do so with as little friction as possible. That means that users who bank with Bank of America in the U.S. or a Google partner like Mbank in Poland can set up Google Pay right from their bank\u2019s app without having to install Google Pay. Once that\u2019s set up, you can simply pay with Google Pay online and out in the real world.  Similarly, if an online app or website wants to support this, developers can call a Google API to see if a given user has Google Pay enabled and can then accept payments through Google Pay (which still get routed through the developers\u2019 regular payment processors like Stripe or Braintree).  \u201cWe give developers a very simple API to implement Google Pay,\u201d Bhat noted. \u201cThe API is simple because we are not processing that payment.

The feature is available within the Google Photos iOS application, where it can do things like identify objects, buildings, and landmarks, and tell you more information about them, including helpful details like their phone number, address, or open hours. It can also identify things like books, paintings in museums, plants, and animals. In the case of some objects, it can also take actions.  For example, you can add an event to your calendar from a photo of a flyer or event billboard, or you can snap a photo of a business card to store the person\u2019s phone number or address to your Contacts. (Turning photos into Contacts is something that Microsoft just added to its Pix app, too, with the option of also locating the person on LinkedIn.)  Google Lens was first announced last year at Google\u2019s I/O developer conference, and is made possible by the recent advancements in machine learning and image recognition technologies. The eventual goal is to allow smartphone cameras to understand what it is they\u2019re seeing across any type of photo, then helping you take action on that information, if need be \u2013 whether that\u2019s calling a business, saving contact information, or just learning about the world on the other side of the camera.  During the demo at I/O, Google showed off how Google Lens could do other things, too. It could be used to help you configure your Wi-Fi, for instance. That is, if you took a photo of the sticker on your router, it could help you to paste that information in your Wi-Fi settings to get you connected. The company also demonstrated a translation feature that converted signs in a foreign language to English.  It doesn\u2019t seem we\u2019re quite there yet with all these promised features, but they could become possible in the future as Google Lens matures.  According to a tweet from the Google Photos\u2019 Twitter account, Google Lens in Google Photos on iOS began rolling out on Thursday to those who have the latest version (3.15) of the app installed.

In an effort to more deeply integrate Google\u2019s search engine on iOS devices, the company announced today that its Search app for iOS has added an iMessage extension, allowing iPhone and iPad users to search the web, then quickly add those search results to their iMessage conversations.  The extension itself is clearly inspired by Google\u2019s experiments with Gboard, Google\u2019s own third-party keyboard app for iOS devices, and comes at a time when the popularity of alternative iOS keyboards seems to be declining. Nuance, for example, just shut down its Swype keyboard app; and Swiftkey had exited to Microsoft a couple of years ago.  With Google\u2019s iMessage extension, users can type a query in the search box, or tap a button below for a specific type of search \u2013 like Weather, Food, Nearby (venues/businesses), Trending (news), or Videos \u2013 all very similar to Gboard.    Google highlights restaurant search in particular in its announcement, as deciding where to eat is a common theme in iMessage chats. Tapping \u201cNearby\u201d can help quickly pull up business listings or points of interest near your current location, which is also useful when communicating about a particular location.  Each search result includes a \u201cShare\u201d button that, when tapped, adds the item directly into an iMessage conversation as card. When the recipient taps on the card, they\u2019ll go to the Google search result.  In addition, Google\u2019s iMessage app offers a GIF search engine. This is available by tapping on the \u201cGIF\u201d button to the right of the search box, which will immediately load a selection of GIFs from sites like Giphy and Tenor, which you can then filter further by performing a search.  GIF search is a popular feature in Gboard, following that app\u2019s update last year.  Making Gboard\u2019s features available via an iMessage extension makes sense because not everyone wants to swap out their default keyboard on their iOS device.  It also give Google another way to reach users on iOS, even when they\u2019re not in Google\u2019s app itself. This is important because Google\u2019s traffic acquisition costs have been climbing due to the shift to mobile devices, where apps and assistants like Siri serve up many of the answers users once turned to Google for, when on desktop. It also has to pay Apple billions to be the default search engine on iOS.  The app, like other iMessage extensions, is available by tapping the iMessage apps drawer in iMessage, then scrolling over to the Google app icon. (If you have a lot of iMessage apps already installed, it may be tucked away under \u201cMore.\u201d)  The iMessage extension is one of three new features Google announced today for iOS users. However, it has actually been available in the Google app since February 7, 2018, according to Sensor Tower, indicating more of a soft launch.  Google also added two other features that integrate its search engine into iOS in new ways. One is a new share sheet option \u2013 now, when you share a webpage from Safari with Google, it will also show you suggestions for related content. A similar feature launched last year in the Google Search app, but is annoying as it pops up over the content when you reach the bottom of the page. With the new Share with Google functionality, it makes a bit more sense as the idea is that you could move from a webpage in Safari directly into a set of Google search results on the topic/  Also new is support for drag and drop on iPad. You can use the feature to move text, images, and links to and from the Google app, share articles from Google into iMessage, or save them into Notes for later reading.

To balance those competing preferences, you need a great vertical-search engine, which was something Adam and Shivaun had thought a lot about.  Photo  Soon the Raffs began daydreaming about turning their idea into a moneymaker. They didn\u2019t have the funds to compete with huge dating sites like Match.com, so they applied for a couple of patents and began brainstorming. They believed that their vertical-search technology was good \u2014 better, in fact, than almost anything they had seen online. Best of all, it was built to work well on almost any kind of data set. With just a bit of tinkering, it could search for cheap airline tickets, or great apartments, or high-paying jobs. It could handle questions with hard-to-compare variables, like what\u2019s the cheapest flight between London and Las Vegas if I\u2019m trying to choose between business class or leaving after 3 p.m.?  As far as they could tell, their search technology performed better on such problems than Google did, which Adam discovered when he tried to buy an iPod online. \u201cI spent half an hour searching Google for the lowest price, and it drove me completely mad,\u201d he told me. It was impossible for him to figure out which sites were selling iPods and which were selling accessories, like headphones or charging cords. Or Google would show Adam one price, but then the actual price was completely different. Or there was an extra charge for shipping. It seemed to Adam his technology would do a much better job.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Google executives, had they known of Adam\u2019s frustrations, probably wouldn\u2019t have been surprised. For years, Google had been trying to build a tool for comparing online prices. \u201cThe idea was you should be able to input any item, and we\u2019d show you the best place to buy it,\u201d says Brian Larson, a technical lead for what was then named Froogle and today is called Google Shopping. Larson\u2019s team was small \u2014 just himself and one other programmer at first, and roughly a dozen people at its height \u2014 and Larson would regularly test how Froogle compared with other online price-comparison services. \u201cSometimes we were neck and neck; sometimes, not so much,\u201d Larson said. \u201cWe had a hundred million product listings, which was better than competitors.\u201d But they were often outperformed by sites like PriceGrabber.com, which had many more employees devoted to price comparisons.  Froogle\u2019s limitations tended to pop up particularly when users included too many search parameters. For a while, Larson had a specific test search that Froogle kept failing, something like \u201cwhite running shoes and cheap and free shipping.\u201d Inevitably, the first result would be a Christmas elf wearing running shoes that some guy was selling online. No matter how Google\u2019s engineers fiddled with their coding, they couldn\u2019t stop the elf from appearing as the top link. Eventually, a manager bought the elf so it wouldn\u2019t appear in the search results anymore. \u201cWe made elf T-shirts,\u201d Larson told me. \u201cIt became our mascot.\u201d  Adam and Shivaun\u2019s technology was good enough to tell the difference between an elf wearing running shoes and an actual pair of running shoes. It was good enough, in fact, to figure out which websites charged hidden shipping fees and which offered truly good deals. So the Raffs quit their jobs, hired a few programmers, spent months perfecting their technology and, in early 2006, unveiled Foundem.com, a vertical-search engine for finding cheap online prices, to a small group of friends and associates. Each time someone used Foundem to buy something, the Raffs would receive a small payment from the website making the sale. Adam and Shivaun weren\u2019t sure their company would succeed \u2014 there were already a couple of other big price-comparison search engines, like PriceGrabber, NexTag and, of course, Google itself \u2014 but they figured this was how the internet was supposed to work: Two people with a new idea can take on giants and, if their technology is good enough, grow into colossi themselves.  The Raffs knew they would have to rely on Google to find customers. For one thing, as evidenced by the name Foundem, they weren\u2019t marketing geniuses. (\u201cIt\u2019s like we found \u2019em for you, you know?\u201d Shivaun explained.) But early tests indicated that Foundem usually came up high in Google\u2019s search results whenever people submitted queries like \u201ccompare prices xr-1000 motorcycle helmets.\u201d Six months later, they opened Foundem to the world, and initial traffic was encouraging. \u201cSearch engines liked the site,\u201d Shivaun told me. \u201cThat\u2019s supposed to be the recipe for success.\u201d As long as their vertical-search technology was strong, the Raffs figured, Google would guide shoppers to their door.  Google has succeeded where Genghis Khan, communism and Esperanto all failed: It dominates the globe. Though estimates vary by region, the company now accounts for an estimated 87 percent of online searches worldwide. It processes trillions of queries each year, which works out to at least 5.5 billion a day, 63,000 a second. So odds are good that sometime in the last week, or last hour, or last 10 minutes, you\u2019ve used Google to answer a nagging question or to look up a minor fact, and barely paused to consider how near-magical it is that almost any bit of knowledge can be delivered to you faster than you can type the request. If you\u2019re old enough to remember the internet before 1998, when Google was founded, you\u2019ll recall what it was like when searching online involved AltaVista or Lycos and consistently delivered a healthy dose of spam or porn. (Pity the early web enthusiasts who innocently asked Jeeves about \u201camateurs\u201d or \u201csteel.\u201d)  In other words, it\u2019s very likely you love Google, or are at least fond of Google, or hardly think about Google, the same way you hardly think about water systems or traffic lights or any of the other things you rely on every day. Therefore you might have been surprised when headlines began appearing last year suggesting that Google and its fellow tech giants were threatening everything from our economy to democracy itself. Lawmakers have accused Google of creating an automated advertising system so vast and subtle that hardly anyone noticed when Russian saboteurs co-opted it in the last election. Critics say Facebook exploits our addictive impulses and silos us in ideological echo chambers. Amazon\u2019s reach is blamed for spurring a retail meltdown; Apple\u2019s economic impact is so profound it can cause market-wide gyrations. These controversies point to the growing anxiety that a small number of technology companies are now such powerful entities that they can destroy entire industries or social norms with just a few lines of computer code. Those four companies, plus Microsoft, make up America\u2019s largest sources of aggregated news, advertising, online shopping, digital entertainment and the tools of business and communication. They\u2019re also among the world\u2019s most valuable firms, with combined annual revenues of more than half a trillion dollars.  In a rare display of bipartisanship, lawmakers from both political parties have started questioning how these tech giants grew so powerful so fast. Regulators in Missouri, Utah, Washington, D.C., and elsewhere have called for greater scrutiny of Google and others, citing antitrust concerns; some critics have suggested that our courts and legislatures need to go after tech firms in the same way the trustbusters broke up oil and railroad monopolies a century ago. But others say that Google and its cohort are guilty only of delighting customers. If these tech leviathans ever fail to satisfy us, their defenders argue, capitalism will punish them the same way it once brought down Yahoo, AOL and Myspace.  At the core of this debate is a question that is more than a century old: When does a megacompany\u2019s behavior become so brazen that it violates the law? In the early 1900s, just after the Industrial Revolution, the federal government provided an answer by suing one of America\u2019s largest companies, Standard Oil, on the novel theory that big becomes bad when a giant uses its dominance not only to defeat its competitors but also to extinguish the possibility that competition might occur.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  In its technological innovation, Standard Oil was the Google of its day. The company\u2019s founder, John D. Rockefeller, had become the richest man in America by spending millions of dollars hiring scientists to transform how oil was refined and transported. And those innovations earned the public\u2019s admiration. In 1858, before Standard Oil was founded, lighting a home required whale oil, which cost up to $3 a gallon, putting illumination out of reach for all but the wealthiest of households. By 1885, after Standard Oil figured out how to refine kerosene, it cost just 8 cents a gallon to brighten the night. \u201cLet the good work go on,\u201d Rockefeller wrote to a partner. \u201cWe must ever remember we are refining oil for the poor man and he must have it cheap and good.\u201d  Standard Oil\u2019s technological discoveries gave the company huge advantages over its rivals, and Rockefeller exploited those advantages ruthlessly. He cut secret deals with railroads so that other firms had to pay more for transportation. He forced smaller refineries to choose between selling out to him or facing bankruptcy. \u201cRockefeller and his associates did not build the Standard Oil Co. in the boardrooms of Wall Street,\u201d wrote Ida Tarbell, a muckraking journalist of the day. \u201cThey fought their way to control by rebate and drawback, bribe and blackmail, espionage and price cutting, and perhaps more important, by ruthless, never slothful efficiency of organization.\u201d  In 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt ordered his Justice Department to sue Standard Oil for antitrust violations. But government lawyers faced a quandary: It wasn\u2019t illegal for Standard Oil to be a monopoly. It wasn\u2019t even illegal to compete mercilessly. So government prosecutors found a new argument: If a firm is more powerful than everyone else, they said, it can\u2019t simply act like everyone else. Instead, it has to live by a special set of rules, so that other companies get a fair shot. \u201cThe theory was that competition is good, and if a monopoly extinguishes competition, that\u2019s bad,\u201d says Herbert Hovenkamp, co-author of a seminal treatise on antitrust law. \u201cOnce you become a monopoly, you have to start acting differently, and if you don\u2019t, then what you\u2019ve been doing all along starts breaking the law.\u201d  The Supreme Court agreed and split Standard Oil into 34 firms. (Rockefeller received stock in all of them and became even wealthier.) In the decades following the Standard Oil breakup, antitrust enforcement generally abided by a core principle: When a company grows so powerful that it becomes a gatekeeper, and uses that might to undermine competitors, then the government should intervene. And in the last century, as courts have censured other monopolies, academics and jurists have noticed a pattern: Monopolies and technology often seem intertwined. When a company discovers a technological advantage \u2014 like the innovations of Rockefeller\u2019s scientists \u2014 it sometimes makes that firm so powerful that it becomes a monopoly almost without trying very hard. Many of the most important antitrust lawsuits in American history \u2014 against IBM, Alcoa, Kodak and others \u2014 were rooted in claims that one company had made technological discoveries that allowed it to outpace competitors.  For decades, there seemed to be a consensus among policymakers and business leaders (though not always among targeted companies) about how the antitrust laws should be enforced. But around the turn of this century, a number of tech companies emerged that caused some people to question whether the antitrust formula made sense anymore. Firms like Google and Facebook have become increasingly useful as they have grown bigger and bigger \u2014 a characteristic known as network effects. What\u2019s more, some have argued that the online world is so fast-moving that no antitrust lawsuit can keep pace. Nowadays even the biggest titan can be defeated by a tiny start-up, as long as the newcomer has better ideas or faster tech. Antitrust laws, digital executives said, aren\u2019t needed anymore.  Consider Microsoft. The government spent most of the 1990s suing Microsoft for antitrust violations, a prosecution that many now view as a complete waste of time and money. When Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, Bill Gates, signed a consent decree to resolve one of its monopoly investigations in 1994, he told a reporter that it was essentially pointless for the company\u2019s various divisions: \u201cNone of the people who run those divisions are going to change what they do or think.\u201d Even after a federal judge ordered Microsoft broken into separate companies in 2000, the punishment didn\u2019t take. Microsoft fought the ruling and won on appeal. The government then offered a settlement so feeble that nine states begged the court to reject the proposal. It was approved.  What eventually humbled Bill Gates and ended Microsoft\u2019s monopoly wasn\u2019t antitrust prosecutions, observers say, but a more nimble start-up named Google, a search engine designed by two Stanford Ph.D. dropouts that outperformed Microsoft\u2019s own forays into search (first MSN Search and now Bing). Then those two dropouts introduced a series of applications, like Google Docs and Google Sheets, that eventually began to compete with almost every aspect of Microsoft\u2019s businesses. And Google did all that not by relying on government prosecutors but by being smarter. You don\u2019t need antitrust in the digital marketplace, critics argue. \u201cWhen our products don\u2019t work or we make mistakes, it\u2019s easy for users to go elsewhere because our competition is only a click away,\u201d Google\u2019s co-founder, Larry Page, said in 2012. Translation: The government ought to stop worrying, because no online giant will ever survive any longer than it deserves to.  Once Foundem.com was available to everyone, the company\u2019s honeymoon lasted precisely two days. During its first 48 hours, the Raffs saw a rush of traffic from users typing product queries into Google and other search engines. But then, suddenly, the traffic stopped. Alarmed, Adam and Shivaun began running diagnostics. They quickly discovered that their site, which until then had been appearing near the top of search results, was now languishing on Google, mired 12 or 15 or 64 or 170 pages down. On other search engines, like MSN Search and Yahoo, Foundem still ranked high. But on Google, Foundem had effectively disappeared. And Google, of course, was where a vast majority of people searched online.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  The Raffs wondered if this could be some kind of technical error, so they began checking their coding and sending email to Google executives, begging them to fix whatever was causing Foundem to vanish. Figuring out whom to write, and how to contact them, was a challenge in itself. Although Google\u2019s parent company bills itself as a diversified firm with about 80,000 employees, almost 90 percent of the company\u2019s revenues derive from advertisements, like the ones that show up in search. As a result, there are few things more important to Google\u2019s executives than protecting the firm\u2019s search dominance, particularly among the most profitable kinds of queries, such as those of users looking to buy things online. In fact, at about the same time the Raffs were starting Foundem.com, Google executives were growing increasingly concerned about the threats that vertical-search engines posed to Google\u2019s business.  \u201cWhat is the real threat if we don\u2019t execute on verticals?\u201d one Google executive emailed his colleagues in 2005, according to internal documents later shared with the Federal Trade Commission. \u201cLoss of traffic from Google.com because folks search elsewhere for some queries,\u201d he wrote, in answer to his own question. \u201cIf one of our big competitors builds a constellation of high-quality verticals, we are hurt badly,\u201d the internal documents continued. Another executive put it more bluntly: \u201cGoogle\u2019s core business is monetizing commercial queries. If users go to competitors such as Amazon to do product queries, long-term revenue will suffer.\u201d  Google executives began holding battle-plan meetings for the vertical war. Shortly after Foundem.com went online, one executive issued an order: Henceforth, Google\u2019s own price-comparison results should appear at the top of many search pages, as quickly as possible, even if that meant disregarding the natural results of the company\u2019s search algorithm. \u201cLong term, I think we need to commit to a more aggressive path,\u201d a high-ranking Google employee wrote to colleagues. Eventually, a mandate came from the chief executive: \u201cLarry thought product should get more exposure,\u201d a senior official wrote.  One way to get that exposure was to influence the rules governing how Google displayed search results. In 2006, Google instituted a shift in its search algorithm, known as the Big Daddy update, which penalized websites with large numbers of subpages but few inbound links. A few years later, another shift, known as Panda, penalized sites that copied text from other websites. When adjustments like these occurred, Google explained to users, they were aimed at combating \u201cindividuals or systems seeking to \u2018game\u2019 our systems in order to appear higher in search results \u2014 using low-quality \u2018content farms,\u2019 hidden text and other deceptive practices.\u201d  Left unsaid was that Google itself generates millions of new subpages without inbound links each day, a fresh page each time someone performs a search. And each of those subpages is filled with text copied from other sites. By programming its search engine to ignore other sites doing the same thing that Google was doing, critics say, the company had made it nearly impossible for competing vertical-search engines, like Foundem, to show up high in Google\u2019s results.  Shivaun and Adam sent email after email to Google executives, but no one responded with anything useful. So the Raffs started making phone calls. Those didn\u2019t help much, either. Adam and Shivaun had worked in technology for decades. They were well known and had connections to important people inside Google and at other big firms. But none of that seemed to matter.  As the months went by and Foundem\u2019s bank accounts dwindled, the Raffs, desperate, began approaching other websites, offering to adapt their technology to power those sites\u2019 internal search engines. Soon they were providing back-end technology for a popular motorcycle site and a large magazine publisher. Eventually, about 2.5 million people were seeing Foundem\u2019s search results each month. Foundem was named one of Britain\u2019s best travel comparison sites by The Times of London and celebrated on a popular British gadget show. But without traffic from Google, the Raffs were barely holding on.  Three years passed this way. Some nights, Shivaun would sit at her computer, exhausted, Googling phrase after phrase \u2014 How do you lift a Google website penalty? Who at Google reviews mistakes? Google and deindexed and phone number and help \u2014 hoping that some magic combination of words might yield a new solution. \u201cIt just felt so unfair,\u201d Shivaun told me. \u201cWe had great technology. It was winning awards. But we couldn\u2019t even get an explanation from Google about why we weren\u2019t showing up.\u201d Eventually, they sought out a public relations firm, in the hope that a newspaper article might get Google\u2019s attention. The P.R. firm had an additional suggestion: Why not file an antitrust complaint? To Adam and Shivaun, that seemed like a waste of time. If Microsoft had been able to shrug off the antitrust attacks of the United States government, why would Google care about a complaint filed by some small firm?  But they didn\u2019t see many other options. So Adam and Shivaun pulled out their laptops and began assembling a long document detailing everything they had experienced. Then they went to Brussels, to the headquarters of the European Commission, the agency charged with regulating competitive behavior, and filed a complaint accusing Google of violating antimonopoly laws.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  As the years passed, Shivaun and Adam got into the habit of visiting message boards where people obsessively discussed Google\u2019s many peculiarities. They began to notice an interesting pattern among companies complaining about the search giant: Often, the aggrieved parties had, in some way, posed some kind of threat to Google\u2019s business. And they seemed to have suffered dire consequences.  There was, for instance, Skyhook Wireless, which had invented a new navigation system that competed with Google\u2019s location software and had signed major deals with the cellphone manufacturers Samsung and Motorola. Skyhook\u2019s accuracy \u201cis better than ours,\u201d one Google manager speculated in an internal email later revealed in a lawsuit filed by Skyhook against Google. Not long after that note was written, according to the lawsuit, a high-ranking Google official pressured Samsung and Motorola to end their relationships with Skyhook \u2014 and implied that if they didn\u2019t, Google could make it impossible for them to ship their phones on time. (Google has denied doing anything inappropriate.) Soon, Samsung and Motorola canceled their Skyhook contracts. Skyhook sued Google, and though one suit was dismissed, Google ended up paying $90 million to settle a patent-infringement claim. But by then it was too late. Skyhook\u2019s founders, bereft of other partnership options, had been forced to sell their company at a large discount.  Then there was Yelp, a website with millions of user-generated reviews of local brewpubs, auto-body shops and other businesses. Yelp grew quickly as local queries \u2014 like \u201cbest nearby steakhouse\u201d \u2014 became a third of all online searches. For years, Yelp appeared near or at the top of millions of Google searches. Google, hoping to capitalize on that traffic, tried to buy Yelp in 2009, but Yelp\u2019s founders rejected those advances. Then Google started pulling Yelp\u2019s content into its own results, which meant many users didn\u2019t have to visit Yelp\u2019s website. Yelp complained \u2014 to Google and later to the F.T.C. \u2014 but Google said the only alternative was for Yelp to remove its content from Google altogether, according to documents filed with federal regulators. The same thing happened at other fast-growing review sites like TripAdvisor and Citysearch, which also complained to the F.T.C. \u201cWe still exist,\u201d says Luther Lowe, a vice president at Yelp, \u201cbut Google did everything it could to ensure that we\u2019d never present a threat to them. It\u2019s bullying, but they\u2019re the 800-pound gorilla.\u201d  The more Adam and Shivaun looked, the more examples they found. Getty Images had created a popular search engine to help users comb through the firm\u2019s 170 million photographs and other visual art. Then, in 2013, Google adjusted how it displayed images so that rather than directing people to Getty\u2019s website, users could easily see and download Getty\u2019s high-definition images from Google itself. \u201cOur traffic immediately fell 85 percent,\u201d says Yoko Miyashita, Getty\u2019s general counsel. \u201cWe wrote to Google, and said, Hey, this isn\u2019t cool. And their response was, \u2018Well, if you don\u2019t agree to these terms, we\u2019ll just exclude you\u2019 \u201d \u2014 by letting Getty remove itself from the search engine entirely, Miyashita said. \u201cThat\u2019s not really a choice, because if you aren\u2019t on Google, you basically don\u2019t exist.\u201d  TradeComet.com, which operated a vertical-search engine for finding business products, initially prospered by buying ads on Google, but as the site grew, Google \u201craised my prices by 10,000 percent, which strangled our business virtually overnight,\u201d the company\u2019s C.E.O. at the time, Dan Savage, said when he filed an antitrust lawsuit in 2009. KinderStart.com, a vertical-search engine for parents, sued Google after it received a \u201cPageRank\u201d of zero, making it essentially unfindable. (TradeComet.com\u2019s suit was dismissed on a technicality; KinderStart.com\u2019s was dismissed for insufficient evidence.)

Shivaun and Adam filled notepads with the names of companies that had complained about Google\u2019s tactics \u2014 eJustice, a vertical-search engine for legal information; NexTag, the fellow price-comparison site; BDZV, a group of German newspapers. They printed out lawsuits and regulatory complaints until their living room was a maze of paper.  Eventually the Raffs reached out to the F.T.C., which, they knew, was the American equivalent of the European Commission\u2019s antitrust office, and the U.S. regulators invited them to visit. The F.T.C.\u2019s staff, it turned out, had been quietly collecting complaints about Google for years. In 2012, those officials wrote a confidential 160-page report that said Google had \u201cadopted a strategy of demoting, or refusing to display, links to certain vertical websites in highly commercial categories.\u201d That memo, about half of which was accidentally sent to reporters at The Wall Street Journal after they submitted a Freedom of Information Act request, said that \u201cGoogle\u2019s conduct has resulted \u2014 and will result \u2014 in real harm to consumers and to innovation.\u201d  \u201cGoogle has strengthened its monopolies over search and search advertising through anticompetitive means,\u201d which \u201cwill have lasting negative effects on consumer welfare,\u201d F.T.C. officials wrote. They cited instances in which Google seemed purposely to be privileging less useful information, substandard search results and suboptimal links. \u201cAlthough it displays its flight search above any natural search results for flight-booking sites, Google does not provide the most flight options for travelers,\u201d the regulators wrote. Whereas a decade earlier someone searching for steakhouses would have seen a long list of websites, now the most noticeable results pointed to Google\u2019s own listings, including Google maps, Google local search or advertisers paying Google. Some F.T.C. staff recommended \u201cthat the Commission issue a complaint against Google\u201d for copying material and certain advertising and contract practices, though not search-engine bias.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Google responded to the report\u2019s claims by arguing that the changes it made to the search engine benefited users. \u201cOur testing has consistently showed that users want quick answers to their queries,\u201d Google said in a statement when contacted about this article. \u201cIf you are searching for weather, you probably want a forecast, not just links to weather sites.\u201d And when it comes to online shopping, the statement read, \u201cif someone is searching for products, they likely want information about price and where they can buy it. They probably don\u2019t want to be taken to another site where they have to enter their search again. . . . We absolutely do not make changes to our search algorithm to disadvantage competitors.\u201d Claims to the contrary, like those made by Foundem, are untrue, Google maintained. \u201cWe make hundreds of changes to search every year, all with the same goal: Delivering users the best, most relevant search results,\u201d the company continued. \u201cEach change, large and small, affects millions of sites, some who see their rankings improve, others who drop.\u201d And, Google concluded, \u201cour ultimate responsibility is to deliver the best results possible to our users, not specific placements for sites within our results.\u201d  When the F.T.C.\u2019s politically appointed leadership considered the staff\u2019s recommendations, they declined to sue Google, surprising many inside the agency. \u201cWhile not everything Google did was beneficial, on balance, we did not believe that the evidence supported an F.T.C. challenge,\u201d the agency\u2019s chairman at the time, Jon Leibowitz, said when he announced the decision in 2013.  The F.T.C.\u2019s decision, according to agency insiders, was motivated in part by a debate that has also sparked battles within antitrust courts over the last 40 years: Should the law protect consumers or encourage competition? They\u2019re not always synonymous. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t consumers who were complaining about Standard,\u201d says Hovenkamp, the antitrust scholar. \u201cIt was the other oil companies.\u201d Similarly, few users are kvetching about Google; it\u2019s primarily other tech firms. United States judges have increasingly held that the government must show consumer harm to win in court.  Adam and Shivaun didn\u2019t have to wait for the official F.T.C. announcement to know that their case was going nowhere. Meeting with officials in Washington, they could tell: These people were not going to prosecute. They had come to the United States at their own expense. They had written memo after memo arguing that Google was treating them unfairly and as a result hurting users. They had done everything they were asked. Standard Oil controlled 64 percent of the market for refined petroleum when the Supreme Court broke it into dozens of pieces. Google and Facebook today control an estimated 60 to 70 percent of the U.S. digital advertising market. And the F.T.C. seemed happy to let them keep doing it. To the Raffs, it felt as if history was repeating itself, as if the pointless, ineffectual Microsoft case was happening all over again. It felt as if nobody cared.  If you are younger than 29 \u2014 which just happens to be the average age of a Google employee, according to a survey done by PayScale \u2014 then odds are good you don\u2019t remember much about the Microsoft antitrust battles of the 1990s. So, a quick primer: For almost a decade, starting in 1993, federal and state prosecutors besieged Microsoft in courtrooms across the nation, arguing that the company had acted in ways that were predatory and dishonest to preserve its software monopoly. One Microsoft executive was quoted in court as threatening to \u201ccut off\u201d the \u201cair supply\u201d of a competitor. \u201cIs Bill Gates the \u201990s answer to Don Corleone?\u201d Time magazine asked. \u201cI expected to find a bloody computer monitor in my bed,\u201d a witness told investigators.  Along the way, Microsoft was accused of widespread bullying, coercion and general obnoxiousness. And Microsoft basically said: Whatever. \u201cThere\u2019s one guy in charge of licenses,\u201d Bill Gates told reporters after he signed a consent decree with the Department of Justice in 1994. \u201cHe\u2019ll read the agreement.\u201d Everyone else, the implication was, would ignore it.  Even when a judge ruled in 2000 that Microsoft was violating antitrust law, conventional wisdom held that the victory was largely pyrrhic. Microsoft successfully appealed, and prosecutors eventually threw in the towel, agreeing to abandon their attacks and settle if Microsoft agreed to token reforms, such as making its products more compatible with competitors\u2019 software and giving three independent observers unfettered access to the company\u2019s records, employees and source code. Microsoft\u2019s executives thought that three observers, versus 48,000 employees, sounded like pretty good odds.  This was the history the Raffs recalled when they heard the F.T.C. was abandoning its investigation. But then, they also remembered a discussion they had once had with a lawyer named Gary Reback, who told them that everything they\u2019d heard about the Microsoft trials was wrong. Reback is something of a legend in Silicon Valley, both because of his accomplishments as an antitrust provocateur and because of his anxious \u2014 some might say paranoid \u2014 worldview. Reback has been known to call other lawyers late at night and leave long, obsessively detailed voice mail messages about legal arguments and economic theories. He was featured on a 1997 cover of Wired magazine with the headline \u201cThis Lawyer Is Bill Gates\u2019s Worst Nightmare,\u201d a boast that wasn\u2019t far-off: Working on behalf of clients like Netscape and Sun Microsystems, Reback had browbeaten the Department of Justice into suing Microsoft for antitrust.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  By the time Adam and Shivaun started visiting the F.T.C., Reback had exchanged his antipathy of Microsoft for a disdain of Google and had accompanied them on their visits with regulators. There\u2019s a loose coalition of economists and legal theorists who call themselves the New Brandeis Movement (critics call them \u201cantitrust hipsters\u201d), who believe that today\u2019s tech giants pose threats as significant as Standard Oil a century ago. \u201cAll of the money spent online is going to just a few companies now,\u201d says Reback (who disdains the New Brandeis label). \u201cThey don\u2019t need dynamite or Pinkertons to club their competitors anymore. They just need algorithms and data.\u201d  Reback had told Adam and Shivaun that it was important for them to keep up their fight, no matter the setbacks, and as evidence he pointed to the Microsoft trial. Anyone who said that the 1990s prosecution of Microsoft didn\u2019t accomplish anything \u2014 that it was companies like Google, rather than government lawyers, that humbled Microsoft \u2014 didn\u2019t know what they were talking about, Reback said. In fact, he argued, the opposite was true: The antitrust attacks on Microsoft made all the difference. Condemning Microsoft as a monopoly is why Google exists today, he said.  Surprisingly, some people who worked at Microsoft in the 1990s and early 2000s agree with him. In the days when federal prosecutors were attacking Microsoft day and night, the company might have publicly brushed off the salvos, insiders say. But within the workplace, the attitude was totally different. As the government sued, Microsoft executives became so anxious and gun-shy that they essentially undermined their own monopoly out of terror they might be pilloried again. It wasn\u2019t the consent decrees or court decisions that made the difference, according to multiple current and former Microsoft employees. It was \u201cthe constant scrutiny and being in the newspaper all the time,\u201d said Gene Burrus, a former Microsoft lawyer. \u201cPeople started second-guessing themselves. No one wanted to test the regulators anymore.\u201d  In public, Bill Gates was declaring victory, but inside Microsoft, executives were demanding that lawyers and other compliance officials \u2014 the kinds of people who, previously, were routinely ignored \u2014 be invited to every meeting. Software engineers began casually dropping by attorneys\u2019 desks and describing new software features, and then asking, in desperate whispers, if anything they\u2019d mentioned might trigger a subpoena. One Microsoft senior executive moved an extra chair into his office so a compliance official could sit alongside him during product reviews. Every time a programmer detailed a new idea, the executive turned to the official, who would point his thumb up or down like a capricious Roman emperor.  In the early 2000s, Microsoft\u2019s top executives told some divisions that their plans would be proactively shared with competitors \u2014 literally describing what the company intended to create before software was even built \u2014 to make sure it wouldn\u2019t offend anyone who was likely to sue. Microsoft\u2019s engineers were outraged. But they went along with it.  And most important, as Microsoft lived under government scrutiny, employees abandoned what had been nascent internal discussions about crushing a young, emerging competitor \u2014 Google. There had been informal conjectures about reprogramming Microsoft\u2019s web browser, the popular Internet Explorer, so that anytime people typed in \u201cGoogle,\u201d they would be redirected to MSN Search, according to company insiders. Or, perhaps a warning message might pop up: \u201cDid you know Google uses your data in ways you can\u2019t control?\u201d  Microsoft was so powerful, and Google so new, that the young search engine could have been killed off, some insiders at both companies believe. \u201cBut there was a new culture of compliance, and we didn\u2019t want to get in trouble again, so nothing happened,\u201d Burrus said. The myth that Google humbled Microsoft on its own is wrong. The government\u2019s antitrust lawsuit is one reason that Google was eventually able to break Microsoft\u2019s monopoly.  \u201cIf Microsoft hadn\u2019t been sued, all of technology would be different today,\u201d Reback told me. We\u2019ve known since Standard Oil that advances in technology make it easier for monopolies to emerge. But what\u2019s less recognized is the importance of antitrust in making sure those new technologies spread to everyone else. In 1969 the Justice Department started a lawsuit against IBM for antitrust violations that lasted 13 years. The government eventually surrendered, but in an earlier attempt to mollify prosecutors, IBM eliminated its practice of bundling hardware and software, a shift that essentially created the software industry. Suddenly, new start-ups could get a foothold simply by writing programs rather than building machines. Microsoft was founded a few years later and soon outpaced IBM.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Or consider AT&T, which was sued by the government in 1974, fought in court for eight years and then slyly agreed to divest itself of some businesses if it could keep its most valuable assets. Critics complained AT&T was getting the deal of a lifetime. But then start-ups like Sprint and MCI made millions building on technologies AT&T championed, and AT&T found itself struggling to compete. It\u2019s completely wrong to say that antitrust doesn\u2019t matter, Reback argues. \u201cThe internet only exists because we broke up AT&T. The software industry exists because Johnson sued IBM.\u201d  It was critical that the Raffs continue fighting, Reback told them. Social embarrassment and sustained attacks have the power to succeed when courtrooms or political agencies fail. After their F.T.C. disappointment, the Raffs flew back to England to consider their options. And then one night they were at home watching television when the phone rang. Someone they had met in Brussels was calling to share some remarkable news. The European Commission had issued a decision on the complaint they filed six years before.  What changed everything was a middle-aged Danish politician named Margrethe Vestager, who had recently been named the European Union\u2019s commissioner for competition. Vestager was an unusual choice for the post. She wasn\u2019t a populist crusader or a pro-business acolyte; she was, instead, a moderate whose claim to fame, at that point, was having served as an inspiration for the television show \u201cBorgen,\u201d a fictional series about a Danish politician. But Vestager was awarded the commissioner\u2019s post in 2014 after arguing that European marketplaces needed to do a better job of giving everyone an equal chance to succeed. Since assuming her office, Vestager has become, unexpectedly, the most prominent antitrust official in the world, invited to speak at conferences and mobbed by autograph seekers.  By the time Vestager took office, Google had already transitioned its price-comparison service to its present incarnation, which is effectively an advertising system that prominently features links only from companies that pay for the promotion. (Users are notified by a small logo that says \u201csponsored.\u201d) After reviewing the complaints submitted by the Raffs and others, Vestager announced she intended to formally charge Google with antitrust violations. (She has also embarked on investigations into the European tax practices of Starbucks, Amazon and Apple, as well as anticompetitive tactics at Qualcomm, Facebook and Gazprom.)  Over the next two years, Vestager\u2019s staff reviewed data from 1.7 billion Google queries. They scrutinized how people fared when they conducted searches on topics in which Google had a vested interest, versus those where the company had nothing to gain. Then, in June of last year, the commission issued its final verdict: \u201cWhat Google has done is illegal under E.U. antitrust rules,\u201d Vestager said in a statement released at the time. \u201cIt denied other companies the chance to compete on the merits and to innovate. And most important, it denied European consumers a genuine choice of services and the full benefits of innovation.\u201d Google was ordered to stop giving its own comparison-shopping service an illegal advantage and was fined an eye-popping $2.7 billion, the largest such penalty in the European Commission\u2019s history and more than twice as large as any such fine ever levied by the United States.  The verdict rocked Silicon Valley. Some think Europe\u2019s assertiveness makes it more likely American regulators will act as well. And there\u2019s evidence that\u2019s already starting. Donald Trump appealed to voters, in part, by attacking the tech monopolies. In a case of truly odd bedfellows, that puts him in alignment with Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, who have long called for greater scrutiny of technology companies. Last year, a group of Democratic lawmakers in Congress, led by Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, sponsored legislation to boost antitrust enforcement by forcing companies to assume the burden of showing that a merger won\u2019t hurt the public.  Meanwhile, a bipartisan assortment of state attorneys general have urged the F.T.C. to reopen its investigation of Google. Most major antitrust battles, including the federal suits against Microsoft and Standard Oil, have begun as state actions. A Missouri investigation is particularly notable because the state\u2019s Republican attorney general, Josh Hawley, who is running for the United States Senate, has subpoenaed information to see if Google has manipulated searches to disadvantage potential competitors. \u201cThe Obama-era F.T.C. did not take any enforcement action against Google, did not press this forward and has essentially given them a free pass,\u201d Hawley told reporters after revealing his inquiry in November. \u201cI will not let Missouri consumers and businesses be exploited by industry giants.\u201d  As attacks against Google have escalated, the company has tried to limit the damage. After Yelp complained to the F.T.C. about Google\u2019s stealing its content, Google promised to make it easier for websites to opt out of automatic copying, a pledge it reaffirmed a few months ago. And earlier this month, in exchange for Getty Images\u2019 withdrawing its complaint to the European Commission, Google signed a licensing agreement with Getty promising to more clearly display images\u2019 copyright information. Other titans like Facebook are similarly trying to get ahead of criticisms, voluntarily pledging greater transparency and promising to work more cooperatively with regulators.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  The implication is clear enough: Google and the other tech titans understand that the landscape is shifting. They realize that their halos have become tarnished, that the arguments they once invoked as a digital exception to American economic history \u2014 that the internet economy is uniquely self-correcting, because competition is only a click away \u2014 no longer hold as much weight. \u201cWhen you get as big as Google, you become so powerful that the market bends around you,\u201d Vestager told me. The notion that antitrust law isn\u2019t needed anymore, that we must choose between helping consumers or spurring competition, no longer seems sufficient reason to exempt the tech giants from century-old legal codes. If anything, Vestager\u2019s verdict and state investigations indicate that companies like Google may have more in common with the monopolists of old than most people thought. Silicon Valley\u2019s bigwigs ought to be scared.  \u201cIf Europe can prosecute Google, then we can as well,\u201d says William Kovacic, a law professor and former Republican-appointed chairman of the Federal Trade Commission. \u201cIt\u2019s just a question of willingness now.\u201d  If the internet\u2019s potentates are frightened, however, they\u2019re doing a good job of hiding it. Google has appealed the European Commission\u2019s decision and has vigorously defended itself online. The company\u2019s arguments are the same ones that it was putting forth on company blogs over the course of the investigation. \u201cWe disagree with the European Commission\u2019s argument that our improved Google Shopping results are harming competition,\u201d Google\u2019s top lawyer wrote in one post. The commission \u201cdrew such a narrow definition around online shopping services that it even excluded services like Amazon,\u201d undermining the contention that Google is dominant. \u201cGoogle delivered more than 20 billion free clicks to aggregators over the last decade,\u201d he wrote in another post. Forcing it to \u201cdirect more clicks to price-comparison aggregators would just subsidize sites that have become less useful for consumers.\u201d Google\u2019s data indicates that users appreciate how the search engine has shifted over the years. \u201cThat\u2019s not \u2018favoring\u2019 \u201d Google\u2019s interests, the company said. \u201cThat\u2019s giving customers and advertisers what they find most useful.\u201d  Some legal theorists think that Google might have a point. \u201cTo what extent are consumers, rather than competitors, being harmed by Google?\u201d says Hovenkamp, the antitrust scholar. \u201cIf the answer is \u2018not much,\u2019 then I\u2019m suspicious of an antitrust remedy.\u201d Others say the risks are too high. \u201cThere are very real costs associated with suing a company like Google,\u201d says Geoffrey Manne, executive director of the International Center for Law & Economics, a nonpartisan research center. \u201cYou\u2019re potentially impairing a firm that provides vital services to millions of people, and potentially benefiting competitors who don\u2019t deserve that support.\u201d  Those are fair arguments. But they are also, in some ways, beside the point. Antitrust has never been just about costs and benefits or fairness. It\u2019s never been about whether we love the monopolist. People loved Standard Oil a century ago, and Microsoft in the 1990s, just as they love Google today.  Rather, antitrust has always been about progress. Antitrust prosecutions are part of how technology grows. Antitrust laws ultimately aren\u2019t about justice, as if success were something to be condemned; instead, they are a tool that society uses to help start-ups build on a monopolist\u2019s breakthroughs without, in the process, being crushed by the monopolist. And then, if those start-ups prosper and make discoveries of their own, they eventually become monopolies themselves, and the cycle starts anew. If Microsoft had crushed Google two decades ago, no one would have noticed. Today we would happily be using Bing, unaware that a better alternative once existed. Instead, we\u2019re lucky a quixotic antitrust lawsuit helped to stop that from happening. We\u2019re lucky that antitrust lawyers unintentionally guaranteed that Google would thrive.  Put differently, if you love technology \u2014 if you always buy the latest gadgets and think scientific advances are powerful forces for good \u2014 then perhaps you ought to cheer on the antitrust prosecutors. Because there is no better method for keeping the marketplace constructive and creative than a legal system that intervenes whenever a company, no matter how beloved, grows so large as to blot out the sun. If you love Google, you should hope the government sues it for antitrust offenses \u2014 and you should hope it happens soon, because who knows what wondrous new creations are waiting patiently in the wings.  For the Raffs, however, it\u2019s probably too late. By the time Vestager announced her verdict and record-setting fine last year, it had been 12 years since Adam and Shivaun started Foundem.com. During that time, their lives slowly but inexorably became devoted to battling Google. They had spent thousands of hours corresponding with regulatory agencies across the globe. They had filed a civil suit against Google in British court, a case that is ongoing. They basically shut down Foundem, creating more time for them to give advice to other companies and regulators fighting Google. This consulting work, some of which was funded by Google\u2019s competitors, has helped to keep the Raffs afloat. And if the Raffs win their lawsuit against Google, it could be worth millions. \u201cBut it\u2019s a different business model than we expected,\u201d Adam told me. \u201cIt\u2019s also deeply frustrating, because we became technologists in order to build new technologies. We never intended to be professional plaintiffs or antitrust crusaders.\u201d  One of the most difficult things for the Raffs over the past decade has been figuring out how to explain this journey to themselves and others. Even friends and family didn\u2019t fully understand what was going on. \u201cIt feels really good to be validated like this, to be told we were right,\u201d Shivaun told me, referring to Vestager\u2019s verdict. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t turn back the clock and give us another chance. Even if we win in Brussels, or win our lawsuit, in some ways, we were still defeated. We were still beaten by Google.\u201d", "stock": "GOOGL", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-20", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/20/magazine/the-case-against-google.html"}, {"article": "Q.

In some cases, these algorithms are more accurate than something that is designed solely by engineers.  The new service is part of a widespread effort to expand the power of modern A.I. to businesses that are largely unfamiliar with this rapidly evolving technology. Like Google, a New York start-up called Clarifai offers an online service that helps customers train computer vision algorithms.  At the same time, several other start-ups, like Boston\u2019s DataRobot and Silicon Valley\u2019s H2O.ai, offer services designed to help businesses analyze the way products, customers, markets and employees behaved in the past and predict how they will perform in the future.  \u201cThey aim to automate data science in general,\u201d said Randy Olson, a data scientist at Life Epigenetics, a company in Portland, Ore.

A Google product manager, Rajen Sheth, said the company would work with these customers to determine the price.  Risto Miikkulainen, a professor of computer science at the University of Texas at Austin who has long explored the kind of technology that underpins Google\u2019s new service, agreed that it had the potential to help other businesses build their own A.I.  \u201cIt is really powerful technology,\u201d said Mr. Miikkulainen, who is also vice president of research at Sentient Technologies.  But sometimes, there is no substitute for good old human labor. With Google\u2019s new service, humans must label the data before the system can learn from it. Google can provide the human labelers, as do companies like CrowdFlower.  And even when an online service successfully automates a task, it\u2019s not necessarily worth using.  James Bradley and his London company, NMT Vision, once used Clarifai to train and operate algorithms to identify websites that are selling products that infringe on copyrights. But he and his company now handle this on their own, mainly because the cost is lower.  Services like DataRobot and H20.ai may bill themselves as automated data scientists, but here, too, automation has its limits. \u201cThese services are only as good as their parts,\u201d said Patrick Dougherty, a data scientist with the Seattle-based firm Slalom Consulting. \u201cAnd humans still supply some of the parts.\u201d  Google says that once images are labeled, its new service operates without human involvement.

Can I have a conversation with Google Assistant, or will there be an update in the future that will let me have one?  A. Google Assistant, the company\u2019s voice-based helper software that is similar to Amazon\u2019s Alexa, Apple\u2019s Siri and Microsoft\u2019s Cortana software, can already hold basic two-way conversations based on spoken or typed questions and commands. However, more intricate interaction with all these virtual assistant apps is coming as companies expand their research into the scientific areas of artificial intelligence, machine learning and natural language processing. (For those with privacy concerns, keep in mind that most virtual assistant software is designed to collect personal data.)  The Google Assistant software is available as an app for Android and iOS devices, built into Google Home and other speakers, Android-based wearables, cars, televisions, smart-home appliances and other gear. If you are not sure how to talk to the program, the Google Assistant site has a lengthy list of the questions, commands and topics that you can use with the software, complete with suggestions on how to phrase your requests.

The new restriction would apply both to space on Google\u2019s platforms, like YouTube, and to third-party websites where Google sells advertising space.  Facebook announced in January that it would ban all ads for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in order to stop misleading and deceptive promotions.

Photo  \u201cThey\u2019re not able to police their platforms when the type of content that they\u2019re promising to prohibit changes on a too-frequent basis,\u201d Jonathon Morgan, founder of New Knowledge, a company that tracks disinformation online, said of Facebook and YouTube.  The difficulty of dealing with inappropriate online content stands out with the Parkland shooting because the tech companies have effectively committed to removing any accusations that the Parkland survivors were actors, a step they did not take after other recent mass shootings, such as last October\u2019s massacre in Las Vegas. In the past, the companies typically addressed specific types of content only when it was illegal \u2014 posts from terrorist organizations, for example \u2014 Mr. Morgan said.  Facebook and YouTube\u2019s promises follow a stream of criticism in recent months over how their sites can be gamed to spread Russian propaganda, among other abuses. The companies have said they are betting big on artificial intelligence systems to help identify and take down inappropriate content, though that technology is still being developed.  The companies have in the meantime hired or said they plan to hire more people to comb through what is posted to their sites. Facebook said it was hiring 1,000 new moderators to review content and was making changes to what type of news publishers would be favored on the social network. YouTube has said that it plans to have 10,000 moderators by year\u2019s end and that it is altering its search algorithms to return more videos from reliable news sources.  Mary deBree, head of content policy at Facebook, said the company had not been perfect at staving off certain content and most likely would not be in the future.  \u201cFalse information is like any other challenge where humans are involved: It evolves, much like a rumor or urban legend would. It also masks itself as legitimate speech,\u201d she said. \u201cOur job is to do better at keeping this bad content off Facebook without undermining the reason people come here \u2014 to see things happening in the world around them and have a conversation about them.\u201d  Photo  A YouTube spokeswoman said in a statement that the site updated its harassment policy last year \u201cto include hoax videos that target the victims of these tragedies. Any video flagged to us that violates this policy is reviewed and then removed.\u201d  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  For many people, getting around Facebook and YouTube\u2019s hunt to remove noxious content is straightforward. The sites have automated detection systems that often search for specific terms or images that have previously been deemed unacceptable. So to evade those systems, people sometimes can alter images or switch to different terminology.  Sam Woolley, an internet researcher at the nonprofit Institute for the Future, said far-right groups had started using internet brands to describe minorities \u2014 like \u201cSkype\u201d to indicate Jewish people \u2014 to trick software and human reviewers.  Those who post conspiracy theories also tend to quickly repost or engage with similar posts from other accounts, creating a sort of viral effect that can cause the sites\u2019 algorithms to promote the content as a trending topic or a recommended video, said David Carroll, a professor at the New School who studies tech platforms.  That duplication and repackaging of misinformation \u201cmake the game of snuffing it out Whac-a-Mole to the extreme,\u201d he said.  That game played out across the web in the past few days, after a video suggesting that one of the most vocal Parkland survivors, David Hogg, was an actor became the No. 1 trending video on YouTube. After a public outcry, YouTube removed the video and said it would take down other \u201ccrisis actor\u201d videos because they violated its ban on bullying.

A video posted last week by Alex Jones, the founder of the conspiracy theory site Infowars, titled \u201cRed Alert!

One lengthy post had been shared more than 3,800 times by early Friday. The post included a photo of Mr. Hogg and his classmate Emma Gonzalez with the text \u201cGlobalist Deep State Crisis Actors.\u201d  After The New York Times contacted the author of the post, a self-described political analyst named John Miranda, the post disappeared. It is unclear if Facebook removed it. Mr. Miranda did not respond to a request for comment.  The tech companies\u2019 increasing efforts to remove misinformation have a side effect: angering some of their most active users.  Moe Othman, a comedian and commentator on YouTube who has about 60,000 subscribers, said that within 10 minutes of posting a video on Wednesday that suggested some Parkland students were actors, YouTube removed it and placed a strike on his account.

Other internet giants do much the same.  In addition to its T.P.U. chips, which sit inside its data centers, the company has designed an A.I. chip for its smartphones.  Right now, Google\u2019s new service is focused on a way to teach computers to recognize objects, called computer vision technology. But as time goes on, the new chips will also help businesses build a wider range of services, Mr. Stone said.  At the end of last year, hoping to accelerate its work on driverless cars, Lyft began testing Google\u2019s new chips.  Using the chips, Lyft wanted to accelerate the development of systems that allow driverless cars to, say, identify street signs or pedestrians. \u201cTraining\u201d these systems can take days, but with the new chips, the hope is that this will be reduced to hours.  \u201cThere is huge potential here,\u201d said Anantha Kancherla, who oversees software for the Lyft driverless car project.

A new wave of artificial intelligence, including services like Google Assistant, are driven by \u201cneural networks,\u201d which are complex algorithms that can learn tasks on their own by analyzing vast amounts of data. By analyzing a database of old customer support phone calls, for example, a neural network can learn to recognize commands spoken into a smartphone. But this requires serious computing power.  Typically, engineers train these algorithms using graphics processing units, or G.P.U.s, which are chips that were originally designed for rendering images for games and other graphics-heavy software. Most of these chips are supplied by Nvidia.  In designing its own A.I. chips, Google was looking to exceed what was possible with these graphics-oriented chips, speed up its own A.I. work and lure more businesses onto its cloud services.  At the same time, Google has gained some independence from Nvidia and an ability to negotiate lower prices with its chip suppliers.  \u201cGoogle has become so big, it makes sense to invest in chips,\u201d said Fred Weber, who spent a decade as the chief technology officer at the chip maker AMD. \u201cThat gives them leverage. They can cut out the middleman.\u201d  This does not mean that Google will stop buying chips from Nvidia and other chip makers.

But at a private event in San Francisco last fall, David Patterson, a computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who now works on chip technologies at Google, was asked if the company would go that far.  \u201cThat\u2019s not rocket science,\u201d he said.", "stock": "GOOGL", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-12", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/12/technology/google-artificial-intelligence-chips.html"}, {"article": "If the mainstream media is a perennial enemy of the right, Big Tech is a fresh and novel foe, arguably more relevant to 2018.

In May that year, Facebook was forced to respond to claims that the curators of its Trending Topics feature had suppressed conservative news sources, a controversy that called attention to Facebook\u2019s editorial power.  That charge of editorial bias was echoed last weekend by Alex Jones, the conspiracy theorist behind Infowars, who accused YouTube of planning to delete his organization\u2019s account, a claim that was widely shared among conservatives.  YouTube did delete some videos that accused teenage survivors of the Parkland, Fla., school shooting of being \u201ccrisis actors,\u201d and it issued \u201cstrikes,\u201d or warnings, to the accounts of Infowars and Jerome Corsi, a conservative author and Infowars contributor. (YouTube denied that it had plans to delete the Infowars account.)  Facebook has also caught flak for adjusting the algorithm for its News Feed to emphasize posts from \u201cfriends, family and groups\u201d over content from public pages. The change was part of an effort by the company to answer criticism, but also to reinvigorate its oldest and most profitable product, which recently recorded a decline in American daily users for the first time in its history.  The Facebook adjustment has affected virtually every media organization that is partly dependent on the platform for audiences, but it appears to have hit some harder than others. They include right-wing sites like Gateway Pundit and the millennial-focused Independent Journal Review, which was forced to lay off staff members last month.

It agreed to use the new Jaguar I-Pace, a battery-powered hatchback unveiled this month, for the service announced Tuesday. After testing, the company expects to start its ride service by the end of the year.  Mr. Krafcik, the Waymo chief, said the company intended to move forward rapidly with a driverless ride service for the public because it was confident its vehicles could operate safely in virtually any driving situation where they would be put into use. In addition to the five million miles its cars have driven in tests, Waymo has run computer simulations equivalent to five billion miles of testing. In these computer models, Waymo uses software to make virtual test drives even more complicated by adding more pedestrians and making distances between cars shorter than in typical road situations, he said.  At a closed site in California, Waymo also tests the performance of its cars in traffic situations based on actual crashes. \u201cWe think we will be the safety benchmark for the world,\u201d said Mr. Krafcik, who worked in operations at Ford and then was Hyundai\u2019s United States chief before his arrival at Waymo.  He noted that Waymo cars were equipped with highly sensitive cameras, radar and three different types of lidar \u2014 a kind of radar based on lasers \u2014 to identify objects, pedestrians and other cars.  Even with the vast computing power of Google, which operates giant data centers around the world, Waymo won\u2019t be able to train its computerized \u201cdriver\u201d to be prepared for everything. \u201cThere are going to be things we can\u2019t predict,\u201d Adam Jonas, an automotive analyst at Morgan Stanley, said at the J.

Elaine Herzberg, 49, was walking her bicycle across the road at a spot without a crosswalk when she was struck. Videos taken by cameras mounted in the Uber vehicle show the safety driver was looking down just before the impact.  The Uber crash prompted Toyota to suspend testing its self-driving cars on public roads as a precaution, although Ford Motor and General Motors said they were proceeding with their efforts.

It wants to develop self-driving technology that it can put into cars made by partners, and intends to operate them in a ride service.  Waymo also expects to put its technology into trucks and delivery vehicles, as well as buses or other vehicles that ferry riders to mass transportation systems. And it hopes to license the technology to carmakers, auto technology suppliers or other companies.  Mr. Krafcik said Waymo expected these efforts to become a highly profitable business, but declined to say how long that could take. Alphabet, the parent of Waymo and Google, \u201ctends to take a very long-term approach,\u201d he said.", "stock": "GOOGL", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-27", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/27/business/waymo-driverless.html"}, {"article": "It\u2019s far too early to pass a verdict on the Google Home. However, what\u2019s clear after four days of using this, is that it\u2019s an early adopter\u2019s product. In the Indian context, it\u2019s not a product that will serve any real purpose in your life, at least not yet.  I have always maintained that AI platforms become slightly dumber in India. Yet, if we were to compare the level of intelligence these platforms are capable of, the Google Assistant would almost always come out shining, just ahead of Amazon\u2019s Alexa and followed by Microsoft\u2019s Cortana.  Yeah, let's not even talk about Siri here.  In India, smart assistants are still learning. If these were real people, the Indian versions of these assistants would be the equivalent of school children, while global/US versions feel more intelligent, like college kids. It's a long way to adulthood either way.  And on that note, let's talk about the Google Home. A smart home product, that, like the Amazon Echo, has been talked about in some detail. So much so that you may even be expecting the one speaker to rule them all here.  Alas! Amazon couldn't do it and neither can Google. I'll skip over the bits about design here since my global colleagues have written about it already.  Using the Google Home in India  Like the Echo before it, the Home is very much an early adopter\u2019s product in India. The primary difference is that unlike other such products, it's not big riddled and gives you the full experience of what you can expect.  That said, there's work to be done as far as app support etc. are concerned. The Home plays music from Play Music only right now. So, when you ask for a song, it will search through Google's catalogues and find the best match. Often, that isn't close to being right. A tad too often to be honest.  I asked the Home to play \u2018New York, New York\u2019 by Frank Sinatra. It played \u2018One For My Baby\u2019 by the same artist. Google\u2019s My Activity page shows what the Home heard: \u201cPlay up the road by Frank Sinatra\u201d. So, it found the closest match.  The My Activity page also tells me that I asked it to \u201cplay tennis\u201d once. I surely didn't. However, it was up to the task when I asked it to \u201cplay some Michael Buble\u201d or \u201cplay Havana\u201d. The margin for error here is the same as the Echo, and having used the Echo for just over six odd months now, I'm pretty accustomed to it.  In hindsight, the Echo started off similarly, before getting used to my accent and pronunciation. And it still misses at times. I'm hoping Google's AI copes better and learns faster.  What I don't like though is how often the Home just doesn't register a command. I've had to modulate my voice quite often with the Home. That's especially frustrating when you wake up in the middle of the night and ask for something.  The Home just sat there often, while I screamed - \u201cHey Google\u201d, \u201cOk, Google\u201d, \u201cOii! Google\u201d and more. To be clear, only the first two commands would and should have woken the speaker up. The Home seems to go into a slumber at times and refuses to wake up.  When it does listen, I can ask for reminders to be set, jokes to be told, time, travel info and more. Pretty much anything that the Google Assistant can do, the Home can do, too.  Smart Home  I had a lone Philips Hue Ambiance bulb to test the Home with. The Hue\u2019s smart home Bridge needs to be set up before the Google Home can control it. The Home and Hue Bridge have to be on the same WiFi network for this to work.  You can toggle the intensity of the Hue Ambiance or turn it on/off using the Home. Once set up, you can control it from anywhere using the Google Assistant, as long as you're connected. I had the Home and Echo dot placed side-by-side on the same network, and the lag time between command and activity are the same on both.  Setting up the Hue is obscenely easy. The Home app by Google has a \"Home Control\" section. You head over here, tap on the \"+\" icon and add devices. Done. The Home asks for your Philips Hue account and automatically connects the Hue Bridge you set up earlier.  The Hue Ambiance is rather limited in what it can do, but the Home can control the full suite of things other Hue bulbs can do.  Controlling smart homes though is a niche utility in India, to say the least. The Hue Ambiance, which is the cheapest in Philips' portfolio, is priced at just over Rs 2,000 here. Other Hue bulbs often touch upwards of Rs 10,000. If you're already invested in IoT products, the Home might be a good idea.  What remains to be seen is whether the ecosystem develops around this. Google boasts extensive support for smart home products, though most of the brands aren't doing business in India just yet. Like Amazon, the company will have to push for these brands to start selling here.  App support  Amazon boasts over 10,000 skills for Alexa in India, so Google needs to catch up. That said, the Assistant already has a bunch of usable skills in the country.  Yet, the Home lacks app support. It has support for Gaana and Saavn at the moment and Google says it wants to add more. However, apps like Uber and all others need to be added.  The brightside is that support for Google Cast covers a lot of your media requirements. Apps like Pocket Casts, Wynk and some others can stream to the Home directly via Google Cast.  Audio Quality  The Home and Echo aren't meant to be audio products. Yet, if you do buy a speaker, the audio experience is worth noting. What I can confirm here is that the Home sounds decidedly better than the Echo. Michael Buble's baritone voice sounds better and more detailed on the Home when compared to the Echo. The music experience, in general, is richer too.  As a standalone speaker, the Home is more versatile than the Echo. It's loud enough to fill a room or two - though that would really depend on the size of your rooms. I have 10x10 rooms in my house, which are well served.  That said, don\u2019t go expecting UE Boom/Wonderboom-level audio quality.  Summing up  It's been just four days with the Home, so I can't quite pass a weighty verdict yet. But, as I said before, the Google Home is an early adopter's product. If you're buying this, you're either gifting it to a geek or a geek yourself.  It doesn't have real usage that will change your life. It's not a product you NEED, it's a product you really, really want. For those who do buy it, the novelty will wear off in a few weeks, after which we'll have to wait till India catches up with the global standards in smart homes.  If Google is to sell this to the general public, it will have to have offline stores to show the Home. It\u2019s an experiential product. One that you want only after you\u2019ve...umm...spoken to it.  Price and offers  The Google Home is priced at Rs 9,999 in India, while the Home Mini will sell for Rs 4,499. Both products are available on Flipkart and retail stores like Croma, Reliance Digital, Vijay Sales and more.  Google is also bundling a JioFi router and \u201cstreaming music subscriptions\u201d with the Home. If you buy the product at Reliance Digital stores, you will get a JioFi router with 100GB 4G data, while Croma outlets will bundle the Philips Hue with the Home and Home Mini.", "stock": "GOOGL", "label": 1, "date": "2018-04-10", "source": "techradar", "url": "https://www.techradar.com/reviews/google-home-india"}, {"article": "Google Wifi is the easiest and most manageable router that we\u2019ve ever set up, period. It might not be the most powerful or offer precise controls, but it more than makes up for any lack of depth in unmatched simplicity.  As devices like Netgear Orbi and Eero have shown: the age of routers and range extenders has ended. The future is tri-band or Wi-Fi mesh systems. And, surprising no one, the smart-home obsessed Google is all over it with the eponymous Google Wifi  And, it turns out that Google may have very well crafted the best Wi-Fi mesh system yet. Google\u2019s managed to create a system that offers more mesh units than competitors at a lower price, and a focus on simple setup and management. The result? We never want to look at another router again.  Price and availability  Unsurprisingly, Google doesn\u2019t ask for a lot of money for what\u2019s on offer. Google Wifi costs $279 (about \u00a3197, AU$360) for a set of three units \u2013 that\u2019s one primary \u2018WiFi Point\u2019 (the one you hook up to the modem or gateway) and two secondary WiFi Points.  In the UK, Google Wifi comes with a two unit set costing \u00a3229.  A single Google Wifi unit can be had for $119 (around \u00a384, AU$153). Google promises that three Wifi Points can cover up to 4,500 square feet (418 square meters) in a home.  Unfortunately, at the time of writing, Google has made no mentions of pricing or availability in Australia. However, when we spoke to Google just before the UK launch, it suggested that it was looking to release Google Wifi globally in the future.  Google offers more units for less money than any competitor, like the Netgear Orbi, with all others costing at least $400 (about \u00a3320, AU$520) for the same amount.  Spec Sheet Wireless Connectivity: IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, AC1200 2x2 Wave 2 Wi-Fi (expandable mesh; dual-band 2.4GHz and 5GHz, TX beamforming); Bluetooth Smart ready Processor: Quad-core ARM CPU (each core up to 710MHz) Memory: 512MB RAM Storage: 4GB eMMC flash Beamforming: Implicit and Explicit for 2.4 & 5GHz bands Ports: 2 x Gigabit Ethernet ports per Wifi point (1 WAN and 1 LAN port each) Dimensions: 4.1 x 2.7 inches (106.1 x 68.7mm; D x H) each Weight: 12oz (340g) each  Design and setup  Not only does Google have the clear advantage of pricing on its hands, but it also has the best-designed individual units and easiest setup of any offering. Each Google Wifi unit, a tiny, unassuming cylinder with a simple white LED band in its center, is capable of the same functionality.  This means that any of the three units could function as the \u201crouter\u201d of the system, while the others can bestow wired internet (which is beamed to the unit wirelessly) with their included Ethernet ports as well as wireless internet. All three units are powered via USB-C.  Setup is as sublime as Google\u2019s hardware design, using a free iOS and Android app to facilitate the process. While we won\u2019t belabor you with the entire procedure, but the app configures your Wi-Fi network by first scanning the QR code on the Wifi Points connected to your modem or gateway and power.  From there, the app tells you to name your network and set a password, then pair the additional Wifi Points and label them in the app for reference. Again, it takes seconds for the \u201crouter\u201d to recognize the Wifi Points and for them to begin broadcasting.  But, you\u2019re not going to get the same depth of access as even Netgear Orbi provides, so no band switching for you. However, Google Wifi handles this in the background automatically.  However, the app offers plenty more useful features, like constant monitoring of your network, its Points and the devices connected to it. The app has an included internet speed test similar to that of Ookla\u2019s, a mesh test that measures the health of your Points\u2019 connections as well as a Wi-Fi test that measures your connection strength from within the network.  You can also prioritize bandwidth to one device for a time, control smart home devices and pause internet access to certain devices in a family setting \u2013 all from within this app.  By far, this is the most complete and elegant suite of control settings we\u2019ve seen from a Wi-Fi mesh system so far, despite its lack of dropdown boxes and toggles.  Benchmarks Here is how the Google Wifi fared in our brief suite of tests (conducted on a 100Mbps service): Ookla Speed Test 5GHz (Download | Upload): Within 5 feet/1.52 meters; no obstructions: 101.41 | 117.83 Mbps Within 13 feet/3.96 meters; three plaster walls: 97.05 | 118.67 Mbps Ookla Speed Test 2.4GHz (Download | Upload): Within 5 feet/1.52 meters; no obstructions: 47.53 | 96.72 Mbps Within 13 feet/3.96 meters; three plaster walls: 50.95 | 82.98 Mbps 1.5GB Steam download 5GHz (peak speed): Within 5 feet/1.52 meters; no obstructions: 12.6 MB/s Within 13 feet/3.96 meters; three plaster walls: 12.2 MB/s 1.5GB Steam download 2.4GHz (peak speed): Within 5 feet/1.52 meters; no obstructions: 7.2 MB/s Within 13 feet/3.96 meters; three plaster walls: 8.8 MB/s  Performance  We\u2019ve seen just as impressive, if not better, performance from the Google Wifi system as we have Netgear Orbi. Google Wifi draws the absolute most from our 100Mbps Wi-Fi service that we\u2019ve seen any router able to, but can do so from every room of our, albeit small, house.  We\u2019ve been able to stream 4K video through Netflix to our Roku Premiere in the basement as well as we\u2019ve been able to play Overwatch in the office where the modem is located: without issue. Wi-Fi mesh systems like Google Wifi aren\u2019t focused so much about throughput as they are coverage, but this product delivers regardless.  The traffic prioritization feature can ensure that your gaming session is getting more of that crucial bandwidth than the other devices in your house that are Facebooking and streaming HD video.  Plus, the network can automatically repair itself should one or more of the Wifi Points be accidentally unplugged or otherwise lose power.  While we know that Google Wifi operates its mesh system over existing Wi-Fi bands (2.4GHz and 5GHz) over the 802.11s mesh protocol rather than Netgear Orbi\u2019s tri-band system that communicates over a second 5GHz Wi-Fi band, we haven\u2019t found a terrible difference between either\u2019s performance. We do see slightly faster download speeds in MB/s on the 2.4GHz band from the Orbi over the Google Wifi, but that could also be an anomaly.  The true benefit of Google Wifi over others is, simply put, its coverage for the price. You can get equal amounts of coverage in pure square footage from competing systems with fewer units, but the versatility having more units gives you in terms of shoring up dead spots can\u2019t be ignored.  We liked  Google Wifi is incredibly easy to setup and manage on a day-to-day basis despite its lack of some finer control. The fact that the system includes three units for less than some competitors charge for two or fewer is also a huge benefit. Finally, these units look even better in terms of design than systems like Netgear Orbi, and are much easier to hide in plain sight.  We disliked  While there isn\u2019t much to gripe about regarding Google Wifi, some might like finer control over Wi-Fi settings, like controlling which bands are broadcast and when. Also, as it uses AC1200 technology, Google Wifi isn\u2019t capable of the AC3000 or even AC2200 throughput that Netgear Orbi and Linksys Velop are, respectively, which might turn off those paying big for super-fast internet speeds.  Final verdict  Google Wifi is the easiest router that we\u2019ve ever set up, period. And, that\u2019s considering the two extra devices required to complete it. For a relatively affordable price, Google offers more units than most competitors and the best setup and management app by far.  For all of the finer hardware controls it lacks, Google considered every toggle and test it could present in an easily understandable way through its app. (There\u2019s even bandwidth priority control.) Couple that with a hardware design that\u2019s easier to hide in plain sight than any we\u2019ve seen yet, and you\u2019re looking one of the best Wi-Fi systems that money can buy today.

Both the smart speakers function on voice commands and can perform tasks like cast audio and video, play music, get answers from Google, set reminders, tell you about your day, control smart home devices and lot more.  To make Google Assistant more relevant for Indian users, Google has added Indian customisations to the speaker.

As a Google handset it\u2019s also got a big name behind it, and like any big-name smartphone there\u2019s a wide range of cases available for the Pixel.  These range from the sleek and minimalist, to the strong and bulky, to multi-purpose cases, arty covers and more, so there\u2019s sure to be one that fits your needs and tastes.  Below, you\u2019ll find several recommendations that cover a wide range of budgets and style preferences. While some of these options are untested, they are each a cut above the rest due to their value and design, and are backed by positive consumer feedback.  Note: we've ranked these from cheapest to most expensive according to prices at time of writing.  Spigen Liquid Crystal Case  A cheap, slimline option  Colors: Crystal Clear | Material: TPU  Shows off your phone  Cheap  Minimal protection  Made of plastic  The Spigen Liquid Crystal case has a lot going for it, starting with the fact that it\u2019s very cheap, which is handy for anyone who\u2019s already stretched their budget buying the Pixel.  But despite its low price the Liquid Crystal is well-designed, with a slim and light form-fitting build, that maintains the shape of your handset, and being transparent it also maintains the Pixel\u2019s looks, so if you\u2019re a fan of the phone\u2019s unusual metal and glass design you won\u2019t have to hide it away.  It\u2019s not the most protective case around, but it\u2019s easy to put on, resists smudges and should keep your Pixel safe from minor scrapes and falls.  Spigen Rugged Armor Case  Serious protection at minimal cost  Colors: Black | Material: TPU  Durable  Carbon fiber accents  Only comes in black  Chunky  Another Spigen case, but this one has a little bit more going on. You lose the slim transparent design of the Liquid Crystal case, but in its place you get a case which has passed military grade drop tests (which apparently means being dropped 26 times from a height of 48 inches and surviving).  The Spigen Rugged Armor achieves this thanks to a spider web pattern and air cushioned corners on the inside of a TPU shell.  The case isn\u2019t much to look at, but textured carbon fiber accents mean it\u2019s more than just a nondescript black block.  Credit: Amazon  Caseology Parallax case  Stylish protection that doesn't add too much bulk  Colors: Black, Burgundy, Navy Blue | Material: TPU and PC  Lots of protection from every angle  Stylish for a low price  May be too bulky for some  Cases that offer lots of protection are usually bulky as all get out, but Caseology has basically mastered the art of doing the exact opposite. This dual-layer case protects the Google Pixel at every angle, even lifting the screen off a tablet to avoid micro scratches, and it looks good to boot.  This case's price has fallen since it debuted, meaning that it's now very affordable to pick up one of Caseology's Parallax cases in the color of your choice on the cheap.  Credit: VRS Design / Amazon  VRS Design High Pro Shield  A protective case for mobile media fans  Colors: Dark Silver, Really Blue, Satin Silver | Material: Polycarbonate and TPU  Lots of protection  Kickstand  Not slim  Made of plastic  The VRS Design High Pro Shield isn\u2019t the slimmest case around, but it\u2019s thinner than you might expect given the level of protection it provides.  The case is certified as offering military grade protection, so you can feel confident that your Pixel is safe, and while made of plastic the High Pro Shield sports a brushed metal effect that helps it stand out from the crowd.  Speaking of metal, there\u2019s also a metal kickstand built in, so you can prop your phone up when watching movies.  Credit: Tetded / Amazon  Tetded Cowhide Leather Case  Real leather with a slim design  Colors: Black | Material: Leather  Genuine leather  Slim  No card slots  Only comes in black  If only real leather will do, then check out the Tetded Cowhide Leather case. It\u2019s one of very few genuine leather Pixel cases at time of writing, and predictably you do pay a premium for it.  But the case undeniably looks good, with a slim profile that avoids adding too much bulk, and a microfiber lining to keep your screen protected when the case is closed.  Pixel Phone Case by Google  A colorful case that fits like a glove  Colors: Gray, Blue, Green, Peach, Coral | Material: Silicone, polycarbonate and microfiber  Lots of color choices  Good fit  Looks cheap  Fairly pricey  If you want a case that\u2019s guaranteed to be a good fit, then look no further than the Pixel Phone Case. This is created by the same team as the Pixel itself, so it fits like a glove.  It also comes in a range of colors to suit almost any style and provides three layers of protection, with a silicone exterior for shock absorption and grip, a polycarbonate core for support and a soft microfiber interior.  Incipio Carnaby Case  An unusual case that's comfortable to hold  Colors: Black, Gray, Olive | Material: TPU, polymer and cotton  Interesting design  Soft feel  Expensive  Mostly plastic  Making a case stand out, without making it look weird, can be a tricky job, but we\u2019d say the Incipio Carnaby succeeds, as on top of the fairly standard plastic shell there\u2019s a layer of cotton, which looks different (in a good way) and makes the case soft to the touch.  Available in three distinct shades, the Carnaby is also strong and shock absorbent, so as well as looking good it does the vital job of keeping your Pixel safe.  OtterBox Commuter  A strong case that protects from damage and dust  Colors: Black, Pink | Material: Polycarbonate and rubber  Drop protection  Keeps dirt and dust out  Bulky  Pricey  OtterBox is a big name in cases and for good reason, with its Commuter case providing serious levels of protection.  An inner rubber cover and outer polycarbonate shell provide two layers of protection, deflecting shocks away from your phone, while port covers keep dirt and dust out.  All of which sounds great on paper, but OtterBox has extensively trialled the case, over more than 238 hours and 24 tests, so you can be sure it lives up to the billing.  Artworks Live Case  Turns your phone into a work of art  Colors: Various | Material: Polycarbonate  Customizable  Unusual  Middling protection  Quite expensive  Most cases are quite plain, but the Artworks Live Case isn\u2019t most cases. As an official Google case you can be confident that it\u2019s well-built, but the real selling point is the ability to apply an artwork to it, for a truly eye-catching cover.  There\u2019s a fairly wide range of images available to choose from, and you can position your artwork of choice however you want on the case, for a unique, custom finish.  Photos Live Case  A case with unlimited options  Colors: Various | Material: Polycarbonate  Can make it your own  Slim fit  Not the most protective case  Could look tacky  If you want even more creative freedom than Google\u2019s Artwork cases offer, then check out the Photos Live Case. This is a similar idea, except you can upload one of your own photos as an image for the case, meaning the possibilities are endless and your Pixel can truly reflect you.  Or if you\u2019re lacking inspiration you could look at the Places Live Case, which lets you select a location from Google Maps, then pick from a range of styles and colors to print it in.", "stock": "GOOGL", "label": 1, "date": "2018-04-02", "source": "techradar", "url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/best-google-pixel-cases"}, {"article": "Google has announced it will be banning adverts for cryptocurrency across all its platforms.

When you now search for an image, you won\u2019t see the \u2018View image\u2019 button. This used to allow people to view just the image on its own, and allow them to download the image without visiting the site.  This caused concern from the people who created and published those images, as not only were their images viewed and downloaded without people having to visit the site, potentially robbing them of an audience, but it also meant the images were viewed out of context, and without any information on usage rights or who to credit if you re-use the image.  Getting those clicks  As the Google search team said on Twitter, while the View Image button is gone, the \u2018Visit\u2019 button remains, hopefully encouraging people to visit the website before downloading the image.  Today we're launching some changes on Google Images to help connect users and useful websites. This will include removing the View Image button. The Visit button remains, so users can see images in the context of the webpages they're on. pic.twitter.com/n76KUj4ioDFebruary 15, 2018  However, you can still right-click the image and select \u2018Open image in new tab\u2019 and download it that way. Still, it\u2019s hoped that this move will make people more aware of where their images come from.  As the Google search team explains, \u201cHaving a single button that takes people to actionable information about the image is good for users, web publishers and copyright holders\u201d, while also revealing that these changes have come about in part due to a settlement earlier this week with Getty Images.  Getty Images filed a competition law complaint against Google with the European Commission in 2016, which accused Google of \u201ccreating captivating galleries of high-resolution, copyrighted content. Because image consumption is immediate, once an image is displayed in high-resolution, large format, there is little impetus to view the image on the original source site.\u201d  Google and Getty Images have now embarked on a multiyear global licencing partnership to solve this issue.

Snap Ed Sheeran in the street, for example, and you get links to his YouTube and Facebook pages, and so on.

The new app, rolling out now for Android devices, is largely similar to Android Pay in terms of function but it has a slightly different layout. It\u2019s split into two sections: Home, which allows you to see all of your recent payments, any nearby stores and any rewards you can claim, and Cards, which is where you\u2019ll store and find all of your credit and debit cards, loyalty cards, offers, and gift cards.  At the moment, the app doesn\u2019t have Google Wallet\u2019s function which allows you to send and receive money, but this is apparently coming to the UK and US in just a few months.

The audiobooks will work on Android, iOS, Chromecast, as a web-based application and in any device with Google Assistant. That last one is particularly interesting, as Google\u2019s voice assistant is becoming fairly ubiquitous.  This means you\u2019ll be able to listen to your audiobooks on a vast array of first and third-party smart speakers like the Google Home range, plus Android Wear-powered wearables. It's also coming soon to Android Auto, so you can be entertained while driving, and the service will remember where you are in your novel so you can transition from one to the other without restarting the chapter.  Smarter speaking from your smart speaker  Google is putting the same level of computer learning that you\u2019ll find in its other features into the audiobooks service, allowing you to interact with your books so that rather than just \u2018Track 12\u2019 showing up on your dashboard's display, you\u2019ll get the chapter title, and with the Google Assistant interaction, you can ask for pertinent information about the book like the author\u2019s name.  Smart speakers are well known for their timers, and Google Play audiobooks takes full advantage of this, allowing you to set a countdown timer for when to stop reading, so if you want to delegate the reading of your child\u2019s bedtime story to your Google Home, you can. Although there\u2019s nothing to stop the little nipper from requesting more stories.  Talking of family, one of the things that sets Google\u2019s offering apart from Amazon\u2019s Audible is the family sharing feature. With Audible, you\u2019re able to share an audiobook with one other adult in your Amazon Household. With Google, you can share with up to five other people in your family.  The Google Home Max speaker  We asked Greg Hartrell, Google Books Product Manager, about Google's definition of family, if you had to be biologically related to them, he had this to say:  \u201cWe don't have an opinion on the various definitions of families. You set up a family account by going to Google Play, the head of the household puts on a payment instrument, and up to five people can get added to that family account. And since there are many definitions of a family, we hope that people use that experience to have their family enjoyed their audiobooks together.\u201d  So if your family happens to be your book club, that looks like it\u2019s all part of the plan. That\u2019s not the only differentiator, and the next is probably going to be the most appealing for those that aren\u2019t regular readers but want to dip their toe in to the world of audiobooks:  \u201cThis is an a la carte model with prices below list,\u201d continued Hartrell, \u201cmaking it affordable and easy to try, and there's no commitment meaning that you can listen to as many or as few as you want without a subscription.\u201d  Available titles in the US include Ready Player One ($6.99), Fire & Fury: Inside the Trump White House ($8.99), Murder on the Orient Express ($4.99), Lincoln in the Bardo ($8.99), 1984 ($5.99) and The Girl on the Train ($6.99).  Okay Google, why now?  It makes sense for Google to be getting into audiobooks now, with Google Assistant looking set to live within all sort of smart home devices, and as Hartrell puts it:  \u201cThe audio publishers association in America published a statistic that the sales of audiobooks have grown double digits year over year and that's growing faster than any other book format.\u201d  In the smart speaker market, Google managed to release the Home range long after Amazon\u2019s Echo range hit the shelves and still became a major competitor.

To start using Google Assistant in Hindi, you must have an Android Phone running Android 5.0 or later. The phone language must be set to English (India).

Sadly, October came and went with no such announcement. Sure, there are Chromebooks like the Pixelbook that can run Android apps through the Google Play store, but Andromeda, referred internally as Fuchsia at Google, runs deeper than that.  We\u2019re expecting Google Fuchsia to take over as Google\u2019s singular, united OS for phones, tablets and laptops.  Whether it supports the full-fat version of Google Docs, fully utilizing Google Drive or finding your favorite app on the Google Play Store, you\u2019ll be able to do whatever from whichever Google Fuchsia powered device you choose. Even better, you\u2019ll be able to pick up wherever you left off on any app from any other Fuchsia device.  For as excited as we are for Fuchsia, even after running early versions, we\u2019re still in the early days of Fuchsia \u2013 likely far out from seeing Google laptops and phones running on this OS. Until then, you can try it out for yourself if you have a spare bootable USB stick lying around.  Cut to the chase  What is it? An Android-meets-Chrome, multi-device operating system  An Android-meets-Chrome, multi-device operating system When is it out? An early form is available on the Google Pixelbook now  An early form is available on the Google Pixelbook now What will it cost? Likely nothing, as is with Android and Chrome  A Google Pixelbook running an early version of Fuchsia OS (Image Credit: Ars Technica)  What is Google Fuchsia?  Again, Google Fuchsia is a hybrid OS that is still very much in development. The entirety of Fuchsia OS is comprised of two distinct but connected user interfaces (UI): a phone-centric one codenamed \u2018Armadillo\u2019 and a traditional desktop UI known as \u2018Capybara\u2019 internally, according to 9to5Google .  So far, more is known about the mobile version of Fuchsia than the laptop one, but ArsTechnica was recently able to get Fuchsia running on a Google Pixelbook in an awfully early state. Furthermore, 13-year-old indie developer Noah Cain has since created a working version of Fuchsia\u2019s Capybara design, 9to5Google has more recently reported.  'Fuchsia is going to accomplish much of what Microsoft and Apple already have in Windows 10 and iOS-to-macOS Sierra Continuity, respectively, but in a very Google way.'  Dividing the OS up into two separate UI based on the hardware it\u2019s being used with is a classically Microsoft-inspired move. Windows 10 already scales depending on whether it\u2019s being used with a desktop computer, phone, tablet or game console. In fact, Windows 10\u2019s only unifier is its kernel, the root code that controls the bulk of the operating system.  In the case of Fuchsia, that kernel is known as \u2018Zircon\u2019, and it\u2019s designed to be consistently upgradeable in addition to being safe from applications accessing it constantly, adding an extra layer of security and eliminating situations in which apps are rendered incompatible with OS updates.  Whether it\u2019s in the mobile or desktop orientation, Fuchsia is laden with Google\u2019s Material design found all over its Android and Chrome OS products. Shadows are a big focus on the design aesthetic, using a new Vulkan-based graphics renderer known as \u2018Escher\u2019 to do the job. The result is an interface with more depth to its look than traditionally flat OS products.  Google Fuchsia as it appears on a smartphone device.  Fuchsia is also heavily focused on a cards-based interface, in which every app you open appears inside one of these cards \u2013 plus, you can place multiple apps into a single card. This orients the user around tasks at hand rather than apps. Those apps are expected to look the same across different devices because of a new cross-platform mobile app development framework, developed by Google, known as Flutter.  Beyond that, Google Fuchsia revolves around Google Assistant more deeply accessing and working with your apps and information to provide even more actions and insights. Google has referred to these apps and pieces of information as \u2018entities\u2019, according to a GitHub developer page, and they\u2019re all accessible by Google Assistant on Fuchsia. We\u2019ve even seen a recent demo that further illustrates how deeply ingrained Google Assistant is on Fuchsia.  Finally, Fuchsia wants to be the best cross-device OS to date. To achieve this, Fuchsia uses a new tool known as \u2018Ledger\u2019 by the GitHub community. Ledger, once you\u2019re signed into a Google Account on a Fuchsia device, will automatically save your place in all installed apps across all Fuchsia devices.  All in all, Fuchsia is Google\u2019s attempt to get the best of Chrome and Android into a single operating system that\u2019s more efficient both while you\u2019re using it and when you\u2019re away \u2013 not to mention in between those states or between devices.  This is likely where Fuchsia will make its debut.  Since August 2016, the Google Fuchsia release date has been rumored several times \u2013 only to turn out untrue. These rumors have generally cropped up before Google\u2019s big Google IO developer event in California or, in the case of last October, when we know a big hardware release is imminent.  In February 2018, it was revealed that Google\u2019s former head of Android platform security, Nick Kralevich, had left the Android team to \u201cdefine security\u201d over in the Fuchsia department. Describing it as a \u201cnew, experimental operating system,\u201d Kralevich doesn\u2019t hint at any specific launch window, however it does show where Google is choosing to put its most crucial resources.  This should help frame our expectations for when we should expect to see Fuchsia on shelf-ready devices: most likely not before 2019. However, that doesn\u2019t mean that Google Fuchsia will be absent in 2018, as Google may decide to preview it this year in preparation for a mainstream release in 2019.  At any rate, keep it locked to this page as we draw closer to a possible release date and therefore might have some new information for you.  Is Fuchsia the end of Android as we know it? (Image: \u00a9 GE)  What could Fuchsia mean for Android and Chrome \u2013 and Windows and macOS?  From what we're hearing, Fuchsia seems to be Google's response to Microsoft and Apple's united platforms with one of its own. In turning Android into one of the two biggest smartphone platforms and later popularizing Chrome OS \u2013 and its extensible web-based productivity programs \u2013 in the classroom and workplace, Google itself has become a major player on all platforms.  Again, from the sound of it, Fuchsia is going to accomplish much of what Microsoft and Apple already have in Windows 10 and iOS-to- macOS Sierra Continuity, respectively, but in a very Google way. It's easy to expect access to Google's inimitable search and data-tracking at your fingertips \u2013 Google Assistant and \u2018entities\u2019, anyone? \u2013 which it would tout as better than Microsoft and Apple's, and an interface that changes based on the device from which it's accessed.  Will this eventually mean the end of Android and Chrome? In name, most likely, but their principles will almost certainly live on \u2013 there's too much solid foundation not to build on top of them. Just look at the Material design language found throughout these early builds of either version of Fuchsia.  The end result, likely to be seen in a preview form later this year and in purchasable devices in 2019, will be just one platform for Google to worry about. With Fuchsia, Google will be able to push new updates and features to all versions at once, simplifying support as well as user understanding.  With that, Google will become that much more formidable a foe to Microsoft and Apple, and that much appealing an option to Android and Chromebook users all over. Who knows, perhaps it will be enough to bring people over from the other side of Microsoft and Apple\u2019s fences.

But like most flagship phones, they don\u2019t come cheap: starting at $649 (\u00a3629, AU$1,079) for the smaller Pixel 2 and $849 (\u00a3799, AU$1,399) out-of-pocket for the Pixel 2 XL.  As such, it\u2019s wise to find some protection for your investment. Most enthusiasts don\u2019t want to cover up the lush design of their phone, and we totally understand why, but the last thing you want is to send it away for repair.  Below, you\u2019ll find several case recommendations that cover a wide range of budgets and style preferences. While we\u2019ve personally used most of the following cases, some of these options are untested. Nevertheless, we\u2019re confident that each entry is a cut above the rest due to their value and design.  Image 1 of 4 A paper-thin case Image 2 of 4 Fits the Pixel 2 like a glove Image 3 of 4 Peel's case leaves buttons and curved glass exposed Image 4 of 4 You can barely tell it's there  Super Thin Case from Peel  If you\u2019re reluctant to cover up the slim design of the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL, you won\u2019t find a case that\u2019s more trim and thin than Peel\u2019s. It snaps right onto the phone and hugs its curves without adding extra bulk.  Due to this case\u2019s ultra-skinny profile, it\u2019s not a case that you want to put through much turmoil. It prevents micro-scratches, but it likely won\u2019t prevent damage from a drop, and in the case of the Pixel 2 XL, its curved glass isn\u2019t protected in the slightest.  All said, Peel\u2019s cases make an excellent impression on design geeks, and so long as you\u2019re cool with its flimsiness, you won\u2019t find a case that better accentuates the Pixel 2\u2019s look.  Check out the case right here: (Pixel 2) (Pixel 2 XL)  Incipio Multi Stripes case  It's surprisingly hard to find a Pixel 2 case that adds some wild flair, but Incipio's fits the bill, but for more than just being vibrant.  At its affordable asking price, it cradles Google's phone real close \u2013 even providing a lip over the screen to prevent scratches or cracks from accidentally sliding it on the table face-first.  Let's be honest, the best thing about this case is that it just looks nice. Most of us here consider the Pixel 2 to be a good-looking phone, but if you've got to protect it, you might as well add some style.  Image 1 of 4 This case doesn't add much bulk Image 2 of 4 It matches the look of the Pixel 2 nicely Image 3 of 4 The buttons preserve their 'click' through the case Image 4 of 4 The case raises above the glass to protect the screen  Fabric Phone Case from Google  Google\u2019s own case for Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL does well at maintaining the slim look and feel of the phones. Unlike the other options on this list, this one adds microfiber material to the list, giving it a classy look that enhances the grippiness in hand.  We like this case for several reasons. Its price is tolerable, it\u2019s available in a few different colors (Carbon is pictured, but Cement, Midnight and Coral are for sale) and it makes all of the Pixel 2\u2019s features easily accessible. The buttons are effortless to push, making it feel like there\u2019s no case on at all. It also raises the phone\u2019s front so that the glass display isn\u2019t grazing any surfaces.  The only downside in our experience is that fuzz from your pocket gets into the grooves near the screen. Simply wiping it away cleans things up, but it\u2019s annoying to have to do that each and every time you pull it out. Also, the bottom of the phone near the charging port isn\u2019t protected on the front, which subjects it to scratching.  This one's currently available on Amazon in a few different color varieties, but if you can't find it, head to the links below.  Image 1 of 4 See the cases's two layers? Image 2 of 4 Image 3 of 4 Makes the buttons nice and clicky Image 4 of 4 Protects the phone from all corners while maintaining a low profile  Live Case from Google  It should be no surprise that Google\u2019s cases don\u2019t fuss with their phones\u2019 design too much. The Live Case is a more durable option over the Fabric Case, giving it two levels of protection. To pop it on, there\u2019s a silicon case that\u2019s protected by a tough shell that has the design of your choice on it.  Every angle of the Pixel 2 is protected here, including the camera and screen. The buttons feel nice to press and better yet, the Live Case functionality is interesting. Your phone's wallpaper can match the look of the case by downloading the Live Case app and putting in the code that's printed on its inside.  Removing and reapplying the Live Case takes a bit of practice, though we never felt like it was close to breaking. All in all, this case is best if making something custom is a high-priority for you.  You should be able to find a nice variety of pre-designed Live Cases on discount through Amazon, but should you want to customize, head to the links below.  Image 1 of 4 This case has quite the bumper Image 2 of 4 You'll encounter a bit of bulk here Image 3 of 4 The buttons feel a bit stiff under the protective layer Image 4 of 4 This case adds bezels to an otherwise bezel-lite phone  Evo Check Case from Tech21  While not the most rugged case in its design, the Evo Check case by Tech21 is taking us into options that add a fair amount of bulk to the Pixel 2.  This case fits the Pixel 2 snugly, adding on the company\u2019s FlexShock barrier to make it drop-friendly from distances up to 10 feet. Overall, it strikes a nice balance between form and function, showing off the Pixel 2\u2019s design highlights while making sure to protect it from all sides.  Google\u2019s cases on this list provide better button feedback. Here, the phone\u2019s buttons felt a little too difficult to push in, though it\u2019s possible that they might loosen up over time. But we\u2019re a fan of this case\u2019s added grip factor and the mesh design.  They're also available from the Tech21 site: Pixel 2 | Pixel 2 XL  Image 1 of 4 This case looks low profile without the Pixel 2 inside Image 2 of 4 But the phone looks fossilized in amber once popped in Image 3 of 4 The buttons are a little too tough to press, but still functional Image 4 of 4 A smaller, slightly less protective barrier than Tech21's case  Presidio Clear Case from Speck  This clear case from Speck is durable, yet simplistic in design \u2013 an impressive feat given how robust of a protector it is. If you\u2019re after a rugged case that has hints of a slimline look and feel, this is one to look out for.  Once the Pixel 2 is slid into the Presidio Clear, it\u2019s protected from dropping from up to eight feet. Sure, it\u2019s less than the 10 feet guaranteed by Tech21\u2019s option, but Speck\u2019s case shows off the design of the phone a bit better.  Some complain that this case makes holding the phone a more slippery affair, however, we haven't noticed this yet in our testing. This sort of thing certainly depends on how oily the case becomes, either through body oils or from touching it after eating.  Incipio Reprieve Sport 2.0 case  The low-profile build of a slimline case combined with a textured rim and bumper-packed corners describes the look and feel of the Incipio Reprieve Sport 2.0.  It's not the cheapest case around, but unlike slimmer options, this one will offer protection from every angle without masking the Pixel 2's look.  We always appreciate when a rugged case yields responsive buttons and easy access to ports, and to that end, this one is worth checking out in your favorite color.  Bellroy Leather case  Google has partnered up with Bellroy as one of its premium 'Made for Google' providers, and the fruits are stunning.  The Bellroy Leather case comes in a variety of color options for both the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL, and doesn't really cost as much you might think.  The leather on its back is supple and smooth, transitioning into matte plastic running around the trim of your device. Bellroy's case doesn't provide button extenders, but pushing them in doesn't require any additional effort.  This case gives off a really high-end look and those looking to suit the Pixel 2 up as nice as you dress yourself, you'll be pleased with Bellroy's latest.  Kerf wood case  There's something that your Pixel 2 or Pixel 2 XL is missing. It's wood, yep wood. Kerf makes its own phone cases by hand, complete with a flattering design, and backs it with a lifetime warranty.  Not just any regular wooden case would impress us, but this one \u2013 even at the low-end $69 walnut option \u2013 is a top option if you want to protect your Pixel 2.  The buttons are responsive, the suede inside cradles the form factor perfectly and heck, it just smells good.

Not only is it beefing up its phones with \"neural engine\" chips to power AI efforts like augmented reality and machine learning, it's also building out its Siri team. The company recently listed 161 open positions and hired Carnegie Mellon's Russ Salakhutdinov last year to head up AI research. Earlier this week, Apple confirmed perhaps its most important hire yet in the space: former Google AI chief, John Giannandrea.  According to Apple, Giannandrea will head up Apple's \"machine learning and AI strategy\" and report directly to CEO Tim Cook. Seeing as Giannandrea was responsible for making AI central to Google's overall strategy, his new role as Apple's AI lead seems to indicate Siri might be getting a serious makeover. And maybe, just maybe, Siri might just learn a few of the following Google Assistant tricks in the process.  Better search  When it comes to search, it'll be difficult for Apple's Siri to really go head-to-head against Google Assistant, simply because Google is the king of search. But there are other ways that Siri could become smarter here. Even though Siri has contextual search -- the ability to answer follow-up questions -- it's wildly inconsistent.  For example, when I asked Siri \"Who is the president of the United States?\" and then followed it up with \"Who is his wife?\" it sometimes misunderstood or misheard me, giving me definitions of the word \"wife\" instead. (It did respond with \"Melania Trump\" once, but only once). When I asked the same question to Google Assistant, it was completely flawless, even offering me a list of Trump's former wives. When I asked more follow-up questions like her age or her height, Google was much more accurate here as well.  Sometimes Siri doesn't give direct answers at all. When I ask Siri \"what sound does a dog make?\" it brings up a list of search results. But when I ask Google the same question, it literally plays an audio file of a dog barking. Sure, I don't expect Siri to answer complicated questions, but it should at least know the answers to basic kindergarten-level queries without bringing up basic search results. Since Giannandrea has experience in both voice-recognition and search, he might be able to influence improvements in this area.  Siri could also stand to improve the overall search experience. Right now, if you ask a question, you'll either get a single page or a list of results. Google presents a list of related answers in a menu underneath, just in case you want to know more about a topic.  Another area that Siri can learn from Google Assistant is simply a better understanding of who you are and have that inform search results. For example, if I tell Google that my favorite team is the San Francisco Giants, it'll simply return the scores of last night's game if I say \"how are the Giants doing?\" or just \"how did my favorite team do last night?\" Siri, on the other hand, would ask me \"Do you mean the New York Giants or the San Francisco Giants?\" every single time. That's just tiresome.  Smart-home integration  Perhaps one of the smartest moves Google has made in recent years is to make its assistant central to its overall hardware strategy. It's not only in phones; it's also in a variety of smart speakers and most of the Nest lineup. This kind of wide cross-platform and cross-disciplinary approach is what Giannandrea was known for, and he could very well implement the same philosophy to Apple as well.  One area that certainly needs a lot of help is how Siri works in the latest Apple HomePod. Sure, it has great audio quality, and it works well with some HomeKit compatible products like the Phillps Hue lights, but its functionality just doesn't compare with Amazon's Echo or Google's Home.  Siri on the HomePod can't even handle multiple timers or, shockingly enough, initiate phone calls. It also doesn't play well with a few key third-party apps -- it can't order an Uber or a Lyft, and it doesn't work with any other streaming music service except for Apple Music. Yes, Siri does work with some apps like WhatsApp, WeChat and Evernote but the list of third-party apps is pretty small compared to its rivals.  Also, Google's Home can recognize people by their voice, Siri on HomePod can't. That means that any ol' stranger can come up to your speaker and access your iMessages unless you set up a restriction beforehand. Seeing as Siri on the iPhone is able to discern voices pretty well, it's surprising that this function was not carried over to the HomePod.  Third-party support  Last but not least is third-party support. Apple traditionally has a walled garden philosophy when it comes to a lot of its products, as you can tell from the HomePod and Apple Music example above. But it might have to eventually let it go. One of the most frustrating things with Siri on the iPhone is that it seems pretty stunted if you use anything that's not Apple. If you ask it to play a certain song on Spotify, it'll just launch the app without playing anything. If you ask it for directions on Google Maps, the app will open, but you're on your own from there.  Though Google does favor its own apps for some things -- it'll automatically play podcasts from Google Play, for example -- it's at least better with third-party integration than Apple.  Still, it doesn't mean Siri is worse than Google Assistant at everything. As we discovered in our week with Google Assistant, Siri seemed better at pronouncing names and was a little better in the back-and-forth sass department. It was also really good at recognizing voices on mobile -- not just anybody can activate your phone with \"Hey Siri,\" only you can (We should note that Google Assistant can do this too). Plus, since Siri is already baked into your iPhone, it's by far the easiest voice assistant to use if you have an iOS device.  While it's still early days yet in Giannandrea's Apple tenure, if he even takes a few of the lessons he learned from Google and brings them to Apple, it will be an improvement.

Photo: Richard B. Levine/Zuma Press  One problem the brilliant minds at Google have yet to solve: How to beat Amazon.com AMZN -1.22% at its own game.  It isn\u2019t for a lack of trying. Over the last couple of years, the internet search giant has aggressively built up its own cloud-computing business and pumped out its own line of smart speaker products\u2014two relatively new businesses that have been wildly successful for Amazon. And that hasn\u2019t been without some success on Google\u2019s part. Its cloud-computing arm is now generating more than $1 billion in revenue every quarter. And its Home line of smart speakers now has about 31% of the U.S. market, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners.  But investors are lukewarm on Google at best. Such was evident on Friday, when the shares of parent company Alphabet Inc. GOOGL -0.12% slid 5% in the wake of its fourth-quarter results, though that only wiped out gains made since the first of the year. By contrast, Amazon\u2019s own results helped its stock defy the market\u2019s brutal selloff to gain nearly 3% for the day\u2014having already run up 17% for the year. For Alphabet, the main issue for investors is the rising costs that Google has to pay partners to direct traffic to its sites. Those traffic acquisition costs totaled $21.6 billion in 2017\u2014up 29% from the previous year. That outpaced the 20% revenue growth for Google\u2019s core advertising business for the year, which weighs on the company\u2019s profitability. Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat noted that the growth rate of these costs should start to moderate early this year. But profitability isn\u2019t why investors favor the retailer over the search engine. Google\u2019s $26.1 billion of operating income last year is about 40% more than Amazon has earned in its entire existence. Nor is it the propensity to make big gambles. The difference is that Amazon has figured out how to make more of its big gambles, such as Prime and its AWS cloud service, drive its accelerating growth. Since 2010, Amazon\u2019s larger revenue base has averaged 28% growth annually while Alphabet\u2019s has averaged 21%. In textbook investing, profits matter over revenue growth, but that doesn\u2019t always hold in tech. Investors won\u2019t return to Google just because it is so profitable. Instead, the company can emphasize successful new businesses like the cloud and better articulate how its ubiquitous Android mobile operating system contributes to growth. If it can do that while keeping its wildly profitable core business clicking, Google can catch up to its rival. Amazon wants to deliver everything you want to your doorstep, anywhere in the world.

The time for doubt is over. Last week\u2019s news that Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, is in talks to build a tech hub in the kingdom is only the latest sign. Look for more such initiatives when the crown prince visits the U.S. in early March.  Whatever one may think about Saudi Arabia or its new young strongman, there is no longer any dispute as to his resolve. Prince Mohammed is determined not just to reform the country but to wrench Saudis out of a 30-year torpor that he rightly sees as inexorably leading them toward poverty and instability. The radical change he is imposing isn\u2019t a choice: It is the only choice.  He has inherited a nation of 22 million spoiled children, each of whom wants a cushy life in the national nursery that oil-rich Saudi Arabia used to be. But with crude oil crashing to $26 a barrel in 2016\u2014and even now at almost $70 a barrel\u2014Riyadh can no longer afford the pacifiers to tranquilize its population, not to mention the 10 million foreign workers who have tended to Saudi citizens\u2019 every need.  Prince Mohammed\u2019s Saudi Vision 2030 is a push away from dependence on government and toward self-reliance. To jump-start the transformation, he has instituted social changes no one could have imagined only a few years ago: Saudis are now free to attend concerts and cinemas, and in June women will be driving, all of which were previously forbidden by religious authorities backed by royal rulers.  More significantly, Prince Mohammed has rounded up prominent people accused of financial corruption\u2014royal cousins, cabinet ministers, businessmen\u2014and forced them to turn over what the government says will be $106 billion in exchange for their freedom.  These are shocking tactics in a country accustomed to royal rule through laborious consensus-building among the senior princes. But the truth is that most of these senior princes are now dead. More to the point, that unwieldy method of governance failed for 30 years to wean the country off oil dependence, despite repeated commitments to that end. Prince Mohammed knows the folly of doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result.  Almost since the founding of modern Saudi Arabia in 1932, its stability has rested on three pillars: unity among the royals, their symbiotic cooperation with the Wahhabi religious establishment, and oil wealth. The new crown prince has upended each of these pillars\u2014arresting and humiliating his royal relatives, insisting on moderate Islam and a more open society, and imposing high taxes on the cheap oil that Saudis regard as their birthright.  During my January visit, Saudis were in shock at the social, political and economic changes. In a single week last month, electricity prices tripled, gasoline prices doubled (to roughly $2 a gallon), and the first-ever value added tax, of 5%, was imposed. If asked Ronald Reagan\u2019s famous 1980 debate question\u2014\u201cAre you better off than four years ago?\u201d\u2014almost all Saudis over 30 would say \u201cno.\u201d  The arrests of elite princes and businessmen, as well as conservative religious sheikhs, have chilled older Saudis. During my visit, more than one old acquaintance declined to meet me for \u201chealth\u201d reasons and other polite excuses. But Prince Mohammed\u2019s constituency is not the royal family or the religious sheikhs. It\u2019s the 70% of Saudis who are under 30. He essentially is playing generational Robin Hood\u2014taking from the elite who for decades helped themselves to the nation\u2019s oil revenues, while freeing the young from the smothering hand of Wahhabi sheikhs who sapped Saudi initiative by controlling every aspect of daily life. The crown prince clearly hopes that if citizens are allowed to manage their lives, they will take responsibility for their livelihoods.  This is a brave gamble, but without significant change Saudi Arabia\u2019s future looks dark. The economy is growing more slowly than the population. Domestic oil consumption is rising nearly 6% a year, a trend that would leave Saudis consuming all the Kingdom\u2019s oil production\u2014with none left for export\u2014by 2030. The economy shrank 0.5% last year and is estimated to grow only 1.6% in 2018, according to the International Monetary Fund, though the Saudi government projects faster growth of 2.7%. The official unemployment figure is 12.7% nationally, but it\u2019s nearly double that for men between 20 and 29 and 33% for young women in that age group.  Prince Mohammad\u2019s economic transformation represents a huge task. If that isn\u2019t enough, he also confronts a hegemonic and meddling Iran, a feud with Qatar, and a war in Yemen. Knowing the price Saudi Arabia has paid for decades of dithering, the crown prince has dared to impose rapid top-down change. Inevitably he will make some mistakes. Those he can repair. More troublesome is that some Westerners whose investment and support he seeks may insist on seeing Saudi Arabia as stuck like a fossil in its past Wahhabism and limited personal freedoms. While the Saudis are far from perfect on human rights, the West should acknowledge that the recent progress is real.  The biggest risk remains the economy: It is far from clear that Prince Mohammed can transform the country fast enough to meet the pent-up ambitions of young Saudis. The West has a stake in doing what it can to assure his success. A collapse that turns Saudi Arabia into another chaotic Iraq or theocratic Iran would be a disaster for the region and the world. Right now, the young prince with his agenda for radical change is Saudi Arabia\u2019s best, and probably only, shot at moderate\u2014and modernizing\u2014reform.

The policy also will restrict ads for nontraditional methods of wagering on the future movements of stock prices and foreign-exchange, such as binary options and financial spread-betting, Google said.  Facebook updated its ad policy to ban ads for similar financial products on Jan. 30.  The rise in popularity and price of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies has led to scammers using online ads to promote fraudulent cryptocurrency schemes via online ads. One new tool in the scammer\u2019s arsenal is so-called crypto-jacking, or putting lines of code in websites or ads to surreptitiously harness the computing power of the web surfers who look at them. The power is used to mine cryptocurrency, a digital form of money that has no government or central-bank printing it or standing behind it. Google said last year it removed more than 130 million ads that were used by hackers to mine for cryptocurrency. That is a very small percentage of the ads run on Google\u2019s ad network. The company\u2019s director of sustainable ads, Scott Spencer, declined to comment on how much potential ad revenue the company would be turning away by enacting the new policy, saying the decision was made to prevent consumer harm. The company has long banned ads promoting counterfeit goods or dangerous products, such as weapons or recreational drugs. Financial regulators are taking a close look at the multibillion-dollar U.S. market for raising funds in cryptocurrencies, raising questions about how these assets may be regulated in the future. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission warned earlier this month that cryptocurrency exchanges risk being deemed illegal because they don\u2019t disclose how they determine what currencies can be bought and sold on their sites. In addition to its cryptocurrency ad-policy announcement, Google said in a blog post published Wednesday that it took down more than 3.2 billion ads that violated its wider policies in 2017, such as those that attempted to send people to sites loaded with malware or phishing scams. The company said it removed 1.7 billion bad ads in 2016. Some bad ads did get through its defenses\u2014which comprise a combination of technology and thousands of human content reviewers\u2014but Mr. Spencer said those that slipped through the net can be measured in the hundreds, as opposed to the billions. Overall, Google said it removed 320,000 publishers from its ad network for violating its various publisher policies in 2017, while about 90,000 websites and 700,000 mobile apps were blacklisted.

Google executives were among the most influential voices on its committees and helped steer its decision making to favor its own ad formats, the people said.  Google began conducting research on what types of ads consumers found most annoying in 2015. The following year, Google executive Scott Spencer met with advertising and publishing executives to gather support for a new initiative that would essentially curb the role played by ad blockers, according to people who were present.  In the meetings, Mr. Spencer proposed blacklisting certain types of ads, the people said. The ad standards could be voluntarily adopted by industry groups, or even enforced by browsers or ad-blocking software, he said. Executives were asked to sign nondisclosure agreements barring them from discussing the meetings.  Venable LLC, a Washington-based law firm, was hired by three ad trade groups including Interactive Advertising Bureau to set up and manage the coalition, said the firm\u2019s chairman Stuart Ingis.  Soon after the coalition was established, it voted to adopt Google\u2019s research, Mr. Ingis said. Google had surveyed consumers on dozens of ad formats and ranked them by how \u201cannoying\u201d they found each one. Long, skinny rectangles on the side of the screen were found the least annoying; full-screen messages with countdown timers were among the most annoying.  The coalition worked with Google to improve the research, including deciding on a number of additional ad formats to test, said one person involved in the process. Google tested 55 desktop ad formats and 49 mobile formats and presented the findings to the group.  The coalition ultimately deemed 12 ad formats unacceptable.  Google\u2019s leading role in the standard-setting process troubled some of the coalition\u2019s members, who observed that the blacklisted ad formats generally don\u2019t apply to Google\u2019s own business, according to people who were part of the process. Google generates most of its revenue from text search ads and rectangular display ads, rather than the visually rich media ads that will be banned by the coalition.  \u201cThey are creating a standard that doesn\u2019t apply to them,\u201d said Ryan McConville, president of mobile-ad startup Kargo, one of 17 members on the coalition\u2019s board.  Some of the members lobbied the coalition to make exceptions, including Facebook, which argued that the social network should be excluded from a rule banning videos that automatically play with sound. Bounce Exchange Inc., a pop-up ad maker, argued the pop-up ad rule should be changed to exclude ads that appear when a user is idle for more than 30 seconds. Both efforts were successful.  Google didn\u2019t test one of its own most prominent ad formats, the ads that run on YouTube videos for several seconds before users can skip them.  The Google spokeswoman said the coalition plans to test video ads in the future. Some of Google\u2019s own ads are likely to be blocked by Chrome since non-compliant sites will have all ads blocked, she added.  Mr. Spencer said Google has given ample warning to the affected publishers. He said that less than 1% of the web\u2019s most visited sites\u2014under 1,000 of them\u2014are currently out of compliance with the rules.  \u200bGoogle handles 90% of the world's internet searches, and it increasingly is promoting a single answer for many questions. Even subjective or unanswerable queries sometimes get seemingly definitive answers. Here's how the algorithms are -- and aren't -- working.

We\u2019re back after taking a short break over the Easter weekend. The Villanova Wildcats stormed to victory against the Michigan Wolverines to win their second college basketball championship in three seasons Monday night. TBS\u2019s ad sales team was probably celebrating, too. The average cost for a 30-second spot during the game ranged between $1.4 million and $1.7 million, a 3% jump over last year, according to media-research firm SQAD.  Plenty of popcorn-grabbing moments over the past few days as our tech overlords took potshots at each other. Apple CEO Tim Cook threw some barbs in Facebook\u2019s direction last week during a taping of an MSNBC interview with Recode\u2019s Kara Swisher slated to air April 6. Mr. Cook called for more privacy regulation and said he\u2019d never be in the same situation Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is currently in because Apple\u2019s business model relies on the sale of devices and services users, rather than essentially selling users to advertisers. Mr. Zuckerberg fired back in a must-read interview with Vox\u2019s Ezra Klein, saying Mr Cook\u2019s comments were \u201cextremely glib and not at all aligned with the truth.\u201d The killer quote: \u201cIt\u2019s important that we don\u2019t all get Stockholm syndrome and let the companies that work hard to charge you more convince you that they actually care more about you.\u201d Sharing\u2019s caring!  \u2014Chickity Check Yo Self Before You Wreck Yo Self\u2014  You\u2019ll remember Facebook last week said it was curbing the information it exchanges with data brokers and shutting down its \u201cPartner Categories\u201d ad targeting tool. Now changes are coming to Custom Audiences, where marketers upload their own customer data lists in order to target them with ads across Facebook\u2019s platform. TechCrunch reported Facebook is building a more prominent permission tool for advertisers to certify they have permission to use the data they\u2019re uploading and that it\u2019ll prevent the sharing of Custom Audiences data between different Business Manager accounts. Facebook\u2019s policies always stated that advertisers should have consent for the data they\u2019re uploading, but by making those terms more obvious it\u2019s hoping to prevent the kind of illicit data sharing we saw in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. And, like everyone else, Facebook\u2019s also preparing for the EU\u2019s new General Data Protection Regulation that goes into effect in May. Meanwhile, in a similar vein, Facebook-owned Instagram has suddenly limited how much data some developers can collect from its API, Recode reported.  The Magic Number  Google-owner Alphabet reports its quarterly earnings on April 23, but this time it\u2019s different, Bloomberg reports. Google has long tracked the amount of money it makes from ads using \u201ccost-per-click,\u201d a metric that\u2019s closely watched by analysts. That makes a lot more sense on search than on the network of third-party sites it sells ads across because most advertisers tend to buy display and video ads based on impressions rather than clicks. So, in Q1, Alphabet will report on percentage changes in impressions and cost-per-impressions metrics for its Network business. Speaking of impressions, YouTube is launching a new \u201cTrueView\u201d ad product that advertisers will pay for on an impression (CPM) basis, even if users skip at the five-second mark, Ad Age reports. What\u2019s the sell here? The blog post announcing \u201cTrueView for Reach\u201d suggests that brands that are good at getting their message across in just a few seconds can potentially reach more people and drive down their CPMs.  Laura, Can\u2019t You Give Me Some Time  Fox News has responded to advertisers\u2019 withdrawals from \u201cThe Ingraham Angle\u201d over a tweet by the show\u2019s host, Laura Ingraham, that mocked Parkland shooting survivor David Hogg. Ms. Ingraham, who apologized, is now off on a scheduled vacation and due to return next Monday, according to Fox News Co-President Jack Abernethy. Mr. Abernethy said in a statement, \u201cWe cannot allow voices to be censored by agenda-driven intimidation efforts,\u201d reports the Los Angeles Times. As the Wrap reported, \u201cThe Ingraham Angle\u201d had just 7 minutes of paid commercial time on Friday, down from an average of 14 minutes 33 seconds between January 1 and March 28, according to data from Kantar Media. The show lost five of its top 20 advertisers: Bayer, Hulu, Johnson & Johnson, Liberty Mutual and Wayfair. What\u2019s not clear is whether the network is taking a financial hit or whether advertisers have simply shifted to other Fox News shows. A source told Variety that Fox News is accommodating sponsors who want to move their ads elsewhere in the schedule. (Reminder: Fox News parent 21st Century Fox and Wall Street Journal parent News Corp share common ownership.)  Sumnertime Blues  CBS and Viacom are advancing in their merger talks. So who will have the final say on whether to do a deal? Sumner Redstone, the 94-year-old mogul whose health has declined so badly that he can\u2019t speak much beyond grunts, is still the most powerful figure, in theory \u2014 with an 80% voting interest in National Amusements, the holding company that itself owns nearly 80% voting stakes in Viacom and CBS. But WSJ\u2019s Keach Hagey has new details on the current chain of command: National Amusements updated its bylaws in 2016 to make clear that Mr. Redstone had a single vote among seven NAI directors in decisions tied to the Viacom and CBS stakes. That move, meant to clarify procedures partly due to questions about Mr. Redstone\u2019s mental capacity, hasn\u2019t previously been disclosed. Mr. Redstone\u2019s holding still gives him the power to replace NAI board members. A decision on whether to combine Viacom and CBS could come as soon as this month. And as Reuters first reported, CBS is close to making an all-stock offer that values Viacom below its current stock price.  Best of the rest  21st Century Fox said Tuesday it could sell British TV channel Sky News to Disney in order to ease the passage of its bid to acquire the 61% of Sky it does not already own. Its other proposed remedy is to establish Sky News as a separate company within the bigger Sky group, with an independent board and a 15-year funding guarantee.

The monopolies of old and of today were built on proprietary technology and physical networks that drove down costs while locking in customers, erecting formidable barriers to entry. Just as Standard Oil and AT&T were once critical to the nation\u2019s economic infrastructure, today\u2019s tech giants are gatekeepers to the internet economy. If they\u2019re imposing a cost, it may not be what customers pay but the products they never see.  In its youth Standard Oil was as revered for its technological and commercial brilliance as any big tech company today. John D. Rockefeller began with a single refinery in Cleveland in 1863 and over the next few decades acquired other, weaker refineries. Those that wouldn\u2019t sell, he underpriced and drove out of business. By 1904, companies controlled by Standard Oil produced 87% of refined oil output, according to Mike Scherer, a retired Harvard economist who has written extensively on antitrust.  This wasn\u2019t superficially bad for consumers. The price of kerosene, the principal refined product from oil, fell steadily as Standard Oil\u2019s market share expanded, thanks to falling crude oil prices and Standard Oil\u2019s economies of scale, bargaining power with suppliers such as railroads, and innovation, such as the Frasch-Burton process for deriving kerosene from high-sulfur oil in Ohio.  Standard Oil's refinery in Richmond, Calif., in 1911. Photo: Library of Congress/Corbis/VCG/Getty Images  When the federal government sued to break up Standard Oil, the Supreme Court acknowledged business acumen was important to the company\u2019s early success, but concluded that was eventually supplanted by a single-minded determination to drive others out of the market.  In a 2005 paper, Mr. Scherer found that Standard Oil was indeed a prolific generator of patents in its early years, but that slowed once it achieved dominance. Around 1909 Standard\u2019s Indiana unit invented \u201cthermal cracking\u201d to improve gasoline refining to meet nascent demand from automobiles, but the company\u2019s head office thought the technology too dangerous and refused to commercialize it. After the Indiana unit was spun off when the company was broken up in 1911, it commercialized the technology to enormous success, Mr. Scherer wrote.  Big Spenders Top tech companies owe their market position in part to heavy investment in new products and technology. R&D spending as a share of revenue Intel 21.5% Facebook 21.2% Alphabet  15.5%  Microsoft  13.8%  Johnson & Johnson  12.5%  Amazon*  11.8%  Apple  5.1%  General Motors  4.9%  General Electric  4.0%  Procter & Gamble  2.9%  AT&T  1.0%  Exxon Mobil  0.5%  The story of AT&T is similar. It owed its early growth and dominant market position to Alexander Graham Bell\u2019s 1876 patent for the telephone. After the related patents expired in the 1890s, new exchanges sprung up in countless cities to compete.  Competition was a powerful prod to innovation: Independent companies, by installing twisted copper lines and automatic switching, forced AT&T to do the same. But AT&T, like today\u2019s tech giants, had \u201cnetwork effects\u201d on its side.  \u201cJust like people joined Facebook because everyone else was on Facebook, the biggest competitive advantage AT&T had was that it was interconnected,\u201d says Milton Mueller, a professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology who has studied the history of technology policy.  Early in the 20th century, AT&T began buying up local competitors and refusing to connect independent exchanges to its long-distance lines, arousing antitrust complaints. By the 1920s, it was allowed to become a monopoly in exchange for universal service in the communities it served. By 1939, the company carried more than 90% of calls.  Though AT&T\u2019s research unit, Bell Labs, became synonymous with groundbreaking discoveries, in telephone innovation AT&T was a laggard. To protect its own lucrative equipment business it prohibited innovative devices such as the Hush-a-Phone, which kept others from overhearing calls, and the Carterphone, which patched calls over radio airwaves, from connecting to its network.  After AT&T was broken up into separate local and long-distance companies in 1982, telecommunication innovation blossomed, spreading to digital switching, fiber optics, cellphones\u2014and the internet.  Just as AT&T decided what equipment could be used on the nation\u2019s telephone systems, Google\u2019s search algorithms determine who can be found on the internet. If you searched for a toaster online in the mid 2000s, Google would probably have taken you to comparison shopping sites such as Nextag. They pioneered features such as showing consumer ratings in search results, how popular a product was and how prices had changed over time, recalls Gary Reback, an antitrust lawyer who represented several competitors against Google.  Google\u2019s Eric Schmidt testifying at a Senate Judiciary Committee antitrust hearing in September 2011. Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images  But when Google launched its own comparison business, Google Shopping, those sites found themselves dropping deeper into Google\u2019s search results. They accused Google of changing its algorithm to favor its own results. The company responded that its algorithm was designed to give customers the results they want. \u201cIf consumers don\u2019t like the answer that Google Search provides, they can switch to another search engine with just one click,\u201d Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt told Congress in 2011.  At that same hearing Jeffrey Katz, then the chief executive of Nextag, responded, \u201cThat is like saying move to Panama if you don\u2019t like the tax rate in America. It\u2019s a fake choice because no one has Google\u2019s scope or capabilities and consumers won\u2019t, don\u2019t, and in fact can\u2019t jump.\u201d  In 2013 the U.S. Federal Trade Commission concluded that even if Google had hurt competitors, it was to serve consumers better, and declined to bring a case. Since then, comparison sites such as Nextag have largely faded.  Last year the European Commission went in the other direction and fined the company $2.9 billion and ordered it to change its search results.  The different outcomes hinge in part on different approaches. European regulators are more likely to see a shrinking pool of competitors as inherently bad for both competition and consumers. American regulators are more open to the possibility that it could be natural and benign.  In new industries, smaller players are frequently bought up or vanquished by deeper-pocketed, more-innovative rivals. Google\u2019s general counsel, Kent Walker, wrote in response to the European Commission decision that even as smaller sites have retreated, Amazon has grown to become a huge player in comparison shopping.  Internet platforms have high fixed and minimal operating costs, which favors consolidation into a few deep-pocketed competitors. And the more customers a platform has, the more useful it is to each individual customer\u2014the \u201cnetwork effect.\u201d  But a platform that confers monopoly in one market can be leveraged to dominate another. Facebook\u2019s existing user base enabled it to become the world\u2019s largest photo-sharing site through its purchase of Instagram in 2012 and the largest instant-messaging provider through its purchase of WhatsApp in 2014. It is also muscling into virtual reality through its acquisition of Oculus VR in 2014 and anonymous polling with its purchase of TBH last year.  Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg speaks at a developers conference last year in San Jose, Calif. Photo: Stephen Lam/REUTERS  What Facebook doesn\u2019t acquire, it copies. Snap Inc.\u2019s Snapchat, a fast-disappearing photo and video sharing app hugely popular with teenagers, was widely seen as a challenger to Facebook. But in 2016, Facebook introduced its own Snapchat-like feature, Stories, on Instagram, which now has more users and advertisers than Snapchat. That has undercut Snap\u2019s growth and profits by reducing the number of new users \u201cinterested in trying Snap for the first time,\u201d says Peter Stabler, an analyst at Wells Fargo.  There\u2019s nothing wrong with copying, especially if the copy is better than the original. Snapchat\u2019s app was originally difficult to use, says Mr. Stabler, and \u201cyou can\u2019t discount [Facebook\u2019s] quality of execution.\u201d Moreover, even as Facebook copies its competitors, it continues to expand and enhance its own services such as Pages, which 70 million businesses world-wide have used to design their own webpages on Facebook.  Snap\u2019s shares have sunk below the price at which the company went public last March as losses have mounted, which won\u2019t encourage new entrants. Once a company like Google or Facebook has critical mass, \u201cthe venture capital looks elsewhere,\u201d says Roger McNamee of Elevation Partners, a technology-focused private-equity firm. \u201cThere\u2019s no point taking on someone with a three or four years head start.\u201d  Amazon hasn\u2019t yet reached the same market share as Google or Facebook but its position is arguably even more impregnable because it enjoys both physical and technological barriers to entry. Its roughly 75 fulfillment centers and state-of-the art logistics (including robots) put it closer, in time and space, to customers than any other online retailer.  The company says size makes it possible to deliver millions of items free of shipping charges to isolated communities with little retail presence. Amazon makes that network available to third-party merchants who pay a 15% commission and, typically, a $3 pick-pack-and ship-fee, says Greg Mercer, founder of Jungle Scout Inc. which advises third-party merchants how to sell on Amazon. \u201cWe have tons of examples of small entrepreneurial-type people who are really good at creating new inventions but have no idea how to distribute to the masses,\u201d he says. \u201cThey create products and Amazon can take care of the rest.\u201d  An Amazon warehouse in Britain. Photo: Jane Barlow/PA Images/Getty Images  As the dominant platform for third-party online sales, Amazon also has access to data it can use to decide what products to sell itself. In 2016 Capitol Forum, a news service that investigates anticompetitive behavior, reported that when a shopper views an Amazon private-label clothing brand, the accompanying list of items labeled \u201cCustomers Who Bought This Item Also Bought,\u201d is also dominated by Amazon\u2019s private-label brands. This, it says, restricts competing sellers\u2019 access to a prime marketing space  Mr. Mercer says he doesn\u2019t see Amazon favoring its own products, and indeed his own firm helps merchants target profitable niches on Amazon. Nonetheless, he says many would prefer to sell through their own sites, but with so many shoppers searching first on Amazon, they feel they have little choice.  In the face of such accusations, the probability of regulatory action\u2014for now\u2014looks low, largely because U.S. regulators have a relatively high bar to clear: Do consumers suffer?  \u201cWe think consumer welfare is the right standard,\u201d Bruce Hoffman, the FTC\u2019s acting director of the bureau of competition, recently told a panel on antitrust law and innovation. \u201cWe have tried other standards. They were dismal failures.\u201d  Still, Ms. Scott Morton notes, \u201cthe consumer welfare standard covers today and tomorrow,\u201d and the potential loss of innovation is something both the law and the courts can and have weighed in an antitrust case.

Since Big Tech owes its network effects to data, one often-proposed fix is to give users ownership of their own data: the \u201csocial graph\u201d of connections on Facebook, or their search history on Google and Amazon. They could then take it to a competitor.  A more drastic remedy would be to block acquisitions of companies that might one day be a competing platform. British regulators let Facebook buy Instagram in part because Instagram didn\u2019t sell ads, which they argued made them different businesses. In fact, Facebook used Instagram to engage users longer and thus sell more ads, Ben Thompson, wrote in his technology newsletter Stratechery. Building a network is \u201cextremely difficult, but, once built, nearly impregnable. The only possible antidote is another network that draws away the one scarce resource: attention.\u201d Thus, maintaining competition on the internet requires keeping \u201csocial networks in separate competitive companies.\u201d  How sound are these premises? Google\u2019s and Facebook\u2019s access to that data and network effects might seem like an impregnable barrier, but the same appeared to be true of America Online\u2019s membership, Yahoo \u2019s search engine and Apple\u2019s iTunes store, note two economists, David Evans and Richard Schmalensee, in a recent paper. All saw their dominance recede in the face of disruptive competition. If someone launched a clearly superior search engine, social network or online store, consumers could switch more easily than they could telephone or oil companies a century ago. Microsoft has long dominated desktop operating systems but has failed to extend that dominance to internet search or to mobile operating systems.  It\u2019s possible Microsoft might have become the dominant company in search and mobile without the scrutiny the federal antitrust case brought. Throughout history, entrepreneurs have often needed the government\u2019s help to dislodge a monopolist\u2014and may one day need it again.

French President Emmanuel Macron attends a hearing to mark the beginning of the year in Paris on Monday. Photo: LUDOVIC MARIN, PRESS POOL  VERSAILLES, France\u2014French president Emmanuel Macron wined and dined Davos-bound business leaders inside the Palace of Versailles on Monday in an effort to shake off the country\u2019s image as a guillotine for foreign investment.  Some 140 executives, including Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai, met with Mr. Macron at the sprawling palace just outside Paris before traveling on to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.  The event, dubbed \u201cChoose France\u201d by Mr. Macron, is an attempt to persuade business leaders that France has finally changed its ways. Long criticized as a land of excessive red-tape and government meddling in the private sector, France is striking a different pose under Mr. Macron.  The investment banker-turned-president has adopted myriad pro-business measures during his first eight months in office, from looser labor laws to tax cuts. Now he is under pressure to show these changes can spur investment.  So far the results are mixed. While the French economy is growing again and economists expect unemployment to fall in the coming months, the latest figures showed the jobless rate rose to 9.7% at the end of the third quarter of 2017 from 9.5% in the second.  Mr. Macron used the Versailles meeting to announce a handful of investment projects officials said are \u201csignificant or emblematic\u201d for France\u2019s economic future, in areas from auto manufacturing to technology.  Facebook pledged Monday to double the size of its artificial intelligence lab in France to 60 researchers. Google said it would open an artificial intelligence research center in France and confirmed plans to increase staff at its Paris office to just over 1,000 from 700. Toyota said it would invest \u20ac300 million (about $367.3 million) at a site in the north of France, creating 700 permanent jobs.  Prior to the summit, Mr. Macron told businesses leaders they would only be invited to Versailles if they came promising a new investment project.  \u201cIt\u2019s not about asking for advice on such and such measure. We\u2019re saying: come and invest in France and create jobs,\u201d a French official said ahead of the visit.  Surveys show Mr. Macron has reasons to be optimistic. An annual poll by Ipsos of 200 France-based executives at international firms showed in November that 60% consider the country an attractive place to do business compared to 36% a year earlier. According to the same poll, 62% say the government is overhauling the economy at the right pace compared to 2% in the fall of 2016.  \u201cThe proof is here that France has once again become attractive for the biggest foreign investors,\u201d said Economy and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire.  France\u2019s changing image, however, will take time to show in quantitative measures of investment and hiring as companies need to adjust to new labor laws and changes to tax, business leaders say. The French government is also worried the U.S. tax overhaul could make it less attractive for U.S. firms to invest in Europe.  Business leaders held short meetings with Mr. Macron\u2019s cabinet in the afternoon in a format officials describe as \u201cspeed dating.\u201d Before hosting a dinner with all the delegates, Mr. Macron had 20-minute one-on-one meetings with Ms. Sandberg, Mr. Pichai, Novartis Chief Executive Vasant Narisimhan and SAP SE Chief Executive Bill McDermott.

Under the deal, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL -0.12% entered a contract to buy the Chelsea Market building at 75 Ninth Ave. from Jamestown LP, according to a person familiar with the transaction.  The potential acquisition comes as Amazon.com Inc., narrows its search for a second headquarters, and underscores the large impact the two companies can have on cities, raising real-estate values and adding high-paying jobs. The Alphabet deal also highlights New York City\u2019s ascendance in the past decade as one of the country\u2019s leading technology hubs.  Amazon has named New York City among the 20 finalists to host a second headquarters.  Technology companies have been increasing their share of office space in the Manhattan market over the past several years, with household names such as Amazon, Facebook Inc., Spotify USA and others signing large lease deals.  In the San Francisco Bay Area, tech companies have been gobbling up more space than they need in the short term to ensure they have enough capacity for workers and equipment down the line.  That might be playing out in New York too. The Chelsea Market deal \u201cis a potential land grab, where these firms are competing against one another, and you might see these firms take space defensively to ensure that they will have the space even though they don\u2019t need it now,\u201d said Sacha Zarba, vice chairman of real-estate-services firm CBRE Inc.  Google already has offices in the 1.2 million-square-foot building, which houses offices on the upper floors and shops and restaurants on the ground and lower-level floors. The building is home to other companies, including Major League Baseball Advanced Media and the Food Network.  The web-search giant also owns the 2.9 million-square-foot building at 111 Eighth Ave., which it bought in 2010. In addition, it has leased more than 200,000 square feet at Pier 57, a former freight terminal. The Chelsea neighborhood and Meatpacking District are part of the Midtown South office submarket, which is a favorite of the technology sector and has had vacancy rates that are among the lowest in the U.S.  New York City\u2019s technology landscape has changed dramatically over the last decade, when skeptics doubted whether its labor force could support a large technology hub.  \u201cAny further long-term real-estate commitments by Google are proof positive that New York is the present and future home for technology innovation and the most fertile ground for talent retention,\u201d said Doug Harmon, of Cushman & Wakefield, a longtime adviser to Jamestown and the broker who worked on this transaction and the sale of 111 Eighth Ave. to Alphabet.  \ufeff GOOGL -0.12% The Chelsea Market deal was reported earlier by the Real Deal.  The potential acquisition of the Chelsea Market building also highlights some of the options that global companies, especially tech companies, are now considering as the new tax law takes effect. The law reduced the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35% and included incentives for companies to bring offshore profits back to the U.S.  \u201cIf you\u2019re bringing that much cash back, you are now probably looking for ways to deploy it,\u201d said Woody Heller, a vice chairman at real estate services firm Savills Studley.

Facebook said earlier this month it would change its centerpiece News Feed to prioritize what friends and family share, while reducing the amount of non-advertising content from publishers and brands.  Those changes contributed to a fall in quarterly time spent that added up to about 5 percent on Facebook and 4 percent on its platforms including Instagram.  \u201cWe continue to believe that any slowdown in time spent will be compensated for by higher-quality time spent, and that any trimming of ad load will be compensated for by higher ad pricing,\u201d Graham said.  While the number of daily users in the United States and Canada fell for the first time in Facebook\u2019s history, the average price per ad increased 43 percent in quarter.  One reason for the ad dollars to continue to grow strongly through these changes was that Facebook\u2019s ad targeting tools and offerings deliver return-on-investment for advertisers, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak said.  Out of the 46 analysts that cover Facebook\u2019s stock, 37 now rate it at \u201cbuy\u201d or higher, two at \u201chold\u201d and two at \u201csell\u201d or lower.

The Federation of German Consumer Organisations (vzvb) said that Facebook\u2019s default settings and some of its terms of service were in breach of consumer law, and that the court had found parts of the consent to data usage to be invalid.  \u201cFacebook hides default settings that are not privacy-friendly in its privacy center and does not provide sufficient information about it when users register,\u201d said Heiko Duenkel, litigation policy officer at the vzvb.  \u201cThis does not meet the requirement for informed consent.\u201d The vzvb posted a copy of the ruling on its website.

This includes tapping information from its own WhatsApp and Instagram products - as well as how it tracks which sites its users access.  One concern highlighted by the consumer rights group was that, in Facebook\u2019s app for smartphones, a service was pre-activated that revealed the user\u2019s location to the person they were chatting to.  Also, in the privacy settings, ticks were already placed in boxes that allowed search engines to link to the user\u2019s timeline, meaning that anyone would be able quickly and easily to find a user\u2019s profile.  \u201cThe judges ruled that all five of the default settings on Facebook that vzvb complained about are invalid,\u201d the group said in a statement, adding that several other of Facebook\u2019s terms of use were found to be illegal.", "stock": "FB", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-12", "source": "reuters", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-facebook/german-court-rules-facebook-use-of-personal-data-illegal-idUSKBN1FW1FI"}, {"article": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York state\u2019s highest court ruled on Tuesday that Facebook users may be required to turn over photos and other information that are relevant to litigation, even if they are shielded by \u201cprivacy\u201d settings.

Kelly Forman said she became a recluse after suffering a spinal injury and brain damage, making it hard to read and write, in a June 2011 fall caused by Mark Henkin\u2019s negligence in fitting her horse with a defective stirrup that broke.  To defend himself against Forman\u2019s damages claims, Henkin sought access to her entire \u201cprivate\u201d Facebook account.  In February 2014, a trial judge ordered Forman to give Henkin pre-accident photos she intended to use at trial, post-accident photos not depicting nudity or romantic encounters, and access to post-accident records of her messages.  But in December 2015, a state appeals court limited the disclosure to photos intended for trial, saying Henkin could not go on a \u201cfishing expedition\u201d for evidence.  DiFiore, however, reinstated the trial judge\u2019s ruling, saying the appeals court erred in employing a \u201cheightened threshold\u201d for disclosing social media records that depended on what users chose to share publicly.  \u201cSome materials on a Facebook account may fairly be characterized as private,\u201d DiFiore wrote, \u201cbut even private materials may be subject to discovery if they are relevant.\u201d  Henkin\u2019s photo request \u201cwas reasonably calculated to yield evidence relevant to plaintiff\u2019s assertion that she could no longer engage in the activities she enjoyed before the accident and that she had become reclusive,\u201d she added.

REUTERS/Philippe Wojazer/File Photo  The settlement was filed on Monday in the federal court in Manhattan and won preliminary approval from U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet.  It amounts to a small fraction of Facebook\u2019s current market value of roughly $537 billion as of Monday\u2019s market close.  Shareholders led by the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System and Fresno County Employees\u2019 Retirement Association in California accused Facebook of concealing internal concerns about how growth in mobile devices might reduce revenue, even as it quietly warned its banks to cut their forecasts.  Unlike in 2012, the Menlo Park, California-based company now generates most of its revenue from mobile devices and has estimated that mobile advertising generated more than 86 percent of its $40.7 billion total revenue in 2017.  The settlement resolves claims against Facebook, officials including Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and director Peter Thiel, and bank underwriters covering a five-day period surrounding the $16 billion IPO, from May 17 to May 21, 2012.  Facebook made its market debut on May 18 of that year at $38 per share and saw its share price languish below that level for more than a year before it rebounded.  \u201cResolving this case is in the best interests of the company and our shareholders,\u201d Associate General Counsel Sandeep Solanki said in a statement.  A lawyer for the shareholders did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Sweet scheduled a Sept. 5 hearing to consider final settlement approval.  The accord was reached after mediation, and provides an average recovery of about 11 cents per share, or 7 cents per share after possible legal fees and costs, court papers show.  Insurers may cover some of the payout.  Lawyers for the shareholders called the settlement \u201cfair, reasonable, and adequate,\u201d citing the risk of a loss at trial, according to court papers.

The company is going on a spree. Facebook has said its costs for web video programs, people to patrol the social network for abusive posts, its virtual reality project and other investments will swell by 45 percent to 60 percent this year. Investors are mostly fine with this. The company has justified the spending on its top priorities, including guarding against Russia-backed misinformation campaigns or other abuses.  But there is another category of costs that is likely to increase at a much faster clip, and Facebook hasn't detailed why. The company last week repeated a forecast that its capital costs -- spending on fleets of computer equipment, new corporate buildings and other physical assets -- will more than double, from $6.7 billion in 2017 to an estimated $14 billion to $15 billion in 2018.  Hey, Big Spender Facebook expects its capital expenses will more than double in 2018 Data: Bloomberg and Facebook's 2018 forecast; graphic by Bloomberg Gadfly  Even when Facebook was growing quickly into a titan, its capital costs never doubled from one year to the next. Facebook executives have said the significantly higher capital spending in 2018 will be for computing networks and other investments to \"support growth and improve our products,\" as the company's top finance executive said in November.  That's not much of an explanation for what is both an astounding jump in capital spending and a stunning overall sum. Companies with $14 billion or more in yearly capital expenditures tend to be those that make complex physical products such as computer chips or cars.  Facebook rearranges pixels; it doesn't drill for oil and gas as Exxon Mobil does. And yet Exxon's capital spending is on par with Facebook's 2018 forecast, at about $14.8 billion in the 12 months ended Sept. 30, according to Bloomberg data. Insert the cliche about how \"data is the new oil.\"  Investors have not publicly pressed Facebook to explain how it will spend its 2018 capital budget. They are fixated on far more pressing issues, including the company's effort to weed out harmful behavior on the social network, ward off potential regulatory crackdowns and expand important businesses including internet video and Instagram, the Facebook-owned app. As long as Facebook's financials continue to be healthy, stockholders are likely to remain unconcerned about a big step up in capital costs.  But there is a precedent that should worry Facebook a little. A few years ago, Google's capital spending was growing significantly. It more than doubled in 2013 and surged 49 percent in 2014. To investors, the capital spending increases were among the evidence that Google had become financially undisciplined. The company's stock price declined 5 percent for the year.  Then Google hired a new chief financial officer and imposed a stricter watch on its wallet. Capex declined in 2015 and has increased more slowly ever since. Google's commitment to spending discipline was among the reasons investors regained confidence in it.  Catching Up Facebook may have a bigger tab of capital spending this year than Google's parent company, whose revenue is twice as large Data: Bloomberg and Facebook forecasts; graphic by Bloomberg Gadfly  If Facebook's 2018 capital costs match the company's forecast, it may pass Google parent company Alphabet in capital spending, even though the web search giant's revenue is twice as large. Facebook may also join the ranks of Google, Intel and Apple of the U.S. technology industry's biggest capex spenders. (South Korea's sprawling electronics giant Samsung has by far the largest capex spending of global tech companies.)  Big Leagues Facebook's expected 2018 capital costs would put it among the world's top spending tech companies Data: Bloomberg and Facebook's 2018 forecast; graphic by Bloomberg Gadfly  The rising capex tab for Facebook is another reminder that the world's web habits require costly and complex underlying infrastructure of internet pipes, computers, electricity and people to keep it all humming.  It's also possible Facebook has some secrets up its sleeve that will require a big step up in capital costs. Bloomberg News has reported that Facebook is working on more consumer hardware, including a home videoconferencing device, and those ambitions require new kinds of spending.  Facebook's capital binge hasn't attracted much attention from investors. But if the company's revenue grows more slowly than investors expect, those costs may suddenly look worrisome.

The company kept warning that its rate of revenue growth would slow and that its plans to spend more money and remodel Facebook into less of a cesspool would drag down profit margins and perhaps result in people using Facebook less.  Investors learned not to be so concerned about Facebook's predictions of impending doom, although now it looks as if some of those cautions are coming true and outsiders weren't sufficiently braced for it.  Facebook said on Wednesday that its revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 rose 47 percent from a year earlier. Yes, that was (barely) the sixth consecutive quarter of slowing growth for Facebook; but come on, it's impressive for a company of Facebook's size to regularly boost sales at this pace. Out of 300 global companies of Facebook's size, only a few are growing more quickly, Bloomberg data show.  What, Me Worry? Facebook has warned its revenue growth would start to slow by now. It's not much of a slowdown, though. Source: Bloomberg and Facebook  The fourth-quarter revenue performance came despite Facebook's repeated warnings that its advertising sales growth would slow noticeably at this point because of its decision to stop shoving more ads into the Facebook news feed. It's clear that Facebook more than made up the difference thanks to higher ad prices and new types of advertisements that appeal to companies eager to pitch to Facebook's giant audience.  Wall Street does expect Facebook's sales to slow meaningfully soon. Analysts think Facebook's revenue will increase about 33 percent in 2018, according to the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That's slow for Facebook but impressive in any rational world. It makes sense for any company to underpromise and over-deliver. But given how often Facebook has warned investors that its financials will start to look a little less handsome, they may not believe the company if the ugliness really comes this time.  That's more of a worry now because Facebook has started to fire up the alarms about other elements of its business, and those appear to be coming true. CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently said his decision to change the formula to prioritize \"meaningful social interaction\" on Facebook might cause people to spend less time hanging out on the social network.  The company disclosed on Wednesday the slowest rate of growth in its history in the number of daily users. The number of users in North America fell for the first time in the fourth quarter. And Facebook said that the changes it made to play down viral videos and other less-than-optimal programming reduced the time spent on Facebook by roughly 50 million hours each day. That works out to roughly 2 minutes for each of Facebook's 1.4 billion daily users.  Uh Oh In the fourth quarter, Facebook posted its slowest-ever growth rate in daily users Source: Bloomberg and Facebook  In principle, though, even a small reduction isn't good for Facebook's future advertising revenue because the more time people spend on Facebook, the more chances Facebook has to sell paid commercials. Facebook shares dipped about 4 percent in trading after the regular market close before rebounding.  The worry, of course, is that Facebook's second quarter of relatively meek daily user growth may be the result of people's dislike of hanging out on Facebook. And that's an existential threat to Facebook's popularity and its business. That's worthy of five ringing alarms of caution. The changes Facebook made to its news feed were announced after the end of 2017. It seems likely, then, that slowing daily user growth in the fourth quarter wasn't caused by the news feed changes, and that more declines in time spent may be coming.  Other fears have yet to come to pass. Facebook has also said it will spend much more this year on people and technology to oversee posts and advertising, to avoid a repeat of the 2016 Russian-backed misinformation campaigns that remain the subject of congressional inquiry. It also plans to spend more on video programming for its TV-like digital hangout and to build up relatively young businesses including virtual reality and artificial intelligence.  Facebook has warned that this increased spending will hurt its profit margins in 2018, but investors don't seem to believe it. Wall Street's expectations work out to an expected 2018 operating income margin of 43 percent, Bloomberg data show. Facebook ended 2017 by posting a record 57 percent quarterly operating margin. That gives the company room to spend more without dragging its margins to worrisome levels.  Profit Powerhouse Facebook has higher operating profit margins than all but a handful of 500 large U.S. companies Source: Bloomberg  Facebook has been tamping down expectations for so long, investors didn't take seriously enough the company's cries of distress. And as the stock reaction from Facebook's user growth and engagement numbers show, investors weren't prepared for Facebook's warnings to come to fruition.

In the past, Facebook executives have explained that in the technology industry, copying what works is sometimes necessary. Facebook wasn\u2019t the first social network, just like Google\u2019s Gmail wasn\u2019t the first email service. Facebook has publicly credited Snapchat for creating the popular \"stories\" function that allows people to post disappearing videos about their days, which is now more popular on Facebook\u2019s properties than it is on Snapchat.  BlackBerry was an early pioneer in messaging. Its proprietary service BBM helped draw millions to its phones in the mid-2000s when the company was a smartphone leader. But the company waited years before opening BBM up to phones running Apple Inc. or Alphabet Inc. operating systems, and as those companies took over the smartphone market, BBM\u2019s popularity faded along with BlackBerry\u2019s devices.  Under Chief Executive Officer John Chen, BlackBerry has stopped making its own phones and pivoted to focus on security-focused software. License payments from its old wireless patents still bring in revenue though, and the company has won other court battles in the past, most notably a $814.9 million windfall from Qualcomm Inc.

MLB owners unanimously approved the move, the league said. Neither MLB nor Facebook disclosed the financial terms, though people with knowledge of the matter put the price at $30 million to $35 million. They asked not to be identified because the terms are private.  \u201cMuch like the migration of sports from broadcast to cable, you\u2019re reaching these milestones where the combination of the financial incentive and the audience allow you to make the next great leap,\u201d said Lee Berke, an industry consultant. \u201cThis is part of the next great leap.\u201d  The games add to Facebook\u2019s growing sports lineup. Last year, the company struck deals with Fox Sports to stream the UEFA Champions League and with Univision to broadcast live games from Mexico\u2019s top soccer league. The company also had 20 non-exclusive MLB games last season and acquired exclusive rights to stream 47 college basketball games involving smaller conferences this year.  With 1.4 billion active daily users, the world\u2019s biggest social network is also still growing, in contrast with conventional TV networks that have been losing viewers and advertising. Facebook\u2019s ad revenue last year totaled $40 billion.  Weekday Afternoons  All of the games will take place on weekday afternoons, primarily Wednesdays. The agreement begins with the April 4 game between the Philadelphia Phillies and New York Mets. Viewers will be able to watch on smartphones, tablets, computers and other connected devices, including home TVs.  The games will be produced by the MLB Network, meaning they\u2019ll have a broadcast look and feel. For Facebook, however, the rights allow for experimentation with things like social integration and graphics during the broadcast, enhancements popular with younger viewers drawn to digital platforms.  Facebook will also have rights to show the baseball games globally, though they won\u2019t be exclusive outside the U.S. MLB and Facebook will update the schedule on a monthly basis.

But an ongoing court fight in Silicon Valley shows that even after the world\u2019s largest social network changed its policy in 2014 to protect user information from being exploited by outsiders, its power to control access to sensitive data is still hotly contested.  Photos on Facebook of you and your friends in bikinis and Speedos are safe for now, but if the makers of the Pikinis app prevail in their lawsuit, it would once again be open season for subscribers to pay a $1.99 fee to instantly locate swimsuit pictures.  The app was shut down three years ago when Facebook cut off third-party access to a back-door channel to friends\u2019 data -- about a year after that same channel allowed a Soviet-born American researcher to gather basic profile information on millions of Facebook users and provide the data to an analytics firm that helped elect President Donald Trump.  But Six4Three LLC, the developer of Pikinis, has refused to let its business model die. It alleges that Facebook engaged in \u201can anti-competitive bait-and-switch scheme\u201d that duped Six4Three and tens of thousands of other developers into making hefty investments to build apps and then decided \u201cit would be in Facebook\u2019s best interest to no longer compete with many developers and to shut down their businesses.\u201d  Facebook contends the suit is bankrolled by a single investor in Six4Three seeking a $100 million windfall on a business that made little more than $400 in sales during the short-lived existence of Pikinis. The social network also says it gave developers a full year\u2019s warning before it ended access to friends\u2019 newsfeeds and photos.  \u201cFacebook made -- and must continue to make -- important editorial decisions about what third party content is available through its platform to protect its users\u2019 privacy and experience,\u201d the company argued in a February court filing.

Changes rolled out so far by Facebook Inc., Twitter Inc. and other technology companies wouldn\u2019t prevent the tactics revealed Friday by U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation of Russian operatives -- let alone any new hacks dreamed up by bad actors.  An indictment issued by Mueller said at least 13 Russians engaged in a sophisticated campaign to sway public opinion around the 2016 presidential election. They posed as U.S. citizens, using falsified paperwork and stolen bank numbers, to hide their real identities and opened PayPal Holdings Inc. accounts to buy ads on popular social media sites.  The narrative laid out by Mueller describes a more advanced Russian-backed misinformation effort than previously known. Until now, Facebook and Twitter had been criticized for missing Russian purchases of U.S. election ads through their systems. PayPal hadn\u2019t featured publicly in the investigations until Friday.  The identity theft detailed in the indictment is tougher than the problems these companies have so far tried to solve. Facebook is boosting its security-focused workforce and adding transparency for who purchases ads. Twitter is creating a \u201ctransparency center\u201d on political campaign ad spending, too. Alphabet Inc.\u2019s YouTube is hiring thousands of people to vet videos. None of these steps would prevent foreign agents from using stolen identities and bank accounts to buy divisive ads and create misleading posts.  PayPal is a pioneer in online identity and fraud detection. And yet, it\u2019s digital payments service was the funding vehicle for the Russian operatives\u2019 deceptive campaigns -- making their transactions appear in social media companies\u2019 systems like any other purchases in U.S. dollars.  The Russians\u2019 approach raises the question of whether other parties have bought -- or will buy -- ads using stolen identities. It also undermines the main value of social media business models: That people are who they say they are. Facebook and Twitter sell ads through automated systems where brands can opt to reach certain audiences, and later find out how many people they reached. Friday\u2019s indictment shows how this system can be easily gamed, and highlights the risk that even more accounts may not be fake, eroding trust in those metrics.  Meanwhile, as long as social media platforms work the way they do, by making it easy to pay to spread incendiary messages, it\u2019s hard to see this problem going away, said Zeynep Tufekci, an information sciences professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  \u201cThey used the platforms as they were designed,\u201d Tufekci wrote on Twitter from a verified account. \u201cAll the problems most everyone is worried about will be with us pretty much at the same scale in 2018 and 2020 even if not another ruble is spent on U.S. elections.\u201d  The indictment also described how the Russian operatives used online distribution and marketing tactics that were as advanced as any legitimate social media campaign -- making it difficult for companies to detect anomalies. The operatives worked in shifts to ensure they made posts in accordance with U.S. time zones and circulated lists of U.S. holidays so the accounts posing as citizens could post appropriate content, according to the indictment. They also regularly evaluated their content to make sure it appeared authentic, and received feedback on how much text, graphics or video to use to appear naturally American.  The indictment has already renewed calls to regulate social media. Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, said Mueller\u2019s investigation shows Russia was using online ads to wage an \u201cinformation war\u201d against the U.S. and Congress should pass new laws to police political advertising on social media immediately.  \u201cWe do not have time to wait. If Congress continues to refuse to act, we are aiding Russia\u2019s efforts to divide and influence our nation\u2014inaction is unacceptable,\u201d Klobuchar said in an emailed statement. She is a co-sponsor of the Honest Ads Act, which would regulate online election ads.  Next month, the Federal Election Commission will also consider a proposal to require online political ads to carry the same disclaimers from sponsors as do radio, television and print ads.  \u201cWe know we have more to do to prevent against future attacks,\" Joel Kaplan, Facebook\u2019s vice president of global policy, said in a statement on Friday.  Facebook is working closely with the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and other companies on better ways to protect the U.S. and the company\u2019s users, he added. The FBI has created task force on election interference, and Facebook is actively working with the agency, Kaplan also said.  Ahead of midterm elections in the U.S. later this year, Twitter said it\u2019s verifying major party candidates for all statewide and federal elective offices, and major national party accounts, as a \"hedge against impersonation.\" The company is also improving its anti-spam technology to track down networks of malicious bots targeting election-related matters, while monitoring trends and spikes in conversations about the 2018 elections to spot potential manipulation.  \"Tech companies cannot defeat this novel, shared threat alone,\" Twitter said in a statement. \"The best approach is to share information and ideas to increase our collective  knowledge, with the full weight of government and law enforcement leading the charge against threats to our democracy.\"", "stock": "FB", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-17", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-17/facebook-twitter-ill-equipped-to-stop-repeat-of-2016-meddling"}, {"article": "Russian operatives using social media to manipulate the U.S. election bought their Facebook ads in a sophisticated manner: stealing the identities of Americans and opening accounts at PayPal Holdings Inc.  \u201cDefendants and their co-conspirators also obtained, and attempted to obtain, false identification documents to use as proof of identity in connection with maintaining accounts and purchasing advertisements on social media sites,\u201d according to an indictment issued Friday by U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller.

They bought stolen bank account numbers online as well, using them to bypass PayPal\u2019s security system and open accounts, with which they bought Facebook ads.  PayPal accounts were used for general expenses, the purchase of advertisements and to buy buttons, flags and banners for the political rallies organized through the social media scheme, according to the indictment.  The ads purchased by Russian actors on Facebook went through an automated buying system, where they are only flagged if they break rules on the social network related to its community standards. The company has since bolstered the team that reviews ads and is planning to add tools to let users know who is behind them. Still, that is unlikely to solve a problem of stolen identity behind a purchase.  The revelation ratchets up the pressure on Facebook and Twitter to bolster their defenses, or risk government regulation.

He said the notion was supported by both intelligence at the time and the indictment unsealed Friday by Special Counsel Robert Mueller against 13 Russian nationals and three Russian entities.  Rob Goldman, Facebook\u2019s vice president of ad sales, tweeted Friday that \u201cswaying the election was *NOT* the main goal\u201d -- prompting President Donald Trump to retweet the message the next day to back his claim that Russian meddling didn\u2019t affect the results of the election. The Russians\u2019 aim was to help Trump and hurt his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, as well as to sow discord, according to the indictment.  \u201cNever before have we seen an effort like this mounted by the Russians,\u201d said Clapper, who described an \u201cambient level\u201d of attempts at interference by Russia and the Soviet Union going back to the 1960s and more activity in 2015 and 2016. \u201cThe multidimensional nature of it and its aggressiveness and directness: This was unprecedented,\u201d he said.  Evidence Cited  Among the evidence Goldman pointed to in a series of posts was that 56 percent of the Facebook ads bought by the indicted Russians were displayed after the Nov. 8 election. The company verified his posts as authentic.  In a follow-up tweet, Goldman attempted to soften his earlier comments by saying that \u201cthe Russian campaign was certainly in favor of Trump. The point is that the misinformation campaign is ongoing and must be addressed.\u201d  Clapper warned on Sunday that the Russians \u201care going to continue\u201d with their efforts.

With the platform so central to an investigation that Trump has politicized, that image is complicated to maintain. The president using an executive\u2019s tweet to support his views may be even more uncomfortable for the company.

Then blockchain came along.  After stumbling onto a new corner of the internet based on the digital-ledger technology, Kadavy said he gets paid to post his blog and podcast on Steemit, a website whose text are saved on a blockchain. The site has its own digital currencies, the best-known of which is called Steem, and pays people such as Kadavy who post and comment on the site. Kadavy, a 38-year-old American writer living in Colombia, said he made about $2,000 in January.  \u201cI feel like I\u2019m in the Stone Age when I\u2019m on Facebook or Twitter,\u201d Kadavy said. \u201cThey have no value without what you\u2019re contributing to them. If Facebook doesn\u2019t respond to this, things can change very quickly. They should be very concerned.\u201d  The so-called financial internet stands the Facebook business model on its head. With Facebook, users post content on the site and the company collects the money -- last year, $41 billion in revenue. On Steemit, the money goes in the other direction. Facebook, with 2.1 billion monthly users, may not even see Steemit, which says 9 million users visit each month, in its rear-view mirror. But Kadavy is just one of hundreds of thousands of people who make money by posting, playing games and viewing ads on the new blockchain-based sites and apps, where nearly every user action is linked to token-based compensation.  More than 1,000 such projects that record data onto digital ledgers and are called dapps, for decentralized applications, are live or in testing. And they often let users earn their special coins or cryptocurrency by doing something they\u2019d already done for nothing on other sites.  Facebook and Twitter didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.  Worth Dollars  Some pre-blockchain sites let users tip content creators from their own funds. Very few did. Sites like Steemit give content creators a portion of newly minted tokens that are being mined all the time. Most of the tokens can be traded on exchanges, so they\u2019re worth something in dollars. And like Steem, many of these coins have appreciated. Steem stands at $3.55, up from 11 cents a year ago.  Tokens are a big reason why two-year-old Steemit already has about 100,000 content creators, according to Chief Executive Officer Ned Scott. It just broke into the top 1,000 of the web\u2019s biggest sites, according to tracker Alexa.  Steem Token's Market Cap In the Past Year In Billions of Dollars Source: CoinMarketCap.com  \u201cI attribute almost all of Steemit\u2019s growth to the reality it\u2019s distributed money to members of the community,\u201d Scott said in an interview. \u201cThere\u2019s been very little marketing. It\u2019s been all organic conversations that have led to the growth of the platform. A majority of the people who continue to stick around are being compensated for their time.\u201d  Financial Internet in Infancy  Scott, a former financial analyst for a food-importing company, got Steemit off the ground with a $250,000 angel investment. The site doesn\u2019t sell ads. Instead, it owns a portion of the issued tokens.  This new financial Internet is still in its infancy. It pays users a total of $3.5 million, but within two years, users could be paid $50 million a year, according to Susan Eustis, CEO of WinterGreen Research. The market could expand to $180 million within five years, she said in an email. Billionaire investor Tim Draper said that tokens and cryptocurrencies will grab 33 percent of all commerce in the next 10 years.  Sites such as Facebook and Twitter could benefit immediately by allowing users to tip content providers in Bitcoin, Draper, one of the world\u2019s biggest investors in digital money, said in an email.  Money for Playing  While games such as Zynga Inc.\u2019s FarmVille have long used virtual currencies, the money can\u2019t be taken out of the games. That\u2019s not the case with tokens. Services like Bancor can convert an obscure token into one that can be traded on an exchange. In a sign of the financial internet\u2019s traction, conversion volume on the Bancor network has climbed to more than $37 million per week in January from $3 million per week in November, according to the company.  Startup Storj pays people to store files for others on unused hard-drive space. Golem will soon let users get paid for letting artists do renderings by using their computers\u2019 power.

CryptoKitties, a digital game, is a platform for people to collect and breed virtual cats -- and to sell the virtual kittens.  Privacy Rules  CryptoKitties \u201cactually turned out to be my most profitable crypto asset,\u201d player Michael Rinderman, 26, said in an email. Since starting to play the game in early 2018, he turned an investment of one Ether into 10 Ethers; each Ether is currently worth $868.  Obstacles stand in the way of the financial internet. New privacy rules in Europe require sites to erase user information under certain circumstances. That could be problematic, as the blockchain is immutable and usually can\u2019t be changed easily.  Digital ledgers could also make it difficult to take down libelous content because it lives forever there, said Samit Singh, CEO of Decentralized News Network, an online publisher that\u2019s in alpha testing.  More importantly, most digital ledgers have problems scaling as more users jump on board. Recently, Ethereum blockchain screeched to a halt as too many users began playing CryptoKitties.  \u201cThese decentralized systems are just not made to grow and scale for the masses yet,\u201d said Anthony Di Iorio, co-founder of Ethereum, said in an interview. \u201cThere are always problems with early technology. It takes time.\u201d  But, he notes, it\u2019s worth the wait. \u201cThis will be more important than the internet,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be massively disruptive for every sector.\u201d", "stock": "FB", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-27", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-27/websites-using-blockchain-to-pay-users-aim-to-disrupt-facebook"}, {"article": "Facebook Inc. wants to set the record straight: presidential candidate Donald Trump spent slightly more per ad on the site than his rival Hillary Clinton did ahead of the general election in 2016.  The revelation comes after a former employee wrote an article for Wired that posited a theory: since Facebook ads are sold through a bidding system, and Trump was targeting people in more rural areas, he likely paid less per ad to reach those people. That prompted a tweet from Brad Parscale, the Trump campaign\u2019s digital director in the 2016 campaign, who was quick to take credit for the efficiency and claiming that he was sure their ads were at least 100 times cheaper. Clinton said the unfair nature of the system needed to be analyzed.

The proposal, written by Ellen Weintraub, a Democrat and vice chair of the commission, would require online advertisements to carry the same disclaimers from their sponsors as do radio, television and print ads. The commission will consider the framework, known as a notice of proposed rule making, at its next public hearing on March 8.  The move comes as tech companies face growing scrutiny in Washington ranging from concerns about market dominance to concerns that online platforms are used for sex trafficking of children.  Congress has been examining how Russians used social media platforms to influence the 2016 election, and bipartisan bills have been introduced in both the House and Senate that would require companies like Facebook and Google to disclose information about sponsors of political ads on their sites, including how much they\u2019re spending and what audiences the ads are focusing on.    FEC Disclaimers  Though the FEC proposal, which was shared by Weintraub, would apply to campaigns, political parties and other organizations that try to influence federal elections, tech companies could also be affected. They might have to adapt their platforms to accommodate the kind of disclaimers the FEC envisions.  In 2011, Facebook asked the FEC for an exemption from disclaimer rules because its ads used a \"sponsored\" tag that did not identify the sponsor, and did not necessarily link back to the sponsor\u2019s website. The election commission deadlocked on granting an exemption.  In the wake of revelations that Facebook, Google and other online sites were used by Russians in 2015 and 2016 to influence Americans on hot button social and political issues, the FEC reopened the rule making process to require more disclosure for online ads. The draft rule would require text and graphic ads to include the name of a sponsor \"in letters of sufficient size to be clearly readable.\"  Political ads on streaming music services or Internet radio stations would have to include oral disclaimers, while candidates buying online video and audio ads would have to state their names and add, \"And I approve of this message.\"  Paid Advertisements  The notice also seeks input on whether political organizations that use free services -- like uploading videos to YouTube -- should be required to say they are responsible for the ads. Under current law, disclaimers are only required on paid advertisements.  The notice, which will require the support of Republican commissioners to be adopted, also tries to anticipate how developing technologies, including virtual and augmented reality, should be regulated.  The last time the FEC issued a ruling on internet advertising was in 2006, the year after YouTube was founded. That ruling required individuals and committees buying online political ads to disclose how much they spent on the ads. It also called for a disclaimer for all \"paid Internet advertising placed on another person\u2019s website,\" such as banner ads. The requirement exempted other forms of Internet communications, such as blog posts.  The six-member commission, which enforces election laws, can include no more than three members from one party. Currently there are three Republicans, one Democrat and one independent. Lee Goodman, a Republican, is stepping down Friday, which will create two vacancies.

It's meant to be useful to special effects artists and anybody else working in film or virtual reality \u2014 \"flicks\" cleanly divide each frame in a movie, TV show, or video game in an easy-to-read, easy-to-use number.  Facebook has invented a new unit of time: The \"flick,\" equivalent to precisely one 705,600,000th of a second \u2014 larger than a nanosecond, and smaller than a microsecond.  It's short for \"frame tick,\" hinting at its cinematic origins, writes original inventor Christopher Horvath on GitHub.  As for why Facebook needs a new unit of time, it goes back to the social network's Oculus VR subsidiary and its larger bet on virtual reality. And for Horvath, formerly of the cinematic world at firms like Pixar, Weta Digital, and Industrial Light & Magic, it seems to have been something of a passion project.  In film, video games, and any other kind of visual, screen-based medium, creators have to think in split-seconds. Most movies, for instance, are shot at 24 frames per second, which means that the film displays 24 still images every second in a rapid sequence to give the illusion of motion.  The problem, as described by Horvath, is that the math gets messy when you try to work on one frame at a time. At 24 frames per second, or FPS, each frame is approximately .04166666667 seconds long, or 41666666.669 nanoseconds. Those numbers are inelegant, with endlessly repeating decimals. In turn, that can make life difficult for programmers and artists who are trying to work precisely at these scales.  That's where the Facebook flick comes in. It can represent a single frame at a nice, even number, at a whole variety of framerates. For instance, at the 24 FPS of most movies, each frame is 29,400,000 flicks. At 60 FPS, seen as a desirable framerate for action-packed video games, each frame is 11,760,000 flicks long. It's a clean number that can easily be divided or added up, without worrying about decimal points.  Facebook has actually released its documentation for the creation and use of flicks as open source, meaning that anybody can download it and add support for the unit into their own software. That, in turn, means that flicks could become a standard unit of time \u2014 if not on your wristwatch, then in the visual arts.", "stock": "FB", "label": 1, "date": "2018-01-22", "source": "business-insider", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-invents-flicks-time-measurement-2018-1"}, {"article": "This story was delivered to BI Intelligence \"Digital Media Briefing\" subscribers hours before appearing on Business Insider.

Current users may be exposed to more Watch videos with Facebook's News Feed tweaks. Morgan Stanley's survey didn't include data on average time spent viewing Facebook Watch, but Watch video engagement could increase as Facebook prioritizes longer serialized content in the News Feed. This can help offset declining video views caused by Facebook's recently announced News Feed algorithm tweak, which de-prioritizes publisher content.  But Watch has a long way to go to catch up with YouTube viewership. Seventy-eight percent of respondents indicated they used YouTube in the past year, while this figure was just 43% for Facebook Watch. That's not surprising, as YouTube has been around since 2005 and claims over 1 billion daily video views. Nonetheless, the adoption figures of Watch indicate Facebook is achieving its goal of converting more of its users into \"lean-back\" video viewers, as opposed to users who passively consume short-form video in the News Feed. Facebook is poised to boost Watch viewership as it broadens its exclusive TV-like content library.

Wieser, one of Facebook's biggest bears on Wall Street, has a $152 price target for the stock, about 16.5% below its current level of $177. The Wall Street consensus is at $224, according to Bloomberg data.  \"With every passing year, Facebook gets closer to the limits of growth,\" Wieser told Business Insider. He says most mature companies hit a plateau and see lower margins.  \"Look at Google,\" he added, comparing Facebook to the search giant, which is another mature tech company reliant on advertising revenue that may be plateauing. Google's fourth-quarter profit margin was 24%, compared with 25% for the same quarters in 2015 and 2016.  Wieser says, \"Facebook is overvalued,\" and that there are \"limits on growth which the investor community doesn't fully appreciate.\" Those limits pertain directly to the advertising dollars that brands will want to spend on Facebook in the near future.  \"Spending will further be impacted by practical limits to growth in budgets for advertising,\" Wieser wrote in a recent note. He added advertising spending \"remains as a key concern on the growth potential for digital media companies.\"  Furthermore, Facebook has been in the thick of a public debate concerning fake news. That has caused huge brands like Unilever to think about scaling back their ad spending on the platform.  Unilever Chief Marketing Officer Keith Weed threatened to withdraw some of his company's advertising budget from platforms like Facebook and Google, favoring \"responsible platforms,\" with \"responsible content.\"  But, according to Wieser, Unilever will continue its ad spending on Facebook if the company cleans up its content. \"Unilever will stay the course so long as Facebook, Google and others continue to make efforts to improve their platforms,\" he said.  The advertising industry, however, doesn't see those concerns as a real threat to Facebook's ad revenue. There are few alternatives for marketers, many in the industry say.

Walmart and McDonald's may have negative effects on society, according to a new survey of 2,000 Americans, but Facebook beats them both.

The studies have managed to show the two factors aren't just correlated; social media appears to lead to negatives feelings.  \"Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg, initially dismissed some of these concerns as a 'crazy idea' and instead tried promote the benefits of his social network,\" McGinn wrote. In defense, Zuckerberg also recently claimed people were spending 50 million fewer hours on Facebook due to various changes to the site.  \"But eventually, public opinion and dissatisfaction grew too loud to ignore,\" McGinn wrote.  A separate survey asking people which tech companies had negative effects on society found Facebook was the most common answer, followed closely by Twitter. Google, Netflix, and LinkedIn fell much further behind.  However, \"None of the above\" was still the most popular response overall, selected by 53% of people, perhaps suggesting the public outrage at tech companies has yet to hit its peak.", "stock": "FB", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-01", "source": "business-insider", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-worse-for-society-than-walmart-or-mcdonalds-survey-2018-2"}, {"article": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Drew Angerer/Getty Images  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg discussed Facebook's role in society on the 'Freakonomics Radio' podcast.  Zuckerberg said his original goal was for Facebook to spread openness and foster connection among users. But concerns over misinformation and tech addiction have arisen.  The interview comes amid a growing chorus of backlash against big tech companies.  Amid a growing backlash over how big tech companies are impacting society, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the world is more divided than he ever anticipated.  \"We'\u0092ve been focused on making the world more open and connected,\" Zuckerberg said on a recent episode of the 'Freakonomics Radio' podcast.\u0094 \"And I always thought that that would be enough to solve a lot of problems by itself.\"  Zuckerberg told the show's host, Stephen Dubner, that \"the world is today more divided than I would have expected for the level of openness and connection that we have today.\"  Facebook has come under fire from people in and outside of the tech world due to issues of tech addiction and the platform's role in spreading misinformation during the contentious 2016 election. Since then, the social network has instituted a series of changes to its news feed that have actually reduced the total time users spend on the site by up to 50 million hours per day.  Zuckerberg told Dubner that Facebook, in his view, has a responsibility to work on connecting people across ideological divides. He said that while he believes most people mean to do well by each other, \"confronting truths or perspectives that don'\u0092t fit with ours\" can cause people to lash out.  In Zuckerberg's view, social networks like Facebook should provide a productive starting point for discussion by helping people bond over things they have in common.  There are \"lots of different issues and things that help bind people together,\" Zuckerberg said, including a well-functioning economy and the jobs it provides. To help boost economic opportunity around the world, he said, Facebook is working to spread the internet \u2014 and the opportunity for new jobs and connections it brings \u2014 to underserved communities. Of course, that would also lead to more new Facebook users.  The interview is part of a six-part series called the 'Secret Life of CEOs' on 'Freakonomics Radio.'

Attn: CEO Matthew Segal tells Business Insider that Facebook is emphasizing loyal audiences, interactivity, and longer episodes.  Starting in the fall, Facebook began to greenlight a handful of second seasons for its TV-like \"Watch\" shows. And now \"We Need to Talk,\" Attn:'s relationship advice series starring Nev Schulman (of \"Catfish\" fame) and his wife Laura Perlongo, has gotten a 10-episode order.  Business Insider talked to Attn: CEO Matthew Segal about what it took to get a renewal from Facebook, which has been selective about the series that have made it past season one. Segal said the most important factor was this: \"a loyal, repeat audience.\"  \"I know it's something that Facebook's looking at,\" Segal explained. \"Can viewers return from one episode to the next in the habitual way that implies fandom.\"  This makes sense when you consider what Facebook wants Watch to be. The tech giant is focused on making the Watch tab something that doesn't just rely on the same behavior as the news feed. Facebook wants people to check back for new episodes, like they do on YouTube or traditional TV. (One Watch partner told Business Insider that Facebook would prefer a show with fewer \"views,\" if the audience were coming back week after week, and didn't rely on the virality of a particular episode.)  Talk to your viewers  Segal said the other big factor was the \"interactivity\" of a show. This leans into Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's new mandate of promoting meaningful interactions.  \"Before we went into production on season one, we had Nev and Laura ask people\" what dating topics to cover, Segal said. And in season two, Attn: is going deeper into the fan feedback aspect.  \"For season two it's going to be even more interactive,\" Segal said. \"We are literally going to ask users to comment on their own experiences, and advice.\" Segal said the hosts will ask the audience about topics like how to ask people out, changing gender roles, money troubles, and so on. And there will be segments on the show when Nev and Laura are responding to reader feedback in real-time (though the episodes won't be live).  \"We Need to Talk\" isn't the only show that has used interactivity to find success.  According to a Watch partner, Mike Rowe's show \"Returning the Favor\" has been used by Facebook as an example of a show that's doing really well. Rowe asks for fan feedback on every show. \"We've already proven the best way to get people interested in RTF is to ask them to program each episode,\" he recently told Tubefilter.  Simply bigger  Season two of \"We Need to Talk\" will also be longer, with episodes falling more in the 10-12 minute range versus 3-6 minutes.  \"We've hired a whole writers room for this season, and there's lot of jokes peppered in,\" Segal said, though some of the show is unscripted as well.  There is definitely a bigger budget for this season, though Segal didn't comment on the exact figure. But in general, Facebook seems to be throwing more funding at shows it thinks can move the needle in terms of repeat viewers and interactivity.

Facebook doesn't have much incentive to listen.  The company is already reticent about being seen as a media company and is moving away from the news business.  Media companies don't have a ton of leverage over Facebook or Google.  Plus the technological challenges involved in either getting paid or choking off Facebook are significant.  The newsrooms at the 'old media' Wall Street Journal and 'digital native' BuzzFeed may not see eye-to-eye on much, but suddenly their bosses have lots to bond over.  That's because, in one way or another, both News Corp. chairman Rupert Murdoch and BuzzFeed CEO Jonah Peretti believe that Facebook and Google aren't giving news organizations a fair deal. They want them to pay up for news stories shared on the platforms.  In each case, however, it's not clear whether any single news organization has serious leverage against the duopoly, or, as Business Insider's Nathan McAlone noted, the technical wherewithal to actually pull or block all of their content from either platform.  Still, it's not crazy to think that Facebook, in particular, could and probably should pay publishers to distribute their content. But who says they care enough or see what's in it for them?  Why should Facebook listen to Rupert Murdoch?  Murdoch doesn't make any explicit threats in his fiery note. It's easy to see why. What threat could he make? Could he pull down the New York Post's Facebook page tomorrow? Would people notice or care? This isn't like MTV going dark on a cable system in the 1990s, which would inevitably lead to fans calling their cable switchboard to complain.  More importantly, Murdoch couldn't stop people from posting New York Post articles to Facebook, could it? I asked Gabriele Boland, manager of content strategy at the social media analytics firm News Whip, and she said she's not sure how they would.Making links 'not shareable' is one potential way but that seems counterproductive. Publishers want people passing around their stories. One way to go would be for the New York Post to charge for everything,  \"A news site could extremely limit its own Facebook traffic by \"pay-walling\" their content,\" Boland said, noting that even a fully pay-walled property like the Financial Times still racks up tons of engagement on Facebook.  Ok, what about the idea that Facebook needs good content, that it's part of the reason people like hanging out there?  \"The publishers are obviously enhancing the value and integrity of Facebook through their news and content but are not being adequately rewarded for those services,\" Murdoch wrote on Monday.  Maybe this is true. But if anything, the tech giant seems to want to make news go away on Facebook, rather the get further into bed with it.  Murdoch has talked tough about this before  Back in 2009, Murdoch talked about blocking all of his company's news stories from Google search entirely. He had support in the \"Google is bad for news\" camp. Around that time, noted mogul Mark Cuban (\"Shark Tank\") called Google a \"vampire.\"  There was even industry chatter - believe it or not - that a bunch of news organizations could ban together and pull their content from Google searches in favor or Microsoft's Bing.  But alas, nobody went through with it, as it was likely way too scary to give up the traffic Google searches deliver.  The same kind of fears would be top of mind for anyone mulling a full Facebook boycott.  Here's the case for paying publishers, besides being a nice thing for the world  If you think about it, an exclusive programmed, strategy is exactly what Facebook is trying to do with Facebook Watch, where only partner companies can upload video and some are being paid by Facebook to do so. Thus it's not outside the realm of possibility that Facebook could do the same for news.  This kind of members-only approach could keep Facebook out of trouble. It would be an abrupt change, but what if you could only find content on Facebook from an approved set of limited, vetted partners?  This could be seen as a vital, pro-journalism, pro-democracy gesture by Facebook (which, you may recall, has recently had some unwanted meetings with Congress over its anti-democracy impact). And it could keep the company out of more fake news trouble in 2020.  Plus, Murdoch's right. It really wouldn't cost that much. \"Carriage payments would have a minor impact on Facebook's profits,\" he wrote. For a company that pulls in $10 billion-plus in revenue a quarter, a few checks to some newspapers is pocket change for Zuckerberg.  The case against paying is that it makes Facebook a media company  Facebook is by nature open. It's that Silicon Valley utopian ideal that makes Facebook Facebook. Do they really want to change that? \"At our heart we're a tech company,\" COO Sheryl Sandberg told Axios last October.  After all, people like what they like, whether its fake news or mean stories about Trump. Who is Facebook to say they can't share conspiracy theories or the like?  Allison Shelley/Getty Images  Plus, does Facebook want to manage another few hundred publisher relationships on top of what it's doing with Watch? At least with Watch, the promise is hitting Google's YouTube where it hurts and ultimately stealing some TV ad budgets. Watch is a relatively small project (Facebook is spending about $1 billion on it).  Becoming the Internet's curated newsstand (Facebook Read anyone?) is a whole other level. It makes Facebook a media distributor much like Comcast. Which is exactly where it doesn't want to be.  Lastly, paying a select group of publishers probably won't do much for Facebook's bottom line. And that's usually the bottom line.", "stock": "FB", "label": 1, "date": "2018-01-22", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/rupert-murdoch-may-be-right-about-facebook-paying-media-companies-2018-1"}, {"article": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg delivers the keynote address at Facebook's F8 Developer Conference on April 18, 2017 at McEnery Convention Center in San Jose, California. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images  Facebook is now directing users to download a VPN called Onavo for \"protection.\"  The VPN is owned by Facebook, and sends information about your app usage habits to the company.  Facebook has used this tool for a competitive advantage against other mobile apps.  Critics say Facebook isn't clear enough about its ownership of Onavo.  Under the pretense of protecting your account, Facebook is telling users download to a Facebook-owned app that tracks what you do on your phone \u2014 and sends that information back to Facebook.  TechCrunch first noticed on Tuesday that Facebook added a menu item, called \"protect,\" to its iPhone and iOS app. Clicking it takes users directly to the App Store listing of a Virtual Private Network (VPN) app called Onavo Protect, which is owned by Facebook.  Facebook bought Onavo, an Israeli company, in 2013. Since then, Facebook has been using the data collected from the service to keep tabs on how people use the apps on their phones, even when they're not using Facebook.  For example, the company used Onavo to see that Snapchat saw declining usage after Facebook introduced the competing Instagram Stories feature, The Wall Street Journal reported. It was also data from Onavo that reportedly inspired Facebook to launch a group video chat feature to its Messenger app\u2014 stymying a smaller app called Houseparty, which provided a very similar feature.  However, critics say that Facebook isn't clear enough about its affiliation with Onavo, implying that users might never know that the company uses the data from the app for such purposes.  Facebook did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment. Erez Naveh, Product Manager at Onavo, told TechCrunch that the app collects mobile data traffic to \"help us recognize tactics that bad actors use.\" Naveh also noted that the app lets people know it collects data before users download it.  Here's what Onavo actually does \u2014 and why people are upset that Facebook is pushing it.  Facebook's Onavo is a Virtual Private Network, or VPN  Onavo is a Virtual Private Network, or a VPN.  There are several VPNs out there, and they essentially all do the same thing: route your internet traffic through a third-party server.  Facebook's iOS app now displays a \"protect\" option that links directly to Onavo's App Store listing. Screenshot  This allows users to to mask their browsing activity from Internet Service Providers, like Comcast and AT&T. It can also make your computer look like it's in a different location, depending on where the third-party server is. Typically, VPNs themselves encrypt your traffic, making it harder for people to snoop on your activity.  Many VPNs are paid services \u2014 the popular AnchorFree Hotspot Shield, for instance, charges $13 a month, or $120 a year. Others, like Onavo Protect, are totally free for (mostly) unlimited usage.  When users download Onavo, they give Facebook permission to collect their mobile data traffic. Because Facebook owns Onavo, Facebook gets access to that data. This means that while your ISP won't see what apps you're using, Facebook will. If you're using Onavo, and you spend two hours on Twitter a day, Facebook can see that.  Why does this have people worried?  The major criticism of Onavo Protect is that Facebook isn't clear enough about its affiliation with the app. Unless you tap the \"Read More\" button in the App Store description of Onavo, you might never know it was actually owned by Facebook itself.  \"As part of this process, Onavo collects your mobile data traffic. This helps us improve and operate the Onavo service by analyzing your use of websites, apps and data. Because we're part of Facebook, we also use this info to improve Facebook products and services, gain insights into the products and services people value, and build better experiences,\" the description of the app reads.  The average user may not read the entire app description and download the service without knowing that it is giving Facebook access to your mobile browsing data, say critics.  John Gruber, a prominent Apple blogger, called Onavo \"spyware,\" likening it malicious software that hackers deploy to spy on users. Dell Cameron, a reporter at Gizmodo, called the VPN service \"vampiric\" and told readers not to download the app.  Facebook already has issues with eroding public trust, amid its public struggles with fake news, propaganda, and misinformation spreading through the social network. The perception that the company is pushing what's seen as a way to spy on users may not be the best look.", "stock": "FB", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-14", "source": "business-insider", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-facebooks-onavo-protect-virtual-private-network-app-2018-2"}, {"article": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.

That\u2019s the way you match with someone on Tinder. You like them, they like you, you both find out and get connected. But to date, the feature\u2019s largely been trapped in dating apps that match you with randos or that not everyone wants to be on. That means this anti-loneliness technology is leaving some people out.  Facebook, meanwhile, is on a newfound quest to stimulate \u201cmeaningful interactions,\u201d not just passive content consumption. Its latest attempt is a ham-handed Meetups feature. It surfaces big groups of friends saying some might want to hang out with you, and asking if you\u2019re interested. If you both say yes, it connects you over Messenger.  The idea behind Meetups is smart, but the execution is a mess. Because Meetups ambiguously shows multiple people at once, sends aggressive notifications to participate and encompasses all kinds of relationships, the results are meaningless. You don\u2019t know if someone \u201cchose you\u201d because they actually like you, want to chill platonically, actually were approving of another friend shown at the same time or were just mindlessly clicking through after getting an alert to try the confusing feature.  For years I\u2019ve been writing about how Facebook and Messenger should build an offline availability indicator for finding out who\u2019s free to spend time with in person. Messenger\u2019s new test of \u201cYour Emoji,\u201d where you can put a beer mug, or dinner plate, or briefcase on your profile pic for 24 hours to indicate what you\u2019re up to or interested in doing, is a much better approach.  But it\u2019s not designed for dating. And let\u2019s be real. Finding a significant other is the source of some of the most meaningful interactions you\u2019ll ever have. If Facebook can be the matchmaker, it will accomplish its mission while earning tremendous good will from those paired up. And unlike dating apps that become needless to people once they successfully get into a relationship, it doesn\u2019t matter to Facebook if you never use the feature again.  That\u2019s why Facebook should build a \u201cMatchmaker\u201d feature into its profiles.  It\u2019d be completely voluntary from the start. If you\u2019re romantically interested in someone, you could hit a button on their profile that they\u2019ve opted in to displaying. If they hit the button on yours too, Facebook lets you both know.  Here\u2019s the tricky part, or technically, the simple part. Facebook shouldn\u2019t blast you with tons of notifications teasing that someone likes you. It shouldn\u2019t try to get you to guess who it was from a short-list of people. And it shouldn\u2019t push you to swipe through all your friends. It should be subtle. Otherwise, some users, especially women who typically get the majority of inbound interest from men on dating apps, may feel pestered, ogled or even objectified. That\u2019s why many people stray away from sleazy dating apps like Bang With Friends that try to match you via your social graph.  Some will surely cringe at the idea of Facebook getting more deeply involved with our romantic lives. Others might think it\u2019s redundant with Pokes, walls, messages and other ways to connect, even though those are either unclear signals or lack the privacy and protection against unwanted advances of double opt-in. And, understandably, some just wouldn\u2019t want to mix romance into a friendship platform. There\u2019s certainly the risk of creepy dudes following up via message like \u201cI right-swiped you\u2026\u201d Getting this wrong could drive people away from Facebook all together.  But done right, Facebook Matchmaker would hardly exist for anyone who doesn\u2019t want it. It wouldn\u2019t generate tons of unrequited \u201cYes\u201d swipes. And it\u2019d only result in rare matches. But those matches would be meaningful, because they weren\u2019t coerced, and they didn\u2019t occur on an app designed for finding one-night hookups. They\u2019d be people from whom you already accepted friend requests, in your network, with whom you might already have a lot in common.  I\u2019m increasingly hearing from friends over 30 that they\u2019re anxious they won\u2019t ever find a partner. But we\u2019ve lost many of the other cultural institutions that used to pair us up 100 years ago.  Globalization of opportunity leads people to leave their home towns. Secularization and the rise of science mean fewer people are connected through places of worship. Multi-generational housing has fallen out of fashion so young adults don\u2019t live with parents and grandparents who could match them with a partner. The positive shift toward women pursuing their own careers leads some to push marriage to later in life. People are spending longer on higher education and prioritizing jobs over family.  And now when we feel lonely, when we might have sought in-person companionship, we have phones full of feeds, memes and games to keep us company.  Facebook\u2019s made it easier than ever to \u201cfeel connected,\u201d endlessly scrolling through friends\u2019 photos, while actually allowing us to isolate ourselves.

Desperate for the referral traffic Facebook dangled, they spent the past few years jumping through its hoops only to be cut out of the equation. Instead of developing an owned audience of homepage visitors and newsletter subscribers, they let Facebook brainwash readers into thinking it was their source of information.  Now Facebook is pushing into local news, but publishers should be wary of making the same crooked deal. It might provide more exposure and traffic for smaller outlets today, but it could teach users they only need to visit Facebook for local news in the future. Here\u2019s how Facebook retrained us over the past 12 years to drain the dollars out of news.  Users first is Facebook first later  To be clear, Facebook\u2019s intention, that I believe to be earnest, is to foster stronger ties between its users and their communities to boost well-being. But that doesn\u2019t mean ripple effects are positive. The critical lens through which to view all of Facebook\u2019s strategy is that in the short term it puts users first, itself second and everyone else a distant, distant third. That includes developers, advertisers and definitely news publishers.  This strategy is actually self-serving in the long term, though, because Facebook only continues to dominate because its users don\u2019t leave. Back in 2010, Facebook decimated the virality of game developers like Zynga, which made lots of money because their News Feed spam threatened to push people away from the social network. That short-term hit to the bottom line paved the way for the depth of engagement that fuels quarters where Facebook earns $4 billion today.  This explains CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s recent announcement that Facebook would make changes to enhance well-being even if it decreased time spent on the site or its ad revenue. Those consequences may be true in the short term. But it\u2019s a shrewd tactic when you zoom out. Left unchecked, the \u201cTime Well Spent\u201d movement could metastasize into a \u201cTime to leave Facebook\u201d movement. Better to trade away a few minutes per day per user now to keep those users for years to come.  Retraining news readers  When Facebook started, there was no feed. You browsed from profile to profile to check up on friends. News Feed\u2019s launch in 2006 retrained users to just go to the Facebook home page where everything would come to you. Brands followed, investing to build an audience through Facebook\u2019s churning stream of content.  As Facebook\u2019s users shifted from PCs and Macs to Androids and iPhones, the company struck upon an enduring format for mobile. Desktop computers had big enough screens to accomodate multiple windows, and switching between browser tabs was quick, allowing users to easily hop between different sites. But on mobile with tiny screens, low quality app, poor connections, slow-loading sites, people seized upon Facebook\u2019s single app that pulled together content from everywhere. Facebook began to train us to keep scrolling rather than struggle to bounce around.  In 2011, when Facebook first took notice of Twitter, it launched its public figure Subscribe feature and news links gained more visibility in the feed. By 2014, \u201cFacebook the big news machine\u201d was in full swing with Trending, hashtags and news outlets pouring resources into growing their Pages. Emphasizing the \u201cnews\u201d in News Feed retrained users to wait for the big world-changing headlines to come to them rather than crisscrossing the home pages of various publishers. Many don\u2019t even click-through, getting the gist of the news just from the headline and preview blurb. Advertisers followed the eyeballs, moving their spend from the publisher sites to Facebook.  In 2015, Facebook realized users hated waiting for slow mobile websites to load, so it launched Instant Articles to host publisher content within its own app. Instant Articles trained users not to even visit news sites when they clicked their links, instead only having the patience for a fast-loading native page stripped of the publisher\u2019s identity and many of their recirculation and monetization opportunities. Advertisers followed, as publishers allowed Facebook to sell the ads on Instant Articles for them and thereby surrendered their advertiser relationships at the same time as their reader relationships.  This is how Facebook turns publishers into ghostwriters, a problem I blew the whistle on in 2015. Publishers are pitted against each other as they make interchangeable \u201cdumb content\u201d for Facebook\u2019s \u201csmart pipes.\u201d  Publishers wisely began pushing back, demanding more layout and monetization flexibility, and many abandoned the platform in favor of Google\u2019s less prescriptive AMP platform for fast-loading mobile pages. In fact, 38 of 72 Instant Articles launch partner publications including the New York Times and Washington Post have ditched the Facebook controlled format according to a study by Columbia Journalism Review.  Still, publishers have few major sources of traffic outside of Facebook and Google Search. With the death of Google Reader and Twitter\u2019s move to an algorithmic feed, there\u2019s still no at-scale, unfiltered place to share or follow news. If people do want a more direct relationship with news, they should get on Feedly or another RSS readers, or add a few favorite sites to their browser\u2019s bookmark bar.  Meanwhile, Facebook\u2019s only goal remains to provide value to users, and when it comes to content, it doesn\u2019t really care which publisher provides it as long as it\u2019s high-quality.  Siphoning resources to the center  Again and again, Facebook has centralized attention typically spread across the web. A few years back I wrote about \u201c20 New Ways Facebook Is Eating The Internet,\u201d and its appetite has only grown. It\u2019s trying to do the same with Watch (YouTube), Marketplace (Craigslist and eBay) and many other features. It\u2019s a smart plan that ends up arguably improving the experience for individual users \u2014 or at least offering new options while making Facebook more essential and much richer.  The problem is that for society as a whole, this leads to a demonetization and eventual defunding of some news publishers, content creators and utility providers while simultaneously making them heavily reliant on Facebook. This gives Facebook the power to decide what types of content, what topics, and what sources are important. Even if Facebook believes itself to be a neutral tech platform, it implicitly plays the role of media company as its values define the feed. Having a single editor\u2019s fallible algorithms determine the news consumption of the wired world is a precarious situation.  The business side is just as troubling. As Ben Thompson of Stratechery has described, advertisers are abandoning news sites and aggregating to Facebook where they can more efficiently target their exact customers, where they go every day. Why advertise on an intermediary news site when businesses can go straight to well of attention. Without the massive scale and adtech, individual publishers can\u2019t compete for dollars.  But if they resist working with Facebook and providing their content there, another publisher will happily bring the same stories to the social network in return for the short-term traffic boost. There\u2019s always someone else willing to offer up dumb content to the smart pipe.  Steamrolled by strategy change  And the real problem only manifests when Facebook shifts directions. Its comes to the conclusion that users want to see more video, so the format gets more visibility in the News Feed. Soon, publishers scramble to pivot to video, hiring teams and buying expensive equipment so they can blast the content on Facebook rather than thinking about their loyal site visitors. But then Facebook decides too much passive video is bad for you or isn\u2019t interesting, so its News Feed visibility is curtailed, and publishers have wasted their resources and time chasing a white rabbit\u2026 or, in this case, a blue one.  This happened to Page tab apps like musician profile provider BandPage, which was the No. 2 app on Facebook until Facebook banned default landing tabs. The startup lost 90 percent of its traffic after wasting years chasing Facebook\u2019s changes, and eventually sold for $8 million after raising $27 million. Open Graph news reader apps met the same fate, built by publishers to meet the opportunity of Facebook\u2019s short-lived Ticker and \u201cJosh read [clickbait article] on Washington Post Social Reader\u201d stories.  Publishers are currently caught amidst of another massive Facebook strategy change. It\u2019s now striving to offset Russian election interference, fake news for profit, allegations of political bias, polarized society, the explosion of viral video, the absence of friends, and fears that too much scrolling hurts our well-being. That\u2019s led to Facebook proclaiming it will remove 20% of news from the News Feed as it prioritizes content that\u2019s not just meaningful, but stimulates meaningful interactions between users.  On this week\u2019s Q4 2017 earnings call, Zuckerberg said Facebook had already tweaked its algorithm to show fewer viral videos and optimize well-being. The result was a 50 million hours per day reduction in Facebook use, which translates to 2.14 minutes per daily user, or 5 percent of total time spent on Facebook. The company was willing to go so far as to make changes that led to its slowest ever user growth rate, and its first decline in total users anywhere as the U.S. & Canada region actually lost 700,000 Facebookers.  Yet it\u2019s the video makers and news publishers who will pay for this pivot of purpose. Facebook\u2019s revenue still reached a record $12.97 billion, and investors still boosted its share price higher. In fact, Facebook could actually earn money or at least break even from the \u201cTime Well Spent\u201d changes.  By decreasing total time spent but raising the quality of content people see, Facebook ends up with fewer total ad impressions but higher engagement rates as people are retrained to skip less of what they see. Advertisers still eager to reach its massive audience will compete in Facebook\u2019s ad auctions, paying higher prices. Facebook has the cash reserves and momentum to weather the short-term monetization drop in exchange for a healthier long-term future. Content creators are left trying to make ends meet.  [Update 2/4/2018: Zuckerberg discussed Facebook\u2019s ability to persevere despite mistakes in his post about the company\u2019s 14th birthday. \u201cOver the years I\u2019ve made almost every mistake you can imagine . . . I\u2019ve missed important trends and I\u2019ve been slow to others. I\u2019ve launched product after product that failed. The reason our community exists today is not because we avoid mistakes. It\u2019s because we believe what we\u2019re doing matters enough to keep trying\u201d. The issue is that other less secure and successful businesses like newsrooms don\u2019t have the resources to undertake trial and error at the scale necessary to keep up with Facebook\u2019s changes.]  Stay the course  And now local news site are facing the start of this dangerous cycle. Facebook says it will show more local news in the News Feed. It\u2019s testing a \u201cToday in\u201d local news digest in several cities. It\u2019s prioritizing content people discuss instead of passively consume. And Facebook is pushing its new mission to rebuild communities and Bring the World Closer Together that aligns with local news.  Sounds great, right? There\u2019s no doubt there\u2019s an opportunity here for local news outlets. But the key to keeping their boats afloat is not completely changing course to follow Facebook\u2019s siren call. Whether or not you think the company is purposefully trying to destroy the industries it invades or just modernize them to benefit users, publishers must meet Facebook with skepticism.  Facebook\u2019s next retraining appears to be that it\u2019s the best place to get local news, not your local newspaper or blog. It might happily display all the headlines with little encouragement for readers to click through, as it does with Today On. It might make images and videos load faster than they do on local sites. And they might bundle local news with Facebook Events and reviews of nearby places using personalization local sites can\u2019t match.  That might be good for the reader, and thereby for Facebook long term, but it\u2019s dangerous for the publishers. Facebook doesn\u2019t even have to purposefully poach advertisers from local sites, they\u2019ll just flow to it naturally as it becomes the local news destination.  They should still focus on turning occasional readers into repeat homepage visitors that bookmark the site and return frequently. They should track analytics about what kinds of stories those loyalists want, rather than the ones that might drive occasional traffic spikes of fly-by readers. They should invest in developing their own ad technology or partnering with more neutral third-party providers. And they should keep pushing email newsletter, event and subscription signups.  That\u2019s because there\u2019s no telling when Facebook\u2019s strategy around what users want or how to give it to them will change. Again, Facebook wants users to be informed and entertained, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily care how or by whom. And let\u2019s not forget that Facebook is quietly building up its Marketplace peer-to-peer selling feature in another part of its app to be the ultimate replacement for the classified ads that used to keep local news sites afloat.  Unfortunately, big, well-funded publishers staffed with true tech talent haven\u2019t been able to gracefully navigate the constantly changing playing field set by Facebook. So what hope do smaller outlets without the technological or strategic prowess hope to have?  In Zuckerberg\u2019s hometown of Dobbs Ferry, NY, there\u2019s a beloved newspaper called The Rivertowns Enterprise. It\u2019s a destination for those seeking local news, with a loyal following for both its website and its weekly print edition, which many who grew up there get delivered to their homes around the country. Visit its site and you\u2019ll stumble across a variety of stories about city politics, high school sports and Main Street businesses that also advertise there.  But as Facebook turns its eyes toward local news as an answer to larger problems with well-being, false information and polarized communities, it also poses a threat to The Rivertowns Enterprise and outlets like it. The inevitable march of technological progress was merely accelerated by the dominant social network. But for now those publishers\u2019 best bet is to take a page from Facebook if they\u2019re going to survive: Put your own readers and your long-term viability first instead of gambling on short-lived favors.", "stock": "FB", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-03", "source": "techcrunch", "url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/02/03/facebooks-siren-call/"}, {"article": "Facebook is looking to clean up and clarify the way advertisers measure their campaign performance.  Over the past couple of years, the company has had to acknowledge multiple mistakes in its ad metrics. Last fall, researchers even pointed out that Facebook\u2019s purported reach was greater than the US Census population in every state.  So making these kinds of tweaks (and taking other steps to increase transparency) could help restore advertisers\u2019 confidence in the company\u2019s numbers.  Facebook laid out the changes in a blog post, and also at a press event this morning, where Vice President of Marketing Science Brad Smallwood was joined by Edward Gaffney, director of implementation research at ad agency GroupM. (Gaffney is part of Facebook\u2019s Measurement Council.)  The first change comes in the way these metrics will be labelled. Facebook will now explicitly point out when an ad metric is an estimate, in development, or both.  Gaffney said that advertisers are used to working with estimates, but he recalled that even in the Measurement Council, there was some uncertainty around which numbers were estimated versus directly measured. So this kind of clarity is needed \u201cto understand that an estimate is just that \u2014 it\u2019s better than a guess, but it is not the absolute truth.\u201d  Meanwhile, Smallwood said that it\u2019s natural for Facebook to experiment with the most effective ways to present its data. By labeling a measurement as in development, the company is telling advertisers to expect those measurements to change. (As Gaffney put it: \u201cDon\u2019t build a complex model around that.\u201d)  Some of the metrics might eventually disappear entirely if they\u2019re not helpful to advertisers. In fact, Smallwood said Facebook plans to remove 20 of them in July because they were judged redundant, outdated, not actionable or infrequently used.  For example, he said the social reach metric (which shows how often people saw an ad accompanied with context like a comment from their friend) turned out to be not that different from a standard reach metric, and advertisers didn\u2019t know how to use the data to improve their campaigns. So it\u2019s getting cut.  Lastly, Smallwood said Facebook will be launching a new initiative called Measure What Matters, combining in-person events, online events and online content to help advertisers understand more about how to measure and improve their campaigns.", "stock": "FB", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-22", "source": "techcrunch", "url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/02/22/facebook-ad-metrics/"}, {"article": "At least one Facebook employee has been interviewed by special counsel Robert Mueller as part of his investigation into potential Russian interference with the 2016 election, reports Wired.

For a major spender on social media, which that campaign certainly was, it is common for Facebook, Google, Twitter, and other properties selling ads to have a liaison with the client.  Since Facebook is also up to its eyes on Russia-related inquiries, it makes perfect sense that someone acting as go-between or advisor for the company and the campaign would be interviewed as a matter of course. Certainly no wrongdoing is implied.

The Boston-based startup will shut down as both its team and technology are rolled into Facebook, where it could help users who are locked out of their accounts.  Confirm.io had raised at least $4 million from investors, including Cava Capital, since launching three years ago. The 2015 seed round funded advanced forensics used to pull information from an ID card, as well as mobile biometrics and facial recognition to confirm a person\u2019s identity before the startup deleted the personal data.

Because this is a full acquisition, not just an acqui-hire, Confirm.io\u2019s team and tech could help Facebook strengthen and streamline these options. And one day, perhaps Facebook could even serve as your ID card in some situations. Face ID on the iPhone X could eventually be opened to third parties to power more biometric security across apps.

The \u201cFacebook Container,\u201d as the new extension is called, isolates your Facebook identity from the rest of the web. That means Facebook will not be able to use your other web activity to send your targeted advertising.  To be clear, this extension wouldn\u2019t have saved users\u2019 data from being compromised as it was in the Cambridge Analytica scandal; and it does nothing to prevent Facebook advertisers from diving into your profile and your activity while on the social network in order to target you with advertisements while browsing Facebook.  However, it is meant to plug at least one of the holes in Facebook\u2019s leaky dam by offering a way for users to prevent Facebook from gaining even more data collected outside its service.  \u201cContainers are a feature built into the Firefox platform that separate user cookies and site data into different cookie jars,\u201d explains Jeff Griffiths, Product Lead for Firefox. \u201cFor Facebook Container specifically, this means that a user should only be able to log in in the Facebook Container. Facebook cookies and site data that identify the user are only available to that Container, and only Facebook can be open in that Container,\u201d he says.  When you install the new extension, it deletes your Facebook cookies and logs you out of the social network. The next time you open Facebook, you\u2019ll notice it\u2019s been opened in a blue-colored \u201ccontainer\u201d tab.  From within that tab, you can continue to use Facebook normally. However, if you click a link that would take you to a page off of Facebook, it will load the URL outside the container. Similarly, if you click any Facebook Share buttons outside of Facebook, it will load those in the Facebook container. (But this will send information to Facebook about the website you shared them from, it should be noted.)  In addition, you may not be able to login to third-party apps with your Facebook credentials, and the embedded Facebook comments and Like buttons you see around the web won\u2019t work either.  \u201cThis prevents Facebook from associating information about your activity on websites outside of Facebook to your Facebook identity,\u201d explains The Firefox Frontier blog. \u201cSo it may look different than what you are used to seeing.\u201d  Actually, it may surprise you to find out how widespread your use of Facebook was when outside the social network.

Abandon your transparently greedy get-rich-quick schemes, turn away from your casinos of de-facto modern-day penny stocks, and focus your decentralized attention on what the world needs. Save us, O blockchainers, from the scourge that is Facebook! Decentralize all the things!  I\u2019m kidding, of course. For now.  Every year, it seems, a new \u201cnew Facebook\u201d arises, swells, deflates, and vanishes, generally in a matter of weeks. Remember Diaspora? Ello? Mastodon? Vero? I imagine them as gangs of bandits charging The Wall in Game of Thrones, prompting the Night\u2019s Watch of Menlo Park to \u2026 ignore them completely until they go away. The critical mass of everyone you know, plus the cost and complexity of an infrastructure that provides a broad panoply of valuable features to two billion people \u2014 those are Facebook\u2019s 700-foot-high barrier of enchanted ice.  And yet. It is whispered in dark corners, at conventions with names like Consensus and TokenFest, that there is a secret tunnel in that wall, a fundamental flaw. That Facebook\u2019s advantage of massive scale could melt away if faced by the dark magic of decentralization, wherein users own their own data, encrypted by them, stored in the location of their choice, shared only as and when they explicitly approve, while they connect peer-to-peer with interactions mediated and paid for via a tokenized protocol, across an armada of nodes running \u2014 yep, you guessed it \u2014 some sort of blockchain.  This is essentially nonsense. For now. Its fundamental flaw is the fundamental flaw of most grandiose decentralized blockchain notions; they are too much, too large, too megalomaniacal, too soon. They want to supplant the entire existing order, whether it be money, the entire financial sector, democratic governance, social media \u2026 or, really, pick a field of human endeavour, there\u2019s probably some white paper outlining a token-based decentralized wholesale replacement for the way things are done now.  Dear blockchain people: stop it. I like big thinking as much as anyone, but in practice you don\u2019t change things by overthrowing them. You won\u2019t blow out a torch that\u2019s been burning for many years with your new Big Bang. Instead, in practice, you start small, with a tiny cohort of enthusiasts, and you iterate \u2014 sometimes for a very long time \u2014 before you get any traction that the wider world notices at all. You do not, repeat not, gather a band of adventurers together in an inn to immediately form up and charge The Wall.  Especially stop it with consumer applications. I stand by my statement that \u201cblockchains are the new Linux, not the new Internet\u201d more strongly with each passing month. Blockchain enthusiasts may enjoy perusing their wallets and counting how many different kinds of ERC20 tokens \u2014 which generally still have no actual utility, beyond that of a penny stock \u2014 are contained within. Ordinary users, however, do not.  Better token UX won\u2019t fix their fundamental problem. Online micropayments didn\u2019t fail again and again because decentralized tokens weren\u2019t a thing yet; they failed because their cognitive load was far too great to sustain their use. Tokens don\u2019t change that one iota. If your consumer decentralized app involves ordinary users knowingly accumulating, spending, or transferring custom tokens, your consumer decentralized app will fail.  But, you know what? Having said all that? I wasn\u2019t kidding with the first line of this post. Dear blockchain people, this is your hour, if you would only recognize it. But your objective is not to compete with, or replace, centralized services. That may never be the objective, and that\u2019s OK. Rather, your goal right now is to create a viable alternative for those who reject existing centralized services, whether they be many or few.  That\u2019s what Bitcoin itself is, after all; a weird little alternative to centralized finance. Over the course of a decade it has, beyond astonishingly, actually become viable, useful, self-sufficient, and globally successful, but it remains a weird little alternative, and will for the foreseeable future.  In its wake we now have the tools to create decentralized apps that aren\u2019t just about value transfer. Consider Blockstack, which includes \u201ca decentralized micro-blogging app\u201d among its basic tutorials. Consider Cosmos, designed to allow blockchains to interoperate with one another, forming a decentralized web of chains they call \u201cthe Internet of blockchains.\u201d And of course consider Ethereum, which, believe it or not, isn\u2019t just for ICOs, but lets you run arbitrary decentralized code, and, importantly, has serious plans to massively scale its throughput.  We\u2019re approaching \u2014 or maybe already at \u2014 the point at which these tools could be put together to construct, say, a small-scale decentralized social network. It would still face the critical-mass problem: but that could be addressed by focusing on specific cohorts and communities; art collectives, churches, fandoms, etcetera. It would still face the ordinary-people-don\u2019t-want-tokens problem: but that could be addressed by having a designated token-handling admin for each node, in the same way that online communities used to have designated email admins or local Usenet sysadmins, so ordinary users would just need a URL, a userid/password, and perhaps a decision whether to pay for access or be advertised to.  Is this vague and handwavey? You betcha. But I\u2019ve done a fair amount of decentralized systems coding myself, of late, and I can tell you that the tools and networks are \u2014 well. They\u2019re getting there. They\u2019re close. And once you\u2019ve built a local social network wherein users control their data, one which is part of a higher-order decentralized network of nodes, all communicating via a common tokenized protocol \u2026 well, then you have a whole world of new, interesting, and daunting scaling problems.  But my point is that you don\u2019t have to scale to the size of Facebook for an alternative to be viable. Think small. The Wall isn\u2019t going anywhere, but maybe you don\u2019t need to traverse it after all. The world will have Facebook for a long time to come, but Facebook doesn\u2019t have to be part of your world \u2026 especially if a weird, clunky, charmingly ramshackle little alternative exists, one from which you ultimately find you get far more net emotional and practical value. If things keep going as they are, maybe you won\u2019t ever have to go through the Wall to get to the people on the other side. Maybe, eventually, they\u2019ll come to you.", "stock": "FB", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-25", "source": "techcrunch", "url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/03/25/towards-a-world-without-facebook/"}, {"article": "Onavo Protect, the VPN client from the data-security app maker acquired by Facebook back in 2013, has now popped up in the Facebook iOS app itself, under the banner \u201cProtect\u201d in the navigation menu.

The company now confirms this is available to iOS users in the U.S.]  We do know this is not the first time Onavo\u2019s Protect has shown up in Facebook\u2019s app \u2013 it was spotted before in 2016 in the UK. The company also tells us it\u2019s been available in the Android app since around the same time.  Marketing Onavo within Facebook itself could lead to a boost in users for the VPN app, which promises to warn users of malicious websites and keep information secure \u2013 like bank account and credit card numbers \u2013 as you browse. But Facebook didn\u2019t buy Onavo for its security protections.  Instead, Onavo\u2019s VPN allow Facebook to monitor user activity across apps, giving Facebook a big advantage in terms of spotting new trends across the larger mobile ecosystem. For example, Facebook gets an early heads up about apps that are becoming breakout hits; it can tell which are seeing slowing user growth; it sees which apps\u2019 new features appear to be resonating with their users, and much more.  This data has already helped Facebook in a number of ways, most notably in its battle with Snapchat. At The WSJ reported last August, Facebook could tell that Instagram\u2019s launch of Stories \u2013 a Snapchat-like feature \u2013 was working to slow Snapchat\u2019s user growth, before the company itself even publicly disclosed this fact.  This past fall, Facebook snatched up the teen compliment app tbh, and quickly integrated a similar Q&A feature into its social network soon after. This all took place before Tbh had truly established itself as a new social network. It wasn\u2019t clear at the time if it was the next big thing, or just a flash in the pan. (It appears to have been the latter.) Onavo\u2019s insights into Tbh\u2019s fast rise and heavy engagement likely gave Facebook a heads-up.  The Onavo app today has more than 33 million installs across the iOS App Store and Google Play, according to data from Sensor Tower. Around 62 percent of those from Google Play \u2013 which could be another reason why Facebook is giving Onavo a push on iOS. The U.S. is currently the app\u2019s largest user base, followed by India and Brazil.  Onavo\u2019s app store description explains that it\u2019s \u201ca part of Facebook,\u201d and that it\u2019s used to \u201cimprove Facebook products and services, gain insights into the products and service people value, and build better experiences.\u201d  However, it\u2019s not likely that all Onavo users understand they\u2019re actually feeding Facebook the information that allows it to take on any challenger to its social networking empire. (That empire also includes WhatsApp and Instagram as well as smaller acquisitions like tbh and MSQRD).  This would not be the first time Facebook has integrated one of its other mobile apps into Facebook itself. The company earlier made it easier to launch Instagram through a new Facebook feature, and it has tested and rolled out various WhatsApp integrations, too.  Facebook hasn\u2019t yet offered a comment on the new addition of Onavo to its main app, but we\u2019ll update this post if one is provided.  * Update, 2/13/18, 9:30 PM ET: Facebook has now provided a comment, confirming the iOS addition is new.  \u201cWe recently began letting people in the U.S. access Onavo Protect from the Facebook app on their iOS devices,\u201d Erez Naveh, Product Manager at Onavo told TechCrunch via email. \u201cLike other VPNs, it acts as a secure connection to protect people from potentially harmful sites. The app may collect your mobile data traffic to help us recognize tactics that bad actors use. Over time, this helps the tool work better for you and others.

By letting them downvote inappropriate comments to hide them. Facebook is now testing a downvote button on a limited set of public Page post comment reels, the company confirms to TechCrunch. But what Facebook does with signals about problematic comments could raise new questions about censorship, and its role as a news editor and media company.  A Facebook spokesperson tells TechCrunch Facebook that the motivation behind the downvote button is to create a lightweight way for people to provide a signal to Facebook that a comment is inappropriate, uncivil, or misleading.  Here\u2019s the statement Facebook provided: \u201cWe are not testing a dislike button. We are exploring a feature for people to give us feedback about comments on public page posts. This is running for a small set of people in the U.S. only.\u201d  This is what the downvote button looks like up close:  When tapped, the downvote button hides a comment, and gives users additional reporting options like \u201cOffensive\u201d, \u201cMisleading\u201d, and \u201cOff Topic\u201d. Those could help Facebook figure out if the comment is objectionable, a form of \u201cfake news\u201d, or just irrelevant. Facebook already has a \u201cHide\u201d button for comments, but it\u2019s usually hidden behind the drop-down arrow on comments rather than immediately clickable.  Here you can see the downvote button on a comment thread, plus what happens when you click it. The screenshots come from Christina Hudler.  According to Facebook, this is a short-term test that doesn\u2019t affect the ranking of the comment, post, or Page. It\u2019s designed as a way to give feedback to Facebook, not the commenter, and there will be no publicly visible count of how many downvotes a comment gets. The test is running for 5% of Android users in the U.S. with language set to English. The downvote button only appears on public Page posts, not on posts by Groups, public figures or users. There\u2019s currently no plan to expand the test as is.  Not A Dislike Button  A dislike button has long been the most requested Facebook feature, but Facebook has never given in.  Back in 2015, CEO Mark Zuckerberg responded to a Q&A question about it, saying:  \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to just build a Dislike button because we don\u2019t want to turn Facebook into a forum where people are voting up or down on people\u2019s posts. That doesn\u2019t seem like the kind of community we want to create.\u201d  Instead, Facebook built the Reactions options that let you respond to posts and comments with love, wow, haha, sad or angry emoji. Facebook also built reactions into Messenger with the option to give messages a thumbs-up or thumbs-down so you could show agreement or disagreement.  But the new downvote button is the closest Facebook has come to actually giving people a dislike button. Downvoting was popularized on Reddit for crowdsourcedcomment ranking. Reddit co-founder Alexi Ohanian weighed in on Facebook\u2019s version via Twitter:  Sincerest form of flattery! Wish I'd trademarked it and \u201cupvote\u201d when came up with it. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 https://t.co/wJMxILChCV \u2014 Alexis Ohanian Sr. (@alexisohanian) February 8, 2018  The downvote button ties in with Facebook\u2019s recent push to enhance its users\u2019 well-being by prioritizing News Feed content that drives meaningful interactions instead of passive, zombie browsing. That led Facebook to show fewer viral videos, which in turn contributed to a 700,000 user decrease in U.S. and Canada daily active users \u2014 its first decline ever anywhere \u2014 and Facebook\u2019s slowest DAU growth rate it\u2019s ever reported.  But one way Facebook could generate more meaningful interaction without losing time on site could be by ensuring the most interesting comments are at the top of posts. Facebook already ranks comments by relevancy based on Likes and replies. But the downvote button could ensure that if objectionable comments rise up and stall discussion, Facebook will know.  That could eventually lead to a way for Facebook to bury these comments, or the people that post them. However, this will only open up more questions about censorship and what qualifies as inappropriate at a time when Facebook is already struggling to manage its responsibilities as what Zuckerberg calls \u201cnot a traditional media company.\u201d", "stock": "FB", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-09", "source": "techcrunch", "url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/02/08/facebook-downvote-button/"}, {"article": "Facebook Stories might feel redundant because 300 million people use its other Snapchat clones on Instagram and WhatsApp. But Facebook is convinced that the narrative, ephemeral, camera-first format is the future of sharing\u2026 and advertising.  So despite criticism and a slow start for traction, Facebook is doubling down on Stories by testing the ability to create them from desktop, and a much more prominent placement for viewing Stories atop the News Feed instead of in the sidebar.  \u201cWe are always working to ensure people can easily navigate and enjoy Facebook, regardless of how they connect,\u201d a Facebook spokesperson tells me. \u201cWe are testing the option to create and share Stories from Facebook on desktop and are also testing moving the Stories tray from the top right corner to above News Feed, just like on mobile.\u201d Previously you could only consume Stories on web that had to be created on mobile. For now, a small percentage of users will see this new posting ability and design.  All aboard the Stories train  Brands, Event promoters, and Group admins who manage their Facebook presence from desktop might embrace Stories more now that they can post from there, too. Collaborative Stories, where Group members and Event attendees can all contribute, are one of the most exciting opportunities for Facebook Stories.  But the company has to be careful that brands don\u2019t drown out friends\u2019 Stories, but that\u2019s one of the advantages of algorithmically filtering the slideshows that disappear in 24 hours. Expect Facebook not to make the same mistake it made allowing professional publishers to overwhelm the News Feed, which it\u2019s now walking back in a massive change to its content ranking strategy.  Advertisers might also be more comfortable getting aboard Stories thanks to desktop access. Digiday reports Facebook is building an augmented reality team in London to help it pitch sponsored AR filters to advertisers, similar to how Snapchat monetizes beyond injecting traditional display ads between Stories as Facebook does on Instagram.  Facebook users will be able to upload photos or videos, or shoot them with their webcam to post from desktop. That could attract the monologue-style YouTube vloggers who have trained themselves to talk into their computer.  By showing Stories above the News Feed instead of to the side, Facebook clearly thinks the content deserves more attention, and is even willing to push down its status update composer and News Feed posts to make room. That\u2019s a bold shift, considering Facebook hesitated until August to show Stories on desktop after their January launch and March rollout on mobile.  Stories are critical to Facebook\u2019s AR future  CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said that while eyeglass computers might be the future of augmented reality, Facebook won\u2019t wait for it, and the smartphone is already a capable AR device. But for Facebook to have a functioning AR strategy \u2014 whether for keeping people coming back to play with AR face masks, watch friends jazz up their lives or giving advertisers creative tools \u2014 it has to get people watching Stories en masse.  That\u2019s why it started syncing Facebook Stories across Facebook and Messenger so posts on one show up in both. It\u2019s why it\u2019s allowing people to syndicate their Instagram Stories to Facebook Stories. It\u2019s why it\u2019s recruiting an army of outside developers to build AR tools for Story-tellers. And it\u2019s why Facebook\u2019s desktop site is now fully adopting Stories.  Whether users warm up to them is another question. Facebook\u2019s social graph has bloated to include distant acquaintances and family you might not want to be able to see a raw view into your day-to-day adventures. That\u2019s the advantage of Snapchat\u2019s closer-friends network, and something Facebook may need a better privacy solution for to get people to share.  But remember that people protested the News Feed when it first arrived on Facebook. And the younger generation that\u2019s addicted to Snapchat shows how users can pour a half hour a day into sending, posting and watching camera-based content. If that\u2019s any portent, Facebook might just be early to delivering mainstream users the shift from text to Stories. And if you give people a prominent space to show off for friends, vanity and narcissism may eventually compel them to fill that space with snippets of their lives.", "stock": "FB", "label": 1, "date": "2018-01-18", "source": "techcrunch", "url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/01/18/facebook-stories-here-to-stay/"}, {"article": "Facebook retracted Zuckerberg\u2019s messages from recipients\u2019 inboxes Facebook says it was for security, but is it a breach of user trust?  You can\u2019t remove Facebook messages from the inboxes of people you sent them to, but Facebook did that for Mark Zuckerberg and other executives. Three sources confirm to TechCrunch that old Facebook messages they received from Zuckerberg have disappeared from their Facebook inboxes, while their own replies to him conspicuously remain. An email receipt of a Facebook message from 2010 reviewed by TechCrunch proves Zuckerberg sent people messages that no longer appear in their Facebook chat logs or in the files available from Facebook\u2019s Download Your Information tool.  When asked by TechCrunch about the situation, Facebook claimed in this statement it was done for corporate security:  \u201cAfter Sony Pictures\u2019 emails were hacked in 2014 we made a number of changes to protect our executives\u2019 communications. These included limiting the retention period for Mark\u2019s messages in Messenger. We did so in full compliance with our legal obligations to preserve messages.\u201d  However, Facebook never publicly disclosed the removal of messages from users\u2019 inboxes, nor privately informed the recipients. That raises the question of whether this was a breach of user trust. When asked that question directly over Messenger, Zuckerberg declined to provide a statement.  Tampering with users\u2019 inboxes  A Facebook spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch that users can only delete messages from their own inboxes, and that they would still show up in the recipient\u2019s thread. There appears to be no \u201cretention period\u201d for normal users\u2019 messages, as my inbox shows messages from as early as 2005. That indicates Zuckerberg and other executives received special treatment in being able to pull back previously sent messages.  [Update 4/6/2018: Facebook now says that it plans to launch an \u201cunsend\u201d feature for Facebook messages to all users in the next several months, and won\u2019t let Mark Zuckerberg use that feature any more until it launches for everyone. One option Facebook is considering for the Unsend feature is an expiration timer users could set. But it\u2019s alarming that Facebook didn\u2019t disclose the retractions or plans for a Unsend button until forced, and scrambling to give everyone the feature seems like an effort to quiet users\u2019 anger over the situation.]  Facebook chats sent by Zuckerberg from several years ago or older were missing from the inboxes of both former employees and non-employees. What\u2019s left makes it look like the recipients were talking to themselves, as only their side of back-and-forth conversations with Zuckerberg still appear. Three sources asked to remain anonymous out of fear of angering Zuckerberg or burning bridges with the company.  [Update: Recent messages from Zuckerberg remain in users\u2019 inboxes. Old messages from before 2014 still appear to some users, indicating the retraction did not apply to all chats the CEO sent. But more sources have come forward since publication, saying theirs disappeared, as well.]  None of Facebook\u2019s terms of service appear to give it the right to remove content from users\u2019 accounts unless it violates the company\u2019s community standards. While it\u2019s somewhat standard for corporations to have data retention policies that see them delete emails or other messages from their own accounts that were sent by employees, they typically can\u2019t remove the messages from the accounts of recipients outside the company. It\u2019s rare that these companies own the communication channel itself and therefore host both sides of messages as Facebook does in this case, which potentially warrants a different course of action with more transparency than quietly retracting the messages.  Facebook\u2019s power to tamper with users\u2019 private message threads could alarm some. The issue is amplified by the fact that Facebook Messenger now has 1.3 billion users, making it one of the most popular communication utilities in the world.  Zuckerberg is known to have a team that helps him run his Facebook profile, with some special abilities for managing his 105 million followers and constant requests for his attention. For example, Zuckerberg\u2019s profile doesn\u2019t show a button to add him as a friend on desktop, and the button is grayed out and disabled on mobile. But the ability to change the messaging inboxes of other users is far more concerning.  Facebook may have sought to prevent leaks of sensitive corporate communications. Following the Sony hack, emails of Sony\u2019s president Michael Lynton, who sat on Snap Inc.\u2019s board, were exposed, revealing secret acquisitions and strategy.  However, Facebook also may have looked to thwart the publication of potentially embarrassing personal messages sent by Zuckerberg or other executives. In 2010, Silicon Alley Insider aka Business Insider published now-infamous instant messages from a 19-year-old Zuckerberg to a friend shortly after starting The Facebook in 2004. \u201cyea so if you ever need info about anyone at harvard . . . just ask . . . i have over 4000 emails, pictures, addresses, sns\u201d Zuckerberg wrote to a friend. \u201cwhat!? how\u2019d you manage that one?\u201d they asked. \u201cpeople just submitted it . . i don\u2019t know why . . . they \u2018trust me\u2019 . . . dumb fucks\u201d Zuckerberg explained.  The New Yorker later confirmed the messages with Zuckerberg, who told the publication he \u201cabsolutely\u201d regretted them. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to go on to build a service that is influential and that a lot of people rely on, then you need to be mature, right? I think I\u2019ve grown and learned a lot,\u201d said Zuckerberg.  If the goal of Facebook\u2019s security team was to keep a hacker from accessing the accounts of executives and therefore all of their messages, they could have merely been deleted on their side the way any Facebook user is free to do, without them disappearing from the various recipients\u2019 inboxes. If Facebook believed it needed to remove the messages entirely from its servers in case the company\u2019s backend systems we breached, a disclosure of some kind seems reasonable.  Now as Facebook encounters increased scrutiny regarding how it treats users\u2019 data in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, the retractions could become a bigger issue. Zuckerberg is slated to speak in front of the U.S. Senate Judiciary and Commerce committees on April 10, as well as the House Energy and Commerce Committee on April 11. They could request more information about Facebook removing messages or other data from users\u2019 accounts without their consent. While Facebook is trying to convey that it understands its responsibilities, the black mark left on public opinion by past behavior may prove permanent.

Facebook is also now preemptively blocking the creation of millions of fake accounts per day. Facebook revealed this news on a conference call with journalists [Update: and later a blog post] about its efforts around election integrity that included Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos, who\u2019s reportedly leaving Facebook later this year but claims he\u2019s still committed to the company.  Stamos outlined how Facebook is building ways to address fake identities, fake audiences grown illicitly or pumped up to make content appear more popular, acts of spreading false information and false narratives that are intentionally deceptive and shape people\u2019s views beyond the facts. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to develop a systematic and comprehensive approach to tackle these challenges, and then to map that approach to the needs of each country or election,\u201d says Stamos.  Samidh Chakrabarti, Facebook\u2019s product manager for civic engagement, also explained that Facebook is now proactively looking for foreign-based Pages producing civic-related content inauthentically. It removes them from the platform if a manual review by the security team finds they violate terms of service.  \u201cThis proactive approach has allowed us to move more quickly and has become a really important way for us to prevent divisive or misleading memes from going viral,\u201d said Chakrabarti. Facebook first piloted this tool in the Alabama special election where the proactive system identified and shut down a ring of Macedonian spammers meddling with the election to earn money, but has now deployed it to protect Italian elections and will use it for the U.S. mid-term elections.  Meanwhile, advances in machine learning have allowed Facebook \u201cto find more suspicious behaviors without assessing the content itself\u201d to block millions of fake account creations per day \u201cbefore they can do any harm,\u201d says Chakrabarti. [Update 2:15pm PST: Facebook is expected to share more about these tools during its \u201cFighting Abuse @Scale\u201d conference in SF on April 25th.]  Facebook implemented its first slew of election protections back in December 2016, including working with third-party fact checkers to flag articles as false. But those red flags were shown to entrench some people\u2019s belief in false stories, leading Facebook to shift to showing Related Articles with perspectives from other reputable news outlets. As of yesterday, Facebook\u2019s fact checking partners began reviewing suspicious photos and videos which can also spread false information. This could reduce the spread of false news image memes that live on Facebook and require no extra clicks to view, like doctored photos showing the Parkland school shooting survivor Emma Gonz\u00e1lez ripping up the constitution.  Normally, Facebook sends fact checkers stories that are being flagged by users and going viral. But now in countries like Italy and Mexico, in anticipation of elections, Facebook has enabled fact checkers to proactively flag things because in some cases they can identify false stories that are spreading before Facebook\u2019s own systems. \u201cTo reduce latency in advance of elections, we wanted to ensure we gave fact checkers that ability,\u201d says Facebook\u2019s News Feed product manager Tessa Lyons.  With the mid-terms coming up quick, Facebook has to both secure its systems against election interference, as well as convince users and regulators that it\u2019s made real progress since the 2016 presidential election, where Russian meddlers ran rampant.

The changes have left investors wondering whether people will still spend as much time on the site and whether brands will continue placing as many digital ads there.  On Wednesday, Facebook sought to soothe Wall Street\u2019s worries over those questions. No, people will not spend as much time on the site, the company said as it reported quarterly financial results. But don\u2019t worry, Facebook added, because the changes will ultimately benefit its business.  With the adjustments to what it shows on its site, \u201cI believe that the time spent on Facebook will be more valuable,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said in a conference call with analysts. \u201cIf people interact more, it should lead to stronger community. When you care about something, you\u2019re willing to see ads to experience it.\u201d  The scrutiny followed changes that Facebook announced in January to its News Feed, the scrolling screen of content that the social network\u2019s more than two billion members see when they log in to the site. After months of criticism over the harmful effects of the social network, Mr. Zuckerberg said Facebook wanted to emphasize more \u201cmeaningful\u201d content, such as photos and posts that friends and family have interacted with, and would play down articles from publishers. At the time, Mr. Zuckerberg acknowledged that the shift might cause people to spend less time on Facebook, at least in the short run.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  That has already proven to be true in some instances, Facebook revealed on Wednesday. The shift to more meaningful content has just started rolling out, but the company made other changes last year as a precursor to the latest moves, including cutting down on viral videos. In response, Facebook users over all reduced the time they spent on the platform by roughly 50 million hours a day, Mr. Zuckerberg said, which translates to about two minutes a day for each of the company\u2019s 1.4 billion daily users.", "stock": "FB", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-01", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/31/technology/facebook-news-feed.html"}, {"article": "But Mr. Stretch added that this content was a smidgen of the total content available across Facebook:  \u201cThis equals about four-thousandths of 1 percent (0.004 percent) of content in News Feed, or approximately one out of 23,000 pieces of content.\u201d  And on Friday, Rob Goldman, Facebook\u2019s vice president for ads, noted that more than half of the Russian Facebook ads (56 percent) were served after the 2016 election.  Quoting tiny fractions suggests content on Facebook gets drowned out in a torrent of information. But the company\u2019s whole business model is based on giving ads and posts prominence in the feeds of well-targeted users.  Questions for Facebook:  Has Facebook performed any analyses that looks at smaller groups of people? If so, can Facebook share them? And how did the ads perform before and after the election?  To what extent did Russia target swing states?  Mr. Mueller\u2019s latest indictment says that, after the middle of 2016, Russians often talked about targeting \u201cpurple states,\u201d or those in which the number of Republican and Democratic voters are close. The indictment also describes the Russians as focused on Florida, which Mr. Trump ended up winning.  \u201cOn or about August 4, 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators created and purchased Facebook advertisements for the \u2018Florida Goes Trump\u2019 rally. The advertisements reached over 59,000 Facebook users in Florida, and over 8,300 Facebook users responded to the advertisements by clicking on it.\u201d  Others have asserted in the past that Russia did not appear to focus its social media efforts on swing states. As Senator Richard Burr, Republican of North Carolina and chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, noted last year:  \u201cWhat you haven\u2019t heard is that almost five times more ads were targeted at Maryland than Wisconsin. Maryland, which was targeted by 262 ads in comparison to Wisconsin\u2019s 55, wasn\u2019t up for grabs; it was a state the Democratic candidate carried by 26 percent.\u201d  Questions for Facebook:  Do the company\u2019s records show that Russia-backed ads and posts reached a higher number of people in certain states or regions of the United States? If so, how responsive were Facebook users in those targeted regions to the Russian posts and ads?  The Russia-backed groups were incredibly successful at gaining followers.  Jonathan Albright, research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia, has done revealing work on Facebook\u2019s Russia-linked pages that is more detailed than anything the company has made public. Mr. Albright\u2019s data, obtained using CrowdTangle, an analytics tool owned by Facebook, shows the speed with which the Russia-backed groups grew.  Blacktivist, a Russia-linked group whose often inflammatory content set it apart from legitimate groups championing African-American rights, had 14,000 followers at the end of 2015. By the time its Facebook page was shut down last year, it had 390,000, according to Mr. Albright\u2019s data \u2014 a hugely successful ramp up that took Blacktivist\u2019s total followers above that for Black Lives Matter. Other Russian-created groups, like Heart of Texas, also showed huge increases in followers.  Questions for Facebook:  How exactly were these groups able to scoop up so many members so quickly? Did the speed of the increases wave any red flags internally at Facebook? To what extent did Facebook\u2019s ad targeting tools, which allow advertisers to reach specific groups of people, enable Russia to put incendiary posts in the feeds of certain groups? And one from Mr. Albright: What were the follower totals and other data for any private Facebook pages that were backed by the Russians?  Why this issue isn\u2019t going away for Facebook.  It may well be the case that Russian disinformation did not swing the election for Mr. Trump. But it may have had far more of an impact than the public knows. And Facebook is almost certainly sitting on data that could deepen the nation\u2019s understanding of what went on.  \u201cI can\u2019t imagine what it would it look like if we had all the data,\u201d Mr. Albright said.", "stock": "FB", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-20", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/20/business/dealbook/facebook-russia-questions.html"}, {"article": "Now, Facebook is in the uncomfortable position of reining in an off-message executive, while clarifying that it didn\u2019t mean to bolster the president\u2019s position.  \u201cThe special counsel has issued its indictments, and nothing we found contradicts their conclusions,\u201d Joel Kaplan, Facebook\u2019s vice president of global policy, said in a statement. \u201cAny suggestion otherwise is wrong.\u201d  Photo  Mr. Goldman did not respond to requests for comment, and the company declined to make him available for an interview.  It is Facebook\u2019s right to defend itself, of course. The company has faced a raft of accusations of wrongdoing, some of which have indeed been overblown. Facebook was not the only social network manipulated by Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency, the company at the heart of Mr. Mueller\u2019s indictment. And other companies, such as Twitter and YouTube, certainly share the blame for fostering a media ecosystem in which false news and propaganda can flourish.  But Mr. Goldman\u2019s tweetstorm was unintentionally revealing. It showed that, years after hostile foreign actors first began using Facebook to wage an information war against the American public, some high-ranking officials within the company still don\u2019t understand just how central Facebook was to Russia\u2019s misinformation campaign, and how consequential the company\u2019s mistakes have been. (Last year, in a tweet that fewer people saw, Andrew Bosworth, another Facebook vice president, claimed that the effects of Russian interference and fake news in 2016 were \u201cmarginal, even in a close election.\u201d)  In real-world terms, a part of Facebook still sees itself as the bank that got robbed, rather than the architect who designed a bank with no safes, and no alarms or locks on the doors, and then acted surprised when burglars struck.

Even before Mr. Goldman\u2019s tweets were blasted along to Mr. Trump\u2019s 48 million followers, they lacked crucial context about what exactly Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation had found. He made sweeping pronouncements about the misuse of Facebook\u2019s advertising products while neglecting to mention that most of Russia\u2019s exploitation took the form of nonadvertising posts. He claimed that swinging the election in Mr. Trump\u2019s favor was not a primary goal of Russia\u2019s Facebook campaign, when Mr. Mueller\u2019s indictment had just concluded that it was. He portrayed Facebook as having been eager to promote its findings on the Russia investigation, when in fact the company has made disclosures only under pressure from regulators, and has deliberately hidden data about Russia\u2019s interference from outside researchers.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Some of Mr. Goldman\u2019s claims may have been narrowly true, but they were a prime example of misdirection. Why is educating citizens about digital literacy the solution to misinformation, as Mr. Goldman suggested, rather than fixing the tech platforms that make misinformation hard to distinguish from truth? Why should it reassure us that most of Russia\u2019s Facebook advertising was purchased after the election, rather than telling us that Facebook continued to drop the ball even after it knew it had a Russia problem?  More than anything, the details contained in the indictment make clear how vulnerable Facebook still is to a hostile actor. None of the safeguards it has announced so far \u2014 such as providing more transparency about political ads, or using snail-mail postcards to verify the identities of certain political advertisers \u2014 would stop a sophisticated and well-funded foreign influence operation. And many of the tactics the Internet Research Agency used in 2016 \u2014 including posing as American citizens to create large partisan Facebook pages and organizing offline rallies with the help of American co-conspirators \u2014 would be just as effective today.  In a recent cover story, Wired detailed the soul-searching journey that Facebook\u2019s executives have undertaken since the 2016 election. First, they denied that they\u2019d done anything wrong. Then, after the scope of Russia\u2019s misinformation campaign became clear, they circled the wagons to protect the company\u2019s reputation and appease its critics. Only recently have certain executives, like Mark Zuckerberg, its chief executive, come to appreciate the scale and scope of Facebook\u2019s errors, and publicly accept responsibility for them.  We may never get answers about what Facebook knew of the Russian interference campaign in 2016, and why it didn\u2019t act more forcefully to stop it. (Trust me, I\u2019ve tried.) But it\u2019s deeply troubling that eight months before the 2018 midterms, as malicious forces continue to use social media to sow discord and meddle in elections all over the world, some at Facebook seem more interested in defending themselves from criticism than owning their mistakes, fixing their platform\u2019s problems and protecting our democracy.", "stock": "FB", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-19", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/19/technology/russia-facebook-trump.html"}, {"article": "Separately, White House officials left the details of the president\u2019s $1.5 trillion infrastructure plan to Congress.

Photo  Back Story  On this day in 1887, Harvey Wilcox, a real estate developer from Kansas, filed a plan with Los Angeles County for a small, gridded subdivision that he called Hollywood. (The origin of the name is a subject of dispute.)  Over the next decade, Mr. Wilcox and his wife, Daeida, conjured out of the desert a strict Christian community of orchards and Victorian cottages, connected to Los Angeles by a lone streetcar line.  Photo  There were just a few hundred residents, and the hamlet banned alcohol, bowling alleys and even, briefly, movie theaters. But in 1910, Hollywood voted to merge with Los Angeles.  Soon, movie studios fled the enforcement of Thomas Edison\u2019s monopoly on film patents and started setting up in the ideal Southern California light.  In 1923, the Hollywoodland sign went up (it was truncated to Hollywood in 1949). The original sign was an illuminated billboard for a segregated housing development that called itself a fortress against \u201cmetropolitanism\u201d; one ad urged, \u201cProtect your family.\u201d  The sign was left up as the so-called Golden Age of Hollywood arrived, a noirish era embodied by the starlet Peg Entwistle, who jumped to her death from the H in 1932.

For publishers, Facebook\u2019s new ranking system raised immediate concerns, including whether crowdsourcing users\u2019 opinions on trustworthiness might be open to manipulation.  \u201cIt is absolutely a positive move to start to try to separate the wheat from the chaff in terms of reputation and use brands as proxies for trust,\u201d said Jason Kint, the chief executive of Digital Content Next, a trade group that represents entertainment and news organizations, including The New York Times. \u201cBut the devil\u2019s in the details on how they\u2019re going to actually execute on that.\u201d  He continued, \u201cHow does that get hacked or gamed?

David Kaye, the United Nations\u2019 Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression, said that Facebook would probably face more difficult questions as it rolled out the new ranking program globally.  \u201cWhat will happen in situations where a community determines that a news source is trustworthy, but that news source is censored, or illegal, in that country?\u201d asked Mr. Kaye, noting that in many parts of the world, governments controlled all official news channels while independent news sources were outlawed or forced to publish pseudo-anonymously.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  In the past, he added, Facebook has abided by local rules where it operates abroad.  \u201cWhat will Mark Zuckerberg do when the needs of the community, in what it determines is trusted news, are different from what the government determines. Who will Facebook side with?\u201d said Mr. Kaye.  Raju Narisetti, the chief executive of the Gizmodo Media Group, the unit of Univision that operates Jezebel and other sites, said there was a \u201cgreat irony\u201d that Facebook, which has traditionally left decision up to an algorithm that incorporates the behaviors of its members, would open the decision-making to its users on such a matter. He added that the user-generated ranking system \u201cis a massive abdication of its social responsibility, as a vital platform, to be a good custodian of the Fourth Estate globally.\u201d  Other experiments that Facebook has tried with news in the past have sometimes gone awry or had unintended consequences. For example, a recent test to remove all news publishers from the News Feed and to place them under a separate tab in six countries, including Bolivia and Slovakia, yielded an unexpected result of magnifying the amount of fake news on the platform.  In his post on Friday, Mr. Zuckerberg said the newest change \u201cwill only shift the balance of news you see towards sources that are determined to be trusted by the community.\u201d  Facebook said news would be prioritized according to the new ranking system starting Monday, before expanding globally. Some Facebook users have already been asked to rank the trustworthiness of news sites which appear on the social network. In one survey, people were asked if they recognized a number of websites and then asked, \u201c\u201cHow much do you trust each of these domains?\u201d They were able to choose from a range of answers, including entirely, a lot, somewhat, barely and not at all.  The Silicon Valley company said it would continue polling users to refine and select which news outlets garnered the most trust. It declined to say how many people were polled or which news outlets they were asked about.  \u201cAs part of our ongoing quality surveys, we asked a diverse and representative sample of Facebook users across the U.S. to gauge their familiarity with, and trust in, sources of news,\u201d said Todd Breasseale, a Facebook spokesman. \u201cWe boost links from sources with high trust scores and demote links from sources with low trust scores.\u201d  Mr. Zuckerberg has been moving Facebook toward taking more responsibility for what shows up on the social network, especially after the criticism over the 2016 election and the interference by Russian agents. Earlier this month, he described his 2018 goals as including \u201cmaking sure that time spent on Facebook is time well spent.\u201d  In Friday\u2019s post, he hinted that ranking the credibility of news sources was just one step, with more potential changes to come.

Back Story  On this day in 1972, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Eisenstadt v. Baird that it\u2019s unconstitutional for a state to deny unmarried people access to contraception.  The court had ruled earlier, in 1965, that state bans on contraceptives for married couples violated their privacy rights. But a few states still restricted access for single people.  Photo  Bill Baird, an activist, violated one such law in Massachusetts. He appealed his conviction to the Supreme Court, which struck down the law.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Justice William Brennan held that the law violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment because it discriminated between married and unmarried people.  The case became an important precedent for landmark rulings by the Supreme Court, including the 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade that recognized abortion rights, and, more recently, the 2015 decision guaranteeing a right to same-sex marriage.  A movie about Mr. Baird\u2019s case is in development.  Mr. Baird has continued working as an activist, but his legacy is complicated by what The Times described in 1993 as an \u201cunapologetic zealotry\u201d and a willingness to criticize \u201ceven his ideologic allies.\u201d Planned Parenthood once called him an \u201cembarrassment.\u201d  Jillian Rayfield contributed reporting.  _____  Your Morning Briefing is published weekdays and updated all morning.

A Facebook representative confirmed to the Verge that the downvote link is currently being tested among a small selection of US-based users who began sharing screen grabs on Twitter yesterday.

First off, let\u2019s clarify that this is happening according to TechCrunch, which spotted the new \u2018Protect\u2019 option over in the US, on Facebook\u2019s iOS app only (not Android). As the site observes, this may mean the social network is only testing the feature at this point with a limited user base over in the States. (Onavo has also been previously pushed in testing over in the UK).  If you click on Protect in the navigation menu, you\u2019ll get taken straight through to the App Store listing for the \u2018Onavo Protect \u2013 VPN Security\u2019 product, which you can obviously install from there.  On the face of it, like any other VPN product, Onavo is designed to keep you more secure online by encrypting the data you transmit over your internet connection (or indeed someone else\u2019s connection, like public Wi-Fi which is potentially insecure).  VPNs are also traditionally designed to maintain your anonymity and privacy online, but notably in Onavo Protect\u2019s store listing, there\u2019s no talk of privacy.  Instead, the app blurb states: \u201cTo provide this [protection], Onavo uses a VPN to establish a secure connection to direct all of your network communications through Onavo\u2019s servers. As part of this process, Onavo collects your mobile data traffic.  \u201cThis helps us improve and operate the Onavo service by analyzing your use of websites, apps and data. Because we're part of Facebook, we also use this info to improve Facebook products and services, gain insights into the products and services people value, and build better experiences.\u201d  Precious data  In other words, rather than maintaining your privacy, the app is making use of the data you send across the VPN connection to provide insights to Facebook on what its users are doing online.  Exactly how Facebook is using this data obviously isn\u2019t clear, although TechCrunch theorizes that the social network could employ it to see which rival apps are swiftly gaining popularity \u2013 for potential early acquisitions \u2013 or which features of other apps are working well (because it can see how many of its users are flocking to them).  That\u2019s all speculation, but what isn\u2019t speculation is that if you use this Onavo VPN, you are signing up to let Facebook use your data for its own insights, whatever they may be.  And Facebook is obviously wanting to push this VPN via its mobile app, although as mentioned at the outset, it\u2019s not clear whether this is just limited testing on the iOS platform at the moment.  We\u2019ll just have to wait and see to get more of a handle on whether this is still a case of dipping toes in the water, or a more full-on push to drive installations of Onavo Protect to Facebook users.  As ever, with any app you download, you should carefully read the product description and any other relevant info such as permissions, before you go ahead with installation.  There are, of course, plenty of other free VPNs out there if you\u2019re looking for alternatives, although the whole area can be something of a minefield given that providers of freebie services have to turn a profit somehow \u2013 which has led to some hair-raising accusations in the past.

Now, based on a report from Digitimes , Facebook may be looking to jump into the smart speaker war \u2014up until now dominated Amazon and Google\u2014with two devices focused more on the luxury crowd, developed by their Building 8 division and slated for release by July 2018.  Codenamed \u201cAloha\u201d and \u201cFiona\u201d, these devices will launch with 15-inch touchscreens built by LG Display\u2014more than doubling the Echo Show \u2019s screen size. They will support voice commands, and will focus on \u201cvideo chat\u201d and other unnamed \u201csocial networking functions\u201d.  Aloha is reportedly the nickname for Facebook\u2019s Portal , a $499 speaker that was first rumored last month during CES 2018 , and will be an upgrade over \u201cFiona\u201d. One such upgrade is that Portal will come bundled with a \u201cwide-angle lens\u201d capable of video calls and, Digitimes claims, facial recognition capable of logging users into Facebook instantly.  Bloomberg first announced rumors of these devices last August, and said Facebook would bundle them with a \u201cSiri-style voice assistant\u201d. But based on our Portal report last month, those plans might be scrapped; those sources claimed Portal would not be a \u201ctraditional\u201d smart speaker with an Alexa equivalent.

The Digitimes report claims they pushed the Portal and \"Fiona\" launch back two months to \"perfect the acoustic quality\".

Instead, he \u201cwants [Portal] to change user behavior and encourage phone-like usage among owners.\u201d  Speculating on that user behavior change isn\u2019t too difficult. More and more people are relying on voice assistants for their everyday needs, which pushes a lot of people towards staying in one tech ecosystem\u2014say, only using devices that can link to a Google Assistant, or services easily accessed through Alexa.

In a report where Facebook was updating users on their plans to restrict data access on the social platform, they also revealed that up to 87 million people globally have had their information shared improperly with Cambridge Analytica. Of that 87 million, around 5.6 million users were Indian.  The blog post by Mike Schroepfer, Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at Facebook, shared a graph of the country-specific break-up of users that have been affected by the data breach. Indian users only comprise 0.7% of the total, whereas over 70 million users in the United States were exploited.  Misuse of information stats  In an attempt to correct the problem, Schroepfer wrote of nine changes that Facebook will be making to better protect information about Facebook users. One of them is that the events API will see more strict regulations including the fact that third-party apps will no longer be able to access the guest lists for an event or view posts on the event wall.  The Groups API will also be seeing some changes. It's going to roll back access from third-party apps of viewing member lists of groups and removing posts that have any personal information attached to them.  The more dramatic change is, of course, the announcement that Facebook will be shutting down Partner Categories.

Senator Orrin Hatch met Zuckerberg in 2010 as part of the Senate Republican High Tech Task Force \u2013 a committee that aims to maintain the position of the US as a leader in the global tech industry.  \u201cYou said back then that Facebook would always be free,\u201d Hatch said during his five minutes. \u201cIs that still your objective?\u201d  \u201cSenator, yes,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cThere will always be a version of Facebook that is free.

Just as with the Snapdragon 835 VR Developer Kit, the Snapdragon 845 Mobile VR Reference Design's purpose is to provide a starting point from which other manufacturers can develop their own unique headsets. It's not a consumer product you'll see on store shelves.  Last year, Google, Facebook, Lenovo, HTC Vive and others announced headsets based on the Snapdragon 835 reference design. These include the now-official Lenovo Solo Mirage and China-exclusive HTC Vive Focus.  In 2018, expect many of these same companies to develop new standalone headsets based on Qualcomm's Snapdragon 845 design, with likely releases later in the year.  Qualcomm is also announcing a new smartphone reference design headset, which will support 2018's flagship phones that sport the Snapdragon 845 chipset. While Hugo Swart, Head of Virtual and Augmented Reality Business Group, Qualcomm Technologies, Inc., wouldn't name names during a conversation with TechRadar, he did say these include phones to be announced at MWC 2018.  The Samsung Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9 Plus are due to launch when the show gets underway next week, so we wouldn't be surprised to see the phones slotted into Qualcomm's headset at some point.  Image 1 of 3 Side view of the Snapdragon 845 reference design headset Image 2 of 3 Side view of the Snapdragon 845 reference design headset Image 3 of 3 Top view of the Snapdragon 845 reference design headset  Breathing fire into mobile VR  Qualcomm is continuing to put its chips (literally) on mobile as the future of consumer VR adoption, as opposed to tethered systems that require an expensive PC set up.  \"We see that mobile VR is the form factor that will take the technology to the masses,\" Swart told us.  The Snapdragon 845 VR headset brings with it all the standout features of the new chipset, including 30% faster graphics performance, 30% better power efficiency, and double the display throughput compared to the 835.  What's more, Swart said that with the Snapdragon 845, VR headsets can support 2K x 2K displays per eye.  An exciting addition to this year's reference design is room-scale six degrees of freedom (6DoF) tracking. This means that in addition to tracking your body, the headset will also track objects in the real world and bring them into the virtual world without the need for external sensors.  In practical terms, this means the headset will detect a real-life table in front of you, track it in relation to the environment you're in, and make sure you don't run into it. The table can also be brought into the virtual experience, being represented as, say, a rock that'd you also want to avoid.  Room-scale 6DoF is achievable thanks to the implementation of a technique called Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) on the 845. The Snapdragon 845 can do SLAM because it has \"a whole lot more horsepower\", Swart said.  That extra horsepower comes from a dedicated signal processor (DSP) in the chip. While the 835 had a DSP, the 845 now has a dedicated computational DSP on which to run SLAM, Swart explained.  Robust tracking is most often associated with tethered headsets, like the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive, which also rely on external sensors. For Qualcomm's mobile reference design to include room-scale tracking speaks the headset's capabilities (though we can't speak to quality just yet).  More information on the Snapdragon 845 VR headset's specs, price and availability will be announced at GDC 2018 in March.  The next wave  The design and build of the Snapdragon 845 headset isn't much different from the one prior, but that's to be expected. Qualcomm is simply providing the core functionality for mobile VR headsets, while manufacturers take the design and make it their own.  It's a strategy that seems to be working well for Qualcomm as new headsets come to market more quickly and more partners sign on; Swart cited 12 additional hardware manufacturers that said in November 2017 they would build headsets based on Qualcomm's reference design.  \"The proof point is that this strategy we have is bearing fruit, with the acceptance and the endorsement and the usage of Google, Facebook and Vive,\" Swart added.  The Snapdragon 845 VR headset sounds to be a step above what the 835 version could do. This should mean good things for mobile VR in 2018, and a new wave of improved headsets on the horizon.

The fight is constant, and some have posited that it's a war that is, in fact, unwinnable. Google took steps earlier this week to clean fake news out of its search \"snippets\" and Facebook has revamped its News Feed to focus less on articles and more on friend and family updates (though this might actually exacerbate the problem).

If you have one gadget and don't use the internet much, in Facebook's eyes you're probably a poor person.  Facebook's application says the algorithm is intended for use by \"third parties to increase awareness about products or services to online system users.\" Examples given include corporations and charities.  The patent essentially tells us that Facebook intends to add class to its advertising preferences. You know, the ones that until very recently allowed advertisers to filter by race and ethnicity, which they dragged their feet about fixing, and still hovers in the realm of \"temporarily disabled.\"  The patent's illustrations tells us a story. It's a tale of upper-class employees indoctrinated, sheltered, and inoculated from outside thinking. Facebook has been literally sitting there going \"what does it mean to be middle class\", defining it themselves, and getting excited about who they can sell class information to.  I love it when a company tells us more about itself like this. \"Working class\" is at the bottom of its graphs. Its idea of \"middle class\" is a homeowner in the cash-soaked city of Palo Alto; its artwork suggests that home ownership in San Jose is surely a lower-class indicator. Af if to say, who would buy a home there?  Facebook has *no* idea what \"middle class\" means, apparently: pic.twitter.com/GK1drH0Q53 \u2014 Stephen Canon (@stephentyrone) February 4, 2018  Looking at the patent's details, I can also imagine how this sets Facebook up to assign particular locations (like restaurants) or objects (brand names or items) to a socioeconomic class.  Meaning, it's not a stretch to think that Facebook will be able to decide from check-ins which restaurants, phones, and brands of shoes, are \"lower class.\"  Oops -- I meant to write \"working class.\" Really.  Open season on opportunity hoarding  Leave it to Facebook to race ahead of Black Mirror. In light of Facebook's recent announcement to focus on more \"concrete local issues\" it's not too hard to imagine how this could be used to keep working class renters out of a particular neighborhood, to facilitate predatory lending, or make sure that lower classes don't see your dating service ads.  This is not a new problem; Facebook is just 'improving' it. After reading the 2014 White House report on data, privacy, algorithms, and discrimination, Google engineer Jeremy Kun wrote:  Here's a not-so-imaginary example of the problem. A bank wants people to take loans with high interest rates, and it also serves ads for these loans. A modern idea is to use an algorithm to decide, based on the sliver of known information about a user visiting a website, which advertisement to present that gives the largest chance of the user clicking on it.  The bank then makes a tasty little ad offering much-needed money for little up front, and the algorithm takes over. Target the lower class, the working class -- which are often people of color, too -- because data shows poor people (those least in a position to take high-interest loans) are more likely than the general population to be so desperate that they'll take on a bad loan.  Kun explains, \"So an algorithm that is 'just' trying to maximize clickthrough may also be targeting black people, de facto denying them opportunities for fair loans.\"  According to Kun, under US law, a practice can be considered discriminatory \"even in the absence of intent.\" In comments he added:  E.g. if people in poorer neighborhoods are disproportionately shown ads for predatory loans because an algorithm decided it has higher clickthrough. They have fewer chances for a fair loan treatment because they aren't exposed to normal loan offers. Is that direct or indirect? In either case, it's illegal. Even if a practice is not racist by intention, it can have an disproportionate adverse impact on a particular racial class, and so it's still considered illegal.  Facebook's algorithm may not be making illegal decisions, but it is absolutely facilitating humans to do so. Welcoming them to it, actually. Not that Facebook lets the law deter them from making a buck. I mean, c'mon.  It's not too hard to think of ways Russia's state-sponsored propaganda trolls will use this new feature either.  Stay classy, Facebook  Well, you're saying, it's just an updated version of Facebook's patent to help lenders discriminate against borrowers based on social connections, isn't it? Which was the inspiration for the parody app, \"Unfriend the Poors.\" And maybe now isn't such a ridiculous idea after all in a reality where you'll probably want to unfriend your mom to raise your credit score before you click on that Facebook ad.  It's hard to keep writing these things off like some sort of idealistic upper class privilege gone awry in a company that surely has tricked some good people into working there, but whose culture and rulebook defends holocaust denial as free speech. A company that is failing to curb a proliferation of users who advocate for, and until recently bought ads that endorse, soft-peddled ethnic cleansing. Just another of Facebook's naive evils cross-fading into another.  Facebook tells us that it considers itself a moral company. But we know. We know that Facebook upsets the moral order because it continues to act perilously, without impunity.  So what have we learned this week? We've learned that the working class that actually exists isn't anything like the fantasies and prejudices of affluent, sheltered Facebook employees. Like the ones who've been hoarding buildings in working-class San Francisco neighborhoods, putting local small business owners out of business.  And if they wanted to escape those fantasies and prejudices to find out what we're all really experiencing, their best bet would be to quit their jobs at Facebook and to go get actual working-class jobs (and be subjected to the other side of the Facebook experience as well).  It may not give them an actual clue. But at least we wouldn't have to put up with them destroying democracy and its foundational principle of equality anymore.

This is concerning because Facebook is, essentially, letting people's biases dictate how outlets are perceived by its algorithms.  The full Facebook news trustworthiness survey.    It its entirety. https://t.co/bd0qkkXGgN pic.twitter.com/oUvTZLNiyB \u2014 Alex Kantrowitz (@Kantrowitz) January 23, 2018  As reported by BuzzFeed News, Facebook has a \"trusted\" news source survey that consists of two simple questions: \"Do you recognize the following websites?\" and \"How much do you trust each of these domains?\" For the first one, the answers you can provide are a simple \"yes\" or \"no,\" while the latter gives you the options to reply with \"entirely,\" \"a lot,\" \"somewhat,\" \"barely\" or \"not at all.\" That doesn't seem like the best or most thorough way to judge editorial integrity. Not only that, but the survey doesn't take into account personal biases, leaving the system wide open to abuse. This is only going to encourage people to continue to live in a bubble of their own creation, where there's no room for information or opinions that challenge their worldview.  Facebook seems to think the benefit to its survey is that it's simple and straightforward, though that's actually why it's so misguided. There's no room for nuance or additional context. How many people will say they don't trust the New York Times or CNN simply because President Donald Trump calls them \"Fake News\" any chance he gets? Sure, those particular outlets shouldn't have any problem being recognized as legit, but even labeling them as such doesn't seem like it's a responsibility Facebook's willing to take on. A Facebook spokesperson said to Engadget that Facebook is a platform for people to \"gain access to an ideologically diverse set of views,\" adding the following:  We surveyed a vast, broadly representative range of people (which helps -- among other measures -- to prevent the gaming-of-the-system or abuse issue you noted) within our Facebook community to develop the roadmap to these changes -- changes that are not intended to directly impact any specific groups of publishers based on their size or ideological leanings. Instead, we are making a change so that people can have more from their favorite sources and more from trusted sources. I'd also add that this is one of many signals that go into News Feed ranking. We do not plan to release individual publishers' trust scores because they represent an incomplete picture of how each story's position in each person's feed is determined.  \"There's too much sensationalism, misinformation and polarization in the world today,\" Zuckerberg said in Facebook post announcing the News Feed changes. \"Social media enables people to spread information faster than ever before, and if we don't specifically tackle these problems, then we end up amplifying them. That's why it's important that News Feed promotes high quality news that helps build a sense of common ground.\"  The problem is that, by letting its users control how the system works, Facebook may actually end up amplifying the fake news bubble it helped create. Facebook users were instrumental in the spreading of misinformation and Russian propaganda during the 2016 US Presidential election. According to its own data over 125 million Americans had been exposed to Kremlin-sponsored pages on Facebook.  \"The hard question we've struggled with is how to decide what news sources are broadly trusted in a world with so much division,\" Zuckerberg added. He said that Facebook could try to make that decision itself, but that \"that's not something we're comfortable with.\"", "stock": "FB", "label": 1, "date": "2018-01-24", "source": "engadget", "url": "https://www.engadget.com/2018/01/24/facebook-trusted-news-survey/"}, {"article": "Facebook is also prioritizing visual messaging, from further investment in real-time video to improving GIF, sticker and image options within Messenger.

The company is also putting more emphasis on companies that use Messenger to reach their users, whether by using it for customer service or marketing.  Considering Facebook's massive user base, it isn't surprising that Messenger is widely used. The company cites 1.3 billion monthly active users of Messenger, as well as a noted rise of visual communication through GIFs and emoji.

Actions that, despite Facebook's pearl-clutching in the press, are starting to look more and more in concert.  To be clear, Facebook knew what Cambridge Analytica did, but only (partly) acted on it when the press made it public knowledge. It was more than two years ago -- December 2015 -- when The Guardian published its first report about Cambridge Analytica using Facebook data to target US voters. Facebook didn't suspend them until last Friday. Cambridge Analytica maintained its access for years, while one of its chief officers worked at Facebook -- and while Facebook employees were embedded in the Trump campaign's digital media operation.  Keep in mind that Trump won by well-placed Electoral College votes: 77,744 to be precise. Before Cambridge Analytica came along, Trump had \"no unifying data, digital and tech strategy,\" according to leaks made public today by The Guardian. With its Facebook data, they ran Facebook ads disguised as news stories, linked to fake news sites, and targeted Facebook users they deemed especially susceptible. Then Cambridge Analytica tracked those Facebook users across the internet and re-targeted them. Russia's trolls did the rest, providing all the confirmation and social proof needed.  So, long after Facebook knew that Cambridge Analytica had mined data from millions of unwitting users, a Facebook board member (Thiel) gave $1 million to a PAC that was paying the company that covertly harvested user data.    ... from Facebook. https://t.co/osOJDj3Wx7 \u2014 Caroline O. (@RVAwonk) March 22, 2018  When the The Guardian's 2015 article came out, Facebook pretended to care.  \"And then,\" former Cambridge Analytica employee Christopher Wylie told The Observer, \"all they did was write a letter.  \"But literally all I had to do was tick a box and sign it and send it back, and that was it,\" says Wylie. \"Facebook made zero effort to get the data back.\"  Over the weekend, press characterized Wylie as a whistleblower. Which I suppose is easy to do if we're going to forget where all of this data dealing and vote-influencing has led -- the indisputable rise of hate groups in the US since the 2016 election, Facebook's churning cauldron of racist communities and deadly Nazi rallies, among others. Writer Joseph Guthrie tweeted, \"If I ever meet Chris Wylie, there will be no pleasantries. This isn't something you can apologise for and we all just move on. The price paid is too great a cost to ignore and again: assuming he's a queer man like I am, his involvement in this thing is a catastrophic betrayal.\"  Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie  It wasn't until the NYT and The Observer prepared to publish their articles last Friday that Facebook decided to suspend Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie from the platform -- in a weak attempt to get ahead of the story. Even then, it was after Facebook made legal threats against both NYT and The Observer in an effort to silence both publications.  So it was well-known internally at Facebook years ago that Cambridge Analytica extracted a lot of seriously sensitive user data through Facebook APIs, then used it for precision ad targeting (which Facebook could've vetted). It speaks volumes about Facebook -- and all its efforts to distract from this issue -- that it allowed a huge amount of sensitive data to get into the hands of unauthorized third parties ... and took years to take any action other than pinky swears.  It almost goes without saying that this whole sickening affair is more proof we didn't need that Facebook only cares when it is forced to: When the company decides it has a reputation problem. Which is the only problem they actually care about fixing. Other than that, it's all about creating more data dealer WMDs, like Facebook's impending patent to determine social class, which we can all assume will be abused until press who can afford to stand up to Facebook write an article about it.  But when you're Facebook, victimhood is performative.  A Facebook spokesperson released a statement Tuesday saying \"the entire company is outraged we were deceived.\" Obviously. They were so paralyzed by rage that they couldn't even bring themselves to do anything about it for over two years. During which time they rolled out several \"upgrades\" to their privacy systems and terms, and rolled out \"enhanced\" features to improve the experience. They were so mad they even hired the Global Science Research officer that sold Cambridge Analytica's users' data.  Bogglingly, the official Facebook response on Wednesday began with the sentence, \"Protecting people's information is the most important thing we do at Facebook. What happened with Cambridge Analytica was a breach of Facebook's trust.\"  Wednesday was also the day of Mark Zuckerberg's carefully crafted mea culpa press tour. It was an afternoon masterclass on softball interviews. No questions about knowingly hiring Cambridge Analytica's Joseph Chancellor. No queries about threatening to sue The Observer to prevent the information from getting out. You know, the whole reason he's sitting there being interviewed. It was almost like everyone at CNN, WIRED, Re/Code and NYT wanted Zuckerberg to feel safe. Comfortable. Far away from accepting anything like liability. Giving him a voice with which to explain his feelings of betrayal and all about his determination to do better while effectively changing nothing.  When the only thing that actually changed is people found out about it.  I particularly loved WIRED's feel of a chat over coffee, asking Zuckerberg what \"philosophical changes\" have been going through his mind lately. He got to say how, gosh, he really wishes he didn't have to deal with making decisions about content that promotes opposition of gender and racial equality. Which he shamelessly believes is a diverse and underserved point of view. As if fairness means incorporating, if not humoring and tolerating, ruinous disinformation campaigns, the beliefs of white nationalists, neo-Nazis, and fascists working for the most disastrous president in US history.  \"A lot of the most sensitive issues that we face today are conflicts between real values, right? Freedom of speech, and hate speech and offensive content. Where is the line?\" he said to Re/Code. \"What I would really like to do is find a way to get our policies set in a way that reflects the values of the community so I am not the one making those decisions.\"  Yep. While his company is the world leader in content censorship of art, human sexuality, and black activists, Mark Zuckerberg literally never imagined he'd someday be in the position to do the right thing about hate speech. And wishes he didn't have to.  That Facebook only pretends to care -- in the ways least affecting its business model -- isn't new. Nor is that the company is having yet another (temporary) \"come to Jesus\" moment about honesty when its hand is forced. Apology tours are its speciality.  Look, Zuckerberg did say sorry -- that they \"let the community down.\" It felt just as real as all of Facebook's regular apologies over the past ten years or so. I can't wait for the next one.  Zuckerberg also shored up his assurances to press this week by stating that Facebook would be beefing up its security team. He said, \"We're going to have 20,000 people working on security and content review in this company by the end of this year.\"  Facebook can hire all the security it wants. It won't do anything to protect us from Facebook.

Some historians and scientists are coming to understand that the internet\u2014and specifically Facebook\u2014are only the latest examples of the revolution-spawning networks, common throughout history, that give rise to hierarchies that both empower and oppress.  In an indictment released Friday, special prosecutor Robert Mueller described a scenario in which Russian operatives allegedly exploited Facebook with the intent of influencing the 2016 U.S. election. That Facebook could be used in this way should be no surprise, because research has shown that the downside of powerful, centralized networks is their susceptibility to being subverted and exploited.

That view, said historian Niall Ferguson, author of the 2018 book \u201cThe Square and the Tower: Networks and Power, From the Freemasons to Facebook,\u201d was born of an all-too-common mistake: the failure to appreciate that, even when new technologies come along, it\u2019s still humans who are using them.  \u201cFrom 1990s slogans about how we\u2019re all \u2018netizens\u2019 to the recent Facebook talk of a global community, we\u2019ve heard this argument ad nauseam,\u201d Mr. Ferguson said. \u201cAnd I think it has slightly robbed us of our critical faculties.\u201d  Understanding why this happens\u2014why networks start out as distributed power structures but quickly become vertical hierarchies capable of rapidly disseminating both information and propaganda\u2014requires a little network theory and some historical perspective.  A woman surrounded by images of Vladimir Lenin at \u2018The Epoch of Lenin\u2019 a private museum in Polotsk, Belarus, owned by collector Nikolai Pankrat, in October. Photo: sergei gapon/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images  Take the Bolshevik revolutions of 1917, for instance. The coalition of the armed forces and the industrial workforce that overthrew the czar was, essentially, a distributed network. But the circle of insiders who subsequently consolidated power over the Communist Party\u2014whose control peaked with the rule of Joseph Stalin\u2014is the hierarchy.  \u201cA hierarchy is just a special kind of network where some nodes have higher centrality\u2014the ones through which others have to communicate or pass,\u201d Mr. Ferguson said.  Technology usually plays a role in revolutionary change. In Russia, it was telegraphs and railroads. In the case of the Reformation, the printing press allowed for the rapid spread of the Bible in local languages. The distributed network of believers posed a sudden threat to the established Catholic hierarchy, yet once Protestantism achieved critical mass, its own hierarchy arose.  With the printed vernacular bible, Martin Luther envisioned a network of believers in Europe but not 200 years of civil war. Photo: ullstein bild/Getty Images  \u201cLuther thought that it would be great if everyone was connected and could read the Bible in the vernacular,\u201d Mr. Ferguson said. What Luther didn\u2019t anticipate is what would come next\u2014nearly 200 years of civil war.  \u201cWhat happened in the 16th century in Europe is visible in American politics today, where you have two pretty hostile and separate spheres of conservatives and liberals who are scarcely communicating across a largely vacated middle,\u201d Mr. Ferguson said.  To see how the power of nation- or globe-spanning networks can be exploited, look at China\u2019s transformation of its internet into the world\u2019s most sophisticated machine for censorship, surveillance and social control.  The distributed nature of the internet should have posed a major threat to a country like China. As internet activist John Gilmore once said, \u201cThe net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it.\u201d  Recognizing this, China built its portion of the internet from the start as a hierarchy in which internet companies can only rent bandwidth from government-controlled service providers. In other words, all traffic is routed through a limited number of powerful, central nodes.  China's President Xi Jinping is seen on a screen in front of logos of China's leading internet companies at the World internet Conference in Wuzhen, in China\u2019s Zhejiang province, in December. Photo: aly song/Reuters  Even when networks aren\u2019t architected for this kind of control, they tend to organize themselves in ways that lead to disproportionate influence by a handful of their members. When any new person or entity joins a network, it is likely to attach to the most visible hubs, making them even more influential, said Albert-L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Barab\u00e1si, a theoretical physicist and a founder of the field of network science.  In just a few years, Facebook became the world\u2019s most dominant conduit of news and information but said it would remain neutral to what spread through its channels. Meanwhile, a handful of engineers were building algorithms to decide which of its 2.2 billion users would see what.  By remaining agnostic about which influencers rose to popularity, and helping them along by building recommendation and newsfeed algorithms to enhance that popularity, Facebook allowed Russia to rapidly gain influence on the site, said Nicholas Christakis, a physician and sociologist at Yale who studies social networks.  The company has taken steps to address these problems, but it\u2019s Facebook\u2019s \u201coriginal sin\u201d\u2014to optimize for engagement above all else as a servant of advertisers as much as of users\u2014that is at the root of its issues, Dr. Christakis said.  According to Dr. Christakis, \u201cYou can connect a group of people one way and they\u2019re kind, and cooperation spreads. But if you take the same group of people and connect them in a different way, they\u2019re mean sons of bitches, and they\u2019re cruel to each other.\u201d  Facebook isn\u2019t the only internet power structure like this, of course. All the top social networks that use algorithmic feeds to feature content have been exploited in similar ways. Alphabet Inc.\u2019s YouTube recently came under fire for allowing its artificial intelligence to promote extremist views. And in Friday\u2019s indictment, Mr. Mueller named Twitter Inc. and Facebook-owned Instagram as well.  Historically, the only way to deal with this problem has been to disrupt an established network with a fresh one. Fostering competition could shift power away from Facebook. Yet many have begun to argue that Facebook, with its dominance of social media, should be treated as a monopoly, and even broken up. One could argue that the grounds for doing so now include national security.

Investors are apparently shocked that big tech companies that have long received political protection from liberals are suddenly getting the Big Oil rubdown.  Over the weekend two newspapers reported that the political firm Cambridge Analytica harvested data from 50 million Facebook users by using a personality test app. Ted Cruz used the firm in 2015 to target voters, and the Trump campaign later marshalled its \u201cpsychographic\u201d modelling\u2014a meld of social science and psychology.  The Obama campaign pioneered using Facebook data to boost turnout. Facebook itself exploits personal information, and its data trove is why it captures nearly 20% of the digital advertising market. But Cambridge Analytica may have misrepresented its purpose to users and Facebook, a violation of the platform\u2019s policy. Politicians are outraged nonetheless. During the Obama years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies enjoyed a halo effect. But since Donald Trump\u2019s election, Democrats have discovered that tech can be used for malicious purposes\u2014such as helping Donald Trump. Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar and California Rep. Adam Schiff have called for an investigation of Facebook data controls, and more political scrutiny is sure to come. This week the Senate is expected to pass legislation that would allow trial lawyers and state attorneys general to charge internet companies for allegedly abetting sex-trafficking. This represents an erosion of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which shields companies like Facebook and Google from liability for crimes committed by their users. It\u2019s only a matter of time before other crimes are exempted from Section 230. Mr. Trump is no fan of Big Tech, so watch out if Democrats win Congress. The European Commission this week also plans to propose a tax on digital ad revenue and the sale of digital data to third parties. This could slam U.S. tech profits, especially if lawmakers in Washington follow. Facebook doesn\u2019t deserve all of the flogging it\u2019s getting, but welcome to the club of business political risks.

Corporate consultants would normally regard such communication as sub-optimal, but today\u2019s late rally on Wall Street suggests that investors are looking beyond the bit fight. The Journal reports:  The pullbacks were the result of bad publicity. Separately the Journal explains why investors are willing to overlook a lot of bad headlines among the technology companies in the S&P 500:  They are expected to post 22% earnings growth in the first quarter, which would be a strong showing even for a sector that typically grows its earnings quite rapidly.  Much of the media has lately been having fun pretending that a company called Cambridge Analytica, making unauthorized use of personal data from Facebook, played an important role in persuading people to vote for Donald Trump in 2016.  In recent trading sessions, the dubious argument has had real consequences as investors have marked down the value of Facebook and other tech companies by billions of dollars. The thesis among sellers of such stocks is that the Washington swamp will now impose expensive regulation to punish Facebook for allegedly being useful to Mr. Trump. Buyers of the stock figure that Facebook can accommodate new rules and may even benefit if regulation erects barriers to new competitors. The joke circulating among Harvard alumni is that at least their old schoolmate Mark Zuckerberg won\u2019t be President now.  At the moment the Facebook founder and CEO doesn\u2019t even seem like a viable candidate to run for president of the Silicon Valley chamber of commerce. Bloomberg reports:  Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg has found himself with few defenders in the technology industry.  Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook, Tesla Inc.\u2019s Elon Musk and Salesforce.com Inc.\u2019s Marc Benioff have criticized the social media network in the wake of its user data scandal involving political-advertising firm Cambridge Analytica. Other tech leaders have remained quiet in the ensuing backlash against Facebook, in contrast to Silicon Valley\u2019s usual practice of rallying around its own during major crises.  Apple\u2019s Mr. Cook has offered perhaps the sharpest critique of Facebook\u2019s data collection, saying last week: \u201cThe truth is, we could make a ton of money if we monetized our customer \u2014 if our customer was our product. We\u2019ve elected not to do that.\u201d  In an interview posted this week on Vox, a website for young adults, Mr. Zuckerberg responded by comparing Facebook\u2019s advertiser-supported service which doesn\u2019t charge users to the Apple business model of charging consumers premium prices for hardware:  You know, I find that argument, that if you\u2019re not paying that somehow we can\u2019t care about you, to be extremely glib and not at all aligned with the truth. The reality here is that if you want to build a service that helps connect everyone in the world, then there are a lot of people who can\u2019t afford to pay. And therefore, as with a lot of media, having an advertising-supported model is the only rational model that can support building this service to reach people.  ...if you want to build a service which is not just serving rich people, then you need to have something that people can afford.  It seems that Mr. Zuckerberg will continue to offer an affordable service--assuming consumers don\u2019t regard sharing their personal information as too high a price to pay for social media. Speaking of costs and benefits, Mr. Zuckerberg makes clear in his Vox interview that Facebook is becoming a more aggressive media gatekeeper:  In 2016, we were behind having an understanding and operational excellence on preventing things like misinformation, Russian interference. And you can bet that\u2019s a huge focus for us going forward...  After the 2016 US elections, a number of months later, there were the French elections. And for that, we spent a bunch of time developing new AI tools to find the kind of fake accounts spreading misinformation and we took down \u2014 I think it was more than 30,000 accounts, and I think the reports out of France were that people felt like that was a much cleaner election on social media.  A few months later, there were the German elections. And there, we augmented the playbook again to work directly with the election commission in Germany. If you work with the government in a country, they\u2019ll really actually have a fuller understanding of what is going on and what are all the issues that we would need to focus on.  The idea of Facebook working with governments around the world to filter news is more frightening than almost any commercial use of user data one can imagine.  In a recent letter to the editor of this newspaper, Rodger Cornell of Kinsale, Va. no doubt speaks for many readers in addressing new proposals to filter Internet content on services like Facebook:  During most of my adult life the news that I received was indeed filtered, in most instances by liberal newspaper editors.

Now the mobs are howling after Facebook , Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s creature.  It is true that Facebook\u2019s release of personal \u201cfriend data\u201d into the ozone through Cambridge Analytica remains in the news only because of the prevailing superstition that the Facebook monster allowed Donald Trump to be elected president. The idea that omnipotent technology manipulated the 2016 election has greater appeal to advanced progressive thinking than Hillary Clinton\u2019s explanation that married white women sold her out.  But really, all that is a sideshow. The backlash against this technology, the belief that the creature must be controlled, has been building for several years. Along with Google, Facebook is the biggest web target, so Mark Zuckerberg is about to get torched by Congress and any regulator within reach for abusing \u201cdata.\u201d  Data is the oxygen of the internet. Any online click for any reason inputs data. In the beginning this data, organized into things like family Facebook groups or Google Maps or Wikipedia, was seen as good.  For several years BTTP\u2014BTTP being human history Before The Trump Presidency \u2014articles and books poured forth describing the dark side of this technology. In the past year, that criticism has reached critical mass.  Researchers and parents agree that social media is distorting the lives of young people, especially adolescent girls. No one knows what to do about it.  Web forums fill with millions of young men exchanging sexual and political rants. No one knows what to do about it.  Terrorists wallow in jihadist videos on YouTube, brainwashing themselves into acts of mass murder. No one knows what to do about it.  People write articles saying they have forgotten how to read books.  Major advertisers accuse social-media companies of allowing their ads to appear alongside pornography, a bog beyond anyone\u2019s control.  The cyberwarfare spies of Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency ran around the U.S. uncaught for years.  Social media\u2019s contribution to the Arab Spring and Ukraine\u2019s Orange Revolution was an era ago. The technology has been captured since by dictators who use it as an instrument of surveillance and control that would startle Philip K. Dick.  In one week, Facebook the good communitarian has become Facebook the abuser of everyone\u2019s privacy.  The story of Frankenstein endures as a metaphor of good intentions gone haywire because it keeps happening. Some people used to argue that because Albert Einstein explained how energy could be released from atoms, he bore responsibility for the atomic bomb. By this logic blame should fall on Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, for electing Donald Trump.  Do not for a moment think that Mr. Zuckerberg, Mr. Berners-Lee or any of the others who created modern life online are unaware that history may conclude their creations were a mistake.  Mr. Berners-Lee, reacting to the Facebook mess, accused social-media companies of abusing his creation: \u201cThe fact that power is concentrated among so few companies has made it possible to weaponize the web at scale.\u201d  \u201cWeaponize\u201d evokes the idea of dual-use technology, which is tech that can be put to both a peaceful and military purpose, such as rocket guidance systems. The internet has finally been recognized as a dual-use technology, good and bad.  Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s CEO and inheritor of Steve Jobs\u2019s creations, weighed in this week, ironically from China, the global leader in Orwellian surveillance systems. \u201cThe ability of anyone to know what you\u2019ve been browsing about for years,\u201d said Mr. Cook, \u201cwho your contacts are, who their contacts are, things you like and dislike and every intimate detail of your life\u2014from my own point of view it shouldn\u2019t exist.\u201d Of course, the iPhone became the universal gateway into this dystopia.  One can imagine that when Sergey Brin and Larry Page created Google\u2019s early motto, \u201cDon\u2019t Be Evil,\u201d they sensed what Robert Oppenheimer and his colleagues on the Manhattan Project knew: The power of what they had created might be a problem.  Back when superstition ruled the world, the solution to a larger-than-life problem was known as forcing the genie back into the bottle. Today, when algorithms rule the world, one would think that an industry with aggregate IQ greater than any ever assembled could figure this out. But maybe IQ correlates with the problem.  If the issue is privacy, why does every app and site incentivize users to scroll past pages of legal boilerplate to hit \u201cI Agree,\u201d rather than writing up top in large type: \u201cTHIS IS THE ONE SENTENCE YOU\u2019VE GOTTA THINK ABOUT BEFORE YOU AGREE\u201d?  There is another alternative to trying to dam up the internet torrent with regulation: Every time anyone clicks into an app or search engine, they should see this more needed personal motto for our times: Don\u2019t Be Stupid.

I was in New York with the fall term\u2019s last classes to teach, so I compartmentalized. I didn\u2019t learn he had died until I arrived home at 10:30.  Stunned, I checked to see whether my family had announced our loss. Hours earlier, an acquaintance had posted on my Facebook page: \u201cSorry about your dad.\u201d Others sent condolences privately, but still before I had heard the news. Turned out, everyone had read my 20-year-old nephew Sam\u2019s poignant tribute at 7 p.m.: \u201cThank you for all you have given, Grandpa.\u201d  The speedy digital death messages that night felt devastating. I appreciated everyone\u2019s desire to connect, but there are more-sensitive ways to sympathize online:  Photo: istock/Getty Images  \u2022 Slow down. If you hear of a death secondhand, don\u2019t race to call, text or post.

Paper cards may be more thoughtful anyway.  \u2022 Don\u2019t waste money. With broke friends, I\u2019ve sent a check or donated directly to cover burial costs. That wasn\u2019t our case. Flowers and food baskets are generous, but my family preferred all donations to go to the needy. My parents grew up poor, dad a street kid on New York\u2019s Lower East Side. His pride was putting his four kids through college and arranging educational trusts for his grandkids. I finally posted a few of his charities on Facebook: the medical school where he taught and a Hasidic nonprofit that helps kids with special needs. Since my conservative father and I argued politics (he characterized my candidate, Hillary, and her husband as \u201cBonnie and Clyde,\u201d while I called his \u201cDrumpf\u201d), I added the Israel Defense Forces, our shared passion, as a concession. When notices of donations came in, I cherished them as if dad were still doing good in the world.  \u2022 No advice. After we chose Sunday for the funeral, I completed my classes and attended a long-scheduled academic panel. Dad, a fellow workaholic, loved my teaching (\u201cfinally a real job!\u201d). Several people suggested I cancel, bury him sooner, or have a separate Manhattan shiva. Unless you\u2019re asked, hold your opinion.  \u2022 Forget yourself and your loss. Well-wishers updated me on their dads\u2019 ages and sicknesses, as if competing in the Grief Olympics. One said she couldn\u2019t attend the service because of her father\u2019s recovery. A co-worker compared it to losing her cat. Try \u201cSorry to hear\u201d or \u201cSending love.\u201d  \u2022 Respond to what\u2019s shared. Cyberspace helped me mourn. The chapel taped and offered a link to dad\u2019s memorial, which I posted. I loved when out-of-towners commented on my eulogy, adding their own recollections. Our old neighbor, David, recalled Dad rushing over when he fell sick at 3 a.m. That made me feel closer to my father, Jack Shapiro, a Leo born under a lucky star. Tagging him reminded me that my staid 85-year-old dad was on Facebook, where he\u2019ll live forever, my political foe and eternal friend.

Facebook has struggled to respond to mounting ire from users, politicians, customers and others over its role in facilitating the spread of misinformation and divisive content. Photo: Paul Sakuma/Associated Press  Facebook Inc. FB 0.40% is contending with a new wave of criticism prompted by the U.S. indictment alleging that Russia manipulated social-media platforms\u2014and by a Facebook executive\u2019s attempts to address the issue.  The indictment against Russian companies and individuals described how an organization called the Internet Research Agency allegedly used Facebook, Twitter Inc., TWTR -0.83% and the YouTube arm of Alphabet Inc.\u2019s GOOGL -0.12% Google to sow discord in the U.S. starting in 2014. The document\u2019s description of events showed that Facebook and its Instagram photo-sharing unit were particularly central to the alleged Russian attempts to influence U.S. public opinion.  Researchers who study social media said the indictment, secured by special counsel Robert Mueller, showed that Facebook was ill-prepared for such efforts. Facebook has more than 25,000 employees, but fewer than 100 Russian provocateurs armed with social-media savvy and widely available technological tools were able to manipulate its platform for years, the indictment says.  Comments by Facebook\u2019s head of advertising, Rob Goldman, after the indictment was handed up Friday fueled further criticism. Mr. Goldman, writing on Twitter, said there are \u201ceasy ways to fight\u201d the Russian campaign, starting with having a \u201cwell educated citizenry.\u201d He also tweeted that the Russians\u2019 main goal wasn\u2019t to sway the 2016 election, but more broadly to sow division in the U.S.  Mr. Goldman\u2019s series of eight tweets provoked more than 9,000 responses on Twitter, many of them angry.  \u201cYou really are not in a position to preach and your astonishing tweets have created confusion and anger,\u201d Mainardo de Nardis, a senior executive at advertising giant Omnicom Group Inc., said in a tweet Sunday. \u201cEnough damage done over the past 2+ years. In the absence of real actions silence would be appreciated.\u201d Mr. de Nardis didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.  A Facebook spokesman said Mr. Goldman, who didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment, had sent his tweets in a personal capacity. The company pointed to a statement from Joel Kaplan, Facebook\u2019s vice president of global public policy, saying, \u201cNothing we found contradicts the Special Counsel\u2019s indictments.\u201d  Russia\u2019s government has repeatedly denied any government effort to influence the U.S. election.  Facebook has struggled for much of the past year to respond to mounting ire from users, politicians, customers and others over its role in facilitating the spread of misinformation and divisive content.  The indictment shows that \u201cthere are lots of levers that get pulled in social media for the sake of manipulation and a lot of those levers aren\u2019t even known by the companies themselves,\u201d said Sam Woolley, an Oxford University research associate who has studied propaganda efforts on social-media platforms.  The indictment documented an unprecedented manipulation campaign targeting Facebook, its Instagram platform, Twitter and YouTube. Starting in 2014, the Russians built an influence operation that drew followers to bogus accounts that spread disinformation, organized U.S. demonstrations and even paid a person to dress up like Hillary Clinton in a prison uniform at a West Palm Beach, Fla., rally, the indictment says.  While much of the attention around the Russian manipulation focused on its efforts to stoke divisions ahead the 2016 U.S. presidential election, it is clear the campaign continued since then. The Wall Street Journal reported in October that some of the Russian-backed social-media accounts posted divisive messages at least as recently as last August.  The Twitter comments of Mr. Goldman, Facebook\u2019s head of advertising, also fueled disagreement about the intent of the Russian efforts. One of Mr. Goldman\u2019s tweets said \u201cswaying the election was *NOT* the main goal\u201d of the Russian ads, and that \u201cthe majority of the Russian ad spend happened AFTER the election.\u201d  On Saturday, President Donald Trump cited Mr. Goldman\u2019s comment in support of the idea that Russia\u2019s actions didn\u2019t affect the election.  Following criticism that he was obscuring the intent of the Russians, Mr. Goldman later tweeted that \u201cthe Russian campaign was certainly in favor of Mr. Trump.\u201d He also dialed back some of his claims. \u201cI am only speaking here about the Russian behavior on Facebook. That is the only aspect that I observed directly,\u201d he tweeted.  Clint Watts, a fellow with the Foreign Policy Research Institute who studied the Russian influence campaign, said the ads bought on Facebook were only \u201ca much smaller part of a very large effort.\u201d  \u201cMr. Goldman should have stayed silent,\u201d Mr. Watts said, adding that playing down the effect of the influence campaign risked further angering Americans. \u201cThe public is upset that they got duped on Facebook\u2019s platform. Facebook got duped,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes it seem like they don\u2019t get it.\u201d  While Facebook\u2019s role in the Russian campaign is in the spotlight, some researchers who have studied the efforts note that it was far from the only institution to fall short.  \u201cLet\u2019s not mince words. The Obama administration did not react quickly enough to this problem. The intelligence community did not react quickly enough to this problem,\u201d said Thomas Rid, professor of strategic studies at Johns Hopkins University.  Facebook has said it is taking a number of steps to prevent efforts like the Russian campaign from happening again, including hiring 10,000 employees tasked with policing hate speech, as well as coming up with ways to uproot fake accounts. Facebook officials also have emphasized that the company provided information to Mr. Mueller.  Based on the information that's now coming out of congressional committees, Russian goals to interfere in the 2016 election were very broad. WSJ's Gerald F. Seib explains just how sophisticated the Russian efforts were using social media.

Still, his comments struck some observers as tone deaf.  \u201cIt was an almost perfect example of Silicon Valley overconfidence and lack of sophistication when it comes to politics,\u201d said Josh Hendler, former director of technology for the Democratic National Committee, which suffered a cyberattack ahead of the 2016 election that U.S. officials blamed on Russia.

Instagram, left, and Facebook, right, used to feel like two distinct digital experiences, but they feel increasingly similar as Instagram adopts Facebook-style recommendations and notifications. Shown, the apps on iPhone X screens. Photo: Emily Prapuolenis/The Wall Street Journal  I use Facebook , FB 0.40% like most people, but I often say my real self is on Instagram.  On Facebook, I share major life changes and links to articles I\u2019ve written. But that long, emotional post from the refugee camp in Greece where I volunteered? Or the picture where I\u2019m dressed up as the late Chicago Cubs announcer Harry Caray for Halloween? Instagram all the way.  Facebook Inc. has owned Instagram since 2012 but until recently the social network and the photo-sharing app have felt like distinct experiences. For years, Instagram was a haven from Facebook\u2019s annoying ads, creepy friend suggestions and viral clickbait. Meanwhile, Facebook has begun to draw fire as a potential menace to mental health and stable democracies alike.  So it\u2019s a little surprising that recent Instagram updates make it feel much more like its big brother. Sure, when Instagram has taken a page from Facebook\u2019s playbook in the past, it has paid off: Switching from a chronological feed to an algorithm increased engagement.  And Instagram\u2019s user base continues to grow. Monthly active users doubled to 800 million from February to September last year; the app had 500 million daily active users as of September.  But lately even Instagram\u2019s owner has acknowledged the distinction between a habitual user and a happy user. The latest updates may get people into Instagram more frequently, or for a longer time, but there\u2019s little to enjoy about them. Here\u2019s why I\u2019m falling out of love with one of my favorite apps.  Recommended Garbage  Part of what made Instagram great was that your main feed was a stream of things you wanted to see: pictures and videos from friends and accounts whose posts you enjoy. The Facebook-type noise\u2014stuff your friends had commented on, public chatter\u2014remained in other tabs you could click over to if you felt like it.  A few weeks ago, I was scrolling through Instagram, minding my own business, when a random picture of a man showed up, posted by an account I\u2019d never heard of. For a split second, I thought I was in someone else\u2019s account.  Photo: The Wall Street Journal  Starting in December, Instagram has been putting posts from people you don\u2019t follow right into your feed, under a \u201cRecommended for you\u201d banner.  They are sandwiched between your feed\u2019s new posts and previously viewed ones. If you tap the three dots on the right side of the banner, you can hide these posts temporarily, but you can\u2019t opt out of them entirely.  An Instagram spokeswoman said the feature \u201cmakes it easier to find relevant, high-quality content and accounts you wouldn\u2019t normally see but might enjoy.\u201d  Research has shown that when we see Facebook content from people we don\u2019t know, it can enhance the feeling that others are living better lives. One study found that when people used Facebook passively\u2014scrolling but not commenting, liking or posting\u2014their feelings of envy increased.  Even Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has weighed in: He recently told investors he wants the company \u201cto encourage meaningful social interactions.\u201d Instagram\u2019s recommended posts are the opposite of meaningful.  Post, Post, Ad  I can now make it through three new posts on Instagram before seeing an ad. After that, I get one every six to eight posts.  Instagram\u2019s spokeswoman confirmed ad load is up: \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to do this by improving the quality and the relevance of the ads.\u201d  But the ad load feels way up. According to the social advertising firm Brand Networks, clients delivered 17 times as many ad impressions on Instagram in 2017 as in 2016. The company, which works with brands including American Express Co. and Unilever PLC, expects Instagram impressions to grow by 25% in the first quarter of 2018, compared with the previous quarter.  Instagram may be free, but you\u2019re paying for it with your constantly interrupted attention.  Nowhere to Hide  Earlier this month, Instagram\u2019s direct messages started showing when users were last active.  Photo: The Wall Street Journal  While a lot of people are fine with such a feature\u2014closely related to the instant-message read receipt\u2014others feel it is intrusive. You can disable the feature in settings, but it\u2019s on by default.  The Instagram spokeswoman says the feature allows for \u201cmore of a real-time experience.\u201d  People reeled when Facebook made them download a separate Messenger app, which has since become larded up with too many such real-time features. That may be a harbinger of things to come for Instagram, which is testing a stand-alone camera-first messaging app in six countries outside the U.S.  People You Don\u2019t Want to Know  Facebook\u2019s \u201cPeople you may know\u201d feature, which suggests who you might want to friend, is known for being creepy. Facebook says suggestions are drawn from mutual friends, your networks and contacts you\u2019ve uploaded, among other criteria.  Instagram shares information with Facebook, and it turns out its follow suggestions are just as creepy.  How creepy? I created a fresh Instagram account with my work email and didn\u2019t sync it to Facebook. Still, 78 out of 100 recommendations were my Facebook friends.  The other 22 names were even more interesting. They looked like strangers. But you can get linked to people\u2014even borderline strangers\u2014who saved your email or phone number and synced their contacts to Facebook, which they\u2019ve linked to their Instagram. One of my suggested friends was an apartment broker I\u2019d emailed through Craigslist... in 2009. (Gizmodo actually built a People You May Know Inspector so you can study Facebook\u2019s seemingly mysterious links.)  Even when you don\u2019t upload your contacts directly to Instagram, the network uses information\u2014or \u201csignals,\u201d as Instagram calls them\u2014from Facebook, which might include contacts or other tangential information.  No Mo\u2019 Notifications  Now is not a bad time to go through your notification settings. Did you know that Instagram has 17 categories? Among them are notifications about which Facebook friends use Instagram. If you don\u2019t want to be bugged constantly about adding them, you can turn this off. Just remember: This won\u2019t stop Instagram from telling your Facebook friends that you\u2019re on the app.  You might want to shut off other notifications too, such as the one that says someone is posting for the first time in a while, or my personal favorite, the one that reminds you that you have unseen notifications.  On top of that, Facebook, Instagram and Messenger have been testing a cross-platform notification feature, which lets users see all alerts and hop between the apps.  I understand why Instagram is adopting Facebook features: They work. But for years I logged into Instagram and enjoyed it more than Facebook. I fear a day when I wake up, open my phone and can no longer tell the difference between the two.

The unexpected compensation arrangement - announced in the middle of the night in California - involves no salary or cash bonus but sets up rewards for Musk multiplying Tesla\u2019s market value as much as ten-fold to $650 billion over the next 10 years.  That ambitious target implies Tesla stock will grow by 1,000 percent over a decade, or about 27 percent per year, a feat achieved by only a handful of major U.S. companies recently, including Amazon.com Inc, Priceline Group Inc and Domino\u2019s Pizza Inc. Netflix has surged 6,600 percent in the past 10 years.  Tesla\u2019s current market value of $60 billion is about the same as General Motors Co, but far below Apple Inc\u2019s $921 billion.  The plan comes after Tesla\u2019s much-anticipated Model 3 sedan missed several production targets and as many on Wall Street expect the company to launch another round of capital raising.  \u201cWe see Elon Musk\u2019s ambitious long-term awards plan as an aspirational marketing tool to attract talent and capital ahead of an upward inflection in competition\u201d for electric and autonomous vehicles, said Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, who has been bullish on Tesla shares.  Musk could earn more than $70 billion in incremental compensation through the deal, Jonas estimated. Tesla itself put Musk\u2019s maximum gain at $55.8 billion.  With the new plan, Tesla effectively quietened speculation that Musk may be planning to quit as the targets require him to remain as chief executive or serve as both executive chairman and chief product officer.  Tesla noted, however, that the deal provides \u201cthe flexibility to bring in another CEO who would report to Elon at some point in the future.\u201d The company added that there was no current intention for this to happen.  Some investors worry that Musk\u2019s ambition to build Tesla into a behemoth will severely stretch its production capabilities, aggravating production delays and stretching Tesla\u2019s high cash burn rate.  Meanwhile, a host of global automakers from Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) to Ford Motor Co plan to introduce new electric vehicles into the marketplace in coming years, posing a major threat.  Tesla\u2019s shares, which gained 46 percent last year, closed 0.3 percent higher at $352.79.

Tesla/Handout via REUTERS  NEW TERMS  The new performance award consists of a 10-year grant of stock options that vest in 12 tranches tied to milestones.  The company\u2019s market value must increase to $100 billion for the first tranche to vest and must continue to increase in additional $50 billion increments for the remaining 11 tranches.  Musk, also Tesla\u2019s chairman, was an early investor in the company and is now its biggest shareholder, owning about a fifth of all shares outstanding.  He has founded several companies, including rocket maker SpaceX and The Boring Company - leading some to speculate that his interest in leading Tesla could eventually wane. His net worth is about $20 billion, according to Forbes.  Musk has vowed that Tesla will become \u201cthe best manufacturer on Earth,\u201d helped by a new, highly automated assembly line and a simpler design for its Model 3 sedan. However, production woes have slowed deliveries.  While Tesla\u2019s luxury Model S sedans and Model X SUVs have earned it a legion of fans for its technical innovations and respect from the automotive industry, it is the more mass-market Model 3 sedan that is key to the company\u2019s long-term viability.  The company said on Tuesday it must meet a set of escalating revenue and adjusted EBITDA targets for Musk to earn compensation tied to the operational milestones.  For each tranche, Musk will vest in stock options that correspond to about 1.69 million shares, or 1 percent of Tesla\u2019s current total outstanding shares.  The performance award was created by the company\u2019s board in consultation with third party compensation consultant Compensia Inc. It requires the approval of Tesla\u2019s shareholders.  Musk and his brother Kimbal did not participate in the more than six-month process. Shareholders, excluding the Musks, will be asked to vote on it in a special shareholder scheduled in late March.", "stock": "TSLA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-01-23", "source": "reuters", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-ceo/tesla-says-ceo-musk-to-get-paid-only-when-company-performs-well-idUSKBN1FC0VN"}, {"article": "LOS GATOS, California (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) said on Friday that a Tesla Model X involved a fatal crash in California last week had activated its Autopilot system, raising new questions about the semi-autonomous system that handles some driving tasks.

Trump\u2019s order, signed into law on Tuesday, imposes a 30 percent tariff on fully assembled imported solar panels as well as the cells of which the panels are made - a move intended to protect American jobs but which the solar industry worries will raise costs and trigger thousands of layoffs.  But in a twist destined to help the California company, the solar cell tariff only kicks in after 2.5 gigawatts worth hit U.S. shores each year.  Tesla uses solar cells in its nascent solar roof tile business. The tiles generate electricity without the need for a traditional panel. Tesla also has plans to build conventional panels using imported cells for its U.S.-based residential installation business, which it also hopes to grow over the coming years.  Tesla said on Tuesday it expects to be able to import \u201csome or all of our non-U.S. cells for Solar Roof and solar panel modules free of tariffs.\u201d  Only 500 MW worth of solar cells were imported into the United States in total last year, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, a fifth of what is being exempted from Trump\u2019s tariff.  Baird analyst Ben Kallo agreed the tariff was generally positive for Tesla as it will make its domestic products more competitive with imports - though he noted its installation business will pay higher prices for imported panels in the short term. Tesla shares rose $1.23, or 0.3 percent, to close at $352.79 on Tuesday.  Tesla had been part of a group of domestic manufacturers that lobbied against tariffs on solar products.

The Japanese luxury brands are fighting to gain ground in the U.S. luxury market as Volkswagen AG\u2019s (VOWG_p.DE) Audi brand and Mercedes-Benz have expanded sales, and Tesla has provided a fresh alternative to the established brands.  Last year the Lexus brand suffered a 7.6 percent slide in U.S. sales last year. At Honda Motor Co Ltd\u2019s (7267.T) Acura luxury brand, 2017 sales fell 3.9 percent from 2016. Nissan Motor Co Ltd\u2019s (7201.T) Infiniti pushed up sales by 11.3 percent, mainly by selling almost twice as many sport utility vehicles as cars. However, Infiniti\u2019s total 2017 sales of 153,415 vehicles put it behind the leading Germany luxury car brands, as well as Acura, Lexus and General Motors Co\u2019s (GM.N) Cadillac brand.  Lexus, Infiniti and Acura launched in the U.S. market in the late 1980s and took advantage of quality problems at Audi and a lack of innovation at the then-leading luxury brands in the market, General Motors Co\u2019s (GM.N) Cadillac and Ford Motor Co\u2019s (F.N) Lincoln brand.  Now, the structure of the U.S. luxury vehicle market has changed. Four brands - Daimler AG\u2019s (DAIGn.DE) Mercedes-Benz, BMW AG (BMWG.DE), Volkswagen\u2019s Audi brand and Lexus dominate sales in the U.S. luxury market.  Tesla, meanwhile, has gathered more than 400,000 orders for its Model 3 sedan, which is just starting to reach customers as the automaker tries to iron out production problems.  In Detroit, Infiniti showed a future sedan powered by a high efficiency gasoline engine.

Tesla tumbled 8.2 percent, or $25 a share, to close at $279.18, the lowest close in almost a year, after news of the investigation.  Late on Tuesday, Moody\u2019s Investors Service downgraded Tesla\u2019s credit rating to B3 from B2. Moody\u2019s said the ratings \u201creflect the significant shortfall in the production rate of the company\u2019s Model 3 electric vehicle.\u201d It also \u201cfaces liquidity pressures due to its large negative free cash flow and the pending maturities of convertible bonds.\u201d  Tesla shares fell another 2.6 percent in after-hours trading.

The lower-than-expected deliveries and production will intensify the debate over Musk\u2019s ability to deliver on his quest to bring electric cars to the masses. Mounting liquidity pressures and challenges with Model 3 production prompted Moody\u2019s Investors Service last week to cut the carmaker\u2019s credit rating further into junk status, adding fuel to a selloff of the company\u2019s bonds to all-time lows.

Tesla.  Does Elon Musk control Tesla Inc.? Colloquially speaking, sure he does: He is Tesla's chief executive officer, the chairman of its board and its largest shareholder. He is also its co-founder, even though he didn't found it, which is a hard trick to pull off at a company that you don't control.  But there is also a narrower question, which is: Is Elon Musk the controlling shareholder of Tesla? That is less obvious. He owns about 22 percent of the stock, which is rather less than a majority, and it's all just normal stock, with no super-voting rights or anything. This narrower question matters because, under Delaware law (Tesla is a Delaware company), there are limits on what a controlling shareholder can do to enrich himself at the expense of a company that he controls. For instance, when Tesla acquired SolarCity Corp. in 2016, when Musk was SolarCity's chairman and largest shareholder (and his cousin was its CEO), and when SolarCity was financially troubled and needed to be bailed out by someone, that looked, to a lot of people, like kind of an awkward transaction.  But Delaware law does not have a category for \"kind of an awkward transaction.\" It has basically two relevant categories: If Musk was the controlling shareholder of Tesla, and caused Tesla to buy SolarCity, then a judge will review the transaction for \"entire fairness\" and, if he finds that the process or price was unfair, he can award damages for shareholders against Musk and the directors. But if Musk was not the controlling shareholder -- if he was just a CEO who happened to own some shares, and who was answerable to the board of directors and shareholders -- then the board's decision to buy SolarCity is subject to \"business judgment\" review, which basically means that the board can do whatever it wants. (Also even if he was the controlling shareholder, he could have avoided entire fairness review \"if at the outset of a self-dealing transaction the controlling stockholder effectively relinquished control over the outcome to an independent committee of disinterested directors and a nonwaivable, fully informed vote of a majority of the minority stockholders.\")  So is he the controlling shareholder? Yesterday a Delaware judge ruled on a motion to dismiss a shareholder lawsuit over the SolarCity deal and decided that it's a \"close call\" but that Musk might have controlled Tesla, so the lawsuit can go forward. The reasons for Musk's control are all the sort of obvious things: He owns a lot of shares, not a majority but enough to sway the vote; he dominates the board of directors and, in particular, dominated the board's discussion of the proposed SolarCity deal (bringing it to the board three times, and curiously never discussing the possibility of buying another solar company instead of SolarCity); he \"has demonstrated a willingness to facilitate the ouster of senior management when displeased\"; and he is central to the company's business, raising money for it and acting as its public face and authoring its \"Master Plan.\" (And while Tesla did require a majority of the non-Musk shareholders to approve the deal, and allowed independent directors to negotiate the price -- which I thought was rather good governance, considering -- Musk was fully involved in the board decisions about whether to do the deal.) You can't really object too much to that conclusion. Intuitively, Tesla is Musk's company, while also being a public company, and using a public company you control to bail out another public company that you also control seems like the sort of thing that controlling-shareholder rules are supposed to be suspicious of.  Still it's a little weird. Musk is the charismatic founder-CEO-visionary of Tesla, sure. But he owns 22 percent of the shares, with 22 percent of the vote. Plenty of other tech-company founder-CEO-visionaries have found much stronger ways to formalize their perpetual control. Mark Zuckerberg owns about 16 percent of the shares of Facebook Inc., but he controls almost 60 percent of the vote, and almost got the company to give him voting control forever even if he sells more of his stock. Evan Spiegel and Robert Murphy are the charismatic founder-visionaries of Snap Inc.; they own less than 40 percent of the stock between them, but control more than 88 percent of the vote. Meanwhile, just being a founder-CEO-visionary who dominates the board, has the ideas, and is the public face of the company is not necessarily enough to keep control, as Travis Kalanick can tell you. The voting power usually doesn't matter, when things are good for the founder-CEO-visionary, but when it matters it matters.  There seem to be two models of governance in large technology companies run by founder-visionaries: There is the founder-visionary-CEO as perpetual owner and controlling shareholder, who jealously guards his rights so that he can't be unseated by insurgent shareholders or directors, and there is the founder-visionary-CEO who actually does give shareholders a vote, and who relies on his charisma and vision to keep the shareholders and directors in line. Those models often come to more or less the same place, but they don't always; Musk has to wake up every day and persuade his shareholders and directors that his charismatic vision is the right one, in a way that Zuckerberg just doesn't. It's a little rough on Musk that he's not actually the controlling shareholder and the law treats him like he is anyway.  In other Tesla news, its bonds are cratering. \"You can see quickly that Tesla is singularly unsuited to using debt,\" wrote Aswath Damodaran back in August, when it was issuing debt. But \"bond investors pretty much ignored the carmaker\u2019s prolific cash burn and repeated failures to meet production targets and lent it $1.8 billion at record-low interest rates.\" I guess investors saw the unsuitability slowly: The bonds \"plunged to a low of 86 cents on the dollar\" yesterday, and Moody's Investors Service downgraded them to a Caa1 rating this week. I have to say that as I spend time this month reading financial-crisis anniversary pieces, I cannot get that worked up about a low-junk-rated money-losing company's bonds trading down to a 7.8 percent yield. As these things go, that's still pretty good.  A warning shot.  How are things at Deutsche Bank AG? Oh great, great, except that it has been widely reported that Chairman Paul Achleitner has grown tired of Chief Executive Officer John Cryan and is openly searching for his replacement. Yesterday Cryan sent out a staff memo saying that he is \"absolutely committed\" to staying, which is not quite the question that was being asked:  \u201cThe fact that Cryan must write his own defense and doesn\u2019t get any backing from Achleitner is a sign of weakness for the CEO,\u201d said Florian Sauerburger, a portfolio manager at Aramea Asset Management, which owns Deutsche Bank stock.  It's true. It rather seems like the intended audience for the memo was Achleitner and the board, and that its message was \"back off.\" \"We need to focus on executing on the strategy that was agreed and signed off by both the management and supervisory boards,\" wrote Cryan, who mentioned the \"destabilizing effect\" of \"widespread rumors\" and urged, \"Let\u2019s not allow ourselves to be thrown off course.\" They're all employee-appropriate sentiments, I guess, but also interpretable as an argument that the noisy search for his replacement should quiet down. Meanwhile there is this:  The person close to Mr Achleitner stressed that replacing Mr Cryan \u201cis not a foregone conclusion at this point\u201d, adding that the chief executive should take the debate as \u201ca warning shot\u201d and redouble efforts to cut costs.  Is that a thing? Is it normal for a board of directors to go around noisily auditioning replacements for their CEO in order to light a fire under the incumbent? It seems rather tough for the incumbent's authority, not to mention his morale. Anyway as long as Cryan is still around he is going to do what he does, which is make cuts at the investment bank, though there too Deutsche seems to be of two minds about everything:  As part of the investment bank review, cuts are being discussed at both big trading businesses -- equities as well as fixed income, currencies and commodities -- because they are expensive and haven\u2019t performed well, said one person. However, the extent of a potential retrenchment is unclear because many traders just got big bonuses in an effort to retain top performers, this person said.  I have to say that getting a big retention bonus and then immediately being laid off is ... not the worst way to go.  The crypto.  Here is a profile of Zhao Changpeng, the founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance, who spent \"several years developing trading systems for companies including Bloomberg L.P.,\" and who is now maybe a billionaire, but who has apparently never met a lawyer? Or something, I don't know, what do you make of this explanation for why Binance lists so many initial coin offerings that have characteristics of unregistered securities:  Zhao said the exchange\u2019s client identification policies are similar to those of some U.S.-based venues and that Binance takes a venture capital-like approach to evaluating the coins it lists, favoring those that are backed by teams with a track record and real products. He also asks issuers to provide Binance with a legal opinion that the coins aren\u2019t securities.  Look. The way venture capital works is that it invests in companies, specifically by buying securities of those companies. If you evaluate coins by examining their team and their products using a \"venture capital-like approach,\" that is because they are companies and they are issuing securities.  Also I have a feeling we should check in on this guy in six months:  \u201cThe less regulation, the better,\u201d said Zachary Ising, a 24-year-old graduate student at California University of Pennsylvania who relies on virtual currency trading for all his income and has a majority of his assets in a Binance account. \u201cI\u2019m confident in Binance\u2019s ability to secure its own platform.\u201d  Elsewhere: \"Russia says Venezuela has not offered to repay debts in cryptocurrency.\" And: \"Reddit Disables Bitcoin Payments.\" Honestly I didn't know that you could pay for Reddit, but if I had known that you could pay for Reddit, I'd have been pretty confident that you could pay for Reddit with Bitcoin. Now you can't.  Blockchain blockchain blockchain.  Here is \"Blockchain Technology for Corporate Governance and Shareholder Activism\" by Anne Lafarre and Christoph Van der Elst. \"Shares are usually held through complex chains of intermediaries,\" they write, and \"these intermediaries not only add transaction costs to shareholder participation per se, there is also high uncertainty that information, including the record of shareholder votes, is correctly channelled between ultimate shareholders and companies in remote participation.\" The solution is of course the blockchain:  In a private blockchain, managed by the company only accessible for shareholders for example on the Hyperledger of IBM, the company and shareholders that hold sufficient shares can place proposals. Smart contracting allows for the private ledger to be structured so that all relevant information including majority rules and access rights that are contained in the articles of association and the law are taken into account. Once a certain proposal is placed in the blockchain, shareholders that hold shares in the company are immediately notified and can exercise their voting rights during a short period. The voting results may become instantly available after a cut-off point, and majority requirements, necessary to render the decision binding and verifiable, need to be reached in a specified timeframe. Shareholders can verify their own transactions, but none of the shareholders should be able to determine what voting decision was taken by other shareholders.  Look, you know, fine. We have talked about exactly these problems -- the complex chain of intermediation in stock voting that leads to uncertainty and reduced participation -- and in fact I have even gone so far as to mutter the word \"blockchain\" in those discussions. But what if you replaced the word \"blockchain\" in the paragraph above with a word like, say, \"website\"? What if the company had a private website where it could put proposals, and a database where it tracked share ownership, and the shareholders could log in to the website and see and vote on proposals? The call here is for a private blockchain -- one administered by the company -- so the trustlessness and decentralization benefits of public blockchains are not relevant. This is just an argument that companies should have better databases for tracking their shareholders, and better user interfaces to allow those shareholders to vote their shares. The blockchain has nothing to do with it, except that people want to read about the blockchain.  Elsewhere, some of the people who piloted blockchain projects realized they were pointless:  DTCC, known as Wall Street\u2019s bookkeeper, recently put the brakes on a blockchain system for the clearing and settlement of repurchase, or repo, agreement transactions, said Murray Pozmanter, head of clearing agency services at the DTCC. The project, which had successfully tested with startup Digital Asset Holdings (DA), was shelved because banks and other potential users believed the same results could be achieved more cheaply using current technology, he said. \u201cBasically, it became a solution in search of a problem,\u201d he said.  Yes! The blockchain project worked! But also so would a database run by a trusted central counterparty such as, just to throw one name out there, DTCC. You could just about imagine someone, somewhere, saying \"the blockchain is a solution to the problem that we rely too much on DTCC to clear and settle repo trades.\" (I mean, it seems like a niche thing to worry about, but you could.) It is harder to imagine DTCC concluding that. And if DTCC is going to run a centralized blockchain, why not just run a centralized database instead?  Virtual reality.  Are we currently living in a computer simulation run for the entertainment or edification of some far more intelligent beings? Sure, why not. I have to say that the best evidence for it is that when people come up with virtual-reality projects, the reality always seems to be so grimly literal. Microsoft Corp., for instance, developed \"a digital room where we could sit at a digital desk and interact with Microsoft programs such as Word,\" which sounds a whole lot like the actual rooms at my house and my office where I sit at an actual desk and interact with Word. And if a virtual-reality desk job isn't quite existentially terrifying enough for you, now you can virtually die at your virtual-reality desk:  Visitors could don VR glasses and earphones to experience having a seizure at work, a failed paramedic rescue, and entrance into the afterlife. Funeral parlor employee Dong Ziyi told The Beijing News that the immersive experience \u201cenables people to better cherish the beauty of life.\u201d  Now we just need a virtual-reality experience of eating lunch at your desk. We really are building all the components of virtual-reality life, and death, under late capitalism. I would na\u00efvely have thought that people would build virtual reality experiences that are, you know, fun, that you can't really get in your daily life. As opposed to, like, \"do some word processing and then die at your desk.\" But I guess the fact that our simulated reality is so much like our boring reality is an argument that our boring reality is itself a simulation.

The Tesla\u2019s driver said he had the vehicle\u2019s Autopilot driver-assist system engaged when it struck a firetruck at around 65 miles per hour, a union for Culver City, California firefighters said in a tweet on Monday. \"Amazingly there were no injuries! Please stay alert while driving!\" the union said in the tweet.  The firetruck was parked in an emergency lane at the side of the highway attending to another accident at the time of the morning collision, according to the Mercury News.  Tesla said in a statement that Autopilot is \u201cintended for use only with a fully attentive driver.\u201d The company said it has taken steps to educate drivers about the need to keep their hands on the steering wheel and be prepared to take over from Autopilot, which it calls an \"advanced driver assistance system\" that is not intended to turn the vehicle into an autonomous car.  The NTSB has previously said Tesla\u2019s Autopilot system was a contributing factor in a 2016 fatal crash in Florida. In that incident, a Model S driver died after the car drove underneath a semi-trailer crossing a divided road that the Autopilot\u2019s sensors failed to detect.  The NTSB criticized Tesla and other carmakers for measuring whether a driver is paying attention using steering wheel movement in a September report about the fatal 2016 Tesla crash involving Autopilot.  General Motors Co. last year began equipping some Cadillac cars with its Super Cruise system that allows for going hands-free on the highway. The system monitors whether a driver is paying attention using a small camera on the top of the steering wheel column to track head position.  \u2014 With assistance by Dana Hull", "stock": "TSLA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-01-23", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-23/tesla-crash-in-california-draws-interest-from-u-s-investigators"}, {"article": "The Way Humans Get Electricity Is About to Change Forever  Elon Musk is no longer leading the charge in residential solar.  Tesla Inc. installed 87 megawatts of commercial and residential solar in the fourth quarter, including about 50 megawatts at homes, according to a GTM Research estimate. Rival Sunrun Inc. added 85 megawatts of residential systems in the same period, according to a statement Tuesday. Counting only that part of Tesla\u2019s operation, Sunrun took the lead in the third quarter.  The changing of the guard comes more than a year after Tesla bought Musk\u2019s debt-burdened SolarCity for $2 billion. Tesla has since prioritized profitability in solar over growth-at-all-costs as the company seeks to transform itself into a solar and battery giant to complement its electric vehicles. Tesla has ceded solar market-share in most quarters since that deal, and without SolarCity trumpeting solar, the U.S. residential market contracted in 2017 after at least 16 consecutive years of growth.  \u201cSolarCity was the marketing and lobbying machine for the entire industry, and everyone is struggling in its absence,\u201d said Hugh Bromley, a New York-based analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance.

Without that marketing muscle, smaller installers also saw declines in that period, and total U.S. residential installations may shrink again this year.  \u201cWe like having Tesla in the market,\u201d Lynn Jurich, Sunrun\u2019s chief executive officer, said in an interview Tuesday. \u201cTesla is a really well-known brand,\u201d she added, pointing to the company\u2019s product innovations.  Sunrun, meanwhile, has reported steady gains in the face of the market-wide slowdown. It has focused on improving margins instead of rapid growth, and installed 90 megawatts in the third quarter, up 12 percent from a year earlier. \u201cThat foundation is what we believe sets us up for the long term,\u201d Jurich said.

The unprecedented pay package has been criticized as too costly by proxy adviser Glass Lewis & Co., which has recommended that investors reject the plan.

Each tranche equals about 1 percent of Tesla\u2019s outstanding shares. The company\u2019s market value has to reach $650 billion for the award to fully vest -- roughly a 12-fold increase.  Musk Dependence  Musk\u2019s star power has helped vault Tesla to an almost $55 billion market capitalization, exceeding the value of General Motors Co. or Ford Motor Co. While the company has struggled to mass-manufacture cars including the new Model 3 sedan, he\u2019s convinced investors to buy into his vision of consumers converting to electric vehicles in droves.  Tesla lists its dependence on Musk as a risk factor in securities filings, and some analysts and short sellers have raised concern that the carmaker could run into trouble because of the amount of attention he devotes to other ventures including rocket company Space Exploration Technologies Corp.  \u201cI expect to remain CEO for the foreseeable future,\u201d Musk said during Tesla\u2019s earnings call in February. \u201cThere are no plans to make a change at this time.\u201d  Tesla without Elon wouldn\u2019t be the same company, said Joel Grant, an automotive and industrial analyst at T.

The unprecedented pay package proposes Musk won\u2019t get paid unless his company\u2019s stock rises, further tying the 46-year-old chief executive officer\u2019s personal wealth to that of shareholders. It envisions a staggering increase in market value to $650 billion that would put Tesla in the league of tech giants like Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp., now more than 10 times its size. Revenue would expand to $175 billion, ahead of General Motors Co.  The move assures investors that Musk will lead Tesla through its next phase of rapid growth despite his many other commitments and interests. He is also the CEO of Space Exploration Technologies Corp. and has embarked on several other ventures including OpenAI, Neuralink and the Boring Co.  Under the plan, which requires shareholder approval in March, Musk\u2019s pay is tied strictly to stock performance and profit. He will receive no salary or bonus. A 10-year grant of stock options vests in 12 tranches that are linked to market capitalization in $50 billion increments, starting at $100 billion. There are also milestones tied to revenue and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, Tesla said in a statement.  Musk Payday 10-year pay plan means CEO could bag $56 billion -- theoretically Source: Tesla  Musk, who is already Tesla\u2019s biggest shareholder, has a net worth estimated at $21.5 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The new pay plan would add as much as $55.8 billion to that total. The company said that figure was theoretical, given the likelihood of additional employee stock awards, as well as the possibility of mergers or raising new capital.  \u201cWhile Tesla has no way of predicting how much dilution there will be, some amount of future dilution is a certainty,\u201d the company said in a filing.  The agreement requires Musk to remain as Tesla\u2019s CEO or serve as executive chairman and chief product officer -- potentially paving the way for the company to eventually hire another CEO. The plan is aimed at ensuring that Musk \u201cwill continue to lead Tesla\u2019s management over the long-term while also providing the flexibility to bring in another CEO who would report to Elon at some point in the future,\u201d the company said.  Tesla, based in Palo Alto, California, has more than 33,000 employees worldwide and recently launched the Model 3 sedan, a more affordable electric car that is the linchpin to the company\u2019s efforts to reach the mass market and profitability. Tesla, which has struggled to ramp up production of the car, no longer includes vehicle output targets in Musk\u2019s proposed compensation plan.  The company, whose stated mission \u201c is to accelerate the world\u2019s transition to sustainable energy,\u201d also sells its batteries to utilities seeking to integrate renewable forms of energy like solar and wind onto the grid. That product line is expanding to include a solar roof product for homeowners. Musk\u2019s personal brand as a futurist is deeply intertwined with the identity of the company, which has legions of fans and devoted customers but has yet to make an annual profit.  Musk\u2019s previous compensation plan was also tied to stock performance and vehicle development targets set in 2012. The carmaker was valued at $59.1 billion at the close of trading Monday. The shares have jumped 13 percent since the start of the year.

The problem is that a key to its future battery manufacturing is still in Germany.  The electric-car maker -- which still plans to make about 2,500 of the cars a week by the end of March -- designed a new automated system for module production at its battery factory near Reno, Nevada. The line is already working at Tesla\u2019s German manufacturing unit Grohmann but needs to be shipped to the U.S. next month to be put to use, Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said.  \u201cThat\u2019s got to be disassembled, brought over to the Gigafactory, and re-assembled and then brought into operation at the Gigafactory. It\u2019s not a question of whether it works or not. It\u2019s just a question of disassembly, transport and reassembly,\u201d he said on a conference call Wednesday. Once that milestone is completed, Tesla will next need to fix material-handling constraints at its Fremont, California, assembly plant before it can reach its goal to make 5,000 Model 3 sedans a week by the end of June.  Tesla has pushed back targets several times for Model 3, the more affordable car it\u2019s banking on to propel it from niche electric-car maker to more of a mass manufacturer. The slower production ramp has meant less money is coming in the door from customers taking delivery, and Wall Street is watching closely for any signs the targets could slip again.  Tesla shares fell 8.6 percent to $315.23 on Thursday in New York, the biggest one-day drop since June 2016.  Positive News  Other aspects of Tesla\u2019s latest quarterly loss were more positive. The company\u2019s cash balance barely budged in the last three months of the year even as it struggled to make Model 3 sedans.  Paying customers are supporting Tesla through its production struggle -- they\u2019ve put down more than $850 million in deposits for vehicles including the Semi truck and Roadster sports car Musk showed off in November.  \u201cThe business is complex, and there\u2019s almost always something for bears to focus on. But in Q4, we think most of the news was positive,\u201d Piper Jaffray analyst Alexander Potter wrote in a report.  While it\u2019s going to take time to get Model 3 production to targeted levels, the chief executive officer of both Tesla and Space Exploration Technologies Corp. has succeeded in captivating consumers in the meantime. Musk\u2019s latest promotional stunt involved firing off a sports car into the sky atop the world\u2019s most powerful rocket.  \u201cIf we can send a Roadster to the asteroid belt, we can probably solve Model 3 production,\u201d Musk said on the conference call with analysts, shortly after tweeting another photo of his Roadster hurtling through space.  Unconventional Fundraising Tesla's customer deposits jumped in fourth quarter amid Semi truck, Roadster reveals Source: Company statements  Tesla has said it\u2019s putting off spending to double its production rate to 10,000 Model 3s until it reaches the 5,000 unit milestone. It also deferred some Model 3-related capital expenditures in the fourth quarter, which \u201cdressed up the cash flow,\u201d Cowen\u2019s Osborne said.  A closely watched figure indicating how much money Tesla is using up -- negative free cash flow -- was just $277 million in the fourth quarter, the lowest in more than a year.  Easing Concerns  \u201cAll the cash concerns will be alleviated once they get these cars on the road,\u201d said Tasha Keeney, an analyst at ARK Investment Management, which holds Tesla stock.  Tesla is still far from being in the clear with regards to cash. The company finished the fourth quarter with about $3.4 billion, and it\u2019s planning slightly more than $3.4 billion in capital expenditures this year after spending that much in 2017.  Some of the expenditures planned for this year are linked to what\u2019s coming next to Tesla\u2019s lineup. In addition to the Semi going into production in 2019 and the Roadster coming in 2020, Tesla plans to add a crossover called the Model Y.  Tesla will announce the location for where it\u2019ll build that in three to six months, with capital spending toward the vehicle starting later this year.  The company expects to deliver about 100,000 Model S sedans and Model X sport utility vehicles, in line with last year\u2019s 101,312.  The department tasked with pulling that off will now be reporting directly to the CEO after Lyft Inc. hired away Jon McNeill, who had been president of global sales and service at Tesla and an influential figure at the company.

Elon Musk, in a testy Twitter exchange, said he is \u201cback to sleeping at the factory\u201d while trying to fix production delays with the Model 3 electric car. It\u2019s a move reminiscent of Tesla\u2019s last vehicle launch\u2014the Model X\u2014when Musk famously kept a sleeping bag near the production line so he could immediately address any hiccups.  \u201cCar biz is hell,\u201d Musk said.  The posts on Twitter came as investors await Tesla\u2019s first-quarter production numbers, which are expected to fall short of company forecasts. The exchange, with a reporter at the Information, a tech and business news site, followed a story by the outlet that Musk had taken over Model 3 production from Tesla\u2019s head of engineering, Doug Field.  For the past year, Field has managed engineering of both the vehicle and its production. Musk said Field had originally been tasked with both jobs to ensure Tesla doesn\u2019t design cars that are \u201ccrazy hard to build,\u201d but now that the company was back in the thick of production, \u201cit\u2019s better to divide and conquer.\u201d  Tesla Inc. is under enormous pressure to build the Model 3 fast enough to meet customer demand\u2014and to bring in revenue to offset billions of dollars spent preparing for its rollout. An experimental tracking model developed by Bloomberg estimates that Tesla was able to produce 9,285 Model 3s for the quarter and achieved a final burst of production of as many as 2,200 cars a week. Musk had vowed to reach 2,500 a week by the end of the first quarter\u2014a target that was already scaled back from a prior forecast of 5,000 a week by the end of 2017.  See more about the Bloomberg Model 3 Tracker here.  Tesla has built up a die-hard fan base, with some half a million people putting down $1,000 reservations for the Model 3 since it was unveiled two years ago. But the company is still trying to prove it has what it takes to be a true mass-production company. Tesla reports production and delivery results within a few days of each quarter ending.  When Tesla rolled out the Model X in late 2015, it was years behind schedule, and production was marred by problems with its complicated falcon wing doors, custom mono-post rear seats and other unique new high-tech features. Musk told investors in 2016 that he kept a sleeping bag on hand and moved his desk to wherever the factory problems were most troublesome.  It\u2019s not clear where Tesla\u2019s current bottlenecks reside. During a first-quarter earnings call, Musk said the primary holdup was with robots at the company\u2019s battery Gigafactory near Reno, Nevada. A new production line had been built for it at Tesla\u2019s Grohmann Automation labs in Germany and was scheduled to be installed at the Gigafactory last month. If Musk is instead camping out at the automaker\u2019s Fremont, California, car factory, that would suggest his attention has shifted away from the batteries to car assembly. Tesla wants to double production in the next three months, to 5,000 cars a week. Fremont is where that will, or won\u2019t, happen.  Even if Tesla reaches its first-quarter production target, it\u2019s not clear whether the company will be able to sustain and build off of it. According to Musk\u2019s latest posts on Twitter, the company hasn\u2019t emerged from production hell just yet.

Investors on Wednesday approved what may be the largest compensation deal in history for its chief executive officer, pegged on ambitions to turn Tesla into one of the world\u2019s largest companies as it ventures beyond solar panels and electric cars. If successful, the award could end up being worth more than $50 billion -- a sum so large it might just ensure that Musk\u2019s array of other passions and esoteric side projects won\u2019t steal too much time from his work at Tesla.  \u201cI expect to remain CEO for the foreseeable future,\u201d Musk said during last month\u2019s earnings call with analysts.

Profit Ahead?  Tesla shares traded higher following news of the vote. The stock closed up 1.9 percent in New York. A spokesman for the company declined to comment.  The pay plan helps ensure Musk will remain at Tesla at least until 2028, but several questions loom. The award contains a number of audacious goals and no detailed plan of how to get there, including when the manufacturer will turn its first-ever annual profit. Additionally, a series of executive exits in the past year has left Tesla without a clear No. 2 -- a potential concern even if Musk stays front and center.  This quarter alone, Tesla has lost Jon McNeill, president of sales and service; its accounting chief Eric Branderiz; and Susan Repo, corporate treasurer and vice president of finance. Going back a full year, Tesla has also lost executives including Chief Financial Officer Jason Wheeler; Chris Lattner, an Apple Inc. hire who left after leading Tesla\u2019s Autopilot engineering team for less than six months; Kurt Kelty, a senior battery executive; and Diarmuid O\u2019Connell, vice president of business development.  Jamie Albertine, analyst at Consumer Edge Research, said he sees Tesla needing to hire a chief operating officer or a new head of service \u201cat some point in the near future.\u201d Musk said on the earnings call last month that McNeill\u2019s department would report directly to him and that \u201cthere are no plans to search for a replacement,\u201d even as some investors fear he\u2019s spreading himself too thin. In 2016, Musk said he was working so hard, he kept a sleeping bag in a conference room adjacent to Tesla\u2019s production line in Fremont.  Billionaire Bait  The award, which won\u2019t vest unless a set of ambitious financial goals are met, had been cheered by some large Tesla investors who said it would help the CEO drive the business forward. Critics, including the two largest proxy advisers, said it was too costly and questioned why Musk, a billionaire who has about half his wealth tied up in company stock, needed more equity to stay motivated.  The board needed majority approval to make the grant, which likely is the largest one-time compensation deal ever awarded. Tesla had said Musk and his brother, who\u2019s a company director, wouldn\u2019t vote their shares.  Tesla Targets Musk's award will pay when Tesla hits pairs of goals, with one tied to market value Source: Proxy filing  Under the new plan, Musk will earn one-12th of the options every time Tesla hits a pair of goals: one tied to its market value and the other linked to either revenue or earnings excluding certain charges. For Musk to get all the options, Tesla would have to become worth $650 billion -- more than Facebook Inc. -- and produce more revenue than Procter & Gamble Co.  Tesla has said in regulatory filings that Musk\u2019s award could yield him more than $50 billion if all goals are achieved. Some investors have said the package aligns with their interests, signaling they don\u2019t mind if Musk gets wealthier, as long as they also see big returns.

Tesla's semi-autonomous driver assist system that handles some tasks and allows drivers under certain conditions to take their hands off the wheel.  The system requires drivers to keep their hands on the steering wheel, and emits escalating alerts if they don't.  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said on Tuesday it was sending two investigators to examine the crash of a Tesla vehicle apparently traveling in semi-autonomous mode and a fire truck in California.  In a post on Twitter, the federal safety agency said the \"field investigation\" would examine both driver and vehicle factors in Monday's accident.  This is the second time the safety board has probed a Tesla crash that may be linked to Autopilot, Tesla's semi-autonomous driver assist system that handles some tasks and allows drivers under certain conditions to take their hands off the wheel for extended periods.  The Culver City, California fire department said in a Twitter post that on Monday an engine was struck by a Tesla \"traveling at 65 mph. The driver reports the vehicle was on Autopilot. Amazingly there were no injuries.\"  The NTSB faulted Tesla in a prior fatal Autopilot crash.  In September, the NTSB chairman said \"operational limitations\" in the Tesla Model S played a \"major role\" in a May 2016 crash that killed a driver using the vehicle's semi-autonomous system.  The limits on the system include factors such as Tesla being unable to ensure driver attention even when the car is traveling at high speeds, ensuring Autopilot is used only on certain roads and monitoring driver engagement, NTSB said in September.  The NTSB recommended auto safety regulators and automakers take steps to ensure that semi-autonomous systems are not misused.  \"System safeguards were lacking,\" NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said.  Tesla declined to comment Tuesday on the new probe. In September the company said, \"Autopilot significantly increases safety,\" citing an earlier government study that suggested the system reduced the incidence of crashes.  The company has emphasized that \"Autopilot is not a fully self-driving technology and drivers need to remain attentive at all times.\"  Joshua Brown, a 40-year-old Ohio man, was killed near Williston, Florida, when his Model S collided with a truck while it was engaged in the Autopilot mode.  The fatal incident raised questions about the safety of systems that can perform driving tasks for extended stretches of time with little or no human intervention, but which cannot completely replace human drivers.  The NTSB said Tesla could have taken further steps to prevent the system's misuse, and faulted the driver for not paying attention. The agency said the Autopilot system operated as designed but did not ensure drivers paid adequate attention.

Earth is the bright crescent seen in the background. Elon Musk/SpaceX via Instagram  SpaceX, founded by Elon Musk, recently launched the world's largest operational rocket on February 6.  Falcon Heavy's launch sent Musk's personal 2008 red Tesla Roadster on a voyage toward Mars orbit with a \"Starman\" dummy in the driver's seat.  Planetary scientists are concerned about bacterial contamination on Musk's car in case it crashes into Mars \u2014 a planet that may host alien microbes.  However, new calculations show the Tesla will most likely hit Earth, Venus, or the sun.  On February 6, SpaceX launched the world's most powerful operational rocket, called Falcon Heavy, for the first time.  The launch sent company founder Elon Musk's own red Tesla Roadster on a path that crosses the orbit of Mars. This attracted the attention of researchers worried about an eventual crash into the red planet, which would contaminate the world \u2014 and any alien microbes living there.  But planetary science researchers can now breathe a little easier, if a new study about the Roadster's fate is correct.  Musk put his Roadster on top of the 230-foot-tall rocket with a spacesuit-clad dummy named \"Starman\" in the driver's seat. Launching the car demonstrated Falcon Heavy's capabilities and was reportedly a backup plan for a scientific NASA or military payload.  The Roadster's short-lived yet unparalleled camera feeds, overall silliness (as Musk has described it), and far-flung path through space captured global attention.  But not all of it has proved welcome.  SpaceX founder Elon Musk in a press conference after the launch of Falcon Heavy. Dave Mosher/Business Insider The Planetary Society's Jason Davis bemoaned the planetary protection risk posed by Musk's un-sterilized car crashing into Mars and sprinkling debris coated with bacteria, viruses, and fungi all over the planet. The reason: alien microbes may be hiding out in Martian soil.  \"NASA goes to great lengths sterilizing spacecraft designed to land on Mars, in order to make sure there's no chance of Earthly microbes contaminating the surface,\" Davis wrote in a post before launch. \"Such a contamination could harm existing life and muddle scientific efforts to search for said life.\"  But that risk now appears minimal, according to a new scientific study titled \"The random walk of cars and their collision probabilities with planets.\"  Three researchers at the University of Toronto posted their paper on Tuesday to the pre-print arXiv server and submitted to the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.  Where and when Musk's Tesla will most likely crash  A chart showing the location of Elon Musk's Tesla Roadster in space on February 15, 2018. WhereIsTesla.com  Hanno Rein, an astrophysicist and lead author of the study, said the roughly week-long research came out of advanced orbital-mechanics computer simulations.  \"Earth is the most likely place the car will crash, followed by Venus, and then the sun,\" Rein told Business Insider, and likely within 10 million years \u2014 not hundreds of millions or possibly billions, as Musk has suggested.  To arrive at that conclusion, Rein and his colleagues started with orbital tracking data for the Roadster posted by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Then they plugged that data into simulation software called REBOUND, which allowed them to fast-forward the car's likeliest orbital paths through the solar system over the next few million years.  That data suggest Musk's car will fly out past Mars orbit, spending very little time there, and then swing back around, over and over again.  \"Every 30 years or so, it will come relatively close to the Earth,\" Rein said, where it will get a gravitational tug. \"This causes a change of a few percent in some of the orbital parameters. The distance to the sun would change slightly, for example, and the orbit's eccentricity.\"  The calculations suggest the Roadster will come within one Earth-moon distance of our planet within 100 years, possibly enabling new Earth-based telescope views.  Elon Musk's red Tesla Roadster before launching on a Falcon Heavy rocket toward Mars orbit. Elon Musk/SpaceX; Instagram  But after its third flyby, Rein said the Roadster will take on an increasingly chaotic and somewhat unpredictable path through space. That's because those gravitational tugs near Earth's orbit \u2014 where the car will spend most of its time compared to other bodies in the system \u2014 can \"lead to a huge change afterward,\" Rein said.  By running hundreds of different simulations of those orbital possibilities out to 3.5 million years from today, Rein and his colleagues figured out there's a 6% chance of the Roadster crashing into Earth and a 2.5% chance of crashing into Venus during that time.  \"We've not seen any single collision with Mars in 240 simulations, though we continue to run them and see what happens,\" Rein said. \"The likely outcome is that it will crash, in tens of millions of years, into Earth or Venus or the sun.\"  Astronomers are tracking the car in space  Two other astronomers \u2014 Gianluca Masi of The Virtual Telescope Project and Michael Schwartz of Tenagra Observatories, Ltd. \u2014 also used JPL data to track the Roadster.  Last week, they managed to photograph the car flying beyond the moon moving at a speed of roughly 25,000 miles per hour.  The vehicle is reflective enough to see through a telescope, at least for now, leading to what they called a \"stunning\" animation of several images.  Masi said he and Schwartz will continue to track the Roadster for as long as possible.  \"The object is slowly fading: you can image it now with a 6\" or so scope,\" Masi told Business Insider in an email. \"In one month or so it will need a much larger scope to be imaged (16\" or larger).\"", "stock": "TSLA", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-15", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://uk.businessinsider.com/starman-elon-musk-car-orbit-collision-risk-calculations-2018-2"}, {"article": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images  The idea that Apple should buy Tesla has been floated many times.  Apple now has more than enough cash coming back to the US to do the deal.  Tesla needs to be saved from its delusional idea about the company's future growth \u2014 and Apple needs to be saved from the disaster of its car project.  Last November, Rolling Stone published a profile of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, written by Neil Strauss, a neo-gonzo journalist who made his name with a book about pickup culture. And in that interview Musk made a confession.  \"I wish we could be private with Tesla,\" Musk told Strauss. \"It actually makes us less efficient to be a public company.\"  Tesla has been public since its 2010 IPO and since then the stock has risen from about $20 a share to nearly $400 at one point in 2017. The company's market cap is now close to $60 billion. Investors who jumped in seven years ago have enjoyed a return of nearly 1,200%.  Musk might be the only person who wishes Tesla were private. Even short-sellers, recently clobbered by Tesla's surge, have been delighted when the stock has gone through one of its periodic swoons of $100 in a few months. And ironically, Musk's next ten years of compensation are now completely tied to Tesla's market performance, which the board of directors thinks can yield a $650-billion market cap.  That's delusional. In many ways, it sets Musk up for both continued inefficiency \u2014 a lot of second-guessing about investments in automation, for example, at the expense of hitting production targets \u2014 and potentially epic failure. It also represents a radical formulation of shareholder value theory.  Tesla is wildly overvalued, and what it needs now isn't a fatter stock price but rather an ability to satisfy customers. For the Model 3 mass-market vehicle, currently stalled amid production bottlenecks, Tesla has 400,000 mostly unfulfilled pre-orders.  Apple buying Tesla is an idea that always seems to be on the table  Apple CEO Tim Cook. Getty  In the past, there's been talk about somebody buying Tesla. Usually, Apple is the one that gets everybody's heart racing. I've shot down this idea several times. But with the announcement of Musk's new pay package, I think Tesla needs to be rescued from itself. And that Musk should get his wish.  Tesla is worth so much that there aren't very many companies able to buy the automaker. And Tesla going truly private would be too much of a reversal of history as well as a financial improbability, although if the bottom falls out some investors might someday snap up what's left of Tesla on the cheap.  Apple, thanks to the new tax bill, will repatriate over $250 billion is cash that it has been keeping overseas. Even after paying taxes on it, at the reduced corporate rate, it will have arguably too much left over. It could easily wind up going into share buybacks or a dividend, or Apple could continue its pattern of making small acquisitions.  Or the company, which is sitting on a mature iPhone business that mints the profits but could be looking at more severe growth headwinds in coming years, could swing for the fences and get a piece of the multi-trillion global transportation industry. If Tim Cook agrees with the Tesla board that the company will be worth $650 billion in a decade, then buying Tesla now would be a staggering bargain.  The obvious question is, \"Who would be Tesla's CEO?\" Musk's pay package is designed to ensure that it's him, an extreme evolution of addressing the \"great man\" risk that companies led by visionary founders face. But Musk is also running SpaceX and he's on the verge of launching a huge rocket that could pave the way for a Mars mission. Dealing with Tesla's difficulties could be seen as a needless distraction.  That said, Musk could remain CEO of Tesla as an independent business unit of Apple, while Tim Cook would run the entire show (Musk could also relinquish the CEO title but continue as chairman of the board). In a way, Cook isn't really a CEO in the Musk/Steve Jobs vein anyway. He's more like a mega-COO.  And that's just what Tesla actually needs right now. If it was Jobs who rescued Apple and put it on the path that led to the iPod and the iPhone, it was Cook who turned the company into the profit-making colossus it has become. The guy is a supply-chain genius. Making stuff is his bag. And at the moment, Tesla is struggling mightily to make stuff, falling well behind its ambitious production targets for the Model 3 mass-market vehicle.  Tesla would also witness its cash-burn challenges \u2014 over $1 billion per quarter \u2014 vanish. Apple could fund losses for years.  Tesla could help Apple get into the car business The Apple Car project isn't going well. Apple  Apple has a history of falling into innovations troughs. It's in one now, following the monumental success of the iPhone. The Apple Watch hasn't been a gamechanger, and the company is chasing Amazon on smart speakers. Apple clearly wants to do something in the transportation space, but thus far its efforts have been at best confused and at worst pathetic.  Buying Tesla would change that overnight. The Apple Car, really, is a Tesla car anyway. The whole philosophy behind Tesla's vehicles, and especially the ultra-minimalist Model 3, is Apple-esque. The wait for the Apple Car would be immediately over.  And that would enable Apple to focus on bringing to Tesla what Apple's engineers and designers are now probably working on: an entirely new vehicle interface \u2014 an operating system for the car of the future.  Tesla has aspects of such a system in place, from over-the-air software updates to an increasing focus on single screens for all vehicle operations. Apple would enhance and unify these components and transform them into something unexpected. This is Apple's mojo: take something that works and make it much, much better.  Missing out on a mega-return \u2014 but one that isn't likely  Tesla market cap has become epic. Andy Kiersz/Business Insider  For investors, of course, Apple buying Tesla would eliminate any chance of a mega-return. But I think the odds are low that the 1,000%-plus payback of the past seven years will be matched by another 1,000% surge over the next ten years (Tesla is, after all, 14 years old \u2014 hardly a startup). If Tesla stays public, stockholders will also have to put up with numerous, diluting capital raises and the ever-present threat that Tesla's lack of cash and debt burden will lead to a bankruptcy.  If Apple bought Tesla, the carmaker's growth would be piped into Apple shares, and Tesla investors would certainly get a premium for their holdings, as Apple can afford to overpay. I don't even think that government regulators would have issues with the merger. Sure, Apple would be buying the dominant electric-car manufacturer. But as of 2018, the EV market makes up only 1% of global sales.  I would have stuck to my guns on the foolishness of an Apple acquisition of Tesla were it not for the reckless pay package that Tesla concocted for Musk. But I now think that Tesla is fueling a dangerous idea about the company's capabilities. Somebody needs to save Tesla from its hubris.

Musk's new compensation plan scraps any promise to hit vehicle production goals, which Tesla has always fallen short of.  An analyst predicted that Tesla could build 100,000 new Model S cars in 2018, versus 400,000 preorders.  LONDON \u2014 Tesla on Tuesday announced a new compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk, and he will not get paid a single dollar unless his company's shareholders do extremely well.  Perhaps unfortunately for the 400,000 or so people who have preordered a Tesla electric vehicle, Musk's compensation won't be tied to his company's ability to build cars.  Tesla has a history of struggling with production and has missed key targets. For example, after Musk said Tesla aimed to produce 20,000 Model 3 vehicles a month by this past December, the company delivered only 1,550 in the entire fourth quarter. Musk has also said he wants to build 500,000 vehicles this year, but that now seems unlikely given the now delayed production of the Model 3.  An analyst note from December projected just 100,000 Model S Teslas coming off the line in 2018.  Tesla's stock has continued to outpace its competitors', soaring by over 1,000% since the carmaker went public in 2010.  Rather than focus on building cars, as GM and Ford do, Musk's new compensation schedule is \"entirely contingent on achieving market cap and operational milestones that would make Tesla one of the most valuable companies in the world,\" according to a press release.  For Musk's compensation to fully vest, \"Tesla's market cap would have to grow to $650 billion (an increase of almost $600 billion), and important revenue and profitability goals would also have to be achieved,\" the company said.  \"Elon will receive no guaranteed compensation of any kind \u2014 no salary, no cash bonuses, and no equity that vests simply by the passage of time,\" the release continued.  Is Tesla a car company?  Tesla  Musk's previous compensation plan included vehicle-production targets alongside milestones in increasing market capitalization, but that clause has been dropped from the new plan.  Tesla did mention plans to build \"the company's vehicle product line to cover all major forms of terrestrial transport,\" as well as \"expanding solar energy generation through Solar Roof and other solar products and seamlessly integrating them with battery storage,\" but made no direct mention of increasing car production or reliability.  In Tesla's release, it refers to itself as \"the world's first vertically-integrated sustainable energy company,\" but in the electric-car business, Tesla finds itself increasingly facing rivals offering similar or in some ways better vehicles.", "stock": "TSLA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-01-22", "source": "business-insider", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musks-pay-tesla-2018-1"}, {"article": "Volkswagen plans to release its I.D. crossover SUV in 2020.

In a blog post tonight, Tesla said it\u2019s not yet clear what happened in the time leading up to the accident. Tesla also said it does not yet know what caused it.  Tesla did note that, according to its data, Tesla owners have driven that same stretch of Highway 101 with Autopilot engaged about 85,000 times since Tesla first rolled out the automated control system in 2015. Since the beginning of this year, Tesla drivers have successfully handled that stretch of the highway 20,000 times, according to Tesla.  \u201cThe reason this crash was so severe is that the crash attenuator, a highway safety barrier which is designed to reduce the impact into a concrete lane divider, had either been removed or crushed in a prior accident without being replaced,\u201d the company wrote.  Below, you can see what the barrier was supposed to look like versus what it looked like the day before the accident.  Tesla says it obtained the image of the more recent photo from the dash cam of a witness who regularly makes the commute. The company went on to say it has \u201cnever seen this level of damage to a Model X in any other crash.\u201d  As previously reported, the accident also caused a fire. In the event there is a fire, Tesla says its battery packs are designed so that people have enough time to get out of the car.  \u201cAccording to witnesses, that appears to be what happened here as we understand there were no occupants still in the Model X by the time the fire could have presented a risk,\u201d Tesla wrote. \u201cSerious crashes like this can result in fire regardless of the type of car, and Tesla\u2019s billions of miles of actual driving data shows that a gas car in the United States is five times more likely to experience a fire than a Tesla vehicle.\u201d  The promise of Tesla\u2019s Autopilot system is to reduce car accidents. In the company\u2019s blog post, Tesla notes Autopilot reduces crash rates by 40 percent, according to an independent review by the U.S. government.

The board unveiled a pay deal for Elon Musk, the chief executive, on Tuesday that will make him nearly $60 billion if he hits new targets by 2028. That\u2019s on top of the $100 billion gain the electric-car pioneer would make on his existing stake.  Mr. Musk\u2019s new targets are even more ambitious than the 10-year goals from 2012 that he blew through years early. The potential value of share grants totaling 12 percent of the company is vast, but at least the Tesla board has done much more than the usual lip service in setting a serious challenge.  It involves Mr. Musk hitting two sets of metrics. First, Tesla\u2019s market capitalization has to reach $650 billion \u2014 more than 10 times its current level and a valuation that would be fourth among today\u2019s publicly listed companies behind Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft, and just ahead of Amazon.  Second, he must turbocharge Tesla\u2019s financial performance. That requires either growing annual revenue to $175 billion, almost 15 times 2017\u2019s expected top line, or making $14 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a figure that may come in at just over $500 million for last year. There are 12 steps along the route to the maximum payout.  Reaching the revenue target could mean selling well over 2 million of Tesla\u2019s current and planned vehicles, Breakingviews calculates. That level of sales would be in the same ballpark as BMW \u2014 and last year\u2019s total for Tesla was barely over 100,000 vehicles. That doesn\u2019t allow for any surge in the company\u2019s solar-panel and electric-storage business, which at present contributes a single-digit percentage to the top line. Still, to get close would require Tesla to dominate the market for electric cars even as General Motors, Nissan and others ramp up their efforts.  One model for Musk could be Amazon, whose $177 billion of expected 2017 revenue would mark a 12-fold increase from 2007. Founder Jeff Bezos\u2019s stock has surged to 18 times its value a decade ago. Yet at the level that Mr. Musk is now aiming for, financial incentives can lose meaning. With a 20 percent stake already worth $12 billion, hitting his targets may motivate the entrepreneur more powerfully than money.", "stock": "TSLA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-01-23", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/23/business/dealbook/elon-musk-tesla-pay.html"}, {"article": "Tesla has set a dozen targets, each $50 billion more than the next, starting at $100 billion, then $150 billion, then $200 billion and so on, all the way to a market value of $650 billion. In addition, the company has set a dozen revenue and adjusted profit goals. Mr. Musk would receive 1.68 million shares, or about 1 percent of the company, only after he reaches milestones for both.  But to put these numbers in perspective, Tesla is worth only about $59 billion today.  If Mr. Musk were somehow to increase the value of Tesla to $650 billion \u2014 a figure many experts would contend is laughably impossible and would make Tesla one of the five largest companies in the United States, based on current valuations \u2014 his stock award could be worth as much as $55 billion (assuming the company does not issue any more shares over the next decade, which is unrealistic). Even reaching several of the milestones would bring him billions.  Mr. Musk\u2019s critics \u2014 and there are many \u2014 are likely to contend that the new compensation plan is just the company\u2019s latest publicity stunt. He has been called a modern-day P.T. Barnum who has created the illusion of success while consistently missing production estimates. The company continues to lose money; at one point last year, it was losing almost a half-million dollars an hour, according to Bloomberg News. Jim Chanos, a short-seller who has bet against Tesla\u2019s shares \u2014 and has thus far been on the losing side of that trade \u2014 has contended that Tesla is worthless.  But Mr. Musk\u2019s compensation plan is no illusion: He gets paid only if the company succeeds over the long term with significant gains in market cap. And it\u2019s impossible for him to manipulate the system by trying to prop up the stock price for a temporary period. Under the terms of the arrangement, even once his shares vest, he has to hold them an additional five years before he is allowed to sell them.  The way the arrangement is structured, each milestone is a blunt instrument: He either reaches it or gets nothing.  \u201cIf all that happens over the next 10 years is that Tesla\u2019s value grows by 80 or 90 percent, then my amount of compensation would be zero,\u201d he said. (His calculations were based on the stock price at the beginning of this year when the company was worth about $50 billion.)

Many other companies have installed outsize packages that often come at the expense of shareholders because the executives get paid even when they underperform their peers.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Asked how he thinks shareholders should feel about Mr. Musk\u2019s new pay package, Ira Ehrenpreis, chairman of Tesla\u2019s compensation committee, told me, \u201cIt\u2019s heads you win, tails you don\u2019t lose,\u201d meaning if Mr. Musk is gaining billions then shareholders are winning, too. And if Mr. Musk does not perform, shareholders pay nothing.  Mr. Musk\u2019s new compensation plan is similar to the previous one put in place when the company was worth $3.2 billion in 2012. Only now, the numbers are much larger. That package also paid Mr. Musk only when he reached certain market value and operational benchmarks. And virtually nobody could imagine Tesla would be worth 17 times what it was back then.  Mr. Musk has reached all but one of the metrics in that plan.  Even though Mr. Musk\u2019s shares have vested, he has not sold them except to pay the taxes on the grants. His current stake is worth $13 billion.  Mr. Musk does not take a salary, although under California State law, Tesla is required to pay him at least minimum wage. Tesla sends him checks that pay him a little more than $37,000 annually. \u201cI don\u2019t cash it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just ends up accumulating in a Tesla bank account somewhere.\u201d  To afford to live, Mr. Musk has borrowed against his shares, a practice that some corporate executives have questioned. Mr. Musk insists that the loans are such a small portion of his stake in the company that even if Tesla shares were to fall precipitously, it would not impact him or the company.  If Mr. Musk succeeds in hitting some of his benchmarks, it would also mean that the company\u2019s employees, including those who work on the factory floor, who get paid in both cash and stock, could become wealthy.  Under the terms of the deal, which is subject to shareholder approval, Mr. Musk has to remain the company\u2019s chief executive, though the agreement would allow him to become chief product officer and executive chairman with a chief executive reporting to him. He said he saw that as a possibility only if the company became so large that he needed to recruit a top person to oversee the operations.  Mr. Musk has often said he is not driven by money. So what is it about this incentive plan that appeals to him?  \u201cNone of it is intended for dynastic wealth creation,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reason that it\u2019s important to me personally is that there\u2019s some pretty big things that I want to do.\u201d  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  \u201cI want to contribute as much as possible to humanity becoming a multi-planet species,\u201d he said, alluding to a goal he has talked about often, including having people live on Mars. \u201cThat obviously requires a certain amount of capital.\u201d", "stock": "TSLA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-01-23", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/23/business/dealbook/tesla-elon-musk-pay.html"}, {"article": "Still, Amazon cannot quietly hope that such criticism just fades away. Amazon\u2019s rapid growth, immense bargaining power, eye-catching initiatives and estimated 44 percent share of U.S. e-commerce sales make the company vulnerable to accusations that it is too powerful.  But if the Trump administration pursues ways to curtail the company, it would meet sizable obstacles.  Amazon accounts for only 4 percent of all retail sales in the United States, a recent survey estimated. Its revenue is a third of Walmart\u2019s and, even after its acquisition of Whole Foods, Amazon\u2019s footing in the grocery business is still small.  All in all, it would be hard to show that Amazon is pushing prices higher for consumers.  Amazon also has a loyal customer base \u2014 it has an estimated 90 million Prime members \u2014 and the public views it relatively favorably. When the Department of Justice\u2019s antitrust lawyers went after the proposed merger of Time Warner and AT&T, it was not targeting companies that were particularly popular with the public.  Still, some Amazon critics see a possible, though small, opening. In theory, an antitrust case could focus on the firms that supply Amazon with goods, according to Christopher L. Sagers, a law professor at Cleveland State University. If a company consistently uses its power to demand a good from suppliers at too low a price, the public could still get hurt. That\u2019s because the supply of the good could decline, its quality degrade, and there may be less innovation in the sector that produces the good, Mr. Sagers said.  But anyone bringing that against Amazon would have to explain why Walmart would not be a target, too.  \u2014 Peter Eavis  Photo  Public pension fund wants changes to Facebook\u2019s board.

Even with the recent tumble in its shares, Facebook is valued at more than $450 billion.  In his letter, Mr. Stringer calls on Facebook\u2019s independent directors to take four steps to help restore investor confidence.  Here are the proposed changes:  1) Add at least three new independent directors to improve the board\u2019s ability to oversee the evolving risks Facebook faces.  2) Name an independent director as chairman, allowing Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive and chairman, to focus on running the company.  3) Create a committee of independent directors to oversee the company\u2019s data privacy policies and risks.  4) Institute a clawback policy so that the board can \u201crecoup executive pay in the event of violations of law, regulation or company policy.\u201d  Photo  Trump tweets Amazon does not pay enough taxes.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Amazon and the company\u2019s founder, Jeff Bezos, are among Mr. Trump\u2019s regular Twitter targets. In December, Mr. Trump questioned whether the United States Post Office charges Amazon enough for package deliveries. And in August, Mr. Trump said Amazon hurts taxpaying businesses.  Amazon, however, does pay taxes \u2014 $412 million in 2016, for instance, according to the company\u2019s report to the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Axios reported on Wednesday that Mr. Trump has wondered aloud whether Amazon could be vulnerable to antitrust or competition laws.  \u201cTrump\u2019s wealthy friends tell him Amazon is destroying their businesses. His real estate buddies tell him \u2014 and he agrees \u2014 that Amazon is killing shopping malls and brick-and-mortar retailers.\u201d  Amazon shares fell more than 7 percent following that Axios article but recovered some of those losses after a White House official told Reuters that the company faced no particular policy changes. But the administration is always looking at its options, the official added. The stock closed down 4.4 percent Wednesday.  Shares were down nearly 2 percent in early trading.  Should shareholders worry? The GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives told Bloomberg that this regulatory threat was unlikely to change Amazon\u2019s business model, but it was still \u201cthe last thing nervous tech investors wanted to see today.\u201d  Retailers, at least, already have some reason to be cheerful.  And Amazon has another target market for expansion: housekeeping.  First quarter profits are going to be big.  Corporate American will start reporting first-quarter results in less than two weeks, and earnings are expected to be big.  Analysts estimate that profits at companies in the S.&P. 500 grew 17.3 percent this quarter, according to FactSet. If the forecasts prove accurate that would be highest earnings growth rate since the first quarter of 2011.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Perhaps most surprising, is that analysts have grown more optimistic on corporate earnings as the quarter progressed. The earnings forecast for the index rose 5.4 percent from the start of the quarter to the end. Typically, analysts lower their expectations as the quarter progresses. On average, the profit estimates for the index fall 3.7 percent from the start of the quarter to the end.  But there are reasons for investors to temper their enthusiasm. Analysts have not been as optimistic about the abilities of companies to increase sales. Revenue is expected to have grown 7.3 percent in the first quarter, up from a 7 percent rate at the start of the quarter.  That suggests analysts are not raising estimates because of increased sales. So why are they? Taxes. And the impact tax reform will have on bottom lines should moderate in the coming quarters.  That may already be happening. BofA Merrill Lynch\u2019s earnings revision ratio for the S.&P. 500 fell in March for the first time in three months. Of course, the pullback comes after the ratio hits the highest level on record in February, but it does suggest that earnings lift from tax reform has begun to wane.  Photo  Are we witnessing the end of a tech boom?  Investors, always willing to believe in technology companies, spent the last three years piling into their shares with abandon. Now the intellectual underpinnings of that rally are being tested.  Exhibit A: Facebook, down 20 percent from its recent high.  Exhibit B: Nvidia, off 12 percent from its recent high.  Exhibit C: Tesla, not a tech stock but in the FANG+ index.  Concerns about Tesla\u2019s ability to fund itself can also be seen in the trading of its debt.  The WSJ\u2019s Charley Grant explains:  Tesla can\u2019t simply cut spending to solve its cash challenge if it hopes to ramp up production. The company has racked up about $10 billion in long-term debt and has $23 billion in total liabilities. To survive long term, Tesla needs to stop overpromising and to scale back its ambitions to goals it actually can achieve. Right now, though, it just needs more money.  Peter Eavis notes that the latest problems for tech giants have raised deeper doubts:  After the Uber incident in Arizona, those companies may take a more realistic look at what they have to spend to create a technology that is efficient and safe, and conclude that they have to pull out of the race or pare back. Users of social media and regulators may prevent social media companies from sharing so much of their data with advertisers, and that could restrain revenue growth. And if the passion for two or three big tech companies wanes, the cooling may spread.  Photo  Barclays pays $2 billion to settle mortgage securities suit.

And all this has to happen at a competitive cost. There\u2019s a lot that can trip you up.\u201d  Even as he introduced the Model 3 at an event last summer, Mr. Musk warned that the company would find itself in \u201cproduction hell\u201d \u2014 and as those words proved prescient, he has had to repeatedly dial back his forecasts for how many Tesla could churn out.  Mr. Musk once envisioned producing as many as 500,000 cars this year, and last summer he was hoping to be able to make 20,000 Model 3s a month by December. More recently, Tesla had aimed to produce at least 2,500 Model 3s per week by the end of the first quarter.  But that is more than it managed in the entire fourth quarter, and it has produced fewer than 10,000 in the first quarter, the company said Tuesday.  There have been signs of momentum, however. In the past seven days, Tesla said, it had produced 2,020 Model 3s, a rate it said it expected to sustain in the coming week.  In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Tesla said it expected its output to \u201cclimb rapidly\u201d through the second quarter and reach 5,000 per week in about three months. It added that it was \u201crapidly addressing production and supply-chain bottlenecks, including several short factory shutdowns to upgrade equipment.\u201d  Tesla has closely guarded the details of its manufacturing system, but Mr. Musk has described it as highly automated.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Ron Harbour, a partner and auto-manufacturing specialist at Oliver Wyman, a consulting firm, said that adding more automated equipment tends to create a more complex production environment. \u201cYou have more new equipment to launch, there\u2019s more programming, more maintenance,\u201d he said. \u201cMore automation doesn\u2019t necessarily make it more efficient.\u201d  The highest-volume plants he\u2019s seen, Mr. Harbour added, often have more assembly workers and fewer robots. \u201cIt\u2019s a little counterintuitive, but that\u2019s how it is,\u201d he said.

With a starting price of $35,000, the Model 3 is more affordable than Tesla\u2019s other models and a crucial part of its ambitions to become a mass-market automaker \u2014 as well as to stabilize its finances and turn a profit.  But Mr. Wakefield noted that working out bottlenecks and hitches in auto production often isn\u2019t as straightforward as it could appear. For example, modifying one part to make it fit better or stronger can require other parts to be modified, or can alter the car\u2019s driving characteristics.  \u201cIf you make a change to solve one problem, you can create five other problems,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople think you just find a problem and solve it, but it\u2019s not like that. There are literally millions of problems that come up and require thousands of engineers, working in teams, either at the car company or the suppliers, to deal with.\u201d  While Tesla scrambled to work out the kinks in making the Model 3 in the first quarter, deliveries of the Model S and Model X declined by 23 percent from the previous quarter \u2014 to 21,800 \u2014 even as the company reported \u201cthe most productive quarter in Tesla history.\u201d  Tesla said it had been hurt by a shortage of battery packs for its cars, made at the plant it calls the Gigafactory, near Reno, Nev.  Michelle Krebs, a senior analyst at Autotrader.com, said the decline in deliveries of the Model S and Model X might suggest that the allure of Tesla vehicles has somewhat faded. Electric cars make up fewer than 1 percent of all vehicles sold in the United States.  \u201cYou just wonder if there\u2019s enough growth in electric vehicles,\u201d she said. \u201cAt first everybody who wanted a Tesla and could afford a Tesla hopped on. But it\u2019s not the newest thing anymore.\u201d  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  In its statement on Tuesday, the company said that \u201cdemand remains strong\u201d for the Model S and Model X. But a sustained slump in sales of those vehicles could complicate Tesla\u2019s efforts to trim the losses it has been reporting every three months \u2014 including a net loss of $771 million in the fourth quarter.  Even aside from its production struggles with the Model 3, the company has been hit by a barrage of negative news in recent weeks.  Concern has grown over the safety of Autopilot, its driver-assistance system, after a fatal crash on March 23 that occurred while the system was engaged. It was at least the third fatal crash that has taken place while a driver was using Autopilot.  On Friday, Tesla said the driver had not heeded several visual and audible warnings to put his hands on the steering wheel before his Model X hit a concrete barrier. Neither the driver nor the car appeared to activate the brakes before impact.  Also last week, Moody\u2019s Investors Service downgraded Tesla\u2019s credit rating and said the company risked running short of cash by the end of the year.  The company said Tuesday that it saw no need to take special measures this year to raise cash.

Ford sold 6.6 million vehicles last year, some 64 times Tesla\u2019s sales of 103,000. Ford earned $7.6 billion, which the market found disappointing. Tesla lost $2.24 billion on sales of $3.3 billion, which the market shrugged off, at least until recently. That tells you how the stock market values the future of both companies and of E.V.s in particular.  It\u2019s not a belief that\u2019s universally held. For at least a year, there has been open warfare between the Tesla believers and the Tesla skeptics and short sellers. The believers see the advance orders for the Model 3 as testimony to the company\u2019s disruptive brilliance. The Tesla shorts \u2014 investors who bet against the stock \u2014 see the company as an automotive Ponzi scheme. To them, the founder and chief executive, Elon Musk, is beginning to look more like Tesla\u2019s corporate eponym, Nikola Tesla, the brilliant but eccentric scientist who in 1888 created the alternating current electrical grid that powers the world today and who died penniless.  Yet you want to believe that Mr. Musk can pull this off. He rescued Tesla once before, when the company was days away from running out of cash. And in SpaceX, Mr. Musk has proved that he can run a highly sophisticated private spacecraft company.  Tesla\u2019s problem, unfortunately, isn\u2019t rocket science. In some ways it\u2019s more complex.  Tesla can\u2019t seem to run an auto production line, something that the Detroit auto companies that Mr. Musk mocks are very good at. Ford\u2019s electric vehicles and hybrids, such as the Fusion Energi, may not match the Tesla Model X in style or speed, but Ford can knock out millions of fenders and hoods in its stamping operations with absolute certainty and to tight specifications.  Tesla is operating out of the former G.M./Toyota joint venture plant in Fremont, Calif., which produced more than 400,000 cars annually at its peak. Tesla has been running at a quarter of that rate, and has had to resort to pulling cars off the line and finishing them by hand.

In recent days, though, Mr. Trump has targeted Amazon in tweets, asserting that the company has an unfair advantage. It\u2019s not clear what he could do to hurt Amazon\u2019s business, but the company\u2019s stock has plunged. Amazon\u2019s shares may well bounce back, but the criticism has added to investors\u2019 concerns about the outlook for large technology companies, whose soaring stock prices spearheaded the rally that took to the S.&P. 500 to its all-time high in January.  Too much blame can be placed on the White House, however.  Before investors began fretting about tech and trade, the underpinnings of the stock market\u2019s ascent were perhaps not as robust as they looked. Wall Street analysts expect earnings for the companies in the S.&P. 500 to increase 25 percent this year, according to data compiled by Standard & Poor\u2019s, an unusually large jump that was reflected in the stock market valuations. Much of that projected earnings increase is coming from tax cuts and some from expectations that companies\u2019 revenue would grow at a nice clip as global growth stayed strong.  The tax cuts are certainly going to improve profits. But rising interest rates around the world could weigh somewhat on companies\u2019 revenue growth. And if wages and other costs come in higher than expected \u2014 a significant possibility when the economy is suffering a shortage of some workers \u2014 profit margins could get squeezed. \u201cI don\u2019t think either of those are in the numbers,\u201d said Jim Paulsen, chief market strategist at the Leuthold Group.  \u2014 Peter Eavis  Photo  Not Funny  A little humor has not cleared the clouds over Tesla.  Shares in the company were once again sliding on Monday after the company\u2019s C.E.O., Elon Musk, joked on April 1 that Tesla had gone bankrupt, an apparent attempt to make light of concerns that the electric car maker is straining under its debt load.  Tesla\u2019s stock is now down 35 percent from its high of last year. A major reason for the slide is the company\u2019s struggles to meet production targets for its lower-priced Model 3 car. Delays, of course, raise questions about Tesla\u2019s ability to become an efficient mass producer of autos. The company needs to sell a significantly higher number of cars to generate the cash to finance its business and meet debt payments. Tesla is expected early this week to release its first-quarter production and delivery numbers.  Electrek, a publication that covers electric vehicles, reported late Monday morning that Mr. Musk had sent out an email to employees saying that the company was producing more than 2,000 Model 3s a week. Tesla\u2019s stock bounced after the report.  Tesla\u2019s technology is also facing intense scrutiny after one of its Model X cars crashed on March 23, killing the driver. Tesla said late Friday that its assisted driving system, called Autopilot, was engaged in the car before its collision with a concrete divider. As our colleague Neal E. Boudette wrote:  The accident renews questions about Autopilot, a signature feature of Tesla vehicles, and whether the company has gone far enough to ensure that it keeps drivers and passengers safe.  Tesla\u2019s website says one of Autopilot\u2019s safety features is \u201cAutomatic Emergency Braking.\u201d But a Tesla owner\u2019s manual warns riders that this feature \u201cis not designed to avoid a collision.\u201d Wired recently reported that systems like Autopilot are not necessarily designed to detect static obstacles. In the words of one expert:  Raj Rajkumar, who researches autonomous driving at Carnegie Mellon University, thinks those assumptions concern one of Tesla\u2019s key sensors. \u201cThe radars they use are apparently meant for detecting moving objects (as typically used in adaptive cruise control systems), and seem to be not very good in detecting stationary objects,\u201d he says.  Doubts about the fundamental capabilities of Tesla\u2019s Autopilot could crimp demand for its cars among a customer base that is often seeking the best technology.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Questions are also swirling around the timing of Tesla\u2019s announcement about the crash. In its first communication about the accident, the company said:  Out of respect for the privacy of our customer and his family, we do not plan to share any additional details until we conclude the investigation.  The investigation is not over. Yet Tesla went ahead and provided its update on Friday. The motive for doing so is not clear. The United States National Transportation Safety Board on Sunday said it was \u201cunhappy\u201d that Tesla had released information about the crash.  - Peter Eavis  Investors are running from FAANG stocks again.  Tech companies are again dragging down stocks on Wall Street.  The S.&P. 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite are off 3.1 percent and 3.5 percent Monday. The continued fall in the share prices of some of the biggest tech companies is weighing heavily on the indexes.  Amazon is down 5.4 percent, Netflix is off 5.9 percent, Facebook fell 3 percent, Google-parent Alphabet slipped 3.6 percent and Apple dropped 5.9 percent.  After leading the market higher for much of the past two years, tech stocks have hit some turbulence. Since March 16, Facebook, Alphabet, Netflix and Amazon are all down more than 12 percent, while Apple is down 7.3 percent.  Over that period the business models of those companies have come under increased scrutiny. News that Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm hired by President Trump\u2019s 2016 election campaign, gained access to private information on more than 50 million Facebook users has weighed not only on the shares of Facebook but on Alphabet as well. Amazon, meanwhile, has come under attack from President Trump.  In all, those companies have lost more than $300 billion in market value the past two weeks.  Photo  Trump continues to go after Amazon.  President Trump attacked the e-commerce again on Monday morning.  Monday\u2019s tweet is the latest over the past five days from Mr. Trump criticizing Amazon. Over that period, Mr. Trump has accused Amazon of not paying enough taxes, of putting thousands of local retailers out of business and of using the United States Postal Service as its \u201cDelivery Boy.\u201d  Mr. Trump\u2019s willingness to again single out Amazon and characterize it as a tax cheat and a job killer is a remarkable use of the presidential bully pulpit that could have serious implications for the company even without any formal moves by the federal government.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Amazon\u2019s shares are down 4 percent and are off nearly 11 percent since Axios reported on Wednesday about Mr. Trump\u2019s anger toward the company.  Context  \u2022 Amazon has said that the Postal Regulatory Commission, which oversees the service, has consistently found that its contracts with Amazon are profitable.  \u2022 The internet giant collects sales taxes on its own products in all 45 states that have one, but third-party vendors who sell products on the site often do not collect sales tax, a fact that rivals say is unfair. In addition, some municipalities complain that the company does not collect local taxes.  Critic\u2019s corner  DA Davidson analyst Tom Forte wrote in a note via Reuters:  \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s comments are consistent with industry sources we have spoken to in the shipping industry, who often label Amazon\u2019s deal with the USPS as a sweetheart deal. An argument, however, could be made that the USPS was losing billions before it expanded its service offerings for Amazon and would, still, likely lose billions if Amazon discontinued its use of the USPS tomorrow.\u201d  Intel isn\u2019t helping, either.  Shares of the chip maker are down 9 percent, their steepest decline in more than two years, after Bloomberg reported that Apple is planning to use its own chips in Mac computers beginning as early as 2020.  Citing anonymous sources, Bloomberg\u2019s Ian King and Matt Gurman report:  \u201cThe initiative, code named Kalamata, is still in the early developmental stages, but comes as part of a larger strategy to make all of Apple\u2019s devices \u2014 including Macs, iPhones, and iPads \u2014 work more similarly and seamlessly together.\u201d  Apple provides Intel with about 5 percent of its annual revenue.  Who says there are no rivalries in the hedge fund world?  Kenneth C. Griffin\u2019s Citadel has just hired Phil Villhauer, a former top trader at Steven A. Cohen\u2019s investment firm. Mr. Villhauer will become deputy head of global equities at Citadel, a newly created position. He will officially join the Chicago-based hedge fund in the middle of April and work out of Citadel\u2019s office in New York, a Citadel spokesman confirmed.  \u201cWe see this as a big hire for us,\u201d said Zia Ahmed, a Citadel spokesman.  Mr. Villhauer left Mr. Cohen\u2019s family office, Point72 Asset Management, in October after working for the billionaire investor for roughly 15 years. Mr. Villhauer had started at Mr. Cohen\u2019s former firm, SAC Capital Advisors, and most recently served as head of global trading at Point72.  The timing of Mr. Villhauer\u2019s departure came just months before Mr. Cohen was to begin managing money for outside investors.  In January, Mr. Cohen reconfigured Point72 as a hedge fund after establishing it as a family office in 2014 to manage $11 billion of his personal wealth. Point72 has said it has raised between $2 billion and $4 billion in outside money.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Mr. Villhauer had been with Mr. Cohen through both the good days and bad days. He was there when SAC turned into a powerhouse hedge fund, and he was there when the fund pleaded guilty to insider trading charges in 2013. The guilty plea required the firm to stop managing money for outside investors.  When Mr. Villhauer left Point72, Mr. Cohen, in a letter to employees, called the departure a \u201cretirement\u201d and said he was sad to see Mr. Villhauer go.  Now Mr. Villhauer will start a new chapter in his career at another well-known hedge fund firm.  ____________________________  Photo  Why Facebook\u2019s rivals have stayed mum  As Facebook lurches from crisis to crisis, other tech leaders like Marc Benioff and Tim Cook have criticized the company. But, for the most part, it\u2019s in their culture to stick together, Nick Wingfield writes.

They regained some ground, but took another beating during the financial crisis. G.E. stock was climbing again in recent years, but last year began falling again.  \u201cWhether founders or executives, these individuals have a different risk appetite than other W-2 earning individuals,\u201d said Jeff Schnitz, head of wealth advisory for Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s private bank. \u201cThey have the opportunity to accept risk, and to create upside opportunities for themselves.\u201d  Some chief executives are taking this to new extremes. Elon Musk recently proposed a new compensation plan at Tesla. If approved, he will receive billions of dollars in compensation if he manages to double, triple and quadruple the value of the company. He will receive nothing if he does not.  Rick Smith, the chief executive of Axon, followed Mr. Musk\u2019s lead and proposed a nearly identical plan, albeit with smaller targets for the market valuation.  Mr. Musk and Mr. Smith are outliers. But even for less ambitions executives, the same principle holds.  \u201cYou want the C.E.O. fully aligned and driving a strong return on the investment,\u201d said Shirl Penney, the founder of Dynasty Financial Partners. \u201cThe investors want the senior leadership team as all in as possible.\u201d  Not everyone is willing to put all their eggs in one basket, however. And for those making a mere few hundred thousand dollars, or even a few million a year, the need to diversify can be real.  Photo  \u201cFor someone who is more of a middle-line manager who is saving toward retirement, we would typically advise not having more than 10 percent of your net worth in any one security,\u201d said Mr. Penney. \u201cYou try to advise someone to liquidate as much of their stock as possible and put it into a more diversified portfolio.\u201d  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  That can be easy for an executive at a publicly traded company. But it can be virtually impossible for executives or founders at private start-ups, many of whom have preferred stock or founders shares that are illiquid until a sale or initial public offering.  \u201cSelling or diversifying out of that stock has not only a financial ramification for it, but could have ramifications around who much control they have,\u201d said Mr. Penney.  And when start-up executives and founders do sell, the results can vary widely. Peter Thiel, an early investor in Facebook, has sold most all of his shares in the company, even as he remains a board member. It\u2019s a prudent bet \u2014 Facebook shares are hovering near their all-time high.  Photo  But sometimes, selling too early can be disastrous. Ronald Wayne, a co-founder of Apple, sold his stake in the company for $800 in 1976. That stock would today have been worth about $90 billion today, making him one of the richest men in the world.  Even if an executive or founder does want to sell stock, they need to be careful about not timing any sales to create the impression that they have lost faith in the company, or were trading on nonpublic information.  Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich recently drew scrutiny for selling about $39 million worth of shares after the company learned of a major security flaw in its chips, but before the news was made public.  Intel said the sale was unrelated to security issues and was part of a prearranged annual trading plan.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Financial advisers said such considerations were left largely to the executives themselves. \u201cWe\u2019re not really in the business of talking to C.E.O.s about the public perception of what they want to do,\u201d said Scott Senseney, head of sales, marketing and communications for Fidelity\u2019s stock plan services group.  Sophisticated financial planners have myriad ways to minimize risk, beyond simply diversifying. Executives with large stock holdings can hedge their positions, minimizing downside risk. Sometimes it\u2019s possible to sell upside call options.  And in so-called exchange funds, executives from various companies will pool their stock into a fund run by an asset manager, diversifying their exposure without having to sell shares and pay any immediate capital gains taxes.  Even then, however, undue complexity can backfire. In 2012, the founder of Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, Robert Stiller, was ousted as chairman of his own company after he sold five million shares, worth about $125 million. His motivation: he had taken out loans against his sizable stake in Green Mountain, now known as Keurig Green Mountain, but when the value of the shares fell, Mr. Stiller was caught in a margin call.  The most common pitfall for executives who are rewarded with stock, however, is simply ignorance. Too often, planners say, executives don\u2019t know what they have, or what options they are entitled to. Frequently, people become aware of their options only at the last minute, or even after the fact.  \u201cThe worst-case scenario is that those options expire in the money,\u201d said Mr. Senseney. \u201cWaiting too long can be devastating. There can be millions of dollars of impact.\u201d", "stock": "TSLA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-22", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/22/your-money/equity-stock-compensation.html"}, {"article": "Tesla shares dropped 8 percent on Tuesday and another 8 percent Wednesday, and though they regained ground Thursday, they have lost almost a quarter of their value in less than three weeks.  Reflecting questions about Tesla\u2019s ability to pay off its debt, its bonds have slumped as well. Those that will mature in 2025 traded at about 88 cents on the dollar on Thursday.  A Tesla representative declined to comment on the company\u2019s finances.  But the company\u2019s recent troubles extend beyond its balance sheet. Federal investigators are looking into a fiery crash that killed a Tesla driver last week in California, including the possibility that Autopilot was in use. (Autopilot was in use during a 2016 crash in Florida that killed a Tesla driver, but safety officials concluded that the crash did not result from a flaw in the system but found it lacked safeguards to prevent its misuse.)  And on Thursday, Tesla said it was recalling 123,000 Model S cars made before April 2016 to replace bolts that hold a power-steering motor in place. The bolts can become corroded and break, leaving drivers with only manual steering. The company said no crashes or injuries related to the issue had been reported.  Tesla\u2019s reversal of fortune is a jolt for both the company and its chief executive, who had built a reputation not only as a visionary but also as an achiever, masterminding an automotive brand, breaking ground on a battery plant that would be the world\u2019s biggest building, and launching rockets through his SpaceX venture.  For years, Tesla has ridden a wave of enthusiastic support from its customers and a certain set of investors, even though it generated barely any profit in the 15 years since its founding. Company events to present new models tend to have the feel of a religious revival, with hundreds or thousands of owners cheering wildly at each new pronouncement from Mr. Musk. Anticipation for the Model 3 prompted nearly 400,000 prospective customers to put down deposits of $1,000 each.  In November, before a screaming audience of several hundred guests, Mr. Musk unveiled a battery-powered semi truck and a two-seat roadster. He vowed to begin producing the truck by the end of 2019, even though the company does not have a factory to build it, and is still trying to work the kinks out of the Model 3 assembly process at its manufacturing plant in Fremont, Calif.

You add all that up and there\u2019s a real question about whether this company can deliver what it promises.\u201d  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  There\u2019s no doubt Tesla has achieved some breakthroughs that have left the established automakers scrambling to catch up. It has proved that there is a viable market for electric cars, and that they can command premium prices. It has pioneered methods of upgrading cars through software updates beamed over the air, the way iPhones can download new operating systems.  And it was Autopilot that set off a race to develop advanced driver-assistance systems that can guide cars under certain circumstances and actively prevent collisions \u2014 though Tesla\u2019s technology appears to have been surpassed by the self-driving systems from other companies, including G.M. and the Google spinoff Waymo.  Along the way, Mr. Musk has also courted controversy, including his move in 2016 for Tesla to take over SolarCity, a maker of home solar panels run by his cousin. A group of investors has filed a lawsuit contending that Mr. Musk had a conflict of interest because he was SolarCity\u2019s chairman, and this week a judge cleared the way for the case to go forward.  In January, Tesla gave Mr. Musk a new compensation plan tied entirely to the company\u2019s market value and other performance goals. If he hits all of the goals, he could be rewarded with stock worth more than $50 billion.  But the company has repeatedly failed to meet its own targets and deadlines, especially with the Model 3. Mr. Musk originally predicted that the Model 3 would arrive in 2017 and that the car would push the company\u2019s sales to 500,000 cars a year by 2018. He later lowered his prediction to 100,000 Model 3s in 2017. Backtracking again, he said last August that the company hoped to make 20,000 a month by December, and added that \u201cpeople should have zero concerns\u201d about Tesla\u2019s ability to increase its output of the Model 3.  But in the fourth quarter of last year, Tesla made only 2,425 Model 3s. In its most recent plan, it hopes to lift production to 2,500 Model 3s a week. The company is expected to release first-quarter production totals in early April.  The Model 3 is crucial. The company needs to ramp up its Model 3 business to generate revenue so that it can pay back investors and fund development of future vehicles including its electric truck.  Moody\u2019s concluded that Tesla probably needed to raise more than $2 billion from investors to be able to finance its operations, continue capital investment and pay debts and other financial obligations that will come due soon. According to Moody\u2019s, Tesla has $200 million in convertible bonds due later this year, and $900 million due in early 2019.  \u201cLiquidity is going to be very tight by the end of the year,\u201d Bruce Clark, a senior vice president at Moody\u2019s, said in an interview. \u201cThey need to re-establish credibility with the capital markets.\u201d", "stock": "TSLA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-29", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/29/business/tesla-elon-musk.html"}, {"article": "Technology stocks helped propel the nine-year bull market. Optimistic investors piled into the shares, hoping to grab a piece of the profits from industries such as social media, autonomous driving, video streaming and artificial intelligence.

The Nasdaq composite, laden with technology stocks, sank 2.9 percent after a flurry of bad news about specific companies metastasized into a broad retreat from technology stocks.

Worth remembering: Arguably the wage raises have as much to do with tight labor markets and the desire of companies to keep existing employees or attract new ones as they do with the tax code change.  \u2014 Michael J. de la Merced  Photo  Mick Mulvaney to C.F.P.B. staff: No more envelope-pushing  From a memo that Mr. Mulvaney, who is the acting chief (or one of two, depending on whom you ask) of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, sent to the agency\u2019s staffers today:  Indeed, I think it is fair to say that the previous governing philosophy here was to aggressively \u201cpush the envelope\u201d in pursuit of the \u201cmission;\u201d that we were the \u201cgood guys\u201d and the \u201cnew sheriff in town,\u201d out to fight the \u201cbad guys.\u201d Simply put: that is what is going to be different. In fact, that entire governing philosophy of pushing the envelope frightens me a little. I would hope it would bother you as well.  And:  Writ large, I intend to exercise our statutory authority to enforce the laws of this nation. I intend to execute the statutory mandate of the Bureau to protect consumers. But we will no longer go beyond that mandate. If Congress wants us to do more than is set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act, they can change the law. Until then, we will enforce the law as currently written.  The context: Mr. Mulvaney, a longtime critic of the C.F.P.B., has been working to rein in the bureau, a longtime target of Republican ire.  \u2014 Michael J. de la Merced  Photo  Tension at the top of Airbnb  The home rental company\u2019s C.E.O., Brian Chesky, isn\u2019t always seeing eye to eye with his C.F.O., Laurence Tosi, according to an article in The Information.  In one instance, Mr. Chesky thought about starting an airline as Airbnb weighed a move into the air travel business. Mr. Tosi insisted on a lower-key approach of partnering with an existing app, according to the news site.  The context: Mr. Tosi was brought in from Blackstone to help professionalize one of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest unicorn darlings, much as Ruth Porat joined Alphabet from Morgan Stanley. That was more than likely to foster a clash between Silicon Valley idealism and Wall Street pragmatism.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  More from Cory Weinberg of The Information:  Mr. Tosi, who moved with his wife and two young children to the Bay Area for the Airbnb job, has tried to fit in, swapping Wall Street suits for jeans and vests. But his arrival also was a shock to Airbnb\u2019s culture, with its emphasis on an idealistic brand. Mr. Tosi sent marching orders across the company in 2016 that it had to get profitable. Before Airbnb could go public, it would have to have a better handle on predicting its earnings. \u201cI believe we have built this path but can do more,\u201d he wrote to employees. Mr. Tosi initiated cost-cutting efforts, including cuts to customer service and food staff, that longtime Airbnb employees saw as hurting the culture. But Airbnb\u2019s cost per customer service \u201cticket\u201d fell by 30% to 40% between 2016 and mid-2017 last year, an Airbnb official said, thanks largely to Mr. Tosi.  Why it matters: Airbnb is expected to pursue an I.P.O. as soon as next year. Which vision for the company will win out?  \u2014 Michael J. de la Merced  Was there fraud at KPMG?  The charges against five former employees of KPMG and a former government accountant show the lengths an accounting firm will go to get a good report from the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.  The indictment is a bit odd, though, because the defendants are accused of defrauding both the S.E.C. and the accounting board. They used confidential information to help deal with potential problems in KPMG\u2019s audits. But did getting a sneak peek at how they would be evaluated constitute theft, or just a form of cheating?  Fraud is a type of larceny, and normally the perpetrator obtains something from the victim, who suffers a loss. But in this case, the scheme was to help KPMG clean up its act to get a better grade in pending reviews.  In the world of white-collar crime, most fraud prosecutions involve at least some form of tangible gain to the defendants, and not a better report card. Courts have also required prosecutors to show there was at least some harm to the victim from the misuse of their property.  One way around this issue would be to charge a breach of the honest services statute, but that\u2019s not in the indictment. Nor did the Justice Department charged them under a law prohibiting the theft of government records. The S.E.C. did not accuse the accountants of securities fraud, only that they engaged in unethical or improper professional conduct.  A statement by Steven Peikin, the co-director of the S.E.C.\u2019s enforcement division, said that the defendants were \u201cliterally stealing the exam.\u201d I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s quite accurate, however, as it was more like learning when the teacher would give a pop quiz.

That\u2019s under a new compensation plan that Andrew reported first today. Critics, and there are many, may regard it as yet another publicity stunt by the electric car marker, which has struggled to meet production targets for its Model 3.  But Mr. Musk and the head of the Tesla board\u2019s compensation committee said the arrangement would benefit shareholders, since it\u2019s directly linked to company performance.  Here\u2019s what Mr. Musk told Andrew:  \u201cIf all that happens over the next 10 years is that Tesla\u2019s value grows by 80 or 90 percent, then my amount of compensation would be zero,\u201d he said. (His calculations were based on the stock price at the beginning of this year, when the company was worth about $50 billion.)  Trivia: California law requires that Tesla pay Mr. Musk minimum wage, even though he doesn\u2019t want a salary. So it cuts him a check for a little over $37,000 each year, which he never cashes.

Putting the Model 3 into mass production is a critical task for Tesla. The company has taken $1,000 deposits from about 400,000 customers interested in buying the car. If it can begin producing the car rapidly, its sales and revenue will soar and it could vault into profitability.  Just two years ago, Mr. Musk hoped to make 500,000 by 2018, and the ambitious forecast helped push Tesla\u2019s market value above that of General Motors and Ford Motor for a period in 2017.  In July, as Model 3 production was about to begin, Mr. Musk ratcheted back expectations, resetting his target to 20,000 vehicles a month by December. But difficulties producing battery packs at Tesla\u2019s Nevada plant, called the Gigafactory, and other glitches in the car\u2019s assembly process combined to slow output to a crawl.  Tesla built just 260 by the end of September. In January, it said it had made only 2,425 in the final quarter of 2017, and set a goal of increasing output to 5,000 a month by the end of the first quarter.  Mr. Musk said Tesla had developed a new automated production line that would be installed in the Gigafactory in March, easing hitches in supplying batteries to its assembly plant in Fremont, Calif., which was once operated jointly by Toyota Motor and General Motors.

Mr. Musk said it aimed eventually to produce 500,000 Model 3s a year.  \u201cThey haven\u2019t delivered what they\u2019ve promised, but does it matter?\u201d said Michelle Krebs, an analyst at Autotrader.com. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem to matter to their investors and the customers who\u2019ve put down deposits. When investors don\u2019t put any more money into the company, then you will know it\u2019s a problem.\u201d  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  On a positive note, Tesla reported it used up only $277 million in cash in the fourth quarter. That was down from $1.4 billion in the third quarter. On a full-year basis, however, the company used nearly $3.5 billion in cash, more than twice the amount from 2016.  The company\u2019s loss in the quarter amounted to $3.04 per share on an adjusted basis, slightly less than analysts had forecast, and $4.01 unadjusted.  Tesla has lost money in eight of the last nine quarters. Mr. Musk said he was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d that it would begin to generate net income in 2018, as Model 3 production and deliveries rose.  The company\u2019s shares were little changed in extended trading after the earnings report. They had risen 3.3 percent during the regular session.  Even if Model 3 output rises, Tesla will have to spend heavily on two future vehicles \u2014 a battery-powered semi truck and another car, the Model Y.  While working on the Model 3, Mr. Musk has continued to seek new barriers to break in other areas.  On Tuesday, his other company, SpaceX, successfully launched a heavy rocket into space. It was the first time a rocket that powerful had been launched by a private company. The Falcon Heavy is carrying a cherry-red Tesla Roadster. The rocket and the car are intended to go into an orbit around the sun, where they could remain for hundreds of millions of years.  \u201cIf we can send a Roadster to the asteroid belt,\u201d Mr. Musk said Wednesday, \u201cI think we can solve Model 3 production.\u201d", "stock": "TSLA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-07", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/07/business/tesla-musk.html"}, {"article": "\u201cOne of our priorities will be to equip our 189 dealerships with 800-volt DC fast chargers,\u201d said Klaus Zellmer, president and chief executive of Porsche Cars North America. \u201cWe have just installed six at our Porsche Experience centers in Atlanta and will roll them out at our experience center in Los Angeles, too.\u201d  As part of its settlement with the California Air Resources Board and the United States Environmental Protection Agency over its diesel emission test cheating, Volkswagen, Porsche\u2019s parent company, is also building a network of 2,800 DC fast chargers by June 2019.  Photo  The Cross Turismo introduced on Tuesday is part of the other half of this two-pronged approach. Although it is officially a concept vehicle, it is expected to be an accurate preview of what buyers will see from Porsche after the Mission E vehicles go into production next year. While no pricing has been announced, the sedan version could run close to the existing Panamera, which begins at $85,000, compared with the $74,500 base price of a Tesla Model S 75D.  The Mission E vehicles are hardly alone in jockeying for position in the premium electric market. Last week, Jaguar unveiled the production version of its fully electric I-Pace crossover, which is scheduled to glide into showrooms in the second half of 2018. The Jaguar I-Pace, the carmaker\u2019s first electric vehicle, will start at $69,500 in the United States; a Tesla Model X starts at $79,500.  Audi has announced it will ship its e-tron quattro to European showrooms this fall and to the United States in early 2019. And Volvo plans an all-electric version of its XC40 crossover in 2019.  Porsche, Jaguar, Audi and other long-established carmakers have watched as Tesla has sprinted ahead, but Tesla will soon lose one crucial benefit that the later arrivals may be able to use to close the gap: tax benefits. At some point this year, Tesla will produce its 200,000th car. (General Motors, which makes the Chevrolet Bolt EV and Volt electric vehicles, will most likely reach that mark in 2018, too.) At that milestone, federal tax credits will begin to phase out.  It\u2019s not clear whether the new upscale choices will hurt Tesla or simply expand the segment. Dave Guilford, a managing editor for Crain\u2019s Automotive News, suggested that \u201cit\u2019s probably a little bit of both.\u201d  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  \u201cYou could see when Porsche unveiled the Mission E it was aiming right at Tesla,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful car. New entries in the premium segment give it credibility.\u201d  The wagonlike all-wheel-drive Cross Turismo could be a compelling alternative to the Model X. Its 440-kilowatt system uses two permanent synchronous electric motors and a floor-mounted lithium-ion battery pack that Porsche claims will propel the Cross Turismo to 60 miles per hour in 3.5 seconds. It will also employ an air suspension that can add nearly two inches of ground clearance and rear-wheel steering that will help it in the corners. At 15 feet long, the Cross Turismo concept is about four inches shorter than the company\u2019s Macan crossover and 18 inches shorter than a Tesla Model X.  The concept\u2019s interior features a free-standing instrument cluster screen with three circular display graphics. A camera with eye-tracking ability recognizes which graphic the driver is looking at and moves it forward while reducing the size of the others. Porsche executives suggested that the technology was being considered for the production car.

There have also been quality issues; Consumer Reports ranked the Model X among the 10 least-reliable vehicles in its survey, and there have been well-documented fit and finish problems.  That has provided an opening not just for the luxury carmakers, but for the rest of the industry to join General Motors and Nissan, which makes the Leaf electric vehicle, in challenging Tesla\u2019s Model 3.

It is also facing an investor lawsuit related to Tesla\u2019s acquisition of SolarCity, a solar-panel maker where Mr. Musk was serving as chairman.

It can steer, brake and accelerate automatically with little input from the driver. Tesla readily points out that Autopilot \u2014 despite the implications in its name \u2014 is only a driver-assistance system and is not intended to pilot cars on its own.  Drivers are given warnings on the dashboard and in the owner\u2019s manual to remain engaged and alert while using it. Tesla originally described it as a \u201cbeta\u201d version, a term that usually refers to software still in the developmental stage.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  At the time of the Florida crash, it was possible to engage Autopilot and cruise on highways for several minutes without the driver holding the steering wheel. In that crash, the Autopilot\u2019s camera, then the primary sensor in the system, failed to recognize a white truck as it was crossing a rural highway. Tesla said the camera was confused because the truck appeared against a bright sky.  Software modifications introduced that fall included more frequent warnings to drivers to keep their hands on the steering wheel. After three warnings, the new software prevents Autopilot from operating until the driver stops, turns off the car and restarts.  The new version also made radar the primary sensor, and Mr. Musk said the new radar would have been able to see the truck in the Florida crash despite the bright sky.  Autopilot does not use lidar \u2014 a kind of radar based on lasers \u2014 that Waymo and others have maintained are crucial for fully autonomous vehicles. Mr. Musk has said he believes lidar is not necessary for Autopilot to be safe.  At least three people have now died while driving with Autopilot engaged. In January 2017, a Chinese owner was at the wheel of a Model S when the car crashed into a road sweeper on a highway.  The National Transportation Safety Board is now investigating the March 23 crash that killed Mr. Huang. Its investigation of the 2016 Florida accident concluded that Autopilot \u201cplayed a major role,\u201d and said that it lacked safeguards to prevent misuse by drivers.  An earlier investigation, by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration, said that the company\u2019s Autopilot-enabled vehicles did not need to be recalled. That inquiry, however, focused only on the question of whether any flaws in the system had led to the crash; it found no such flaws.", "stock": "TSLA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-31", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/31/business/tesla-crash-autopilot-musk.html"}, {"article": "Despite this wave of negative publicity, it seems clear that Tesla will rise or fall based on the performance, safety, design and value of its cars. If it gets those things right, all the other issues will sort themselves out. Tesla has already defied skeptics and attracted legions of die-hard fans by surmounting seemingly impossible odds to build all-electric cars that have drawn lavish praise from automotive critics.  That includes the Model 3, which Popular Mechanics named its 2018 Car of the Year. (It was a finalist for Motor Trend\u2019s similar award. That it lost out to the Alfa Romeo Giulia has drawn howls of online protest.)  When my Model 3 test vehicle pulled up to the curb on Eighth Avenue, it didn\u2019t quite stop pedestrian traffic the way opening the gull-wing doors on the Model X had, but I could see why the automotive press is so excited. The interior features a single slab of wood sweeping around the cockpit interrupted only by a touch-screen interface that houses nearly all the controls, many of them voice activated.  With its Zen minimalism, it doesn\u2019t look or feel like any other car I\u2019ve been in. The synthetic-leather seats are comfortable, and there\u2019s ample room for someone my size (6-foot-3). This all comes at a cost: $57,500 for this luxurious long-range version, far from the $35,000 base price that has excited many potential Tesla buyers.  The Model 3 may not have the rocketlike acceleration of the X, but I found it nimble and responsive. I easily accelerated from a full stop into traffic flowing at highway speed, usually a nerve-racking maneuver in a conventional car. Driving the Model 3 was such a pleasure I was reluctant to cede any control to Autopilot.  For someone with decades of experience driving a conventional car, my first taste of semiautonomous driving last fall had come as a shock. The sensation of a vehicle moving on its own was so bizarre that I instinctively gripped the steering wheel, which immediately transferred control back to me.  This time I was more relaxed, willing to see how the car would behave. I gave the voice-activated navigation system a destination (Garden State Plaza, a New Jersey shopping mall about 20 miles away), and the car accelerated, braked, stayed in the center of the lane and maintained a comfortable three-car distance ahead of me, all without my intervention. At the mall, it detected an empty parking place, and flawlessly backed into it.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  One of its most impressive features is the ability for the driver to change lanes simply by pressing the turn-signal lever.

Although I\u2019d been briefed on its limitations, so successful was Autopilot that I was tempted to let down my guard by not bothering to look in the rearview mirror. That would have been a mistake.  For all its vision capabilities (including in darkness), Autopilot became confused when lanes weren\u2019t clearly marked or split in two or at exit ramps. You can\u2019t simply program the destination and let the car find its way. It\u2019s reassuringly cautious about changing lanes, but in heavy traffic, I would have missed an exit while waiting for it to find a suitable opening, and had to assert manual control.  While heading south on the New Jersey Turnpike, I could see in the rearview mirror a BMW bearing down at high speed. I pushed the turn signal for a lane change, and despite its ultrasonic sensors, the Tesla seemed oblivious to the onrushing car. It started to move into its lane; the driver laid on his horn, and I had to grab control to avoid an accident.  Blog posts indicate that other drivers have experienced the same issue.  The Tesla owner\u2019s manual describes this situation as one that the system can\u2019t yet manage. Tesla said it expected future upgrades to solve the problem, but for now, drivers need to be as attentive to the rearview mirror as with any other car.  Tesla had no comment for this column.  At this juncture, Autopilot is a misnomer, as many others have observed. \u201cThis is not self-driving technology,\u201d said Bryan Reimer, a research scientist and expert on autonomous vehicle technology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cIt\u2019s a collaborative system that leaves responsibility for safety in the drivers\u2019 hands and isn\u2019t intended to let them sit in the back seat or pursue other activities while driving.\u201d Even though some companies have said they plan driverless ride services in as little as two years, Mr. Reimer said full automation was likely to be many years or even decades in the future.  Self-driving automation systems are ranked from zero (no automation) to 5 (full automation). Tesla\u2019s Autopilot is Level 2. It requires drivers to keep at least one hand on the wheel. The car issues a prompt if it doesn\u2019t detect a hand on the wheel, and Autopilot shuts down if there\u2019s no response. In the Mountain View accident, Tesla has said, the driver \u201creceived several visual and one audible hands-on warning,\u201d but \u201cthe driver\u2019s hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds prior to the collision.\u201d  Given that this was my first extended drive using Autopilot, I was hypervigilant, maybe even more so than in a conventional car. I\u2019m told that wears off in time, as using Autopilot becomes second nature. The risk is that complacency contributes to driver inattention. Mr. Reimer and other experts are conducting research into the issue.  \u201cAs technology supplants human performance,\u201d Mr. Reimer said, \u201cthe bigger question is how safe is safe enough. If lane-changing technology is 50 percent more effective than humans, is that good enough? That\u2019s the big question no one wants to answer.\u201d  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  At the same time, he said, he worries that \u201cintense media coverage of accidents like Mountain View will scare people off.\u201d He said it was too soon to draw any conclusions from that fatality, but noted that Tesla\u2019s excellent safety record over the many millions of miles its cars have now traveled suggested that using Autopilot \u201ccan\u2019t be substantially more risky than conventional controls.\u201d (There were more than 40,000 traffic fatalities in the United States last year.)  After investigating a fatal 2016 crash involving a Tesla S and a tractor-trailer in Florida, the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration found no flaws in the Autopilot system. The National Transportation Safety Board concluded that Autopilot had performed as intended, but that the driver had become overly reliant on the technology.  After my drive in the Model 3, my sense is that even with its flaws, Tesla\u2019s Autopilot is a vast improvement over conventional controls, and enhances (rather than supplants) the driving experience. I\u2019m tempted to join the Model 3 waiting list, which numbers over 400,000 customers.  Investors, too, seem to have reassessed Tesla\u2019s recent bad news.

The I-Pace is Jaguar's first electric car. The SUV was revealed at the beginning of March after a year languishing in its concept stage, and it's a vehicle that's caught the attention of many a car enthusiast. The reason: it's pitting itself up against the might of the Tesla Model X .  And now it has one-upped Musk's baby with the Jaguar I-Pace becoming the first premium electric car to make its way on to Waymo's burgeoning fleet of cars.  Waymo where that came from  According to Jaguar Land Rover, the team-up with Waymo is a long-term strategic collaboration with shared goals of making cars safer, freeing up people's time and essentially improving mobility for everyone.  A whopping 20,000 I-Pacess will be built in the first two years of production, thanks to the partnership, and these will be available for those using Waymo's driverless service in the US.  This isn't the first time Jaguar Land Rover has shown off its self-driving skills. It recently revealed it was upping its self-driving game on the streets of the UK, demoing a self-driving F-Pace that can not only park itself but also find a parking space for you.  Speaking about the link-up John Krafcik, CEO of Waymo, said: \"While we've been focused at Waymo on building the world's most experienced driver, the team at Jaguar Land Rover has developed an all-new battery-electric platform that looks to set a new standard in safety, design and capability.  \"We're sure Waymo riders will enjoy the safe, premium and delightful experience that the self-driving I-Pace will provide.\"", "stock": "TSLA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-27", "source": "techradar", "url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/jaguar-i-pace-self-driving-car-revealed-premium-electric-car-joins-waymo-fleet"}, {"article": "The Tesla Model 3 has been beset by low production numbers since launch, and while CEO Elon Musk has stepped in to get manufacturing up to speed, those who ordered an all-wheel drive (AWD) model of the car have a bit longer to wait.

However, no accidents or injuries have been recorded in connection with the defect, Tesla says \u2013 this is a proactive move designed to stop the defect from developing.  \"If the bolts fail, the driver is still able to steer the car, but increased force is required due to loss or reduction of power assist,\" says Tesla. \"This primarily makes the car harder to drive at low speeds and for parallel parking, but does not materially affect control at high speed, where only small steering wheel force is needed.\"  Bad timing  If your Model S is affected and you have been sent an email, Tesla says you're still okay to carry on driving \u2013 just make sure you schedule an appointment with a local Tesla garage.

It's not quite a big as the Model X, with the new Jaguar offering seats for up to five adults, while the Tesla can go to seven seats.

Jaguar also says the I-Pace will be able to do 0-60mph in 4.5 seconds, ensuring that it has enough punch from the get-go. It's not quite as brisk as Tesla's 0-60 in 2.9 seconds Ludicrous Mode - but that is a pricey optional extra.  In terms of charging, from 50kW chargers you'll be able to replenish from 0% to 80% in 85 minutes, while a 30 minute charge will be good for around 80 miles of travel. It is also compatible with the 100kW fast chargers, allowing you top up even quicker with the 0% to 80% time slashed to 40 minutes.

Starting at $35,000, it has a claimed 220 miles of range, is fitted with all of the hardware necessary to drive fully autonomously (Tesla says), and might one day be spoken about by historians in the same breath as the Ford Model T and Citroen 2CV.  At least, that was the case two years ago. Now, as Model 3 production finally speeds up and there\u2019s a chance it might be available in the UK and Europe by the very end of the year, Tesla finds it no longer has the EV market to itself.  General Motors, Ford, Jaguar Land Rover and the Volkswagen Group are all poised to launch electric vehicles of their own, and they will do so with a century of experience behind them.  This gives us the perfect opportunity to take stock and evaluate the current situation with electric cars.  How do EVs work?  Fundamentally, electric cars work in broadly the same way as ones powered by petrol, diesel or even hydrogen. There is a fuel source, a drive unit, and a gearbox to provide motion forwards and backwards. Above this there are passenger and luggage compartments.  Electric vehicles (EVs) are still cars, and anyone who has driven an automatic vehicle will feel immediately at home behind the wheel of one.  There is a distinct lack of engine noise, of course, and the initial acceleration of EVs is often greater than that of an similarly sized internal combustion car. Or, in the case of the Tesla Model S P100D, EVs can literally be the quickest accelerating cars on sale today.  The Kia Soul EV's battery pack  Due to their huge weight, the batteries of EVs are fitted to the floor. This not only offers a large and mostly flat space for the cells to sit, but also helps to lower the car\u2019s centre of gravity.  Although they weigh comfortably over two tonnes, the Tesla Model S and Model X offer decent handling because of the heavy battery being low down.  They, like other EVs, also benefit from extra cabin space thanks to there being no transmission tunnel between the seats.  Are EVs different to drive?  The biggest different between internal combustion engine (ICE) and EV cars during everyday driving is the latter\u2019s regenerative braking system, which captures kinetic energy (caused by the forward motion of the car) and feeds it into the battery whenever you lift off the accelerator.  EVs still have a brake pedal, but it can be used less often due to extra retardation caused by the regen system.  Whenever people ask us about electric cars, or when we've with someone when they drive an EV for the first time, we explain how regenerative braking is the biggest difference during everyday driving.  Nissan currently advertises the new electric Leaf by talking about its \u2018one-pedal\u2019 operation, where the accelerator is used to speed up and slow down.  This is true, in a way, but the Leaf - as with all cars - still has a brake pedal. It just doesn\u2019t need to be used very often, because electric cars slow down far more abruptly than ICE cars do when you lift off the accelerator.  The best way to think about it is this: lifting off the accelerator a little causes the car to slow gradually, while lifting further or fully off the pedal causes it to slow more sharply, and the brake lights will come on.  Indeed, we\u2019ve often found we can leave a motorway and use only the accelerator pedal to slow down to walking pace by the time we reach the junction.  It only takes a few hours with an EV to drive with one pedal almost all of the time. You only really need the brake pedal in emergencies, when coming to a complete halt, or when driving on a cold morning, before the battery pack and regen system has had time to warm up.  Why electric?  There are many reasons to consider an EV over an ICE car. The obvious one is the lack of localized emissions.  We say localized because, while the car doesn't have an exhaust so can\u2019t contribute to city center smog like a petrol or diesel car, there is still pollution caused during the construction of the car - and in many cases the production of the electricity it runs on, too.  There are many debates to be had here, regarding the environmental impact of producing electricity from a gas or coal-fired power station, and what happens to the lithium battery pack once the car is no longer roadworthy, but that is for another article.  The all-electric Nissan Leaf  Other benefits of EV ownership include no need to buy engine oil, and less of a need for replacing the disc brakes and pads, because of the regenerative braking I mentioned earlier.  EVs are also quiet, very easy to drive, have automatic gearboxes, and filling the battery with electricity is cheaper than using petrol or diesel to go a similar distance.  If you install a charger at home (as almost all EV owners do) and power this with solar panels, then you can reasonably expect some car journeys to cost you nothing at all.  In some cases you will find parking is reduced or free (as is the case in some London boroughs to promote EV adoption), and there is also no London Congestion Charge or road tax.  In the US, federal tax incentives range from $2,500 to $7,500 for each EV purchased, but this offer will only last until each manufacturer has produced 200,000 electric vehicles.  Tesla will reach that milestone in 2018, and from there the incentive value will gradually decrease. Unless the system changes, many of the 400,000-plus Model 3 reservations holders will receive no discount at all.  It is also worth remembering these are all measures to try and incentive EV ownership, so once EVs become the norm it is likely that these discounts will be adjusted or abolished.  Some public chargers are free, and so too is Tesla\u2019s Supercharger network providing you own a qualifying car, or bought your car with a referral code from a fellow Tesla owner.  What about hybrids?  Hybrids come in several different configurations. First there is the regular hybrid, like older generations of Toyota Prius, which uses both a petrol engine and small electric motor.  The car charges its battery pack using brake regeneration, and can drive itself solely on battery power for short periods of time.  You may well see Prius drivers set off from traffic lights in silent electric mode, but the engine will kick in when they accelerate more firmly. Hybrids like these cannot be plugged in to charge the battery.  Volvo XC90 T8 plug-in hybrid  Plug-in electric vehicles (PHEV) are becoming increasingly common and act as a half-way house between ICE and full electric.  They can run like a regular hybrid, only topping up the battery when coasting and braking, but can also be plugged in to a public EV charger.  These cars can often cover the daily commute without using their engine, and PHEV technology already appears on a wide range of vehicles, including the VW Golf GTE, Mini Countryman Hybrid and Range Rover P400e.  There\u2019s still an internal combustion engine to maintain, but a nightly charge of the battery means you might not need to use it very often if your commute is short. For example, the Golf GTE and new Range Rover each have an electric range of 31 miles.  Potential lifestyle changes  Living with an EV requires some lifestyle changes. Because public chargers are owned and operated by a number of different companies, you will need to obtain a membership - and often a contactless membership card - for the ones you think you\u2019ll need to use.  It\u2019s a frustrating situation and feels shortsighted - imaging not being able to buy petrol from BP because you only have a membership with Shell - but hopefully this will become simpler as EV adoption spreads.  Next you will need to work out how far your EV can go, and how factors like the temperature affect this. EVs lose charge more quickly in cold weather than in the summer, as the battery takes a longer time to warm up and, just like any lithium battery, is less efficient when the temperature falls.  Kia Soul EV  Manufacturers all provide range claims for their EVs, just like they offer MPG figures with ICE cars - but your mileage will certainly vary. And because EV chargers are less common than petrol stations, you\u2019ll need to put some effort into planning any unfamiliar journeys before setting off.  Also, because chargers are sometimes already in use, or broken, it\u2019s worth having a contingency plan to keep the range anxiety at bay.  Maps of public EV chargers are widely available, and the satellite navigation of some EVs - like the BMW i3 - can guide you to the nearest charger.  Teslas all take into account the company\u2019s Supercharger network whenever you use the sat-nav to get somewhere, and take charge time into account when working out your estimated time of arrival.  For now, owning an EV is only really possible if you have off-street parking at home and space to install a charger. This means those who live in town and city centers - and residents in apartment blocks - will likely be out of luck, unless you are happy to always use public chargers, or perhaps your office has one you can use.  In short, owning an EV requires more journey planning, and those journeys will take longer than with an ICE car when charging en route is required. But these drawbacks are slowly being eradicated, and will continue to fade as EV adoption grows.  Once home chargers are more widely installed - and chargers are included in the car park of new apartment blocks - charging your car at night will become as instinctive as plugging in your phone.", "stock": "TSLA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-04-10", "source": "techradar", "url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/evs-explained"}, {"article": "Elon Musk is no stranger to making bold claims on Twitter to drum up excitement.

That\u2019s what happened recently after testing a 2018 Cadillac CT6 sedan for a week, driving along a highway during a morning commute and then all the way across an entire state for about three hours, all without using the steering wheel.  Cadillac first announced Super Cruise several years ago, and it was a shot across the bow for competitors like Tesla, Mercedes-Benz and Audi \u2013 companies that are all working on similar tech.  Tesla made the most progress until a fatal accident in 2016 . Before then, it was possible to drive for long periods of time without touching the steering wheel. An update now forces drivers to hand-check to make sure they are paying attention. (Tesla owners have figured out though that they can wedge an orange or a water bottle in the steering wheel to trick the system.)  (Credit: Cadillac)  With Super Cruise, the system goes well beyond the on-board sensors that keep you centered in your lane.  Cadillac mapped out 130,000 miles of highways in the US, but in order for the system to work, you must be on a road that has a barrier between lanes, is a four-lane highway, and entrance and exit ramps (usually with an overpass).  In our tests, we noticed Super Cruise would only activate after driving on a highway that meets those criteria after a minute or so, then disable itself a few minutes before we entered a stretch of road that didn\u2019t meet the criteria.  \u201cOne of the benefits of Super Cruise is to reduce driver fatigue during highway commutes \u2013 especially during heavy congestion on every day commuting and on long distance trips,\u201d says Daryl Wilson, the Lead Development Engineer for Super Cruise. \u201cSuper Cruise combines information from five cameras with a high-definition LIDAR-scanned map database and real-time corrected precision GPS to provide a robust path for the vehicle to follow.\u201d  (Credit: Cadillac)  During one test, a small gray icon appeared to the right of the main speedometer display indicating that Super Cruise was available.  We then pressed the Super Cruise button to activate it, and took our hands off the wheel. It\u2019s a slick, intelligent new technology that helped with the tedium of driving \u2013 you can relax a little more.  You still have to stay alert, but without your hands on the wheel, you can rest your arms and let the car drive itself.  The CT6 drove perfectly during each hands-free test, although there are a few things that are unique to the autonomous mode compared to driving a Tesla Model S.  One is that the lights on the steering wheel help you drive (or, rather, not drive). Green means Super Cruise is activated, red means there\u2019s a warning, and blue means it\u2019s paused.  If you want to change lanes, you activate the turn signal, then wait for the blue light to appear. This tells you that Super Cruise is pausing while you change lanes. Once you do, you wait for the light to glow blue so Super Cruise can resume. It takes some practice, honestly, but it makes sense why it works that way.  Secondly, Super Cruise is constantly monitoring whether you are paying attention; a camera points directly at you from the steering column.  In one drive, turning to look at a passenger for too long caused the system to deactivate. The lights started flashing, and we had to place our hands on the wheel after a few seconds.  In another test, turning to look to the side of the car caused the system to deactivate again. This time, the system flashed but, because we didn\u2019t grab the wheel, it locked the system and made Super Cruise unavailable. (To use it again, you have to pull over, turn the car off for a few seconds, then start the engine again.)  These precautions also make sense. It\u2019s a smart way to allow the driver to go hands-free for even several hours, monitoring attention level the whole time. And, it worked.  Other lane-keeping technologies, autonomous driving modes, and start and stop adaptive cruise systems sometimes feel wonky, as though a computer is in control.  Super Cruise feels natural. Some vehicles \u2013 like the Chrysler 200 \u2013 have somewhat similar tech, but the car feels like it\u2019s moving around and adjusting itself to stay in the lane. The CT6 stayed perfectly centered.  What\u2019s next from here? I imagine Cadillac will map out more highways and even release a patch at some point for two-lane highways and then, eventually, side streets and downtown areas.  A Cadillac representative did not confirm any other plans for additional Cadillac models to use Super Cruise, but autonomous driving will become more and more common.  Google's Waymo already uses autonomous minivans, and is picking up early riders with no driver behind the wheel. However, wider adoption of fully self-driving technology is still a ways off. For now, Super Cruise is a smart system that worked well during our entire testing period.", "stock": "TSLA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-14", "source": "techradar", "url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/testing-cadillac-super-cruise-is-this-the-future-of-hands-free-driving"}, {"article": "Image credit: Mercedes Benz  On the road to fully autonomous driving, there are a few milestones that give us some hope. Cars like the Volvo S90 that can adjust speed for the car in front of you on the highway and a Tesla Model S that can go hands-free for short periods have already set the bar.  This year, Cadillac challenged the Tesla throne with Super Cruise, a feature on the 2018 Cadillac CT6 that lets you drive without touching the steering wheel, even for several hours.  Another milestone? A feature on the 2018 Mercedes Benz E400 called Active Speed Limit Assist.  It\u2019s not brand new, and you can find it on other Mercedes models like the S-Class and several BMW models, but it\u2019s a sign of things to come \u2013 adaptive intelligence, machine learning, image recognition, and real-time mapping on major highways.  2018 Mercedes Benz E400 reads road signs and adjusts accordingly (Credit: Mercedes Benz)  As you drive, the E400 will adjust the speed you are driving to match the post limit. (You have to enable the feature in the main display; to activate, just use cruise control.)  It\u2019s an exciting innovation for a few reasons. One is that you don\u2019t have to think about the speed limit (say what you will at this point about going 5 mph over the limit, which many drivers feel is an acceptable risk).  You can pay attention to other things, like the sports-car on your bumper. Of course, you should always be aware of your speed.  More than anything, it shows how cars are becoming more aware of the roadway, the posted limits, and eventually could sense imminent dangers long before you see them yourself.  With Active Speed Limit Assist, it feels like an AI has taken over (Credit: Mercedes Benz)  In testing it, there\u2019s a feeling that an AI has taken over, one that adjusts automatically. On a four-lane highway, the E400 surged gently forward at times before we even realized the limit had changed.  This can help in situations where you are driving slowly and don\u2019t realize why everyone is looking at you. In one case, a jump from an area with stoplights with a speed limit of only 55 mph suddenly changed over to 70 mph.  Road awareness  Mercedes doesn\u2019t do the abrupt speed change common on other vehicles that finally have adaptive cruise control, like the 2018 Toyota Prius Prime . Instead, it\u2019s gradual.  During a longer test outside of a major city, there were times when we forgot the E400 was even changing speeds. It\u2019s easy to see how future cars will also read conditions like construction zones, icy pavement, an accident, and other problems reported either to traffic centers or that the car can identify.  Still, Active Speed Limit Assist isn\u2019t perfect. It worked for us only at normal highways speeds; in a traffic jam on a lonely country road with poor lane markings, it wasn\u2019t available.  Another specification to consider? The optional Premium 3 package adds $10,200 (about \u00a37,320 / AU$13,080) to the $58,900 (about \u00a342,274 / AU$75,538) base price.

From the wickedly powerful, 4K graphics-pumping GeForce GTX 1080 Ti to the entry-level GTX 1050 \u2013 and everything in between \u2013 Nvidia remains the crown ruler of the GPU world.  However, because gamers are always demanding the highest levels of graphical fidelity and tech companies and researchers both require greater GPU computation and AI functionality, the best graphics cards always need to become better and better. That\u2019s why Nvidia is hard at work developing the next generation GPU architecture, Nvidia Volta.  Nvidia actually has released two Volta cards already, back in 2017, but they were prohibitively expensive \u2013 as they were aimed at data scientists and professional artists \u2013 so, don\u2019t expect to see them in the best gaming PCs any time soon. Still, we\u2019re extremely eager to see what the next GeForce GTX cards will be, considering the massive performance leap we\u2019re expecting.  We thought we\u2019d get some information at Nvidia\u2019s GPU Technology Conference, but that proved to focus almost entirely on AI and autonomous car tech. We\u2019ll have to wait a little while longer for a GeForce announcement.  However, the way things are shaping up, we wouldn\u2019t expect to see Volta-powered GTX cards any time soon, as the architecture seems to be almost purely built around AI use-cases. And, even if Nvidia may be biding its time due to pricing and VRAM shortages, Turing is the architecture that we believe will be the real GeForce GTX 11 series.  Eager for an upgrade? Here's everything that we've heard so far.  Cut to the chase  What is it? Nvidia's next-gen, 12nm GPU line  Nvidia's next-gen, 12nm GPU line When is it out? The Tesla V100 and Titan V are out now, but GeForce cards are TBD  The Tesla V100 and Titan V are out now, but GeForce cards are TBD What will it cost? TBD  As mentioned, Nvidia's Volta architecture is already on the market, albeit not in any form that you're likely to slide into your gaming PC. The Tesla V100 was first out the gate in May 2017, as a professional-level GPU built to empower artificial intelligence applications and help run data centers. It's not a consumer-level device by any stretch of the imagination.    On the other hand, the Nvidia Titan V \u2013 released in December 2017 \u2013 is considered a consumer device, but you might scoff at the $2,999 (about \u00a32149, AU$3800) price point. The Titan V is targeted towards researchers and other high-performance computing needs rather than making PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds look pretty.    But if you are looking for a new graphics card, will you be able to buy a fresh, top-of-the-line GeForce GTX 1180 soon? Honestly, we're not sure. The GTX 10-series line was announced back in May 2016 and began rolling out that month, so we're nearing the two-year mark since Nvidia's Pascal-powered cards first released. But they're still selling like crazy, especially with the current cryptocurrency craze leading to gouged prices and scarce availability.    Furthermore, Nvidia head Jensen Huang suggested last August that it's still too costly to produce consumer-level gaming graphics cards at reasonable prices. Given that we didn't see any GeForce announcements at CES 2018 in January, and since the Titan V just recently rolled out at that eye-popping price, it seems entirely possible that Nvidia isn't going to rush out Volta-powered gaming GPUs anytime soon.    We expect to see them in 2018, but our original expectation of a spring debut doesn't seem terribly firm, and there aren't enough solid rumors or leaks to point to at this time.  Nvidia Volta price  Without a roadmap for releases, we can't say for sure what to expect from pricing for Volta-powered GeForce GTX graphics cards. The Titan V's pumped-up pricing shouldn't scare you, as the card was never intended for gamers. On the other hand, if Volta-powered GPUs were still too pricey to produce for graphics cards a few months ago, how long will it take until they hit a point where Nvidia deems them worth selling?  Until then, we can look back at the base price points for the current 10-series line, although you might find much higher prices due to the cryptocurrency boom.  We'll have to wait and see whether Nvidia releases a similar range of Volta-based cards, as well as whether they'll see any significant price increase from the 10-series starting points.  Given that the prices of Nvidia Pascal graphics cards came at a slightly higher premium \u2013 coinciding with the increased performance \u2013 over the Maxwell cards they replaced, we can imagine that these 11-series parts could be more expensive.  Nvidia Volta specs  Volta introduces a new 12-nanometer manufacturing process, which marks a significant step up from the 16nm process seen with the Pascal GPUs.  What exactly does that mean?  Well, it means that Nvidia's manufacturing partner TSMC can jam a whole lot more transistors into a comparable amount of space, thus yielding a massive surge in computing ability. You'll get better performance, not to mention significant power savings.  The Titan V packs in 21.1 billion transistors, which collectively provide a stunning 110 teraflops of computing power. New tensor cores are designed to speed up deep learning ability, with nine times more peak computing teraflops over the previous Titan Xp card. And it's twice as energy-efficient too.  Additionally, the Titan V has six graphics processing clusters with 5,120 CUDA cores (up from 3,840 in the Titan Xp) and 320 texture units, and a base clock of 1200MHz that can boost up to 1455MHz. With 12GB HBM2 memory onboard, the Titan V boasts a memory bandwidth of 652.8GB/sec.  The last bit on the specs side is surprising from Nvidia, whom just the last year championed the enhanced speed of GDDR5X memory on its high-end GPUs.  The Nvidia Titan V is the first mainline card to feature high-bandwidth memory outside of the company\u2019s Quadro and Tesla parts. Whether this means HBM2 will be a mainstay of Volta remains to be seen.  All told, it's a potentially enormous upgrade over the last generation of Nvidia cards.  But let's step back for a moment, because all we can do right now is compare a $2,999 graphics card to the $1,200 card that came before it\u2014and neither of those figures gives us a whole lot of insight into what we'll actually see from the cheaper GeForce cards that ultimately come our way. We'll likely get scaled-down versions of the Nvidia Titan V at lower prices, so they may not hit the same kinds of peaks as their progenitor is capable of.  Even so, however, the promise of dramatically increased performance on the top end suggests that we'll see similar kinds of improvements at the more approachable price points. And if so, then the GTX 11-series really should provide dramatic boosts in graphical output. On the high end, we should get 4K gaming nearer to the sweet spot of 60 frames per second, while cheaper versions should be more capable of smooth VR performance and strongly support resolutions in excess of 1080p.  Until Nvidia releases a roadmap for its GeForce GTX offerings and hints at what form those cards will take, we're still spit-balling for now.  But based on these initial pro-level renditions, Volta seems capable of so much more than the previous Pascal-powered GPUs \u2013 and even if those are plenty powerful today, Volta appears poised to elevate PC gaming to previously unseen levels.

The driver had received several visual and one audible hands-on warning earlier in the drive and the driver's hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds prior to the collision. The driver had about five seconds and 150 meters of unobstructed view of the concrete divider with the crushed crash attenuator, but the vehicle logs show that no action was taken.  It reiterated a statement from its first update, noting that a crash attenuator safety barrier intended to mitigate the effect of a collision in that spot was missing due to an earlier crash. While it noted that the driver had time and unobstructed view of the divider before the crash, it didn't mention what action the automated systems took at the time. The driver's brother told a reporter that Huang had previously complained the car would swivel toward that exact barrier and had complained to the Tesla dealership about it, but that they could not replicate the issue.  Tesla also went on to cite stats from the government showing Autopilot reduced crash rates by 40 percent, and suffered far fewer fatalities per mile than other cars.  In the US, there is one automotive fatality every 86 million miles across all vehicles from all manufacturers. For Tesla, there is one fatality, including known pedestrian fatalities, every 320 million miles in vehicles equipped with Autopilot hardware. If you are driving a Tesla equipped with Autopilot hardware, you are 3.7 times less likely to be involved in a fatal accident. Tesla Autopilot does not prevent all accidents \u2013 such a standard would be impossible \u2013 but it makes them much less likely to occur. It unequivocally makes the world safer for the vehicle occupants, pedestrians and cyclists. No one knows about the accidents that didn't happen, only the ones that did. The consequences of the public not using Autopilot, because of an inaccurate belief that it is less safe, would be extremely severe. There are about 1.25 million automotive deaths worldwide. If the current safety level of a Tesla vehicle were to be applied, it would mean about 900,000 lives saved per year. We expect the safety level of autonomous cars to be 10 times safer than non-autonomous cars.  The National Transportation Safety Board already said it's investigating the crash, to look at the fire and steps to make the car safe for removal from the scene. However, Bloomberg reported that it's also looking into another crash earlier this year where a Model S ran into a fire truck parked on the highway, where the driver claimed Autopilot was engaged at the time. In 2016 a driver blamed Autopilot for a crash on the Pennsylvania Turnpike, but the company said data showed the feature was not in use at the time. And last year the NTSB found fault with both driver and technology in the case of a fatal Florida crash.  For autonomous or driver assist technology, the scrutiny is raised not only because of those incidents, but also the recent self-driving Uber crash in Arizona.

Judging by its pre-orders (the highest the industry has seen), it's already the most anticipated car ever. It's the culmination of CEO Elon Musk's nearly 12-year-old \"master plan\" to bring an affordable EV to market. Now that the Model 3 is here I can positively say it's a joy to drive, but it's also frustrating to do some of the simplest things in the cockpit. During a single trip I went from having an electric-motor-fueled grin on my face to throwing my hands up in exasperation while trying to adjust the cruise control follow distance. So yeah, it's complicated.  The relationship (and if you follow any Tesla forums or even hang out at a Supercharger station, you know the owners are in a relationship with their cars) starts out like all new affairs: filled with excitement. Behind the wheel, the Model 3 is the best Tesla. I prefer it to the Model S (yes, even the P100D) as well as the Model X. It's quick but more importantly nimble. It handles corners and is far lighter on its tires than the S or X. It doesn't have the neck-snapping speed of Ludicrous mode, but the Long Range version's 307 pounds of torque coupled with 271 horsepower make for a car that's just asking the driver to punch the accelerator and hit a few curves.  The Model 3 also has a very smooth and nearly silent ride. It's quieter than most other EVs, and it glides almost as well as a mid-tier luxury sedan. With a range of 220 miles for the base model and 310 for the Long Range edition, you're going to be spending a good amount of time behind the wheel instead of sitting at a Supercharger.  Yet no matter how engrossed you are in the act of driving, the interior of the Model 3 will probably manage to confound you at some point. Some things are just too complex.  The act of driving is more than just pressing the accelerator and pointing a car toward its destination. While you're on the road you turn things on and off and adjust various settings. At any given moment, I was changing the temperature or the volume of the radio, adjusting mirrors, using navigation, fine-tuning cruise control and sometimes even adjusting my chair. It's a dynamic experience. As you'll quickly find out, Tesla has moved some of these controls to submenus on the Model 3's giant 15-inch display.  To be clear, there are hardware controls in the car, including two buttons on the steering wheel and two stalks on the steering column. The right stalk controls the transmission and turns autopilot on and off. The left stalk is the blinker control and is used for a single wipe and cleaning the windshield. The buttons are programmable by Tesla, but the left one is mostly for controlling your media. But that's it, and the hardware situation (or lack thereof) creates a bunch of issues pertaining to usability.  The first time I noticed this I was using Tesla's semiautonomous Autopilot feature. The controls for adjusting the top speed and follow distance of adaptive cruise control are on the wheel and steering stalk on the Model S and X. They're easy to adjust without looking. On the Model 3 you have to tap the display to adjust the cruise control speed. Even worse, you have to go into a submenu to adjust the adaptive cruise control follow distance. First you tap on the car icon, then find and tap on Autopilot in the screen that pops up. Finally, you adjust the follow distance by tapping plus or minus. That's not even close to a better experience, and it's potentially dangerous, because instead of using muscle memory to find and adjust a physical item, you're reaching and tapping while looking to the right.  Plus, a few times instead of tapping Autopilot, I hit something else because of a bump. That's an ongoing issue with in-car touchscreens that every automaker should be aware of. But it didn't stop Tesla from making that display the car's primary input device.  Adjusting the mirrors also requires a few taps before they become adjustable via the two steering wheel buttons. Typically these are fixed before you start driving, so it's not that bad. But the wipers, that's a different story.  As noted earlier, you can enable a single swipe or a cleaning of the windshield via the left stalk. But anything beyond that requires using the touchscreen. The Model 3 does have automatic wipers, which work well most of the time. During a rainstorm, however, it took longer than I was comfortable with to engage and didn't wipe fast enough for my liking. To speed them up, I had to reach over and tap the speed I wanted.  If this were any other car or automaker, that would be it. I'd tell you that these usability issues make an otherwise amazing car a pain to drive. But Tesla's cars evolve while sitting in your driveway, and apparently, it's already working on these issues.  The ability to adjust the adaptive cruise control speed is coming to the right hardware button on the steering wheel. The wipers are also getting an update that puts a shortcut to start them on the left stalk. Both of these will arrive in the form of over-the-air updates. No word on whether the adaptive cruise control follow distance will also receive hardware-button support.  This is where the company shines: the ability to take feedback from owners and reviewers like myself and fix things with a software update. But I can't review a car based on what it'll do in the future. I have to make my assessment based on what's available now. And right now, I'm bewildered as to why these decisions were made in the first place.  I'm also annoyed by the lack of a dash cluster behind the steering wheel. The display that was in front of the driver on the Model S and X has been relocated to the left side of the touchscreen display. So you're looking to the right not only to see your speed but also what gear you're in and what the sensors see (which is especially important while parking) as well as to check on blinkers. It's weird for the left blinker to be flashing in your right eye.  The lack of a display ahead of the driver is even more noticeable at night. After decades of having something glowing behind the steering wheel, complete darkness from that part of the car is eerie.  Tesla isn't the first automaker to move the speedometer to the center of the dash. Mini did it decades ago. In fact, I own a Mini with the speedo in the middle of dash. I hate it. I'm not a fan. It wasn't enough to dissuade me from buying and enjoying my car. But it's something to keep in mind when you're thinking about the Model 3.  These are dramatic changes from the Model S and X. Thankfully, though, some things do carry over from those two vehicles. Even though this is the affordable Tesla (its starting price is less than half the price of the base model Model S), if you plunk down $5,000 for the Autopilot option, you're getting the same experience as the other models. Tesla continues to refine its semiautonomous system, which is one of the best in the industry. The Model 3 had very few problems staying centered in its lane and tracking cars. The auto-lane-change option felt a bit more aggressive than the last time I drove a Tesla. Most of the time it was fine, but in one instance it quickly changed lanes, then immediately started braking enough to catch everyone in the car and the vehicle behind me off guard. It's a reminder that none of these systems are ready to be left on their own.  Another place where the Tesla excels is its voice control. Even when I flubbed the names of locations, it figured out what I was trying to say. \"Umpire State Building\" was quickly changed to \"Empire State Building\" based on context. It did an outstanding job handling building numbers and parsing the names of friends I wanted to call. Currently, the feature controls navigation, the phone and media playback. But Musk said on Twitter that in the future, voice control would be integrated more into the vehicle's control, which is great news. But it'll be better when that actually happens.  Definitely. You will be able to do pretty much anything via voice command. Software team is focused on core Model 3 functionality right now, but that will be done soon, then we will add a lot more features. \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) Jan. 15th, 2018  In short, there's a lot coming to the Model 3 -- eventually.  That's what's so infuriating, because being behind the wheel of the Model 3 puts a smile on my face. It delivers on so many levels, and yet when I have to do things that would be simple in any other car, here it involves tapping and swiping when I should be looking at the road. That's frustrating. If this were a horrible car, it would be fine: You chalk it up to an overall failure of the automaker. A bad vehicle is a bad vehicle. But it's not. It's a great car held back by weird decisions. Tesla says it's working on these issues. That's great, but I can't judge a car I haven't driven yet.  So I have to caveat the hell out of this car. It's great on the road and the tech is top notch, but using some of the most important features are a pain and potentially dangerous to operate. The plus side (but not really) is that if you order the car today it'll be 12 to 18 months before it's delivered. By then, hopefully, Tesla will have a user interface that's worthy of a car as great as the Model 3. Because right now, it's complicated.", "stock": "TSLA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-01", "source": "engadget", "url": "https://www.engadget.com/2018/03/01/tesla-model-3-review/"}, {"article": "Attendees at the Bucharest Auto Show in Bucharest, Romania, studied a privately owned Tesla Inc. Model S electric vehicle on display in October 2016. On Thursday, the auto maker said it was recalling about 123,000 Model S sedans over a potential bolt issue. Photo: Vadim Ghirda/Associated Press  Tesla Inc. TSLA 2.13% is voluntarily recalling about 123,000 Model S sedans globally after discovering that certain corroding bolts in cold weather climates could lead to a power-steering failure.  The Silicon Valley auto maker on Thursday said the recall, believed to be the company\u2019s largest ever, applies to Model S sedans built before April 2016. Tesla said the issue is known to have involved less than 0.02% of the potentially affected vehicles in the U.S.  Tesla has sold about 280,000 total vehicles through the end of last year.  \u201cThere have been no injuries or accidents due to this component, despite accumulating more than a billion miles of driving,\u201d according to an email being sent to customers by Tesla. The recall to retrofit the power steering component adds to the string of challenges Chief Executive Elon Musk is dealing with as he tries to boost production of the Tesla\u2019s mass-market Model 3 sedan and conserve the company\u2019s cash supply. Moody\u2019s Investors Service this week downgraded Tesla\u2019s credit rating, concerned that the company won\u2019t meet its first-quarter goal of making 2,500 Model 3s a week. The milestone is important because further delays could crimp Tesla\u2019s cash and threaten to derail Tesla\u2019s bid to build electric cars for the masses. The downgrade, along with news this week that federal investigators were probing a fatal crash of a Tesla car, have led to a heavy selloff of the company\u2019s shares and bonds, making it potentially more difficult to raise capital. On Thursday, Tesla\u2019s stock rose 3.2%, to $266.13, during the regular trading session, and fell slightly in after-hours trading following the recall news. It has been a rough month for the stock, which has fallen about 20% over the 30-day period. Tesla is expected to reveal first-quarter production results early next week. The recall on Thursday only involves the Model S. Tesla said its service center in Montreal began noticing the issue in Model S sedans and attributed the corrosion to the calcium or magnesium salts used to treat roadways during the winter months. If the bolts fail, the car can still be steered but requires additional force. \u201cThis primarily makes the car harder to drive at low speeds and for parallel parking, but does not materially affect control at high speed, where only small steering wheel force is needed,\u201d the company said. The cost of the recall is expected to be minimal, Tesla said, with the supplier paying for the new part.

TSLA 2.13% said it updated the pay package for Chief Executive Elon Musk with a plan that again ties his compensation entirely to key performance benchmarks\u2014albeit this time much larger ones, including an ultimate goal to hit $650 billion in market value.  The pay plan, which shareholders must still approve, is designed to keep Mr. Musk as Tesla\u2019s top leader for years to come\u2014although allows for the prospect that he might evolve away from the day-to-day role of CEO into one of executive chairman and chief product officer.  The plan, which is modeled on an earlier program set for Mr. Musk in 2012, entails a 10-year grant of stock options that would vest in 12 tranches. Each would vest only if a set of two milestones are achieved, one based on market value, the other on a measure of revenue or profit. For each tranche achieved, Mr. Musk would receive shares equal to 1% of the company\u2019s total shares outstanding as of Jan. 21, 2018.  For example, the first tranche would vest if Tesla hits $100 billion in market value and $20 billion in revenue or $1.5 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, after adjusting for stock compensation. For all 12 tranches to vest, Tesla\u2019s market value would have to reach $650 billion.  Tesla, which reported revenue of $7 billion for 2016, had a market value of about $58.8 billion as of Monday\u2019s close. Mr. Musk owns about 20% of the company, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.  \u201cThis ensures that Elon will continue to lead Tesla\u2019s management over the long-term while also providing the flexibility to bring in another CEO who would report to Elon at some point in the future,\u201d Tesla said in a statement about the plan released around 12:30 a.m. on Tuesday in California. \u201cAlthough there is no current intention for this to happen, it provides the flexibility as Tesla continues to grow to potentially allow Elon to focus more of his attention on the kinds of key product and strategic matters that most impact Tesla\u2019s long-term growth and profitability.\u201d  Tesla said that if none of the tranches are achieved, Mr. Musk wouldn\u2019t receive any compensation. That would put him in similar territory to some other prominent Silicon Valley leaders who own enormously valuable stakes in their companies but receive little or no salary.  Mr. Musk\u2019s previous compensation program, granted in 2012, targeted a market value of $43.2 billion along with meeting certain milestones by 2022. It required him to remain as CEO.  Since Tesla overtook Ford Motor Co.\u2019s market value last year, and flirted with that of General Motors Co. , the Silicon Valley auto maker\u2019s valuation has been a continual point of conversation. Critics question why investors are betting so much on a company that has yet to turn an annual profit and that has delivered a fraction of the sales of much larger competitors.  Fans say they are betting on Mr. Musk\u2019s vision for personal transportation that includes electric cars that drive themselves and are powered off the company\u2019s solar panels and charged from its storage batteries.  Investor enthusiasm fueled Tesla\u2019s growth last year, even as Mr. Musk struggled to ramp up production of the Model 3 sedan, which is testing his ability to evolve the company into a more mainstream auto maker from one of a luxury niche player.  Mr. Musk has previously outlined a way for the company to reach a market cap of $700 billion, something he reiterated last year.  \u201cI could be completely delusional but I think I see a clear path to that outcome,\u201d he told analysts in May.  Mr. Musk, who also heads other companies including Space Exploration Technologies Corp., or SpaceX, has hinted that he might want to change his role at Tesla.  In May, an analyst asked Mr. Musk if he still intended to step away from Tesla after bringing out the Model 3, as he had previously suggested.  \u201cI intend to be actively involved with Tesla for the rest of my life,\u201d Mr. Musk said. \u201cHopefully, stopping before I get too old\u2014or too crazy, I don\u2019t know. But that doesn\u2019t mean I should be CEO forever.\u201d He suggested a role contributing in \u201cproduct design and technology.\u201d  Write to Tim Higgins at Tim.Higgins@WSJ.com", "stock": "TSLA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-01-23", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-gives-musk-new-long-term-pay-deal-tied-to-big-targets-1516704840?mod=searchresults&amp;page=1&amp;pos=2"}, {"article": "Tesla Inc. is expected to release fourth-quarter financial results after the market closes Wednesday. Here\u2019s what you need to know:  EARNINGS FORECAST: Tesla is expected to post an adjusted loss of $3.15 a share, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet, compared with an adjusted 69 cent-a-share loss a year earlier. Adjusted results exclude stock-based and acquisition costs, and other items.  REVENUE FORECAST: Revenue is expected to rise to $3.29 billion, according to FactSet, from $2.28 billion a year earlier. Tesla has said deliveries of the Model X sport-utility vehicle, Model S sedan and new Model 3 sedan totaled 29,870 during the quarter, up 35% from a year ago. The company delivered 1,550 units of the Model 3, which began production in July.  WHAT TO WATCH:  PRODUCTION HELL: \u201cWe believe an update on the Model 3 production ramp will be the first question on many investors\u2019 minds,\u201d James Albertine, an analyst for Consumer Edge Research, said in a note to investors. Investors have watched Tesla fall months behind in its production goals after running into bottlenecks at its Fremont, Calif., assembly factory and Nevada battery plant. Chief Executive Elon Musk once had predicted reaching a rate of production of 5,000 Model 3 vehicles a week by the end of the last year\u2019s fourth quarter\u2014a prediction that had already fallen from 20,000 in December and, at one point, as many as 200,000 in the second half of 2017. Tesla ended up making 2,425 Model 3s in the fourth quarter, the company reported in January as it pushed back the goal of reaching 5,000 a week until the end of June.  CASH BURN: Mr. Musk has long said the ramp-up of the Model 3, a sedan with a $35,000 price tag aimed at making Tesla vehicles more accessible, would generate the cash needed to fund the company\u2019s expansion. The sedan\u2019s delays put that vision at risk. Tesla began the final three months of 2017 with $3.5 billion on hand and planned to spend $1 billion during the period on capital expenditures. Earlier this month, the company raised about $550 million from bonds. Tesla executives have said they need a minimum of $1 billion each quarter for working capital. Colin Langan, an analyst for UBS, estimates Tesla can generate about $1 billion in working capital once it produces 5,000 Model 3s a week. Even so, he and others expect Tesla will need to raise additional money.  WHAT\u2019S NEXT: In recent months, Mr. Musk has generated attention talking about plans for new vehicles\u2014a two-door Roadster sports car, commercial truck and compact SUV\u2014as well as new factories in Europe and China. All would cost billions of dollars. In November, he and Chief Financial Officer Deepak Ahuja hinted at internal discussions about whether Tesla needed to back away from some of its growth plans to rein in spending. Investors are anxious for clarity about the evolving strategy. Excitement over the new products may already be helping Mr. Musk\u2019s cash situation. Deposits in the fourth quarter for the new commercial truck and the sports car, as well as a sell-down in Model S and Model X inventory, may have boosted Tesla\u2019s working capital by $700 million, according to Mr. Langan\u2019s estimates.

Photo: SpaceX/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images  Tesla is literally flying high after Elon Musk\u2019s successful rocket launch, which blasted a vehicle into outer space. Fourth-quarter earnings out Wednesday, however, still point to a number of challenges back here on Earth.  Tesla reported fourth-quarter revenue of $3.3 billion and an adjusted loss of $3.04 a share. That just beat the analyst consensus loss of $3.11. But a year ago, the consensus for the fourth quarter was a loss of 17 cents a share.  There were bright spots besides the earnings. Tesla burned just $277 million in free cash, a significant improvement from recent quarters. And the company managed to avoid lowering its Model 3 production forecast for a third time in three months. The cash burn appeared lower because Tesla included customer deposits for its planned new truck and roadster in its operating cash flow. That is deceiving because these deposits aren\u2019t drawn from current operations.  Meanwhile, an alarming trend of negative operating leverage has yet to reverse itself\u2014the more cars it sells the worse its margins become. Automotive gross margin fell to 13.8%, down more than 8 percentage points from a year earlier. That trend isn\u2019t likely to meaningfully reverse any time soon. Tesla forecasts about 100,000 deliveries of its older Model S and X vehicles this year, which offer better profits than the Model 3. That won\u2019t offer much, if any, growth from the 2017 tally of 101,000 cars.  The Model 3 is supposed to carry prices up to 65% below Tesla\u2019s average selling price on older products; there will have to be substantial cost-cutting and improvements in production efficiency to even hold margins constant. Meanwhile, new industry competition coming this year won\u2019t improve pricing power.  Granted, investor faith in Mr. Musk is as strong as ever, and Tesla still enjoys open access to capital markets. Fears of a crash in the stock price aren\u2019t likely to materialize anytime soon.  However, Tesla\u2019s chances of becoming a sustainable business that doesn\u2019t need constant capital markets access to survive seems less likely than a sports car in orbit.

Emergency personnel work at the scene where a Tesla vehicle crashed in Mountain View, Calif. on March 23. Tesla on Wednesday said the driver of the car was to blame, while his family said they were exploring legal options following the fatal accident. Photo: /Associated Press  Tesla Inc. TSLA 2.13% defended its semiautonomous Autopilot system in the wake of a fatal crash last month, blaming the incident on the driver after his family hired a lawyer to explore legal options.  Walter Huang died on March 23 after the Model X sport-utility vehicle he was driving southbound on Highway 101 near Mountain View, Calif., collided with a barrier and was struck by two other vehicles. The auto maker a week later said that the SUV\u2019s Autopilot was activated in the moments leading up to the crash and that the driver\u2019s hands weren\u2019t detected on the wheel for six seconds before the crash.  On Wednesday, Tesla more explicitly assigned blame to the driver. \u201cThe crash happened on a clear day with several hundred feet of visibility ahead, which means that the only way for this accident to have occurred is if Mr. Huang wasn\u2019t paying attention to the road, despite the car providing multiple warnings to do so,\u201d a Tesla spokesman said in a statement.  Earlier on Wednesday, San Francisco-based Minami Tamaki LLP announced in a statement that the family had retained its services and plans to file a wrongful-death lawsuit. The family appeared on local television on Tuesday night defending Mr. Huang\u2019s driving.  \u201cThe firm believes Tesla\u2019s Autopilot feature is defective and likely caused Huang\u2019s death, despite Tesla\u2019s apparent attempt to blame the victim of this terrible tragedy,\u201d the law firm said in a statement.  Investigators for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board are probing the crash. On April 1, the NTSB said it was unhappy with Tesla for releasing detailed information about the crash.  NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt and Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk had a recent discussion that appeared to defuse the tension. \u201cChairman Sumwalt had what he described as a very constructive conversation with Mr. Musk over the weekend,\u201d a spokesman for the NTSB said. \u201cThey discussed the investigation of the March 23 Tesla crash, NTSB investigative processes, and Tesla\u2019s work to address the safety recommendations that were issued last year as a result of the May 2016 Tesla crash in Williston, Florida.\u201d \u200bThe latter was a reference to a fatal crash involving Autopilot for which the NTSB determined Tesla shared blame.  Tesla declined to comment on the discussion.  The NTSB declined to comment\u200b on Tesla\u2019s defense of its technology in the most recent fatal crash, while NHTSA had no immediate comment.\u200bSeparately, the NTSB spokesman said the agency was investigating a battery fire linked to a Tesla Model X SUV that crashed into a garage in Lake Forest, Calif., in August 2017. The NTSB is primarily interested in the battery fire in that incident, the spokesman said. Tesla declined to comment on the battery-fire probe.  Tesla\u2019s Wednesday statement intensified its defense of semiautonomous technology amid greater scrutiny of whether humans can remain alert while using these systems. Auto makers are rolling out partially automated systems that pass control back and forth between vehicle and driver, some with technology designed to keep the driver alert, such as eye-tracking technology. Others, like Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Waymo, believe there should be no need for a human to take control in driving situations.  Autopilot, which is a collection of \u201cdriver assistance features,\u201d isn\u2019t a self-driving system. Tesla tells users in its owner\u2019s manual and in-vehicle display warnings that users need to remain alert and maintain control of the vehicle.  \u201cWe empathize with Mr. Huang\u2019s family, who are understandably facing loss and grief, but the false impression that Autopilot is unsafe will cause harm to others on the road,\u201d Tesla said Wednesday. \u201cThe reason that other families are not on TV is because their loved ones are still alive.\u201d  Tesla had said earlier that the driver took no action despite having five seconds and about 500 feet of unobstructed view of the concrete highway divider.  The 2016 fatal crash in Florida put Tesla\u2019s technology into the spotlight. The NTSB said Tesla shared partial blame for the crash, noting Autopilot allowed the driver to go long periods without his hands on the wheel and ignore the company\u2019s warnings. NHTSA, however, said the system wasn\u2019t defective and that Tesla vehicles\u2019 crash rate dropped by almost 40% after the auto-steer feature was installed. The vehicle in the 2016 accident was equipped with the auto-steer feature.  After the NTSB findings in the 2016 crash, Tesla said it would continue to be clear with current and potential customers that Autopilot doesn\u2019t render vehicles fully self-driving and that motorists must always remain attentive.

Residential solar had been on a tear, averaging 49% annual growth between 2010 and 2016, but the number of megawatts added last year dropped by 16% compared with the year before, according to new data from GTM Research, a firm that tracks renewable energy. It was the first annual decline since at least 2000, which is as far back as GTM tracks figures.  Industry executives and energy experts said the slowdown was driven by a sharp retreat by national solar installers, including Tesla\u2019s SolarCity and Vivint Solar Inc. VSLR -2.44% Those big outfits had deployed large sales forces to pitch homeowners on the benefits of rooftop solar, and heavily marketed deals to lease panels that required little to no money down.  The race to build a dominant national solar brand led companies to burn through cash. Unable to maintain that pace, companies scaled back and focused on profits over growth, or in some cases, got out of the rooftop solar business altogether.  SolarCity, purchased by Tesla in 2016, posted the largest declines. Once the clear-cut leader among solar installers, with one-third of the national market two years ago, it ended door-to-door sales last year and cut customer-acquisition spending. Its sales, as measured by megawatts deployed, fell by 38% in 2017, according to company figures, which include both residential and commercial installations.  Tesla said it was moving away from no-money-down leases and toward sales. It appears to have been passed by rival Sunrun Inc. RUN 0.35% in recent months as the top solar installer in the country, according to GTM.  \u201cWe expect growth to resume later this year,\u201d Tesla said last month.  Other companies also retreated from heavily marketing their home solar businesses, including NRG Energy Inc., NRG 0.37% which shut its business last year, and Vivint, which posted a 17% drop in residential sales volume in 2017 as it moved to prioritize profitability. Sungevity Inc. filed for bankruptcy protection last year after an aggressive growth strategy resulted in too much debt, the company said in a court filing.  The industry\u2019s sales strategies have attracted scrutiny by regulators in some states, including New Mexico, where the state attorney general, Hector Balderas, filed a lawsuit last month claiming that Vivint used \u201cfalse, misleading and fraudulent statements\u201d to sign customers up for long-term deals.  Rob Kain, Vivint\u2019s vice president of investor relations, said the company disagrees with the allegations and plans to contest them in court.  \u201cCould we have had a salesperson who was aggressive? I wouldn\u2019t be surprised,\u201d Mr. Kain said, adding that the company would have fired a salesperson for misrepresentations.  SolarCity grew with help from a hard-charging sales culture. Before being acquired by Tesla, the company, which was run by Lyndon Rive, the cousin of Tesla founder Elon Musk, tapped salespeople from the mortgage industry and Las Vegas casinos to sell solar panels, and gave them aggressive quotas, according to current and former managers and employees interviewed by The Wall Street Journal.  Last year, Tesla changed course and began selling solar panels through the same stores that sell its cars. Other sales approaches were shut down in order to \u201cfocus on projects with better margins,\u201d the company said.  Eric White, president and chief executive of Dividend Finance , a San Francisco-based company that provides loans to homeowners putting solar on their roofs, said many solar companies acted too much like Silicon Valley firms, pursuing growth at all costs in hopes of becoming leaders in a nascent market.  Mr. White said that while the industry\u2019s prior growth is \u201cnot sustainable and leaves bodies in its tracks,\u201d 5%-to-15% annual increases are achievable.  Solar energy grew rapidly in recent years as the cost of solar panels declined. The all-in cost of a typical rooftop solar system fell by 61% between 2010 and 2017 to $2.80 per watt, or roughly $16,000 for the average home system, according to the federal government.  Solar executives and industry analysts believe annual residential solar growth will resume in 2018. But two developments risk hurting sales in coming years, say industry analysts. First, new Trump administration tariffs on imported solar modules, mostly from China, are expected to marginally raise costs. Second, a federal government tax incentive to homeowners worth 30% of the value of the solar array is set to end by 2021.  Lynn Jurich, chief executive of Sunrun, said rising utility electricity rates and falling solar panel costs will drive increased interest in solar.  \u201cWe saw an unnaturally high growth rate because there was a lot of capital coming in to spend on advertising and customer origination, and not a lot of discipline on focusing on profitable growth,\u201d she said of the sector as a whole. \u201cYou suck all the advertising out of an industry and it shrinks.\u201d  Still, companies continue to spend considerable amounts acquiring customers. Sunrun estimates it spends about 28 cents on marketing for every dollar spent on purchasing and installing panels.  Sophie Karp, an analyst at Guggenheim Securities, said industrywide customer-acquisition costs were higher.  \u201cSolar is not a product that you buy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a product that gets sold.\u201d  \u2014Kirsten Grind contributed to this article.

That\u2019s well above the level it should have been if production ramped up more gradually during the quarter, as Tesla had predicted it would in January.", "stock": "TSLA", "label": 1, "date": "2018-04-04", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-quarter-end-tesla-suddenly-got-busy-1522876356"}, {"article": "A small Tesla Inc. TSLA 2.13% contractor has sued the auto maker claiming it hasn\u2019t been paid for work at a Fremont, Calif., assembly plant where Tesla is now trying to ramp up production of the Model 3 sedan.  American Integrated Services Inc. claims Tesla hasn\u2019t paid $513,473 for lead and asbestos abatement-related work under a $3.57 million contract signed in January 2016. It filed the lawsuit Tuesday in a California state court in Oakland.  Tesla called the matter \u201ca minor commercial dispute.\u201d  \u201cWe paid AIS for all the work we authorized them to do,\u201d a Tesla spokesman said in a statement Friday. \u201cThe additional payment they\u2019re seeking is for work that we did not authorize and that clearly was unnecessary. When we asked for documentation showing that Tesla had authorized this unnecessary work, they were unable to provide it.\u201d  The claim comes as the auto maker faces questions about its cash level while it spends heavily to ramp up production of the Model 3, a compact sedan that is designed to turn the electric-car maker from a niche player to one that sells to the masses.  Large automotive suppliers are generally loath to file claims against car makers and can often carry unpaid bills while its customer works to improve its situation, betting there will be future business to win. Small companies, however, can\u2019t always make that bet, or aren\u2019t willing to do so, especially if they don\u2019t expect to do further business with the car company.  Dennis Virag, a manufacturing consultant who has worked in the automotive industry for 40 years, said auto makers generally try to pay vendors quickly unless there is a dispute about the quality or fulfillment of a contract.  The lawsuit claims the contractor had an agreement to be paid within 30 days of receipt of invoices.  \u201cTesla purchased furnishing lead and asbestos abatement, demolition and removal and other environmental and remediation services, goods, materials, labor, supplies and equipment from on or about Feb. 19, 2017, to present,\u201d the lawsuit said.  A lawyer for American Integrated Services declined to comment, citing ongoing litigation.  Production of the Model 3 began last July and has failed to reach multiple milestones set by Tesla, including one last quarter to make as many as 2,500 sedans in a single week. Tesla on Tuesday worked to reassure investors about its capital needs for the year, saying it was on track to ramp production to around 5,000 Model 3 cars a week in about three months and that would lay the ground work for \u201cstrong positive operating cash flow\u201d in the third quarter.  \u201cAs a result, Tesla does not require an equity or debt raise this year, apart from standard credit lines,\u201d the company said in the quarterly sales report.  That update followed an April Fools\u2019 Day Twitter post by Chief Executive Elon Musk that joked the company had gone bankrupt and a report from Moody\u2019s Investors Service last week downgrading Tesla\u2019s credit rating, concerned about the company\u2019s cash levels and production delays.  The company finished last year with $3.4 billion in cash on hand after its negative cash flow averaged about $1 billion a quarter on average\u2014a pace analysts have said means the company would need to raise more money this year unless it significantly boosts production.  Tesla has more than $10 billion in debt and its accounts payable has swelled to $2.39 billion at the end of the year from $1.86 billion a year earlier.  Following Tuesday\u2019s assurance that Tesla doesn\u2019t need to raise money, several analysts said they expect the company will do so later this year. Brian Johnson, an analyst for Barclays, wrote in a note to investors that he expected Tesla would need to raise $2.5 billion in the third quarter.  \u2014Andrew Scurria and Lisa Schwartz contributed to this article.

Future cooperation could extend beyond France. A source familiar with the talks said on Tuesday that Amazon and Casino were negotiating a deal in Brazil either partnering or selling Casino\u2019s local appliance and electronics chain Via Varejo SA (VVAR3.SA).  Casino said the process of selling Via Varejo was continuing in Brazil with no new element to report and there was no partnership.  The French move, which is set to shake up the competitive local food retail market, lifted Casino shares as much as 9.7 percent in morning trade amid speculation that it could lead to a bigger deal later on.  Amazon\u2019s purchase of the bricks-and-mortar retailer Whole Foods Market Inc for $13.7 billion last year, and a deal for Amazon Prime to sell products from the British supermarket chain Morrisons (MRW.L), raised expectations that it would bid for a retailer or form a partnership in France.  Casino and Amazon said late on Monday that groceries sourced from Monoprix would be available in the Amazon Prime Now app and website through a dedicated virtual store.  The deal is limited to the lucrative Paris market and its suburbs, though Monoprix CEO Regis Schultz told a conference call that an extension to other parts of France could not be ruled out.

It has a strong focus on quality and fresh products in the mould of Whole Foods, and is a key contributor to Casino group profit.  \u201cWe consider the Monoprix product selection as exceptional,\u201d Amazon France CEO Frederic Duval said during the call.  Financial terms were not disclosed, but Schultz said a model where Monoprix does the picking of the order in store and Amazon takes care of delivery was a \u201cprofitable\u201d one for Monoprix.  Slideshow (5 Images)  COMPLEMENTS OCADO DEAL  Casino already has a delivery partnership with UK online retailer Ocado (OCDO.L), signed last year.  The two deals were complementary as the Ocado technology will allow Monoprix to address the needs of its traditional clients with a bigger basket and seeking next-day delivery. Clients of Amazon Prime, set up in Paris in 2016, are looking for fewer items and want express delivery.  Since the purchase of Whole Foods Market, expectations that Amazon could focus next on Europe have spurred French retailers to try to improve their own online offerings.  Carrefour (CARR.PA) announced in January that it would invest 2.8 billion euros in digital commerce over the next five years, six times its current investment.

It was unclear which specific teams inside Amazon were affected. Amazon\u2019s consumer organization includes its retail and marketplace businesses, as well as programs like food delivery service Amazon Restaurants.  Seattle-based Amazon has been on a hiring tear, creating some 130,000 jobs worldwide in 2017 and announcing plans to open a second headquarters in North America, anticipating up to 50,000 more jobs there. Its full-time and part-time headcount surged 66 percent in the fourth quarter to 566,000 from a year earlier. That figure includes employees at Whole Foods Market, which Amazon acquired in a $13.7 billion deal last year.  But many of the corporate jobs are going to areas of soaring profit, like cloud-computing division Amazon Web Services, or areas where Amazon sees potential, like voice-controlled computing.  \u201cOur 2017 projections for Alexa were very optimistic, and we far exceeded them,\u201d said Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder and chief executive, in a statement earlier this month. \u201cWe don\u2019t see positive surprises of this magnitude very often \u2014 expect us to double down.\u201d  Amazon hopes Alexa will become a regular part of consumers\u2019 lives and will spur shopping orders by voice.

I will leave to others the implications for democracy when a U.S. president singles out a company that he wants to punish, but from a business point of view, his crusade is nuts. For all of Trump's huffing and puffing, there is little he can do to inflict pain on Amazon and its chief executive, Jeff Bezos. It's amazing that he can't see it.  The president complains that Amazon doesn't pay taxes. For the most part, that hasn't been true; between 2007 and 2015, it paid a combined tax rate (for federal, state, local and foreign) of 13 percent, on par with many big companies. Last year, however, it did not pay any federal taxes. Why? It appears that Amazon was able to take advantage of some provisions in Trump's pride and joy, the tax cut he signed in December. In addition, while Amazon for years fought efforts to force it to collect state and local sales tax, it has begun doing so, even collecting from its third-party vendors. Besides, there is simply no way Trump can target one company for a different tax treatment than other companies. So much for taxes.  According to the news site Axios, Trump has mused about using antitrust law to whack Amazon. In fact, there are many people who believe that big tech companies like Amazon, Facebook and Google deserve far more antitrust scrutiny than they've gotten, and indeed, that antitrust policy needs to better reflect their enormous power. I'm one of them.  But singling out Amazon is no way to go about it. It causes antitrust experts to shrink from the subject because they don't want to be seen as doing Trump's dirty work. And it puts the Justice Department's antitrust division in a terrible spot. Having already sued to stop AT&T from buying Time Warner after Trump complained about the deal, the division's leaders would look like lackeys if they went after Amazon, too. Indeed, given the current state of antitrust law, which is very forgiving of big companies making big acquisitions, there is nothing for the government to go after Amazon for.  It's possible, I suppose, that Trump could prevent Amazon from getting government contracts. In 2013, the company successfully brought cloud computing to the Central Intelligence Agency, and it is the current front-runner for a 10-year, multi-billion-dollar cloud computing contract with the Pentagon. Other tech companies are lobbying to get a piece of the contract, and perhaps the Defense Department will conclude that it's not worth inviting the president's ire to give it to the company with the most experience and biggest market share. Fear not. Amazon had over $177 billion in revenue last year and is on track to easily top $200 billion in 2018. If it never sees another penny from the government, it will do just fine.  Finally, there is the relationship that Trump has complained about most frequently: Amazon's business with the U.S. Postal Service:  I am right about Amazon costing the United States Post Office massive amounts of money for being their Delivery Boy. Amazon should pay these costs (plus) and not have them bourne by the American Taxpayer. Many billions of dollars. P.O. leaders don\u00e2t have a clue (or do they?)! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 3, 2018  Back in 2012, the Postal Service was in deep trouble. A self-financed agency since the 1980s, it had lost $25 billion over the previous six years, and $6.5 billion in just the first six months of the year. It had three big problems. First, even though it was expected to generate its own revenue, Congress made it hard to do things that could save billions, like closing rural post offices or ending Saturday delivery. Second, Congress imposed a bizarre requirement that it pre-fund retiree health-care premiums to the tune of $5.5 billion a year. And third, fewer and fewer people were sending first-class mail.  The decline in first-class mail continues today. But postal revenue has largely stabilized at around $70 billion, and losses in 2017 were down to $2.7 billion. Why? Because despite the congressional impediments, the Postal Service has done some serious cost-cutting. Also, its package-delivery business is going gangbusters. This is almost entirely thanks to Amazon, which has started to rely on the Postal Service to get packages to customers' front doors.  QuickTake Q&A: Amazon and the Post Office  Although the terms of Amazon's postal contract have never been revealed, it is implausible that the deal costs the post office money, as Trump claims. What's more, if he thinks Amazon is getting too sweet a deal, he is actually in a position to do something about it. The Postal Service's overseer, its Board of Governors, is supposed to comprise 11 people. It currently has two: Megan Brennan, the Postmaster General, and her deputy, Ronald Stroman. Every other seat is empty.  Trump has nominated three people for the board, but even if all three were approved by the Senate, the board would still lack a quorum. And without a quorum, it can't do things like, well, renegotiate big contracts. It would be easy enough for Trump to find nominees who would vow to force Amazon to pay more. But to do that, he'd have to be paying attention to his job.  Trump's real motivation is doubtless to get back at Bezos for his ownership of the Washington Post, which regularly publishes unflattering revelations about his presidency and business life. But he really should have thought twice before going after Amazon and its CEO..  There may be some chief executives who would be rattled by attacks from the president. Bezos is not one of them. You'll notice that so far he hasn't responded to Trump's tweets, and he won't. He's too smart for that. And while Trump has managed to hurt Amazon's valuation, you would be hard-pressed to find a CEO who spends less time worrying about his company's share price than Bezos. Eventually, the market will realize that Trump's threats are toothless, and the stock will come back up again.  There is a final reason why Trump's attacks on Amazon are so misguided. If he could put aside his venom for Bezos, he might be able to see that Amazon is a company that's doing exactly what he says he wants American companies to do. It's creating jobs, not just tech jobs in Seattle but blue-collar jobs in the warehouses it has built around the country. It pays most of the tuition when workers want to learn skills that will lead to better jobs. It's in the process of choosing a second headquarters city where it will eventually employ up to 50,000 workers. It's getting into health care in an effort to bring down costs. It treats customers better than any other tech company. Oh, and its chief competitor isn't an American company but a Chinese one, Alibaba.  So go after Amazon if you insist, Mr. President. But if you keep it up, this is one crusade you may live to regret.

Amazon hadn\u2019t just invaded the home turf of the home-shopping channel QVC. As it has done with food delivery, travel and online payments, the Seattle giant had more or less recreated a rival\u2019s entire approach. In this case, the weapon was an online show, \u201cStyle Code Live,\u201d staffed with bubbly millennials promoting beauty and fashion products you could buy on Amazon.  \u201cThey tried to copy everything about our show,\u201d QVC Chief Executive Officer Mike George said in an interview.  Usually, this is the moment that foreshadows doom for a rival. But QVC didn\u2019t bend to Jeff Bezos\u2019s iron will. In May 2017, a little more than a year after introducing \u201cStyle Code Live,\u201d Amazon canceled the show. The retreat proved that QVC\u2019s formula\u2014unscripted hosts demonstrating products to an audience of mostly women on live television\u2014isn\u2019t as easy as it looks. (Amazon declined to comment.)  QVC hasn\u2019t been immune to the ongoing struggles in retail and television. It had four straight quarters of sales declines before posting an increase last quarter. Sales in some categories, such as hair care and jewelry, have continued to struggle. Like many other pay-TV networks, QVC\u2019s main channel has lost subscribers as more consumers drop their cable subscriptions.  But QVC isn\u2019t just another channel trying to adapt to the rise of cord-cutting or a retail brand looking for a toehold online. About half of QVC sales already happen online, and two-thirds of those purchases come from mobile devices. In January, after completing a $2.1 billion purchase of its rival, the Home Shopping Network, QVC Group became the third largest e-commerce retailer in North America, according to Internet Retailer. That means the combined cable channels trail only Amazon.com Inc. and Walmart Inc. among companies selling products in multiple categories.  Wall Street has noticed, with shares of QVC Group, which includes QVC and smaller retail brands, soaring 51 percent in the past year. The company is owned by John Malone\u2019s Liberty Interactive Corp., which lists the business as a separate tracking stock to reflect its value.  The executives running a channel whose name stands for Quality, Value, Convenience believe their business can survive because it does something that Amazon can't: \u201cYou\u2019re not going to be inspired by Amazon,\u201d said George, a 56-year-old former McKinsey & Co. partner who buys Keurig machines on QVC as birthday gifts. \u201cShopping should be joyful. It should be inspirational. That\u2019s what we can do.\u201d  On set at the QVC campus in West Chester, Pennsylvania. Source: QVC  Standing next to a clothing rack on a recent morning, QVC host Pat James-Dementri urged viewers not to wait to buy a blouse and tank-top set. Order now, she said using a familiar lure, and you can get 30 percent off. She translated the price into the channel's signature math: \u201cThree easy pays of $16.66.\u201d  In a dark room perched above the studio, producer Kevin McGovern wore a headset and monitored two screens. One tracked call volume; the other showed the colors and sizes left. The wine-colored blouse was the hot item this morning, and that real-time dashboard helped create a sense of urgency with shoppers at home. McGovern whispered into the host\u2019s earpiece, and the information went out to QVC\u2019s 100 million homes in James-Dementri\u2019s bright voice: \u201cThe wine is flying out of here!\u201d she told viewers.  While the format looks easy, a complex ballet takes place behind the scenes to make things go smoothly. There are no teleprompters or scripts. QVC hosts improvise, fielding calls and social media questions from viewers in real time. The channel features 770 products each week on the air in the U.S., and the average shopper spends more than $1,200 a year on the network\u2019s products.  \u201cQVC is a retail format that appeals to a woman who loves to shop. It would appear this woman is born every year.\u201d  QVC broadcasts every day, except on Christmas, from a 58,000-square-foot campus in West Chester, Pennsylvania, about 30 miles outside of Philadelphia. The main studio has more than 20 sets that resemble scenes torn from a Pottery Barn catalog, with plush couches and spotless kitchens. There's a 130-seat theater used for live segments with such celebrities as chef Rachel Ray or Catherine Zeta-Jones, who recently launched a home collection. A warehouse nicknamed Noah\u2019s Ark holds 300,000 items\u2014at least two of everything that QVC features on TV each day. There are parallel broadcast operations in seven countries, including China.  In one room, a headless mannequin wore a bra as part of an upcoming segment on Breezies underwear, which was to be a featured item known as \u201cToday\u2019s Special Value.\u201d On a brightly lit set nearby, Dennis Basso, a charismatic white-haired fashion designer, held up one of his dresses as the cameras rolled. \u201cI'm telling you,\u201d Basso said, \u201cthis is sooooo special.\u201d  Seated in a conference room at QVC\u2019s headquarters, George talks about the marriage with Home Shopping Network as something that will do more than save costs or unite celebrity pitchwomen: Serena Williams and Nicki Minaj sell clothing and perfume on HSN, while Martha Stewart and Ellen DeGeneres pitch home d\u00e9cor, beauty products and other items on QVC. The combined channels, George argues, will have the resources to innovate.  HSN was the pioneer in shopping by remote control instead of requiring viewers to pick up the phone or visit a website. Following the merger, George said, QVC is in talks with Comcast Corp. to enable the cable giant\u2019s 22 million subscribers to order items on the channel from their remote controls.  But that strategy will pay off only if QVC viewers keep their cable TV subcriptions. \u201cWe expect QVC to have more difficulty acquiring new customers,\u201d Citi analyst Jason Bazinet wrote in a September note that downgraded its parent company\u2019s stock to sell.  And the shoppers that are sticking around aren\u2019t young. George describes the typical viewer as an upscale woman in her 50s. A recent summary of the stereotypical QVC fan in Philadelphia magazine evoked \u201csilver-haired grannies ordering slow cookers and vibrating belly bands from landline phones.\u201d The public perception of a certain fustiness to the home-shopping demographic makes it challenging to attract millennials.  \u201cIf you go to other online retailers, it\u2019s a transaction. When you come to QVC, it\u2019s a social experience.\u201d  QVC executives insist they\u2019re mostly protected from the pressures facing both TV networks and brick-and-mortar retailers. Cord-cutters are cost-conscious young men, they say, while QVC viewers are women of a certain age with enough disposable income to afford cable-TV subscriptions and discretionary purchases. QVC executives refer to their viewers, who are about 80 percent female, simply as \u201cshe\u201d and \u201cher.\u201d  Those celebrity deals also give the channel a measure of protection by ensuring those products aren\u2019t available on Amazon. Martha Stewart\u2019s chambray blouse and electric snowblower are exclusive to the channel, and her on-air appearances are also streamed live on her Facebook page, introducing many of Stewart\u2019s fans to the shopping channel.  To reach the younger generation, QVC introduced a TV channel, Beauty IQ, that is simulcast on Facebook Live and features beauty experts who have big followings on Instagram and YouTube. In 2015, two years before the deal for the Home Shopping Network, QVC also paid $2.4 billion for Zulily, a flash sales site aimed at millennial moms.    QVC\u2019s digital strategy has started to pay off. The channel added about 417,000 new customers last quarter, the second-biggest increase for that period in 15 years. Amazon is perpetually lurking, of course. It has started to broaden Twitch Interactive, a video-game streaming site it acquired in 2014, to allow artists, chefs and musicians to sell products to their viewers. And about three-quarters of QVC shoppers are also users of the almost inescapable e-commerce site.  But analysts increasingly see QVC\u2019s future as \u201cthe anti-Amazon,\u201d in the words of Barton Crockett at B. Riley FBR Inc. Amazon is about inexhaustible selection, he said, while a 24-hour shopping show is a matter of constant salesmanship.  \u201cQVC is a retail format that appeals to a woman who loves to shop,\u201d Crockett said. \u201cIt would appear this woman is born every year.\u201d  QVC Control room Source: QVC  Some viewers tune in to just see hosts like David Venable. A 53-year-old former TV news anchor in Altoona, Pennsylvania, Venable got his start at QVC in 1993 selling patio furniture during the overnight shift. Today, he hosts two live cooking shows each week, deploying a folksy manner that evokes his southern upbringing. His nonstop patter is filled with anecdotes about how his grandmother and mother taught him to cook.  \u201cIn the Kitchen With David\u201d is one of QVC\u2019s most popular shows, drawing on average more than 2 million viewers. Wearing his apron, Venable answers questions on social media, makes new recipes and demonstrates cookware. He has sold almost 900,000 air fryers. Whenever Venable tastes a dish he really enjoys, he raises his hands and turns in a circle while saying \u201chappy dance, happy dance\u201d over and over. It\u2019s his signature move.  \u201cWe\u2019re establishing a relationship with viewers,\u201d Venable said in an interview. \u201cIf you go to other online retailers, it\u2019s a transaction. When you come to QVC, it\u2019s a social experience.\u201d  One of his most devoted fans is Cam Brockman, a 23-year-old retail sales associate in Charlotte, North Carolina.

On Sundays, she and her boyfriend watch his show during halftime of NFL games.

But what measures can he actually take against the online retail giant?  He could push for probes of consumer protection, privacy and antitrust issues. He could also step up his support for allowing states to collect sales tax on third-party purchases from Amazon, or seek to have the Postal Service charge more to deliver packages. And he could thwart Amazon\u2019s aspirations to win a multibillion dollar Pentagon contract for cloud services.  Even with those powers, Trump\u2019s ability to act has limits. Inquiries by the Justice Department or the Federal Trade Commission could take years and bear a high burden of proof. The FTC and other enforcement agencies guard their independence, as does the board of governors of the Postal Service. Changes to the tax law would require cooperation from Congress, which just passed a tax overhaul and may have limited appetite to reopen negotiations.  The feud pits the world\u2019s most powerful man against one of the world\u2019s biggest corporations -- a global titan with $684 billion in market capitalization and more than half a million employees. At stake is its reputation, revenue and, potentially, ability to continue to disrupt markets as it reshapes retailing.  Any move made by Trump that is perceived as revenge against Amazon founder Jeff Bezos for his ownership of The Washington Post would invite comparisons to President Richard Nixon, who, at the height of the Watergate scandal, threatened the Post\u2019s broadcast licenses.  Amazon didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. While Amazon rose Thursday along with most U.S. stocks, the Trump attacks helped add to the shares\u2019 headwinds on Tuesday  and Wednesday. An 8 percent drop marked Amazon\u2019s biggest two-day decline in two years.  White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters told reporters aboard Air Force One Thursday that there are no specific plans to move against the company. \u201cThe president has expressed his concerns with Amazon,\" she said.  Seek antitrust inquiry of Amazon\u2019s dominance  If the administration opens an antitrust inquiry, enforcers would have to show the company has a monopoly in a market and that it abused its dominant position. But enforcers are intently focused on harm to consumers, and Amazon\u2019s retailing platform is beloved by its customers for its breadth and convenience.  Still, the company is not without criticism. Lina Khan, director of legal policy at Open Markets Institute, a Washington think tank that advocates for tougher antitrust enforcement, says Amazon should be scrutinized. One area of concern is the way Amazon can exploit information it collects about third-party sellers to better compete against them. Amazon can use sales data it gets from these merchants to undercut them on price or start selling its own versions of their products, Khan said.  Jeff Bezos Photographer: Peter Foley/Bloomberg  \"It\u2019s possible to believe two things: one, it\u2019d be deeply troubling and improper for Trump\u2019s personal animus toward Jeff Bezos to be the basis of an antitrust action, and two, Amazon\u2019s structure and conduct raise anticompetitive concerns worthy of an antitrust investigation,\" she said.  Trump\u2019s Justice Department already has shown unorthodox thinking on antitrust enforcement. Last year it sued AT&T Inc. to stop its acquisition of Time Warner Inc. -- which owns CNN, another frequent Trump target. The move surprised many antitrust lawyers because the two companies don\u2019t compete directly.  Competing retailers have long expressed concern about Amazon\u2019s potential to push them out of business but enforcers are skeptical when complaints come from rivals because they want to see vigorous competition in markets.  Make Amazon pay sales taxes like traditional retailers  Trump\u2019s complaints about Amazon not paying sales tax echo those of states and local jurisdictions that have complained about a loss of tax revenue as sales shift from brick-and-mortar stores to Amazon.  Trump supports bipartisan bills in Congress that would allow states to mandate collection of sales taxes because U.S. policy should ensure that \"those who are competing with Amazon are on a level playing field,\" White House spokesman Raj Shah said Thursday.  In 2017, Amazon, which also supports the bills, began collecting sales tax in states that levy them, but the company doesn\u2019t charge shoppers sales tax when they buy from third-party vendors that sell on the site. Those sales make up about half the company\u2019s volume.  States and local governments lose approximately $5 billion a year in taxes from Amazon marketplace commerce because merchants don\u2019t collect them and shoppers don\u2019t pay them after the fact, according to James Thomson, a former Amazon employee who is now a consultant for e-commerce merchants. The company doesn\u2019t break out how much revenue comes from third-party sales.  The Trump administration has also urged the U.S. Supreme Court to let state and local governments collect billions of dollars in sales taxes from online retailers. The justices are scheduled to hear arguments next month centering on a South Dakota law that calls for collecting sales taxes from large internet retailers even if they don\u2019t have brick-and-mortar stores in the state. A ruling is expected by late June.  Charge Amazon higher postage  Trump has said the Postal Service should be charging Amazon more for delivery.  \u201cWhy is the United States Post Office, which is losing many billions of dollars a year, while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages, making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer?\u201d Trump told his 45 million followers in January.  A sudden increase in postal service rates would cost Amazon about $2.6 billion a year, according to an April report by Citigroup. That report predicted United Parcel Service Inc. and FedEx Corp. would also raise rates in response to a postal service hike.  The Postal Regulatory Commission, which sets rates, has one vacant seat among its five commissioners, who are named by the president.  But the Postal Service would also be a loser. Despite Trump\u2019s assertions, Amazon is a valuable customer. And the Postal Service\u2019s losses have little to do with Amazon and more to do with its large health-care obligations and the dwindling use of first-class mail. USPS charges some of the world\u2019s lowest stamp prices.  Brad Parscale, who is managing Trump\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign, hinted that the administration may act to raise Amazon\u2019s postal costs in a tweet late Thursday. \u201cOnce the markets figure out that a single @usps rule change will crush @amazon \u2019s bottom line we will see,\u201d Parscale wrote.  Weigh in against Amazon in the Cloud Wars  Amazon, which has sought government contracts beyond the Postal Service, could also face opposition to its bid to become the sole supplier of the Defense Department\u2019s multibillion dollar cloud services award, which is slated to be made in September and for which Amazon is seen as the front-runner.  The company\u2019s 2013 cloud deal with the CIA for $600 million has put it in pole position to win the award, which could last up to 10 years and put the company ahead in the race for future contracts as the Pentagon pushes to modernize its technology.  The Pentagon\u2019s announcement earlier in March that it would choose one vendor for the contract has prompted criticism from Microsoft Corp., International Business Machines Corp. and industry groups representing rivals such as Oracle Corp.  And lawmakers charged with funding the Pentagon have asked the department to justify the single-source award in language accompanying the recent spending bill.  Trump could issue an executive action that says the government can only contract with smaller firms for instance, although the president\u2019s comments could bolster Amazon\u2019s case if it decided to bring a court challenge, said John Hudak, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution.  \"The president\u2019s own rhetoric about Amazon probably hinders his ability to use executive action,\" Hudak said.  \u2014 With assistance by Lynnley Browning, and Toluse Olorunnipa", "stock": "AMZN", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-29", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-29/amazon-in-trump-s-crosshairs-here-s-what-the-president-could-do"}, {"article": "Bloomberg Boston Bureau Chief Tom Moroney and Radio News Anchors Peter Barnes, Pat Carroll and Anne Mostue are joined by top names from local business and finance to medicine and politics, along with Bloomberg reporters covering the latest stories in Boston, the Bay State and beyond.

Similar partnership announcements followed between Google and other Amazon rivals including EBay Inc. and Target Corp.  Amazon Trumps the President Corporate chiefs mentioned Amazon thousands of times in the last year, more than a certain U.S. president Source: Bloomberg  Google CEO Sundar Pichai told analysts in October that the company was devoting more attention to retailers because of their interest in cloud computing, online advertising, digital payments and other services Google (and Amazon) offer. Pichai didn't mention retailers' fear of Amazon, but he did use the term \"flywheel effect,\" which -- ahem -- is a favorite phrase of Bezos.  Diane Greene, the leader of Google's cloud business, was more direct about the company's motivations this week. At a conference, she said Google was considered a helping hand by retailers, software makers and companies in other industries that aren't eager to use Amazon's cloud service. \"Now everybody is looking at Amazon,\" Greene said. \"We're their friend.\"  That's what you'd expect Google to say, of course. But there's anecdotal evidence that some companies really are avoiding Amazon Web Services, its cloud business. Supermarket chain Kroger Co. uses Microsoft and Google cloud products, but not Amazon's. \"It doesn't make sense for us to do a ton to help grow that business for them,\" a Kroger executive told CNBC last fall. Stock analysts at Piper Jaffray have also heard financial-services and logistics companies expressing concern about using Amazon products, and going to Microsoft instead.  Run down the list of private sectors that spend the most on information technology -- health care, banking, retail, insurance -- and all of them worry Amazon is coming for them. To be sure, it's hard to quantify the Amazon fear effect on Amazon itself. Growth in the company's e-commerce sales and cloud revenue shows few signs of slowing. AWS actually reaccelerated in the fourth quarter.  Amazon Warrior Amazon's revenue reached nearly $180 billion in 2017, and it is growing at more than 25% a year Source: Bloomberg  Amazon paranoia is not new. Some companies have long avoided selling their products on Amazon or using the company's payments tools. My colleague Sarah McBride also wrote more than a year ago about retailers encouraging one another to ditch AWS over concern their money would strengthen Amazon's e-commerce operation.  What's changed is that Amazon has entered a more Death Star-ish phase. After the stunning acquisition of grocery chain Whole Foods last summer, it seemed any company or industry might be in Amazon's sights. Worries about the company's potential incursions may have motivated a $68 billion health care merger. This is not normal.  The widespread corporate fear of Amazon even got the attention of the Onion, which last year published a satirical opinion piece written by \"Jeff Bezos\" with the headline: \"My advice to anyone starting a business is to remember that someday I will crush you.\" Good advice.

And their parents. And most of their grandparents.  But one group of potential customers has eluded the world\u2019s biggest Internet retailer.  Teenagers, otherwise known as Generation Z, with their lack of debit and credit cards, their absence of bank accounts and their overwhelming preference for actually putting on clothes and going to physical stores to buy things they could purchase online, pose a big challenge to Amazon.  Amazon\u2019s answer: The internet behemoth is in early discussions with banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Capital One Financial Corp. to create a product similar to checking accounts, according to people familiar with the matter who requested anonymity. Amazon aims to tailor the accounts to appeal especially to youngsters and those who own no plastic in their wallets, the people said.  Debit Devotees Consumers between the ages of 18-24 prefer debit cards to other forms of payments Source: Total System Services Inc.  \u201cThe sooner you can start collecting information on them, the better prepared you are,\u201d said Tim Barefield, a managing director at the consulting firm Kotter International. \u201cFor Amazon, it\u2019s another way to expand their brand. Their brand is reaching out every place that their tentacles can reach out to.\u201d  The move shows Amazon\u2019s recognition that digital accounts for minors potentially lock in lifetime customers before they even leave their parents\u2019 house. Amazon is savvy about its users\u2019 life cycles. It offers new parents discounts on diapers and baby food. It gives college students discounted Amazon Prime memberships, providing free shipping and access to streaming video so young adults will already be Amazon shoppers when they start making more of their own spending decisions.  Pseudo Card  Since many young people don\u2019t qualify for credit cards, Amazon created a pseudo-debit card called Amazon Cash that lets teenagers drop off money at drugstores such as 7-Eleven Inc. and CVS Health Corp. and add it to an Amazon wallet they can use online.  But Amazon has long known the process is clunky and has wanted to take steps to make it easier for customers without bank accounts to shop on its website. Walmart Inc. and American Express Co. offer accounts called Bluebird that have made inroads with teens.  Amazon, led by billionaire Jeff Bezos, is trying to stay on top even as it had revenue of $178 billion last year, a 31 percent jump from 2016 and an almost 2,500 percent increase from 2004, when many of these potential new customers were born.  Service Charges  Children under the age of 18 typically aren\u2019t able to sign up for a bank account without parental consent. Checking accounts for high school students often come with monthly service charges and overdraft fees.  So there\u2019s a chance for Amazon to improve the banking experience, said Stuart Sopp, chief executive officer of Current, a startup that offers debit cards to teens.  \u201cI\u2019m sure Amazon is scaring the hell out of every single regional bank and credit union right now,\u201d Sopp said. \u201cThe banks have very clearly not serviced these demographics, so there\u2019s opportunity.\u201d  Check Yes Consumers said they were open to banking with Amazon, even if it came with a fee Source: Cornerstone Advisors, StrategyCorps  If Amazon could deliver a better banking experience for digitally savvy youngsters who are used to getting what they want with a few swipes or clicks, they might have banking customers for a long time, said Eric Marks, a senior director at the financial consultancy West Monroe Partners.  Amazon might also entice teens with its personal assistant Alexa. Such devices are popular among teens looking for a convenient way to pay, said Gavin Rosenberg, a senior director at the payments processor Total System Services Inc.  \u201cThe younger generations are less concerned about privacy, so they\u2019re more apt to use them,\u201d Rosenberg said.  Adults, Too  The marketing opportunity doesn\u2019t end with teenagers. The e-commerce giant could also end up persuading people to close their existing bank accounts and open a new one with Amazon, according to a Cornerstone Advisors study published in January. It would also be a chance for a bank to partner with the online gargantuan.  \u201cRight now, banks might not be offering exactly what millennials want or need,\u201d said Marielle Schurig, a financial adviser at UBS Group AG who works with high-net-worth millennials. \u201cA lot of monthly statements don\u2019t offer insights or tools to manage your records or analyze your spending to budget or save for the future\u201d -- something Amazon might provide.  Even with as much as a $10 monthly fee, 27 percent of young millennials polled said they would open an additional checking account with Amazon. One-tenth said they would close their existing account and go with Amazon.  \u201cThis is music to Amazon\u2019s ears,\u201d Cornerstone said in its report. \u201cWhy would they want to offer a free checking account when they can bundle the services of various providers on their platform -- merchants and financial services providers -- and charge a fee for it.

Though filled with less import than the company\u2019s $13.4 billion acquisition of Whole Foods Market last year, the deal was the second-largest in Amazon\u2019s history. And like all acquisitions, it gives us a rare glimpse into the way Jeff Bezos sees the future.  In the short term, Ring gives Amazon another piece in its Alexa puzzle and a leg up in its race against Google and Apple to control homes that will increasingly be filled with connected appliances. Alexa is a nice novelty now, great for serving up the weather, reading the news and hosting the occasional trivia game. But it will be really useful when it\u2019s the hub that lets people use their voice to arm their security systems, open locked doors and flash video of the person who\u2019s ringing the doorbell out front. Google understands this as well; the new $229 Nest doorbell will come with a free Google Home Mini when it starts shipping this spring.  Alexa currently works with a host of third-party smart home products. But owning Ring\u2019s varied assortment of video doorbells, security cameras and accessories allows Amazon to accelerate their development and make them exclusive to Alexa. (It bought a similar company, Blink, last year.) Amazon can also do the typical Amazon thing and lower prices, probably by incorporating the optional subscription plans for keeping recorded video into the soup of benefits that is a Prime membership.  There\u2019s also a medium-term benefit to adding Ring. Package theft, a.k.a. \u201cporch pirates,\u201d is a rampant problem in much of the country, one that has required Amazon delivery people to start emailing customers photographs of packages left by the front door, and which, in the past, has forced the company to restrict same-day delivery from neighborhoods with high crime rates. Last year, Amazon introduced a home camera and a service called Amazon Key, which automatically opens doors for verified delivery people. Amazon Key works with so-called \u201csmart locks\u201d made by other companies. Ring doesn\u2019t sell door locks just yet, but you can imagine a day when Amazon owns all the components to make such a service work.  The implications of the Amazon-Ring deal are really interesting to contemplate when we start thinking farther out. We know Amazon wants to deliver groceries. But leaving bags of kale and cartons of milk outside for hours doesn\u2019t work, and many Amazon Fresh subscribers aren\u2019t crazy about accumulating those bulky blue totes filled with dry ice. When Amazon is behind your home security system, your doorbells and door locks, Amazon workers will be able to walk in, unpack the bags and bring the milk right to the refrigerator.  But why stop with groceries? With its endless appetites, Amazon wants to expand in the massive home-services category, fertile ground for companies like Handy Technologies Inc. and Thumbtack Inc. Imagine sitting at school or in your office and being able to buzz in the cable guy or a plumber after verifying they are who they say they are with live video on your phone. Or we can go even further: The Amazon front door and security system could one day open for your trusted housekeeper, dog-walker or exterminator, and no one else.  To keep growing at 30 percent a year, Amazon has to start selling us services, not just stuff. The Ring acquisition, with its smart doorbells and security cameras, is another step along that path. Rivals should beware: Amazon\u2019s move into smart home devices is going to give all new meaning to the words \u201clock in.\u201d  This article also ran in Bloomberg Technology\u2019s Fully Charged newsletter.

One of Katz\u2019s early investors was John Doerr of venture firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. The firm was taken by the Japanese idea of keiretsu, a network of like-minded companies that support one another through partnerships and equity stakes. Audible and Amazon.com Inc. seemed like ideal candidates, Doerr told Katz when suggesting a team-up with Bezos: \u201cHe likes books, too.\u201d  Katz on the steps of a Newark, N.J., church Audible acquired and is turning into a 400-employee \u201ctechnology center.\u201d Photographer: Meron Menghistab for Bloomberg  Katz flew to Seattle and met Bezos for coffee. Audible\u2019s success, Katz acknowledged, would rely on an impending internet revolution, where both portable digital media players and the practice of downloading files over high-speed data networks became commonplace. Bezos told Katz he was focusing on selling physical books, because it\u2019d be a quicker way to go mainstream. Audible, he predicted, was an idea that would take a decade to mature.  The two men kept in touch. At various points, Bezos stepped up involvement in Audible, until Amazon bought the company outright in 2008, leaving Katz to run it as an independent subsidiary. By the time of the acquisition, Audible had created a market for book lovers doing the dishes or on a jog. \u201cI began to think you could take all this time, which is dead time, and potentially make it reading time,\u201d Katz says.  As Amazon has in the years since, Audible first built the infrastructure for a novel form of media consumption, then slowly trained customers to adopt it. While the traditional media industry was apathetic or resistant, the company gradually increased the production of its own material. Audible has continued to bet heavily on this approach, starting a division late last year to produce original content on a much larger scale.  Today, Amazon is the book industry\u2019s b\u00eate noire, while Audible and its rivals represent a tiny bright spot for the beleaguered publishing industry. Audiobook sales totaled $2.1 billion in 2016, the most recent year for which data are available, according to the Audio Publishers Association. That\u2019s about 18 percent higher from the previous year and two and a half times the market size when Amazon bought Audible.  Audible accounts for about 41 percent of all audiobooks sold, including digital and physical formats, according to researcher Codex Group LLC. Amazon also sells audiobooks directly through its website and, with Audible, accounts for more than half the market. Audible doesn\u2019t disclose financial information, but says its annual subscriber growth is in double digits. Most customers pay $15 for a monthly subscription that comes with a single audiobook. (A la carte, they often cost more than $20.) The company\u2019s library includes 400,000 titles.  For years, the company operated without any real competition on the fringes of the $26 billion publishing industry. Google and Walmart Inc., though, have recently announced plans to sell audiobooks online. Publishers are growing more aggressive about retaining the rights to produce audio versions of their books, and the price of such rights is increasing quickly. \u201cWe don\u2019t like to work with Audible. Working with Amazon is always a treacherous affair,\u201d says Dennis Johnson, co-founder of Brooklyn-based Melville House Publishing. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly concerned with their dominance in the marketplace.\u201d  Katz says there\u2019s been outcry at every technological innovation in media, from recorded music to the paperback book. He argues the creation of the digital audiobook industry benefited even his critics.  Bezos in 1997. Photographer: Paul Souders  There was an audiobooks market, kind of, when Katz began working on Audible in the mid-1990s. They came as either huge boxes of cassettes or CDs, or in more accessible versions that were brutally abridged. Katz, who\u2019d written three books by that time, was appalled by sloppily condensed audiobooks where narrators adopted the flattest affects possible. \u201cThey did things to books that, from a writer\u2019s perspective, were unconscionable,\u201d he says.  The idea for Audible occurred to him as he was hitting a wall with a book project about how technology was going to change culture. He found the ideas convincing but struggled to write about trends that hadn\u2019t yet taken hold. He also worried that he\u2019d peaked with Home Fires, a 1992 book tracking a single Long Island family from World War II to the early \u201990s. He decided to turn his latest project into a startup instead.  Enlisting the help of a college roommate who was working in Silicon Valley, Katz developed a proposal for a company that would make digital audio players, then build a store of digital audiobooks to download onto them. He raised $3 million in funding, half from Doerr\u2019s firm, and set up shop in a former dentist\u2019s office in Montclair, N.J. It was slow work. By 1999, Audible had about 3,000 listeners.  Of course, in the Pets.com era, that seemed like enough of an audience to take the company public. It raised $38 million in an initial public offering in July 1999, and watched the price of its shares double on the first day of trading. But when the dot-com bubble collapsed the following year, Audible went down with it. In its wake, the late comedian Robin Williams, who\u2019d accepted equity in Audible as payment for his work on a spoken-word comedy project, said Katz had paid him \u201cin Confederate currency.\u201d Nasdaq delisted Audible\u2019s shares in 2003.  By then, Amazon had bought 5 percent of the company, and Apple Inc. provided an even bigger lifeline when it integrated Audible\u2019s proprietary file format into early versions of the iPod. Thanks largely to the iPod, Audible\u2019s revenue surged almost sevenfold from 2001 to 2006, Katz says.  It wasn\u2019t enough. The company had lost money every year but one and lived in fear of a hypothetical well-financed competitor spending it into oblivion. In 2006, Katz began talking in earnest to Bezos about being acquired. At the time, Amazon was preparing its first major foray into digital media with the Kindle. In 2007 it bought Brilliance Audio, another audiobook publisher. In early 2008, Amazon agreed to buy Audible for about $300 million in cash. It was two years behind the timeline for maturity that Bezos had laid out when the two men first met.  Since the deal, Katz has built a prominent profile in Newark, N.J. He gives free Audible subscriptions to public school students, is turning an historic church into a 400-employee \u201ctechnology center,\u201d and enthusiastically endorses the city\u2019s pitch to put Amazon\u2019s second headquarters there. Amazon recently said Newark was one of 20 cities it\u2019s considering as a location. Katz laughingly demurs when asked whether he\u2019s called Bezos to plead the city\u2019s case. \u201cEveryone at Amazon knows my beliefs about Newark,\u201d he says.  It\u2019s sometimes unclear how close Audible wants Amazon to come. The parent company has provided relief from the public markets, capital, and access to its tech. Audible\u2019s engineers got an early look at the Echo speaker to start planning their integration into Amazon\u2019s voice-control platforms, and current and former Audible employees say the connection helped with recruitment. Yet Katz wants to ensure Audible is seen as its own entity with a separate culture. \u201cOverplaying the Amazon part of our story tends to track away from reality,\u201d he says.  In some cases, the company could stand to benefit from greater oversight. In an email to employees last November, Katz acknowledged complaints that the workplace was \u201cless of a safe space for women than it has been intended to be.\u201d Two senior executives resigned after an ensuing investigation, and the company says it will introduce new anti-harassment training, declining to comment further.  Audible is firmly entrenched as the king of its small hill. It\u2019s the only recognizable audiobook brand, and because customers pay for monthly subscriptions rather than buy each book a la carte, they\u2019re less prone to comparison shop. Audible customers, who range from subway riders to folks washing their dishes, spend an average of two hours a day with the app.  The company\u2019s hand in the retail market is even greater than it first appears. For years, Audible and Apple had a deal where Audible would provide the actual files that Apple sells through iTunes, giving Audible a cut of every sale from its most significant competitor. The deal included an exclusivity clause preventing Apple from sourcing audiobooks from other companies, and Audible agreed not to provide its files to competing platforms. Last year the two companies ended the deal after European publishers complained it was anticompetitive.  Michele Cobb, executive director of the Audio Publishers Association, says this is likely to spur competition. \u201cThere are just a lot more players than there were three years ago,\u201d she says. The most powerful rivals may be Google and Walmart, though neither company has yet mounted a serious challenge.  Competition to make audiobooks has ramped up in recent years, adding to Audible\u2019s library. There were more than 50,000 audiobooks produced in 2016, according to the APA, more than twice the number two years earlier.  The appetite for new titles has pushed up the price of audiobook rights, according to publishers. \u201cThe cost of rights has increased in recent years because of the rapid growth in the marketplace,\u201d says Troy Juliar, chief content officer of Recorded Books, which publishes about 4,000 audiobooks a year. Literary agents are increasingly interested in retaining audio rights, and publishers often refuse to sign book deals without them.  If publishers frequently choose to work around Audible, the company has also looked to lessen its reliance on publishers. In 2016 it launched a podcast service. Last year it announced it was investing $5 million in theater productions that could be easily converted into a smartphone format.  David Blum, who spent most of the past decade running Amazon\u2019s Kindle Singles operation, now runs Audible\u2019s original publishing operation. Blum\u2019s official charge is to increase the number of Audible projects that aren\u2019t simply readings of the printed word. Margaret Atwood, author of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, recently worked with Audible to write and record a spoken-word coda to the novel, and comedian David Spade is developing an audio-only memoir. \u201cWe\u2019re really trying to break the boundaries,\u201d Blum says, \u201cand go to writers and creators and artists to think outside the traditional boundaries of what is a book.\u201d", "stock": "AMZN", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-13", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-13/amazon-turbocharged-audible-s-domination-of-audiobooks"}, {"article": "The Amazon blame game took another turn on Thursday, when President Donald Trump spun the wheel back around to the U.S. Postal Service. Amazon.com Inc. is a convenient scapegoat for just about any issue. The mail is no different.  Amazon isn\u2019t killing the post office. Since signing a landmark contract in 2013 to expand their business relationship and deliver packages on Sunday, revenue has ticked up; losses are down; and shipping is just about the only growth segment in the mailbag. The Postal Service is saddled by larger issues. Sure, there\u2019s the internet, and nobody is sending postcards anymore, but the big financial dilemma is the agency\u2019s yearly obligation to set aside cash to cover health care costs for future retirees. This accounts for billions in losses.  Give Up? U.S. Postal Service makes small improvements but is nowhere close to sustainable Source: U.S. Postal Service  U.S. mail is also required to cover every American, employing carriers who roam neighborhoods six days a week (or seven, if Amazon has a package ready). The Postal Service has said it actually makes money on the Amazon deal. E-commerce revenue provides \u201cessential support to pay for the network and infrastructure that enables us to fulfill our universal service obligation,\u201d David Partenheimer, a spokesman for the Postal Service, wrote in a January op-ed. \u201cAll users of the mail benefit.\u201d  The Amazonification of U.S. Mail Shipping revenue overtook junk mail for the first time last year Source: U.S. Postal Service  Amazon rebuilt its delivery network around the post several years ago. The company operates \u201c sortation centers\u201d that complement warehouses and organize packages by zip code before sending them to post offices for the final leg of delivery. In Kenosha, Wisconsin, Amazon has a million-square-foot warehouse, connected to a 500,000-square-foot sort center with a covered conveyor belt that resembles an airport skybridge.  Ending the U.S. mail relationship would probably be a bigger setback for Amazon than for the Postal Service. On a dark day in late 2011 when the postmaster general proposed cutting 100,000 staff and shutting thousands of post offices, EBay Inc. shares dropped more than 6 percent. Amazon\u2019s deal came soon after, and radical cuts were avoided\u2014probably not a coincidence.  So the e-commerce giant got the Postal Service off life support, but any benefit beyond that is minimal. Nothing short of a complete overhaul of the mail system, some kind of bankruptcy-style financial restructuring or reneging on those health-care promises would turn the Postal Service into a sustainable business.  Maybe that\u2019s Trump\u2019s goal. Building an antitrust case against Amazon\u2014an idea the President has floated\u2014is a tall order. Amazon\u2019s five-year contract with the Postal Service could be up for renewal this year.

But no one expected him to pull in Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon, too.  News Tuesday that Bezos\u2019s Amazon.com Inc., Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co., led by Dimon, plan to join forces to change how health care is provided to their combined 1 million U.S. employees sent shock waves through the health-care industry.  The plan, while in early stages and focused solely on the three giants\u2019 staff for now, seems almost certain to set its sights on disrupting the broader industry. It\u2019s the first big move by Amazon in the sector after months of speculation that the internet behemoth might make an entry. The Amazon-Berkshire-JPMorgan collaboration will likely pressure profits for middlemen in the health-care supply chain.  Details were scant in a short joint statement on Tuesday. The three companies said they plan to set up a new independent company \u201cthat is free from profit-making incentives and constraints.\u201d  It was enough to sink health-care stocks.

The group announced the news in the very early stages because it plans to hire a CEO and start partnering with other organizations, according to a person familiar with the matter. The effort would be focused internally first, and the companies would bring their data and bargaining power to bear on lowering health-care costs, the person said. Potential ways to bring down costs include providing more transparency over the prices for doctor visits and lab tests, as well as by enabling direct purchasing of some medical items, the person said.  \u201cI\u2019m in favor of anything that helps move the markets a bit, incentivizes competition and puts pressure on the big insurance carriers,\u201d said Ashraf Shehata, a partner in KPMG LLP\u2019s health care and life sciences advisory practice in the U.S. \u201cAn employer coalition can do a lot of things.

In the statement, JPMorgan CEO Dimon said the initiative could ultimately expand beyond the three companies.  \u201cOur goal is to create solutions that benefit our U.S. employees, their families and, potentially, all Americans,\u201d he said.  HTA Alliance  Amazon, Berkshire and JPMorgan are among the largest private employers in the U.S. And they\u2019re among the most valuable, with a combined market capitalization of $1.6 trillion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  This isn\u2019t the first time big companies have teamed up in an effort to tackle health-care costs. International Business Machines Corp., Berkshire\u2019s BNSF Railway and American Express Co. were among the founding members of the Health Transformation Alliance, which now includes about 40 big companies that want to transform health care. The group ultimately partnered with existing industry players including CVS and UnitedHealth Group Inc.\u2019s OptumRx.  Top Team  The latest effort is being spearheaded by Todd Combs, who helps oversee investments at Berkshire; Marvelle Sullivan Berchtold, a managing director of JPMorgan; and Beth Galetti, a senior vice president for human resources at Amazon.  Todd Combs Photographer: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg  Buffett handpicked Combs in 2010 as one of his two key stockpickers. Combs, 47, has been taking on a larger role at Berkshire in recent years, and Buffett has said that Combs and Ted Weschler, who also helps oversee investments, will eventually manage the company\u2019s whole portfolio. Combs also joined JPMorgan\u2019s board in 2016.  Sullivan Berchtold joined JPMorgan in August after eight years at the Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis AG, where she was most recently the global head of mergers and acquisitions, according to her LinkedIn profile.  One of the highest ranking women at Amazon, Galetti has worked in human resources at the e-commerce giant since mid-2013, becoming senior vice president almost two years ago, according to her LinkedIn profile. As of late 2017 she was the only woman on Amazon\u2019s elite S-team, a group of just over a dozen senior executives who meet regularly with Bezos, according to published reports. Previously Galetti worked in planning, engineering and operations at FedEx Express, the cargo airline of FedEx Corp. She has a degree in electrical engineering from Lehigh University and an MBA from Colorado Technical University.  The management team, location of the headquarters and other operational details will be announced later, the companies said.  Health-care spending was estimated to account for about 18 percent of the U.S. economy last year, far more than in other developed nations. Buffett has long bemoaned the cost of U.S. health care. Last year, he came out in favor of drastic changes in the U.S. health system, telling PBS NewsHour that government-run health care is probably the best approach and would bring down costs.  \u201cThe ballooning costs of health care act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy,\u201d Buffett said in Tuesday\u2019s statement. \u201cOur group does not come to this problem with answers.

If the Berkshire/JPMorgan venture is as ambitious as it seems, incumbents are in trouble.  The great and oft-heralded Amazon.com Inc. foray into health care is here, and it's not what we expected.  The company isn't diving headlong into drug distribution or becoming a pharmacy benefit manager (PBM). Along with JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Berkshire Hathaway Inc., it announced a more interesting idea Tuesday -- a new company aimed at lowering the cost of employee health coverage.  Though no one sector will face the full wrath of Bezos, this joint venture is a potential competitive threat to all of health care's many middlemen.  Bad News, Guys The vague but potentially dreadful news of an Amazon/Berkshire Hathaway/JPMorgan health care venture sank managed care and PBM stocks on Tuesday Source: Bloomberg  This isn't Corporate America's first stab at controlling ballooning health-care costs. Caterpillar Inc. runs its own PBM for employees. Forty plus U.S. companies are part of the Health Transformation Alliance, founded in 2016 to \"fix our broken health care system\" by pooling data and uniting to wrest better terms from PBMs, among other things.  But Amazon, Berkshire and JPMorgan seem to have bigger ambitions than just negotiating prices with service providers. You don't need to create a whole new company or devote significant resources to do that.  A key line in the detail-light release announcing the new company is that it will be \"free from profit-making incentives.\" That looks like a shot at PBMs and health insurers, who try to lower costs but also maximize profit for stakeholders, resulting in a perverse and very expensive system. But it could also be aimed at health-care providers, given their Byzantine pricing and the outsize share of costs they represent.  The release said the new company's \"initial focus\" will be on using technology to provide simpler, cheaper, and more transparent health care for employees of the three founding firms. Whatever that means, it seems likely the ultimate aim may be to independently design and run employee health coverage.  With nearly 1.2 million employees and hundreds of billions in combined revenue -- along with the combined expertise of three of the most successful companies in history -- Amazon, Berkshire and JPMorgan have the requisite firepower to do this.  A Bit of Muscle Amazon, Berkshire, and JPMorgan have scale and financial firepower to put behind their new health-care venture Source: Bloomberg/fililngs  Insurers and PBMs now must worry about other companies following this blueprint. Even scarier for them is the idea that the Amazon/Berkshire/JPMorgan company will eventually recruit other employers to join it. That's a real possibility, given the venture's ambition and the fact that it's creating a new company rather than a less-formal alliance. In the release, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon teased the idea of potentially helping \"all Americans.\"  Incumbents aren't necessarily doomed just yet. This venture is in its infancy, and health care is complicated. The U.S. system is opaque, fragmented, and heavily regulated. Technology is often proclaimed as a health-care cost panacea, and rarely delivers.  The most effective way to reduce health-care costs is to restrict choice. People hate when they are denied their preferred care or medicine by an insurer or PBM. Imagine the reaction (and broader brand consequences) if Amazon is doing the denying.  There's also the question of negotiating power. The triumvirate may have 1.2 million employees, but UnitedHealth Group Inc. -- to take one example -- provides or manages employee health insurance for nearly 30 million people.  But because the new company isn't initially trying to make a profit and will likely aim to avoid paying high fees to middlemen, it may not have to push provider or drug prices quite as low to get a good result. Think the difference between active and passive management, but for health care.  The pedigree of the companies involved and the current lack of detail may have me reading too much into this effort. But if it's as ambitious as it sounds, then health-care incumbents are in trouble.

The online retail giant plans to roll out two-hour delivery at Whole Foods this year to those who pay for Amazon's $99-a-year Prime membership. It is the company's biggest move since it bought the organic grocer last year.  It's also precisely the action rivals have been preparing for since the day Amazon \u2014 with the Prime program that's been so successful in cementing customer loyalty \u2014 announced plans to buy Whole Foods.  Amazon shoppers can order meat, seafood and other Whole Foods grocery items through the Prime Now app and website. Deliveries started Thursday in Austin, Texas; Cincinnati; Dallas; and Virginia Beach, Virginia; and will expand nationwide this year.  While convenient, not everyone wants other people picking out their eggs or fruit. A major hurdle for companies that offer grocery delivery is getting those people to sign up, said Darren Seifer, a food and beverage industry analyst at NPD Group.  \"There are always going to be people who want their bananas a little green,\" he said.  Ade Ogbomo, a teacher in Dallas, said she orders everything from Amazon \u2014 except food.  \"I like to get it myself,\" she said outside a Whole Foods store. She worries about the possible mishaps: \"Maybe the bananas are bruised or the cookies are all broken up, and you can't really complain because you asked for it.\"  Good, though, said she thinks Whole Foods has high-enough quality produce that she's not worried about choosing items herself.  About 7 percent of U.S. households bought groceries online last year, according to NPD Group. Most of those \u2014 about three-quarters \u2014 get their orders delivered to their door; the rest pick it up at the store. NPD Group said it expects online grocery shopping to grow quickly, especially among young adults, who are more comfortable shopping online.  And grocery chains don't want to miss out when that happens.  Walmart, the country's largest grocer, is making it easier for customers to order groceries online and pick them up at the store. Target bought grocery-delivery company Shipt late last year. Kroger, the largest traditional supermarket chain, has been promoting store pickup for online orders and doing trials of home delivery.  Maggie Anderson, 38, a therapist in Cincinnati, said she has tried it at Remke, a regional chain.  \"I just did my first order online at Remke this week because I was of out of town, and that was great,\" she said. \"It saved me a whole hour and a half of time.\"  For Amazon, items will be pulled from Whole Foods stores, bagged and then delivered by Amazon drivers. Amazon, based in Seattle, said there's no extra fee for two-hour deliveries above $35, but one-hour delivery will cost $8. The company isn't saying where delivery will expand, but its Prime Now service is in more than 30 cities, including Chicago, Milwaukee and San Diego.  The announcement gives Amazon yet another way to get groceries to customer's doorsteps.  It already does so through AmazonFresh, but that requires a $15-a-month fee. And Prime Now delivers groceries from its facilities, but it has also offered grocery delivery from other physical stores, including Whole Foods rival Sprouts Farmers Market.  Whole Foods also offers delivery in some cities through a partnership with delivery service Instacart, which will continue.  Buying Whole Foods was the biggest part of a push into physical retail for the chain known for online shopping. Right after taking over Whole Foods, Amazon made a splash by cutting prices on bananas, yogurt and other items. It also began selling Kindle e-readers in some of its 470 stores, and started selling Whole Foods-branded food on its site.  Good's friend Debbie Alf, who picked up some fruit and lunchmeat on Thursday, said she's intrigued by the two-hour delivery pledge. Would she give it a try?  \"Maybe sooner than you think,\" she said. \"If I forgot something, maybe later today.\"  ____  Pisani reported from New York and Sewell reported from Cincinnati.

Amazon is set to enter the Vietnamese market by providing e-commerce services for the Vietnam E-commerce Association (VECOM), which is a group of 140 local online businesses, according to the Nikkei Asian Review.  Amazon will help these companies sell and export their products through its platform, and details of its plans are expected to come at the Vietnam Online Business Forum 2018 on March 14.  Partnering with third-party merchants is likely a precursor to Amazon entering the market with its full slate of offerings. Before launching its full marketplace and warehouse in Australia, Amazon helped Australian third-party sellers make offshore sales, and prior to recent reports that Amazon is looking to launch in Brazil, it ran a marketplace for third-party sales of electronics and appliances. The Seattle-based company may be looking to use its partnership with VECOM as a way of getting its footing in Vietnam and building familiarity with consumers before introducing its full marketplace, Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA), Prime, and more.  This launch in Vietnam suggests that Southeast Asia is a focus for Amazon's international expansion plans. Amazon also launched in Singapore, its first market in Southeast Asia, in July 2017, where it is now operating in full with Prime and Prime Now. These first two forays occurring so close to each other may mean that Amazon has grand plans for the region, which would make sense as Southeast Asia's e-commerce sales are projected to climb to $88 billion by 2025, up from an estimated $11 billion in 2017. The region is particularly valuable to Amazon because the growth of its Prime subscriber base is reportedly slowing, and international markets, especially ones with the potential of Southeast Asia, could provide a significant boost.  Amazon will face stiff competition in Vietnam, and Southeast Asia as a whole, from Alibaba and JD.com. In Vietnam specifically, Lazada, which Alibaba owns 83% of, controls approximately 30% of the country's e-commerce business, according to the Nikkei Asian Review.com. JD.com has shown interest as well, investing approximately $50 million in Tiki, a Vietnam-based online retailer that it intends to help with fulfillment, logistics, and more. The presence of both of these powerful companies will make it difficult for Amazon to succeed in Vietnam, and if the company looks to expand to other markets, like Indonesia, it will find similar situations, often with Alibaba and JD.com having a significant head start.", "stock": "AMZN", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-13", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-to-enter-vietnam-2018-3"}, {"article": "BI Intelligence  This story was delivered to BI Intelligence \"Payments Briefing\" subscribers hours before appearing on Business Insider.

Software firm Daon has developed software that will allow customers to use Amazon Alexa-enabled devices, like Echo smart speakers, to send and receive peer-to-peer (P2P) transfers with their banks, according to CNET.  The tool would have customers ask Alexa to open Daon, tell the skill to check a balance or send funds, and give a name, at which point the user would be pushed to authenticate biometrically using their phone. Recipients would have to be added as a designated payee option using online or mobile banking in order to prevent fraud. Daon doesn't yet have any partners to launch the service, but is reportedly in talks with various players that could bring the tool to fruition within the next 18 months.  The move comes as the P2P payments space continues to expand, and as banks look to take a further stake in the game. Business Insider Intelligence estimates that mobile P2P volume will hit $336 billion in 2021, up from $19 billion six years earlier. As volume grows, more players are moving into the space, including banks that are part of the Zelle network, and third-party players, like Apple and Google, which are developing their own services.  As banks specifically seek to compete, a voice partnership would be a smart move, since it could give them early entry to a growing market and fast access to a wide swath of potential users. This news comes following rumors about Amazon pushing to partner with a bank to develop a checking-account-like product, which could incorporate technology like Daon's to extend functionality to Alexa products, making it a win-win for both players.  But voice-based P2P could face obstacles that are tough to overcome.  Voice payments are becoming more popular, but they still appeal to just a small share of the population. Last year, 8% of US adults had used voice commands to buy something or send money \u2014 a figure poised to quadruple by 2022, representing massive gains but still keeping adoption at just 31% of the overall population.

Daon's product has tools to counteract that, like authentication and payee designation, but even with bank branding, which might help, it likely won't be enough to overcome all fears. On top of that, these measures detract from the consumer experience by pushing them back to their mobile device to complete the payment. For many users looking for convenience, it might be tough to justify a multi-device payment when they could simply use an existing service via smartphone alone, especially since many of these already have voice integrations through Siri on iPhones, for example.

The phones are usually discounted in exchange for ads to be shown on a user's lockscreen.  Future phones will not come with lock screen Amazon ads, either.  Phones purchased through the program still come pre-loaded with Amazon apps.  Amazon announced on Tuesday that it will remove the ads from the discounted Android phones on its Amazon Prime Exclusive Phones program on Wednesday.  Currently, Android phones on the Amazon Prime Exclusive Phones program display Amazon deals and offers on their lock screens. In exchange, customers get a decent discount on Android phones from well-known manufacturers, provided you're a member of the $99/year Amazon Prime program.  Discounts are always great, but it's a tradeoff that some weren't willing to make.  Previously, getting a phone through the program meant you couldn't customize the background wallpaper of the lock screen. Amazon also said that removing the ads from the lock screen will allow for these phones to support features like facial recognition and fingerprint scanners.  LG  Certain phones, like the LG G6+, are only available on Amazon's Exclusive Phone program. Others, like the Moto G5 Plus and Moto E4 are available from Motorola's online store. Essentially, it means that Amazon Prime members can now buy certain Android phones for a lower cost than almost anywhere else, without the compromise of dealing with Amazon ads on their lock screens.  For example, the Moto G5 Plus costs $200 on Amazon's program, whereas it costs $230 from Motorola's site. And the $500 LG G6+, an Amazon exclusive, is a larger version of the LG G6, which costs $600 or more.  Still, the phones will continue to come pre-loaded with Amazon apps, so you're still buying into the retailer's ecosystem.  As of Tuesday, you have a pretty decent choice of phones from the Amazon Exclusive Phones program. With that said, newer phones models from companies like LG and Moto are expected to be released soon, so it may be wiser to wait for the newer models when they arrive on the Amazon Exclusive Phone program.

Mario Tama/Getty Images  Amazon's fourth-quarter results, which it announced Thursday, topped analyst expectations.  The company's cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services, grew rapidly and again provided the bulk of Amazon's profits.  Investors cheered the results, sending the company's stock up 6% in after-hours trading.  Amazon's stock jumped more than 6% after the e-commerce giant topped Wall Street's fourth-quarter expectations.  The company reported its holiday-period results on Thursday afternoon. At the time of writing, Amazon's stock was up $85.00 a share, or 6.1%, to $1,475.00.

Earnings per share: $3.75; analysts were expecting $1.83 a share. The company's bottom line was boosted by a windfall of $789 million \u2014 or $1.59 a share \u2014 related to the new tax law. Without that benefit, the company would have earned $2.15 a share, beating estimates regardless.  Amazon also shared its guidance for the first quarter of 2018:  Revenue (Q1 projected): Between $47.75 billion and $50.75 billion; Wall Street had projected $48.7 billion. Amazon posted $35.7 billion in revenue in the first quarter of 2017.  Between $47.75 billion and $50.75 billion; Wall Street had projected $48.7 billion. Amazon posted $35.7 billion in revenue in the first quarter of 2017. Operating income (Q1 projected): Between $300 million and $1 billion. Amazon posted $1 billion in operating income in the first quarter last year.  The company's results showed once again the strength of AWS \u2014 and its importance to Amazon's bottom line. Revenue from the company's cloud business grew 45% in the fourth quarter from the same period a year earlier.  Meanwhile, AWS's operating income grew by 46%, to $1.4 billion. That means AWS accounted for 73% of the net income Amazon posted for the period.  Amazon gave only scant details about Whole Foods, the grocery chain it bought last year. The internet company's physical stores, which are largely its Whole Foods outlets, collectively brought in $4.5 billion in sales in the holiday quarter.  By comparison, Whole Foods as a standalone company brought in $4.9 billion in sales in its fiscal first quarter of 2017, approximately the same period a year earlier. But the sales results were actually ahead of Amazon's forecasts, Brian Olsavsky, Amazon's chief financial officer, said on a conference call with investors.  For the quarter, Whole Foods posted a small operational loss, thanks to some non-cash charges, Olsavsky said. Whole Foods earned $95 million in its comparable quarter a year earlier.  Amazon is focusing on cutting prices at the grocery chain, even beyond those it rolled out immediately after taking control of Whole Foods last August, Olsavsky said. But its integration of Whole Foods is continuing apace, he suggested.  The company has already placed some of its automated lockers \u2014 which customers can use to pick up products or return products they've ordered online \u2014 in Whole Foods stores. It plans to list Whole Foods products on the Amazon website and to introduce a customer rewards program, Olsavsky said.  \"Well have more later in the year,\" he said. He continued: \"There's much more to come.\"  Some analysts and investors were skeptical about Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods and have been wondering how far along the company is in integrating Whole Foods into the rest of its operations.

He reportedly feels that Amazon is not paying its fair share of taxes, and has previously claimed that The Washington Post is being used to cover up Amazon's supposed evasion, as Jeff Bezos runs Amazon and owns the newspaper. President Trump is also unhappy with how he believes Amazon is hurting the retail industry, and brick-and-mortar retailers in particular.  President Trump does not currently have a specific plan to attack Amazon, and one may never comes to pass, but there are several ways he could go about it.  Antitrust regulation: Amazon captures a huge percentage of US e-commerce sales and e-commerce growth, without showing signs of slowing down, which has led many to consider the case that it is a monopoly that should be broken up. Such a case would not be close to a slam dunk, as it's unclear if Amazon is a threat to competition or considered to be one under antitrust laws. But if it was successful, the resulting regulations would alter Amazon significantly.

Sales taxes:Amazon collects sales tax in jurisdictions where it is required to, but online sales tax laws vary from state-to-state and city-to-city, and this complexity leads to Amazon not having to collect taxes in certain places. Additionally, in many states, Amazon does not collect taxes for sales from its third-party vendors, leaving it up to them. However, many of these merchants are unclear of their responsibilities, and therefore hesitate to charge sales tax. Although some states are looking into the missing taxes, others have yet to make an effort to solve the problem; until every affected state starts cracking down, Amazon's marketplace will continue to have a price advantage over competitors. If President Trump were to make a push for tougher online sales taxes nationwide, it could give him his desired result of a weakened Amazon.  Meanwhile, the company is still selecting the location for its second headquarters, and has fielded bids that could further shield it from taxes. Amazon has received a number of bids that feature tax breaks, the ability to keep its employees' income taxes, and likely much more, all of which would make it easier for Amazon to pay less in taxes. While these deals would be valuable to Amazon, the potentially extreme level of tax immunity they provide may lead to public backlash, which could bring on new regulations and laws that would hurt the company.", "stock": "AMZN", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-29", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-how-president-trump-could-go-after-amazon-2018-3"}, {"article": "Amazon Web Services CEO Andy Jassy Amazon  Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing division of Amazon, saw major gains in fourth quarter 2017 earnings Thursday as the tech giant tighens its lead in the cloud wars.

Walmart is now price matching Amazon on 53% of all online products, according to data from e-commerce analytics firm Profitero, reported on by Retail Dive.  Moreover, Target is matching 37% of its products to Amazon's prices, while Jet.com is matching 35%. But, even with competitors' price-matching attempts, Amazon remains a cost leader, as its prices are 10% lower than all retailers' on average.  Walmart has been pushing to undercut Amazon, and its recent efforts have been a success.  Walmart closed the gap on pricing differences with Amazon by the end of 2017, averaging only .3% higher than Amazon from December 2016 to November 2017, down from 3% higher for the same period in the previous year. The retailer has also been using tactics, such as pickup discounts, to help customers save money on online orders.  Walmart's in-store prices are lower than the e-commerce titan's by 10.4% on average. Noteably, Walmart dominated in home goods and kitchen appliances, undercutting Amazon by 33% and 21%, respectively.  But competing on price may hurt the retailer's efforts to increase margins on online orders. Walmart requested that vendors offer more products priced at $10 or above in an effort to avoid taking a loss on shipping small orders. However, this move may counteract the price-matching efforts it's been making, especially among consumers who aren't brand-loyal, as online shoppers may turn to retailers that have a large assortment of low-priced items to shop from.  Walmart could see more success by offering an array of items under $10, but requiring that they be an \"add-on\" to a larger order. This would allow shoppers to get the low-priced items they're looking for, while increasing margins on shipping online orders for Walmart.  These price wars are likely to have a ripple effect across the entire retail industry, as Amazon ramps up efforts across all segments. Amazon is already stealing apparel sales from retailers, with its pricing and discounts being a major attraction to consumers. Apparel retailers are feeling the effect of this, as they struggle to move inventory and are forced to significantly markdown items. Meanwhile, the grocery segment has been fiercely competing to have the cheapest goods after Amazon entered the space via its acquisition of Whole Foods. But, as Amazon pushes its own brands, it is unlikely that any segment will be immune to the price war.", "stock": "AMZN", "label": -1, "date": "2018-04-06", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/the-retail-price-wars-are-intensifying-2018-4"}, {"article": "BI Intelligence  This story was delivered to BI Intelligence \"E-Commerce Briefing\" subscribers hours before appearing on Business Insider.

Many apparel shoppers are shifting their spending away from retailers like Target and Macy's, and toward Amazon, according to a study from Coresight Research emailed to Business Insider Intelligence.  The study found that Amazon already has a significant presence in apparel, with 46% of respondents saying they made an apparel purchase from the e-tailer in the past year. And that percentage is set to grow, as 48% expect to make an apparel purchase from Amazon in the next year.  Amazon is stealing apparel sales from big-box retailers and department stores alike.  More than 30% of Target shoppers have switched some of their apparel spending to Amazon. This high overlap makes sense because Amazon and Target are top destinations for apparel. However, Target apparel shoppers reported being more likely to shop on Amazon for apparel, and to have a Prime membership, than Walmart's customers. This puts Target and Amazon in direct competition for consumers. But both parties appear to be ready to compete, as they've been beefing up their rosters of private-label apparel brands.

Consumers are spending less of their apparel budget at Macy's, and Amazon is the most popular recipient of those lost sales, according to another Coresight Research study.Of the 26% of consumers who said they spend less on apparel at Macy's than they did three years ago, over 42% said they've switched that spending to Amazon \u2014 which is more than any other retailer. This shows that Amazon is making a dent in department stores' performance, even though it may lack the stores and prestige of its competitors.  Pricing and discounts appear to be a major draw for Amazon in apparel. Forty-nine percent of apparel shoppers said they go to Amazon because it offers good value, displaying that pricing is key for Amazon in the industry. This may hinder Amazon's ability to succeed in luxury fashion, as its low-price image may not be so appealing then, but it appears to be aiding its apparel efforts overall.  Prime subscriptions may be the key for Amazon as it tries to steal customers away.Prime subscribers were much more likely to have shopped for apparel on Amazon, and to plan on doing so going forward, than nonsubscribers. This means that Amazon will have to work as hard as other retailers for non-Prime subscribers, making it even more important for Amazon to grow Prime's subscriber base. However, the number of Prime subscribers who are expecting to shop on Amazon for apparel dipped slightly from the number who made purchases last year, meaning that Amazon may need to evaluate what is causing it to lose apparel customers.

Amazon has been hiring house cleaners because it's testing a new housekeeping service, dubbed Amazon Home Assistants, in its home city of Seattle, Bloomberg reports.  Amazon Home Assistants' workers can help customers with tasks like cleaning, laundry, and more, and the service has been generally well reviewed by customers so far.  Hiring its own employees and creating its own unique service is a new approach for Amazon in the housekeeping space.  Amazon launched Amazon Home Services in 2015, which is a marketplace where independent contractors can offer their services under the Amazon Home Services name. The program now offers services like help with home improvement, technology installations, and house cleaning. Despite the service's expansion to all 50 states, and Amazon's claim in 2016 that the market for home services was worth somewhere between $400 billion and $800 billion, Amazon Home Services' growth has been slow, according to Bloomberg, possibly leading to the new program.  Amazon Home Assistants targets a smaller market than Home Services: US consumers were estimated to have spent $16 billion on housecleaning in 2017 by ServiceMaster Global Holdings Inc., as cited by Bloomberg. By directly employing its workers and having more control over the service, Amazon may find more success with this new offering.  Amazon Home Assistants could tie-in well with Amazon's efforts to improve package delivery security. Amazon recently launched its Amazon Key program, which uses smart technology to enable in-home deliveries even when customers aren't home.  The program aims to provide more secure deliveries, thus giving consumers more reasons to buy from Amazon. Home Assistants could help this secure-delivery initiative in two ways: Users without Amazon Key could authorize the assistants to accept packages, increasing their value and Amazon's delivery performance, or Amazon Key could make it possible for users to let the assistants into their homes without being present, incentivizing them to use Amazon Key.  The service may make consumers comfortable with Amazon having a pronounced presence in their homes, benefiting some of the company's other efforts. The e-commerce titan introduced its answer to Best Buy's Geek Squad last July through Smart Home Services by Amazon, offering consultations on what smart home products are best for consumers' homes as well as installations.  However, some consumers are uncomfortable with Amazon being in their living rooms all the time in the form of smart devices, likely hindering the service's success. With Home Assistants regularly in consumers' houses, they may be more apt to use Home Services and buy Amazon smart products, like the Echo, because Amazon will be a constant presence in their lives. This, in turn, could improve Amazon's standing in the smart home industry.", "stock": "AMZN", "label": 1, "date": "2018-04-03", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-tests-new-play-to-enter-customers-homes-2018-4"}, {"article": "BII  This story was delivered to BI Intelligence IoT Briefing subscribers hours before it appeared on Business Insider. To be the first to know, please click here.  Amazon's Alexa fund recently participated in a $62 million Series C funding round into 11-year-old smart home device manufacturer Ecobee, according to CNBC. The funding round was led by Energy Impact Partners.  The Toronto-based company primarily makes smart thermostats, but also sells sensor packages that can pair with the thermostats to help users manage hot and cold spots in their homes, and recently announced it will soon sell smart light switches. The Alexa fund, which Amazon launched back in late 2015, invests in third-party hardware companies and help them make their devices compatible with Alexa, or, in some cases, embed Alexa into their devices.  The Alexa fund was also one of the lead investors in the Series B round Ecobee completed back in 2016, and last year the device maker introduced a new thermostat that has Alexa embedded in it. This latest funding round brings the Ecobee's total funding to $146 million. Thomvest and Relay Ventures, two US-based venture firms, joined Amazon in leading the investment.  Amazon's investment comes shortly after it purchased video doorbell makers Ring and Blink, and considered buying smart lock maker August. The e-commerce titan is clearly interested in broadening its footprint in the smart home market, and likely hopes to leverage the immense popularity of its Echo smart speakers to get its users to purchase devices from companies it has acquired or invested in.  Its ongoing support of Ecobee suggests that the company is at least exploring the idea of adding smart thermostats, sensors, and light switches to its own product suite, which would allow it to build a more complete smart home ecosystem around the Echo products.  Ecobee's primary competitor in the smart thermostat space is Alphabet-owned Nest, and given that Amazon decided to stop selling Nest products through its marketplace last week, it will likely target Ecobee's devices at customers on its e-commerce site who otherwise might have purchased Nest products. Amazon may eventually look to purchase Ecobee outright the way it did with Blink and Ring, though it's unclear whether the younger firm is looking to sell.  Amazon, however, still faces an uphill battle in a fragmented market long plagued by slow growth. The company likely hopes that it can convince its loyalists and other mass-market consumers to buy smart home devices, ultimately growing the overall market. But the consumer IoT space has seen slow adoption, and many companies are struggling to turn a profit.  Meanwhile, Amazon will need to confront a fragmented market with legacy home device makers like GE and Honeywell, as well as Nest, which now has its own long line of smart home devices along with its flagship thermostats.  Amazon may struggle to turn a profit in this difficult market, but the company takes heavy losses in many other business segments, and likely finds the data it could collect on consumers' habits through its smart home devices an enticing incentive to compete. That data could be valuable for its core e-commerce business, as well as new initiatives like its recently reported package delivery service.  The US smart home market has still yet to meet the expectations many observers had in the early part of this decade.  The same issues BI Intelligence first identified back in 2015 still plague the space \u2014 persistently high prices, technological fragmentation, and consumers' lack of a perceived benefit from the devices.  But the newfound popularity of smart home voice control has revolutionized smart home ecosystems across the country, and convinces more consumers to equip their homes with smart devices on a daily basis. The Amazon Echo, released in 2014, has become immensely popular and capable, awakening users to the utility of both voice control and smart home devices. This has prompted companies to rush to release competing devices and integrate voice control into their smart home ecosystems.

From 2006 to 2010, Amazon operated in France using its subsidiary in Luxembourg. This way, the company could pay less taxes. But French authorities think French sales should be taxed in France. That\u2019s why they were asking for $252 million in unpaid taxes (\u20ac203 million).  Both Amazon and the French government didn\u2019t comment on the amount of the fine. It\u2019s possible that Amazon eventually paid less than $252 million.  According to the company, Amazon has created a subsidiary in France since then so that French revenue is taxed in France. So the Luxembourg issue shouldn\u2019t come up again.  The company also told the AFP that it has spent quite a bit of money in France. 5,500 people work for Amazon in France. Amazon has invested $2 billion in France in total.  It\u2019s interesting to see that tax authorities managed to avoid a public fight.

According to the AFP, we\u2019ll hear more about this new regulation in March 2018. Early drafts suggested that European tax authorities will look at overall revenue and not just profit.  For instance, if a big tech company such as Google, Amazon or Facebook reports $2 billion in revenue in Germany but only $10 million in profit, it doesn\u2019t add up \u2014 when you look at earnings report, you can see that tech companies have quite a big gross margin. So tax authorities will use the bigger figure to calculate fair taxes.  With that upcoming change and today\u2019s news, Google is probably relieved.

Today, Amazon is expanding the program again \u2013 this time, to kids skills.  This brings the number of skill categories that qualify for direct payments to eight, including Education & Reference, Food & Drink, Health & Fitness, Lifestyle, Music & Audio, and Productivity, in addition to Games and now, Kids.  Amazon also gave an update on how the program itself has been doing. While the company didn\u2019t release exact numbers, as per usual, it says it paid out \u201cmillions of dollars\u201d to developers in 22 countries, who have their skills published in the U.S., U.K., and Germany.  Some developers have even earned \u201ctens of thousands of dollars,\u201d and a few earned over $100,000, Amazon noted.

In finance world, when you hire an advisor who is a fiduciary \u2014 he\u2019s legally bound to put your financial interests ahead of his.  There are many paths to business success and financial models that go with it. You can make money directly from the end user or you can find an interested third party who\u2019s interests you serve \u2014 advertisers, financiers, CIOs, employers are often the real customers while the end user is reduced to a metric.  We are seeing this play out as ad driven businesses compete with the likes of Apple and Amazon . In B2B, companies that sell primarily to the CIO and procurement are competing with the new age of SaaS players that are often selling direct to the line of business or even the individual user.  What makes companies like Apple and Amazon unique?  Apple\u2019s business model relies almost entirely on revenue earned directly from the consumer. Even when you are buying 3rd party apps, you are buying them from Apple \u2014 and Apple ensures that they are safe, secure and work as advertised.  Amazon and Jeff Bezos are single mindedly focused on delivering value to the consumer \u2014 they too make their revenue and profits by selling directly to you. Recently, they have added other revenue sources like advertising but that is far from the dominant source of income.  Meanwhile, any company that earns its living primarily by charging some other third party \u2014 advertisers, brokers, etc. \u2014 is not a fiduciary. They may be incented to do the right thing for the consumer but at the end of the day they can often cut corners.  The Unbeatable Edge  As Apple enters markets like health and finance, they come in with the benefit of consumer\u2019s trust. It shows in their business model and it shows in their product \u2014 even technology architecture.  For example, the credit card you store in your Apple Wallet is never visible to Apple. They are applying a similar approach to your health data in the newly announced health records on your iPhone. They don\u2019t need to make money from the pharma companies or the hospitals. They serve your needs directly.  Since they make so much of their money from you by charging you for phones and additional apps and services, they don\u2019t need to sell or even use your data for businesses that are not aligned with the end users.  Trillion Dollar SaaS Market  The massive shift to SaaS can be viewed from the technology lens of multitenancy and serverless but at the core of the move to SaaS is the ability for the end user or line of business to directly buy the apps it needs.  The legacy on premise vendors built products focused more on the needs of the CIO and the needs of the business were often poorly served. Companies like Salesforce and Workday sold directly to the line of business changing the game forever.  Netflix and TV  When viewed through the fiduciary lens, you realize why Netflix is so powerful \u2014 every person in the company is focused on delivering entertainment to you the subscriber. There are no advertisers and no cable company middlemen dictating what they think is good for the consumer.  An ad free business is not just great TV, it aligns incentives in unique ways that create a moat that\u2019s hard to beat.  The Next Generation of Fiduciary Companies  As we look to the next generation of startups, here are some companies whose business model is well aligned with the end users.  AirbBnB : makes money when both renter and host are happy over the long term. Unlike Expedia and Priceline, that serve some very large customers and have a somewhat transactional relationship with the consumer.  : makes money when both renter and host are happy over the long term.

The rise of Lyft was enabled by Uber\u2019s missteps on this alignment and how it treated its drivers. Wealthfront: With a transparent fee structure, and no under the cover fees, Wealthfront is to the younger generation what Vanguard was the last \u2014 one of the few financial services company that is truly honest and aligned with the users.  Challenges  No business model is isolated from misuse and abuse. Even with the fiduciary model, companies are often putting someone else\u2019s interest ahead of yours \u2014 their own. One could easily argue that the closed content ecosystem of Apple and Amazon Alexa are examples of the companies maximizing their own self-interest.  What should a founder do?  When you are starting a company and want to build something for the long term, take the time to think through who your actual customer is vs the user. The more aligned the person writing the check is with the needs of your end user the better.

This acquisition makes plenty of sense. Amazon has already built a few connected cameras of its own \u2014 but hardware is, as they say, hard, and that\u2019s not going to change. With nearly a dozen solid products to its name, the Ring team has proven themselves more than capable of building hardware (and I\u2019m sure its array of patents doesn\u2019t hurt, either.)

(Amazon does love its acronyms.)  Private certificates let you limit exactly who has access, giving you more control and hence greater security over them.

The resulting audio can be played from within the blog post itself, or accessed in podcast form using a feature called Amazon Pollycast, the company says.  The plugin itself was jointly designed by Amazon\u2019s AWS team and managed WordPress platform provider WP Engine, and takes advantage of Amazon\u2019s text-to-speech service, Polly.  First introduced at Amazon\u2019s re:Invent developer event back in November 2016, Polly uses machine learning technologies under the hood to deliver more life-like speech. For example, Polly understands that the word \u201clive\u201d would be pronounced differently based on its usage. In the phrases \u201cI live in Seattle\u201d and \u201cLive from New York,\u201d the word is spelled the same but is not spoken in the same way. That means the voices sound more natural than some other, more basic voice-to-text engines.  The Polly speech engine launched with 47 male and female voice and support for 24 languages. Since then, Amazon added support for Korean, another 5 languages, and made Polly available in all regions in the AWS partition.  The technology\u2019s capabilities have also evolved, with added support for things like whispering, speech marks, a timbre effect, and dynamic range compression. These sorts of voice technology advancements are also things that make Alexa sound more natural, too. Similar to Polly, Alexa learned how to whisper and change the pitch of her voice earlier this year.  The launch of the WordPress plugin is not the first time Polly has been used to turn digital text to speech, of course. The service itself has always been capable of turning any text \u2013 news articles, blog posts, RSS feeds, PDFs, and more \u2013 into audio. However, making this functionality available as a WordPress plugin makes Polly more accessible to a wider audience.  However, the plugin is only available to anyone running their own installation of WordPress on their own infrastructure (hosted or managed) or on AWS, and does require a bit of configuration. That may make it a bit more challenging for less technical types to use. (Instructions are here on the Amazon developer blog and on the plugin\u2019s page.)  Once set up, the plugin makes calls to Amazon Polly whenever a blog post is saved or updated.  In addition to simply reading posts aloud, Polly\u2019s flexibility means you could configure different voices for different bylines, or use different voices for quoted text \u2013 if you\u2019re technically-minded \u2013 these options aren\u2019t available in the plugin itself. (Users can choose from the full selection of Amazon Polly voices to narrate different bylines using the plugin. However, they can\u2019t have different voices in the same reading.)  For podcasters, the plugin includes a feature called Pollycast that lets you control the iTunes parameters that are in the generated RSS feed, like the iTunes category, image, contact email, and explicit content flag.  The Amazon Polly plugin is free, but using Polly is not.  Pricing is based on the number of characters in the speech requests. It\u2019s also worth noting the AWS free tier allows up to 5 million characters per month at no charge for the first year after you begin to use Polly.", "stock": "AMZN", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-08", "source": "techcrunch", "url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/02/08/amazon-launches-a-polly-wordpress-plugin-that-turns-blog-posts-into-audio-including-podcasts/"}, {"article": "One of the primary advantages of cloud computing has always been the ability to scale up to meet short-term needs and scale back when that need has been met. In other words, you don\u2019t have to pay for infrastructure that you don\u2019t need to hedge against heavy usage. That has mostly meant server capacity, but over time it has been applied to other cloud services. Now, developers can configure auto scaling across a set of AWS services in a single unified interface.  Companies typically use multiple AWS services to build their applications, and up until now that required some work to make sure the various pieces were scaling as the application required it. In a company blog post announcing the new feature, Amazon\u2019s Jeff Barr explained how the new service greatly simplifies auto-scaling for developers.  \u201cYou no longer need to set up alarms and scaling actions for each resource and each service. Instead, you simply point AWS Auto Scaling at your application and select the services and resources of interest. Then you select the desired scaling option for each one, and AWS Auto Scaling will do the rest, helping you to discover the scalable resources and then creating a scaling plan that addresses the resources of interest,\u201d Barr wrote in the blog post.  The new service gives developers a set of auto-scaling options, offering a way to balance cost, availability or a combination of the two, depending on your company\u2019s and the application\u2019s specific requirements. As you set up a given scaling threshold, AWS Auto Scaling actually can create a set of scaling policies automatically, based on your configuration.  The way it works is you select an application, then create a scaling configuration plan where you set scaling targets for each resource.

It helps arrange the transportation of freight across the ocean on cargo ships from Chinese suppliers. It has even taken a more direct role in delivering orders to customers through local couriers.  But Amazon also depends heavily on outside companies to deliver orders. The company\u2019s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, has said Amazon\u2019s business with carriers like UPS and the Postal Service is growing even as the company gets more involved.  Amazon\u2019s own shipping services have given the company a way to keep up with the growth in its business, which is especially helpful during times, like the holidays, when its carrier partners are flooded with packages. Operating its own shipping services could also offer a way to negotiate better prices with outside delivery companies. Shipping costs at Amazon last year rose 34 percent to $21.7 billion, according to Amazon filings.  Steve Gaut, a spokesman for UPS, declined to comment about Amazon\u2019s plans or whether the company\u2019s shipping volume with UPS had changed. He pointed out, however, that UPS reported 8 percent revenue growth and a 4.5 percent increase in package volume in the United States last year.  \u201cUPS continues to support Amazon and all other valued customers,\u201d he said.

Slowly over time, Amazon has added more and more features to the service, but they are still well short of the offerings from established providers like Microsoft.  \u201cI think Amazon is going to find different areas within the logistics and transportation space where it can be maybe more effective or efficient than what FedEx and UPS can do,\u201d Mr. Sebastian said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re trying to establish a full competitor.\u201d", "stock": "AMZN", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-09", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/09/business/amazon-delivery-service.html"}, {"article": "Additionally, in its latest annual report to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Amazon said it paid $957 million in income taxes in 2017. The company previously reported paying $412 million in income taxes in 2016, $273 million in 2015 and $177 million in 2014, according to the commission.  Those totals can include taxes that are paid on state, federal and foreign income \u2014 although the filing does not specifically break down the amounts for each.  An analysis published in February by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy concluded that Amazon did not pay any federal taxes in 2017. It cited the company\u2019s S.E.C. filing in concluding that Amazon took advantage of a variety of tax breaks and credits to avoid paying federal taxes.  Amazon and the Postal Service  Mr. Trump has also previously criticized the relationship between Amazon and the Postal Service. In December, the president denounced the agency on Twitter for losing billions of dollars when it could be \u201ccharging MUCH MORE\u201d to Amazon and other shippers.  It is true the Postal Service has consistently reported net losses for a decade; the last time it reported net income from its operations was the 2006 fiscal year. In the 2017 fiscal year, the agency reported a net loss of $2.7 billion; the previous three years, it incurred losses of nearly twice that amount.  The beginning of the 2018 fiscal year suggested the organization was not turning its fortunes around. In the first quarter, which included the December holiday season that typically brings its strongest earnings of the year, the Postal Service had a net loss of $540 million.  Those losses cannot be attributed to Amazon shipments alone, however, and the president\u2019s Twitter posts have lacked context. Notably, packages and shipping are areas of growth for the Postal Service that have offset its general shortfalls in revenue.

The Postal Service attributes much of its financial woe to a prolonged decline in the volume of marketing mail and first-class mail \u2014 bills, birthday cards and, for example, bridal shower invitations. Its mail business is still its \u201cmain source of revenue and contribution,\u201d the postmaster general, Megan J. Brennan, said in a statement in February.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  In large part because of the internet \u2014 online bill pay, Facebook birthday posts and e-vites \u2014 the volume of first-class mail being sent through the Postal Service has decreased 43 percent since 2001, when it last peaked.  Still, Mr. Trump\u2019s assertion that the Postal Service is leaving money on the table may have some truth to it. A 2017 analysis by Citigroup concluded that the agency was charging below market rates for package delivery.  If that is the case, Amazon, widely believed to be one of the Postal Service\u2019s biggest customers, certainly benefits.  The report estimated that if the agency increased its parcel rates, Amazon\u2019s shipping costs would rise by about $2.6 billion. Some of that money would presumably go to the Postal Service, which in 2014 handled 40 percent of Amazon\u2019s packages, according to one 2015 estimate.  The report also suggested that Amazon\u2019s high shipment volume gives it a greater opportunity to negotiate rates with shippers. Amazon has acknowledged in the past that it has an arrangement with the Postal Service, but it has rejected the idea that its shipments are being subsidized by the agency.  In a 2017 statement, Amazon said that its partnership with the Postal Service was \u201creviewed annually by the Postal Regulatory Commission,\u201d which found its contracts to be profitable.  The Postal Service\u2019s chief financial officer, Joseph Corbett, has also defended the agency\u2019s shipping rates. In a letter in July to The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Corbett wrote that the Postal Service\u2019s \u201ccompetitive package products, including those that we deliver for Amazon,\u201d are legally required to cover the costs incurred.  Amazon and The Washington Post  People close to Mr. Trump say that his disdain for Amazon (and, by association, for Mr. Bezos) is often set off by his anger at negative articles in The Washington Post.

Back in the United States, Walmart, the world\u2019s largest retailer, is testing out the Bossa Nova robots in dozens of its locations to reduce some tedious tasks that can eat up a worker\u2019s time. The robots, which look like giant wheeled luggage bags, roll up and down the aisles looking for shelves where cereal boxes are out of stock and items like toys are mislabeled. The machines then report back to workers, who restock the shelves and apply new labels.  At 120 of Walmart\u2019s 4,700 American stores, shoppers can also scan items, including fruits and vegetables, using the camera on their smartphones and pay for them using the devices. When customers walk out, an employee checks their receipts and does a \u201cspot check\u201d of the items they bought.  Kroger, one of the country\u2019s largest grocery chains, has also been testing a mobile scanning service in its supermarkets, recently announcing that it would expand it to 400 of its more 2,700 stores.  New start-ups are seeking to give retailers the technology to compete with Amazon\u2019s system. One of them, AiFi, is working on cashierless checkout technology that it says will be flexible and affordable enough that mom-and-pop retailers and bigger outlets can use it. In the United States, venture capitalists put $100 million into retail automation start-ups in each of the past two years, up from about $64 million in 2015, according Pitchbook, a financial data firm.

While such technologies could improve the shopping experience, there may also be consequences that people find less desirable. Retailers like Amazon could compile reams of data about where customers spend time inside their doors, comparable to what internet companies already know about their online habits.

Many Chinese citizens have become accustomed to high levels of surveillance, including widespread security cameras and government monitoring of online communications.

Walmart, the largest private employer in the United States, says that it does not anticipate automation will lead to job losses, but rather that the new technologies are meant to redirect employees to spend more time helping customers find what they need.  \u201cWe see this as helping our associates,\u201d said John Crecelius, vice president of central operations at Walmart. \u201cWe are a people-led business that is technology enabled.\u201d  Some traditional retailers are also skeptical about whether the sort of automation in Amazon Go can move to large stores.

Amazon has been so successful at attracting upper-income consumers that it increasingly needs to go elsewhere in search of growth, analysts said.

But Sucharita Kodali, an analyst at Forrester Research, a market research company, said a recent survey of shoppers by her firm had found that a majority of American households with annual income over $100,000 had Prime accounts. The membership rate falls off quickly farther down the income scale, she said.  There are a number of reasons that low-income consumers have been less avid online shoppers, including the fact that many do not have credit cards. Some may not have secure places to receive packages.  \u201cThey are still getting used to the idea of shopping online,\u201d Ms. Kodali said.  Amazon has tried to address some of these obstacles. Amazon Cash, for example, allows people to add money to their Amazon accounts by taking cash to CVS pharmacies, GameStops and other retail locations. Amazon Lockers, installed outside convenience stores and other locations, give people a secure place to pick up and return Amazon packages.  Amazon said people can sign up for the discounted Prime membership by going to the company\u2019s website and uploading an image of their Medicaid or E.B.T. cards. Like other new Prime subscribers, they can do a free trial of the service for 30 days.  Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank, said Amazon\u2019s move was clearly a grab for a portion of Walmart\u2019s customers.

The e-commerce giant has cut the field of candidates to 20 prime locations to complement its Seattle base, including Atlanta, Dallas and New York. Hundreds of cities hoped Amazon would think outside the box, but a desire for talent and a welcoming environment led it to the usual hot spots.  The company, led by Jeff Bezos, started the process in typically innovative fashion in September by issuing an unusual and very public request for proposals. Fully 238 localities in the United States, Canada and Mexico submitted bids, lured by the prospect of $5 billion in investment and a promised 50,000 jobs with compensation averaging over $100,000 each.  Distressed cities like Detroit and Hartford marshaled civic and business leaders to make their cases, seeing the investment as a chance to transform their economic prospects. New Jersey\u2019s former governor Chris Christie dressed up Newark\u2019s bid with $7 billion in potential tax breaks. The contest even prompted the mayor of Stonecrest, an Atlanta suburb, to rename the town Amazon and make Mr. Bezos mayor for life if he chose the town.  With the exception of Newark, most have come away empty-handed. That\u2019s not a surprise given Amazon\u2019s criteria of a large metropolitan area, a strong pool of technical talent, a business-friendly environment and good transportation links. But it\u2019s disappointing that with the exception of a couple of outsiders like Indianapolis and Columbus, Ohio, the company\u2019s finalists \u2014 which also include Austin, Tex., Boston, Los Angeles, Toronto and the suburbs of Washington \u2014 are just about everyone else\u2019s, too.

Ms. Bowser said Amazon\u2019s selection of Montgomery County and Northern Virginia \u2014 both near Washington \u2014 spoke to the appeal of the region\u2019s work force.  \u201cOf course,\u201d she added, \u201cwe believe that Washington, D.C. \u2014 with our top talent and world-class amenities \u2014 is the right place for Amazon HQ2.\u201d  Mayor Baraka said that Newark has a \u201cfriendly rivalry\u201d with its bigger neighbor, New York, while adding that his city enjoys the advantages of cheaper real estate, space for development in its downtown and lots of fiber optic network capacity.  Photo  Amazon needs a second headquarters because it\u2019s bursting at the seams in its hometown, Seattle. Mr. Bezos founded the company there in 1994, and it has since transformed the city, employing more than 40,000 there. That expansion has also contributed to Seattle\u2019s soaring cost of living and its traffic woes.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  To lure applicants, Amazon showered local politicians with its own data about the effect the company has had on the Seattle economy, and some of the immediate economic benefits its second home would experience \u2014 including $5 billion in construction spending.  It asked candidates to include in their bids a variety of detailed information, including potential building sites, crime and traffic stats and nearby recreational opportunities. Amazon also asked cities and states to describe the tax incentives available to offset its costs for building and operating its second headquarters. The most eye-popping of those offers was New Jersey\u2019s promise of up to $7 billion in tax incentives to bring Amazon to Newark.  Another tech giant, Apple, this week said it, too, was hunting for a location to build a major new campus. But the company\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, said it would not conduct a public bidding process akin to Amazon\u2019s. He said California and Texas were unlikely locations for the new campus because Apple already has significant operations there.  Amazon\u2019s search process has also attracted critics. Stacy Mitchell, co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a nonprofit organization that serves as an advocate for local businesses, said that politicians were enhancing Amazon\u2019s image just as the company\u2019s market power was under growing scrutiny from groups like her own.  \u201cAs these cities woo and grovel, they are basically communicating this idea that we should want Amazon to be bigger and more powerful in our economy,\u201d Ms. Mitchell said.  Ed Glaeser, a professor of economics at Harvard who studies cities, predicted that the winner of the contest would have in place the kind of positive economic attributes that mean it wouldn\u2019t necessarily need Amazon to thrive.  \u201cAt its best, the competition for Amazon has spurred cities to think about how to improve their quality of life more generally,\u201d he said. \u201cAt its worst, the competition has become a distraction and a contest for throwing cash at the giant.\u201d", "stock": "AMZN", "label": 1, "date": "2018-01-18", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/18/technology/amazon-finalists-headquarters.html"}, {"article": "How that infatuation developed is the story of a company that figured out how to tame Wall Street. In a business environment that demands, and rewards, quarterly profits and short-term strategic thinking, Amazon showed extraordinary resolve in focusing on long-term goals, somehow persuading investors to go along.  Over its first decade in existence, including long stretches where it consistently reported losses, Amazon enjoyed a luxury afforded few companies: leeway.  \u201cI think it comes down to a consistent message and consistent strategy, one that doesn\u2019t deviate when the stock goes down or goes up,\u201d said Bill Miller, the chief investment officer at Miller Value Partners, whose largest holding is Amazon.  In part, Amazon has inured itself to pressure from Wall Street by ignoring it. While many chief executives devote significant time to fielding questions from investors, Amazon\u2019s founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos, is famously stingy about the time he spends with major stockholders. He hasn\u2019t appeared on an Amazon earnings calls in years.  In a 2014 interview with Business Insider, Mr. Bezos said he spent a measly six hours a year on investor relations and then only with long-term shareholders, who have been willing to weather the company\u2019s ups and downs. Mr. Miller is one of them.  Mr. Bezos has constantly reminded the market of his philosophy. Each year in the company\u2019s annual letter to shareholders, Amazon attaches a copy of the very first letter from 1997, its first as a publicly traded company.  Photo  \u201cWe will continue to make investment decisions in light of long-term market leadership considerations rather than short-term profitability considerations or short-term Wall Street reactions,\u201d Mr. Bezos wrote in a section of the letter titled, \u201cIt\u2019s All About the Long Term.\u2019\u2019  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Mr. Bezos has been true to his word. Amazon has reported an annual profit in only 13 of the 21 years that it has operated as a publicly traded company, according to FactSet, a financial data firm.  And its profit margins, already low by some measures, have fluctuated from year to year \u2014 hardly moving in the straight upward line that Wall Street usually likes to see.  Yet investors have rewarded Amazon for plowing its profits back into growing its businesses, whether in online retail, cloud computing or, most recently, in grocery stores, with the acquisition of Whole Foods Market.  An Amazon spokesman declined to comment.  It may sound like a Pollyanna view of stock investing, particularly in a market increasingly dominated by trading algorithms and macro bets on the direction of interest rates. But in the case of Amazon, it is actually true.  \u201cIf Wall Street would allow more companies to reinvest like Amazon, it would create great benefits for the economy,\u201d said Henry Blodget, a former stock analyst, who first came to prominence in 1998 by setting a $400 price target for Amazon shares. (He is now editorial director of the online publication Business Insider, in which Mr. Bezos was an investor.)  The reality of the economy, however, is that most other companies are still playing by Wall Street\u2019s old rules, which demand consistent profit growth.

Last month, Kimberly-Clark, under pricing pressure from Amazon and Walmart, said it was laying off more than 5,000 workers and closing or selling 10 of its factories.  It wasn\u2019t always so easy for Amazon. During the tech boom of the late 1990s, Amazon was one of a number of promising tech start-ups that were losing money. But it showed the potential for longer term profit, as it moved from selling books into music and toys.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  But like the rest of the tech sector, Amazon\u2019s shares tumbled in 2000 and 2001 as investors began to wonder if these companies could ever make money. A young debt analyst at Lehman Brothers warned in June 2000 that Amazon might soon run out of cash, causing investors to worry about its survival.  Mr. Bezos had squirreled away enough capital to get through those dark days. But it took many years for investors who had been burned by the dot-com crash to give Amazon a second chance.  For long stretches from 2002 to 2006, Amazon\u2019s stock price languished, while it invested in researching and developing new technologies and businesses.  Photo  Mark Mahaney, a tech analyst at RBC Capital Markets, looked at the company\u2019s slipping profit margins during that period and warned investors to stay away.  Mr. Mahaney said he failed to realize \u201cthat all that spending on R.&D. was a bullish sign for the future.\u201d He has had a buy rating on the company for more than a decade.  Those long-term investments, which Amazon didn\u2019t detail at the time, eventually gave rise to some of the company\u2019s most profitable businesses, like its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services.  The success of the cloud computing business proved a tipping point. If investors allowed Amazon to spend time and money investing, patience would pay off.  Investors are now awaiting the payoff from Amazon\u2019s foray into groceries with its $13 billion acquisition of Whole Foods last spring. How it plans to integrate hundreds of brick and mortar stores with its core e-commerce business is far from clear.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  By now, Wall Street has been well trained to believe that Amazon has a strategy for Whole Foods and it will take time to carry it out.  \u201cWhat the market finally figured out is Amazon is extremely good at investing those dollars,\u201d said Mr. Miller, the investment officer at Miller Value Partners.  Ultimately, much of the investor confidence in Amazon reflects a belief in its future opportunity \u2014 what investors frequently call a company\u2019s \u201caddressable market.\u201d  For Amazon, the addressable market in retail is roughly $5 trillion in the United States and many times that globally, Mr. Miller said. And that\u2019s not even including the traditional information technology market that Amazon Web Services is attacking. \u201cI asked Jeff what the addressable market is for A.W.S.,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cHe just looked at me and said, \u2018Trillions and trillions.\u2019\u201d  Online spending represents less than 10 percent of total retail spending, and Amazon captures almost half of every dollar spent in online shopping by Americans.  Even Mr. Gillespie, the skeptic, acknowledges that Amazon is \u201coperating extremely well.\u201d But he questions whether years of low interest rates have helped inflate Amazon\u2019s value because investors are so starved for return, they are willing to overlook some of the risks.  Those risks, he said, include regulators deciding the company is growing too large or not paying its fair share in taxes.  \u201cPeople tend to assume away these things,\u201d he said.", "stock": "AMZN", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-04", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/04/technology/amazon-asked-for-patience-remarkably-wall-street-complied.html"}, {"article": "Lindsay Walters, a White House spokeswoman, told reporters on Thursday that \u201cthe president has expressed his concerns with Amazon. We have no actions at this time.\u201d  Still, Mr. Trump\u2019s willingness to again single out Amazon and characterize it as a tax cheat and a job killer is a remarkable use of the presidential bully pulpit that could have serious implications for the company even without any formal moves by the federal government.  His comments have already spooked investors, sending Amazon stocks tumbling Wednesday after an article on the website Axios about his anger toward the company. The stock fell further after his tweet on Thursday, though prices rebounded later.  The tech industry is increasingly on the defensive. Facebook is under attack in Washington for its handling of personal data and the social network\u2019s role in the 2016 election. And the recent death of a pedestrian by a self-driving car has renewed criticism of Uber.  \u201cThe general principle that I know deeply concerns the president is that we need to live in a world where the government sets a level playing field between internet vendors and mom and pop stores,\u201d Kevin Hassett, the chair of the president\u2019s council on economic advisers, said Thursday on Fox Business.  Drew Herdener, an Amazon spokesman, declined to comment.  Several current and former officials said that Mr. Trump regularly conflates Amazon with The Post. Mr. Bezos owns the paper privately, separate from his role at Amazon.  Brad Parscale, the president\u2019s 2020 campaign manager, on Thursday channeled Mr. Trump\u2019s anger about The Post in a tweet of his own, saying: \u201cDo not forget to mention that @amazon has probably 10x the data on every American that @facebook does. All that data and own a political newspaper, The @washingtonpost. Hmm\u2026\u201d  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  And far-right, conspiracy-fanning websites \u2014 some of which Mr. Trump is known to read \u2014 have for months stoked the idea that The Post is in cahoots with the C.I.A. because the agency contracts with Amazon to provide cloud-based data storage. Last November, a headline at one of those sites, Infowars, said: \u201cBEZOS & DEEP STATE UNITE: AMAZON LAUNCHES CLOUD SERVICE FOR CIA.\u201d  The Post declined to comment.  One person close to Mr. Trump, who asked for anonymity to discuss private discussions in the Oval Office, said that the president mused about the issue of Amazon and taxes at least a half-dozen times in the last six months. The president has repeatedly claimed that Amazon costs the Postal Service money even though officials have explained to him that is not the case. Amazon has said that the Postal Regulatory Commission, which oversees the service, has consistently found that its contracts with Amazon are profitable.  People close to Mr. Trump say the president is convinced that Amazon unfairly benefits from tax laws. The internet giant collects sales taxes on its own products in all 45 states that have one, but third-party vendors who sell products on the site often do not collect sales tax, a fact that rivals say is unfair. In addition, some municipalities complain that the company does not collect local taxes.  In April, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in an case on whether to allow states to impose sales taxes on all internet sales. Many observers believe the justices are poised to reverse its 1992 ruling that exempted online retailers with no physical presence in a state.

Mr. Trump hears the sales tax complaints frequently during visits with his wealthy friends at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, and in meetings at the White House, several aides and associates said. One person familiar with his thinking said that the president believes many of his core supporters are hurt when Amazon disrupts the local businesses where they live.  The president\u2019s critique is shared by some of his usual adversaries in the Democratic Party. Like many of Mr. Trump\u2019s wealthy Republican friends, Representative Keith Ellison, Democrat of Minnesota, has been critical of Amazon\u2019s growing power in the marketplace.  \u201cThe Trump administration should rein in giants like Amazon because they have an unfair stranglehold on the competition, not because the president has a personal feud with a company\u2019s C.E.O.,\u201d Mr. Ellison said in a statement on Thursday.  There was also some irony in the criticism coming from Mr. Trump, who has boasted about his dexterity in avoiding paying taxes. \u201cThis is the guy who said that not paying taxes \u2018makes me smart,\u2019\u201d said Matt Gardner, senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a nonpartisan research organization.  How the president could slow Amazon, beyond take to Twitter or complain about the company in speeches, is unclear.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  If Mr. Trump were to pressure the Justice Department to pursue antitrust enforcement action against Amazon, it would be a sharp break from tradition, experts say, because the White House has kept a far distance from those cases for decades.  \u201cIt would be a gross violation and abuse of our due process,\u201d said Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute.  But the president has repeatedly crossed lines that his predecessors have observed. In the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, he has pressured Justice Department officials to investigate his Democratic rivals and to abandon the investigation of himself and his associates.  AT&T and Time Warner have suggested Mr. Trump played a role in the Justice Department\u2019s decision to block the companies\u2019 $85.4 billion media merger. Makan Delrahim, the head of antitrust at the Justice Department, has said under oath in Congress that he would not allow the White House to impact his decisions over that merger or any other cases.  Mr. Trump also surprised antitrust experts with his swift decision to block Broadcom\u2019s merger with Qualcomm earlier this month, after a review by a government panel on foreign investments. The president has direct authority to block a merger with foreign companies that pose national security concerns.  Amazon has tried, through lobbyists and outside consultants, to meet with administration officials and members of Congress to counter arguments about the company\u2019s tax collection and its relationship with the Postal Service.  The size of company\u2019s lobbying staff has ballooned in recent years, according to public filings, focusing largely on drones, transportation, taxes and cybersecurity. It has hired antitrust consultants over the past year.  In 2015, shortly after Mr. Trump started his attacks against the company, Mr. Bezos joked on Twitter about sending the candidate into space on a rocket made by Blue Origin, a space exploration start-up Mr. Bezos owns.  But when Mr. Trump became the Republican nominee and then president, Mr. Bezos and Amazon stopped responding to his attacks, seeing little upside in a public quarrel with him, according to two people briefed on the decision. The people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the conversations were private, said that these days, Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets were more likely to prompt eye-rolling inside the company than any serious effort at crisis control.", "stock": "AMZN", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-29", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/29/us/politics/trump-amazon-taxes.html"}, {"article": "If you\u2019re asking us whether the Echo is a device you need, the answer is a firm no. But as geeks and early adopters of technology, we do like what it stands for. It\u2019s a mere party trick at times.  When they launched it in the US, Amazon's Echo devices were a revelation for everyone. They seemed like an essential step towards a home we've only seen in science fiction movies. A speaker that listens, understands and responds - wow!  It's been a few years now and the dust has settled. Amazon sells a whole host of these smart devices and three of these entered India last year.  But for any kind of AI, India is a different beast altogether. Smart as they might be, they are awfully dumb in India, or at least that's what I personally think.  It's been months since I first ordered my Echo Dot, and just about a month with the Echo. And as one of the first Indian customers to own one of these devices, I can honestly say I love it. Yet, I also have to admit that it's a device that raises more questions than it answers.  Using the Echo  The larger Echo Plus is the most powerful of Amazon's three offerings here. But the biggest difference between that and the Echo is that the latter controls smart homes. I don't need that because the lights and appliances in my home are surely dumb.  So, I have an Echo. A cylindrical, fairly sleek speaker that can speak. It plays music when I tell it to, reads the news if I want, even tries to book an Uber for me and get me restaurant recommendations. Neat.  I bought the Echo Dot first and I was in awe in the first few days of using it. The accent was Indian, it recognised my voice without fail and had me do things I never thought I needed. But those were the initial days and the novelty wore off rather quickly.  With the Echo, you basically get better audio quality than the Dot, which is essential for those buying this as a speaker rather than a smart device.  But if you're buying this as a speaker first, you aren't using its strengths. This is the second generation Echo and it would work well for average listeners. Yet, it doesn't sound as good as the (similarly priced) UE Wonderboom. Bass-heavy songs are somewhat underwhelming, while high and mid frequencies aren't very well defined either.  As a portable speaker, the Echo does the job for regular listeners. But if you're used to the kind of speakers I mentioned above, the 2.5\" (downfiring) woofer and 0.6\" (upward firing) tweeter aren't enough.  Amazon never meant for this to be an audio device in the first place. It's all about the AI inside. In the nearly four months that I've used it, Alexa has understood my commands 80% of the time, better than Siri has ever done for me, and up to the standards set by the Google Assistant.  But here's the thing, in the last two months, all I've ever told Alexa to do is \"Play Music\". Nowadays, I actually play music over Bluetooth and use my voice only to \"stop\" or \"increase volume\". Amazon added 12,000 skills to Alexa (in India) since October, but nothing that I really need. You can check out our selection of the best Alexa Skills in our comprehensive rundown.  For instance, when I try to book an Uber, Alexa insists on it being a cash trip, even though my payment information is neatly set up inside the Uber app.  When I ask for a podcast, Alexa returns the voice equivalent of a blank face, because the functionality is apparently not available in India. Somehow, I can still play podcasts from Tune In manually, though.  Next, I ask Alexa to play a song and it confidently plays some cover of the song instead. It reads the news in a monotonous robotic voice, severely reducing the number of news sources I can choose from, and so on. Also, I can't just ask for news from one news source yet, it will play my entire news briefing whenever I do. That's one of the features available overseas, but not in India.  Oh, and the most annoying, when I say \"Alexa, play music\", it plays the same few playlists again and again. I try refining my search by saying \"Alexa, play Blues\", but that doesn't really get me very far either. I always end up having to resort to my phone.  There's one last case I'd point out. I told Alexa to order an item \"I usually order\". The AI successfully recognised what I order, but instead of ordering it to the address I usually get delivery on, it decided my default address is the way to go. An unusually dumb thing for a \"smart\" assistant to do. Why can Amazon read my order, but not recognise my behaviour?  So it's bad?  All that I have just mentioned makes the Echo a device I do not need. You know what though? It's a device I really want. Over the past four months, I've developed the habit of playing a podcast when I go to bed, asking for a song when I wake up and asking for weather updates when I get out. Things I never did earlier, with my dumb speakers. I don't regret buying the Echo Dot. It adds some much-needed smarts to my dumb Harman Kardon Soundsticks III.  Connecting to Bluetooth is much smoother with Alexa. I just say, \"Alexa, connect to Bluetooth\". I really appreciate not having to pick up my phone to skip a song (when I'm playing over Bluetooth). I could go on.  What I'm really saying is, you have to be a geek like me to even think of buying the Echo in India. And even then, you should buy the Echo Dot and make your legacy system smarter. The Echo Dot is the smartest wireless dongle I've ever used and compared to all others, it's the most useful.  For the early adopters  In short, Echo speakers in India are early adopter devices. They are neither perfect nor useful. But Amazon's betting it can change your mind. Early adopters like me are giving the company the data it needs to improve, and Amazon's voice assistant has made a much better start in India than all its competitors (You listening, Apple?).  I wouldn't even expect regular improvements here. Frankly, I'm a little annoyed that India still doesn't have an Amazon Music app. It would have been so much easier to create my own playlists and just direct Alexa to them. I've actually created a library of 50-60 odd songs using my voice alone, but it's tedious.  Does Alexa learn?  For Amazon, it's important that Alexa learns. That's how the company will know what products you're likely to buy. So, it's inevitable that Alexa will learn eventually, failing which, it will die. But I've seen no real signs of learning over the past four months.  Amazon has set up Indian versions of Alexa to play Indian tracks when you ask for music. But, it took Alexa about two days to recognise that I listen to western music more. Now, when I request music, the AI starts with an English playlist. If I say I don't like the playlist it chose, it goes to another, shuffling about four playlists before telling me to listen to Karan Johar songs.  While that is indeed a sign of intelligent learning, you will realise it's not. What I found over time, is that if I say \"Play music\", Alexa just cycles through a pre-selected collection of playlists, coming full circle quickly. A particularly annoying aspect that makes me just play music over Bluetooth all the time.  Amazon may have added a bunch of skills over time, but this particular aspect of Alexa is particularly worrisome. Perhaps the company is just working out the bugs before it can start \"learning\".  Speaking to the Echo  My bedroom is small, so I never have to raise my voice for commands. My indoor voice works just fine. But, I keep the Echo close to my TV, and it often fails to pick up the wake word (Alexa) when the TV is playing at above average volumes. This can be a problem if you're using the Dot as a dongle though. Unless you have an exceedingly long AUX cable, the Dot would be quite close to your speakers, and will hence fail to hear you when playing loud music. This only happens at really loud volumes though, something few would face.  I've successfully barked commands to Alexa from my kitchen, on occasion. The seven far field mics that both the Echo and Echo Dot have, pick up your voice quite easily.  Setting up the Echo  The easiest part of using the Echo devices is setting them up. The initial Wi-Fi connection takes a few minutes, but you never have to touch settings after that. After downloading the Alexa app, you put your Echo on pairing mode and connect to WiFi, and that's that.  Build and Design  The Echo is short and fat, wrapped in a similar fabric (you don't get the wood versions in India yet) as Google's Daydream VR. It's reasonably pretty and I don't think it will hamper the style quotient of any media centre. And though it's not meant to be portable, it's light enough to carry around in a pinch.  Our Verdict  If you're asking me whether the Echo is a device you need, the answer is a firm no. But, the geek in me really does like this device. It's nowhere close to being powerful in India yet and is meant only for the early adopters, who've been saving money ever since this first launched overseas. The Echo Dot is good for turning a dumb speaker smart, but that's about all I can say about the Echo line.", "stock": "AMZN", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-06", "source": "techradar", "url": "http://www.techradar.com/reviews/amazon-echo-india"}, {"article": "Xiaomi Redmi 4  The best entry level phone to buy, the Xiaomi Redmi 4 gives you the best value at the cheapest price. It has a solid built and a punchy display that makes up for the fact that it runs on Android Marshmallow. You'd be hard pressed to find a better option for less than 10k.  Moto G5S Plus  The full metal shell goes a long way to prove the durability of the Moto G5S Plus and the battery life is commendable. But since it's a budget phone, it's not perfect. The apps may crash on you from time to time and there's significant shutter lag.  To its credit, the phone has dual camera capabilities and runs on stock Android, which has always been a crowd favorite.  Xiaomi Redmi Note 4  If you're looking to spend a little more than the bare minimum, then the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 isn't a bad choice. It has a decent display, great battery life and adequate performance. Overall, it's a solid phone for the budget consumer.  OnePlus 5T  This phone offers flagship performance for the mid-range user. Running on Android Nougat out of the box, the OnePlus 5T sports a great design and built.  Even with an increase in the size of the display, battery life isn't compromised and the fingerprint sensor is a delight to use. It's special because of its face unlock feature that comes with the OxygenOS.  Honor View 10  If any phone can compete against the OnePlus 5T, then it's the Honor View 10. The camera may not match up but all the other features compete head to head.  It's great for users looking for a high end experience without having to empty their pockets.  Samsung Galaxy S8  The Samsung Galaxy S8 is easily one of the best phones in the market, despite it's Bixby feature being a little pointless. But if you're paranoid about your phone's security and don't mind jumping through a few extra hoops to have access, this phone is ideal.  Once you're in, the phone doesn't fail to impress with a design that's to die for along with an exceptional display. Battery life maybe questionable, but between the battery management options and power saving techniques, you'll get through a day of normal usage.  Samsung Galaxy Note 8  Another phone by Samsung, the Galaxy Note 8 is not only one of the more expensive phones but also considerably larger. The unique selling point of this phone is its 'Infinity Display' and the S-Pen to boost productivity.  The 6GB of RAM ensures that you have a smooth experience and the dual camera captures images that you won't soon forget.  Google Pixel 2 XL  The Google Pixel 2 XL may be a little pricey for the casual user but it has the best camera in comparison to any other phone. Its interface, made by Google, is exclusively designed for Pixel phones.  It's big. It's powerful. It will make you go 'WOW'.  Apple iPhone X  The Apple iPhone X has a great screen and it's TrueDepth camera is definitely something to be taken into account. True Apple fans will claim that this is the update they were waiting for but some may find it's price to off putting since it's one of the most expensive phones in the market.  It's unique because it's so different from all the other Apple phones with its premium design, impeccable display, extra power and all-screen front - a true delight.", "stock": "AMZN", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-15", "source": "techradar", "url": "http://www.techradar.com/news/best-smartphones-on-amazon"}, {"article": "The Amazon Echo Spot is the best-looking Echo product out there: a versatile, Alexa-toting video device that wants to be in your bedroom, your kitchen, your office...  Amazon\u2019s latest Echo refresh has brought with it a design flourish that was sorely missing from its original line-up.  We\u2019ll get straight to it: the Amazon Echo Spot is the best-designed Alexa device Amazon has ever created; it\u2019s a gadget you\u2019d happily have in your bedroom, on your desk, in your kitchen.  The new form factor makes Alexa feel fresh again, giving the voice AI some much-needed purpose.  The Amazon Echo Spot is versatile - it doesn\u2019t have a chameleon-like ability to adapt to the room you put it in but this is certainly not just a smart alarm clock, something Amazon has been very clear about.  Design  The issue is, it looks like a smart alarm clock which means that this may become its default use for many, but its use stretches beyond that.  The Amazon Echo Spot is unlike any other Echo device and that is a good thing. Its curved shell does more than enough to make up for its sibling\u2019s design failings.  Where the big, bulky and brash Amazon Echo Show took over any area you put it in, no thanks to its brutalist black slab look, the Echo Spot is much more refined in its design.  Surprisingly it turns out the best way to do a desk-based video device is to forgo the TV-lite look and just go with something that is compact and looks good.  The Echo Spot is a cross between an Echo Dot and a smaller version of the Amazon Show.  This is no Echo Dot replacement, though - the price puts it out of contention for that, and it\u2019s also a lot more useful, so to say it is would be doing it a disservice.  Size-wise, it\u2019s the equivalent of a mango. Mangos aren\u2019t the most scientific way to measure things, sure, but at least it gives you an indication that it\u2019s a pretty compact device with a curved back and screen that\u2019s angled up, which makes it easy to view.  It\u2019s a great-looking device, certainly something you won't mind having on show in your home unlike the, er, Show.  Features and setup  The unit we reviewed was black but there is also a white one available. The screen is small, at 2.5 inches (480\u00d7480 pixels).  On the top of the screen there is space for a camera and on the top of the device as a whole there are three buttons.  Anyone familiar with the Echo range will know what they are: volume up, down and mute for the mic - this will also disable the camera. There are also four small pin-prick holes. These house the four-array mics that listen out for the wake word.  On the back you have a nice bit of Amazon branding and a slot for power and a 3.5mm jack.  The speaker grill for the Spot is right at the base of the device, which makes it invisible when viewing the Spot face-on. Bluetooth functionality is also available.  Setup is similar to other Echo devices, except for this one you can type in your Wi-Fi details straight on the screen, instead of going through the Alexa app.  It\u2019s a little bit fiddly putting in your details that way (it will ask for your Amazon account password, too) but the whole process will take less than five minutes.  Once up and running, you have the option to watch Amazon\u2019s promo video which tells you what you can do with the device. It\u2019s not a masterpiece but it\u2019s worth sitting through so you get an idea just what you\u2019ve bought.  Then you get that warm chime sound, which means Alexa is up and running. Once this appears it\u2019s a good time to read our best Amazon Alexa Skills article or you could follow the prompts that come up on the screen. Or you can swipe right on the screen and that will bring up a whole load of Alexa commands you can use. It\u2019s a really nice way to learn what to do with Alexa. If you're looking for some fun and silly extras, give our Alexa Easter Eggs list a try, too.  These prompts can be turned off in the settings. It\u2019s in the settings where you can toggle home cards on an off also. The home cards are information that comes up on the home screen.  You can have the home screen include your messages, weather, notifications, upcoming events, reminders, drop in and trending topics.", "stock": "AMZN", "label": -1, "date": "2018-01-16", "source": "techradar", "url": "http://www.techradar.com/reviews/amazon-echo-spot"}, {"article": "Amazon is about to wrap up its ongoing Amazon Great Indian sale.

As of today, if you're paying the monthly rate for Amazon Prime in the US, expect to pay $12.99 during the next billing cycle beginning on February 18. That's an 18% hike from the previous price of $10.99.  The price increase also affects Amazon's monthly plan for students, which will also jump 18% from $5.49 to $6.49.  In a email to TechRadar, Amazon confirmed that the price hike only affects US customers.  Fortunately, the annual rate of $99 will stay the same, as will the standalone $8.99 monthly fee for Amazon Prime Video for those who wish to enjoy Amazon's video content without paying for the shipping and other perks.  Amazon didn't give a concrete reason for the price increase, and instead simply played up the appeal and wide range of services available through Amazon Prime in a prepared statement.  \"Prime provides an unparalleled combination of shipping, shopping and entertainment benefits, and we continue to invest in making Prime even more valuable for our members,\" an Amazon spokesperson said.  Amazon also pointed out that the number of items eligible for two-day shipping recently jumped from 20 million to 100 million, and it called attention to original viewing content on Prime Video such as \"the Golden Globe-winning The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\" and The Grand Tour.  Amazon Prime TV shows to watch today  Up we go  The last time Amazon Prime saw a price increase was in 2014, when the annual rate jumped from $79 to $99. The boost was seen as controversial at the time, but, as these things go, it's essentially been accepted as business as usual.  That's partly because Amazon introduced the new monthly plan that's now seeing the price increase a little under two years ago, offering greater flexibility to folks who just want to try out Prime for a while or don't have $99 to throw down all at once.

Earlier this week, the JioPhone was listed on MobiKwik, making it the first third party seller to sell the JioPhone. Before this, the JioPhone could be booked only from the MyJio app and the company\u2019s official website.  If you book the device from MobiKwik, you would have to go and collect the device from Reliance Digital but if you order the device from Amazon, the JioPhone will be delivered to your house. However, you will still have to go to Reliance Digital to get your device activated using your Aadhaar card.  To order the JioPhone, all you need to do is go to the product page and add the device to card. Then, make payment and once you receive the device, take the device and your Aadhaar card to your nearest Reliance Digital to activate your Jio connection.  The JioPhone is a 4G feature phone that was launched by Reliance Jio in July and went on sale online in August. The company started selling the device through its offline retailers in September. The device recently got its first third part app, Facebook.  JioPhone Specifications  To recall, the JioPhone comes with a 2.4-inch display, 1.2GHz dual core processor, 512MB RAM, 4GB internal storage, 2,000mAh battery and NFC support.

If you\u2019re already an Amazon Prime subscriber, then you will have full access to this service.  Initially, access to Amazon Music was restricted to Amazon Echo, the smart speaker line-up by the company. Now, it can be accessed via the Apple Store, Play Store as well as Amazon\u2019s online portal at music.amazon.in.  Amazon Music app interface  Once you log in to the app, it asks for your music preference. Options include Hindi, English, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Bhojpuri, Bengali, Gujarati and Rajasthani. After this, Amazon Music will curate the main screen, playlists and stations as per your selection.  In case you\u2019re an Echo device user, Amazon Music will able to integrate your playlists and albums in the \u2018recently played\u2019 section. Needless to say, the app can be synced to Alexa, Amazon\u2019s virtual personal assistant.  The app even gives you the option to choose the streaming quality, storage location and whether or not you want to use Wi-Fi (exclusively) for downloads. A nice little plug-in is the \u2018sleep timer\u2019. Choosing from a range of 15 minutes to 60 minutes, the app will will automatically switch off once that time is completed.  Subscription comparison  Amazon Music is a part of Amazon Prime, so it will cost Rs 999 per annum. This may sound expensive in bulk but essentially it comes up to Rs 83.25 per month. That\u2019s marginally cheaper than its competition with Apple Music costing Rs 120 per month and Google Play Music being Rs 99 per month. Apple Music does offer a student subscription, which would bring their cost down to Rs 60 per month, something the other two services do not offer.  As compared to Saavn and Gaana, Amazon music is still cheaper than Rs 1050 and Rs 1020, respectively for the two services.  It should be mentioned that if you have an Amazon Prime subscription, it gives you access to Prime Video and free express delivery options as well.  Content comparison  More important than the price, is the content collection. A service can be free but won\u2019t amount to much if it doesn\u2019t offer the music that you actually want to listen to.  Similar to the approach that Amazon took with Prime Video, Amazon\u2019s unique proposition is to focus on regional content. They have tie ups with labels like T-Series, Sony Music, Saregama, Zee Music, Venus Music and a host of other local entities to ensure that there isn\u2019t any shortage of regional music on the streaming service.  Amazon India hasn\u2019t made any statements about the volume of content that is available but internationally there are around 40 million songs included in the Amazon Music Unlimited subscription. Apple and Google also claim to have around 40-45 million tracks in their catalogue.", "stock": "AMZN", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-28", "source": "techradar", "url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/amazon-music-is-finally-in-india"}, {"article": "Amazon Prime isn\u2019t just life-changing because you can have all kinds of stuff delivered to your doorstep within 24 hours, it also allows you to stream TV shows and movies on demand.  Amazon\u2019s Prime Instant Video service has also been working on plenty of great, original content over the past few years, giving much of its licensed programming a run for its money and rivaling Netflix in the bid to be the top streaming service on the web.  So with that in mind, we\u2019re taking a good look at what\u2019s definitely on the cards over the next few months, as well as some of the latest speculations about the original content that will be on the way in the not-so-distant future, from a refresh of Conan The Barbarian, through to Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett\u2019s highly-anticipated Good Omens.  Carnival Row  Carnival Row looks like the stuff our dark fantasy dreams are made of, with fairies, mythical creatures and creepy killings all set against a backdrop of a neo-Victorian city called Burque. The show already has a star-studded cast with Cara Delevingne playing some kind of fairy and Orlando Bloom playing a police officer investigating a series of murders.  Paul McGuigan, best known for directing movies like Lucky Number Slevin and Push, will be at the helm of the new TV show, which will consist of ten episodes. Amazon hasn\u2019t released many more details yet, but production is expected to start in late 2018, with a 2019 release date reportedly on the cards.  When? 2019 (unofficially)  A sneak peek of John Krasinski as Jack Ryan (Image: \u00a9 Amazon Prime)  Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan  Readers in the US will have been treated to Amazon Prime Video\u2019s first ever ad during the Super Bowl in February 2018, which finally gave us a sneak-peek of the long-awaited Jack Ryan TV series, based on Tom Clancy\u2019s spy novels.  Starring The Office\u2019s John Krasinski, the series is slated to be ten episodes long and will be the first time FBI agent Jack Ryan appears in a TV show. But it\u2019s not the first time he\u2019s been portrayed on a screen. You\u2019ve probably come across Jack Ryan many times before without knowing it \u2013 Alec Baldwin played him in The Hunt For Red October, Ben Affleck played him in The Sum Of All Fears and so did Harrison Ford in Patriot Games.  When? August 2018 (unofficially)  The Lord of The Rings  We\u2019ve had our fingers crossed for a Lord of the Rings TV show for years, but it looks like it\u2019s now finally going to happen. After some speculation about which company would be taking the reins of Tolkien\u2019s fantasy saga, it\u2019s now official that Amazon has acquired the TV rights for The Lord of the Rings books with a multi-season deal.  There\u2019s been no official word about the stories that\u2019ll be told in the TV series, but at the time of the deal an Amazon spokesperson said in a press release that it would \u201cexplore new storylines preceding J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s The Fellowship of the Ring\u201d.  When? TBC  (Image: \u00a9 Amazon Prime)  The Tick Season 1 (Part B)  The Tick is an Amazon original series that aired its first six episodes back in 2017. In February 2018, the show is back to wrap up the first season, with Peter Serafinowicz starring as the big, blue Tick and Griffin Newman as his fluttering side-kick, Arthur.  The show\u2019s pilot episode received mixed reviews when it was first released in Summer 2016. But when the first half of the season was made available a whole year later, critics fell in love with the funny, gritty, and at times bizarre, superhero story adapted from The Tick comics, created by cartoonist Ben Edlund back in the 80s.  When? 23 February 2018  Conan  Crush your enemies! It\u2019s finally here! After lots of speculation, Deadline has reported that Amazon is currently working on a new drama called Conan, which is based on the books by Robert E. Howard.  The new show will have Colony co-creator Ryan Condal at the helm as the creator and writer, alongside Game of Thrones director Miguel Sapochnik. According to early reports, the show will focus on Conan\u2019s original story taken from Howard\u2019s books, but they\u2019re the only details we have for now.  Although the story of Conan was written by Howard back in 1932, and published as a series of stories in Weird Tales magazine, it\u2019s been adapted for the screen a few times. The most popular was Conan The Barbarian, which was released in 1982 with Arnold Schwarzenegger in the lead role.  The move to create an original show about the iconic Cimmerian, alongside the news of The Lord of the Rings prequel stories, points to a big fantasy world-building focus for Amazon. This is hardly surprising given the huge success of Game of Thrones, which many critics believe the streaming platforms will try and ride the wave of with their own fantasy genre offerings.  When? TBC  Good Omens will be available on Amazon Prime Video in 2019 (Image: \u00a9 Amazon Prime )  Good Omens  In 2017 Amazon lifted the lid on its plans for a TV series adaptation of Neil Gaiman and Terry Prachett\u2019s fantasy novel, Good Omens. Although the show isn\u2019t set to be released until 2019, leaked images of David Tennant, Michael Sheen and Jon Hamm in character have been already been causing a stir among fans.  Those who loved the novel will be happy to hear Neil Gaiman has also written the six-part series, which is being produced by BBC Studios with Doctor Who and Outlander director Douglas Mackinnon at the helm.  When? 2019  Sneaky Pete Season 2  Sneaky Pete is a crime drama created by writer and producer David Shore, of House and The Good Doctor fame, and superstar actor, director and screenwriter Bryan Cranston. It follows the story of Marius, played by Giovanni Ribisi, a released convict who assumes the life of his cell-mate in order to escape his past life.  Interestingly, the pilot for the show was originally developed for CBS, but the network dropped it before it aired. But this setback obviously didn\u2019t stop the show going ahead because it was quickly snapped up by Amazon. Judging from the great reviews the first season received, that was a very wise move on Amazon\u2019s part and the second season promises to be just as good.

The Echo range of smart speakers are now available for pre-order on Amazon Australia with the units going on sale early February. And with them comes our own true-blue Alexa, with what we can only assume is going to be a fair dinkum Aussie accent.  Getting smart  Alexa is Amazon\u2019s own digital assistant, the voice behind the Echo range of speakers and bitter rival of Google's own smart assistant ecosystem, currently comprised of the Google Home and Google Home Mini.  With these speakers you can play music, get weather updates, set alarms, keep tabs on your appointments, control your lights and do plenty more.  Amazon Echo was the first model to launch. With a 2.5-inch woofer, a dedicated tweeter, 360-degree audio and Dolby sound, it\u2019s a capable standalone smart speaker for any home.  The Echo Plus does everything the Echo can but comes packing a smart home hub that makes connecting to your smart home devices easy.  The Echo Dot is the baby of the bunch and is a great way to smarten up the home at an affordable cost.  Pricing and availability  The Echo, Echo Dot and Echo Plus are available to pre-order on Amazon for $149, $79 and $229 respectively. The smart speakers go on sale in early February, and will be up for purchase at JB Hi-FI, Officeworks, Telstra and Myer.  If you hurry, though, you could snag the speaker for less \u2013 Amazon is offering introductory prices for a limited time. The Echo Dot can be had for just $49, while the Echo and Echo Plus carry an introductory price tag of $119 and $199 respectively.  For anyone looking to set up multi-room smarts, getting a two-pack of Dots for just $79 means you save more, while the Echo Plus comes with a bonus Philips Hue smart bulb.  Amazon is also launching its music streaming service in Australia and New Zealand alongside the speakers.

Now, though, you could add whale sounds from Spotify to that Routine for those particularly stressful days.  Your Routines can include music from a specific artist, album, playlist or radio station and supported services currently include Amazon Music, Spotify, Deezer, TuneIn and Pandora. According to Amazon you can also create a volume action to control how quiet or loud the audio output will be.  Routine rhythms  These more well-rounded Routines appear to be part of a concentrated effort on Amazon\u2019s part to make Alexa a more personable assistant that\u2019s useful beyond single commands and actually helps you in your daily routine. Alongside these music controls you can also use Routines to get weather, news and traffic reports, control your smart home and have Alexa chime in with a phrase like \u201cwelcome home.\u201d  Conveniently, it\u2019s also possible to schedule these Routines so if you\u2019d like to wake up on a weekend morning with your favourite podcast playing while your smart coffee maker starts brewing you can.  Despite the fact that Alexa was able to use Routines before Google Assistant, it\u2019s worth noting that music integration is already available in Google Routines. Google Assistant Routines can also support audiobooks and while there\u2019s no Audible support for Alexa Routines just yet, we imagine that\u2019ll be in the works too if Amazon wants to be on even footing with its rival.

How it works  Thousands of brands large and small, selling through Amazon\u2019s Marketplace seller program, are now what drives Amazon\u2019s rapid growth in ad revenue. Jijamas, founded in 2013, wouldn\u2019t exist without Amazon, says Gustavo Sanchez, the brand\u2019s co-founder and chief executive. Jijamas sells one thing: Supersoft, high-end women\u2019s pajamas.  Starting at about $70 a set, they rarely turn up near the top of search results for \u201cpajamas\u201d on Amazon, says Mr. Sanchez, since the site\u2019s algorithm favors cheaper, higher-volume goods. Even its high customer ratings only help Jijamas get so far.  The company\u2019s revenue growth is dependent on Amazon advertising, Mr. Sanchez says.  Advertising on Amazon is much like advertising on Google\u2019s AdWords platform, says Daniel Knijnik, chief executive of Quartile, a small ad agency started last August that focuses solely on Amazon. Most ads appear atop search results for various keywords.  Jijamas, a specialty line of high-end pajamas, depends on Amazon for virtually all its revenue growth. Shown, Gustavo Sanchez, the brand\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, on January 26 in New York City. Photo: Kenneth Bachor/The Wall Street Journal  Advertising plays an important role in Amazon\u2019s lucrative direct-to-consumer marketplace, where Amazon, at added cost, provides warehousing and shipping to third-party sellers. Because advertising allows brands to connect better with Amazon\u2019s shoppers, Mr. Knijnik says, even manufacturers who previously sold wholesale to Amazon are now opening their own \u201cstores\u201d on the site.  For sellers like Mr. Sanchez, advertising on Amazon is a mixed bag. A \u201csponsored\u201d listing is essential for getting products to the top of search results, which is the only surefire way to sell anything on a site that offers millions of different products. But sponsored lists are also another way Amazon skims off his profits.  Amazon wants to deliver everything you want to your doorstep, anywhere in the world. But the e-commerce giant faces several challenges in its pursuit of a global empire. WSJ's Karan Deep Singh breaks down the basics with the help of an Amazon delivery box.  On top of the 15% of an item\u2019s selling price that Mr. Sanchez pays just to list Jijamas on Amazon\u2019s marketplace, and the 5% to 6% he pays to have Amazon warehouse and ship his products, there is now up to 12% going to advertising for every item sold through an ad. This April, Amazon will start charging an additional 2% to list apparel (it hasn\u2019t disclosed why). The net result is that Amazon will take about 35% of the price of each pair of Jijamas sold through its sponsored listings.  If Amazon decides to change its search result ranking algorithms or hike its ad fees, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing I can do about it,\u201d Mr. Sanchez says. Amazon represents 65% of his total sales, he adds; the remainder comes from his own website.  Where it can grow  Amazon is continually building and buying new sources of data on our tastes and consumer behavior, from its acquisition of Whole Foods and the build-out of its cashierless Amazon Go stores to the invasion of its low-cost, voice-powered speakers and the rapid increase in its library of streaming video.  Every time Amazon racks up another percentage point of the $5 trillion U.S. retail pie, another $50 billion in the kind of data that Google and Facebook relied on disappears from their systems. Plus, Amazon understands shoppers in a way Google and Facebook might not.  \u201cAmazon doesn\u2019t just know what you buy, they also know about how you shop,\u201d says Diana Gordon, director of Shop+, the ecommerce-focused arm of WPP-owned ad firm Mindshare. \u201cThey know your browsing behavior, the cadence with which you restock certain types of consumables,\u201d she adds.  Amazon is building out not only its self-service ad business but also the sales team devoted to getting brands on board.  All of this could give Amazon an edge over Google and Facebook, but for it to scale that business, it will have to look beyond ads targeted at consumers who are already shopping on its sites.  For that, Amazon has a web-spanning advertising network just like Google\u2019s and Facebook\u2019s\u2014which is the reason a vacuum cleaner you once almost bought can haunt you for weeks on random websites. The Amazon Advertising Platform lets advertisers manage ad buys across multiple advertising exchanges, and it has quietly become as familiar to marketers as its equivalent from Google-owned DoubleClick.  Amazon is building out not only its self-service ad business but also the sales team charged with getting more brands on board. Shown, Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos in May. Photo: April Greer/The Washington Post/Getty Images  Amazon also needs to expand the number of places it can sell advertisements, which is one reason the company bought videogame-streaming behemoth Twitch and is investing so heavily in its own streaming-video offerings.  The company has been creative about where it places ads\u2014ever notice a movie ad on the side of an Amazon box shipped to your house?

AMZN -1.22% has tapped NBC Entertainment President Jennifer Salke to head Amazon Studios, its movie and television unit, succeeding Roy Price, who resigned amid allegations that he engaged in sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior toward a producer.  At Amazon, Ms. Salke, 53 years old, will oversee a deep-pocketed and ambitious online video service with an annual budget of more than $4.5 billion, according to people at the company.  Its best-known television series include \u201cTransparent,\u201d \u201cThe Tick\u201d and \u201cBosch.\u201d Its most successful films have been \u201cThe Big Sick\u201d and Oscar winner \u201cManchester by the Sea.\u201d However Amazon has struggled to find broadly popular hits like HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and Netflix Inc.\u2019s \u201cStranger Things.\u201d  Among the challenges facing Ms. Salke will be improving relations with the creative community, some of whom criticized the way Amazon operated during Mr. Price\u2019s seven-year tenure. Several producers expressed frustration at what they called creative interference by Amazon executives, often leading to production delays and greater expenses. David E. Kelley, who created the legal drama \u201cGoliath\u201d for Amazon, told The Wall Street Journal last fall that the company is \u201cin way over their heads.\u201d  \u201cWhat stood out about Jen was the deep relationships she has nurtured with creators and talent over her career,\u201d Jeffrey Blackburn, the Seattle-based Amazon executive to whom Ms. Salke will report, said in a statement. \u201cShe\u2019s built an impeccable reputation as a big leader who emphasizes creativity, collaboration, and teamwork.\u201d  Since Mr. Price left in October, Amazon Studios has been overseen by Chief Operating Officer Albert Cheng, whose background is primarily in technology and digital media.  Related Video Amazon wants to deliver everything you want to your doorstep, anywhere in the world. But the e-commerce giant faces several challenges in its pursuit of a global empire. WSJ's Karan Deep Singh breaks down the basics with the help of an Amazon delivery box.  Shortly after Mr. Price stepped down, his lawyer, Eric George, said the executive had never been accused of sexual harassment \u201cwith the sole exception of the incident alleged by [the producer], the portrayal of which he vigorously contests.\u201d  The hiring of Ms. Salke, who has run NBC\u2019s prime-time entertainment since 2011, comes after a very public and drawn-out search for Mr. Price\u2019s successor. A leading candidate, Fox Television Group Chairman and Chief Executive Dana Walden, took herself out of consideration early on; another candidate\u2014A&E Networks Group Chief Executive Nancy Dubuc\u2014was also in the running. Fox\u2019s parent, 21st Century Fox Inc., shares common ownership with News Corp., which owns The Wall Street Journal.  In a statement, Ms. Salke said Amazon has \u201cinnovated, disrupted, and created characters that are already an indelible part of pop-culture.\u201d  One of Ms. Salke\u2019s biggest tasks will be overseeing Amazon\u2019s production of \u201cLord of the Rings,\u201d an ambitious and expensive series based on J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s popular fantasy novels. Amazon won a bidding war for the rights to the series, which was given a multi-season commitment.  Ms. Salke has a solid track record as a television development executive. Shows developed on her watch at NBC include the drama \u201cThis Is Us\u201d and the comedy \u201cThe Good Place.\u201d She also oversees Universal Television, the production studio at NBCUniversal which produces shows for NBC and other networks and services. NBCUniversal is a unit of Comcast Corp.  However, Ms. Salke has no experience running a world-wide digital business or in movies, both of which she will oversee in her new post. Amazon is taking a bet that she can successfully handle those new responsibilities.  Prior to joining NBC, Ms. Salke was a television-studio executive at 21st Century Fox. She started her career at Aaron Spelling Productions.  No successor for Ms. Salke was named by NBC Entertainment Chairman Robert Greenblatt. Other senior entertainment executives who will likely be under consideration include Pearlena Igbokwe, who is president of Universal Television, and NBC programming executives Bruce Evans and Lisa Katz.

With a foray into financial services, Amazon would have a chance to become an even bigger part of Americans\u2019 lives. Photo: lindsey wasson/Reuters  Amazon.com Inc. AMZN -1.22% is in talks with big banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. about building a checking-account-like product the online retailer could offer its customers, according to people familiar with the matter.  The effort is still in its early stages and may not come to fruition, the people said. The talks with financial firms are focused on creating a product that would appeal to younger customers and those without bank accounts. Whatever its final form, the initiative wouldn\u2019t involve Amazon becoming a bank, the people said.  If the product emerges, it would further inject Amazon into the lives of those who shop on its website and at its Whole Foods grocery stores, read on its Kindles, watch its streaming video and chat with Alexa, its digital assistant. Offering a product that is similar to an own-branded bank account could help reduce fees Amazon pays to financial firms and provide it with valuable data on customers\u2019 income and spending habits.  The company\u2019s latest push also answers a question that bank executives have been asking with increasing worry: When will Amazon show up on their turf?  With millions of customers, troves of data, access to cheap capital and seemingly unlimited leeway from its investors to enter new businesses, Amazon is a fearsome competitor. Its more-than $700 billion market value eclipses the combined value of JPMorgan and Bank of America Corp , the two biggest U.S. banks.  Already, Amazon is building a delivery service that one day could compete with United Parcel Service Inc. and FedEx Corp. , targeting the hospital-supplies market and considering a push into prescription drugs. Shares of companies in those industries have fallen sharply on news of Amazon\u2019s entry.  In banking, however, Amazon appears to be arriving more as a partner than a disrupter.  Last fall, it put out a request for proposals from several banks for a hybrid-type checking account and is weighing pitches from firms including JPMorgan and Capital One Financial Corp. , some of the people said. It is too early to say exactly what the product will look like, including whether it would give customers the ability to write checks, directly pay bills, or access to a nationwide ATM network.  Amazon\u2019s collaborative approach supports what bank executives have long said: that new regulations put in place after the financial crisis, while bad for profitability, are a protective moat against challengers.  Related Video Amazon wants to deliver everything you want to your doorstep, anywhere in the world. But the e-commerce giant faces several challenges in its pursuit of a global empire. WSJ's Karan Deep Singh breaks down the basics with the help of an Amazon delivery box.  Any move by Amazon to start its own banking arm would subject it to capital rules and other regulations that likely would limit its aggressive expansion. And there would likely be stiff opposition. An effort by Walmart Inc. more than a decade ago to obtain a type of banking license withered after intense criticism from a range of companies and lawmakers.  For JPMorgan or Capital One, winning the assignment would be a chance to keep a potential competitor close and strengthen ties to a company that is popular among millennials, whose financial habits are changing quickly. In a recent poll of 1,000 Amazon customers conducted by LendEDU, an online student-loan marketplace, 38% said they would trust Amazon to handle their finances equally as they would a traditional bank.  JPMorgan is already close to Amazon. It has issued Amazon-branded credit cards since 2002, and the two companies are teaming up along with Berkshire Hathaway Inc. on an initiative to tackle rising health-care costs for their employees.  Amazon, led by CEO Jeff Bezos, last fall put out a request for proposals from several banks for a hybrid-type checking account. Photo: Mike Kane/Bloomberg News  JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer James Dimon has said he nearly joined Amazon as an executive in the 1990s. He remains an admirer of the company\u2019s CEO, Jeff Bezos, whom he called a \u201cfriend of the family\u201d at an investor presentation last week.  Capital One, meanwhile, is one of the largest bank users of Amazon\u2019s cloud-computing business.  Amazon has been considering a bigger push into finance for years, looking to reduce the fees it pays banks and payments processors, people familiar with the matter said. Providing Amazon customers with a checking account from which they could directly withdraw cash for purchases could help to reduce some of those fees. But there isn\u2019t much precedent for this type of arrangement. It is much more complicated than, say, a co-branded credit card.  Converting its shoppers into financial account holders could also aid Amazon as it ramps up its efforts in payments, a fragmented segment with no clear winner yet. The company has had limited success in getting its own system, Amazon Pay, accepted at other online merchants.  The company is now trying to bring Amazon Pay to brick-and-mortar stores, according to people familiar with those plans. It is likely to begin with Whole Foods, which Amazon bought last year for roughly $13.5 billion, the people said.  Not yet clear: what Amazon can offer merchants, which already face a number of payment providers jockeying for space at the checkout counter. But shoppers who have an everyday banking relationship with Amazon might be more likely to use Amazon Pay.  Amazon isn\u2019t the first retailer to make a play in financial services. In the early 1980s, Sears Holding Corp. bought brokerage Dean Witter. Critics dubbed the offering \u201csocks and stocks.\u201d Sears divested Dean Witter in the early 1990s.  \u2014AnnaMaria Andriotis  contributed to this article.

Airbnb said in a statement that it selected Mr. Greeley, who will start March 18, due to his operational experience and customer focus. Donna Boyer, director of product for the Homes unit, left the company in January and Airbnb has seen other high profile departures, including its CFO Laurence Tosi, who stepped down last month.  The Homes unit\u2014which includes the apartment and whole-home rentals for which Airbnb is known\u2014represents nearly all of the San Francisco startup\u2019s $2.57 billion in 2017 revenue.  Last month Airbnb announced a series of sweeping changes to Homes, adding options like hotels, a higher-end tier of homes called Plus, and a loyalty program.  The company is grappling with limited inventory in some of its most popular destinations as well as customer complaints of inconsistent home quality. It also has addressed renters\u2019 claims that hosts had discriminated against them. The company implemented changes in late 2016 to ensure hosts couldn\u2019t discriminate.

Officials from the Fair Trade Commission, Japan\u2019s antitrust watchdog, have visited the headquarters of Amazon Japan to see if any violations of the Antimonopoly Act have taken place, a government official said Thursday.  Amazon is fully cooperating with the commission, an Amazon Japan spokeswoman said, without elaborating.  The official declined to specify why the government was investigating Amazon. But he said that in general, the commission was concerned about cases in which sellers of goods may face harm from spurning the demands of powerful retailers.  The commission was interested in ways powerful online retailers can distort competition, reduce incentives to cut prices elsewhere and gain an advantage over other online shopping mall operators, he added.  Japan accounted for $11.9 billion, or nearly 7%, of Amazon\u2019s $178 billion in global sales in 2017. That made it the third-biggest market for the company after the U.S. and Germany.

WSJ's Karan Deep Singh breaks down the basics with the help of an Amazon delivery box.  As in the U.S., the company\u2019s rapid growth and aggressive pricing has generated wide ripple effects across the Japanese retail industry\u2014to the extent that the Bank of Japan has cited low e-commerce prices as one reason for the nation\u2019s sluggish inflation.  Amazon commanded the biggest portion of Japan\u2019s e-commerce market in 2016, at more than 20%, according to a survey by the Japan External Trade Organization. That scale makes it hard for sellers\u2014already fighting for customers as the population shrinks\u2014to refuse requests from Amazon, government officials have said.  The Japan Fair Trade Commission closed a previous probe of Amazon Japan just nine months ago. The commission said it found Amazon Japan had demanded that suppliers offer Amazon customers prices equal to or less than their prices on other online shopping sites such as those run by Rakuten Inc. or Yahoo Japan Corp.  The commission said the practice could give Amazon Japan the broadest lineup of goods at the lowest prices and hinder competition.  Amazon Japan said at the time that it promised Japanese regulators to stop requiring sellers to match the price offered on other sites. The commission closed its probe in exchange.

AMZN -1.22% said it would start delivering Whole Foods groceries via its fastest delivery option in four markets, marking the first major integration between its e-commerce operations and its new brick-and-mortar grocery chain.  The online retail giant will add Whole Foods to its one- and two-hour delivery option, Prime Now, in the grocer\u2019s hometown of Austin, Texas, as well as Dallas, Virginia Beach, Va. and Cincinnati, Ohio.  Stephenie Landry, the Amazon vice president who oversees Prime Now, said it plans to expand the effort, but declined to say how quickly. She noted that Prime Now grew to more than 50 global markets in less than three years following its creation.  Amazon\u2019s latest move is one of the first to potentially take aim at major grocers racing to offer deliveries and pickups to better compete with Amazon, along with rival online delivery services like Instacart Inc., which currently delivers from Whole Foods. Grocer stocks were hit hard by the news of Amazon\u2019s decision to purchase Whole Foods last summer, with six major food retailers losing roughly $12 billion in value after the deal\u2019s announcement.  Still, Amazon has struggled in recent years to make its grocery delivery business work. Its grocery delivery arm AmazonFresh was scaled back late last year, ending service in some ZIP Codes. The company\u2019s acquisition of Whole Foods was viewed by some analysts as a way to help address some of those challenges.  Analysts have largely expected Amazon to start offering Whole Foods deliveries since the roughly $13.5 billion deal was announced. Already Amazon pairs with grocer Sprouts Farmers Market Inc. and other outside retailers and restaurants in some markets to offer speedy deliveries.

For the new Prime Now deliveries, employees will pick the orders in store from the shelves as they come in. Customers will be able to select from a variety of fresh produce and proteins, and some in-store items won\u2019t be available. Prices may also differ.  Prime Now is available only to the company\u2019s Prime members, who typically pay $99 annually. Two-hour deliveries are free on orders over $35, but tips are suggested for drivers. One-hour delivery costs $7.99.  Amazon has previously lowered prices at Whole Foods and started offering some of the grocer\u2019s private label brands on its website and via Prime Now. It also plans to introduce benefits for members of its Prime program.  Ms. Landry said that Whole Foods and Amazon have been partnering on the Prime Now initiative, allowing Amazon to take advantage of the grocers\u2019 marketing expertise and in-store operations.  \u201cYou\u2019re going to continue to see us doing lots of things together,\u201d she added.  \u2014Heather Haddon contributed to this article  Write to Laura Stevens at laura.stevens@wsj.com", "stock": "AMZN", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-08", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-to-deliver-whole-foods-groceries-1518066000"}, {"article": "Amazon.com Inc. AMZN -1.22% is scheduled to announce its fourth-quarter earnings after the market closes Thursday. Here\u2019s what you need to know:  EARNINGS FORECAST: Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Amazon to earn $1.85 a share, compared with $1.54 a year ago. The company has forecast an operating income range between $300 million and $1.65 billion, compared with income of $1.26 billion a year ago.  REVENUE FORECAST: Quarterly revenue of $59.83 billion is forecast by the analysts, compared with $43.74 billion a year ago. Amazon said it expected sales of between $56 billion and $60.5 billion for the quarter, which includes growth from its acquisition of Whole Foods.  WHAT TO WATCH:  \u2014HOLIDAYS: Amazon lately has been demonstrating a little more fiscal discipline, something that may pay off with record profitability in its all-important fourth quarter. Already, industry numbers are indicating a positive holiday season for retailers as consumers spent more, something that should benefit Amazon, which has a 40%-plus share of online shopping.  \u2014WHOLE FOODS: Amazon acquired Whole Foods in August, and the fourth quarter is the first full quarter of reporting. Amazon has so far added lockers for package pickups and lowered prices. Analysts will expect some evidence of whether it is paying off. For roughly one month in the third quarter, the grocery chain contributed about $1.28 billion in sales and $21 million in operating income.  \u2014HQ2: Executives may provide an update on its search for a second headquarters. The company earlier this month narrowed its list to 20 from 238. The stakes are high: Amazon has said it plans to create about 50,000 jobs and invest $5 billion over nearly 20 years.  \u2014HEALTH CARE: Amazon on Tuesday said it was joining JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. to form a new company focusing on lowering U.S. health-care costs. The companies hope the entire health-care project could at a minimum save them hundreds of millions of dollars, according to a person familiar with the matter.

More investors are pushing companies to change food-waste and packaging practices that they see as a potential drag on profits in a low-margin business. Many companies are responding. Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc., Walmart Inc. and other food retailers are working with shareholders who have raised such concerns. Costco Wholesale Corp. , Target Corp. and Chipotle Mexican Grill , Inc. have acknowledged similar investor requests.  Related Tech Startups Take a Bite Out of Food Waste  \u201cFood retailers are struggling with top-line sales growth, and they are looking for other areas to cut,\u201d said Chris Cochran, ReFED\u2019s executive director and a former Walmart senior manager.  Dunkin\u2019 Brands Group Inc. received a shareholder request earlier this year to assess the environmental impacts of its coffee-container pods. The company\u2019s supplier agreed to make them recyclable by 2020. Walmart responded to concerned shareholders last year with a 160-page strategy for reducing food waste.  And in 2016, Starboard Value LP faulted Darden Restaurants Inc. for the ample servings of free breadsticks at its Olive Garden restaurants during a larger proxy battle. \u201cMost customers will not eat all of the breadsticks, creating an enormous amount of waste,\u201d Starboard wrote to investors.

The indefatigable CEO stopped appearing personally on Amazon\u2019s quarterly earnings calls years ago, but he had a clear message for investors Thursday when the online retail giant posted record earnings along with a 38% jump in sales for the fourth quarter. Writing of the strong success of his company\u2019s voice-activated digital assistant technology called Alexa, Mr. Bezos noted in the company\u2019s release: \u201cWe don\u2019t see positive surprises of this magnitude very often\u2014expect us to double down.\u201d  It is unlikely that he means just more speakers. Amazon has long been sharply focused on driving growth with little urgency to boost profits. It has been richly rewarded by investors for doing so. Amazon\u2019s market value soared 56% last year, beating all of its Big Tech peers despite their much fatter bottom lines. For example, Facebook generated about 50 cents in operating earnings for every dollar of revenue in 2017; Amazon generated 2.3 cents by the same measure.  It is worth noting that Mr. Bezos\u2019s biggest gambles actually take a while to pay off. It was 13 years ago today that he first announced Amazon Prime, a membership-based shipping service. At the time, it seemed improbable that many people would pay $79 a year to get \u201cHarry Potter\u201d books rushed to their doorstep. But Prime has since become a must-have for more than 90 million members in the U.S. alone, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. It now generates more than $9 billion in subscription fee revenue per year for Amazon and effectively locks in Amazon as the first choice in shopping destinations for its paying members.  It isn\u2019t cheap to maintain, though. Amazon has since sweetened Prime with services like video and music on demand, putting the company into the business of creating new content to keep attracting users.  There seems to be no limit to where Amazon will eventually spread. The company became a major grocer last year with its acquisition of Whole Foods Market and even has been making rumblings about getting into health care of late. The company even noted the contribution of revenue from its budding advertising business on Thursday.  Mr. Bezos\u2019s ambitions have helped make Amazon the world\u2019s fourth most valuable company and himself the world\u2019s wealthiest person. His third decade at the helm has brought no signs of slowing down. Once-skeptical investors may dread the day he does.

AMZN -1.22% integrates the pioneering natural grocer into its retail empire.  More than a dozen executives and senior managers have left since Amazon acquired Whole Foods last year, according to former employees and recruiters steering them to new jobs. People who have left include leaders of the bakery, produce, sustainability and local-foods divisions.  Some veterans have left even though higher-ups asked them to stay. Others say they were pushed out after the deal was announced but before it closed, as Whole Foods sought to tighten command.  Executives from Amazon and Whole Foods said that the two companies share a customer focus, are fitting together well and have made great strides in the merger in a short time. But the exodus has raised concerns among employees and suppliers that the distinctive approach that made Whole Foods a natural and organic powerhouse won\u2019t endure under Amazon\u2019s ownership.  \u201cCulturally it\u2019s been a rough start,\u201d said a procurement veteran who left Whole Foods earlier this year after nearly a decade.  Some of the grocer\u2019s top managers have bristled at reporting to younger Amazon executives, people who work with them say. Other employees say Amazon hasn\u2019t explained the specifics of its plans to integrate the grocer into its business.  Amazon wants to deliver everything you want to your doorstep, anywhere in the world. But the e-commerce giant faces several challenges in its pursuit of a global empire. WSJ's Karan Deep Singh breaks down the basics with the help of an Amazon delivery box.  Whole Foods chief executive and co-founder John Mackey and Steve Kessel, an Amazon senior vice president who oversees the grocer, said in separate statements that Whole Foods has thrived in the seven months since the e-commerce giant bought it for roughly $13.5 billion.  \u201cWe...have maintained our distinctive culture while embracing many of Amazon\u2019s leadership principles,\u201d Mr. Mackey said.  \u201cWe are off to a great start, and look forward to many years of future success together,\u201d Mr. Kessel said.  Executive departures are common after mergers. Amazon and Whole Foods have held town halls for store employees to discuss their concerns.  This week, executives invited top suppliers to Whole Foods\u2019 Austin headquarters to discuss their frustration with operational changes, including fee increases that predate the merger. Some suppliers said the additional cost could force them to raise prices or defect to other retailers.  The fee increases are overdue and the changes are providing more consistency for suppliers, a spokeswoman said. Whole Foods leaders at the meeting discussed new merchandising opportunities and growth plans with roughly 200 suppliers, she said.  Some Whole Foods executives are urging their colleagues to be patient. They say Amazon can help the grocer make technology improvements, and new ownership has relieved the company of shareholder pressure to reverse falling sales. Some Whole Foods department managers described Amazon executives as respectful and eager to learn from the grocer\u2019s decades of experience sourcing food and handling produce.  Some Whole Foods employees want Amazon executives to tackle the grocer\u2019s problems more aggressively. Already, Amazon executives have questioned an inventory-management system that has left many Whole Foods stores short of some products, according to a person familiar with the discussions.  But other Whole Foods veterans have been frustrated by what they see as Amazon\u2019s insular culture and penchant for secrecy, according to current and former employees. \u201cThere really hasn\u2019t been very much communication,\u201d one former executive said.  Some cited the two organizations\u2019 fundamental differences on issues such as promoting and grooming talent, and whether to focus more on needs of customers or employees. They have noted pressure to put on a good face for Amazon executives, including among the rank and file during town hall meetings.  Some suppliers said new hires at Whole Foods have been slow to master the chain\u2019s techniques for sourcing and marketing healthful foods. Many executives who have left, meanwhile, are consulting for other natural-food companies and interviewing with other retailers, taking that knowledge to competitors.  \u201cIt makes it really difficult when you lose the institutional knowledge,\u201d said Bill Caskey, co-founder of the food consultancy Pentallect Inc.  John Mackey, the founder and CEO of Whole Foods, in a Chicago store in 2017. \u2018We...have maintained our distinctive culture while embracing many of Amazon\u2019s leadership principles,\u2019 Mr. Mackey says.

Pedestrians walked past an Amazon Go store in Seattle in April 2017. The cashierless convenience store, which had been open only to employees for testing purposes, is scheduled to open to the public on Monday after a yearlong delay. Photo: Elaine Thompson/Associated Press  Nearly a year after it was promised, Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s AMZN -1.22% cashierless convenience store is slated to open to the public on Monday.  The new Amazon Go store, located in the base of Amazon\u2019s main headquarters in Seattle, uses computer vision and machine-learning algorithms to track shoppers and charge them for what they select, thereby eliminating checkout counters.  In an interview last week, Dilip Kumar, vice president of technology for Amazon Go and Amazon Books, said testing with employees has trained the technology to work in the store, an experiment that is part of the company\u2019s broader effort to reinvent how consumers shop.  Mr. Kumar declined to say whether Amazon will expand the Go concept, although he said the company has developed the technology to scale.  From the Archives Amazon unveiled its first small-format grocery store, Amazon Go, on Monday. It\u2019s one of at least three formats of brick-and-mortar food stores the online retail giant is exploring. Photo: Amazon.com Inc. (Originally published Dec. 5, 2016)  Amazon announced the new Go store with fanfare in December 2016, and said it would open to the public in early 2017. The opening was delayed, however, as the technology proved more difficult to master than expected, with glitches occurring when too many people were in the store or were moving too quickly, The Wall Street Journal reported in March 2017.  Amazon didn\u2019t explain the delay at the time. According to Mr. Kumar, while the store was originally expected to quickly open to the public to gain extra traffic needed for testing, the company decided it had enough employees to teach the system instead.  That training helped Amazon Go\u2019s technology better identify objects and follow the different speeds and patterns of shoppers, tasks Mr. Kumar described as particularly challenging in a crowd.  Some people \u201cmove in very unpredictable ways,\u201d Mr. Kumar said. \u201cYou\u2019re always bending down, you\u2019re examining items, you\u2019re picking things up.\u201d  The Go experiment shows how Amazon is trying to transform shopping in physical stores after decades of pioneering retail online. Since 2015, the company also has added more than a dozen Amazon Books stores, which encourage customers to pull out their phones to scan covers for prices.  In August, Amazon completed a $13.5 billion deal to buy grocery chain Whole Foods, adding 470 brick-and-mortar stores to its portfolio overnight.  Amazon Go\u2019s technology uses cameras throughout the store to track shoppers once they are inside, though it doesn\u2019t use facial recognition, Mr. Kumar said. A customer entering the store scans his or her phone and then becomes represented internally as a 3-D object to the system. Cameras also are pointed at the shelves to determine interactions with goods.  Shoppers browse the items at the Amazon Go store in Seattle during its employee-only testing phase. The store uses computer vision and machine-learning algorithms to track shoppers. Photo: Elaine Thompson/Associated Press  Among the challenges for the technology was telling the difference between similar looking products\u2014say containers of vanilla and regular yogurt. Adding to the complexity, when customers pick up products, they usually cover the distinguishing aspects of the label with their hands.  Some store associates are still needed. For example, customers purchasing alcohol must show identification.  Former Amazon executives say it likely would be difficult to scale the system to track people in a bigger store, and that it could take years to make it work in a larger store footprint. Still, they say it may make sense one day for Amazon to try to implement the technology more widely\u2014either via additional Go stores or even in Whole Foods.  Mr. Kumar said there are currently no plans to introduce the technology in Whole Foods. He added, however, that every project should be expandable.  \u201cWe have this unwritten rule that whatever it is you\u2019re building, you have to be able to scale it so that it covers significantly amount of more load than what you would normally ever expect,\u201d Mr. Kumar said.

The partnership will include opening a combined e-commerce fulfillment center in the Tokyo area to deliver groceries to a wider area.  The partnership could boost Wal-Mart \u2019s position in a promising business where Amazon isn\u2019t yet strong. Japanese spent about $19 billion on food deliveries in the year ended March 2017, including orders made in person, over the phone or online, according to Yano Research Institute. That number is growing as more women work and the elderly population rises. Rakuten shares jumped during Tokyo trading Friday when the deal was announced and closed 4.5% higher.  But Wal-Mart faces plenty of other competitors in food delivery, such as stores owned by Seven & I Holdings Co. , the Tokyo-based parent of the 7-Eleven convenience-store chain. Food cooperatives and smaller ventures that target niche markets, such as organic vegetables, are also vying for customers. Wal-Mart and Rakuten said they would offer meal kits, a product already sold by many of their rivals.  In the U.S., Wal-Mart will work with Rakuten\u2019s Canadian unit, Rakuten Kobo, to offer for the first time e-books and audiobooks in the U.S., as the company tries to make walmart.com, a destination for a wider variety of purchases and activities.  The deal \u201cenables us to quickly and efficiently launch a full eBook and audiobook catalog on Walmart.com,\u201d Scott Hilton, chief revenue officer for Wal-Mart \u2019s U.S. e-commerce unit, wrote in a blog post Thursday. The digital books could also be offered in stores.  Amazon, which started as an online bookseller and has grown rapidly into other categories, dominates the U.S. market for e-books and has sold millions of its Kindle e-readers. Kobo sells its own e-reader device, which Wal-Mart will now carry.  Wal-Mart has expanded its U.S. e-commerce sales in recent quarters after rolling out online grocery services and buying a string of online startups, including Jet.com Inc. in 2016, placing the site\u2019s founder Marc Lore at the head of U.S. e-commerce operations.  In Japan, both Rakuten and Wal-Mart are struggling to keep Amazon at bay. In 2016, Japan was the second-largest market outside the U.S. for Amazon, following Germany, with sales of $10.8 billion.  Wal-Mart has moved away from building its own stand-alone e-commerce sites and infrastructure internationally. Two years ago, Wal-Mart sold its Chinese e-commerce business Yihaodian to JD.com Inc. and holds a roughly 10% stake in China\u2019s second-largest e-commerce company after Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.  Wal-Mart and Rakuten declined to disclose the financial terms of the deal. Under pressure from Amazon, Rakuten\u2019s e-commerce profits are stalling despite growing revenue, prompting it to search for new businesses.  Last month, Rakuten said it was applying for spectrum to become Japan\u2019s fourth major cellphone carrier.

AMZN -1.22% is best known for transforming the U.S. retail industry, a feat that President Donald Trump has recently attacked.  But the company has quietly been cultivating a major customer in his own backyard: the federal government.  In the past several years, the Seattle-based company has won much of the business to help the government shift computing services from legacy mainframes onto the cloud, a business where Amazon is the world leader.  This extraordinary transformation has included the provision of cloud services across Washington\u2019s bureaucracy, from the Department of Homeland Security to the Smithsonian Institution. It also has made the U.S. government a top Amazon customer.  The company doesn\u2019t release specifics, but GBH Insights, a research firm, predicts that Amazon\u2019s government business will grow to $2.8 billion in 2018 and $4.6 billion in 2019, up from less than $300 million in 2015. Other company analysts say those projections are optimistic, but not implausible.  An even bigger prize looms: Amazon is seeking a 10-year contract with the Department of Defense that could be worth $10 billion.  In Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on Amazon, suggesting the company doesn\u2019t pay its fair share of taxes and has damaged the Post Office, he hasn\u2019t mentioned Amazon\u2019s federal government business.  \u201cAmazon is just not on an even playing field,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Thursday. \u201cThey have a tremendous lobbying effort, in addition to having the Washington Post... What they have is a very uneven playing field. Look at the sales tax situation.\u201d He added, \u201cwe\u2019re going to take a pretty serious look.\u201d  Analysts say they don\u2019t see a reason to doubt Amazon will continue to rise as a major Washington contractor, though the president\u2019s criticisms have whipsawed its stock price and injected uncertainty into the equation.  \u201cThe overriding question is whether there is risk to Amazon because Trump seems to have it in for the company,\u201d said Tom Forte, an analyst at D.A. Davidson & Co.  Mr. Forte added that it would be hard for the administration to shift the government\u2019s business elsewhere because of the small number of competitors and the scale of Amazon\u2019s cloud network\u2014data-storage centers arrayed around the country and the globe that provide greater computing power and redundancy in case of emergency.  White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Wednesday that Mr. Trump is \u201cnot involved in the process\u201d of awarding the Defense Department contract.  Amazon\u2019s competitors have seized the moment to seek to slow the company\u2019s march into government business. Over dinner with Mr. Trump on Tuesday at the White House, Oracle Corp.\u2019s co-CEO, Safra Catz, complained that the Pentagon\u2019s process gives Amazon an advantage.  Amazon\u2019s growing government business coincides with a rapid rise of its presence in Washington. In 2010, the company employed eight lobbyists and spent $2.1 million lobbying federal officials, according to data compiled by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. Last year, Amazon spent $13 million and employed 95 lobbyists. Only six other companies spent more on lobbying in 2017.  Amazon has also mounted an aggressive effort to hire former government officials and executives from the company\u2019s competitors to help it navigate government procurement rules. In 2010, the company hired Teresa Carlson, who led federal sales at Microsoft Corp. Scott Renda joined the company in 2014 from the Obama administration, where he oversaw efforts to develop cloud computing.  Newsletter Sign-up  Amazon\u2019s most important early win was in 2013 with a contract to house data for intelligence agencies, including the Central Intelligence Agency. Amazon fought off a challenge from International Business Machines Corp. to retain the contract.  The intelligence community\u2019s willingness to entrust its closely held data to Amazon was a vital signal to other government agencies. Amid a general enthusiasm for using cloud computing to improve effectiveness, the CIA imprimatur suggested that Amazon Web Services, the cloud-computing division known as AWS, was a safe choice, these observers said.  Later that year, the Interior Department awarded a $10 billion contract to 10 vendors, half of whom partnered with Amazon.  In 2014, Amazon benefited from another Obama-era computing initiative: 18F, a consultancy made up of former Silicon Valley developers, which guides government agencies on software and computing procurement.  One of 18F\u2019s first projects was cloud.gov, which helps government agencies such as the Federal Election Commission move some data into the cloud. The government chose to run Cloud.gov on AWS\u2019 GovCloud service, making it easier for government agencies to purchase other Amazon services.  Related Video Amazon wants to deliver everything you want to your doorstep, anywhere in the world. WSJ's Karan Deep Singh breaks down the basics with the help of an Amazon delivery box.  Over time, Amazon has built up other security approvals from the government that allow it to store increasingly sensitive categories of data. Amazon is the only cloud company that has received approval for the government\u2019s most sensitive information.  Those security approvals have enabled Amazon to lock in an advantage over the competition, analysts say. In January, for instance, the U.S. Transportation Command, which manages transportation for the Pentagon, said it was prepared to award AWS a contract without a competitive bid. The company was the only \u201cresponsible source\u201d for the business, because it had been approved to handle government classifications up to \u201cSecret,\u201d the command said.  Amazon worked with 2,300 government entities in the U.S. and overseas in 2017, up from roughly 100 in 2011, according to data the company provided at a conference for Wall Street analysts.  Government sales have helped propel AWS to become Amazon\u2019s biggest profit source. Last year, the company\u2019s cloud computing business had $4.3 billion in operating income on $17 billion in sales, compared with operating income of $2.8 billion on sales of $106 billion at its North American retail business. Analysts estimate 10% of that comes from government contracts.  GBH Insights says Amazon is likely to win the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of $20 billion in federal cloud computing projects in the next five years. The Washington area is one of the finalists for Amazon\u2019s new \u201csecond headquarters.\u201d  The next big break could come with the Pentagon\u2019s planned $10 billion, 10-year move to the cloud. The proposed contract, called JEDI, would require a cloud infrastructure that could handle unclassified material as well as data classified as secret or top secret, defense department documents said.  Amazon\u2019s competitors worry that the Pentagon will award the contract to a single vendor, rather than multiple providers, which they say is preferable because it would provide needed redundancy in case of outages.  Competitors such as Oracle and Microsoft question the security of Amazon\u2019s cloud architecture. They also argue that Amazon could use its dominance to block other tech companies from winning government business.  A Pentagon spokesman said the department is \u201cconducting a full and open competition\u201d with \u201cno favorites.\u201d  \u2014Peter Nicholas, Gordon Lubold and Rebecca Ballhaus contributed to this article.

The outlook came on the back of the computing services and hardware firm\u2019s first quarterly revenue growth in six years.  \u201cWhile slight growth is a modest positive, we were largely underwhelmed by IBM\u2019s results, and felt the numbers showed IBM has much more work to do to turn the ship around,\u201d Deutsche Bank analyst Sherri Scribner wrote in a client note.  IBM\u2019s 3.6 percent revenue growth came mostly from a 71 percent jump in sales of its new Z14 mainframe, which was launched in September, and a 27 percent growth in its cloud business.  Several analysts pointed to the traditionally cyclical nature of mainframe revenues, which tend to surge for 2-4 quarters after the launch of a new launch before falling off.  But some said the growth since IBM launched its Z14 in September hinted at a different outcome.  Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty said the new mainframe\u2019s heightened focus on security was attracting more new customers and workloads rather than just upgrades at a time when cyberattacks and chip vulnerability are at the top of buyer\u2019s list of concerns.  A growth in the mainframe business might also improve IBM\u2019s margins. The company\u2019s fourth-quarter adjusted gross margins of 49.5 percent fell short of market expectations of 50.8 percent.  IBM has been moving away from its shrinking hardware and software businesses to what it calls \u201cstrategic imperatives,\u201d which includes the contribution of cloud computing \u2013 where companies use a remote network of data centers instead of their own hardware to cut costs.  Strategic Imperatives grew 14 percent in the quarter.  \u201cLooking under the surface, however, it appears that strategic imperatives excluding Systems only grew 6 percent, largely driven by the lack of Cognitive Solutions growth,\u201d Berenberg analyst Josep Bori said.  \u201cThis is clearly not enough to offset the declining core business,\u201d he said.  IBM said it would continue to \u201cmaintain a high level of investment\u201d in 2018 as it boosts its capabilities on cloud, mobile, cybersecurity and data analytics.  \u201cThis quarter was another important step in the right direction with 2018 a major prove me year for IBM to show the turnaround story is viable, which we believe it is, albeit at a snail-like pace,\u201d GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives said.", "stock": "IBM", "label": -1, "date": "2018-01-19", "source": "reuters", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ibm-results-research/ibm-shares-fall-on-soft-profit-outlook-idUSKBN1F81QV"}, {"article": "(Reuters) - Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) on Wednesday disclosed a new stake in generic drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (TEVA.TA) and said it bought more shares of Apple Inc (AAPL.O), which surpassed Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) as its largest common stock investment.

REUTERS/Brian Snyder  Armonk, New York-based IBM on Monday sued its former chief diversity officer, Lindsay-Rae McIntyre, who left for a similar job at Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O). The lawsuit alleges McIntyre violated a one-year non-competition agreement and could disclose IBM\u2019s diversity data and hiring plans.  IBM\u2019s stance puts it at odds with trends in the tech industry and broader corporate world towards sharing diversity success stories and best practices, instead seeming to view diversity as a zero-sum game.  The lawsuit is unusual because IBM is arguing its diversity data and strategy are economically valuable \u201ctrade secrets,\u201d a legal term typically associated with closely guarded formulas like that for Coca-Cola. It appears to be the first company to bring such a lawsuit against a rival over diversity efforts, legal experts said.  IBM cited in its complaint McIntyre\u2019s knowledge and oversight of its plans to hire 50 diverse candidates to executive positions and its development of artificial intelligence-based tools to track the career development of women and minorities at the company.  According to IBM, knowledge of this \u201chighly confidential, proprietary, and competitively sensitive information\u201d would allow Microsoft to compete for the same talent and business from customers that value diversity.  Once synonymous with white men in dark suits, IBM created task forces in 1995 to address the issue and soon greatly increased the diversity of its management.  Y-Vonne Hutchinson, an Oakland, California-based diversity consultant and lawyer who works with the tech industry, said IBM has had a legitimate edge over its industry rivals when it comes to diversity.  IBM\u2019s tools for reaching it diversity goals could qualify as trade secrets if it can show they are valuable to competitors, said Villanova University law professor Michael Risch.  IBM said in a statement that it \u201chas a long history of being recognized for leadership in a diverse and inclusive workplace.\u201d  Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft, which is not named in IBM\u2019s lawsuit, said it had no interest in IBM\u2019s confidential information.  \u2018PUBLIC CONDEMNATION\u2019  Russell Beck, a lawyer specializing in trade secrets law, said he was surprised to see IBM make such nakedly economic arguments about diversity, noting that corporations more typically cast their efforts as benefiting society as a whole.  Most large tech firms have long faced criticism for the lack of diversity of their staffs. IBM took a shot at Microsoft in its lawsuit, noting that the latter company has faced \u201cpublic condemnation and class action litigation\u201d for its struggles to recruit and promote women.  Microsoft is seeking to dismiss as without merit a class action alleging pay and promotion discrimination.  Microsoft and IBM both derive much of their revenue from selling software and cloud computing services to big companies, a number of which have said they seek diversity in their vendors and suppliers.  Other tech companies have previously argued for the confidentiality of diversity information, though more out of fear of public criticism and litigation than competition, said John Cary Sims, a professor at McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento, California.  But more have recently embraced transparency. In 2014, Google released diversity data after previously trying to keep it private. Apple and Microsoft have also made their data public.  Joelle Emerson, a consultant who has advised Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and Airbnb Inc on diversity efforts, criticized IBM\u2019s position.  \u201cIf you truly want to build a better industry, sharing learnings is actually a really helpful part of that,\u201d she said.  \u201cUltimately, a more diverse tech industry benefits every company within that industry.\u201d", "stock": "IBM", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-14", "source": "reuters", "url": "https://ca.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idCAKCN1FY38Z-OCATC"}, {"article": "(Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) sued its former executive Lindsay-Rae McIntyre, who was named Microsoft Corp\u2019s (MSFT.O) new chief diversity officer over the weekend, alleging violation of a one-year non-competitive agreement.

REUTERS/Chris Helgren/File Photo  The global shipping industry has seen little innovation since the container was invented in the 1950s, and cross-border trade still leaves an enormous trail of paperwork and bureaucracy.  Success of the platform, which will be made available to the ocean shipping industry around mid-2018, depends on whether Maersk and IBM can convince shippers, freight forwarders, ocean carriers, ports and customs authorities to sign up.  Blockchain technology powers the digital currency bitcoin and enables data sharing across a network of individual computers.  It will help manage and track tens of millions of shipping containers globally by digitizing the supply chain process from end to end, the companies said.  \u201cThe big thing that is missing from this industry to digitize and unleash the potential of the technology is really to create a form of utility that brings standards across the entire ecosystem,\u201d Maersk\u2019s Chief Commercial Officer Vincent Clerc said in an interview.

His conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., reported that it cut its stake in Big Blue by 94 percent during the fourth quarter, essentially drawing to a close a rare blemish on his investing record.  The move was disclosed in a regulatory filing Wednesday that also showed Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire increased its investment in Apple Inc., now valued at nearly $28 billion. And it initiated a new holding in Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., worth about $365 million, in the final three months of last year.  IBM was always a curiosity for Buffett followers. He\u2019d spent years telling them that technology companies were outside his area of expertise then plowed more than $10 billion into the company in 2011.  Flawed Valuation  Back then, Buffett\u2019s investment was a huge vote of confidence for the aging computer-services firm and its leadership. But things soon went south. IBM struggled with declining sales, forcing Buffett to defend the pick. For awhile, he even added some to his holdings.  Last year, however, he\u2019d had enough. Just before Berkshire\u2019s annual meeting in May, he acknowledged that his valuation had been flawed and that he\u2019d begun to cut back on the investment.  Buffett had hinted he might sell additional IBM shares before the end of last year. Since some of the stock traded below his purchase price, it would have been advantageous for Berkshire to recognize a loss when tax rates were higher, he said this January. Berkshire\u2019s stake in the company stood at just 2 million shares at the end of December, which have a market value of about $309 million.  Missed Opportunities  The episode has highlighted just how badly Buffett missed opportunities in tech companies that have come to dominate the ranks of the world\u2019s most valuable enterprises. At the annual meeting, he issued a mea culpa, adding that he \u201cblew it\u201d by failing to invest early in Google despite having plenty of chances to learn about and understand its business model.  In a sign of his new thinking, Buffett plowed billions of dollars into Apple starting in 2016. He added more to that investment in the fourth quarter, boosting Berkshire\u2019s total stake in the iPhone maker by 23 percent to about 165 million shares.  While much smaller, Berkshire\u2019s new investment in Teva may capture investor attention. The drugmaker has lost more than two-thirds of its value in the last two years. New Chief Executive Officer Kare Schultz has been making major changes since taking over in November. He\u2019s told investors to brace for an ugly ride that won\u2019t be over this year, and gave a 2018 earnings forecast far below investors\u2019 expectations.  To clean up some of the company\u2019s more than $30 billion in debt, Schultz said he\u2019ll cut about 25 percent of jobs at the company -- a step that past CEOs have been unwilling to take given Teva\u2019s close ties to its home market in Israel. He\u2019s also reorganized the drugmaker\u2019s management, and said it will eliminate some money-losing products.  After Berkshire\u2019s new holding was disclosed, Teva\u2019s American Depository Receipts surged 8 percent.  Some other notable changes to Berkshire\u2019s portfolio:  The stake in Bank of New York Mellon Corp. climbed 21 percent to 60.8 million shares  The holding in Monsanto Co. rose 32 percent to 11.7 million shares  The holding in American Airlines Group Inc. was lowered by 1 million shares to 46 million.  \u2014 With assistance by Drew Armstrong", "stock": "IBM", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-14", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-14/warren-buffett-s-berkshire-cuts-almost-its-entire-stake-in-ibm"}, {"article": "Canada plans to scrap a major IBM federal payroll plan that created chaos for thousands of government workers and will have cost the government almost C$1 billion ($780 million) by the time it\u2019s over.  The Phoenix project was originally chosen by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s Conservative predecessors 10 years ago to centralize the government payroll. International Business Machines Corp. won the contract to install and help run the system, which uses Oracle Corp. software.  It went live in 2016, just months after Trudeau won office. From the beginning, it didn\u2019t work like it was supposed to. Some people were paid too much, others not at all. Those issues snowballed with the deluge of requests to fix incorrect paychecks. The fear of not getting paid still hangs over the country\u2019s more than 260,000 federal public servants. Some put off major financial decisions. Others declined promotions or retirement, fearing any change in their pay could cause more trouble.  Two years later, some employees are still having problems. The latest data showed a backlog of 384,000 cases linked to the program.  IBM said it\u2019s \u201cfulfilling its obligations on the Phoenix contract, and the software is functioning as intended.\u201d The company \u201ccontinues to work in partnership with the government\u2019s efforts to resolve the project\u2019s issues, and remains committed to the project\u2019s overall success,\u201d it said in a statement.  An Oracle representative declined to comment.  Debi Daviau, president of one of the main unions representing government workers, said the blame falls mostly on the senior government officials who ran the project and opened it even though there were glaring warning signs it wasn\u2019t ready. But she also questions why IBM went ahead when it was clear there would be problems, and why the company benefits from a project that never worked as promised.  \u201cThey should have known better,\u201d Daviau said in an interview. When the company\u2019s warnings that more testing was needed went unheeded, IBM didn\u2019t put its foot down and hold up the project until it was ready, she said.  \u201cIBM got into a contract with the government that was very beneficial to IBM, which meant that the contract -- despite non-delivery -- could continue to be extended and IBM could continue to come back to the pot for money,\u201d she said.  Treasury Board President Scott Brison has said IBM has a responsibility to help the government fix the program.  \u201cIBM, as a sophisticated global company, needs to recognize that we as the government of Canada are not just an important client for IBM but there is reputational risk for IBM in not helping us fix this,\u201d Brison said last June during an appearance at the Senate\u2019s finance committee.  The fiasco illustrates how difficult it is to bring governments into the 21st century when it comes to technology, and the risks and limitations faced by companies like IBM, who get a large amount of their business from governments. IBM, based in Armonk, New York, doesn\u2019t disclose how much of its revenue comes from government contracts.  It\u2019s not the first time IBM has been embroiled in a payroll system disaster. The Australian state of Queensland scrapped a similar project after an initial contract went off the rails and ended up costing the government around A$1 billion ($772 million) to fix. A public inquiry mostly blamed government officials, but determined IBM shouldn\u2019t have been chosen for the job. IBM disputed some of the inquiry\u2019s findings in 2013.  Canadian Finance Minister Bill Morneau said Wednesday that the previous government made mistakes in dismissing staff needed to implement Phoenix but that, \u201cit\u2019s not about seeking blame, it\u2019s about trying to get it right.\u201d  Canada announced Tuesday it would start moving away from Phoenix and set aside money to find a new solution. The government will spend C$431 million to keep the program running in the near term, on top of C$460 million already spent to put Phoenix in place and fix the problems it generated.  The project was meant to save costs by firing 1,200 employees handling payroll at various departments around the country and replacing them with about 500 people in a centralized location using Phoenix to handle most of the government\u2019s payroll needs.  An inquiry from Canada\u2019s auditor general, a position similar to the U.S. Government Accountability Office, found many of the new employees were poorly trained and overworked. The software platform itself, a heavily modified version of Oracle\u2019s PeopleSoft program, had yet to be encoded with many of the payroll complexities faced by a massive and diverse public service, such as unique shift rules for Coast Guard officers or prison guards.  Phoenix is a classic example of a government wanting to save money on an expensive new technology project by cutting the number of employees working on it, only to discover later that those people were essential to seeing it through, said Nigel Wallis, a vice president with research firm IDC Canada. Other companies considered the project and decided against bidding because it looked too complex, but IBM went ahead, Wallis said.    \u201cThe promise of short term savings are often illusory,\u201d Wallis said \u201cThat\u2019s a real issue not just for government but also for a lot of large scale technology transformations. You need to approach them with a level of seriousness that I don\u2019t think necessarily was done in this instance.\u201d  Most major technology change-over projects -- for the private and public sectors -- either fail or face significant challenges, according to researcher Standish Group, which tracks thousands of projects every year.  On Wednesday, a New Democratic Party representative stood up in Parliament to ask Trudeau what he was doing for one of her constituents who was out C$40,000.  \u201cWe didn\u2019t create this mess,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cBut we are going to fix it.\u201d  \u2014 With assistance by Josh Wingrove, and Nico Grant", "stock": "IBM", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-01", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-01/canada-to-scrap-ibm-payroll-plan-gone-awry-costing-c-1-billion"}, {"article": "IBM and A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S have started a company that will use new technologies such as blockchain, a digital ledger best known for underpinning bitcoin, to track cargo movements and automate paperwork for shipping across international borders.  Maersk, the Danish conglomerate that owns the world\u2019s largest container shipping line, will be the first to use the new platform, while International Business Machines Corp. will provide the back end and support for the technology. The new company said it expects to sign up large shippers, ports and customs officials for the service, set to become available in the second half of 2018.  The IBM-Maersk joint venture, which will be based in the New York City area, named Michael White, former president of Maersk Line in North America, as chief executive officer. Maersk will own 51 percent of the new company, with the rest of the stake belonging to IBM, the companies said Tuesday in announcing the new venture. The two companies started testing blockchain technology for the cargo supply business in June 2016.  On its first day, the new firm will track 18 percent of ocean containerized trade, White said in a phone interview. It will need merger approval from regulators, he said.  \u201cTechnology is changing everything about our world today, and it\u2019s about time to let it change our business,\u201d White said, adding that the company will also use web-connected devices and newest analytics technologies. \u201cWe think we can lower the cost of global trade.\u201d  Blockchain has become a key bet for IBM as the Armonk, New York-based company seeks to sell more of its software delivered through its cloud server infrastructure.

The distortion this time, though, reflects the perils of trading in new issues with thin liquidity rather than the crypto mania, according to Josh Lukeman, head of ETF market making in the Americas at Credit Suisse AG.

Now it\u2019s got a comeback plan, but some investors don\u2019t buy it.  China\u2019s erstwhile tech darling, which lost its perch atop the PC market to HP Inc. in 2017, has shed two-thirds of its value since hitting a 15-year high in 2015. At a two-year earnings multiple of about 10 times, its stock is cheapest among the world\u2019s largest computer makers. Yet all seven analysts ranked best by Bloomberg based on one-year returns urge investors to sell. Their average target puts Lenovo 13 percent below Tuesday\u2019s close.  From money-hemorrhaging businesses to resurgent competition for its cash-cow PC division and a revolving-door executive team, the company that once aspired to Apple and Samsung\u2019s heights seems to have lost its way. Chief Executive Officer Yang Yuanqing\u2019s failed repeatedly to deliver on turnaround deadlines and hasn\u2019t fully articulated a strategy to revive ailing mobile and datacenter arms -- even as local rivals gun for its bread-and-butter Chinese customer base.

The company that wants to buy computer-chip maker Qualcomm Inc. got a dose of unwanted news earlier this week. The committee that reviews foreign corporations' acquisitions of American companies wrote an extraordinary letter to Broadcom that said, essentially, that the U.S. government is not inclined to look kindly on a combination of Singapore-based Broadcom and Qualcomm.  Reading between the lines of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., at least some U.S. government officials are worried about the potential for China -- and particularly China's telecom equipment powerhouse Huawei -- to dictate the next generation of mobile internet technology, known as 5G. And the committee is concerned that Broadcom and its cost-cutting reputation won't be a good steward of great American hope Qualcomm, which is expected to play a critical role in the development of 5G and has strong ties to the U.S. government.  The merits of CFIUS's argument are debatable, but it's clear that Broadcom has walked into a political minefield in which the U.S. government's fear of China dominating technology standards is working against it. The company's rebuttal to CFIUS takes all those complicated political ingredients and turns them into clumsy Broadcom Jell-O.  Wrong Direction Broadcom's share price has dipped this year, indicating some investor concerns about the company's proposed Qualcomm takeover Source: Bloomberg  Broadcom pledged in a statement released on Wednesday to \"make the U.S. a global leader in 5G,\" but it was vague about how it would go about it. The company said it would maintain the research-and-development resources that Qualcomm has devoted to 5G and \"focus\" the investment to technologies that \"are essential to the U.S.\" Again, there are few specifics. That fits with Broadcom's inflexibility and vagueness in other aspects of its Qualcomm deal talks, including the uncertainty of antitrust scrutiny.  Broadcom tried to tackle one of the committee's main points by saying the company has a \"proven track record of managing R&D for maximum impact.\" But that's a euphemism for reduced spending, and CFIUS is worried that Broadcom's playbook of slashing spending at companies it acquires would weaken Qualcomm's ability to be on the vanguard of 5G technology. Broadcom most likely couldn't address this point more aggressively because the company is stretching its financial limits in the attempted $100 billion acquisition of Qualcomm and knows it must cut costs to make the deal work.  Broadcom in its letter also pledged to create a $1.5 billion fund to train engineers that would hone America's edge in wireless technology. This has all the hallmarks of companies' typical pledges when they're trying to score political points and perhaps have no plans to follow through.  IBM, also with political goals in mind, announced in late 2016 a $1 billion fund to train American workers in technology areas. If all these announcements come through, America will have the best and most expensive workforce in the world. But they won't. At least Broadcom didn't mention the mysterious $20 billion that President Trump said the company's incorporation in the U.S. would somehow deliver to American cities and workers.  A Penny for Your Thoughts Broadcom gets only a small percentage of its revenue from the U.S. Its 2017 purchase of Brocade will add about $1 billion more in North America revenue. That's still nowhere near $20 billion. Source: Bloomberg  Broadcom also waved its U.S. flag vigorously by saying it's part of the lineage of iconic American technology companies that also includes Hewlett-Packard ... and Brocade (acquired by Broadcom)? Yes, I'm sure every child in Silicon Valley knows the founding history of Broadcom and Brocade. Allow me to suggest substitutions for actually iconic American technology companies: IBM, Apple, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, Google and Facebook.  Maybe Broadcom thinks it can afford to be inept in its dealings with CFIUS because the committee won't matter. In the worst kind of political theater, Broadcom said last year that it planned to shift its official home country from Singapore to the U.S. That pending shift has the advantage of possibly removing CFIUS from the picture because Broadcom won't be a \"foreign\" acquirer anymore.  Broadcom reiterated in its statement on Wednesday that it expects that home country swap to be completed no later than May 6. A Qualcomm shareholder election that is a proxy vote on the Broadcom takeover was delayed until early April because of CFIUS's interest. It's possible Broadcom can string this all this along and hope the apparent antipathy of Qualcomm stockholders toward company management and the board can carry Broadcom to acquisition victory.  Whether this acquisition happens or not, both Qualcomm and Broadcom have been damaged. For Qualcomm, the takeover tussle fueled shareholders who were worried and angry about the company's fights with customers and regulators. Broadcom's acquisition play has exposed the limits of the company's acquire-at-all-costs blueprint and showed the company's tendency to be ham-handed politically when it needs to be adroit.  -- with assistance from Gadfly's Brooke Sutherland  This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.", "stock": "IBM", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-07", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2018-03-07/broadcom-trips-up-in-a-political-minefield-on-qualcomm"}, {"article": "Lenovo Group Ltd. has a serious problem on its hands.  It's a problem that could wipe out this year's earnings and even threaten profits next year and beyond.  Despite spending more than $5 billion in a series of acquisitions four years ago, Lenovo's attempts to bolster its mobile and server businesses haven't amounted to much. Its income statement has shown management's flailing attempts to make good on promises, which included wringing a profit out of its new mobile division within six quarters of purchase, and reaching $5 billion in annual sales from its server (aka enterprise) division.  Chronic Fatigue Lenovo's mobile and server businesses haven't made a profit since acquisitions aimed at bolstering both divisions Source: Lenovo, Bloomberg  But investors focusing on Lenovo's P&L may be missing an iceberg on its balance sheet. Lenovo paid massive premiums for the Motorola Mobility smartphone and IBM server businesses in 2014, and the goodwill section of the balance sheet is where these markups sit. This is common, because buyers usually bid up the value of the assets they're pursuing, and you can think of goodwill as the \"overpaid\" column in the spreadsheet. For Lenovo, the result was a sudden doubling to more than $5.2 billion.  Too Good Lenovo's goodwill ballooned after a series of acquisitions that were supposed to boost revenue and profits in its smaller units Source: Bloomberg  Buying assets and booking goodwill isn't a problem if the new divisions add value, usually through profits, or economies of scale that boost margins or cut costs. With the Motorola and IBM acquisitions, though, that clearly wasn't the case. So it's more likely than not that the current fair value of those units is less than the carrying amount Lenovo ascribes to them.  Breaking It Down Half of Lenovo's goodwill sits in divisions that are chronically unprofitable Source: Lenovo, Bloomberg Gadfly, Bloomberg  I choose these words carefully, because \"more likely than not\" is the term the Financial Accounting Standards Board uses to assess whether a goodwill impairment needs to be made. The IFRS Foundation, which also issues financial reporting guidelines, is a little more blunt in its IAS36 standard:  An asset must not be carried in the financial statements at more than the highest amount to be recovered through its use or sale.  Among the indications of impairment, according to the accounting firm Deloitte LLP, is whether the asset returns \"worse economic performance than expected.\"  There's absolutely no doubt, based on management's previous public statements, that those units bought at a cost of $5 billion are performing worse than expected. What's extraordinary is that after four years Lenovo hasn't recognized such impairment and allows the goodwill to sit on the balance sheet.  Reporting standards only require a test of goodwill to be done annually, so it's reasonable not to see anything announced in the past few quarters. But the company's financial year is coming to an end March 31, so the clock is ticking.  You can understand management's reticence. After a slew of deals in the late 2000s, Acer Inc., a Taiwanese PC maker, clung to inflated goodwill figures despite clear signs that the acquisitions weren't bearing fruit. In the end, it had to conduct an IAS36 impairment test and recognized a NT$9.4 billion ($335 million) writedown, enough to plunge Acer into a record annual loss and spur the ousting of its chairman and CEO.  That impairment was equivalent to about 24 percent of Acer's total intangible assets at the time. For Lenovo, I calculate it would take a mere 10.3 percent writedown to push it into a loss for the current fiscal year -- and that's only for an impairment on goodwill, and only at the mobile and server divisions. A deeper, 20 percent impairment on those units would bring about a record annual loss.  Knife Edge It would take only a small impairment of its goodwill to push Lenovo into a full-year loss for the current fiscal year Source: Bloomberg Gadfly  When Lenovo reports third-quarter earnings this week, expect management to focus again on its awesome PC division, and to continue talking up the prospects of the mobile and server units.

IBM launched Watson Assistant, an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered voice assistant for businesses seeking to infuse voice technology into their products, at its annual Think conference on Tuesday.  IBM will license Watson Assistant to enterprises so they can build personalized, interactive experiences into their own products and services that appeal to their customers.  IBM's announcement follows Amazon's November 2017 launch of Alexa for Business platform, which enables businesses to create their own Alexa skills for both practical and business use cases.  Watson Assistant has a heightened focus on customization and privacy over voice competitors like Google and Amazon, which could make it more likely to win over businesses than Alexa or Google Assistant.  It allows for personalization to help businesses better tailor their voice interactions . Developers can create custom voice activation commands and triggers for Watson Assistant, eliminating the need for a standard universal wake word, such as \"Alexa\" or \"OK Google.\" Additionally, businesses can train their assistants using their own datasets, making it easier to build actions and commands.  Developers can create custom voice activation commands and triggers for Watson Assistant, eliminating the need for a standard universal wake word, such as \"Alexa\" or \"OK Google.\" Additionally, businesses can train their assistants using their own datasets, making it easier to build actions and commands. It gives users control over their personal data. Each integration of Watson Assistant exclusively holds the data it gathers, which ensures that companies, including IBM, aren't pooling information on users' activities across various applications. Additionally, consumers have control over which Watson-powered applications and devices can access each other's data through the IBM cloud, which enables the tech to learn from their actions and remember their preferences.

IBM's results call after U.S. markets closed on Thursday forecast an operating profit of at least $13.80 per share for 2018, compared with $13.80 in 2017 and market expectations of $13.92, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  The outlook came on the back of the computing services and hardware firm's first quarterly revenue growth in six years.  \"While slight growth is a modest positive, we were largely underwhelmed by IBM's results, and felt the numbers showed IBM has much more work to do to turn the ship around,\" Deutsche Bank analyst Sherri Scribner wrote in a client note.  IBM's 3.6 percent revenue growth came mostly from a 71 percent jump in sales of its new Z14 mainframe, which was launched in September, and a 27 percent growth in its cloud business.  Several analysts pointed to the traditionally cyclical nature of mainframe revenues, which tend to surge for 2-4 quarters after the launch of a new launch before falling off.  But some said the growth since IBM launched its Z14 in September hinted at a different outcome.  Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty said the new mainframe's heightened focus on security was attracting more new customers and workloads rather than just upgrades at a time when cyberattacks and chip vulnerability are at the top of buyer's list of concerns.  A growth in the mainframe business might also improve IBM's margins. The company's fourth-quarter adjusted gross margins of 49.5 percent fell short of market expectations of 50.8 percent.  IBM has been moving away from its shrinking hardware and software businesses to what it calls \"strategic imperatives,\" which includes the contribution of cloud computing - where companies use a remote network of data centers instead of their own hardware to cut costs.  Strategic Imperatives grew 14 percent in the quarter.  \"Looking under the surface, however, it appears that strategic imperatives excluding Systems only grew 6 percent, largely driven by the lack of Cognitive Solutions growth,\" Berenberg analyst Josep Bori said.  \"This is clearly not enough to offset the declining core business,\" he said.  IBM said it would continue to \"maintain a high level of investment\" in 2018 as it boosts its capabilities on cloud, mobile, cybersecurity and data analytics.  \"This quarter was another important step in the right direction with 2018 a major prove me year for IBM to show the turnaround story is viable, which we believe it is, albeit at a snail-like pace,\" GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives said.

Youtube  At a congressional hearing this week, Jerry Cuomo, IBM's vice president of blockchain technology, testified about the potential governmental uses for blockchains.  Identification documents, payment systems, and systems that trace the movement of foods and drugs, are among the most promising initial governmental applications for the technology, Cuomo said.  Lawmakers were wowed by how much quicker blockchain technology has made the process of tracking down food products.  IBM wants to get Uncle Sam on a blockchain.  The digital ledger technology that underlies bitcoin is ready to be used for everything from paying taxes to tracking food and drug shipments to newer, more secure identification cards, said Jerry Cuomo, vice president of blockchain technology at IBM, at a hearing Wednesday organized by the Congressional Blockchain Caucus.  \"There is an opportunity for the United States to build upon its momentum to lead blockchain by doing,\" Cuomo said in his testimony. \"We should focus our efforts on projects that can positively impact US economic competitiveness, citizens, and businesses.\"  Cuomo encouraged lawmakers to focus on incorporating blockchain technology into already established governmental projects and programs, rather than trying to start new blockchain-themed initiatives. That could help speed its use and adoption and help the US stay at the forefront of blockchain development, he said.  Government agencies at both the federal and state level are already experimenting with the technology. Some states are developing blockchain-based drivers licenses and identification cards. Meanwhile, IBM is working with the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on some blockchain projects, including one that could speed the CDC's ability to develop new drugs.  Right now, drug development involves lots of paperwork. Blockchain technology could help improve the process by putting all of the important information related to drug development in an easily accessible and secure place online.  Developing new drugs \"doesn't just take a long time because people are slow,\" Cuomo said. \"The processes are extremely paper intensive. I see these groups taking the right first steps.\"  In an interview with Business Insider, Cuomo predicted that blockchain-based digital identities will be the first big project to take off at the federal level, because officials can build off the work going on in the states.  In addition to Cuomo, Frank Yiannas, vice president of food safety at Walmart, also testified at the hearing, talking about how his company is using blockchain technology. The retail giant has teamed up with IBM to develop a blockchain designed to track the movement of produce from farmers through distributors and stores to consumers. The technology could be useful in responding to reports of food contamination, when entities like the FDA need to quickly determine which food to recall.  When Yiannas told lawmakers that the process of tracking down particular food products has gone from seven days to to 2.2 seconds, thanks to blockchain technology, they were in awe, Cuomo said.

Microsoft  IBM wanted Microsoft to provide games for its original PC \u2014 so Bill Gates took the task upon himself, working late into the night to produce the first PC game ever.  The game Gates and company came up with was \"DONKEY.BAS,\" an extremely simple and silly game about a car dodging donkeys in the road.  When Apple got their first look at the IBM PC, they thought \"DONKEY.BAS\" was particularly embarrassing, to the point where they couldn't believe Gates put his name on it.  It's the stuff of Silicon Valley legend: In 1980, a young Bill Gates convinced IBM that his tiny startup, Microsoft, was the perfect choice to provide the operating system for its new PC.  The problem was that Microsoft didn't actually have an operating system to sell. So Gates scrambled to buy one from a startup working on an operating system called 86-DOS, or \"disk operating system.\" It renamed the software PC DOS and sold it to IBM for $430,000 total.  As part of the deal, though, IBM wanted Microsoft to provide a version of BASIC, a programming language for beginners, along with a few simple games to show it off. What it came up with was \"DONKEY.BAS,\" a silly game about a car that has to avoid donkeys in the road.  It also happens to be the first PC game ever developed. Behold:  (The \".BAS\" part just means that it was written in BASIC.)  Here's how Gates described the process of building \"DONKEY.BAS\" in a 2001 keynote:  \"Actually, it was myself and Neil Konzen at four in the morning with this prototype IBM PC sitting in this small room. IBM insisted that we had to have a lock on the door, and we only had this closet that had a lock on it, so we had to do all our development in there, and it was always over 100 degrees, but we wrote late at night a little application to show what the BASIC built into the IBM PC could do. And so that was DONKEY.BAS. It was, at the time, very thrilling.\"  Andy Hertzfeld, an early Apple employee, memorably recalled the first time the Macintosh team saw an IBM PC and being especially unimpressed with the selection of games onboard. He singled out \"DONKEY.BAS\" as the \"most embarrassing game,\" saying that \"the concept of the game was as bad the crude graphics that it used.\"  Hertzfeld said of discovering this terrible game was made by none other than Gates:  \"We were surprised to see that the comments at the top of the game proudly proclaimed the authors: Bill Gates and Neil Konzen. Neil was a bright teenage hacker who I knew from his work on the Apple II (who would later become Microsoft's technical lead on the Mac project) but we were amazed that such a thoroughly bad game could be coauthored by Microsoft's cofounder, and that he would actually want to take credit for it in the comments.\"  In 2001, to show off how far the company had come, Microsoft built a 3D version of \"DONKEY.BAS,\" called \"DONKEY.NET,\" where the aim is to hit donkeys with a car. You can download a version of it, but it's difficult to get running on modern systems.  The IBM PC. Wikimedia Commons  But if you want to play the original \"DONKEY.BAS,\" you're in luck. MIT is hosting a browser-based version, while an enterprising developer built an iPhone and Apple Watch version that you can buy for 99 cents. You can also play another early DOS game, \"GORILLAS.BAS,\" in the browser.  Gates became a massive fan of another classic Microsoft game: He was such a fan of Minesweeper that he had to delete it from his computer to stay productive \u2014 still, he would end up sneaking into his executives' offices to play it.", "stock": "IBM", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-02", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://uk.businessinsider.com/bill-gates-donkey-bas-game-2017-2?r=US&amp;IR=T"}, {"article": "IBM CEO Ginni Rometty IBM  IBM told investors Thursday that it has over 400 clients with projects on its blockchain platform.  Among its biggest clients are companies like Walmart and Nestl\u00e9. It also disclosed a list of banks and trade companies using its blockchain.  Blockchain technology is often associated with cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, but enterprises are taking it on as a new tool for trade and payments.  IBM's foray into blockchain technology is catching on with customers, according to an investor briefing shared by the company on Thursday.  At least 400 IBM customers are now running blockchain-based projects, according to the briefing. Among those customers are 63 that work together with certain themes: 25 companies in global trade, 14 companies in food tracking, and 14 companies in global payments. Some of IBM's most recognizable blockchain clients include Nestl\u00e9, Visa, Walmart, and HSBC.  While blockchains continue to be widely associated with startups and crypto-millionaires, IBM's client list shows that large enterprises are truly embracing the technology.  IBM and Walmart actually launched a joint food safety blockchain project globally last year, which enables the grocery chain to figure out where specific produce originated in a matter of seconds.  Why the blockchain?  Blockchains, the technology that underlies cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, have caught on in enterprise as an efficient and comprehensive way of tracking both physical and digital items \u2014 from inventory to online payments. Often, these blockchains are decentralized, meaning they're spread across many machines on a network. This redundancy makes it difficult for any one party to falsify the information contained on the blockchain.  Conventionally, blockchains like the one that powers bitcoin are public, so that anyone can see the changes that are made. It's an important aspect of most cryptocurrencies that the blockchain is accessible to all, to eliminate the possibility of shady dealings.  But IBM's product, which is built on top of an open-source blockchain called Hyperledger Fabric, uses \"permissioned networks.\" This means companies can have some of the information on their bespoke blockchain be publicly viewable, and some of it locked behind a password or other security mechamism.  A global trader like the Dow Chemical Company (an IBM blockchain user) may want to have an immutable receipt between itself and its trade partners in order to guarantee that no one is being scammed. But it doesn't necessarily want that information to be viewable by its competitors \u2014 or, say, the media.  In global shipping, IBM's clients include Maersk, Du Pont and Dow Chemical. Its food trust customers include Walmart, Nestl\u00e9, Kroger and Unilever. Its global payment customers include Visa, the Polynesian payments company KlickEx, EarthPort, Nab,, BBVA and CIBC. And in trade finance, IBM's customers include Societe General, WeTrade, HSBC, Unicredit, and Santander.  They're not the only ones rushing towards the blockchain, either. JD.com, the Amazon of China, is launching a project to put high-end beef imports on a blockchain so that its customers can see where their meat has been.

Anne McKee started coding just three years ago with a class at a local community college.  McKee was one of three global winners among 17,000 students that participated in this year's competition.  Mainframes are still widely in use at banks, insurance companies, and other big businesses that handle lots of credit card transactions.  You might think of the mainframe computer as long-gone relic of the Cold War. But banks, especially, still rely on modern versions of the old classic: They're huge and old-fashioned, sure, but they're also proven to be mega-reliable.  Fast forward to today, and meet Anna McKee, a 22-year-old college senior at the University of North Texas, who was named the winner of the IBM Master of the Mainframe programming contest last week \u2014 making her the first woman from North America to take the title.  \"I started saying 'oh my gosh' repeatedly and my poor parents who I was on the phone with thought I got into a car accident or something,\" McKee told Business Insider, of the moment she won. \"And then they just started yelling on the other end. They were so excited. It was awesome.\"  McKee was, truly, shocked that she would win. She had only started coding three years earlier, starting with a class at a local community college. She entered the contest thinking she would have a hard time even completing it. She never thought she actually stood a chance. In fact, she only competed because both of her parents work with mainframes, and urged her to enter.  Her prizes: A $2,750 travel stipend to go to the closest IBM head office to meet with executives and recruiters; an HTC Vive virtual reality headset; a \"Master of the Mainframe\" hoodie.  The learning curve  The mainframe might have fallen out of favor, as PCs, smartphones, and now cloud computing give people access to so much computing power in much smaller packages. The problem is that, even though mainframes are still so critical at many businesses, programming novices are getting drawn to the newer platforms, causing a huge skills shortage.  That's part of why IBM has run the Master of the Mainframe competition since 2005, as a way to entice students to learn the intracicies of the mainframe.  \"We really want to give students a learning opportunity on one of the world's biggest enterprise IT platforms,\" Meredith Stowell, director of community engagement and skills for IBM's Mainframe team, told Business Insider.  One of IBM's more modern zEnterprise mainframes. IBM zEnterprise System mainframe  This year saw the biggest turnout in the contest's history: 17,000 students, 23% of which were women, all competed McKee was the only woman to place among the 15 global and regional winners.  \"I had no idea I was the the first female win in North America,\" said McKee. \"I was just trying to do the best I could.\"  Master of the Mainframe  The Master of the Mainframe competition takes the form of three rounds of challenges, culminating in a stage that requires contestants to build their own application by sorting and tracking data from over 600 companies. Contestants connect to a IBM mainframe virtually, from a terminal on their own computer.  Contestants have three months to complete the Master of the Mainframe challenge. McKee finished in two weeks.  \"I worked day and night to complete it,\" McKee said. \"Everything else, my homework and everything, was put on the back burner.\"  In high school, McKee was particularly adept at math and music, but didn't know how that could translate into a career. On a whim, during the summer after her freshman year of college, McKee enrolled in a basic C++ programming course at a nearby community college. She struggled through it, but she was \"intrigued\" and decided to sign up for a class in the Java programming language. IBM  That's when things changed. She enjoyed programming in Java so much, she declared a major in business computer information systems. She also joined the Association for Information Systems, a professional association for the IT industry.  And she's noticed a promising change, too. Over the past year, McKee said, more women have been attending AIS meetings. A few weeks before IBM told McKee she won Master of the Mainframe, she noticed something unusual at the latest AIS meeting: the room was about 50% women.  \"It's something that really surprised me and I really hope that things are shifting so that more women are getting into technology,\" she said.", "stock": "IBM", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-25", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/ibm-master-of-the-mainframe-winner-anna-mccay-interview-2018-3"}, {"article": "IBM today announced a partnership with low-code development platform Mendix that will bring Mendix and native integration with many of IBM\u2019s Watson IoT and AI services to the IBM Cloud.

With this partnership, IBM is bringing Mendix to the IBM Cloud and integrating it deeply with its own tools. As Don Boulia, the general manager for the IBM Cloud Platform, told me, the typical developer on the IBM platform doesn\u2019t quite fit the profile of somebody who would opt for a low-code/no-code platform like Mendix, but this move allows IBM to go after a segment of the developer population that includes exactly this group of users who currently don\u2019t have the option/ability to use IBM\u2019s cloud services (as well as more advanced developers who simply want to build a quick prototype).  By bringing Mendix to its cloud, IBM clearly hopes to attract more users to the wide variety of services it now offers.

Using the Mendix connector kit, developers also will be able to access IBM\u2019s IoT and blockchain services.  Once you start getting into IBM\u2019s IoT and blockchain APIs, though, chances are that you\u2019ll have to go beyond the visual development tools to get the full value out of these tools.

Watson, at its core, is simply an artificial intelligence engine and while that\u2019s not trivial by any means, neither is it the personified intelligence that their TV commercials would have the less technically savvy believe.  These commercials contribute to this unrealistic idea that humans can talk to machines in this natural fashion. You\u2019ve probably seen some. They show this symbol talking to humans in a robotic voice explaining its capabilities. Some of the humans include Bob Dylan, Serena Williams and Stephen King.  In spite of devices like Alexa and Google Home, we certainly don\u2019t have machines giving us detailed explanations, at least not yet.  IBM would probably be better served aiming its commercials at the enterprises it sells to, rather than the general public, who may be impressed by a talking box having a conversation with a star. However, those of us who have at least some understanding of the capabilities of such tech, and those who buy it, don\u2019t need such bells and whistles. We need much more practical applications. While chatting with Serena Williams about competitiveness may be entertaining, it isn\u2019t really driving home the actual value proposition of this tech for business.  The trouble with using Watson as a catch-all phrase is that it reduces the authenticity of the core technology behind it. It\u2019s not as though IBM is alone in trying to personify its AI though.

With this, he echoes similar statements all across the industry. Google\u2019s AI chief John Giannandrea, for example, also recently listed this as one of the main challenges the search giant\u2019s machine learning groups are trying to tackle. Typically, machine learning models need to be trained on large amounts of data to ensure that they are accurate, but for many problems, that large data set simply doesn\u2019t exist.  High, however, believes this is a solvable problem. Why? \u201cBecause humans do it. We have a data point,\u201d he said. One thing to keep in mind is that even when we see that evidenced in what humans are doing, you have to recognize it\u2019s not just that session, it\u2019s not just that moment that is informing how humans learn. We bring all of this context to the table.\u201d For High, it\u2019s this context that\u2019ll make possible training models with less data, as well as recent advances in transfer learning, that is, the ability to take one trained model and then use this data to kickstart the training of another model where less data may exist.  The challenges for AI \u2014 and especially conversational AI \u2014 go beyond that, though. \u201cOn the other end is really trying to understand how better to interact with humans in ways that they would find natural and that are influential to their thinking,\u201d says High. \u201cHumans are influenced by not just the words that they exchange but also by how we encase those words in vocalizations, inflection, intonation, cadence, temper, facial expression, arm and hand gestures.\u201d High doesn\u2019t think an AI necessarily needs to mimic these in some kind of anthropomorphic form, but maybe in some other form like visual cues on a device.  At the same time, most AI systems also still need to get better at understanding the intent of a question and how that relates to individuals\u2019 previous questions about something, as well as their current state of mind and personality.  That brings up another question, though. Many of these machine learning models that are in use right now are inherently biased because of the data with which they were trained. That often means that a given model will work great for you if you\u2019re a white male but then fails black women, for example. \u201cFirst of all, I think that there\u2019s two sides to that equation. One is, there may be aggregate bias to this data and we have to be sensitive to that and force ourselves to consider data that broadens the cultural and demographic aspects of the people it represents,\u201d said High. \u201cThe flip side of that, though, is that you actually want aggregate bias in these kind of systems over personal bias.\u201d  As an example, High cited work IBM did with the Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. IBM and the hospital trained a model based on the work of some of the best cancer surgeons. \u201cBut Sloan Kettering has a particular philosophy about how to do medicine. So that philosophy is embodied in their biases. It\u2019s their institutional biases, it\u2019s their brand. [\u2026] And any system that is going to be used outside of Sloan Kettering needs to carry that same philosophy forward.\u201d  \u201cA big part of making sure that these things are biased in the right way is both making sure that you have the right people submitting for and who these people are representative of \u2014 of the broader culture.\u201d That\u2019s a discussion that High says now regularly comes up with IBM\u2019s clients, too, which is a positive sign in an industry that still often ignores these kind of topics.", "stock": "IBM", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-27", "source": "techcrunch", "url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/02/27/ibm-watson-cto-rob-high-on-bias-and-other-challenges-in-machine-learning/"}, {"article": "IBM is hard at work on the problem of ubiquitous computing, and its approach, understandably enough, is to make a computer small enough that you might mistake it for a grain of sand. Eventually these omnipresent tiny computers could help authenticate products, track medications and more.  Look closely at the image above and you\u2019ll see the device both on that pile of salt and on the person\u2019s finger. No, not that big one. Look closer:  It\u2019s an evolution of IBM\u2019s \u201ccrypto anchor\u201d program, which uses a variety of methods to create what amounts to high-tech watermarks for products that verify they\u2019re, for example, from the factory the distributor claims they are, and not counterfeits mixed in with genuine items.  The \u201cworld\u2019s smallest computer,\u201d as IBM continually refers to it, is meant to bring blockchain capability into this; the security advantages of blockchain-based logistics and tracking could be brought to something as benign as a bottle of wine or box of cereal.  In addition to getting the computers extra-tiny, IBM intends to make them extra-cheap, perhaps 10 cents apiece. So there\u2019s not much of a lower limit on what types of products could be equipped with the tech.

This week at its Think 2018 Conference in Las Vegas, IBM showed off its own take on the growing smart assistant category, aimed firmly at enterprise applications. Naturally, the company\u2019s using the Watson name for the offering, and tacking on \u201cAssistant\u201d for good measure.  Unlike Alexa, Siri and Google\u2019s own offering of the same name, however, Watson Assistant won\u2019t be a chipper, consumer-facing offering loaded up on IBM-branded smart speakers. Rather, the company\u2019s plan here is to operate mostly behind the scenes, white labeling the technology for use by companies.  In fact, the offering is so behind-the-scenes that IBM\u2019s already rolled it out in a bunch of spots, including the Munich Airport and the Royal Bank of Scotland. The big Think unveiling also finds the company adding IFTTT as a partner along with Harman \u2014 a bit of an odd choice, given that its parent company has its own smart assistant. But then, Bixby is, well, Bixby.  The plan is to make Watson Assistant the foundation of voice-based offerings in places like hotel rooms, stores and cars, so company can leverage IBM\u2019s technology to build their own custom solutions.

And, it doesn\u2019t just respond to a person\u2019s commands and provide generic information that\u2019s publicly available.

But in its earnings call with analysts today, the company revealed it\u2019s pulling in a billion dollars a quarter in combined cloud revenue. That\u2019s a figure that Google\u2019s Diane Greene says already puts her company on elite footing, but which is substantially below what competitors have been reporting.  \u201cWe are saying we crossed a billion a quarter in 2017 and according to publicly available numbers, we are the fastest growing cloud. If you step back and think about someone offering services and that\u2019s revenue, that\u2019s pretty darn impressive. Not too many companies can make a claim like that. It already puts you in the elite of companies,\u201d Greene told TechCrunch.  It\u2019s worth noting that in Q4, Canalys reported that Microsoft had grown the fastest with 98 percent growth with Google second at 85 percent growth; still quite brisk, but not the fastest. While Greene wouldn\u2019t share specific data on how they came up with their number, she did say the company compared a range of publicly available data with their own internal numbers to come up with the \u201cfastest growing cloud\u201d label.  That may be so, but it\u2019s hard to ignore that a $4 billion run rate is not even equal to a quarter of revenue for any of Google\u2019s main cloud competitors. While it\u2019s hard to do a pure comparison of cloud revenue because there is no standard way of measuring it, we do know that Amazon reported AWS revenue today of $4.331 billion. Meanwhile, Microsoft passed a $20 billion total cloud run rate last year and IBM reported revenue of $17 billion in total cloud revenue for the year in its most recent earnings report, which breaks down to more than $4.25 billion a quarter.  In spite of this, John Dinsdale of Synergy Research, a firm that has been tracking the cloud market for some time says the number did not surprise him. \u201cAbsolutely no surprise on the $1B disclosure and it\u2019s in line with the size and trend of Google\u2019s cloud business that we have been reporting for a long time.\u201d Dinsdale told TechCrunch.  For her part, Greene sees progress. Besides the the rapid growth she cited, Google Cloud has passed major milestones like 4 million customers paying for G Suite and it has tripled the number of sales of a million dollars or more since 2016. All progress, she says, that points to a company that\u2019s growing more quickly than the billion-dollar revenue number would suggest in isolation.  Google has spent $30 billion in infrastructure investments over the last three years to build its data center presence around the world. It also has made a concerted effort to be a more developer-friendly cloud vendor and has contributed key software like Kubernetes to open source, a technology that surged in popularity in 2017.  Greene says this has removed a lot of market obstacles for Google, but that it takes some time for revenue to catch up with customers. \u201cThink about how the cloud works and they start moving over and the revenue takes awhile to start coming in,\u201d she explained.  She cited a long list of big-name customers who have come on board during her tenure, from enterprise technology players Salesforce, Cisco and SAP to a range of other industries, including Disney, Rolls Royce and PayPal.  It\u2019s also worth pointing out that customers don\u2019t typically choose a single cloud vendor, which means that each one can share the same customer.

But the group had made it clear to the White House that it would not be pleased with any measure that had tariffs \u201cas the primary or even a significant remedy.\u201d  \u201cThe reason is that it would be a tax on consumers,\u201d Mr. Kallmer said, \u201cprecisely the people we are trying to support.\u201d  Many of the trade measures that Mr. Trump has proposed, including the steel and aluminum tariffs, have divided his advisers, the business community and the Republican Party. But the White House has boasted that its targeting of China\u2019s trade practices has broad support from industries on the losing end of the Chinese approach.  That theory could make it more difficult for American companies to operate in a country that already puts up steep barriers.  American companies and business groups have frequently complained that China blocks off valuable markets from American competition, including technology, media and finance, and that it does so in violation of commitments it made when it joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. China has imposed regulations that require American companies to share their technology with Chinese partners, for example, mandating that foreign companies operate through joint ventures if they want access to Chinese consumers. At times, the Chinese have resorted to stealing vital technologies through cyberwarfare, according to United States authorities.  Late last month, the White House said it would crack down on that behavior, outlining a series of actions aimed at punishing China for its trade barriers.  As Mr. Trump advances a series of tough trade measures to confront these behaviors, however, cracks have appeared in American industry\u2019s seemingly united front.

Any American company that wants to be a global player cannot afford to lose access to China\u2019s growing market, executives say.  Photo  Technology companies argue that the restrictive measures the administration is taking to help protect them could end up penalizing American manufacturing, raising costs and making their companies less competitive globally. And industries most vulnerable to retaliation, like agriculture, are protesting about losing valuable export opportunities. While the Chinese did not target soybeans in their initial tariffs list, many in the soybean industry worry they will be penalized in a trade dispute given China\u2019s importance as a market for exports.  The 25 percent tariff on pork that China imposed on Monday is expected to be particularly harmful, including in regions that supported the president, like Iowa, North Carolina and Indiana. Last year, American farmers sent more than a billion dollars\u2019 worth of pork to China, their largest export market by value after Japan and Mexico.  \u201cBecause we\u2019re so blessed to have America feed the world, we\u2019re also the first industry to get slammed whenever there are trade difficulties between the U.S. and other countries,\u201d Denise Bode, the coordinator for the American Fruit and Vegetable Processors and Growers Coalition.

These new tariffs are a drag on their ability to make ends meet.\u201d  Since Mr. Trump announced the China measures on March 22, American officials, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and the United States trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, have been in talks with the Chinese about ways to resolve their differences. The sides have discussed concessions like reducing China\u2019s tariffs on American cars, opening up its market for financial services and purchasing more semiconductors or natural gas, people familiar with the talks said.  However, analysts and companies involved in China said that these measures appeared unlikely to adequately resolve American concerns about China\u2019s longstanding encroachment on American intellectual property.  Companies are waiting anxiously for the administration to release a list of Chinese products this week that will be subject to tariffs \u2014 most likely the kind of high-tech products that the administration has accused China of targeting. The retail industry, which lobbied the administration and Congress against an early plan to impose tariffs on Chinese-made apparel and footwear, is now cautiously optimistic that its products will be exempt.  Restrictions on Chinese investment are expected to follow in the coming weeks. Administration officials have said those rules will aim to restore reciprocity with the Chinese, though it is not clear if the United States will go so far as to bar Chinese companies from investing in the same industries that China restricts. The White House is also considering the use of an emergency economy powers act that could allow it to restrict Chinese investments.

Last month, the committee stalled a hostile takeover of Qualcomm, a California-based chip maker, by a Singapore company, largely over concerns about ceding semiconductor prowess to China.  G.E. and IBM, which operate through joint ventures and other partnerships in China and around the world, have both lobbied against the expansion of Cfius over concerns that restrictions on joint ventures with foreign companies that include the transfer of valuable skills or technology could weaken the position of American companies abroad.  Financial firms, including Goldman Sachs and the Carlyle Group, have also expressed concern about investment restrictions, saying they could provide a drag on the United States economy.  White House advisers, in turn, have complained that previous approaches to dealing with China have not worked, and that companies are overreacting to legitimate trade measures.

The simple grading system used by restaurant regulators can and should be a model to inform the public about the digital security of businesses that store sensitive consumer data. A letter grade is a crude measure to assess a complex issue like cybersecurity to be sure, but what the metric lacks in nuance it makes up for with brute force.  Current measures to assess cyber-preparedness are either not compulsory or too complex. The federal government\u2019s National Institute of Standards and Technology framework is widely respected, but it\u2019s voluntary, underused and not easily digestible for the average consumer. Only seven Fortune 500 companies mentioned it in their annual filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission last year, and only one said it had adopted it.  MSCI \u2014 an index provider and independent research firm for institutional investors \u2014 ranks companies on cybersecurity. More than a year before Equifax\u2019s breach was revealed, MSCI scored Equifax a 0 out of 10 on privacy and data security. As prescient as it was, consumers would have had difficulty absorbing such a rating, which is just one of several components that MSCI uses to arrive at an environmental, social and governance, or E.S.G., rating of overall corporate citizenship.  A new grading system should start with the basics: Are companies on top of data security, and if hacked, do they know how to reduce the impact?  Each year, the Ponemon Institute, an independent research group, and IBM look at the cost of the average data security breach, as well as the average cost of each piece of data compromised. In 2017, the average cost of a data breach in the United States was $7.35 million, or $141 per record compromised. But if a company has an incident response team, uses encryption, trains its employees, has a business continuity program and monitors cyber-threat intelligence, that reduces the cost of the average data breach by nearly 47 percent. Using these five factors \u2014 weighed for their impact of cost reduction \u2014 is a simple starting point.  There are plenty of details to be worked out about a cybersecurity grading system. But the one nonnegotiable aspect would be that, once assigned, letter grades must be made highly accessible to the public. Companies should be required to display their grades prominently at their physical locations, on their websites, on certain documents (mortgage applications, for example) and on credit card readers.

Among the notable recent reviews were:  MONEYGRAM \u2014 ANT FINANCIAL Ant Financial, a Chinese electronic payments company, wanted to purchase MoneyGram, a money transfer company based in Dallas, for $1.2 billion. But the deal collapsed in January after both sides said Cfius refused to approve it. The collapse came despite a charm offensive by Jack Ma, the Chinese tycoon who controls Ant Financial, who had visited President-elect Donald Trump at Trump Tower and pledged to create one million American jobs. But he could not overcome the Trump administration\u2019s concerns about Chinese acquisition of American know-how. CANYON BRIDGE CAPITAL \u2014 LATTICE Canyon Bridge Capital, a private equity firm, wanted to acquire Lattice, a chip maker based in Portland, Ore. Canyon Bridge received investment from a group that included China Venture Capital Fund Corporation, which is owned by Chinese government-backed organizations. Lattice said Cfius objected to the deal, and the company tried to appeal to the president, offering to resolve national security concerns. But Mr. Trump formally blocked the deal in September 2017, prompting China\u2019s commerce ministry to issue a statement saying countries should not push protectionism through security reviews. GO SCALE \u2014 PHILIPS In 2015, the Dutch electronics giant Philips had an agreement to sell a controlling stake in its automotive and LED business for as much as $2.9 billion to GO Scale, an investment fund sponsored by GSR Ventures of China and Oak Investment Partners. Philips canceled the deal after it could not resolve Cfius\u2019s concerns, and in December 2016 announced it would sell the unit to Apollo Global Management for $1.5 billion, almost half the amount of the earlier deal.  The Broadcom-Qualcomm deal does not involve China-based companies. But there has been concern that the acquisition could undermine the ability of the United States to compete with China in the race for telecommunications supremacy. Members of Cfius pointed to Broadcom\u2019s statements that it would take a \u201c\u2018private equity\u2019-style\u201d approach if it acquired Qualcomm, suggesting to the committee that Broadcom could reduce long-term investment on research and development in favor of focusing on short-term profits.  While the United States has remained a standard-bearer in mobile technology, the committee noted, \u201cChina would likely compete robustly to fill any void left by Qualcomm as a result of this hostile takeover.\u201d  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Lawmakers want to expand Cfius\u2019s jurisdiction  A bipartisan group in Congress has proposed legislation that would greatly expand the number of deals reviewed by Cfius. In November, Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, and Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, introduced a bill that could add thousands of companies with foreign ties to the list of those reviewed each year by Cfius and provide more funding to deal with that increase. A similar House bill was also introduced by Representative Robert Pittenger, Republican of North Carolina. The measure would expand Cfius\u2019s jurisdiction to include joint ventures, sales of minority stakes and real estate deals for property near military bases and other sensitive facilities.  \u201cBy exploiting gaps in the existing Cfius review process,\u201d said Mr. Cornyn, \u201cpotential adversaries, such as China, have been effectively degrading our country\u2019s military technological edge by acquiring, and otherwise investing in U.S. companies.\u201d  The proposal has drawn objections from some businesses. IBM said the changes would limit \u201cthe ability of American firms to do business abroad while empowering foreign competitors to capture global markets.\u201d", "stock": "IBM", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-05", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/business/what-is-cfius.html"}, {"article": "As a relatively new, and potentially less well-known architecture, serverless might require some defining. Indeed, three years ago, this whole area of technology did not exist.  Serverless means, from a developer\u2019s point of view, that there is no need to setup or manage server infrastructure running your applications.  This doesn\u2019t mean that servers aren\u2019t involved of course \u2013 they are, but with serverless computing developers are shielded from various server management decisions and capacity planning decisions.  Without having to factor servers into their task load or having the burden of managing and maintaining an infrastructure, developers can focus on what they do best.  What\u2019s more - in the past, they have had to learn how to configure many different services and frameworks including apache, nginx, postfix or php \u2013 just to a name a few.  Now, serverless has liberated developers by allowing them to focus on coding in the languages they best understand. The net effect is that developers have more time to focus on innovation, instead of managing the servers that run their code.  Speed, ease & cost efficiency  So, how is this new tech paradigm being applied? Generally speaking, due to the fact that serverless is relatively new, it lends itself to modern cloud native or microservice applications as opposed to legacy apps. Serverless computing is most suited to low-performance computing workloads due to the limits on resource imposed by cloud providers.  A particularly compelling use case for serverless is for building APIs due to increased speed. APIs are the software intermediaries that allow two applications to talk to each other. With serverless, developers can build APIs without having to manage any back-end infrastructure. If you\u2019re a front end java script developer for example, now you can build an API much quicker as you don\u2019t have to focus on lower level infrastructure operations and understand multiple coding languages.  In addition to developing APIs more quickly and easily, the use cases for serverless computing extends to traffic flow. APIs might get busy every day, but the peaks can be hard to predict. Let\u2019s take the example of a ticketing company \u2013 they will need to cope with huge spikes in traffic when a new show is announced. They will not necessarily need this level of server capacity at all times, but will still need to be prepared for it. With serverless, greater cost efficiency can be achieved as you only pay when requests are coming in and when your code is running.  For start-ups & for large scale enterprises  With lower upfront costs, serverless is great for start-ups \u2013 because they only really start paying when they begin to get traffic. Beyond start-ups, enterprises of any size that are looking to develop APIs will find that the benefits are clear \u2013 not only is serverless better value for money, it is quick, easy to use, and doesn\u2019t involve taking on a huge amount of risk.  Software developers SiteSpirit are a good example of how serverless architecture can help solve a business challenge by optimising processes. SiteSpirit helps clients create picture-perfect marketing material with a serverless media-library-as-a-service. In highly visual industries such as travel and real estate, marketers need quick and easy access to the right images to design compelling campaigns. With this cloud based service, the pain of storing, tagging, retrieving and manipulating thousands of images is removed \u2014and is built on a serverless architecture to keep costs low.  Open-source platforms open up innovation  However, concerns remain around proprietary lock-in as code written and deployed in the cloud becomes inextricably linked with the cloud provider at that point in time. This means that applications become optimised for a specific cloud environment, and moving cloud provider could sacrifice performance and responsiveness of an application. This is why many developers are now looking to open source solutions.  Deploying this kind of higher order tool, as opposed to running numerous functions that run in parallel will be crucial to optimising time spent on actual coding and building game-changing technology in the cloud.  Serverless: Serving the developer community  As serverless architectures are improved and the parameters are broadened, they are likely to become increasingly popular with developers looking to save time, reduce costs and focus on what they do best.  Within a couple of years, serverless is likely to become a default mode for the development of cloud-based technologies, liberating developers from back-end infrastructure maintenance and opening up programming to the many not the few.  In this way, serverless has the potential to provide a whole new way of working for developers; one in which innovation is at the fore.  James Thomas is a developer advocate for IBM Cloud.

The tiny computer bristles with several hundred thousand transistors and measures approximately 1mm squared, and has the computing power of an x86 chip from back in 1990, as Mashable reports (the above image from IBM shows two of the compact computers nestling in the top-left of the board).  It\u2019ll cost less than 10 cents to produce these grain-sized computers but, obviously enough, they aren\u2019t something you\u2019ll be running Microsoft Word on. The tiny devices are part of IBM\u2019s vision for future technology \u2013 they will be \u2018cryptographic anchors\u2019 embedded in everyday objects, used to ensure the object\u2019s authenticity in combination with blockchain tech.  In other words, this is an anti-fraud measure. At any point in the supply chain, counterfeit goods can potentially be introduced, but if the real devices have these tiny chips in them, they can be physically verified as the genuine article.  Joining the dots  They could be applied to expensive gadgets so you can be sure you\u2019re buying the real thing and not a knock-off, or these tiny computers could even be embedded in things like malaria pills as (edible) ink dots, again to ensure that patients are getting the genuine drug and not a fake.

Of those 143 million people, 209,000 had their credit card information made public as well.  The company in question was Equifax, a consumer credit reporting agency that\u2019s now synonymous with vulnerability. When we hear about attacks like this we\u2019re usually quick to blame the hackers, but in almost every case there were security measures that could have be taken to prevent the attacks, and which other businesses should be following to ensure they don't become the next victim.  For one, did you know you can have your firm audited for its cyber security? While this may seem like a no-brainer many companies fail to comply with contemporary protection standards. But because it\u2019s an admittedly nerve-wracking endeavor, we\u2019ve arranged our own do-it-yourself cyber security audit that you can perform for yourself by following a few easy steps.  Outdated software is a common culprit when it comes to failed cyber security audits. Whether your business is small or large, it\u2019s crucial that everyone is logged into the same network and using the same, most recent builds of whatever operating system you\u2019ve opted for. You may think you don\u2019t have to worry about your Linux-based servers, but if they\u2019re not up to date with the latest security measures you could be vulnerable.  For this reason you\u2019re going to want to use an enterprise network rather than deploying software manually on a per-computer basis. Doing so allows you or a specially trained team to implement and manage the company shield, instead of leaving everyone to fend for themselves.  No matter how skilled your employees, you can\u2019t trust everyone to constantly remain on top of security-related tasks in a timely manner. Installing a major software patch even a day or two late can open up your company to some particularly devastating threats \u2013 and the last thing you want your company known for is an outage.  2. Review your cyber security battalion  Take a look at who is in charge of your company\u2019s security push today. Is it an individual or a team of experts who know their trade better than they know you? It\u2019s critical that you assign clear-cut responsibility to someone who is as familiar with the ropes as they are with the back of their hands.  Once you\u2019ve assigned some sort of cybersecurity responsibility at your company, ensure that you communicate regularly with this person or group of people. And we'd go a step further, by ensuring that the people you\u2019ve put in charge are communicating clearly with other employees about the steps they're taking to safeguard your business.  When everyone working at your company is aware of cybersecurity procedures it's far less likely that unwelcome visitors will abuse your systems. Many authorities on the subject also recommend that you arrange for your employees to receive training on security posture, and you\u2019ll want to thoroughly document attendance at these events.  3. Assess currently instated measures  Here\u2019s where you\u2019ll want to inspect the hardware and software your company is using at the present. This goes hand-in-hand to some extent with step 1, and you\u2019ll want to make sure that your servers, databases as well as other hardware and software, are all connected to a secure network. Double-check that the programs your employees are using for work haven\u2019t been compromised with vulnerabilities.  The same principle applies to everything that comes in, or goes out, of your offices. That means laptops, tablets and mobile phones should be assessed, or else you\u2019ll be leaving the company at risk of malware and a multitude of other threats.  A lot of companies tend to ignore smartphones and other mobile devices when considering a cybersecurity plan of action. Nevertheless, these pose a threat that\u2019s equal to or sometimes greater than that from desktop workstation computers and servers. Bear that in mind as you reflect on the safety of all tools operated by corporate personnel.  4. Forestall any and all risks  Given that, according to the IBM Cyber Security Intelligence Index, human error is responsible for 95% of all security incidents that take place, ensure that such errors can\u2019t compromise you or your business. Threats such as phishing scams, ransomware and identity theft are increasingly ubiquitous in the information age, but there's lots you can do to guard against them.  By taking control of your network \u2013 or working with someone you trust to do it for you \u2013 you can keep security concerns down to a minimum. Of course, this means paying close attention to which sites and services your employees can access, and which of those are prone to malicious behavior.  Likewise, do your research. If one person in the IT department is the only one that understands your company\u2019s defenses, communicate with them and do your best to understand the ins and outs of the operation. Most importantly, prepare yourself to be informed and present in the unfortunate event that your company ends up in a bind, which leads us to our final point.  5. Plan ahead  Last, but certainly not least, you don\u2019t want to wait until you\u2019re under fire before you make a conscious decision to start getting proactive about cyber security \u2013 and you need to be prepared if an attack does happen, and have a post-breach recovery protocol up your sleeve.  Better yet, the plan ought to span multiple departments, rather than leaving IT in charge of the whole recovery process. The procedure for addressing such an episode must be put in writing, constantly updated to adhere to new developments in the cybersecurity field, and tested regularly to make sure it won\u2019t fail you in a real-world scenario.  With all of these steps in mind, your business can pass a proper cybersecurity audit with flying colors. That said, you will have to take steps above and beyond those outlined here to maximise protection against breaches in the foreseeable future.

It\u2019s been an interesting year for the company, with its server arm looking to grow into the market again, along with a host of new and updated consumer products.  EMEA President Francois Bornibus has witnessed Lenovo\u2019s growth in the region, but says that it\u2019s far from done. We caught up with him to talk about the Lenovo\u2019s strategy with AR and VR, and how the company is poised to harness 5G for a seamless VR experience from any location.  It\u2019s coming up to a year now with your role as EMEA President, from your previous role as EMEA COO. How has this changed your dynamic within Lenovo?  To be honest, there hasn\u2019t been much change at all! I\u2019ve been engaged with core parts of the business for so many years now, so there wasn\u2019t too much of a change with what I was doing. What\u2019s interesting to note is that when I joined the company seven years ago, Lenovo was selling notebooks to the larger accounts, because that was our history. The IBM and ThinkPad brands were sold to the enterprise market, and at that time we had about 8% EMEA market share.  Now the company is moving to 21.5% EMEA market share, covering all markets segments across a range of products \u2013 servers, AR/VR, detachables, laptops, PCs, and so much more. It\u2019s been a fantastic change for the company, and it\u2019s exciting to see what\u2019s in store for the future.  One of the things you\u2019ve been focusing on is the 2-in-1 market segment \u2013 do you still see a lot more growth for this?  The convertible concept we created four years ago is still a growing part of the business, and so is the market. For detachables the market isn\u2019t growing too much, but it\u2019s an important size of the market to keep an eye on and invest in. Our new Lenovo Mix 630 pushes an always-on, always-connected device, which is something the market has been looking for.  How have the Moto Mods been faring in the market since their launch?  Around one third of our customers are purchasing Moto Mods, which is a good sign. The initial offering of Moto Mods has now expanded to a larger variety as well \u2013 we have an Alexa-powered speaker, a Mod to measure blood pressure, and still many others on the market.  The health mod was especially successful, as we had a medical company approach us about it because they wanted to deploy this to customers so they could obtain a daily surveillance of important vital signs without having to send over a doctor every day. There are still plenty of other opportunities available, and the Moto Mods help to expand on the smartphone experience for consumers.  VR and AR was a huge focus this year - how is Lenovo able to differentiate its offerings from everything else that\u2019s coming to market?  It\u2019s all about the experience. Some products are similar, with content from different providers like Microsoft or Google. That\u2019s why for us it\u2019s all about making sure our customers have a unique experience with our products. The Star Wars Jedi Challenges for example, is a great partnership with Disney, and we\u2019re going to continue expanding on the kind of games that will be available.  VR and AR is also important for business applications as well, for example a travel agent that wants to show customers various travel packages and destinations. It has to be easy to use and immersive, but there\u2019s still a lot of work to do in order to make the experience as hassle-free and as enjoyable as possible. The headsets themselves are still quite big, so we need to continue to work on the technology to make it smaller and still usable.  Star Wars Jedi Challenges has been in the market for a few months now \u2013 what has feedback been like?  The feedback so far is that the product is very interesting, but there are two things we have to continue to work on. First is the content \u2013 the game is really fun and interesting, but we also have to try and look at other games or experiences we can offer customers.  Secondly we want to try and expand the number of supported phones, simply because the system requirements dictate that only high-end smartphones will work for the best experience. It\u2019s our first trial at making such a device, so we will keep listening and working on improvements and new content.  What are some scenarios you see the Mirage headset fitting into?  The Mirage headset and camera is all about sharing experiences, and that\u2019s where this device shines. It\u2019s going to be interesting to see how it does, but we have to be careful that the network capability is also there to support these new technologies. So wherever you are streaming from with your camera, the cellular network is powerful enough to provide a smooth experience for users.  Operators are looking at 5G technologies keenly, because AR/VR can use a lot of bandwidth which people will have to pay for. So in a way it\u2019s a great thing for operators to be looking at. It works in certain environments, but when you\u2019re talking about streaming from very remote places, you need to make sure you can get good connectivity for the best experience.  Is the Lenovo Smart Display your answer to a more interactive personal assistant?  Absolutely. People want to see what they\u2019re buying, not just hear a description being read out. So these kind of products will have a very interesting future. It might also lead to future new devices for a totally new ecosystem, who knows.

You either have to wait for a document to arrive through the letterbox or print it out from an email, physical sign the paper and either scan it and email it back or post it. In an era of constant connectivity and digital transformation, doesn\u2019t this seem archaic?  Esignature (or Esign) software can make your personal and office life that much easier. It eliminates a tedious, time consuming task into something that can be done with a few clicks. You can sign multiple documents at the same time and get paperwork to the right people as soon as they need it.  If you've already ditched physical snail mail, faxes and paperwork filing, then you'll wonder why you haven't looked into e-signatures before...  The only downside is that your fancy signature will soon be redundant.  1. Adobe Sign  We're going straight in with the big boy - Adobe Sign is the e-signature solution offered by one of the most famous names in the software business.  Adobe's service offers plenty of features and functionality. It's available via both the web and mobile app, so you can easily use your e-signature when away from the office. It offers an authentication service to ensure that those applied to important documents clear basic legal compliance, and of course you can personalize your e-signature, too.  Recent enhancements include compliance for life science and pharmaceutical firms and integration with SAP SuccessFactors.  For use between two to nine users, you'll need to sign up for Adobe Sign Team, costing $24.99 (\u00a326.10, around AU$32) per person per month. To see whether it's worth the cash, you can try a free 14-day trial first.  2. DocuSign  Claiming to have more than 200 million users worldwide, there's no denying the popularity of DocuSign. The company is a dedicated e-signature solution provider, offering straightforward to use software to quickly and easy get your documents signed.  It's easy to get going with DocuSign thanks to its number of integrations with the likes of Google, Windows, Apple and SalesForce, as well as a number of apps for mobile devices. It puts a lot of emphasis on security, using strong encryption technologies and employing industry best practices for protecting the data it handles.  Indeed, as of March 2018, DocuSign has had its application for Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs) approved. This is the EU's highest level of certification for data transfers outside the bloc.  Its pricing isn't dissimilar to Adobe's. Get DocuSign Standard for multiple users and you'll have to pay $25 (\u00a320, around AU$32) per user per month. You can try docusign for free first with a 30-day trial.  3. Secured Signing  Secured Signing is a more cost effective software than the above two e-signature solutions. It's cloud-based, meaning that it's easy to access and use your electronic signature from desktop, laptop or mobile device.  We're impressed by the sheer amount of extra services it offers. For example, there's a video confirmation feature where you can identify the signer and prevent any document tampering (if that's a concern). You can invite others to sign. And there's even options for document negotiation - a one-stop service to get to the all important dotted line as soon as possible.  A major update released in January offers automatic recognition of form fields in PDF files, multiple numbers of signature fields for the same witness and multi-page signing.  We also like that it's easier to customise your package and get better value as you add more users. The Team Edition starts at around $20/\u00a320 a month, but gets relatively cheaper for more people. Head over to Secured Signing for your tailored quote.  4. eSignLive  If you want endorsements from some familiar names, eSignLive has got some pretty big companies using its e-signature software. How do IBM, BMW and the US Army sound for starters?  That said, eSignLive still says that it's equally useful for small and large businesses alike, with an optimized, easy-to-use workflow across devices and personnel. It can be deployed on a public or private cloud, within your computing infrastructure only or a combination of the three. But as well as flexibility, the software also has the protection of your company's security at its heart.  You can get eSignLive for $20 (around \u00a315, AU$25) per user per month, or give have a go for free with a 30-day trial.  5. SignEasy  Although SignEasy can obviously be used from your office or home computer, it seems to have channeled a lot of effort into making it mobile ready. It's cloud-based - so can be accessed on the go - and the mobile experience for phones and tablets is very smartly laid out.  Otherwise, it has many of the same features as the above e-signature services, but there's a real focus on simplicity (as the name suggests). You can annotate signature boxes so that it's crystal clear who needs to sign and how. And if you find that the same kind of documents need to be electronically signed over and over again, then it's easy to set up templates for reuse.  SignEasy recently passed five million downloads and has agreed a partnership with WeWork to bring e-Signatures to its community.  Try before you buy with a 14-day trial. If you're a small business, then signing up to SignEasy is on the more affordable side - $15 (around \u00a312, AU$19) per month. But that's only for one sender. It's more like $80 (around \u00a362, AU$101) per month for the full premium plan of up to five users.  6. KeepSolid Sign  KeepSolid Sign is the offering from security and encryption specialists KeepSolid. It promises rapid, legally-binding signatures on any device, as well as offline access to signed contracts.  In terms of usability, there are annotation and collaboration tools alongside document tracking so its easy to make changes and work together on projects or legal processes. You can get documents from virtually any major cloud or email repository, including Google Drive, Dropbox, Box and iCloud. Simply import the document into KeepSolid Sign and add your signature.  The key selling point of KeepSolid is its security credentials as it fits into the company\u2019s wider portfolio of safety and privacy tools and the app is protected by AES-256 encryption.  There\u2019s a 14-day free trial, after which plans start at $9.99 a month for a personal subscription. A small team subscription covering five years is $39.99 a year and for ten users its $71.99. There are enterprise subscriptions on offer too.  How to choose an e-signature solution  Electronic signatures, often referred to as E-signatures, are a digital version of someone\u2019s \u201canalog\u201d or handwritten signature (not to be confused with digital signatures).  E-signature solutions were born out of the need to to accelerate the transition to the paperless office. There are now plenty of them in the market since the technology first came to market more than 20 years ago.  They have grown in popularity over the past few years as businesses of all sizes embrace the SaaS (software-as-a-service) paradigm which removes many of the inconveniences associated with some more traditional e-signature solutions.  Below are five important things to look for when you choose an e-signature solution.  1. Device agnostic  By that we mean that the process of signing should be seamless regardless of the device being used. Mac, PC, tablet or mobile handset. That applies to the document management part as well as in-person signing which allows third parties to sign to sign directly on your device and get the completed document delivered securely via email. Being able to do it anywhere and at anytime provides with a massive boost in efficiency, especially as it doesn\u2019t require any application (or app), just your standard browser and internet connectivity.  2. Connect to popular business applications and services  Tight integration with existing popular online applications such as Google Docs, Zoho, Dropbox, Salesforce, OneDrive or Evernote is critical to maintain the viability of your existing document workflow. That integration should be as seamless and as quick as possible so that users can hit the ground running with minimal downtime. Look out for APIs as well as they will allow you to push the integration even further, allowing developers to tailor the provision of e-signature for specific use cases.  3. Grow with the company  APIs usually give you the flexibility of scaling as far as you want. But just make sure that your e-signature provider can support your business demands with an adequate number of API requests, should you go that route with a number of tiers that correspond to your business needs. Having a tiered approach means that businesses can grow (or shrink) their e-signature service requirements without negatively impacting their bottom line.  4. Meet security, regulatory and authentication requirements  An electronic signature means nothing if you can\u2019t guarantee the authenticity of the sender, the recipient and the actual document. Having a robust audit trail feature helps as it provides with a shared and readily available list of who has done what and when. Make sure your e-signature provider complies at least with ESIGN (the U.S. Electronic Signature in Global and National Commerce Act of 2000), UETA ( Uniform Electronic Transactions Act) and eIDAS (European Union Directive 910/2014). And do make sure that your solution protects you not only from forgery but also from repudiation.  5. Excellent management capabilities  Being able to manage multiple list of signees and users of the e-signature solution within the company is important to maintain the integrity of the system. Granular control of team members, for example, should be high on your list as it allows various teams (e.g. sales, HR or legal) to have access to different documents and signees while sharing the same platform. The same goes for templates; having these ready allows for faster turnaround, which translates into more efficient processes.  Eversign is a newcomer in the world of e-signature but its impressive list of features will appeal both to small companies and big enterprises.", "stock": "IBM", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-16", "source": "techradar", "url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/best-e-signature-apps-software-solutions"}, {"article": "Cloud computing has been developing rapidly since the term was coined in 2006. It\u2019s played an integral role in the transformation of many businesses over the last decade, particularly valued for the reliability, scalability and versatility that cloud technology brings compared to traditional dedicated servers. And this race to the cloud will only gather pace as technology matures.  Having the ability to understand, evaluate and implement cloud computing is crucial for today\u2019s business leaders, regardless of whether they operate in IT or not. As business needs evolve, so too does cloud infrastructure.  There has been a strong growth within the private and hybrid cloud computing market, and in the next twelve months we can only expect that the technology will gain further importance and adoption.  Research company IDC\u2019s findings back this prediction up, by pointing out that a year ago traditional data centres accounted for 62 per cent of IT infrastructure spending, while public cloud captured 23 per cent and private cloud, 15 per cent.  Illustrating a rapid shift, IDG predicts that by 2020 data centres will represent 50 per cent of the market, with public cloud forming just under a third of the market and private cloud making up 20 per cent. In simple terms, data centres\u2019 importance is diminishing, while public and private cloud technology\u2019s value and usability is growing and gaining traction.  As the current cloud landscape is changing, what can we expect from this market in 2018?  Hybrid cloud computing will gain traction  Going back to basics, a hybrid cloud enables businesses to use a combination of different cloud model types. For example: a public cloud with a private cloud, or one private cloud with another one, or one public cloud with a second public cloud. Some businesses see hybrid cloud use as a way to deal with IT demand peaks, while others view it as a central management experience.  Many companies tend to start working with hybrid clouds to complement their present investments. For instance, as most businesses usually use a sliding scale for what aspects of their operations are most crucial, some would place the less valuable or security-demanding areas in the public cloud. Meanwhile, other aspects that need more control and safety would be directed to the private cloud within that hybrid cloud space. This way, they can control and oversee their operations and systems management. With the increasing adoption of hybrid cloud computing, we will see the market grow steadily.  While last year was important for experimenting and learning about the technology, cloud vendors will continue to crystallise their strategies throughout this year. One vivid example is Microsoft\u2019s launch of private cloud platform Azure Stack, the purpose of which is to mirror the Azure public cloud. Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services partnered with platform virtualisation giant VMware, to offer a new hybrid cloud extension. Further, Oracle and IBM now have their own hybrid cloud offerings. These are only a few examples of how, as major cloud vendors\u2019 strategies are gelling, they will gain momentum as their clients continue to seek the best ways to manage their public and private clouds.  Another important development will be the optimisation of connections to the cloud. Very few companies use only one cloud model \u2013 many have both public and private clouds. This means that if a business uses a hybrid cloud, it can certainly benefit from access to an optimised network connection to that cloud. This need has led to a growth in the interconnection providers market, known as multi-clouds, and as hybrid cloud computing becomes popular, businesses will need to prioritise creating, maintaining and optimising such connections.  The emergence of multi-clouds  With the increased exploration of hybrid cloud, people will also start turning their heads to emerging options such as multi-clouds, which are naturally evolving from hybrid cloud use. Multi-clouds enable the use of multiple cloud computing services in a single infrastructure. For example, a company can use separate cloud providers for its infrastructure and software services, or it can use a number of infrastructure providers for a variety of workloads. This is when multi-cloud architecture comes into play, as it enables businesses to increase their cloud operations\u2019 availability. So, if one of the cloud vendors in the architecture is experiencing a problem, the business can switch workloads from it to a different vendor\u2019s infrastructure.  There are a number of reasons why multi-clouds will become increasingly powerful and valued. They enable the complete integration of all the prevalent public clouds like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform. They also optimise multi-cloud management into one sole activity, by allowing a wide-ranging cloud network to exist in a single platform. Furthermore, multi-clouds enable the automation of IT networking, which makes it easy to connect to and switch between public and private clouds. More importantly, centralised cloud networking management enables a business to access, control, analyse and trace faults in all its cloud resources in one unifying place. This can bring business optimisation and increased efficiency \u2013 and what business doesn\u2019t want that?  All of this means that the emergence, and eventually adoption, of multi-cloud computing focuses on connectivity and therefore brings more relevance to networking and to the easier ways of managing networks. Having looked at the emerging cloud options and the changing landscape, we also need to consider the reasons why more enterprises turn to cloud providers.  The hyperscale of cloud providers  Amazon, Microsoft and Google\u2019s cloud infrastructure is on such a large scale, that we talk about them as a hyperscale cloud, as opposed to a mere cloud. While they offer a hosting service that is safe, scalable and global, they are also constantly innovating and collaborating, ensuring that they\u2019re experiencing immense growth because of it.  Hyperscale providers are in a features arms race, the latest battleground being the creation of machine learning and artificial intelligence platforms, steadily revolutionising these spaces. Over the next twelve months we can be certain to observe a further consolidation of their services, with hyperscale providers building platforms that are easy to consume and reduce operational costs. This will naturally lead to decreasing cloud expenditure as these become more mature, more accessible and easier to work with, driving a further decline in traditional computing.  Companies\u2019 digital transformations have come a long way, but as cloud platforms continue to innovate and as machine learning and artificial intelligence become increasingly efficient, businesses need to carefully evaluate what is right for them long term. This is not a decision that can just be taken by the IT team any more.  Consequently, many organisations, wondering where to start, turn to managed service providers accredited by hyperscale cloud providers, as they can design and deliver bespoke cloud computing solutions that are tailored to an organisation\u2019s specific needs. Using the help of a trusted expert and solution-led infrastructure company is often the best way to solve a business challenge with technology, and to be safely guided through the journey to the cloud.

While this works well for many websites, having fixed resources can be a problem for larger projects. There's generally no way to temporarily allocate extra RAM or bandwidth if you experience an increase in traffic, and even a simple plan upgrade might require your website to go offline for a while.  Cloud hosting plans look much like virtual private server (VPS) products, where you'll initially pay for a set amount of web space, RAM, CPU time and bandwidth. But these resources are spread across multiple devices instead of just one, and changing your plan later \u2013 adding another gig of RAM, for instance \u2013 is generally as easy as dragging a slider, with the extra power coming online within moments.  This flexibility is great for delivering extra power when you need it most, and starting prices can be similar to regular VPS hosting (from \u00a310 or $14 a month). Costs will rise as you add resources, but typically you'll only pay for the time in which you use these resources.  DigitalOcean's monster 192GB RAM, 32 vCPU and 3,840GB SSD product costs $960 (\u00a3685) a month, for instance, but this pay-as-you-go approach allows you to try it out for $1.429 or \u00a31.02 an hour.  Cloud hosting still won't be for everyone, and small, simple websites are likely to be better off with regular packages. But the technology has a lot to offer anyone with larger or more ambitious projects, and many hosts run free trials which make it easy to explore their abilities for yourself.  Check out the best web hosting services for 2018  A great option for smaller operations  Simple to use  Solid range of plans  Temptingly priced with initial discounts  Cloud hosting isn't just for big business. HostGator's cloud platform spreads your website load across multiple virtual server instances for more reliable and scalable hosting, but it's as easy to use as standard shared hosting, and only costs a little more.  For example, the baseline Hatchling Cloud plan gets you support for one domain, unmetered bandwidth and storage, a share of up to two cores and 2GB RAM, and distributed Varnish caching to speed up the loading of static content. You can get started for as little as $4.95 (\u00a33.50) a month if you buy three years upfront, although the price leaps to $8.95 (\u00a36.40) on renewal.  If you need something more powerful, the top-of-the-range Business Cloud plan supports unlimited domains, gives you up to six cores and 6GB RAM, and includes private SSL and a dedicated IP. Another chunky introductory discount means you can pay as little as $9.95 (\u00a37.10) a month over three years, but after that you'll pay $17.95 (\u00a312.80) per month.  Benefits of the cloud plans include (up to) twice as fast load times, along with more site statistics, and because your site is mirrored across multiple devices, the ability to switch your site to another server in the event of a hardware failure.  But the key advantage of all cloud hosting schemes is scalability. If your site can't cope with demand, you can scale up to eight cores and 8GB RAM with a click. There's no waiting around for someone to process your order and no downtime while your web space is reallocated \u2013 you get the extra resources right away.  Offers a wide range of plans catering for all users  Powerful Flex plan  Extras like DDoS protection  Can try before you buy  1&1 Cloud Server Hosting is a powerful range of products which combine dedicated server resources with the performance, flexibility and scalability of the best cloud hosting technologies.  Seven standard root access (self-managed) configurations aim to cover everyone from the individual user (\u00a39.99 or $14 a month for a single CPU core, 1GB RAM and 50GB storage) to big businesses (16 cores, 48GB RAM and 500GB storage for a monster \u00a3349 or $488 a month).  All plans have decent specifications, giving you unlimited traffic and email accounts, a bundled SSL certificate, DDoS protection and a choice of US and European data centers.  A wide range of options includes Windows hosting, or managed hosting with your choice of stack: Apache + MySQL + PHP 7.2, Nginx + MariaDB + PHP 7.2, Joomla, Drupal, WordPress and more.  The highlight of the range is probably 1&1's Cloud Hosting Flex package. Not only does this allow for adjusting cores, RAM and storage on demand, and adding up to 99 servers to the same contract, but billing is by the minute and you're only charged for what you use.  Prices start at \u00a322.28 ($31.20) a month including the management fee. There's no long-term contract and the first 30 days is free, giving you the chance to try before you buy.  A neat compromise between power and ease-of-use  User-friendly yet powerful  Highly configurable  Free trial  At first glance, cloud hosting products seem to be divided into two clear groups: user-friendly but basic products from hosts like 1&1, and enterprise-level technology from Amazon, Microsoft, IBM and more, which is so complex that even experts might struggle to set it up.  Cloudways represents an interesting middle path. The company offers managed cloud hosting which is powered by your choice of the top providers \u2013 Amazon, Google, DigitalOcean, Kyup, Linode or Vultr are supported \u2013 and comes packed with features, yet is configured from a simple web console which is just as easy to use as the more basic competition.  It's an impressive platform. Cloudways' ThunderStack covers all your core performance needs: Nginx, Apache, Memcached, MySQL/MariaDB, Varnish Cache, PHP 7, PHP-FM and Redis. There's one-click cloning, backup and restore, integrated Git and team collaboration tools for developers, and no less than 25 data centers strategically placed around the world.  Despite all this high-end functionality, Cloudways products are generally simple to operate, and prices start at a beginner-friendly $10 (\u00a37.15) a month for one core, 1GB RAM, 25GB storage and 1TB of bandwidth. It's all supremely configurable, and a free trial allows you to check out the product, with no credit card details required.  A UK-based outfit which offers some unusual perks  Lots of flexibility  In-house platform using open source  Help to configure firewall, backups and more  Founded in 2002, Bytemark is a UK-based cloud hosting company which has designed its own public platform using open source software.  This in-house experience brings some unusual advantages. Bytemark has developed its own hosting environment to set up a server, email and more. It covers everything from installing and managing PHP, MySQL, Perl and Ruby on Rails to helping you configure your firewall, spam rules and backups.  Experienced users can manage their account with a command line client, or even automate common tasks by integrating with Bytemark's API.  Pricing seems fair. The baseline specification costs \u00a310 ($14) for one core, 1GB RAM, 25GB storage, 1TB bandwidth and one IPv4, plus \u2013 unusually \u2013 one IPv6 address. If you need more, everything is available via a simple flat rate: \u00a310 ($14) per 1GB RAM, \u00a32 ($2.80) per 10GB storage, \u00a320 ($28) per extra 1TB of traffic. Unusually, you can even get a Windows licence for only \u00a31 ($1.40) per GB of memory.  As ever with cloud hosting, there's plenty of flexibility. You can configure your servers with anything from 1 to 180GB RAM, 1 to 16 CPU cores, and 1 to 8 individual disks with either fast SSD or cheaper archive storage.  If you're interested, Bytemark's free trial gives you seven days or a \u00a350 ($70) spend (whichever comes first) to find out more.  Hosting for the more demanding user  Really well-featured  Highly flexible  Transparent pricing  While cloud hosting schemes always involve pooling resources from multiple devices, most do their best to keep you away from the low-level details. You may be able to scale your plan by adding CPU cores, RAM or storage, for instance, but the console will present this to you as a single system.  DigitalOcean's Droplets are based around similar resizable and customizable virtual machines, but that's just the start \u2013 the technology has much more to offer.  For starters, the system supports Droplets of different types. If the standard plans aren't enough \u2013 priced from $5 (\u00a33.55) a month for one core, 1GB RAM and 25GB storage \u2013 Optimized Droplets aim to ramp up your performance by using the best Broadwell and Skylake CPUs, and providing more RAM and storage space.  Individual Droplets have more features than you might expect, including performance monitoring and alerts, snapshots and automatic system-level backups.  There are various interesting ways to work with your Droplets as a group, including setting up a cloud firewall, and using a load balancer to distribute incoming traffic across your infrastructure.  DigitalOcean's transparent pricing is a highlight. You're billed hourly, with monthly caps, ensuring you only pay for the resources you use. Many of the features come for free \u2013 monitoring, cloud firewall \u2013 while others follow very simple pricing rules. Snapshots cost $0.05 per gigabyte per month, for instance, while backups are priced at 20% of the cost of the virtual machine \u2013 easy.  If all you want to do is host a scalable WordPress site, this will probably be overkill, but developers, sysadmins and other more demanding users will appreciate the power and flexibility DigitalOcean offers.

As in sport, so in consulting, except in one important regard. Consulting, unlike the Olympics, is about the winning, not the taking part. So which is the best consultancy in the UK, based on the views of peers and clients?  For the UK\u2019s Leading Management Consultants 2018, Statista, the research and data provider, sorted recommendations into three categories. Six stars were awarded to firms \u201cvery frequently recommended\u201d in a consulting service or sector, five for \u201cfrequently recommended\u201d and four for \u201crecommended\u201d. Let us call these the gold, silver and bronze \u201cmedals\u201d in each \u201cevent\u201d. Deloitte, KPMG and McKinsey top the table by total number of medals \u2014 they each won star ratings in 29 sectors and services, the maximum.  This version of the table tells a familiar story: there is a gap between the largest, universal consultancies and the rest. Recommendations were made in at least 21 of the categories for the Big Four accountancy firms (Deloitte, KPMG, PwC and EY), the Big Three traditional strategy consultancies (McKinsey, Boston Consulting Group and Bain) and Accenture.  But this is only one way of arranging a medals table. At the 2016 Rio Olympics, for instance, Team GB won fewer medals overall than China, but beat China in the ranking by number of gold medals.  If one cuts the consulting medal tally in a similar way, it reveals a different picture: Accenture comes top. Despite gaining no medal ratings in two categories, it achieved 18 six-star ratings overall, against KPMG\u2019s 17, Deloitte\u2019s 12 and McKinsey\u2019s 11. This table also elevates IBM to equal fifth with PwC, for its nine \u201cgolds\u201d.  There is more to this than meets the eye. The Management Consultancies Association \u2014 a trade body whose members include Deloitte, KPMG and PwC \u2014 pointed out in its recent analysis of UK industry data that in 2016, the largest firms grew by 4 per cent on average. Medium-sized firms did better, growing by 6 per cent, and specialists\u2019 growth exceeded 20 per cent.  A similar story is told by our ranking. On overall medal tally, there is a notable gap between Bain (which garnered 21 six-, five- or four-star ratings) and the next highest groups, IBM (14) and AT Kearney and PA Consulting (13 each).  But the alternative view shows it is possible for specialists to win gold in single events. For example, Atkins Global topped the podium in the construction and infrastructure sector. OC&C was among the gold medallists in consumer goods and retail, and BAE destroyed all-comers in defence. Hay Group, part of Korn Ferry, the executive search firm, since 2015, wins gold in its specialist area of people and performance.  These companies join Oliver Wyman, Baringa and Simon-Kucher in a cluster of seven consultancies that won the top ranking in one sector or service. In this analysis of the ranking, they jump above AT Kearney and PA, which achieved no six-star ratings.  Some distinct subsidiaries of the biggest companies are winning recommendations, often by specialising, for example QuantumBlack, McKinsey\u2019s data analytics arm.  If anything, the ranking may overstate the importance of the bigger groups, whose balance sheets buy a lot of name recognition.  What an at-a-glance analysis of the table does suggest is that trying to be all things to all clients is probably futile unless you are one of the largest consultancies. On the other hand, a strategy of smart specialisation could pay off. After all, if you are a small nation that is home to the world\u2019s best weightlifters, why try to beat the USA in the track and field events?

Want to quickly see who has the coolest looks on the red carpet? Want to gain AI-generated insights into the \"emotional tone\" of songs by this year's nominees? Watson's got you covered.  Behind the scenes, Watson's AI will be used to help streamline the academy's digital workflow. In the past, the Grammys relied on third-party photography services to aggregate and distribute images from the five-and-a-half-hour red carpet pre-show. This process is cumbersome and much too slow in a social-media-fueled era of instant gratification. But with thousands of photos taken at the red carpet each year, manually sorting, tagging and tweeting is pretty much a nonstarter. So Watson is stepping in to make the Recording Academy's life much easier.  \"At the end of the day, it really boils down -- especially on Grammy Sunday -- to making sure the fan experience is as deep and as engaging as it possibly can be,\" Evan Greene, the Recording Academy's chief marketing officer, told Engadget.  Greene added that the academy's partnership with IBM offers an opportunity to use Watson's ever-expanding platform of services to synthesize all the information coming out of the red carpet in a digestible way. It's just the latest example of IBM using Watson to enhance fan experiences for major live events. For instance, Watson's capabilities were used to generate tennis highlight videos at the US Open last year.  For Grammy night, IBM created a system that ingests red carpet images from Getty and analyzes them in real time to identify the people in the photos, the colors of the outfits being worn and the people's emotions. This information is then added to the metadata for each image as the Academy sends them out to the media and through its own social channels.  Watson will also cross-reference outfits worn this year with looks from red carpets past, giving fans a connection to some of their favorite moments in the show's history, said John Kent, the program manager for IBM Worldwide Sponsorship Marketing.  The company's Watson Tone Analyzer API will also analyze the lyrics of nominated tunes and albums and group them into five categories: joy, fear, disgust, anger and sadness. As with the red carpet looks, these will be compared to past music from this year's nominees, Kent added.  IBM and the academy launched a website where fans can check out these features over the course of Sunday's red carpet show. The goal is to make watching the Grammys feel more interactive for viewers, said Noah Syken, vice president for sports and partnerships at IBM. By digging into past awards looks and getting a better understanding of the musicality of nominated songs, fans can have a better understanding of this year's nominees and where they fall in the Grammys' storied pop culture history.  So what is the development process like for adapting Watson's capabilities to an event like this? For Kent, it involves an assessment of what Watson can and cannot do, and how it could be most useful to a client like the Recording Academy.  \"We do an overview of what Watson is and what Watson isn't. What are the challenges? What is the audience? The big challenge with the red carpet is 'how can we help the Recording Academy deal with the hundreds of thousands of photos taken on the red carpet?'\" Kent said. \"So in developing programs, we always make sure we are checking efficiency boxes and checking fan-experience boxes and making those happen.\"  It essentially boils down to \"getting the most value out of the data\" being gathered, Syken added.  Kent said that just as with serving up real-time highlights for US Open fans, Watson's visit to the Grammys red carpet offers a template for how this kind of data analysis could be used for less-splashy projects.  While this time Watson is being used to contextualize viral pop culture moments, Kent stressed that the supercomputer's suite of programs can be applied to any number of businesses. In the past, Watson's ability to aggregate and interpret large swaths of data has been used to create innovative recipes and even diagnose a rare form of leukemia.  \"It's important for Watson to help real businesses, and that's really what we are doing here,\" he said. \"The Grammys happen to be a great cultural experience, but it all goes back to 'how is Watson going to drive new value for partners and clients? How will they be able to harness insights from all these photos, for instance, to create all these new experiences? To create meaningful experiences?'\"  When Watson first won Jeopardy in 2011, the capabilities of artificial intelligence weren't obvious to much of the public. But after its time in the spotlight on a game show stage, suddenly what once felt like science fiction became accessible. Flash forward seven years and Syken said that partnerships like this one at the Grammys continue to underscore just how useful AI can be.

Transcripts of an interview the participants took part in were broken down into parts of speech and were scored on how coherent the sentences were. Then, the machine learning model determined, based on those speech patterns, who was at risk of developing psychosis and who wasn't. Of those participants, 19 developed a psychotic disorder within two years while 40 did not and the model was able to predict that with 83 percent accuracy. It was also able to differentiate speech patterns of patients who had recently developed psychosis from those of healthy patients with 72 percent accuracy. The program found that those at risk of psychosis used fewer possessive pronouns when speaking and constructed less coherent sentences.  While the work is still ongoing, it shows that AI could be an effective tool and could be particularly useful when mental health professionals are in short supply or aren't available. \"We believe this is a significant step towards the goal of developing a tool for mental health practitioners, caregivers and patients themselves with a tool that can expand and multiply the reach of neuropsychiatric assessment outside of the clinic,\" said study author Guillermo Cecchi in a blog post. In the video below he says that being able to predict risk of psychosis years in advance could help medical and mental health professionals better allocate their resources and provide better care to those at risk. Cecchi points out that one area where this may have an impact is with the homeless who likely don't have the resources to seek out medical help. \"Given that I feel we can do something, we should,\" he says.

In fact, IBM already released a Watson-powered voice assistant for cybersecurity early last year. You'll be able to access Watson Assistant via text or voice, depending on the device and how IBM's partner decides to incorporate it. So, you'll definitely be using voice if it's a smart speaker, but you might be able to text commands to a home device.  Speaking of commands, it wasn't just designed to follow them -- it was designed to learn from your actions and remember your preferences. If you allow the Watson-powered applications you use to access each other's data through IBM Cloud, which delivers and enables Assistant's capabilities, they can learn more about you and deliver life-like conversations with context.  In IBM's sample scenario, it said Watson Assistant can automatically check you into your hotel and make sure your rental car (so long as it has a Watson-powered console) is ready as soon as you walk out the airport. The car's console can suggest locations to visit en route to your hotel, as well. If the hotel uses a smart assistant powered by IBM's AI, then it can automatically tweak your room's temperature and lighting based on your preferences and even start playing music you like when you're almost there. The hotel room's (Watson-powered) wall dashboard can also display your schedule and emails before you even walk in using the electronic key automatically sent to your phone.  All those are made possible by allowing all Watson apps to access each other's data. Of course, they're just imaginary scenarios that can only become reality if Watson Assistant experiences widespread adoption. And even if at least a couple of those scenarios become a possibility, you'll have to be willing to share data between apps.

Neuromorphic computing will be able to do lot more than recognize handwritten samples, though.

I mean, obviously, it's best the companies can regulate themselves. Let's see what ideas they come up with, but possibly some government regulation may be needed as well.\"  Branson would obviously know. As Virgin Group has evolved over more than four decades, so has the sheer amount of customer data it manages and keeps private. Since co-founding Virgin Group in 1970, the British multinational corporation now controls over 400 companies around the world covering a range of industries, from health care (Virgin Care), hotels (Virgin Hotels) to space travel with Virgin Galactic.  Branson's comments come on the heels of controversial remarks made by Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook over the last week over revelations earlier this month that Cambridge Analytica, a voter-profiling company, had abused Facebook's terms of service and harvested the data of some 50 million Facebook users as part of a targeted advertising campaign to help elect Donald Trump. Cook stated in no uncertain terms that the situation had become \"so dire\" and \"so large\" that \"well-crafted regulation\" was likely necessary.  \"We could make a ton of money if we monetized our customers, if our customers were our product,\" Cook said in an interview with Recode and MSNBC that will air on April 6. \"We've elected not to do that ... We're not going to traffic in your personal life. Privacy to us is a human right, a civil liberty.\"  Likewise, Ginni Rometty, CEO of IBM (IBM), has also come out swinging, stating at a Beijing event earlier this week that companies dealing with customer data have to be transparent in how they use \u2014 and allow third-parties to use \u2014 that data so \"they should never be surprised.\"  \"(We have to let) people opt in and opt out and be clear that ownership of the data does belong to the creator,\" Rometty added.  \u2014  More from JP", "stock": "IBM", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-29", "source": "engadget", "url": "https://www.engadget.com/2018/03/29/richard-branson-user-data-government-regulation-facebook/"}, {"article": "According to IBM Security's new \"Future of Identity Study,\" users of both mobile and desktop are wide awake to what's happening with each new high profile breach, and it's made them change their priorities. Strong security and privacy are now at the forefront of the average user's concerns, especially when it comes to banking, financial, online marketplaces, and their email accounts.  That's a sharp contrast to research from Gartner in 2008, which also surveyed 4,000 people and found that most consumers didn't want to change the way they did passwords or security, and were highly resistant to using password managers or adopting additional security measures around log-ins.  \"Despite widespread security concerns,\" Gartner concluded ten years ago, \"consumers continue to rely on service providers to protect their safety and persist in using unsafe password management practices, preferring to maintain the status quo rather than exploring new security methods.\"  IBM's 2018 report surveyed nearly 4,000 adults from around the world. Most respondents were in the US. Over half said they would never trade security for convenience. Like, never.  That sentiment increased with age. IBM's findings showed that 53 percent of 18-23 year olds were in the \"no trade-offs\" camp, whereas this sentiment increased in older people. At the end of the spectrum where the olds were, 84 percent of people 55 and older said that nope, they'd never ever sacrifice security for convenience.  Sadly it was only people who said this, and not corporations, who are sometimes people, but are always sacrificing our security for their convenience.  Additionally, IBM found that 74 percent of consumers said they'd prefer to use extra security like two-factor authentication, extra passwords, or any other additional step for added protection. If they could, they would. Interestingly, the study said that \"36 percent of those ages 18 - 20 say they use password managers to keep passwords and avoid having to memorize them, compared to only 26 percent of users in the general population.\"  It all comes down to trust. Between Yahoo's flaming 3 billion user security disaster, Equifax's negligent ongoing dumpster fire, and Facebook's endless compromises of our personal security, consumers have turned a corner from thinking that large companies have their security acts together.  Perhaps what's surprising is not that people would choose better security over letting some company make their logins \"frictionless,\" but that they're willing to do something about it. That includes rage-quitting whoever screwed up their security. IBM's report found that in the wake of a breach, one in five users will stop using an affected app or service, or move to a competitor's service. The younger the user, the more likely they'll dump whoever got breached and take their trust somewhere else.  I can only imagine the amount of resentment building against companies people can't switch away from, like Equifax, Anthem (BlueCross BlueShield), or government agencies such as the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).  The debate about trade-offs between security and convenience is an old one. But now it looks like the idea that users do whatever is easiest is just as dated. Now people know the risks. And no one trusts companies with their security or privacy anymore.  \"For apps related to finances (banking, investing and budgeting),\" the study detailed, \"people vastly ranked security as top priority (70 percent on average) over privacy or convenience (16 percent and 14 percent respectively) -- yet when it came to social media, convenience took a slight lead (36 percent convenience, 34 percent security, 30 percent privacy).\"  One of the extra security steps making its way into mainstream use is biometrics, like fingerprint, face, retina, and palm scanning. Samsung is working on phones that scan your palm; LG wants to use your voice; the Galaxy S8 already uses retinal scans. A Dubai airport plans to replace security counters with facial recognition scans. Mastercard is adding fingerprint scanners to its credit cards. And of course, flagship Androids and iPhones all come with fingerprint and Face ID options.  It's all been met with conflicting reactions of excitement and anxiety from consumers, security professionals, and privacy pundits. Their concerns are all well-founded, and as my colleague Cherlynn Low put it, \"After Apple first put Touch ID on the iPhone 5s in 2013, people pointed out that it didn't work very well and that it wasn't secure.\"  Yet IBM's study shows biometric security to be an inevitability consumers are starting to embrace. Its data showed that 67 percent of respondents are comfortable with using biometrics for security, with a whopping 87 percent willing to consider using different types of biometric authentication in the future.  Even still, everyone's biggest concerns with biometrics are privacy and security. According to IBM, 55 percent of respondents are worried about how their data will be collected and used, with 50 percent saying they're concerned about people using faked biometric credentials to break into their accounts.  So maybe it's time for companies and their infosec advisors to start trusting users with more options for individuating the ways we can lock down our own security on their services. Instead of trying to corral us into whatever must-be-numbers-and-letters half-baked password recipe voodoo they think is best. While their own IT decision makers bump around in the dark prioritizing patches instead of actually applying them. I dunno. It's just a thought.

Britons of a certain age are likely to have used a BBC Micro, an education-focused machine created by Acorn Computer, as their first computer. The British company spent the late '70s and early '80s locked in a battle for computing dominance that would see it becoming a household name. Like the rest of the industry, it faced bankruptcy and ruin during the 1984 downturn that saw Apple go to the sword and Atari go under.  Acorn was, at the time, looking to develop its own chip architecture, the Acorn RISC Machine, better known these days as ARM. The spin off, co-owned by Acorn, Apple and VLSI, would belatedly becoming king of the mobile world, providing pretty much every phone with its brain. The company first collapsed in 2000, after its remaining divisions, since bought and sold several times, were shut down.  Subsequently, the name was purchased by a French reseller that used it to sell IBM-compatible PCs and accessories, including external hard drives.

Many people are waiting [for] me to announce that we are, uh, partnership with a carrier. Many of you guys have seen the newspapers that something is happened. That, uh, unfortunately this time, we cannot, uh, have this, uh, uh, to sell this phone, you know, from the carrier channel.\" Yu laughs nervously as he says this. \"Everybody knows that in the US market, that, uh ... over 90 percent of smartphones are sold by the carrier channels,\" he adds. Whether it's due to nerves or frustration, his almost-candid rantlet is refreshing, his motivation clear. Yu has had enough.  For years, Huawei has made phones that are well-received by global and American media alike. In the US, however, the company's devices are consistently criticized for not being sold through a carrier. Like Yu says, a vast majority of phones bought in the US are from carriers, and the apparent inability to make a phone that passes stringent carrier requirements not only limits Huawei's access to American customers but also makes the company seem incompetent.  The thing is, Huawei is anything but. In recent years, its phones have greatly improved in quality, especially when it comes to design. It seemed to have finally gained enough momentum to achieve carrier buy-in, with multiple reports saying the company had clinched AT&T's approval to sell the Mate 10 Pro. Yu's speech seems to confirm this, although he never mentions the reason for the dissolution of the partnership. The Information reported that political reasons were behind the last-minute pullout while Reuters said shortly after that Congress lobbied for AT&T to drop the deal.  In its official statement, Huawei doesn't directly address the deal and why it fell through. \"We have the strongest confidence in our products and will continue to innovate and break new ground. At the same time, we believe that U.S. consumers deserve equal opportunity and the choice to enjoy the best technology and more smartphone options through more channels, just like other satisfied Huawei users around the world,\" the company writes.  Huawei isn't the only major Chinese company with its eyes locked on America. Baidu, which is Google's equivalent in China, showed off a trio of smart speakers at CES, and company reps told Engadget that it definitely wants to bring its products to the US. Alibaba, also known as China's Amazon, also wants to establish a presence in America. But there are many challenges clouding these companies' ability to forecast a timeline.  In Baidu's case, tweaking its smart speakers for the US involves a complete overhaul. Its natural language interface DuerOS not only needs to be tailored for different consumer behavior but also has to learn an entirely new language (and all the associated nuances). Basically, American and Chinese people have different habits and tastes, and a product for one market cannot simply be reskinned to suit the other.  Chinese companies simply don't have a good reputation in the US.  Chinese companies also frequently have names that Americans find hard to pronounce, like Xiaomi and Huawei. This affects the consumer's ability to recall the brand when deciding what to buy, making it even more difficult for Chinese companies to appeal to the US market. The problem is so bad that Huawei has had to launch a massive ad campaign teaching Americans how to pronounce its name (\"who-ah way\" in Chinese, \"wah-way\" in Cantonese, \"wow way\" in the company's unfortunately inaccurate marketing material). Xiaomi, which is frequently mispronounced as \"show-me\" actually sounds closer to \"see-ow me.\"  But it's not just language and cultural differences that get in the way. Chinese companies simply don't have a good reputation in the US. Right after Yu's press conference at CES, Congress quickly proposed a bill to ban government agencies from working with Huawei and ZTE. These two companies were also the subject of a 2012 report from Congress claiming they \"cannot be trusted.\"  Huawei writes in its official statement that \"privacy and security are always our first priority. We are compliant with the world's most stringent privacy protection frameworks, including all GAPP and GDPR privacy protection requirements.\" Both ZTE and Huawei also stated back in 2012 that they felt they were being unfairly singled out in Congress' inquiry.", "stock": "IBM", "label": -1, "date": "2018-01-17", "source": "engadget", "url": "https://www.engadget.com/2018/01/17/huawei-china-us-tech-trade-relations/"}, {"article": "Fifty years ago next month, invitation-only audiences gathered in specially equipped Cinerama theaters in Washington, New York and Los Angeles to preview a widescreen epic that director Stanley Kubrick had been working on for four years. Conceived in collaboration with the science-fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke, \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey\u201d was way over budget, and Hollywood rumor held that MGM had essentially bet the studio on the project.  The film\u2019s previews were an unmitigated disaster. Its story line encompassed an exceptional temporal sweep, starting with the initial contact between pre-human ape-men and an omnipotent alien civilization and then vaulting forward to later encounters between Homo sapiens and the elusive aliens, represented throughout by the film\u2019s iconic metallic-black monolith. Although featuring visual effects of unprecedented realism and power, Kubrick\u2019s panoramic journey into space and time made few concessions to viewer understanding. The film was essentially a nonverbal experience. Its first words came only a good half-hour in.  Audience walkouts numbered well over 200 at the New York premiere on April 3, 1968, and the next day\u2019s reviews were almost uniformly negative. Writing in the Village Voice, Andrew Sarris called the movie \u201ca thoroughly uninteresting failure and the most damning demonstration yet of Stanley Kubrick\u2019s inability to tell a story coherently and with a consistent point of view.\u201d And yet that afternoon, a long line\u2014comprised predominantly of younger people\u2014extended down Broadway, awaiting the first matinee.  Stung by the initial reactions and under great pressure from MGM, Kubrick soon cut almost 20 minutes from the film. Although \u201c2001\u201d remained willfully opaque and open to interpretation, the trims removed redundancies, and the film spoke more clearly. Critics began to come around. In her review for the Boston Globe, Marjorie Adams, who had seen the shortened version, called it \u201cthe world\u2019s most extraordinary film. Nothing like it has ever been shown in Boston before, or for that matter, anywhere. The film is as exciting as the discovery of a new dimension in life.\u201d  \u2018Stanley and I are laughing all the way to the bank.\u2019  Although incomprehensible by prevailing Hollywood standards, Kubrick\u2019s cryptic, mostly dialogue-free structure fit well with the radical avant-garde artistic innovations of the period, and the movie was an immediate countercultural hit. John Lennon quipped, \u201c\u20182001\u2019? I see it every week,\u201d and David Bowie was inspired to record his hit single \u201cSpace Oddity\u201d just under a year later\u2014a clear allusion to the film. \u201c2001\u201d became a genuine late-\u201960s cultural happening and a bellwether of the decade\u2019s generational divide. With ticket sales brisk from day one, the production ended up the highest-grossing film of 1968. \u201cAs for the dwindling minority who still don\u2019t like it, that\u2019s their problem, not ours,\u201d Clarke wrote. \u201cStanley and I are laughing all the way to the bank.\u201d  Fifty years later, \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey\u201d is widely recognized as ranking among the most influential movies ever made. The most respected poll of such things, conducted every decade by the British Film Institute\u2019s Sight & Sound magazine, asks the world\u2019s leading directors and critics to name the 100 greatest films of all time. The last BFI decadal survey, conducted in 2012, placed it at No. 2 among directors and No. 6 among critics. Not bad for a film that critic Pauline Kael had waited a contemptuous 10 months before dismissing as \u201ctrash masquerading as art\u201d in the pages of Harper\u2019s.  Although the film\u2019s vision of humanity expanding throughout the solar system proved overoptimistic, its portrait of a screen-based, technology-mediated future now seems almost uncannily accurate, and it devastatingly evokes the dehumanization that can result from such communication. As for the cyclopean HAL-9000 supercomputer, often considered the most human character in \u201c2001,\u201d it foreshadowed our anxious contemporary discussion about the potentially dystopian impact of artificial-intelligence technologies.  The film\u2019s extraordinary predictive realism was entirely premeditated, the result of Kubrick and Clarke\u2019s questing, cerebral commitment to scientific and technical accuracy. By all accounts the production was run less like a big-budget Hollywood production than an extended futurological R&D exercise. A broad slate of top aerospace and computer companies were brought on board as consultants and advisers, with such leading innovators as IBM , Bell Labs and Hewlett-Packard all playing important roles.  In the summer of 1965, Kubrick received two detailed Bell Labs reports written by A. Michael Noll (a trailblazer in the development of digital arts and 3-D animation) and information theorist John R. Pierce (who coined the term \u201ctransistor\u201d and headed the team that built the first communications satellite). They recommended that the spacecraft systems in \u201c2001\u201d all feature multiple \u201cfairly large, flat and rectangular\u201d screens, with \u201cno indication of the massive depth of equipment behind them.\u201d Flat screens were, of course, unknown in the \u201960s\u2014at least outside of movie theaters\u2014and they helped to ensure 2001\u2019s futuristic sheen.  The film featured forward-looking flat-screen tablet computers. Photo: Mary Evans/Everett Collection  The role of the film\u2019s sentient supercomputer, originally named Athena, grew throughout the film\u2019s development, under the influence of discussions that Kubrick and Clarke held with MIT cognitive scientist and artificial intelligence pioneer Marvin Minsky and British cryptologist and mathematician I. J. Good. The computer\u2019s physical look resulted from advice provided by IBM\u2019s influential design bureau-think-tank\u2014the Apple Industrial Design Group of its day\u2014then led by industrial designer Eliot Noyes.  In July 1965, Noyes and his team provided drawings of astronauts floating within a kind of \u201cbrain room\u201d\u2014a concept that Kubrick initially rejected but later recognized as having intriguing dramatic possibilities. The astronaut Dave Bowman\u2019s methodical lobotomization of the computer after it\u2014or rather, \u201che\u201d\u2014had killed off the rest of the crew, conducted within the dappled red confines of the film\u2019s remarkable brain-room set, remains one of the most powerfully disturbing scenes ever committed to celluloid.  HAL stood for \u201cHeuristic Algorithmic,\u201d a Minsky suggestion. The computer\u2019s homicidal tendencies emerged only gradually, forcing the production to remove its original IBM nameplate and to substitute another acronym\u2014a kind of subliminal cognate, with \u201cHAL\u201d being displaced from \u201cIBM\u201d by only one letter in each case, something that both Kubrick and Clarke strenuously denied was intentional.  Another fascinating result of the production\u2019s consultation with Big Blue was the film\u2019s forward-looking flat-screen tablet computers, which retained their IBM logos and were called \u201cNewspads.\u201d Constructed long before such technologies were feasible, the movie\u2019s seemingly portable Newspads were actually welded to the tables on which they appeared casually placed, with hidden 16mm film projectors recessed underneath to provide content for their frosted-glass displays.  In the film\u2019s final cut, the Newspads were only used by the astronauts to watch a TV program ostensibly from the BBC and were thus largely indistinguishable from the various other displays embedded in the sets. But the production had received permission from the New York Times to use its logo, and Kubrick\u2019s designers had mocked up a digital front page for the Newspads, complete with multiple story choices to be accessed by touch-screen command. If the page had been used, the movie would almost certainly now be seen as having predicted the internet.  More than four decades later, however, the predictive futurism of \u201c2001\u201d was decisively ratified when Apple released its first iPad in 2010. Samsung issued a similar device a year later, and Apple immediately sued for patent infringement. That August the Korean company filed a response in federal court in San Jose, Calif., asserting that Apple couldn\u2019t possibly have invented the iPad because the device had already been envisioned in \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey.\u201d  Samsung\u2019s unusual defense, which featured both stills and YouTube links from the film, was ultimately ruled inadmissible as evidence, but it confirmed what many fans have long appreciated: the continuing relevance and still-startling prescience of Kubrick\u2019s masterpiece.  \u2014Mr. Benson is the author of \u201cSpace Odyssey: Stanley Kubrick, Arthur Clarke and the Making of a Masterpiece,\u201d which will be published on April 3 by Simon & Schuster.", "stock": "IBM", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-09", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-kubricks-2001-a-space-odyssey-saw-into-the-future-1520609361"}, {"article": "Even for IBM , IBM -0.86% growth doesn\u2019t quite solve everything.  International Business Machines reported Thursday that fourth-quarter revenue rose nearly 4% year over year. Even adjusting for a boost from favorable currency rates, Big Blue\u2019s top line managed its first period of growth in nearly six years. Strong sales of systems hardware business along with IBM\u2019s growing cloud-computing service contributed to the uplift.  Still, IBM\u2019s shares fell Friday, much like they have done following 10 of its last 12 quarterly reports. A bit of growth, as it turns out, isn\u2019t quite enough to assuage concerns about how the company gets there. Fourth-quarter gross margins slipped below the 50% line for the first time in five years for what is typically the company\u2019s strongest seasonal period. And, while IBM did project annual revenue growth for 2018, it is unclear if the company can do that without continued help from favorable exchange rates.  Given that IBM\u2019s stock had jumped more than 15% since its last quarterly report, some disappointment was bound to set in. The company also expects a slight drop in free cash flow in 2018 due to increased capital spending in key segments to drive future growth. IBM did manage to close 2017 with a small gain in adjusted per-share earnings of $13.80 after three years of declines. But the company also projected flat earnings for 2018, given its need to invest more in its business.  Those investments have borne some fruit. The \u201cstrategic imperatives\u201d IBM has been so focused on for the last few years accounted for 46% of total revenue for 2017, compared to 41% the year before. While encouraging, for an overall business that has been in steady decline for the last six years, investors are now willing to take only so much on faith.

Fourth-quarter revenue rose 3.6% to $22.54 billion. The last time IBM had revenue growth from the prior year was the first quarter of 2012, Ms. Rometty\u2019s first as chief.  Several factors drove growth in the latest quarter: sales of industrial-strength computers\u2014which the company typically refreshes every few years\u2014 rose 32% to $3.33 billion, while cloud-computing revenue climbed 30% to $5.5 billion. Also, currency exchange rates have been working in IBM\u2019s favor lately, accounting for 3 percentage points of the quarter\u2019s revenue growth after years of being a headwind.  IBM said it took a $5.5 billion charge related to the new U.S. tax law, helping to push it into the red for the period. Its tax rate, excluding the charge but including certain one-time benefits, was 6%.  In all, the company reported a fourth-quarter loss of $1.05 billion, or $1.14 a share, compared with profit of $4.5 billion, or $4.72 a share, a year earlier.  The loss stemmed partly from a deep erosion in profits in IBM\u2019s services business, showing IBM still has work to do. Pretax profit margins in the two services segments that manage large companies\u2019 software and hardware needs sank 35% and 23%, respectively, from a year ago. In its conference call with analysts, IBM described high investments and \u201clarge contract dynamics\u201d in those businesses.  Since becoming CEO, Ms. Rometty has struggled to shift IBM from older, shrinking businesses, such as selling and maintaining equipment in customers\u2019 own facilities, to newer ones that promise rapid growth.  She has staked out a position in helping large corporate customers integrate their traditional operations with cloud computing, and has focused on buzzy areas such as artificial intelligence and the Internet-based ledger technology known as blockchain.  But growth has been elusive, as even high-profile initiatives\u2014such as IBM\u2019s Watson AI, a collection of cloud tools as well as apps for industries including medicine and finance\u2014haven\u2019t delivered a clear financial boost.  Even some of Ms. Rometty\u2019s biggest fans have lost patience. IBM\u2019s largest and arguably most prominent stakeholder\u2014Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which invested more than $10 billion for a 5.4% stake in 2011\u2014sold more than half its holdings last year. Berkshire held about 37 million shares as of Sept. 30.  Shares of the 106-year-old tech company dropped 3.1% in after-hours trading after finishing Thursday\u2019s regular session with a marginal gain at $169.12. The price stands roughly where it did a year ago, while the S&P 500 index has risen more than 23%.  While achieving quarterly growth is noteworthy, IBM is working toward what it sees as a more significant milestone: getting more than half its revenue from so-called strategic imperatives \u2014 mostly newer technologies such as AI that customers can access in the cloud.  Revenue from strategic imperatives made up 49% of the total in the quarter, edging toward the point at which sales of the higher-growth offerings will outweigh the rest of IBM, heralding faster growth overall.  In an interview, James Kavanaugh, IBM\u2019s new finance chief, said the company is \u201cahead of track\u201d in working toward its goal of hitting an annual revenue rate of $40 billion for strategic imperatives by the end of this year.  \u201cThat gives us the confidence to say we\u2019re going to grow revenue overall in 2018,\u201d he said.  Jim Lebenthal, a portfolio manager at HPM Partners LLC, said there is evidence of Ms. Rometty\u2019s progress. He shed IBM in 2015 after \u201ca lot of disappointments\u201d but recently added the company to his stable of 20 stocks. He is betting IBM\u2019s newfound revenue growth is sustainable and that strategic imperatives will grow to more than 50% of sales in 2018.  When Ms. Rometty took the CEO reins from Samuel Palmisano in January 2012, revenue started slipping almost immediately and the threat of cloud computing to IBM\u2019s traditional businesses became evident. Ms. Rometty purchased cloud-computing platform SoftLayer Technologies Inc. the following year and committed to developing Watson into a flagship offering.  By 2014, it was clear IBM had diverged from Mr. Palmisano\u2019s financial road map for $20-a-share in profit by 2015. Ms. Rometty set aside that goal, reorganized the company around her strategic imperatives and redirected about $4 billion away from stock repurchases toward priorities such as Watson and the cloud, according to UBS AG analyst Steven Milunovich.  IBM\u2019s challenges now include holding on to its large customers as cloud leaders such as Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google beckon.  \u201cStrategic imperative revenue may cross over the core franchises later this year,\u201d Mr. Milunovich said, \u201cbut there are a lot of industry trends working against a large incumbent like IBM.\u201d  Hardware revenue rose 32%, driven by sales of mainframe computers\u2014on IBM\u2019s conference call with analysts, former finance chief Martin Schroeter called mainframes \u201can enduring and growing franchise\u201d\u2014which accounted for nearly 15% of total revenue in the quarter.  Those sales are critical, as they drive related sales of support services, software, storage and financing that historically have made up roughly 40% of IBM\u2019s operating profit, according to analyst Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein Research. They also can cement long-term customer relationships that drive recurring revenue such as software subscriptions, he said.  On an adjusted basis, which omits such items as acquisition- and retirement-related charges, IBM had profit of $5.18 a share, a penny more than the $5.17 expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters.  The Armonk, N.Y., company\u2019s guidance for 2018 called for operating earnings of $13.80 a share and free cash flow of about $12 billion.

IBM -0.86% is scheduled to announce fourth-quarter earnings after the market closes Thursday. Here\u2019s what to look for:  EARNINGS FORECAST: Analysts expect IBM to report earnings of $5.17 a share on an adjusted basis, which typically omits items such as acquisition- and retirement-related charges, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters. A year ago, IBM reported $5.01 in adjusted profit.  REVENUE FORECAST: Analysts expect total revenue of $22.05 billion for the quarter, up 1.3% from $21.77 billion a year earlier\u2014what would be the first growth after 22 consecutive quarters of declines.  WHAT TO WATCH:  GROWTH, BUT FOR HOW LONG?: One quarter of growth after more than five years of declines doesn\u2019t make a trend, some analysts caution. Fourth-quarter revenue was bolstered by two key factors, they say. First, foreign-exchange rates lately have shifted in IBM\u2019s favor after years of cutting into financial performance. They likely accounted for roughly 3% of revenue in the quarter, said Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein Research. Second, Q4 was the first full period that included sales of IBM\u2019s latest industrial-strength computers that process transactions for retailers, banks and the like. The mainframes, which IBM typically introduces every few years, typically boost revenue across several business lines. That effect is cyclical and bound to taper after a few quarters, Mr. Sacconaghi said.  SERVICES AHEAD: Knowing an eventual drop-off in mainframe revenue is down the line, investors will be looking for other areas to pick up the slack. IBM\u2019s two services segments, which include its consulting, IT hardware and software services and cloud operations, typically account for roughly 65% of total revenue. Both declined in recent quarters. \u201cFor IBM to get to revenue stability, which is what really matters for the stock multiple, services have to improve,\u201d said David Grossman of Stifel Financial Corp.  TAX IMPACT: Analysts are struggling to evaluate precisely how the U.S. tax-reform bill recently passed by Congress will affect IBM. The company has said its aggregate tax rate is around 15%, plus or minus 3 percentage points, but some analysts believe the new law may push it as high as 20%. The company held around $71 billion in cash overseas at the end of 2016, said Steve Milunovich of UBS AG , and repatriating some of that money could eat into earnings. IBM hasn\u2019t yet said what it expects to do with its stockpile in light of the new U.S. tax law.

The Senate and House, with the backing of the White House, are working on bipartisan legislation to broaden the authority of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., a multi-agency body that has oversight of deals that could lead to the transfer of sensitive technology to rival countries. The current CFIUS statute doesn\u2019t single out any country, but in recent years, the committee has often been focused on deals involving China.  Currently, CFIUS can recommend the president block foreign entities from buying majority stakes in U.S. companies; the new bill would let the committee make similar recommendations for deals involving minority investments and joint ventures, along with transactions that it determines involve \u201cemerging technologies.\u201d  The scope of the proposed legislation is broad. China requires foreign investors to form ventures with local partners, and Washington law firms say they are receiving a surge in inquiries over what it might mean for the large number of U.S. firms active in China. The country\u2019s huge size has made it a market of interest for companies ranging from auto makers like General Motors Corp. , technology companies like Cisco Systems Inc. or other manufacturers like Caterpillar Inc. \u2014all of which have local ventures in China.  It isn\u2019t clear how broadly the new law would be enforced. For now, the most vocal corporate opponents are a handful of U.S. companies that have determined the new law might crimp business prospects by requiring companies to get the blessing of CFIUS for some joint ventures that involve shared U.S. technology.  IBM Corp. , for instance, last year agreed with China\u2019s Wanda Internet Technology to share the cloud computing technology used in its Watson artificial intelligence system. Behind the strategy is the belief that embedding IBM\u2019s technology in China\u2019s business infrastructure would steer Chinese customers toward IBM as they seek future growth.  Other large U.S. corporations, from General Electric Co. to Microsoft Corp. , see China as a crucial market for similar reasons.  IBM, among others, has said the bill\u2014known as the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act\u2014would hurt U.S. companies\u2019 ability to compete globally. \u201cForeign competitors that do not face similar regulatory restrictions will seize global market opportunities while American companies are left watching from the sidelines,\u201d IBM\u2019s vice president of government and regulatory affairs, Christopher Padilla, testified at a recent Senate hearing.  Supporters of the bill, who think it could be signed into law later this year, aren\u2019t convinced. \u201cI am concerned that some of the recent witnesses before the House and Senate have major financial conflicts of interest that prohibit an objective evaluation of the security threats we face,\u201d Rep. Robert Pittenger (R., N.C.)\u2014one of the drafters of the bill\u2014said in an email.  \u201cThe business models for IBM, Microsoft, and GE, for example, have led to the transfer of military applicable technologies to China that have likely aided the modernization of the Chinese military and intelligence agencies,\u201d said Mr. Pittenger. The bill\u2019s supporters say it complements and strengthens export regulations rather than duplicating them.  IBM and other opponents, while acknowledging national-security concerns, have suggested existing export controls to counter China rather than expanding the reach of CFIUS. IBM didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.  In an email, GE said while it supports the idea of changes to CFIUS, \u201cit\u2019s also important that any reform support America\u2019s historical leadership in attracting foreign investment, not duplicate existing and well-established export control regimes, and preserve the ability of American companies to compete globally.\u201d The company declined an interview. Microsoft declined to comment.  Several security experts say China has been sidestepping controls by taking minority stakes in U.S. technology companies or entering joint licensing ventures.  \u201cThere\u2019s a very sophisticated and well-organized plan [by China] to acquire the technology and the reality is there are people here who want to sell it,\u201d said William Reinsch, who was the Commerce Department\u2019s undersecretary for export administration under President Bill Clinton.  And for many who have watched China easily avail itself of gaps in the CFIUS review process, the bill is the minimum that can be done in a fight that is likely to get much bigger. CFIUS blocked 10 deals between 2014 and 2016 over national-security concerns; China in recent years has accounted for the largest number of reviewed transactions.  \u201cThere\u2019s a big trade war shootout coming up with China that I think, frankly, is overdue,\u201d said Adm. Dennis Blair, co-chair of the Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property and a former U.S. director of national intelligence. He said among the key technologies right now are those involving artificial intelligence, data mining and pattern recognition.  How Bill Would Broaden CFIUS\u2019s Reach Expands CFIUS\u2019s jurisdiction to partnerships where a foreign firm doesn\u2019t have a controlling interest, such as joint ventures, minority investments and licensing deals.  Adds ability to review real-estate purchases or leases near military bases or other sensitive U.S. government properties.  Updates CFIUS\u2019s definition of \u201ccritical technologies\u201d to include emerging technologies that could be essential for maintaining U.S. technological advantage over countries that pose threats to national security.

Source: Proposed Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2017  Supporters point to recent deals that they say deserve greater scrutiny because they give China access to critical technology, such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc.\u2019s 2016 joint venture with China\u2019s Tianjin Haiguang Advanced Technology Investment Co., which gave the company access to technology similar to that used by Intel Corp. in its chips. Tianjin Haiguang didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.  AMD spokesman Drew Prairie said in an email that \u201csome commentators have mischaracterized\u201d the venture and that AMD received a \u201cU.S. government classification confirming that the technology was not restricted for export\u201d\u2014a reference to Commerce Department export controls. As for the CFIUS overhaul bill, Mr. Prairie said AMD supports strengthened security but wants to make sure it doesn\u2019t have \u201cunintended consequences.\u201d Dawning Information Industry Co. , the largest shareholder of Tianjin Haiguang, didn\u2019t respond to an email.  Many businesses are also supportive of the bill, including software maker Oracle Corp. , telecommunications firm Ericsson Inc., steelmaker Nucor Corp. and railroad-car-equipment maker Greenbrier Co s. Many say an expanded CFIUS would set needed ground rules for working with Chinese firms.  Even openly supporting the bill, some companies worry, could expose them to problems\u2014not in the U.S. but in China. They don\u2019t want to be blocked from entering deals in China, or prevented from selling products in its booming economy.  \u201cWe\u2019re quiet about our support because of fear of retaliation,\u201d said an executive at a large U.S. technology company.  \u2014Kersten Zhang and Ted Greenwald contributed to this article.

Shares of American Express fell 3.2% premarket. The financial services company recorded its first quarterly loss in over a quarter-century and said it would suspend its share-buyback program in the first half to rebuild capital as it absorbed a hit from tax changes in the U.S.  Nike shares climbed 2% to $65.41 premarket following a Wedbush Securities analyst upgrade to outperform from neutral. The analysts raised their price target on shares of the athletic apparel giant to $74 from $57.  Shares of Berkshire Hathaway rose 0.1% before the opening bell after the conglomerate revealed in SEC filings that longtime reinsurance executive Ajit Jain, who was recently added to the firm\u2019s board and could succeed Warren Buffett, holds more of the firm\u2019s shares than some other board members.  JPMorgan Chase shares were down 0.1% premarket.

One employee planning to depart\u2014a 47-year-old who has been with the car maker for a decade\u2014said Peugeot is offering him \u20ac10,500 ($12,950) to retrain. He wants to become a teacher.  \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten to a point where the company is no longer right for me, and I\u2019m no longer right for the company,\u201d he said. \u201cBetter a good divorce than a bad marriage.\u201d  Mr. Macron\u2019s approach could backfire, however, if companies use the new measures to cut staff without hiring new ones. France\u2019s economy is finally in recovery, with latest figures showing unemployment at the end of 2017 at 8.9%, its lowest level since early 2009. But Mr. Macron remains under pressure to bring that rate down further, and the country\u2019s powerful unions have their guard up against any evidence that the rules could cost jobs rather than create them.  Foreign businesses that have typically viewed France as a sinkhole for investment are also watching closely. Labor lawyers in Paris are already fielding calls from firms in the U.S. and elsewhere that \u201care interested in the possibility of moving fast in a consensual framework that isn\u2019t traumatic for their teams,\u201d said Claire Toumieux, a partner at law firm Allen & Overy.  IBM, based in Armonk, New York, plans to \u201chire aggressively in key skills areas\u201d in France in parallel to conducting layoffs using the new rules, a company spokeswoman said.  In September, Mr. Macron decreed myriad changes, including capping court-ordered fines for dismissals and giving companies greater powers to negotiate working conditions with employees. One part of the broad package is a measure that absolves companies from using lengthy, complex procedures for voluntary layoffs.  A broken window at a Paris branch of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale after a march in November against the French government\u2019s overhaul of labor laws. Photo: Michel Stoupak/NurPhoto/ZUMA Press  Previously a firm had to prove it was in financial difficulty before embarking on layoffs, even on a voluntary basis. Publicly traded firms were loath to declare they were struggling. Penalties for missteps in the procedure were high, and a company could ultimately be forced to hire back staff who left.  The new rules allow employers to instead negotiate a rupture conventionnelle collective\u2014a voluntary severance agreement for large numbers of employees\u2014regardless of the company\u2019s health.  \u201cIt\u2019s a complete change in philosophy,\u201d said David Jonin, a partner specializing in employment law at Gide Loyrette Nouel.  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale plans to use the measure to restructure its retail operations. As customers shift to online services, the bank is scrambling to close 300 of its 2,000 retail branches in France and automate 80% of the processes linking front and back offices. The plan, dubbed \u201cTransform to Grow,\u201d will entail 3,450 job cuts from its retail network between 2016 and 2020, the bank said in November.  Many of those cuts were expected to take place through attrition or the redeployment of staff to other units of the bank, but last month the bank disclosed it would also make use of the new rules.  Balancing Act Peugeot is using President Macron's labor measures to slash jobs this year and soften the blow with new recruits. 3,000 Apprentices 2,000 2,000 1,000 New hires  1,300  0  Layoffs  \u20131,000  1,300  Early  retirement  \u20132,000  900  \u20133,000  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale has scheduled talks with unions for later this month. Under the Macron law, any firm that wants to adopt the new scheme needs to win over a majority of its union representatives. In some cases that has emerged as a significant obstacle.  \u201cManagement is going too fast. When you want to get rid of so many jobs, you\u2019ve got to explain why,\u201d said Monique Motsch, a representative of the moderate CFDT union at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.  At French clothing retailer Pimkie, unions already shot down a Jan. 9 proposal to apply the new process, forcing the company to revert to France\u2019s older, more onerous system requiring the firm to show itself as being in financial distress.  Peugeot, in contrast, secured the support of its unions in a matter of days. The car maker threaded the needle by sweetening the layoff offers and combining them with 900 early-retirement offers and a plan to recruit and train higher-skilled employees. That includes 1,300 new positions and 2,000 apprentices.  \u201cPsychologically it\u2019s softer. There\u2019s no obligation to leave, everything is voluntary and it protects workers who want to stay,\u201d said Jean-Francois Kondratiuk, an employee representative who sits on Peugeot\u2019s supervisory board.  Workers who choose to stay at Peugeot are accepting more flexibility. Jean-Louis Thirot, 50, has agreed to train for a new job testing software for car electronics. The research center in the west of Paris where he currently works ordering parts is shutting down this year.  \u201cI\u2019m able to succeed because I can move internally,\u201d said Mr. Thirot, who has worked for Peugeot for more than three decades.  Others say they have recognized that a job at Peugeot is no longer the safe bet it once was. A 40-year-old technician whose father, brother and wife have all worked for the car maker said he thought he had a job for life when he joined the company in 2003. Now that Peugeot has outsourced nearly all of his department\u2019s work, he has decided to take the severance package.  \u201cI\u2019m the last of the Mohicans,\u201d he said.

Robert Pittenger\u2019s \u201cHow China Pushes the Limits on Military Technology Transfer\u201d (WSJ.com op-ed, March 14): Few Americans would argue against measures to make this country more secure, and most would agree that protecting national security requires the proper tools. Still, many more would agree that being factual when discussing this topic is absolutely critical.  Legislation recently introduced in Congress and advocated in these pages by Rep. Robert Pittenger would make some needed improvements to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (Cfius). For example, the measure would expand the ability of the government to block the purchase of buildings or other real estate near military installations.  But Mr. Pittenger\u2019s bill\u2014the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act\u2014goes much, much farther. It would drastically expand the mission of Cfius, an interagency committee staffed by fewer than a dozen people at the Treasury Department, bringing under government review countless international sales and licensing transactions by U.S. companies.  The new remit of Cfius would include such things as standard computer service and support contracts, technology manuals needed to operate machinery purchased by foreign customers and even the licensing of trademarks. Technologies that never were deemed sensitive by the Defense Department or that were long ago removed from control by the U.S. and its allies would be subject to new and opaque regulation by Cfius.  More concerning is that Mr. Pittenger\u2019s bill would do all of this unilaterally\u2014without any effort at cooperation with our allies. The U.S. does not have a monopoly on innovative technologies. Congress can impose all the restrictions it wants on U.S. businesses. But, if America does not work with allies to enact similar controls, we will fail to protect both national security and our economic competitiveness.  In making his case to expand Cfius, Rep. Pittenger has misrepresented the facts. He cites examples of technology sold overseas by IBM and other companies that the U.S. government itself long ago ruled were nonsensitive and able to be freely sold around the world without a government license. In fact, everything IBM has done globally complies with U.S. and foreign export-control laws. For instance, sharing widely published, open-source software, or technology to assemble computer servers that are years behind state of the art, isn\u2019t threatening and therefore not legally controlled for export. But assisting with China\u2019s high-performance computing project is rightly prohibited by U.S. law, and the assertion that IBM has done so is flatly untrue.  Instead of putting thousands of nonsensitive transactions under review by a small committee that has neither the staff nor the experience to handle them, the better approach would be to update the export-control system we already have. A bipartisan bill introduced by Reps. Ed Royce and Eliot Engel, leaders of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, would modernize export controls to deal with emerging challenges.  Congress could also require that technology controls be kept up-to-date. The Departments of Commerce and State\u2014which are today responsible for administering controls on dual-use and military technologies\u2014have between them 500 experts, a transparent process of licensing and deep technical knowledge. But the Militarily Critical Technologies List, mandated by Congress as the baseline for what to control, hasn\u2019t been updated by the Defense Department since 2011.  As recent history has shown, controlling sensitive technology works best when done internationally, with a sharp focus on those technologies that are the most critical. Casting too broad a net on routine business risks losing focus on the real threats. Creating a new bureaucracy, instead of modernizing the one we already have, would be misguided.  Rep. Pittenger should get his facts straight. And Congress should act, both to improve Cfius and to update export controls, but it should use the proper tools for the proper job.

Photo: Akos Stiller/Bloomberg News  Nvidia NVDA -1.32% may have only high-quality problems these days, but it still needs to solve them.  One problem the chip maker has is that it seems to be selling all the chips it can make. Nvidia\u2019s graphics processors, also called GPUs, are in hot demand by everyone from giant tech companies building data centers to videogamers to cryptocurrency enthusiasts. The latter two in particular are competing for the type of GPU cards used in supercharged PCs, causing a shortage that began last summer but seemed to have worsened later in the year as the value of cryptocurrencies continued to soar.  That gave a boost to what was already a strong year for Nvidia. Revenue from the company\u2019s gaming segment jumped 33% to a record $5.5 billion for the fiscal year ended Jan. 28. This included an unspecified contribution from crypto demand, as well as the chips the company sells to Nintendo that are used in its popular Switch console. Nvidia is a \u201cfabless\u201d chip company that outsources the actual manufacturing of its chips to others. CEO Jensen Huang said on the company\u2019s earnings call Thursday that it is working with its partners to \u201ccatch up to that demand.\u201d The recently ended fiscal year was the company\u2019s best ever. Sales jumped 41% to a record $9.7 billion, while operating income surged 66% to $3.2 billion\u2014another record. The company\u2019s operating margin for the year was also at a record high 33%, compared with 28% the previous year. Data center sales, representing chips sold to companies such as Google, Amazon and Microsoft to establish artificial intelligence capabilities in their networks, more than doubled during the year. That means Nvidia\u2019s main \u201cproblem\u201d for the year ahead is how to improve on perfection. Chances are that it can. Capital spending on data centers is expected to continue growing in the double-digit range this year. Gaming demand will remain strong as well, particularly with Nintendo boosting production of the Switch. Crypto is a wild card, with the value of those currencies swinging wildly of late, but Nvidia is wisely cautious about those customers, maintaining its focus on its gamer base and the burgeoning data center opportunity. Still, the company has a lot to live up to. Its stock defied Friday\u2019s turbulence to pick up 7% after already having surged nearly 90% in the previous 12 months. Nvidia\u2019s market value is now ahead of that of IBM \u2019s , with the shares fetching 37 times forward earnings. High expectations can set up disappointments down the road. Still, there are worse problems to have.

IBM is one of the big tech companies exploring ethical standards to guide the development of artificial intelligence. Photo: brian snyder/Reuters  WASHINGTON\u2014Technology companies are racing to get ahead of regulators to shape the future of artificial intelligence as it moves deeper into our daily lives.  Companies are already working artificial intelligence, or AI, into their business models, but the technology remains controversial. So IBM Corp. , Intel Corp. and associations representing Apple Inc., Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google unit are seeking to set ethical standards, or a sort of code of conduct, through alliances with futurists, civil-rights activists and social scientists.  Critics, however, see it as an effort to blunt outside regulation by cities, states or the federal government, and they question if tech companies are best suited to shape the rules of the road. For the corporations, the algorithms will be proprietary tools to assess your loan-worthiness, your job application, and your risk of stroke. Many balk at the costs of developing systems that not only learn to make decisions, but that also explain those decisions to outsiders.  When New York City proposed a law in August requiring that companies publish source code for algorithms used by city agencies, tech firms pushed back, saying they needed to protect proprietary algorithms. The city passed a scaled-back version in December without the source-code requirement.  \u201cThey\u2019re hiding behind trade secrets so you can\u2019t even get a look at what people are doing,\u201d said Ryan Calo, a University of Washington law professor who has advised Congress members on AI issues.  AI, broadly speaking, refers to computers mimicking intelligent behavior, crunching big data to make judgments on anything from avoiding car accidents to where the next crime might happen.  Yet computer algorithms aren\u2019t always clear on their logic. If a computer consistently denies a loan to members of a certain sex or race, is that discrimination? Will regulators have the right to examine the algorithm that made the decision? What if the algorithm doesn\u2019t know how to explain itself?  From the Archives Executives from Baidu, Intel, Samsung and Walmart talk about how artificial intelligence will soon redefine our technological lives. They speak at the WSJ D.Live conference in Laguna Beach, Calif. (Originally published Oct. 18, 2017)  The Obama administration sought to address these issues. Under Mr. Obama, the Office of Science and Technology Policy issued white papers on the ethical implications on AI. Under Mr. Trump, the office still doesn\u2019t have a director, and its staff is down to about 45, from about 130. A spokesman for the office declined to comment.  For now, the Trump administration has signaled it wants business to take the lead. The administration is worried overarching regulation could constrain innovation and make the U.S. less competitive, Michael Kratsios, the deputy in charge of tech policy at the Office of Science and Technology Policy, said at a conference in February. He noted China\u2019s push into artificial intelligence, which it is doing without much ethical quibbling.  \u201cWe\u2019re not looking for, or will be endorsing, broad, high level guidelines about AI rules,\u201d Mr. Kratsios said. He called it \u201ckey\u201d to create \u201cthe regulatory environment that ensures that the next great technologies happen here in the U.S.\u201d  In the past six months, Intel, IBM, Workday Inc. and the Washington, D.C.-based Information Technology Industry Council\u2014whose members include Facebook, Apple and Google\u2014all issued principles on the ethical use of artificial intelligence. In January, Microsoft Corp. put out an entire book on \u201cArtificial Intelligence and its Role in Society.\u201d  In 2016, some of the biggest tech companies founded an ethics-setting organization called the Partnership on Artificial Intelligence to Benefit People and Society, based in San Francisco. There are many others with at least some industry funding, including Open AI, the AI Now Institute, doteveryone, and the Center for Democracy & Technology.  Proposed rules have ranged from specific guidelines for government use, to requirements that any algorithm be able to explain its process to consumers. Many would apply existing regulations to AI case-by-case, adapting aviation rules to drones or applying privacy protections to personal data in algorithms.  Setting rules is complicated because companies often can\u2019t explain how their more complex systems, called \u201cdeep neural networks,\u201d arrive at answers. Last year, University of Washington researchers reported that an algorithm that had learned\u2014by itself\u2014to distinguish between wolves and husky dogs appeared to be doing so by noticing snow on the ground in the wolf pictures, not because of any insight into the animal.  \u201cGoogle, Facebook, those guys are very interested in performance and making these programs as smart as they can,\u201d said Dave Gunning, who leads a project into making algorithms explain their processes for the government\u2019s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.  \u201cExplainability is not as important to them,\u201d Mr. Gunning said. Google and Facebook didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.  At least one business executive, Elon Musk, founder and chief executive of Tesla Inc. and SpaceX, has cut back his role in the ethical research group he co-founded, Open AI. Mr. Musk quit the group\u2019s board in February. The group said he wanted to \u201celiminate a potential future conflict of interest\u201d with his role at Tesla, which is developing AI systems. He remains an Open AI adviser and funder.  Some in Congress are taking up the ethical debate. Washington Sen. Maria Cantwell and Maryland Rep. John Delaney, both Democrats, led a bipartisan bill introduced in December to establish a federal advisory council on the technology\u2019s potential impact. There is also an AI caucus on the Hill, started in may, and committees have been holding hearings on AI, algorithms and autonomous vehicles.

Oxford Economics, a forecasting and consulting firm, estimates the legislation will contribute 0.4 percentage points to already-robust economic growth in 2018, and another 0.1 to 0.2 points in 2019, said Gregory Daco, head of U.S. economics for the consultancy.  About half of that is likely to come from business spending, and the rest from households, Mr. Daco said. Oxford estimates that each $1 of corporate tax cut will lead to 40 cents of spending, based on historical precedent, Congressional Budget Office studies and conversations with corporate executives.  That\u2019s mostly a one-time gain. A reduction in taxes frees up profits to spend, but that then becomes the new normal, with further growth coming from general economic expansion or other factors.  At Amicus Therapeutics, the new tax law solved a geographic dilemma. The Cranbury, N.J., company is developing an experimental drug to treat Pompe disease, a rare inherited disorder that causes muscle weakness and can be fatal.  After early results for a new drug proved promising, Amicus wanted to increase production for further clinical testing and potential commercial sales.  Amicus, which has been using Chinese contract manufacturer WuXi Biologics to supply the drug, decided in August to build its own facility. The U.S. was at a disadvantage to Europe, due to its 35% statutory federal income-tax rate for companies. Ireland\u2019s corporate tax rate, by contrast, is 12.5%.  Those financial considerations threatened to overshadow other advantages that a U.S. plant would offer, including the ease with which company officials could visit it, and the availability of talented workers in some regions.  \u201cOur strong assumption was that it would be very challenging to establish a new bio-manufacturing facility in the U.S.,\u201d Chief Executive John Crowley said in an interview.  As the tax legislation advanced in Congress last fall, however, building in the U.S. began to look more attractive. On Dec. 21, a day after Congress passed the final measure, which lowered the statutory corporate rate to 21%, Mr. Crowley recommended to his board the company focus on finding a U.S. site. The company has narrowed its choice to three East Coast cities Mr. Crowley declined to identify, and expects to decide in the next month or two. It expects the plant to cost $150 million to $200 million, and to employ at least 200 people at an average pay of $100,000 a year.  Amicus Therapeutics Chief Executive John Crowley, right, chose the U.S. over Europe for a new production facility. Photo: Melissa Golden for The Wall Street Journal  \u201cWith the changes in the tax law, it now makes the U.S. competitive with these geographies we\u2019re looking at,\u201d he said.  The rules of deal making, too, are changing. In the past two months, Aramark completed two acquisitions with a price tag of $2.35 billion as it snapped up hotel procurement and supply firm Avendra in December and uniform-rental and linen-supply firm AmeriPride Services Inc. last week.  Both are a kind of deal that, thanks to the new tax law, has become cheaper. One provision lets companies deduct the cost of buying some sorts of assets immediately, instead of over several years as prior tax law required\u2014and expanded this treatment to used assets as well as new ones.  That essentially lets a buyer like Aramark get an immediate discount on the cash cost of part of its deals, the portion that reflects the acquisition of equipment, machinery and other tangible property.  Aramark\u2019s acquisition of Avendra, a partnership, is automatically treated as an asset purchase, New York tax consultant Robert Willens notes, while deal documents indicate Aramark and AmeriPride agreed to treat that acquisition as an asset purchase as well for tax purposes. (Although the Avendra deal closed in December, the new tax treatment applies to assets acquired after late September.)  \u201cThe cost of deals structured in this manner have taken a turn for the better,\u201d Mr. Willens said. \u201cYou\u2019re getting a full 21% discount.\u201d  In news releases, Aramark described its after-tax cost for the two deals as $1.86 billion, 21% less than the pretax price. Aramark said in a statement that it continues to evaluate the impact of the new tax law with accounting firm KPMG LLP, and plans to update investors on the acquisitions when it reports quarterly earnings on Feb. 6.  The same provision, speeding up tax deductions for capital spending, has prompted Kimberly-Clark, the diaper- and tissue-maker, to accelerate at least one major project, CEO Tom Falk said. The company\u2019s board votes next month on a U.S. factory retooling expected to cost hundreds of millions of dollars. There wasn\u2019t a timeline for the project previously.  \u201cIt gives us more incentive to invest, particularly in the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Falk said in an interview. \u201cThe project made sense before the tax benefit. It makes more sense after the tax benefit.\u201d  Similar reconsiderations are under way elsewhere. At United Natural Foods Inc., a grocery distributor with about 10,000 employees and more than $9 billion in annual revenue, the tax law has prompted a wholesale re-evaluation.  Projects previously viewed as risky are being given new consideration, Mike Zechmeister, the company\u2019s finance chief, said in an interview. The return on investment improved by 4 percentage points on a warehousing project in the Pacific region of the U.S. that the company had already decided to pursue, he said, primarily because of the new lower tax rate.  \u201cIt\u2019s going to impact all the decisions we make,\u201d Mr. Zechmeister said. \u201cAlmost all investments look better from an investment standpoint because we won\u2019t have to pay as much tax.\u201d  Grocery distributor United Natural Foods Inc. is investing to overcome capacity bottlenecks. Photo: United Natural Foods  The tax break comes at a particularly good time for United Natural Foods, which has struggled to keep pace with surging demand for natural and organic goods. The company\u2019s net sales rose 8% year-over-year during its last quarter to $2.5 billion, driven largely by Whole Foods, the chain acquired by Amazon.com Inc . last year and United Natural\u2019s biggest customer.  That sudden growth proved costly. The Providence, R.I., company had an additional $25 million in lost sales from out-of-stock goods during its last quarter, along with higher labor costs and storage fees. Any expansion would help ease capacity bottlenecks that the company intends to resolve in coming months.  Some companies are holding pat, either because they want to see how the new rules shake out, or because they are worried about moving too fast.  Verizon said it would use most of its tax savings\u2014$3.5 billion to $4 billion in extra cash in 2018\u2014to pay down some of its $117 billion debt, rather than increase investments. It will also donate to its charity and give employees company stock.  Mr. McAdam, the Verizon CEO, said the wireless giant would remain disciplined about capital spending. \u201cIt\u2019s very inconsistent that just because tax reform comes through, we are all of a sudden going to draw the line at a different place or lose that discipline,\u201d he said on Tuesday.  Several firms have announced plans to plow most of their tax savings into dividends or share repurchases, about a third of which flow to foreign investors, by some estimates.  Bank of America Corp. is exploring how it might invest in branches, technology and its workforce, CEO Brian Moynihan told investors last week. \u201cHowever, to be clear, we\u2019d expect most of the benefits from tax reform will flow to the bottom line through dividends and share buybacks over time,\u201d he added. A spokesman said payouts to shareholders will also help local economies.  The tax overhaul is altering corporate operations in sometimes surprising ways. Netflix Inc., for example, has changed the compensation it will pay three of its top officers, raising their salaries by a combined $19 million.  Its reasoning: The new tax law prevents companies from deducting any sort of pay over $1 million apiece for key executives. Prior law allowed companies to deduct that pay if it was tied to performance. So, having lost the benefit of a tax deduction for paying performance-based bonuses instead of salary, Netflix announced days after the tax law was passed that its board was scrapping the performance measures and converting the pay into straight salary instead, as it used to do before 2014.  The tax-law change is likely to eliminate tax deductions on $92 billion of pay, according to an analysis of Russell 3000 firms by Equilar. Several large companies\u2014including Johnson Controls International PLC and drugmaker AmerisourceBergen Corp. \u2014have said their boards are considering how the tax change affects their approach to compensation. Willis Towers Watson , a compensation-consulting firm, found that 40% of 333 employers it surveyed were either considering executive-pay changes or had already made some.  The ripple effects are hitting small businesses, too. Matthew Wells, president of Western Mechanical Contractors Inc. in Federal Way, Wash., is considering whether to restructure how his business is organized to maximize his benefits under the new tax law.  The 32-person plumbing and mechanical contracting firm is currently set up as an S corporation, a so-called pass-through structure in which the business itself isn\u2019t taxed and its income goes to the owners, who reflect it on their individual tax returns.  Mr. Wells is trying to determine whether his tax bill would fall if he switched to a C corporation, which pays its own income taxes directly to the Internal Revenue Service\u2014now at a 21% rate, down from a top rate of 35% before the new law.  Mr. Wells\u2019 accountant is still poring over the new law, but has suggested the potential benefits may not be as great as the contractor initially believed. \u201cI think they are going to try and talk us out of it,\u201d said Mr. Wells. \u201cBut it is certainly something we are looking into.\u201d  Christmas may be over but WSJ\u2019s Richard Rubin keeps the holiday spirit alive by explaining who\u2019s getting presents and who\u2019s getting coal with the GOP tax bill.  \u2014Sharon Terlep, Ruth Simon and Ryan Knutson contributed to this article.

Blockchain has the power to transform all these industries for three reasons. First, it\u2019s genuinely well-suited to transactions that require trust and a permanent record. Second, blockchain typically requires the cooperation of many different parties. In cases where it\u2019s implemented as open source software, it avoids the collective-action problem\u2014the disincentives that prevent individuals from adopting something that would benefit them collectively\u2014that occurs when a single company tries to push, and benefit from, a new standard.  The third reason is that hype I mentioned. The current excitement around cryptocurrency gives blockchain the visibility to attract developers and encourage adoption. Companies that have taken an \u201cIf it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it\u201d attitude toward back-office processes and logistics IT might be ready to spend big on updating those systems when they hear the buzzword \u201cblockchain.\u201d  In this way, blockchain resembles another buzzword, \u201cthe cloud.\u201d While detractors argued that the cloud was just \u201csomeone else\u2019s computer,\u201d it gave many industries new business processes, new ways to charge for services, disruptive startups and new divisions within existing companies and an ecosystem of supporting technologies. Blockchain has the same potential.  Blockchain All the Things  Take logistics. Already, 1.1 million items sold or on sale at Walmart are on a blockchain\u2014including chicken and almond milk\u2014helping the company trace their journey from manufacturer to store shelf. Global shipping giant Maersk uses the same technology from IBM to track shipping containers, making it faster and easier to transfer them and get them through customs.  While these projects are still a fraction of the overall tracking that goes on at these giants, they are expanding rapidly both within the organizations and across their industries. Other companies using blockchain technology to track goods include Kroger, Nestl\u00e9, Tyson Foods and Unilever, with many more yet to be announced, says Bridget van Kralingen, senior vice president of platforms and blockchain at IBM.  Everledger, a company started in April 2014 with the intention of creating a blockchain-based registry of every certified diamond in the world, already has 2.2 million diamonds in its registry. It\u2019s adding about 100,000 diamonds a month, says Leanne Kemp, chief executive and founder.  Related Blockchain May Offer a R\u00e9sum\u00e9 You Can Trust  By recording 40 different measures of each stone, including \u201cphysically unclone-able features,\u201d Everledger is able to trace the journey of a stone from when it\u2019s pulled from the earth to the day it\u2019s purchased by a consumer. Every participant in that chain, from the miner to the cutter to the retailer, maintains a node\u2014with a complete copy of the database\u2014in the Everledger blockchain network.

CartaSense customers, rather than physically handing off scanned and signed paper documents, use a blockchain database on which freight companies can record every stage of the journey of a package, pallet or shipping container. Kuehne + Nagel, one of the world\u2019s largest freight companies, is one of CartaSense\u2019s clients.  Replacing Regulations With Code  Blockchain is being implemented first within companies and centralized governments that can move quickly on new technologies.  Dubai, for example, has declared its intent to make itself the \u201cfirst blockchain-powered government in the world by 2020.\u201d That could streamline things in real estate, says Stephen McKeon, an associate professor of finance at the University of Oregon who studies blockchain. By moving the central record of all real-estate transactions onto a blockchain, Dubai could make it faster and easier to transfer property titles.  Because such \u201csmart contracts\u201d on a blockchain are code, they can contain rules about how they can be modified or transferred. In this way, blockchain could become a way to transfer the obligation of enforcement from bureaucrats to computers. For example, to prevent fraud, titles could be transferable only to certain accounts, or might transfer only after another condition, such as the transfer of funds in escrow, is met.  Dubai has vowed to become the \u2018first blockchain-powered government in the world by 2020.\u2019 Photo: Rustam Azmi/Getty Images  It\u2019s too early to say whether blockchain, as both a technology and a movement, has the power to overcome issues that thwarted generations of software engineers. The most justifiable skepticism is that blockchain is incremental rather than revolutionary. In some cases, it isn\u2019t much more than a marketing term imposed on systems that hardly differ from existing databases. (There\u2019s a healthy debate about what blockchain even means, and even companies like CartaSense call their system a \u201cblockchain-like technology.\u201d)  But if it works, it has the potential to be a fundamental enabling technology, the way new standards for transmitting data across networks led to the internet. More concretely, it could someday underlie everything from how we vote to who we connect with online to what we buy.

AT&T is among the last large telecom companies looking to unload its platform of data centers. Photo: stephanie keith/Reuters  AT&T Inc. T -0.06% has reignited a sales process for its data-center business.  The telecom company has engaged Bank of America Corp. to explore a divestiture of its data centers, said people familiar with the matter.  The data-center business generates about $135 million of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, the people said. They said they expect the unit to garner an Ebitda multiple in the high-single-digit range\u2014roughly $1 billion or more\u2014based on the quality of the facilities.  AT&T previously had weighed a sale of its data-center and managed-hosting businesses with Citigroup Inc., some of the people said. Ultimately, it sold only the hosting business, which IBM Corp. purchased in 2015.  The Dallas wireless carrier is among the last large telecom companies looking to unload its platform of data centers\u2014facilities equipped with networked computers, storage devices and servers. Last year, Verizon Communications Inc. sold its portfolio of data centers to Equinix Inc. for $3.6 billion, while that same year CenturyLink Inc. sold its facilities for $2.3 billion to a consortium led by private-equity firm BC Partners. In 2015, Windstream Holdings Inc. divested its data-center business to TierPoint for $575 million.  AT&T is looking to sell the capital-intensive data centers to better focus on its core wireless and video businesses. The process is still ongoing, however, and may not result in a deal. The facilities will require investment and attention from prospective acquirers, said some of the people familiar with the business.  Shedding the data centers could give AT&T extra cash to pay down the cost of acquiring Time Warner Inc., if that deal materializes. The company offered $85 billion in cash and stock for the owner of HBO, CNN and other media assets before the federal government challenged the deal on antitrust grounds. A trial to decide the proposed merger\u2019s fate is slated to begin March 19.  AT&T is selling its data facilities as strong appetite from both cash-rich strategic buyers and new entrants like infrastructure firms, are driving up prices for such assets. The sector continues to expand rapidly as organizations consume larger amounts of data and outsource more information-technology services.  Private-equity firms, in particular, have played a big role in consolidating the data-center industry, drawn to its expansion trajectory and a contracts-driven business model that promises steady cash flow. Over the past decade, investors have successfully built platforms that today are part of bigger conglomerates.  Recent transactions in the sector include Iron Mountain Inc.\u2019s acquisition of IO Data Centers LLC for $1.34 billion, private equity-backed Peak 10 Inc.\u2019s acquisition of ViaWest Inc. for 2.3 billion Canadian dollars and Digital Realty Trust Inc.\u2019s purchase of DuPont Fabros Technology Inc. for $4.95 billion.  \u2014Drew FitzGerald contributed to this article.

The East African country, an important player on the continent in the U.S. war on terror, has been mired in political uncertainty after two fraught elections and bursts of violence.  In a news conference, President Uhuru Kenyatta and opposition leader Raila Odinga \u2014who has refused to concede the vote\u2014promised dialogue, and said they would soon roll out a specific path to reconciliation.  \u201cWe shall bring a process of bringing of our people together, and find out what really divides our nation,\u201d Mr. Kenyatta said. \u201cWe must bring together all our people where no single person is left behind.\u201d  Mr. Tillerson\u2019s arrival, after stops in Ethiopia and Djibouti, reflects Kenya\u2019s role as a top ally in combating al-Shabaab, the al Qaeda affiliate in Somalia. Nairobi is also home to regional headquarters to some major U.S. corporations like IBM , Google and Coca-Cola .  Mr. Tillerson congratulated the two men in a news conference in Nairobi later Friday, and he played down the U.S. role in the sudden reconciliation.  \u201cThe U.S. obviously has been very supportive of Kenya\u2019s journey moving forward after what\u2019s been a difficult election period,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was very important action on their part to show that they are ready to work on behalf of all Kenyans \u2026 all the credit goes to the two leaders this morning.\u201d  Ahead of the visit, a senior State Department official said the U.S. had extensively engaged with Mr. Odinga to bring about reconciliation.  \u201cWhat we said to him ... is that you have a really tremendous opportunity for historic times to really push forward political and economic reforms,\u201d said acting assistant Secretary of State for Africa Donald Yamamoto.  The U.S. diplomatic mission has been involved in attempting mediation as the political crisis deepened.  In the past few months, anti-U.S. sentiment has been on the rise. Opposition supporters saw U.S. recognition of Mr. Kenyatta as a partisan move, and protesters demonstrated outside the U.S. embassy earlier this year over what they called U.S. interference.  Unrest following the two elections led to dozens of fatalities and has reopened the ethnic rifts that in 2007 left more than 1,000 people dead in postelection violence.  Mr. Odinga, who represents a large swath of the population who feel cut off from the country\u2019s elite, has accused Mr. Kenyatta of being a dictator and declared himself the \u201cpeople\u2019s president.\u201d  On Friday he shook Mr. Kenyatta\u2019s hand and promised to \u201cend these differences.\u201d  \u201cWe need to save our children from ourselves,\u201d Mr. Odinga said.  The surprise moves comes amid an escalation of a standoff that started last year ahead of August presidential elections.  In a first for Africa, the outcome of those elections was annulled by the country\u2019s Supreme Court, which ruled they had been marred by irregularities. Mr. Odinga boycotted new elections in October. Only one in three Kenyans took part, and Mr. Kenyatta was re-elected to another 5-year term with 98% of the vote.  Kenya\u2019s economy, a pole for international investment where Chinese-built mega infrastructure like a $4-billion dollar railway runs alongside an equally ambitious highway being built by U.S. construction giant Bechtel, felt the pain of the prolonged crisis.  Its growth rate, previously among the continent\u2019s highest at above 6%, and multiple times the world average, slowed down to 4.8% in 2017, according to the International Monetary Fund.  The Kenyan shilling inched higher against the dollar soon after the joint statement by the two leaders.

Singapore-based Broadcom\u2019s $117 billion bid for Qualcomm faces concerns by U.S. regulators worried about potential Chinese influence on the company and U.S. ability to influence the creation of the next generation of mobile networks, called 5G.  Qualcomm has sought assurances from Broadcom over potential antitrust issues.  Intel is mostly known for making chips that are the brains of personal computers and data centers, though it has made progress gaining smart phone manufacturing customers such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O).  If Broadcom buys Qualcomm, Intel would face a much bigger competitor, nearly equal to itself in market heft.  Broadcom and Qualcomm are worth close to $100 billion each and a combination would be the biggest tech deal ever. An Intel deal would be significantly bigger, since its market capitalization alone is nearly $240 billion.  The Journal reported that Intel had been considering a Broadcom bid since late last year and was working with advisers, although the newspaper said one of its sources described a bid as unlikely given the complexity of the combination.  Still, antitrust consultant Linley Gwennap said Intel likely could convince regulators to allow it to take over Broadcom, despite the size, since the companies largely make different types of microchips.  VLSI Research chief Dan Hutcheson agreed. \u201cThere\u2019s product overlap, but it\u2019s really inconsequential,\u201d he said.", "stock": "INTC", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-09", "source": "reuters", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/broadcom-ma-intel/update-1-intel-casts-doubt-on-report-of-interest-in-broadcom-idUSL4N1QR5RG"}, {"article": "(Reuters) - Intel Corp said on Friday shareholders and customers had filed 32 class action lawsuits against the company in connection with recently-disclosed security flaws in its microchips.

Intel said in a regulatory filing it was not able to estimate the potential losses that may arise out of the lawsuits.  Security researchers at the start of January publicized two flaws, dubbed Spectre and Meltdown, that affected nearly every modern computing device containing chips from Intel, Advanced Micro Devices Inc and ARM Holdings.  The companies have issued fixes but some patches slowed down computers, leading sector analysts to say producers could potentially face suits from clients and consumers claiming damages because their devices did not work as they should.  The company said the remaining two suits were securities class actions, where the plaintiffs allege that Intel and some of its officers violated securities laws by making statements about products or its internal controls that were later revealed to have been false or misleading.  The company\u2019s filing also listed three individual Intel shareholders who had filed actions against members of Intel\u2019s board and other managers, alleging that they failed their duties to Intel by failing to take action in relation to alleged insider trading.  It did not specify what allegations of wrongdoing the suit dealt with.  Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich sold 889,879 shares in the company on Nov. 29 as per a trading plan adopted on Oct. 30, making roughly $39 million from the sale, well before the details of the flaw were made public.  Bloomberg reported last month that although Intel says Krzanich\u2019s sales were part of a pre-arranged stock plan, securities lawyers believed the larger-than-usual transaction could be examined by the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC).  Krzanich said last month that Google researchers told Intel of the flaws \u201ca while ago\u201d.  Google says it informed the affected companies about the Spectre flaw on June 1, 2017 and reported the Meltdown flaw after the first flaw but before July 28, 2017.

REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo  Qualcomm has been a supplier of components to Apple for years but the relationship turned sour last year when Apple accused Qualcomm of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates.  In a detailed note citing extensive channel checks with chip suppliers, brokerage Nomura Instinet said it anticipated that Apple would drop Qualcomm in favour of a handful of other suppliers, as it seeks to reduce materials costs for iPhones.  Nomura said it believed Apple would source all of its thin modems - half of which are currently supplied by Qualcomm - from Intel.  Intel shares were up 1.4 percent at $46.81. The world\u2019s biggest PC chipmaker was a late entrant into the market for mobile chips, but has recently been pushing aggressively into the space.  \u201cThere is speculation that Apple might drop Qualcomm altogether for its next generation phones and I think that\u2019s part of the reason the stock is down today,\u201d said Angelo Zino, an analyst at CFRA Research.  Qualcomm issued a revenue forecast last week that missed estimates. It said the forecast already included the assumption that Apple could drop its chips for future products.  Apple will save more than $100 million in the next iPhone cycle by moving to cheaper Intel modem chips, Nomura analyst Romit Shah said.  Broadcom Ltd, which is trying to acquire Qualcomm, will likely lose some $400 million worth of sales of Apple parts in the second half of the year to Qorvo Inc, Shah added.  The reports came as Broadcom on Monday sweetened its bid to buy Qualcomm to more than $121 billion from an earlier $103 billion.  Qualcomm was hit with a $1.23 billion fine by European Union antitrust regulators last month for paying Apple to use only its chips, blocking out rivals such as Intel.  Intel began supplying modem chips to Apple from the iPhone 7 onwards.  Reuters reported in October that Apple had designed iPhones and iPads that would drop chips supplied by Qualcomm. reut.rs/2nNkkGC  Analysts at KGI Securities said Intel's modem chips were less expensive than Qualcomm chips and also met Apple's standards, according to Apple news website 9to5Mac. bit.ly/2FKdoBB  Sector analysts have said in the past that Intel may not be as well prepared for 5G networking as Qualcomm, and that iPhones with Qualcomm chips have performed better than models running on Intel chips.

Intel logo is seen behind LED lights in this illustration taken January 5, 2018. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illutration  Current and former U.S. government officials have raised concerns that the government was not informed of the flaws before they became public because the flaws potentially held national security implications. Intel said it did not think the flaws needed to be shared with U.S. authorities as hackers had not exploited the vulnerabilities.  Intel did not tell the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team, better known as US-CERT, about Meltdown and Spectre until Jan. 3, after reports on them in online technology site The Register had begun to circulate.  US-CERT, which issues warnings about cyber security problems to the public and private sector, did not respond to a request for comment.  Details of when the chip flaws were disclosed were detailed in letters sent by Intel, Alphabet and Apple Inc on Thursday in response to questions from Representative Greg Walden, an Oregon Republican who chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The letters were seen by Reuters.  Alphabet said that security researchers at its Google Project Zero informed chipmakers Intel, Advanced Micro Devices Inc and SoftBank Group Corp-owned ARM Holdings of the problems in June.  It gave the chipmakers 90 days to fix the issues before public disclosing them, standard practice in the cyber security industry intended to give the targets of bugs time to fix them before hackers can take advantage of the flaws.  Alphabet said it left the decision of whether to inform government officials of the security flaws up to the chipmakers, which is its standard practice.  Intel said it did not inform government officials because there was \u201cno indication that any of these vulnerabilities had been exploited by malicious actors,\u201d according to its letter.  Intel also said it did not perform an analysis of whether the flaws might harm critical infrastructure because it did not think it could affect industrial control systems. But Intel said that it did inform other technology companies that use its chips of the issue, according to its letter.  Intel, Alphabet and Apple could not immediately be reached for comment.

Apple Inc. is planning to use its own chips in Mac computers beginning as early as 2020, replacing processors from Intel Corp., according to people familiar with the plans.  The initiative, code named Kalamata, is still in the early developmental stages, but comes as part of a larger strategy to make all of Apple\u2019s devices -- including Macs, iPhones, and iPads -- work more similarly and seamlessly together, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. The project, which executives have approved, will likely result in a multi-step transition.  The shift would be a blow to Intel, whose partnership helped revive Apple\u2019s Mac success and linked the chipmaker to one of the leading brands in electronics. Apple provides Intel with about 5 percent of its annual revenue, according to Bloomberg supply chain analysis.  Intel shares dropped as much as 9.2 percent, the biggest intraday drop in more than two years, on the news. They were down 6.4 percent at $48.75 at 3:30 p.m. in New York.  Apple could still theoretically abandon or delay the switch. The company declined to comment. Intel said, \u201cWe don\u2019t comment on speculation about our customers.\u201d  For Apple, the change would be a defining moment. Intel chips remain some of the only major processor components designed by others inside Apple\u2019s product portfolio. Currently, all iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches, and Apple TVs use main processors designed by Apple and based on technology from Arm Holdings Plc. Moving to its own chips inside Macs would let Apple release new models on its own timelines, instead of relying on Intel\u2019s processor roadmap.  \u201cWe think that Apple is looking at ways to further integrate their hardware and software platforms, and they\u2019ve clearly made some moves in this space, trying to integrate iOS and macOS,\u201d said Shannon Cross, an analyst at Cross Research. \u201cIt makes sense that they\u2019re going in this direction. If you look at incremental R&D spend, it\u2019s gone into ways to try to vertically integrate their components so they can add more functionality for competitive differentiation.\u201d  Stand Out  The shift would also allow Cupertino, California-based Apple to more quickly bring new features to all of its products and stand out from the competition. Using its own main chips would make Apple the only major PC maker to use its own processors. Dell Technologies Inc., HP Inc., Lenovo Group Ltd., and Asustek Computer Inc. use Intel chips.  By using its own chips, Apple would be able to more tightly integrate new hardware and software, potentially resulting in systems with better battery life -- similar to iPads, which use Apple chips.  While the transition to Apple chips in hardware is planned to begin as early as 2020, the changes to the software side will begin even before that. Apple\u2019s iPhones and iPads with custom chips use the iOS operating system, while Mac computers with Intel chips run on a different system called macOS. Apple has slowly been integrating user-facing features over the past several years, and more recently starting sharing lower-level features like a new file management system.  \u2018Marzipan\u2019 Platform  As part of the larger initiative to make Macs work more like iPhones, Apple is working on a new software platform, internally dubbed Marzipan, for release as early as this year that would allow users to run iPhone and iPad apps on Macs, Bloomberg News reported last year.  The company has also previously released Macs with ARM-based co-processors, which run an iOS-like operating system, for specific functions like security. The latest MacBook Pro and iMac Pro include the co-processors. Apple plans to add that chip to a new version of its Mac Pro, to be released by next year, and new Mac laptops this year, according to a person familiar with the matter.  Intel has dominated computing processors for more than a decade, taking market share from Advanced Micro Devices Inc., its only rival in the market. Intel also designs and builds modem chips for some iPhone models so that they can connect to cellular networks and make calls. While Apple is down the list of computer sellers by unit shipments, it\u2019s third when measured by revenue last year, highlighting the premium status of its products.  Apple\u2019s decision to switch away from Intel in PC\u2019s wouldn\u2019t have a major impact on the chipmaker\u2019s earnings because sales to the iPhone maker only constitute a small amount of its total, said Kevin Cassidy, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. A bigger concern would be if this represents part of a wider trend of big customers moving to designing their own components, he said.  In 2005, Apple announced a move to Intel chips in its Macs, an initiative that put former Intel Chief Executive Officer Paul Ottelini on stage with Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. It was a partnership that shook up the PC industry and saw Apple shift away from chips co-developed by IBM and Motorola.  Apple\u2019s current chip designs made their name in thin and light mobile devices. That would indicate Apple will start the transition with laptops before moving the designs into more demanding desktop models. Apple has to walk the fine line of moving away from Intel chips without sacrificing the speed and capabilities of its Macs.  A decision to go with ARM technology in computers might lend it credibility where it has failed to gain a foothold so far. Qualcomm Inc., the biggest mobile phone chip provider, is working with PC makers to introduce new thin and light laptops based on its chips in another attempt to steal share from Intel. Microsoft Corp. is supporting that effort by providing a version of its Windows operating system for ARM technology-based chips.  Intel\u2019s dominance of the market has been based on its ability to use leading manufacturing technology to produce processors that are more powerful than those of its competitors. Its would-be rivals haven\u2019t yet produced designs that have displaced Intel\u2019s products when it comes to crunching data quickly.  Apple\u2019s custom processors have been recently manufactured principally by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Ltd. Its decision may signal confidence that TSMC and other suppliers such as Samsung Electronics Co. have closed the gap on Intel\u2019s manufacturing lead and can produce processors that are just as powerful.", "stock": "INTC", "label": -1, "date": "2018-04-02", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-02/apple-is-said-to-plan-move-from-intel-to-own-mac-chips-from-2020"}, {"article": "Intel Corp., whose microprocessors dominate the personal-computer market, gave an upbeat quarterly and annual sales forecast, signaling optimism that demand will persist even as the industry scrambles to fix vulnerabilities in its PC and server chips.  Sales in the current period will be about $15 billion, plus or minus $500 million, and annual revenue will rise to a record $65 billion, the company said in a statement late Thursday. The projections exceed analysts\u2019 estimates.  Intel shares gained 6 percent in pre-market trading at 6:04 a.m. in New York Friday, after closing at $45.30. The stock rose 27 percent in 2017, lagging behind the 38 percent advance in the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index. The benchmark has outpaced Intel so far this year, too.  Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich is trying to remake Intel into a more general provider of chips, expanding into new markets such as self-driving cars and industrial systems. While those efforts helped, it was a 20 percent sales jump in its data-center chip business that really powered the quarter -- and will determine success for the foreseeable future.  Intel repeated its assertion that chip flaws known as Meltdown and Spectre won\u2019t have a material impact on its finances. Forecasts didn\u2019t budge after the potential exploits were made public in early January. Krzanich said Intel has made progress on patching exposed computer systems, but said he\u2019s \"acutely aware that we have more to do.\u201d  The chipmaker\u2019s outlook indicates that corporations are spending on infrastructure, a good sign for earnings reports by companies such as Microsoft Corp., Kim Forrest, an analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group, which owns Intel shares.  \"They look really good,\u201d she said. \u201cEven the data center came back.\u201d  In the fourth quarter, sales climbed 4.3 percent to $17.1 billion, Intel said. The company posted a net loss of 15 cents a share because of an income tax expense of $5.4 billion, a result of the new U.S. tax law passed last month. Excluding certain items, profit was $1.08 a share. On that basis, analysts had projected 87 cents in profit, on revenue of $16.4 billion.  Intel Chief Financial Officer Bob Swan said the boost in Intel\u2019s sales and profit in the recent quarter came from a return to spending by corporations on their internal networks. That trend may not continue, he said. Sales to cloud-service providers -- companies such as Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and Amazon.com Inc. -- rose 35 percent in the fourth quarter.  \u201cWe see good demand trends\u201d in the first quarter, Swan said in an interview. \u201cThe biggest pleasant surprise was enterprise.\u201d  After it announced the vulnerabilities Jan. 3, Intel said its chips were not faulty -- they work as promised -- noting that the potential exploits affect all modern processors, not just Intel products. It then accepted more responsibility, apologized and began submitting regular updates on efforts to roll out software patches that close security holes. While there have been no reports of data being stolen via these methods, some of the patches have caused computers to repeatedly reboot or slow down, particularly older machines.  Intel\u2019s PC chip unit had fourth-quarter sales of $9 billion, down 2 percent from a year earlier. Santa Clara, California-based Intel is facing a revived challenge in the PC market from longtime rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc.  The data-center unit, which sells powerful, expensive chips for machines that run the internet and corporate networks, had revenue of $5.6 billion, up 20 percent. Intel\u2019s CEO has promised long-term growth in that unit of more than 10 percent, though gains in recent quarters had fallen short of that target. In the third quarter, data-center division sales rose just 7 percent.  Sales of memory chips rose 9 percent, while revenue from chips for a new range of devices that are gaining the ability to compute and connect, known as the internet of things, climbed 21 percent.  Intel\u2019s renewed commitment to memory chips takes it into direct competition with Samsung Electronics Co., the only company in the industry with comparable sales and manufacturing resources.  Intel invented the memory market when the company was founded in the late 1960s. It got out of the business in the early 1990s when competition from Asian companies became too great. This is typically the most volatile part of the chip industry. In some years, producers lose money when supply gluts cause prices to drop. Intel\u2019s latest memory chip foray made money in the fourth quarter, and the company expects it to remain profitable throughout 2018.  While overall performance has been strong by Intel, there are challenges ahead. For one, the company may not have generated enough sales to maintain its 25-year run as the world\u2019s largest chipmaker.

This year\u2019s bacchanal was crammed with drones, self-driving cars, and internet-connected toilet seats\u2014and the opening keynote speech was stranger than any of that. On Jan. 8, 5,000 ticket holders made their way through a sea of hired models and ultra-high-definition TVs to the Monte Carlo Resort and Casino on the Strip, where they squeezed into a theater to watch a two-hour psychedelic variety show. The opening act, a Blue Man Group-style quartet called Algorithm \u2019n Blues, pantomimed a performance of Human by the Killers, backed up by a digital bassist on a giant LCD screen, flying drones that played keys on a giant piano, and a trio of acrobats, dressed like extras from Tron, who performed a trampoline routine.

Former NFL quarterback Tony Romo appeared onstage to talk up Intel\u2019s work in 3D video, and Krzanich showed off a full-size pilotless helicopter before capping the evening by suggesting they head outside to see a light show over the famous Bellagio fountains involving hundreds of drones\u2014all, of course, either made by Intel or running on Intel chips.  CEO Krzanich holds Intel\u2019s latest drone, the Shooting Star Mini, as he speaks at CES in Las Vegas on Jan. 8. Photographer: Rick Wilking/Reuters  The whole thing was a dizzying reminder that although Intel isn\u2019t the household name it was during the PC boom of the 1990s, it can still put on a show. The company makes about 90 percent of the world\u2019s computer processors and 99 percent of the server chips in the data centers that effectively run the internet. While the world\u2019s largest chipmaker has struggled to expand beyond those core businesses, it reported $60 billion in 2017 revenue at a gross margin of 63 percent, an unimaginable profit for most factory owners.  What made the Intel keynote so surreal was that Krzanich barely mentioned the potentially catastrophic news that was on everyone\u2019s mind. The previous week, the Register, a British technology journal, reported that independent researchers had discovered flaws in Intel\u2019s chip designs that hackers could exploit to steal data thought to be the most secure. These vulnerabilities, known as Meltdown and Spectre, are a very, very big deal, allowing hackers to peek at the part of the computer where companies and individuals store passwords, encryption keys, and most anything sensitive. The flaws are unprecedented. Every PC, every smartphone, and every server in the world is exposed. The episode has already led to lawsuits and calls for investigations, and undermines more than a decade of Intel\u2019s technical wizardry.  For the past few years, major cloud providers have sought ways to reduce their dependence on Intel\u2019s server chip monopoly, quietly developing their own models or funding nascent competitors. And just days before Krzanich took the stage in Vegas, Intel gave those companies\u2014and everybody else\u2014a massive incentive to accelerate those efforts.  Even the researchers who discovered Meltdown and Spectre initially didn\u2019t believe what they were seeing. \u201cThat would have been such a major f--- -up by Intel that it can\u2019t be possible,\u201d researcher Michael Schwarz recalls thinking. Spectre affects all modern chips, including those made by competitors, but the easier hack, Meltdown, applies almost exclusively to chips made by Intel.  The flaws can be patched, but those patches could slow the Intel chips by as much as 30 percent, the equivalent of turning a state-of-the-art server chip into one from 2013. \u201cThere is no playbook for something like this,\u201d says Charles Carmakal, a vice president at Mandiant, the arm of security company FireEye that consults on high-profile hacks. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen a vulnerability that worked across so many different operating systems and devices.\u201d  If the slowdown turns out to be anywhere near as bad as some think it could be, it\u2019ll amount to a major price increase for data center owners, who could in turn demand that Intel cover the cost. (So far, the big cloud providers have said their customers won\u2019t be affected. Their plans, and the costs, remain unclear.) And because Intel is so reliant on chip revenue, there\u2019d be no easy way to make up those losses. Intel\u2019s stock is down 5 percent since the Register report; shares of Advanced Micro Devices Inc., its only real competitor for PC and server chips, are up 11 percent.  During the six months Intel was quietly working to try to fix the vulnerabilities, Krzanich sold $24 million in company shares. Intel says the stock sale was part of a plan that had been in place before anyone there knew about Meltdown or Spectre, but the day after Krzanich\u2019s CES speech, two U.S. senators sent letters to the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice demanding investigations. Consumer and shareholder lawyers have filed a dozen class actions against Intel, and there are few signs the pressure will let up on Krzanich anytime soon. In a research note, an analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. called the stock sale \u201cindefensible.\u201d  \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen a vulnerability that worked across so many different operating systems and devices\u201d  Intel, which declined to make Krzanich available for comment, has treated Meltdown and Spectre as something close to a nonstory. In its initial statement, issued on Jan. 3, the company disputed that Spectre and Meltdown represented \u201cflaws,\u201d describing them as merely a new field of \u201cresearch\u201d into an industrywide phenomenon. It said any slowdowns would be minimal, close to zero for most people, and that the episode would have no impact on Intel\u2019s business. At CES, after Algorithm \u2019n Blues but before Romo, Krzanich briefly addressed the not-flaw by thanking Intel\u2019s peers for \u201ccoming together\u201d to \u201caddress the recent security findings.\u201d  Intel\u2019s clients, including the biggest companies in the technology industry, have mostly kept quiet. They have no alternative supplier. Privately, some are seething. The day after Krzanich\u2019s big show, Microsoft Corp. published a blog post disputing Intel\u2019s earlier assertion that users wouldn\u2019t notice the slowdowns. Navin Shenoy, an Intel executive vice president, said in a statement that customer security is \u201ca critical priority\u201d for the company. In private conversations with clients, Intel\u2019s top managers haven\u2019t always acted that way, treating a disaster that threatens the security of every computer user and the profits of a whole category of businesses as no big deal, according to an executive at one of Intel\u2019s large customers. The potential fallout isn\u2019t an academic concern, the executive says, \u201cit\u2019s f---ing scary.\u201d  Part of what makes Meltdown and Spectre so terrifying is that they upend more than a decade of conventional wisdom about information security. Starting in the mid-2000s, Intel added a layer of security within its chips and began encouraging developers to store users\u2019 most sensitive information in the walled-off area rather than in regular software memory. Only about two years ago did researchers first notice, and begin trying to crack, a feature called speculative execution that Intel uses to speed up its chips. It essentially allows a chip to access any data it guesses a user is about to ask for, even if it\u2019s inside the secure area, before checking whether the user is allowed to access it. This is a big reason computers and smartphones have kept getting faster year after year. It also left a gaping security hole.  The feature\u2019s vulnerabilities were discussed at conferences and in academic papers but were considered merely theoretical until last spring, when Jann Horn, a 22-year-old researcher in Google\u2019s elite cybersecurity division, succeeded in reading private data from the secure area. Horn informed Intel in June, beating out three other research teams that discovered the flaw later in 2017. Together, they began working with Intel to patch the flaws; until the Register report, they\u2019d planned to disclose their findings on Jan. 9. As Google pointed out in a blog post about the discovery, the security flaws could allow a cloud user to covertly snoop on another customer\u2019s machine. Anyone with an Amazon Web Services account could, in theory, steal another AWS user\u2019s login data and access their files, though that would often require physical access to the target machine.  In interviews, Intel executives dispute suggestions that the company\u2019s focus on chip speeds led it to overlook obvious vulnerabilities. Intel says it\u2019s already provided software fixes for 90 percent of its chips and that this is nothing out of the ordinary. \u201cWe have an ongoing process to make our products better,\u201d says Stephen Smith, general manager of the company\u2019s data center group. \u201cWe just happen to be doing it under a spotlight now.\u201d At CES, Krzanich told the crowd that \u201cas of now\u201d Intel had \u201cnot received any information that these exploits have been used to obtain customer data.\u201d  This sounds more comforting than it probably should. Security analysts say that if four groups of researchers independently figured out the exploits, then some number of governments with sophisticated cyberweapons programs (China, Russia, the U.S.) likely did, too. An intelligence agency armed with Spectre or Meltdown would likely aim big, according to Mandiant\u2019s Carmakal. \u201cA government wouldn\u2019t use this to break into Target,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019d use it to get into the Department of Defense.\u201d  So far, Meltdown and Spectre probably pose less risk to the average person than, say, a simple phishing attack in which a hacker tries to send you to a malicious website. They won\u2019t lead to the kind of widespread panic that resulted from the 2017 hack of Equifax\u2019s customer database.  But that could change. Hackers who hadn\u2019t tried to break into Intel\u2019s hardware, believing there was no way it would leave a side door open, are now seeking ways in. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be looking for other things like this,\u201d says Jeff Pollard, an analyst with the research firm Forrester. \u201cThis is a new kind of attack. This is going to linger.\u201d  And long-term fixes won\u2019t be easy. While coders can pull a few all-nighters to close holes in software, a chip takes years to design, test, and mass-produce. Each model can cost tens of millions of dollars to develop. For now, computer owners and data center operators will have to make an unsavory choice: Use Intel\u2019s software patches and accept slower speeds, or skip the patches and remain at risk. (Intel has already said patches are causing some machines to reboot more often than usual.) Future designs will include hard-wired fixes that speed things up, but the first versions of those won\u2019t appear until later this year, the company says.  All of this puts Intel in a tough spot. The company is a nonfactor in the smartphone-chips business dominated by Samsung, Qualcomm, and ARM, and rival Nvidia has taken a commanding lead in the fast-growing market for graphics chips used in artificial intelligence applications. Now, Meltdown and Spectre threaten the core of Intel\u2019s business. The company has no competitor in server chips at the moment, but this episode could change that. Microsoft and Google have publicly praised Qualcomm Inc.\u2019s first server chip, which went on sale in November, and Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook all have internal divisions working on chip designs.  Intel\u2019s more immediate threat is political. It\u2019ll almost certainly have to withstand criticism from lawmakers at a time when governments around the world are increasingly skeptical of tech companies with de facto monopolies. \u201cThis hyper-dependence on one chipmaker, indeed one technology, although billed as a way to lower prices, has had the effect also of greatly increasing society\u2019s exposure not only to hackers but also to \u2018shock events\u2019 that disrupt entire systems,\u201d the Open Markets Institute, a Washington think tank that advocates for controls on market concentration, wrote in its weekly newsletter on Jan. 11. For now, Intel\u2019s big problem is Krzanich\u2019s stock sales, but if it becomes clear that customers have been harmed by hacking or higher costs, regulators will likely seek recourse through consumer protection suits, antitrust investigations, or both.  Intel has faced this kind of public pressure before. In 1994 the company was heavily criticized for trying to ignore evidence that its Pentium chips were generating errors for certain obscure calculations. The crisis caused IBM to announce that it would no longer ship machines that used the flawed chips. Intel\u2019s meticulously constructed brand, Intel Inside, which had served as a sort of Good Housekeeping Seal for computer buyers, suddenly looked questionable. As part of Intel\u2019s extensive mea culpa, then-CEO Andy Grove offered to replace all the buggy chips and took an inventory writedown of $475 million, about half its annual R&D budget at the time.  Grove\u2019s lesson, as he recounted in his business-advice book Only the Paranoid Survive, was that Intel had been caught out. Even a quarter-century into its existence, the massive company still saw itself as a scrappy tech startup. With its size and influence, he acknowledged, came new responsibilities. \u201cThe trouble was,\u201d Grove wrote, \u201cnot only didn\u2019t we realize that the rules had changed, but what was worse, we didn\u2019t know what rules we now had to abide by.\u201d  Intel has been the top chipmaker for the past 25 years, but Meltdown and Spectre could turn out to be much worse than the Pentium bug. If the company wants to maintain its position, it\u2019ll need real humility, not cheap theatrics.  \u2014With Dina Bass, Mark Bergen, Alex Webb, and Dune Lawrence", "stock": "INTC", "label": 1, "date": "2018-01-20", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-01-18/intel-has-a-big-problem-it-needs-to-act-like-it"}, {"article": "Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Intel Corp.\u2019s main rival in computer microprocessors, said a report earlier this month alleging that its chips have widespread, fundamental vulnerabilities greatly exaggerated the severity of the threat.  There are 13 potential exploits that will be fixed within weeks through software updates, the chipmaker said Tuesday in a statement. There\u2019s no evidence that of any of those holes has been used for malevolent purposes, and it would be extremely difficult to use any of them to attack computers, the Sunnyvale, California-based company said. AMD saw reports of unusual trading activity in its stock about a week ago when an Israeli company called CTS Labs went public with a report on the flaws and has reported it to the relevant authorities.  The chip industry was stung at the beginning of the year when Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google revealed that a flaw in all modern microprocessors may allow hackers to steal data such as passwords or encryption keys previously thought to be secure. AMD argued at the time that its chips were less at risk than those from Intel, which dominates the market for computer microprocessors.  \u201cIt\u2019s important to note that all the issues raised in the research require administrative access to the system, a type of access that effectively grants the user unrestricted access to the system,\u201d AMD Chief Technology Officer Mark Papermaster said in the statement, referring to the recent report. \u201cAny attacker gaining unauthorized administrative access would have a wide range of attacks at their disposal well beyond the exploits identified in this research.\u201d  The issue isn\u2019t related to the vulnerabilities Google identified in January and isn\u2019t caused by AMD\u2019s Zen architecture, a new design that underpins all of its new chips, AMD said in its statement. The chipmaker said that, unlike the more widespread Spectre and Meltdown issues identified in January, software fixes for the currently discovered vulnerabilities won\u2019t slow down computers.  On March 12, CTS Labs contacted AMD about the potential exploits. Then the firm went public 24 hours later with its report, according to AMD.  \u201cThe vulnerabilities we have discovered allow bad actors who infiltrated the network to persist in it, surviving computer reboots and re-installations of the operating system, while remaining virtually undetectable by most endpoint security solutions,\u201d CTS said in the report. \u201cThis allows attackers to engage in persistent virtually undetectable espionage, buried deep in the system and executed from AMD\u2019s Secure Processor and chipset.\u201d  CTS estimated that it would take \u201cmany months\u201d to address the issue. The researcher didn\u2019t give AMD that amount of time to fix the holes before drawing public attention to them, something that goes against standard practice in these situations.  \u201cI fault CTS Labs for not following industry-standard coordinated disclosure procedure,\u201d said Ben Gras, a researcher at Vrije University in Amsterdam who focuses on hardware security flaws. \u201cA widely accepted practice in these situations is to coordinate with the vendor and affected parties during a window of confidentiality before publicizing security sensitive information, reducing the impact of the research while still maintaining transparency. As it stands, this leads me to believe they are not acting in good faith, and make me interpret other aspects of this report skeptically.\u201d  On Wednesday, CTS said it disagreed with AMD\u2019s assessment of the risks posed by the weaknesses and the time frame for patching them. \"Our view is that AMD is attempting to downplay the significance of its vulnerabilities,\" CTS said in a statement.  \u2014 With assistance by Jeremy Kahn, and Gwen Ackerman", "stock": "INTC", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-20", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-20/amd-confirms-chip-vulnerability-says-report-exaggerated-danger"}, {"article": "Music-streaming service Spotify Technology SA has avoided the traditional path to a stock listing, eschewing costly investment bankers and saying it wants to price its shares at a level that will ensure stability rather than a big jump on the first day of trading.

How Apple Built a Chip Powerhouse to Threaten Qualcomm and Intel  The company already makes many of the chips for its iPhones, iPads, Macs and Watches. By Mark Gurman January 29, 2018 By Mark Gurman  For several years, Apple has been steadily designing more and more of the chips powering its iPhones, iPads, Macs and Apple Watches. This creates a better user experience and helps trump rivals. Recently the company got a fresh incentive to go all-in on silicon: revelations that microprocessors with components designed by Intel Corp., Arm Holdings Plc and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. are vulnerable to hacking. Steve Jobs long believed Apple should own the technologies inside its products rather than rely on mashups of components from other chip makers, including Samsung, Intel and Imagination Technologies. In 2008, the company made a small but significant step in that direction by acquiring boutique chip maker P.A. Semi. Two years later, Jobs unveiled the iPad. The world focused on the tablet\u2019s giant touchscreen, book-reading prowess and creativity apps. But the most ground-breaking technology was hidden away inside: the A4, Apple\u2019s first processor designed in-house. That original \u201csystem-on-a-chip\u201d has since been succeeded by increasingly powerful processors. Today, Apple packs its devices with custom components that process artificial intelligence tasks, track your steps, power game graphics, secure Face ID or Touch ID data, run the Apple Watch, pair AirPods to your phone and help make Macs work the way they do. The result: a chip powerhouse that could one day threaten the dominance of Qualcomm Inc. and even, eventually, Intel.

Apple declined to comment. Apple isn\u2019t the first company to create its own chips in-house. It\u2019s just the most successful. HP Inc., Motorola, International Business Machines Corp. and Koninklijke Philips NV all had chip divisions at one time or another. Those ultimately failed or stumbled because chip-making is the sport of kings: It\u2019s brutally expensive and requires massive scale. Apple has wisely focused on designing its silicon (for its system on a chips, Apple uses reference designs from Arm Holdings Plc). Manufacturing is left to others, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Apple\u2019s push into the complicated and pricey chips business makes sense so long as the company is selling 300 million devices a year. And it's not as though the entrenched players are going anywhere. Qualcomm is investing in next-generation 5G networks, several companies are making AI chips and Intel is pushing mobile processors. Meanwhile, Samsung, Apple's arch rival, is a major chip manufacturer in its own right. Apple has chip-building and testing facilities in unmarked buildings in and around hometown Cupertino, California, and in Herzliya, Israel, a hotbed of new technologies. The operation employs hundreds of people and is run by Johny Srouji, who joined Apple in 2008 after stints at Intel and IBM and has likened his chip architects to \u201cartists.\u201d In recent months, Srouji has been poaching more and more modem engineers from Qualcomm. The chipmaker builds iPhone modems but is engaged in a legal battle with Apple over licensing fees Qualcomm charges smartphone makers. Hiring Qualcomm people could mean Apple plans to eventually create its own modems, which connect phones to cellular networks. For now, Apple is considering using Intel and MediaTek Inc. exclusively for modems in this year\u2019s iPhone lineup, Bloomberg News reported last year.

The new iPad, due to be released toward the end of the year, will probably also include the Apple-designed graphics engine and AI chip.

The engineer\u2019s private airfield is nestled in a valley on the Northern California coast between Monterey and Santa Barbara, and it\u2019s remote by design, out past a swirl of tan and green fields. Bevirt, a 44-year-old whose bursts of childlike delight punctuate his otherwise quiet intensity, bounds out to greet the chopper, then points the arriving pair of reporters to the prototype resting on the dirt runway nearby. It\u2019s an exotic-looking white aircraft with numerous propellers. (Bevirt agreed to the visit only on the condition that physical specifics remain unpublished.) He calls it an air taxi. \u201cThis is what I have been dreaming about for 40 years,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the culmination of my life\u2019s work.\u201d  Bevirt is the founder and chief executive officer of Joby Aviation Inc., a startup that\u2019s spent the past nine years trying to design and build a whole new kind of short-hop aircraft. Believe it or not, things have been going well. We were the first two reporters to see a demo of the prototype, named Rachel after the women several of its creators used to date. The pilot managed a vertical takeoff, 15 minutes of flight in a 15-mile loop, and a safe landing. Powered by electric motors and sophisticated control software, the taxi performs like a cross between a drone and a small plane, able to zip straight up on takeoff and then fly at twice the speed of a helicopter while making about as much noise as a swarm of superbees. Bevirt says thousands of these sky cabs will one day shuttle people around cities, soaring above the conventional traffic below.  Broken promises of flying cars predate The Jetsons, but Bevirt has made believers out of people with deep pockets. On Feb. 1, Joby Aviation announced a fresh $100 million in venture funding, more than three times the capital it had raised before, from investors including Intel Capital, Toyota AI Ventures, JetBlue Technology Ventures, and Capricorn Investment Group, a prominent backer of Tesla and Space Exploration Technologies. \u201cThere are a lot of dreamers in this space, but we have done a lot of research here, and JoeBen has absolutely nailed the right time for it,\u201d says Bonny Simi, president of JetBlue\u2019s investment arm.  Thanks to advances in electric motors, batteries, software, and other components, the field of flying cars, air taxis, or whatever you want to call them (Sky Segways?) is a lot more crowded than it was even a couple of years ago. Larry Page, the CEO of Google parent Alphabet Inc., has pumped tens of millions of dollars into startups Kitty Hawk and Zee.Aero. A dozen other startups around the world have similar projects at various stages of design, as do Airbus SE and Boeing Co. Even Uber Technologies Inc. claims to be working on an air taxi service, tentatively called Uber Elevate. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to happen within the next 10 years,\u201d Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said during a Jan. 22 speech at a tech conference in Munich.  Bevirt\u2019s secrecy extends to the environs of Joby\u2019s camouflaged lair: The trailers that serve as his engineers\u2019 flight-control centers are covered in posters warning them about the area\u2019s mountain lions, snakes, spiders, and other deadly fauna. Bevirt does say Joby intends to build an aircraft that will hold four passengers and a pilot and will travel at least 150 miles on a single charge at an altitude of a few thousand feet or less. (That would mean the cabin wouldn\u2019t need to be pressurized.) \u201cAnother goal is to be 100 times more quiet during takeoff and landing than a helicopter and near-silent during flyovers,\u201d says Joby Executive Chairman Paul Sciarra, a co-founder of Pinterest, the image-centric wish list site.  All told, Joby\u2019s venture funding totals about $130 million  A trained mechanical engineer and sci-fi nerd, Bevirt made a fortune selling bendable tripods and other camera accessories more than a decade ago. He\u2019s poured that money into his aviation startup. A couple of years back, he had 35 people working on various prototype craft; now he has 120, most of them working far from the airfield at his 500-acre ranch in Santa Cruz. There, engineers make just about every part of the air taxi prototype, from the body and motors to the flight-control software.  Joby says it plans to mass-produce its air taxis for a ride-hailing service that it will operate. Bevirt\u2019s vision includes a landing pad for every office and cul-de-sac. Each trip, he says, will cost about as much as an Uber or Lyft ride does today, and eventually the air taxis will be fully autonomous. \u201cOur mission is to save a billion people an hour a day,\u201d he says. He\u2019s less confident about a rollout date, partly because the formidable challenges ahead include convincing politicians, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the cab-hailing public that air taxis are safe. \u201cWe are well into the design and build of the production vehicle\u201d was the most he\u2019d say on the subject of time to market.  While a whiff of the surreal hangs over Bevirt\u2019s claims that he\u2019ll \u201cchange people\u2019s relationship with aircraft,\u201d some of his investors are counting on it. JetBlue\u2019s Simi says she sees Joby as part of a broader shift in the aerospace industry, a way to make more personal forms of air travel a part of daily life. JetBlue has also invested in Zunum Aero, which is building an electric jet that can fly dozens of people 1,000 miles. And though Intel owns a stake in a German air taxi startup called Volocopter GmbH, Wendell Brooks, president of Intel Capital, says Joby \u201cis very far ahead relative to all the other things we\u2019ve seen.\u201d  For more on flying cars, check out the Decrypted podcast:  For more on the future of transportation, go to Bloomberg.com/hyperdrive", "stock": "INTC", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-01", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-01/air-taxi-startup-joby-has-a-working-prototype-and-a-fresh-100m"}, {"article": "Value of China\u2019s yearly chip imports dwarfs that of crude oil  China\u2019s aspiration to deploy 30 million autonomous vehicles within a decade is seeding a fledgling chip industry, with startups like Horizon Robotics Inc. emerging to build the brains behind those wheels.  The Beijing-based company is taking aim at Nvidia Corp. and Mobileye NV just as the autonomous-driving business takes off and uncertainty looms over international trade. Annual revenue from the chips used in driverless vehicles globally should more than double to $5 billion by 2021, according to Gartner Inc.  A screen shows a demonstration of the cognition level of Horizon Robotics\u2019 Journey processor. Photographer: Giulia Marchi/Bloomberg  Horizon Robotics is an example of China\u2019s resolve to move up the manufacturing value chain by focusing less on commodity smartphones and TVs, and more on sophisticated semiconductors and artificial intelligence that can help cars drive themselves or spaceships land on the moon. That industrial policy is meant to help China reduce its 1.75 trillion yuan ($276.4 billion) in annual chip imports, a value dwarfing its oil imports.  \u201cChina has to spare no efforts to pick up and develop its own chip technology to improve our own sense of security, especially when the U.S. government is making us fearful about any protectionism against China,\u201d Wei Shaojun, director of the Beijing-based Institute of Microelectronics at Tsinghua University, said at a forum in Shanghai.  A Horizon Robotics processor sits onboard a vehicle. Photographer: Giulia Marchi/Bloomberg  China\u2019s push for self-reliance is a priority for President Xi Jinping\u2019s administration, which set up a 200 billion-yuan fund for investments in homegrown chipmakers, Bloomberg News reported.  Overseers of the world\u2019s largest car market -- and electric-vehicle market -- want to put Chinese-developed chips under those hoods and behind those dashboards. The government expects to have a manufacturing industry for parts such as sensors and embedded chips with a production value exceeding 100 billion yuan by 2020.  More Chips in Your Tesla Market for sophisticated semiconductors set to boom as cars get more features Source: Gartner, Bloomberg Intelligence  \u201cEveryone is on the same starting line, thus creating an opportunity for China,\u201d said Ding Wenwu, president of the state-backed China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund Co.  Horizon Robotics was founded in 2015 by Yu Kai, the former head of Baidu Inc.\u2019s artificial-intelligence business called the Institute of Deep Learning. Its investors include Intel Capital Corp., Shanghai-based Harvest Fund Management Co., Russian billionaire Yuri Milner and state-owned China Jianyin Investment Ltd.  The company completed a $100 million funding round in December.  Horizon\u2019s smaller-than-a-postage stamp circuit board is called \u201cJourney 1.0,\u201d which was showcased inside a General Motors Co. GMC Yukon XL at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January. The processor can detect as many as 200 targets -- including pedestrians, vehicles and lane markings -- in real time and help the driverless car avoid collisions.  \u201cChinese companies have been evolving from the positions of made-in-China to created-in-China,\u201d said Yu, 42. \u201cAnd now we are heading to invented-in-China.\u201d  The company is cooperating with Volkswagen AG\u2019s Audi; Chongqing Changan Automobile Co., the local partner of Ford Motor Co.; and parts supplier Robert Bosch GmbH to get inside future autonomous vehicles.

Photographer: Giulia Marchi/Bloomberg  In an industry where the number of LEDs in a brake light is scrutinized for impact on gas mileage, processing data from laser, radar and camera sensors without draining an electric battery poses an enormous challenge for chipmakers.  \u201cWhat we are seeking is a horse that can run fast and long but eats as little as possible,\u201d Yu said. \u201cIf the embedded vehicle chip consumes too much power, it will lead to a burning car rather than a running car.\u201d  Audi selected Horizon Robotics for a China-specific project and will evaluate the outcome before taking any next steps, Johanna Barth, a Beijing-based spokeswoman for Audi, said without elaborating.  Audi still uses Nvidia and Mobileye sensors in cars sold outside China, she said.  Nvidia, based in Santa Clara, California, has recorded revenue growth of more than 20 percent for the last seven quarters, partly because of increasing demand for autonomous vehicles. It teamed with Baidu to develop an autonomous-vehicle platform, with plans to install that in cars made by Chery Automobile Co.  \u201cWe are working with Chinese automakers and the Chinese ecosystem, as well as global automakers that sell vehicles in China,\u201d said Danny Shapiro, senior director of automotive at Nvidia.  One of those customers is Tusimple Inc., a Beijing-based startup developing self-driving trucks. Tusimple, set to start commercial operation of truck fleets in Arizona and Shanghai next year, is backed by investors including Nvidia.  \u201cWe are satisfied with Nvidia\u2019s chip, which has the strongest computing power for self-driving solutions,\u201d said Hou Xiaodi, Tusimple\u2019s chief technology officer.  Jerusalem-based Mobileye, bought by Intel last year for $15 billion, provides image sensing and processing technology for driver-assistance features. It wants to expand in China through its fourth-generation EyeQ chip and a mapping system called Road Experience Management, said Danielle Mann, a spokeswoman for Intel.  Mobileye will bring the mapping system to China via partnerships with SAIC Motor Corp. and Beijing-based digital map provider NavInfo Co.  Yet, China has the money and commitment to make itself a force in semiconductor development, just as it\u2019s doing now with electric vehicles.  China\u2019s industrial priorities include becoming a leader in advanced manufacturing businesses, including integrated circuits, 5G mobile communications, aircraft engines and new-energy vehicles, Premier Li Keqiang told the National People\u2019s Congress on March 5.  The government envisions spending about $150 billion in the next decade.  \u201cAll major governments around the world are deploying all kinds of resources in policies, talents and capital to upgrade their industries,\u201d Tsinghua University\u2019s Wei said. \u201cAnd China is no exception.\u201d  \u2014 With assistance by Yan Zhang, Ian King, Yuan Gao, and Ville Heiskanen", "stock": "INTC", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-25", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-25/china-seeks-its-own-brains-to-steer-30-million-autonomous-cars"}, {"article": "Car2Go and DriveNow were both originally started as ventures with established vehicle-rental companies, but Stuttgart-based Daimler and Munich-based BMW each bought out the other owners this year, setting the stage for a tie-up.

The companies will form a 50-50 joint venture to include Daimler\u2019s Car2Go and BMW\u2019s DriveNow businesses as well as services including smartphone apps for calling taxis, locating parking spots and recharging electric autos, they said in a joint statement. Both carmakers raised full-year profit forecasts, saying earnings are likely to increase slightly if they can complete the deal in 2018, versus earlier predictions of flat figures.  The merger would allow Daimler and BMW to share the risk of operating in a tech-focused industry that includes a growing suite of rivals in mobility services. They\u2019re entering a rapidly changing environment that in the past week alone included a market and share-swap deal between Uber and Southeast Asian rival Grab, the U.S. company\u2019s struggles with a fatal accident involving a self-driving car test, and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Waymo unit agreeing to develop autonomous vehicles with Britain\u2019s Jaguar Land Rover.

His briefings of Apple breakthroughs over the years were legendary, and featured huge visuals behind him as he paced the stage. He was not just an innovator but also a master communicator. When I had to give addresses back in my military days, I would dive into Carmine Gallo\u2019s \u201cThe Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs\u201d for inspiration.  Watching Russian President Vladimir Putin roll out a similar display of fearsome new weapons at his state of the federation speech the other day had the distinct feeling of watching a Steve Jobs-style brief put together by \"Q,\" the gadget-loving quartermaster from MI6, in a twisted James Bond movie. But this bag of tricks is neither a new iPhone nor an Aston Martin with machine guns, or even an exploding pen. Putin was talking about nuclear weapons moving toward the U.S. on a variety of new platforms. How seriously should we take this?  Let\u2019s put aside that the video's special effects seemed straight from a 1990s video game, and start with the purported weapons themselves. In each case, U.S. intelligence has been tracking the development of these systems over the past decade. There is a nuclear-tipped and nuclear-powered torpedo; a new generation intercontinental ballistic missile with longer ranges; a nuclear-powered cruise missile that could theoretically fly more or less forever and attack the U.S. from any location; an air-launched high-speed cruise missile; and a hypersonic glide missile capable of flying 20 times the speed of sound. He also mentioned new laser systems to deploy against U.S. weapons. He described several of the weapons as \u201cinvincible.\u201d  His motivation in hyping these systems is threefold. First, in the \u201call politics is local\u201d category, he has an election coming up on March 18. While he is predictably and comfortably in the lead in all the polls (fairly easy to do when your opponents are assassinated or jailed and you have complete media control), he still wants to play to his base, as the saying goes. Russians, like people everywhere, enjoy nothing so much as a big spectacle on a huge stage. Add to that a good bashing of Russia\u2019s enemy No. 1, and you have a sure winner.  Second, Putin is communicating with his circle of dictatorial allies and partners around the world. His message to Bashar al-Assad in Syria, Kim Jung Un in North Korea, and the ayatollahs in Iran (can you spell \u201caxis of evil\u201d?) is one of reassurance that someone can stand up to the U.S. in terms of global deterrence and high-end military technology. The demonstration is also a good way to enhance the sales of Russian weapons systems globally -- its producers are currently the second-largest supplier of weapons in the world and would love to surpass the U.S. Indeed, Russia exports as much as Germany, France and the U.K. combined, and triple what China sells globally.  Finally, Putin is sending a very direct signal to Washington. He hates U.S. and Western interference with Russia at any level, from the sanctions over the invasion of Ukraine and annexation of Crimea to the Olympic punishments meted out after the massive doping scandal. The intent here is simple and brutal: We are a nuclear power and can destroy your nation. The fact that the U.S. can do the same to Russia is not lost on Putin, but he will never miss a chance to remind the U.S. that Russia has an equally lethal nuclear arsenal.  In terms of serious military capability, last week's demonstration was a mixed bag. Nothing he displayed represented either a shock to the U.S. intelligence community or a significant change in the existing balance of nuclear and conventional power. Several of the systems have not been demonstrated publically, nor put into serious production. The most worrisome over time is probably the nuclear torpedo, but the idea of a Russian first-strike remains extremely remote. And it is hard to envision a scenario in which the U.S. decides to strike Russia. The odds are extremely high that we will continue along with the same deterrent regime that has kept the nuclear peace since the end of World War II: mutual assured destruction.  In terms of policy issues, Putin's display of braggadocio underscores several important points. First is that stepping up the U.S. conventional force posture in Europe is going to be critical to deterring Russia from using these kinds of weapons to threaten the Europeans. For a start, this means having a full four U.S. brigade combat teams in place and permanently stationed in Europe. We also must continue to push NATO allies to up their game in terms of forces that are combat-ready.  It also emphasizes the importance of avoiding an escalation on both sides, in terms of producing and deploying low-yield nuclear weapons, which could very quickly intensify in a tense scenario and cause Russia to use one of these strategic weapons -- what analysts refer to as the \"escalate to de-escalate\" doctrine. Finally, it will require the Pentagon to develop comparable systems to maintain deterrence, particularly hyper-sonic nuclear-tipped cruise missiles, where Russian progress is outstripping out own.  Another striking aspect of Putin's presentation was his hyper-vitriolic tone, even compared to his previous stridency on such occasions. Given that he will in all likelihood remain Russia's leader for life, we should pay significant attention to the uber-aggressive style of the display. It is hard to imagine any U.S. president in modern history, including even the current incumbent, depicting nuclear attacks on Russia on a large-screen display. It screams of a man desperate for respect, and such men can be very dangerous over time -- especially if they hold a relatively weak overall hand of cards.  And Putin does: Russia has profound demographic problems (also alluded to in Putin\u2019s speech); serious environmental challenges; a struggling economy highly concentrated on hydrocarbons; and few real allies in the world. In many ways, we should worry more about Russian weakness than Russian strength.  For the U.S., the best move with Russia remains simple and transactional: confront where we must (Ukraine, Syria, cyber-intrusions); but cooperate where we can. The latter includes counter-narcotics, counter-piracy, counterterrorism, Afghanistan, the Arctic and other mutual concerns. And there are reasonable \u201cTrack 2\u201d diplomatic options for the nations, such as exchanges between academic institutions, think tanks, laboratories and commercial entities.  We are not quite yet in a new Cold War, but it isn\u2019t hard to see one shimmering in the near distance. Most worrisome of all, U.S. and Russian military forces are in combat in close proximity in Syria, and we are watching our military jets and warships maneuvering at close quarters in the Black and Baltic Seas. We are one significant tactical mistake away from stumbling into real danger. Leaders on both sides need to take a deep breath and encourage their subordinates to do the same.

Government watchdogs are troublesome, but they help when it comes to thwarting a takeover.  Qualcomm Inc. has been stung by governments so often that the fines and scolding barely leave a mark anymore. Now, though, Qualcomm\u2019s government troubles come with a silver lining.  The chipmaker\u2019s latest regulatory run-in was with the European Union\u2019s antitrust body, which fined Qualcomm 997 million euros ($1.2 billion) for paying one of its customers, Apple Inc., to agree to use only Qualcomm\u2019s chips in its iPhones and iPads from 2011 to 2016. The EU antitrust authority said Qualcomm\u2019s arrangement amounted to an improper abuse of market power. Qualcomm said it disagreed with the EU decision and planned to appeal.  It\u2019s a familiar pattern for corporations. Governments tend to wade in when big technology companies become overwhelmingly powerful in their fields. It has happened to Microsoft, Intel and Google to varying degrees. The steely gaze of governments now seems to be turning to Facebook.  The distractions, financial penalties and expensive regulatory and legal skirmishes are the inevitable costs of market power, and Qualcomm knows this well by now. It has clashed with government authorities in South Korea, China, the U.S., and other countries over claims that Qualcomm abuses its dominance in the market for important smartphone components.  When the Chips Are Down Qualcomm's stock is trading below Broadcom's takeover offer of $70 a share, indicating doubts Broadcom can pull off the transaction Source: Bloomberg  Oddly, Qualcomm is now in a position where the government scrutiny helps its cause. Among Qualcomm\u2019s efforts to ward off an unwanted takeover attempt by fellow chipmaker Broadcom Ltd., the company has argued that regulators wouldn\u2019t clear the deal or that regulatory compromises would be too onerous. Yes, on the one hand Qualcomm has been fighting claims that it abuses its market power. And on the other, its size and market power help support Qualcomm's case against a Broadcom takeover.  Qualcomm's concerns are valid. If Broadcom and Qualcomm combine, the company would be the third-largest chipmaker in the world by revenue, behind Intel and Samsung. Broadcom has said that the companies' businesses don't overlap much, but the sheer size would certainly invite regulatory doubts.  And Broadcom has argued -- without much elaboration-- that it will be able to tackle Qualcomm\u2019s continuing government challenges by overhauling Qualcomm\u2019s contentious business model, which generates most of the company's operating profit from licensing patents. Apple and some of the government authorities have said that business model is a way for Qualcomm to overcharge customers.  Flexing Muscles If Broadcom acquires Qualcomm, the combined company would be the world's third-largest chipmaker by revenue Source: Bloomberg  One question is what customers think of the possible creation of an even more hefty chip supplier. The Wall Street Journal reported this month that three leading Chinese smartphone manufacturers are concerned about the Broadcom-Qualcomm deal because they worry a combination would result in higher prices for essential chips. In a rebuttal on Tuesday, Broadcom said that any antitrust concerns could be resolved and that Broadcom\u2019s customers supported an acquisition of Qualcomm.  It can't be fun for Qualcomm (or its stockholders) to see billions of dollars fly out of its coffers to mollify regulators. But Qualcomm must be smiling a little that government watchdogs are also helping the company's case against a takeover.

The results were the first for the company after the disclosure of major security flaws known as Spectre and Meltdown. The flaws have rocked the tech world since Google engineers wrote a detailed description of the flaws on January 3. The vulnerabilities affect every major CPU maker, but Intel has taken the brunt of the impact as its chips are affected more than others.  The flaws are especially worrisome because they were built into Intel's hardware, making fixes to existing chips more challenging, but the company said it would begin shipping chips without the flaws later this year.  \"We've been working around clock,\" Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said. \"We're acutely aware we have more to do.\"  Intel did not detail the potential financial impacts of the flaws in its report, but analysts weren't really expecting the company to.  \"While Meltdown/Spectre could cause purchases to be postponed in 1H, it still too early to tell, and we doubt INTC will guide to such an event for fear of driving a self-fulfilling prophecy,\" John Pitzer, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said before the report.

The guidelines come amid scrutiny of a massive stock sale Intel CEO Brian Krzanich made last fall after his company found out about \u2014 but before it publicly disclosed \u2014 the Meltdown and Spectre attacks.  The agency advised companies to disclose such incidents to investors in a \"timely\" manner.  It also warned executives and directors not to trade in their companies shares in the time in between finding out about a \"material\" security problem and disclosing it to the public.  Intel CEO Brian Krzanich sold millions of dollars worth of company stock after his company became aware of the Spectre and Meltdown security vulnerabilities, but before they became public.  The Securities and Exchange Commission has a bit of advice for other executives thinking of doing something similar: Don't.  In new guidelines issued on Wednesday, the agency warned that security breaches and vulnerabilities could constitute \"material\" information, noting that it's illegal under US securities laws for insiders to trade stocks based on such information before it becomes public. Such sales may also violate companies' ethics and insider trading policies.  \"Directors, officers, and other corporate insiders must not trade a public company's securities while in possession of material nonpublic information, which may include knowledge regarding a significant cybersecurity incident experienced by the company,\" the SEC said in the guidelines.  It continued: \"Companies should have policies and procedures in place to [...] guard against directors, officers, and other corporate insiders taking advantage of the period between the company's discovery of a cybersecurity incident and public disclosure of the incident to trade on material nonpublic information.\"  Additionally, the SEC encouraged companies to disclose security breaches and vulnerabilities to investors in a \"timely fashion.\"  The new guidelines follow disclosures of the Meltdown and Spectre attacks  The guidelines come less than two months after Intel and other tech companies disclosed the Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities. Those vulnerabilities, which take advantage of a feature found in nearly all computer processors, could be used in cyberattacks that would allow malicious actors to steal private data stored on computers, such as passwords.  The exploits were of particular concern to Intel. The vulnerability they take advantage of has been present in nearly all Intel chips for the last 20 years. And while just about all processors found in smartphones, tablets, and PCs are vulnerable to the Spectre attack, few chips other than Intel's are at risk of the Meltdown attack.  Intel was notified of the attacks in June, but waited some seven months to disclose them. In between the company becoming aware of the processor security problems, and their public disclosure, Krzanich gained $24 million by selling all of the shares and options he was allowed to sell under his contract.  The company has said his stock sale was unrelated to the Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities, noting that it was done as part of a planned stock sale. But Krzanich put that plan in place just the month before \u2014 some five months after Intel became aware of the Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities.  Intel is facing some 35 lawsuits related to Spectre and Meltdown  Intel's handling of the disclosure of the exploits is now the subject of some 35 lawsuits, including a pair of shareholder derivative suits specifically related to Krzanich's stock sale.  Similar questions were raised about stock sales by Equifax executives made last year, in between the company becoming aware of a massive security breach and it disclosing that breach to the public.  It's unclear whether the SEC's new guidelines were prompted by either the Equifax or Intel security issues. The Justice Department is reportedly investigating the stock sales at Equifax. It's unclear whether the department or the SEC is investigating Krzanich's sale.  The guidelines don't represent new rules. Instead, they're essentially a clarification of existing ones. As such, the fact that the agency didn't issue them until Wednesday wouldn't bar it from investigating Krzanich's sale, even though that sale predated those guidelines.

The Spectre and Meltdown attacks were a public relations nightmare for Intel. Now they've become a legal headache as well.  The chip making giant, its board members, and executives face 35 lawsuits related to the attacks, the company disclosed in its annual report on Friday.

And, unlike chips made by other manufacturers, Intel's processors are vulnerable to both Spectre and Meltdown.  Intel's handling of Spectre and Meltdown has drawn criticism \u2014 and now lawsuits  Intel's handling of the situation has raised eyebrows not just because it waited more than six months to disclose the attacks to the public despite the fact that its chips were particularly at risk of them, but also because of a massive stock sale made by company CEO Brian Krzanich after the company found out about the attacks. In sale \u2014 through which Krzanich saw a $24 million windfall \u2014 the CEO sold off all of the shares of Intel he was allowed to sell under his contract.  Intel has noted that the sale, which Krzanich made in November, was done as part of a planned stock divestiture. But Krzanich only put that plan in place a month earlier, which was more than four months after Intel became aware of the attacks.  Thirty of the lawsuits filed against Intel are seeking class action status and were filed by customers who claim they were harmed by the attacks or by the company's failure to disclose them, according to the annual report. Two of the suits, also seeking class action status, were filed on behalf of shareholders who charge that the disclosure of the attacks shows that statements Intel made about its products or business were false or misleading.  Additionally, another three Intel investors have filed shareholder derivative suits in California state court, according to the annual report.

Amid the scramble, Intel, the company most affected by the flaws, has seen its stock price slump.  But, as the company prepares to report earnings soon, one analyst thinks the company will be fine in the near term.  Watch Intel's stock price move in real time here.    Spectre and Meltdown, arguably the two biggest flaws ever found in modern computers, might not have a big impact on the near-term earnings of Intel, the company hit the hardest by the flaws.  At least, that's the thinking of John Pitzer, an analyst at Credit Suisse.  \"While our calendar first quarter estimates embed NO negative impact to revenue from the Meltdown/Spectre security issues \u2013 near term we would highlight that the uncertainty created could cause at least some calendar first quarter server/client purchases to be deferred as IT managers look for more clarity,\" Pitzer said in a note to clients.  Spectre and Meltdown are flaws in a technique modern CPUs use to speed up computing. There are three total variations of the two flaws, and Intel is the only company whose chips have been reported to be affected by all three. The company has seen its share price decline about 8.73% so far this year after the flaws were disclosed publicly.  Pizter previously released a report the day after the flaws were disclosed that claimed everyone was making \"mountains from molehills\" regarding the flaws. A lot of new information about the flaws has surfaced since then, but Pizter is holding his ground, saying Intel's near-term revenue largely won't be affected.  There have been confusing and conflicting reports around the flaws since their public disclosure, however. AMD, which is Intel's main rival in the space, initially said its hardware would not be affected by the flaws, and later reversed its stance. Nvidia, which makes GPUs, created confusion when it issued Spectre and Meltdown patches for its products which were thought to be impervious to the flaws. Nvidia later clarified that its patches were only precautionary, and its products are not affected.  Patches to fix CPUs affected by the flaws were initially thought to slow down certain programs by as much as 30%, and an exact impact on performance has yet to be determined. Pitzer said IT managers and big data centers could delay planned purchases of Intel chips until more clarity is found, and the long-term effects of the flaws for chipmakers won't be evident for some time.  If certain companies' chips are found to be faster than others after all the final Spectre and Meltdown patches have been issued, there could be a sector-wide shift to the faster chips, Pitzer said.  Pizter has a \"neutral\" rating on Intel, but said it's mostly because he thinks the company is too expensive right now, not because of the potential risks associated with Spectre and Meltdown.  Intel reports fourth quarter earnings January 25, and Pitzer thinks the results will fall in line with Wall Street's expectations. Pizter is expecting earnings per share of $0.86 on revenue of $16.3 billion.

Millennials are buying shares 10 times more often than they are selling them, according to the Stockpile trading app.  Watch how the stock is moving in real time here.    Intel is set to report earnings after the bell on Thursday, and millennials are loading up on shares ahead of the report.  According to data from Stockpile, an app that allows trading of fractional stock shares, young investors on the app are buying Intel stock 10 times more often then they are selling. The company is currently the 46th most popular among millennials on the Stockpile app.  This is a surprisingly strong stance, given Wall Street's lukewarm feelings toward the stock recently. About 56% of the analysts surveyed by Bloomberg are bullish on the stock, while the other 43% are neutral or bearish.  Wall Street is perhaps more hesitant because of the uncertainty around recent security flaws that affect Intel chips. The company has been working to fix a decade's worth of security issues with its processors, dubbed Spectre and Meltdown. The recently disclosed security issues allow bad actors to exploit the way modern CPUs work to find sensitive information they wouldn't normally have access to. All the major CPU makers are affected by the flaws, but Intel has been hit the hardest.  When news of the flaws initially broke, investors flocked to Intel's rival, AMD, sending shares of the company up 16.29% this year. It's a stark contrast to Intel's shares which have slipped about 4%.  Ahead of the company's fourth-quarter earnings report, set to be released after the bell on Thursday, Wall Street is expecting adjusted earnings of $0.87 per share on revenue of $16.347 billion, according to data from Bloomberg.  Investors will likely be watching for comments on how the Spectre and Meltdown patches are coming along, and for more clarity about the flaws' impact on the company's business. Some analysts think it will likely impact the first quarter of 2018, but only because major chip buyers will delay their purchases until more clarity is found.

The Journal is reporting that Intel notified some of its customers of the security flaws in its processors, dubbed Spectre and Meltdown, but left out the U.S. government as part of that. Some of the companies Intel notified included Chinese technology companies, though the report suggests there is no evidence that any information was misused. An Intel spokesperson told The Journal that the company wasn\u2019t able to tell everyone it planned because the news was made public earlier than expected.  The latter part of that is probably going to sting a little harder because it would seem that Intel was going to give the U.S. government little lead time ahead of disclosure of the flaw, as security editor Zach Whittaker points out on Twitter:  This is grade A crap. Several people told me Meltdown/Spectre's planned disclosure was set for Jan. 9 but was revealed on Jan. 3 after a PoC came out. Based on WSJ, Intel was going to tell the US gov. only a week before disclosure?!

In this case, news of the exploit was reported ahead of the industry coalition\u2019s intended public disclosure date at which point Intel immediately engaged the US government and others.\u201d  Intel has had to scramble to respond to the news, which came out nearly a week earlier than expected. Companies can notify some major customers and parties of flaws before they\u2019re publicly disclosed so fixes and patches can come out and contain as much of the fallout as possible. The Meltdown and Specter flaws were particularly hazardous because they theoretically can affect pretty much everyone and the end result is a massive cleanup effort to make sure everything gets patched.  But because of the scale of the issue, and Intel\u2019s very precarious position of having to ensure as limited impact to its customers as possible, it\u2019s a very tricky situation to figure out who to inform and when in order to ensure everything gets resolved without the information becoming widespread and a source of additional risk for those customers. Intel reported its fourth-quarter earnings last week, after which the stock jumped nearly 10% despite the news about Meltdown and Spectre continuing to trickle in.  \u201cWhile we\u2019ve made progress, I am acutely aware that we have more to do,\u201d Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said on the call to discuss its fourth quarter results. \u201cWe\u2019ve committed to being transparent, keeping our customers and owners appraised of our progress and, through our actions, building trust. Security is a top priority for Intel, foundational to our products, and it\u2019s critical to the success of our data-centric strategy. Our near-term focus is on delivering high-quality mitigations to protect our customers\u2019 infrastructure on these exploits. We\u2019re working to incorporate silicon-based changes to future products that will directly address the Spectre and Meltdown threats in hardware, and those products will begin appearing later this year.

Google Glasses never had a chance, and even the Snap Spectacles heyday has come to an end. But that\u2019s not stopping Intel from getting in on the fun.  The glasses are called Vaunt, first seen by the Verge, and they are nearly indistinguishable from regular glasses. Instead of some cumbersome headset with a special screen, Intel\u2019s Vaunt glasses are simple plastic frames that weigh under 50 grams (nearly the exact weight of Snap Spectacles). The smart glasses work with prescription and non-prescription lenses, and there is no camera equipped.  To any onlooker, you might just be wearing a pair of Warby Parkers.  But on the inside of the stems sits a low-powered class one laser, as well as a processor, an accelerometer, a Bluetooth chip and a compass.  This laser, which Intel says is \u201cso low-power that it\u2019s at the very bottom end of a class one laser,\u201d emits a red, monochrome image into your eye at 400 x 150 pixels.

While future models might be equipped with a microphone and access to smart assistants like Alexa or Siri, the first-gen Vaunt models will be controlled through subtle motion gestures like a nod of the head. Intel wants these glasses to fit into your life as naturally as possible.  While it\u2019s unclear just how the Vaunt glasses will come to market, Intel has said that the OEM route is a more likely strategy than Intel selling these specs themselves.

This time out, however, we can expect a lot around 5G. And as for next year\u2019s show? Well, then we\u2019ll finally start talking about some 5G. Mobile infrastructure is a hard thing to make sexy, but it is, indeed, the future, and you can anticipate a lot more talk around the technology that will power the next generation of mobile devices at next week\u2019s big show in Barcelona.  We\u2019re still some days off from the actual event, and already Intel\u2019s showing off a little of what they\u2019ll be talking about at MWC. Perhaps somewhat ironically, the company will be using the world\u2019s biggest mobile show to show some of the work it\u2019s been doing on the PC side of the spectrum \u2014 but then, this is Intel, after all.  The chip maker will be using the event to debut some early demos of its forthcoming 5G-enabled two-in-one devices. Not a lot in the way of specifics around the devices at the moment, but Intel\u2019s been partnering with most of the biggest names in the Windows device space, including Dell, HP, Lenovo and, naturally, Microsoft, with a goal of bringing products to market by the end of 2019.  Those systems will be powered by the XMM 8060, the 5G modem the company announced back in November. Given the timeline here, it\u2019s no surprise, really, that these are still firmly in the \u201cconcept\u201d phase. In a call this week, Intel\u2019s Group President and Chief Engineering Officer Murthy Renduchintala told TechCrunch that managing the hype cycle around 5G is still a balancing act.  \u201cIt\u2019s always a balance between talking about the evolution of the present and the future,\u201d Renduchintala said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s got that down to a science, Intel included.

In our conversation, Renduchintala repeatedly refers to the company as an \u201cunderdog.\u201d It\u2019s still a little jarring when referring to a company that pulled in $62 billion in 2017, but it\u2019s not entirely inappropriate when discussing the race to 5G.  \u201cIt\u2019s important that we can attest to the resilience and fortitude of ambitions when people ask us questions about why they should take Intel seriously now when they\u2019ve only faltered in the past?\u201d Renduchintala asks, rhetorically. \u201cIntel, to some degree in the past, has been characterized by maybe needing to talk a little less and be a little more. To be the underdog and surprise people with the capability and the precision of what we can deliver in 5G.\u201d  Phones will certainly be a part of the company\u2019s play. In a blog post this morning, Intel points out that it is looking to make an aggressive push into the ever-growing China market. \u201cTo expand our entry into the China phone ecosystem, Intel and Unigroup Spreadtrum and RDA have established a multi-year collaboration to develop a portfolio of 5G products for mobile platforms, combining Intel 5G modems with Spreadtrum application processor technology.\u201d  Though, the company continues to have a formidable opponent in Qualcomm. No one knows better than Renduchintala, who spent a dozen years at the Southern California mobile chip giant.  \u201cI have every reason to believe Qualcomm will continue to be exemplary in its execution and delivery of world-class solutions,\u201d Renduchintala explains. \u201cI do think Intel will be a formidable and very meritorious competitor to Qualcomm in this space. On the modem and technology side, we\u2019re going to be investing and executing on a level where we think we can give Qualcomm an extremely competitive environment.

The TunnelBear team will also keep working on TunnelBear products under its own brand. According to the announcement, TunnelBear was a profitable company.  You might remember that Intel acquired McAfee back in 2011. Intel even rebranded the company to Intel Security. But the company was spun out a couple of years ago. McAfee is now an independent company again, and this represents McAfee\u2019s second acquisition after breaking up with Intel.  TunnelBear has been providing a paid VPN service with desktop and mobile apps. For $4.99 to $9.99 per month, you can connect to one of TunnelBear\u2019s servers so that people sharing the same Wi-Fi network can\u2019t look at your data packets, or so that you can access restricted websites if you\u2019re in China for instance.

I\u2019m glad companies like TunnelBear are setting a good example and I hope more companies will follow that path.  More generally, you shouldn\u2019t trust any VPN company because the risks are too high. A VPN provider can basically see everything you do on the internet.

It\u2019s a synergistic relationship at an exciting time to be shaping the future of urban mobility.\u201d  To date, Moovit has raised around $131 million in funding, and while it\u2019s not revealing its valuation, in its last round in 2015 it was valued at $450 million, and given its growth since then (it only had 15 million users at the time, versus 120 million today), it\u2019s very likely that the valuation now is well above $500 million post-money. We\u2019ll be asking Erez when we speak to him later, to see if we can shed more light on that front.  The deal comes at an interesting time in the navigation and mapping space. Citymapper, a mapping and transit navigation app based out of London, has been testing out different ideas to figure out how to monetise its service.

Well, two out of three, anyway.  CEO Brian Krzanich announced the news in a company blog post.

There will still be an Intel CPU in every Mac, but with a second ARM processor.  Currently, the MacBook Pro features a T1 chip while the iMac Pro features a T2 chip. On the MacBook Pro, the ARM coprocessor handles the Touch ID sensor and the Touch Bar.  This way, your fingerprint is never stored on your laptop\u2019s SSD drive \u2014 it remains on the T1 secure enclave. The Intel CPU only gets a positive response when a fingerprint is validated.  The iMac Pro goes one step further and uses the T2 to replace many discrete controllers. The T2 controls your stereo speakers, your internal microphone, the fans, the camera and internal storage. The coprocessor can encrypt data in real time. And when you boot up the device, the T2 first validates the integrity of the system before handing it over to the Intel CPU.  Everyone already knows that Apple is still working on a brand new Mac Pro. And it would make sense to include an ARM coprocessor on this high-end desktop machine. But it looks like the company wants to use ARM coprocessors across the entire lineup.  Bloomberg thinks two laptop models will get an ARM coprocessor this year.

The bipartisan committee offered a set of measures to defend domestic election infrastructure against hostile foreign nations.  Before launching into the findings from its committee-wide examination of current practices, written up in an accompanying report, the group emphasized that states are \u201cfirmly in the lead\u201d in conducting elections, although the federal government should work closely to provide funds and information.  Although there are many factors that can mitigate the risk to U.S. elections, election equipment itself, particularly internet-connected systems, remains a core concern in the report:  States should rapidly replace outdated and vulnerable voting systems. At a minimum, any machine purchased going forward should have a voter-verified paper trail and no WiFi capability. If use of paper ballots becomes more widespread, election officials should re-examine current practices for securing the chain of custody of all paper ballots and verify no opportunities exist for the introduction of fraudulent votes.  Because financial need varies from state to state, the committee recommended legislation that would create a grant program through which states could apply for election security funds, including the funding needed to conduct system audits.  \u201cStates should use grant funds to improve cybersecurity by hiring additional Information Technology staff, updating software, and contracting vendors to provide cybersecurity services, among other steps,\u201d the report states.  The rest of the report focused on how to bolster U.S. election infrastructure and practice against foreign attacks. Now that the potential vulnerability of U.S. election systems is widely known, Russia may not be the only adversary looking to poke holes in U.S. systems.  \u201cIt may not be the Russians next time,\u201d Senator James Lankford said. \u201cThey have set a pattern that others could follow.\u201d That means that Iran, North Korea or even domestic hacktivist groups could be following along.  The committee recommends that the U.S. work with allied countries to create international cyber standards to deter hostile nations from taking advantage of current gray areas in cyber policy, making it clear that attacks on election systems are \u201chostile acts.\u201d  \u201cWe need a more transparent cyber doctrine so that other nation-states are on notice,\u201d New Mexico Senator Martin Heinrich said.  The committee made multiple mentions of the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s failure to coordinate with states \u2014 and state-level distrust of that department \u2014 during the 2016 election. In the past, information sharing between federal and state officials has been hampered by slow processes for obtaining the proper security clearances for state and local election workers.  \u201cThe Intelligence Community should work to declassify information quickly, whenever possible, to provide warning to appropriate state and local officials,\u201d the report states.  States also lag behind when it comes to knowledge and implementation of basic cybersecurity best practices like two-factor authentication.

Those processors were eventually eclipsed by chips from Intel, which put its considerable muscle behind a competing design. But as computing expanded into smartphones, tablets, and other small devices \u2014 where power and space are at a premium \u2014 more and more chips used designs from a British company called ARM, short for Advanced RISC Machine.

In the QAnon reality, Trump only pretended to collude with Russia in order to create a pretext for the hiring of Robert Mueller, the special counsel, who is actually working with Trump to take down an inconceivably evil and powerful network of coup-plotters and child sex traffickers that includes Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and George Soros.", "stock": "INTC", "label": -1, "date": "2018-04-06", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/06/opinion/qanon-trump-conspiracy-theory.html"}, {"article": "The issue repeatedly flared without resolution under the Obama administration, peaking in 2016, when the government tried to force Apple to help it break into the iPhone of one of the attackers in the terrorist assault in San Bernardino, Calif.  The debate receded when the Trump administration took office, but in recent months top officials like Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, and Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, have begun talking publicly about the \u201cgoing dark\u201d problem.  The National Security Council and the Justice Department declined to comment about the internal deliberations. The people familiar with the talks spoke on the condition of anonymity, cautioning that they were at a preliminary stage and that no request for legislation was imminent.  But the renewed push is certain to be met with resistance.  \u201cBuilding an exceptional access system is a complicated engineering problem with many parts that all have to work perfectly in order for it to be secure, and no one has a solution to it,\u201d said Susan Landau, a Tufts University computer security professor. \u201cAny of the options people are talking about now would heighten the danger that your phone or your laptop could be hacked and data taken off of it.\u201d  Craig Federighi, the senior vice president of software engineering at Apple, stressed the importance of strengthening \u2014 not weakening \u2014 security protections for products like the iPhone, saying threats to data security were increasing every day and arguing that it was a question of \u201csecurity versus security\u201d rather than security versus privacy.  \u201cProposals that involve giving the keys to customers\u2019 device data to anyone but the customer inject new and dangerous weaknesses into product security,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWeakening security makes no sense when you consider that customers rely on our products to keep their personal information safe, run their businesses or even manage vital infrastructure like power grids and transportation systems.\u201d  But some computer security researchers believe the problem might be solvable with an acceptable level of new risks.

While it largely described challenges to solving the problem, one section cited presentations by several technologists who are developing potential approaches.  They included Ray Ozzie, a former chief software architect at Microsoft; Stefan Savage, a computer science professor at the University of California, San Diego; and Ernie Brickell, a former chief security officer at Intel.  Photo  According to several people familiar with the new round of deliberations, those three men have been participating in a series of workshops convened at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Daniel Weitzner, a computer science professor. They have discussed their research with government officials, including Valerie Cofield, a senior F.B.I. science and technology official working on \u201cgoing dark\u201d issues.  The researchers, Mr. Ozzie said, recognized that \u201cthis issue is not going away,\u201d and were trying to foster \u201cconstructive dialogue\u201d rather than declaring that no solution is possible.  Mr. Savage said the talks had focused on trying to create a safe enough way to unlock data on encrypted devices, as opposed to the separate matter of decoding intercepted messages sent via encrypted communications services, like Signal and WhatsApp.  Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Data in motion and the cloud are much harder to deal with.\u201d  The deliberations shed new light on public remarks by Trump administration officials in recent months. In October, Mr. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, argued in a speech that permitting technology companies to create \u201cwarrant-proof encryption\u201d was endangering society.  \u201cTechnology companies almost certainly will not develop responsible encryption if left to their own devices,\u201d he said. \u201cCompetition will fuel a mind-set that leads them to produce products that are more and more impregnable. That will give criminals and terrorists more opportunities to cause harm with impunity.\u201d  And Mr. Wray, the F.B.I. director, has twice given speeches this year in which he pointed to Symphony, an encrypted messaging system for banks. Pushed by a state regulator, several banks agreed to give copies of their Symphony keys to law firms. Because Symphony keeps a copy of encrypted data on its servers, that arrangement created a backup means for investigators to gain access to the messages if necessary.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  \u201cAt the end, the data in Symphony was still secure, still encrypted, but also accessible to the regulators so they could do their jobs,\u201d Mr. Wray told a cybersecurity conference in Boston this month. \u201cI\u2019m confident that by working together and finding similar areas to agree and compromise, we can come up with solutions to the \u2018going dark\u2019 problem.\u201d  The Symphony approach, however, would not work for millions of ordinary smartphone users. But one alternative being worked on by Mr. Ozzie and others is receiving particular attention inside the government.  The idea is that when devices encrypt themselves, they would generate a special access key that could unlock their data without the owner\u2019s passcode. This electronic key would be stored on the device itself, inside part of its hard drive that would be separately encrypted \u2014 so that only the manufacturer, in response to a court order, could open it.  Law enforcement officials see that idea as attractive in part because companies like Apple are already trusted to securely hold special keys permitting them to push operating system updates to devices like iPhones.  Still, Ms. Landau argued that creating such a system would create significant additional security risks. She noted, among other things, that updates are relatively rare but police would want seized phones opened every day \u2014 so many more tech company employees would need access to the powerful new keys, increasing the risk of theft or abuse.  The Obama administration never agreed on asking for legislation mandating access mechanisms. Military and cybersecurity agencies worried that weakening security would create new problems, and commerce officials worried about quashing innovation and making American tech products less competitive.  Still, in 2016, the Obama administration\u2019s deliberations also came to focus on the idea of access keys on devices, a participant said, but stalled because of difficult technical questions about the details. They included how to prevent criminals from deleting the access keys on their devices or from using phones that do not have the mechanism because they run on outdated software or were built for foreign markets.  But one Justice Department official familiar with the deliberations contended that it might not be necessary to come up with a foolproof system, arguing that a solution that would work for ordinary, less-savvy criminals was still worth pursuing.  Mr. Brickell, the former Intel official, echoed that view. Enforcing compliance with a rule that devices must have access mechanisms to function \u201cis a difficult problem,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s keep working on it.

Ms. Sanders referred questions about the security clearance process \u2014 and why Mr. Porter was allowed to continue working at the White House for so long despite the abuse accusations \u2014 to the F.B.I. and the intelligence agencies, saying they are the ones that handle the background checks and the granting of permission to handle classified information.  \u201cIt\u2019s up to those same law enforcement and intelligence agencies to determine if changes need to be made to their process,\u201d she said.  The F.B.I. had no comment on Monday.  The finger-pointing has frustrated Democratic members of Congress, who have pushed to gain visibility into the security clearance procedure at the White House.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina and the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, has refused to ask the White House for any information about security clearances or for a formal briefing on the matter, Democrats on the panel said Monday. He has also refused to allow the committee to vote on three subpoenas proposed by Democrats, including one on interim clearances.  Mr. Gowdy\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment.  In a letter sent last week, Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the top Democrat on the committee, pressed Mr. Gowdy to more aggressively tackle the security clearance issue, saying that news of Mr. Porter\u2019s problems had given the matter renewed urgency.  \u201cIf you had agreed to any of our previous requests for information on these matters, the White House would have been required to answer key questions about why Mr. Porter was denied a final security clearance,\u201d Mr. Cummings wrote.  \u201cInstead, because of your multiple refusals, we did not find out about any of these issues until they were reported in the press,\u201d he added.  The process for allowing White House officials to work with secret, classified material typically begins when West Wing employees are subjected to a brief background check and are granted interim clearance. A full background check by the F.B.I. and, in some cases, the C.I.A. then begins.  Officials with previous administrations said it is not uncommon for the full background checks to take as long as eight months or a year, in part because of a long backlog in vetting the backgrounds of people needing clearance across the federal government.  Video  Background checks take about a year for Pentagon employees and six to seven months for prospective C.I.A. or National Security Agency workers, a senior American official said.  But several former White House officials said it is also common for administration officials to encourage the investigators to give top priority to senior presidential aides like Mr. Porter and Mr. Kushner.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  What Mr. McGahn and other top White House officials learned about the allegations against Mr. Porter, and when they learned it, remains murky.  Mr. Porter told Mr. McGahn in January 2017 that there could be what he described as false allegations against him, according to two people briefed on the situation. In June, the F.B.I. informed the White House security office that allegations of domestic abuse had surfaced. Mr. McGahn was made aware at the time that there was an issue with Mr. Porter\u2019s background investigation, but relied on the security office to continue pursuing the background check.  White House officials disputed that assertion, saying on Monday that Mr. McGahn was not made aware during the summer of any problems with Mr. Porter\u2019s clearance.  In November, the bureau delivered a thick file on Mr. Porter\u2019s background check to the security office and relayed that he was not likely to succeed in getting a permanent clearance, according to one person briefed on the case. Security office officials encouraged the F.B.I. to complete its investigation so the office could make a final determination on Mr. Porter\u2019s clearance.  One person briefed on the situation, who had insisted on anonymity to discuss private deliberations, said late last week that the bureau had informed Mr. McGahn when the file was delivered that the allegations against Mr. Porter were likely to derail his security clearance. But on Monday, the person said that he had been mistaken, and contended that Mr. McGahn had not learned of the F.B.I.\u2019s communications to the security office until much later.  In Mr. Kushner\u2019s case, a final decision about a permanent security clearance is also still pending.  Mr. Lowell said that it should not be surprising that someone with \u201cthe extent of his holdings, travels and lengthy submissions\u201d would require a lengthy background check. But he took issue with the suggestion that the delays somehow affect Mr. Kushner\u2019s ability to do his job at the White House.  \u201cThis is just the latest,\u201d he said, \u201cin unnamed sources quoting secondhand hearsay concerning Mr. Kushner that, like the others, will be shown to be untrue.\u201d", "stock": "INTC", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-13", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/12/us/politics/white-house-security-clearances-jared-kushner.html"}, {"article": "The Intel Optane SSD 800P could have been a tour de force with its promising 3D XPoint technology, but it\u2019s ultimately hamstrung by tiny capacities and a hampered interface.  Intel unleashed unbelievably fast Optane 900P SSDs earlier this year but, to our chagrin, they\u2019re not exactly affordable at $369 (\u00a3329, AU$559) for the smallest, 280GB drive. Not to mention 900P drives don\u2019t come in the easy-to-install and ubiquitous M.2 form factor \u2013 instead, they\u2019ve only been available as a beefy PCIe card or U.2 drive.  So, enter the Intel Optane SSD 800P drives. These drives pack the same 3D XPoint technology that makes the 900P series so blazing fast into a far smaller package. Plus, these gum stick-sized SSDs start at a more affordable price, albeit with much, much smaller capacities, with 58GB running for $129 (about \u00a390, AU$165) and $199 (about \u00a3140, AU$255) for 118GB.  While these drives should be just as fast as the company\u2019s flagship enterprise drives, poor decisions to limit its maximum bandwidth, capacity and performance \u2013 no to mention a still high asking price \u2013 make them hard recommend for anyone.  Features  Whereas the Intel Optane SSD 900P was introduced as a high-end storage solution, the Intel Optane SSD 800P was announced as mainstream storage for use as a primary \u2013 or operating system boot \u2013 drive.  However, we find it tough see ourselves using a 58GB SSD as our main drive. Even if we were to RAID two 118GB drives together for a total of 236GB, it seems puny compared to the other 256GB SSDs we could pick up for half the price and far less complexity.  The Intel Optane SSD 800P\u2019s headline feature should be 3D XPoint, which is designed to deliver 1,000 times the performance, 1,000 times the speed, and 10 times the capacity of traditional NAND.  Unfortunately, the tiny capacities in which you can buy an Optane SSD 800P don\u2019t really support Intel\u2019s claims. Speed-wise, these drives are also limited by a PCIe 3.0 x 2 interface that can only achieve up to 1,450MB/s and 640MB/s sequential read and write speeds, respectively.  That\u2019s half as slow as the speeds we see from other mainstream NVMe drives, such as the Samsung 960 Evo or Intel\u2019s own 760p Series SSD .  Image 1 of 6 Image 2 of 6 Image 3 of 6 Image 4 of 6 Image 5 of 6 Image 6 of 6  Performance  In our standard battery of storage benchmarks, the Optane SSD 800P falters behind many other drives. Unsurprisingly, the drive\u2019s sequential read and write speeds are half of other drives utilizing PCIe 3.0 x 4 interface. This leaves us to conclude there\u2019s an intrinsic connection between the halved performance and using only half as many PCIe lanes.  Surprisingly, the Intel Optane SSD 800P achieves some of the best random write speeds we\u2019ve seen, though, once again random read performance leaves us wanting.  Intel claims that its newest mainstream drive is most effective at operating with low queue depth. (If you\u2019ve never heard of the phrase before, queue depth refers to the number of read or write operations a volume of storage can handle at the same time.)  However, our simple file transfer tests show that this really isn\u2019t the case. The Intel Optane SSD 800P takes almost the longest to complete a 10GB file transfer compared against Intel Optane SSD 900P, Intel 760p and Samsung 960 Evo. It fares better when moving a 10GB folder, but you\u2019re still looking at paying much more for this drive that doesn\u2019t perform significantly better.  Final verdict  In the end, we\u2019re at a loss as to who the Intel Optane SSD 800P would be ideal for. To even get a decent amount of storage, you would have to buy two 118GB drives for $199 (about \u00a3140, AU$255) each \u2013 then go through the trouble of arranging them into a RAID.  Meanwhile, most \u2018mainstream\u2019 users would get more storage, a cheaper price and better performance by going with a 256GB Intel 760p Series SSD for $109 (\u00a3113, AU$169) or 250GB Samsung 960 Evo for $119 (\u00a3129, AU$189).

This year, the Hades Canyon NUC represents a partnership between Intel and AMD we would have never expected \u2013 or even fathomed.  It\u2019s easily the smallest VR-capable PC that marries together an Intel quad-core processor with integrated, \u2018discrete-class\u2019 AMD Radeon RX Vega graphics into a single chip. With all that power under its belt, this gaming PC easily smashes through Full HD gaming with most modern titles and performs like a productivity champ.  Despite all the caveats of that comes with a barebones computer such as this, the Intel Hades Canyon NUC earns top marks for packing so much performance into a small package. It\u2019s one of the best and our favorite mini PC of the year so far.  Spec Sheet Here is the Intel Hades Canyon NUC configuration sent to TechRadar for review: CPU: 3.1GHz Intel Core i7-8809G (quad-core, 8MB Cache, up to 4.2GHz)  Graphics: Radeon RX Vega M GH graphics (4GB HBM2 VRAM), Intel UHD Graphics 630  RAM: Kingston HyperX 16GB DDR4 (3,200MHz)  Storage: 118GB Intel Optane SSD 800P Series (NVMe), 512GB Intel SSD 545s Series (M.2 SATA)  Ports (front): 1 x USB-C 3.1 Gen 2, 1 x USB-A 3.1 Gen 2, 1 x USB-A 3.1 Gen 1, SD card reader, HDMI 2.0a  Ports (rear): 2 x Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C), 4 x USB 3.0, HDMI 2.0a, 2 x mini DisplayPort, 2 x Ethernet, optical audio out  Connectivity: Intel Wireless-AC 8265, Bluetooth 4.2  Weight: 2 pounds (0.91kg)  Size: 8.7 x 5.6 x 1.54 inches (22.1 x 14.2 x 3.9cm; W x D x H)  Price and availability  Our particular Intel Hades Canyon NUC8i7HVK review unit costs $999 (about \u00a3710, AU$1,302), which is about half-to-a-third off the price of an equally competent gaming laptop . Not too shabby for a PC equipped with a quad-core Intel Core i7 and nearly Nvidia GTX 1060 equivalent graphics.  That said, this barebones unit doesn\u2019t come with storage, memory or an operating system, so you\u2019ll have to get those pieces on your own.  There\u2019s also an entry-level Intel Hades Canyon NUC8i7HNK priced at $799 (about \u00a3570, AU$1,040). This more affordable NUC comes still comes with a quad-core i7 CPU, but it maxes out at a slower frequency. Meanwhile, the onboard Radeon RX Vega M GL GPU has four fewer compute units and won\u2019t run as fast either.  Compared to other barebone PCs, the high-end Intel Hades Canyon NUC compares well against the $949 (\u00a3619, AU$1,739) Zotac Zbox Magnus EN1060K and $999 (\u00a3819, AU$1,579) Gigabyte Brix GB-BNi7HG6-1060. Both of these mini PCs feature older Kaby Lake processors but a Nvidia GTX 1060 with two more GB of video RAM and higher CUDA  Image 1 of 6 Image 2 of 6 Image 3 of 6 Image 4 of 6 Image 5 of 6 Image 6 of 6  Design  At first blush, the Hades Canyon NUC looks more like a set top box than a desktop PC, and that\u2019s honestly a good thing. The device is interesting enough to look like more than just a plain box in your home entertainment setup while also not being too distracting if you decide to use it as your work computer.  If you remember the Skull Canyon NUC Intel released two years prior, the Hades Canyon should look very familiar. Both units share the same overall shape, plus an identical hexagonal motif for the ventilation holes and top panel. Of course, with the integration of \u2018discrete-class\u2019 graphics and sufficient cooling to back it up, Intel\u2019s flagship NUC is almost twice as large as its predecessor.  Intel\u2019s design has also seen some improvements. The old interchangeable plastic panels have been replaced by a much slicker light-up skull fashioned after the silicon that resides within. The lighting on this part of the case and all the little hard drive and power indicators are fully customizable \u2013 or you could just turn them all off for a stealthy unit.  Despite this PC\u2019s small size, it packs an impressive amount of ports. Along the backside alone you\u2019ll find four USB 3.0 ports, two ThunderBolt 3 ports, two mini DisplayPorts, HDMI 2.0 and even two Gigabit Ethernet ports. That\u2019s more connectivity than you\u2019ll even find on some full-size desktops.  Cracking open the Hades Canyon NUC is a breeze, as it just requires undoing six torx screws and a single Philips head. With the top cover removed, you can access the computer\u2019s memory slots as well as the M.2 NVMe and SATA drives.

We can play all our favorite games, including Far Cry 5 and Warhammer: Vermintide 2, at a steady 60 frames per second (fps) with high-quality graphical settings and a 1080p resolution.  Even more impressive is that the little PC holds it own through Overwatch and Hitman at 1440p with HDR active on a Samsung CHG70 QLED gaming monitor. The only title to give us some measurable difficulty is Assassin\u2019s Creed Origins, but it still runs at a completely playable 40fps with high quality settings and a 1080p resolution.  Outside of gaming, the Intel Hades Canyon NUC runs like a champ through all our regular web browsing and word processing, as well as our image and video editing needs. For those multi-monitor fans, the Intel Hades Canyon NUC can also drive up to six screens.  Compared to comparable notebook hardware in the 15-inch Microsoft Surface Book 2 , the Intel NUC almost wins the complete race in both processor and graphically intensive tests. A full-on gaming laptop like the Dell Inspiron 15 7000 Gaming manages to close the gap a little better, but for the most part the Hades Canyon stays on top.  Meanwhile, a gaming PC with actual desktop parts, like the Asus ROG G20CI , proves to be tougher competition. While the NUC manages to score better in the processor tests, the integrated graphics just can\u2019t keep up with a Nvidia GTX 1080 \u2013 then again, neither could the AMD Radeon RX Vega 64 .  Final verdict  The Intel Hades Canyon NUC is the company\u2019s most impressive mini PC yet, capable of playing most modern games with ease and offering plenty of performance for everyday computing. And, that\u2019s all without the help of an external GPU, unlike the previous Skull Canyon NUC.  This is true high-end desktop computing on a single, standalone chip. Beyond this one device, it represents a turning point for thin-and-light laptops like HP Spectre x360 15 and Dell XPS 15 2-in-1 to be just as powerful as full-on gaming laptops  Although the Hades Canyon NUC might be expensive and require additional parts, you won\u2019t find another mini PC as powerful as this. The expansive array of ports and support for high-end internal components is equally as amazing. Thanks to its small size, it's also the perfect home theater PC.  All in all, Intel has produced an incredibly tiny and VR-capable gaming PC worthy of your attention and consideration.", "stock": "INTC", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-29", "source": "techradar", "url": "https://www.techradar.com/reviews/intel-hades-canyon-nuc"}, {"article": "The Intel 760p Series SSD is one of the best deals you can get on a NVMe capable drive. This SSD is priced so low we would call it a no-brainer for all modern PC builds.  Our biggest pet peeve with computing nowadays \u2013 aside from the price of graphics cards being too damn high, thanks to bitcoin mining \u2013 is the lack of affordable and fast NVMe solid-state storage. Thankfully, that\u2019s starting to change this year, and Intel\u2019s new 760p Series SSD has us absolutely giddy.  Built upon Intel\u2019s new 64-layer 3D NAND technology, the 760p Series not only doubles the speed of its previous consumer SSDs, it\u2019s also nearly as affordable. Starting at $74 (about \u00a350, AU$90) for an 128GB drive, $109 (about \u00a380, AU$140) for 256GB and $199 (about \u00a3140, AU$250) for 512GB \u2013 which we tested \u2013 these are some of the cheapest NVMe drives you\u2019re going to find this year.  Features  Again, Intel\u2019s 760p Series SSDs use the company\u2019s new 64-layer 3D NAND technology that\u2019s twice as dense as the company\u2019s 32-layer NAND used on the previous generation of Intel 600p Series SSDs. Thanks to this doubling of density, Intel promises its new drives are nearly twice as fast and more power efficient than before.  The 512GB capacity 760p Series is rated for 3,230 MB/s sequential read and 1,625 MB/s sequential write speeds. That\u2019s a significant increase from the 512GB Intel SSD 600p\u2019s 1,775 MB/s and 560 MB/s sequential read and write speeds, respectively.  It\u2019s also enough speed to give Samsung\u2019s almost undisputed 960 Evo SSDs reason to worry. Though Samsung\u2019s NVMe drive still pulls slightly ahead with 3,200 MB/s and 1,800 MB/s sequential read and write speeds, respectively, it's also more expensive with a 500GB capacity unit priced at $229 (\u00a3223, AU$315).  Benchmarks Crystaldisk Mark (Sequential) Read: 3,056.6 MB/s Write: 1,606.6 MB/s  Crystaldisk Mark (Random) Read: 384.3 MB/s; Write: 322 MB/s  ATTO Benchmark (Sequential) Read: 2,843 MB/s; Write: 1,617 MB/s  Performance  In our testing, the 512GB Intel 760p Series SSD peaked at 3,056.6 MB/s and 1,606.6 MB/s sequential read and write speeds, respectively. Though it doesn\u2019t completely hit on the promised speeds, we expect performance will only get better with further driver updates.  Comparatively, the Samsung 960 Evo is still a quicker with 3394.9 MB/s and 1949.3 MB/s sequential read and write speeds, respectively. But ultimately, you\u2019re also going to be paying a higher premium for that increased speed  What\u2019s more, the Intel 760p Series SSD offers more than enough high-speed read performance to make it a solid storage device for gaming. Asset-heavy, open-world games like Assassin\u2019s Creed Origins loaded like a dream while also giving us incredibly fast boot times to get into Windows 10 .  The drive\u2019s slightly sluggish write speeds might not work for impatient video editors, so we would suggest the Samsung 960 Pro for its much-faster 2,100 MB/s sequential write capabilities.  Final verdict  Intel 760p Series SSDs are a serious step up for the brand\u2019s NVMe capable solid-state drives. It\u2019s not often we see storage take a leap in speed this significant.  What\u2019s more, it\u2019s just priced extremely affordably.  A 256GB SSD with PCIe Gen 3.0 x 4 speed for $109 (about \u00a380, AU$140) is almost a no-brainer for the modern PC builder, and the $199 (about \u00a3140, AU$250) for the 512GB unit we reviewed isn\u2019t a far stretch either.

If you can\u2019t imagine wearing Magic Leap goggles or a Microsoft HoloLens visor in public, then Vaunt may be the AR solution you\u2019re looking for.  The last quasi-mainstream smart glasses were Google Glass , which spawned story after story of \u201cGlassholes\u201d using the built-in camera to record people without permission, or gesturing wildly in front of nonplussed bystanders.  Unlike other smart glasses, which rely on outward-facing cameras and motion or touch controls, Vaunt gets rid of these features entirely. Intel\u2019s New Design Group (NDG) is instead relying on a mixture of voice controls, AI, head motions and lasers to make Vaunt hands-free.  Read on the latest news and speculation on the release date, price and potential features of the Intel Vaunt augmented reality glasses.  Cut to the chase  What is it? Augmented reality smart glasses made by Intel  Augmented reality smart glasses made by Intel When is it out? There's no consumer release date yet, but an early access program is launching later this year for developers  There's no consumer release date yet, but an early access program is launching later this year for developers What will it cost? No pricing details yet, but Google Glass cost $1,500 (\u00a31,000, about AU$1,589), to give you an idea  Image credit: Vjeran Pavic/The Verge  The official developer kit will launch \u201clater this year\u201d, but Intel remains cagey on a specific date, according to The Verge .  An earlier report by Bloomberg cited sources who claimed the company plans to sell a majority stake in Vaunt to a company with solid expertise in sales channels, industry or design, rather than sell Vaunt directly to consumers.  Depending on how long this partner search takes and any tweaks that may happen as a result, this could delay Vaunt\u2019s general release date. Still, this is unlikely to stop developers from getting their hands on the first version before the year is out.  Intel Vaunt price  Intel also hasn\u2019t revealed any Intel Vaunt price information yet. Snap Spectacles only cost $130 / \u00a3105 / AU$170, while the Google Glass SDK was priced at $1,500 (\u00a31,000 / about AU$1,956).  Where Vaunt falls depends in part on how much the proprietary Vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) costs, compared to the built-in cameras found on most AR devices. Unlike its competitors, Vaunt's hardware appears to be pretty minimal, since it can fit comfortably in plastic frames.  The Verge\u2019s Dieter Bohn , who got a first look at Vaunt, speculated that the device may rely on streaming content from apps based in the cloud, or from your smartphone via Bluetooth, to run its software. This could keep hardware requirements, as well as prices, low.  We\u2019ll keep our eyes out for the latest info from Intel, but we\u2019re fairly confident predicting the price will be significantly lower than that of the Magic Leap One or HoloLens. While there's no price yet for the Leap One, the HoloLens costs $3,000 (\u00a32,719 / AU$4,369).  How it works  Vaunt's low-power laser shoots into your retina (Credit: Vjeran Pavik/The Verge) (Image: \u00a9 Vjeran Pavic/ The Verge)  With most AR glasses, people around you can clearly see if you\u2019re checking notifications or watching YouTube during a meeting. With Vaunt, the interface is nearly invisible to everyone except the wearer.  That\u2019s because Vaunt uses a low-intensity laser to reflect your notifications directly into your right eye\u2019s retina \u2014 except only in your peripheral vision, so it doesn\u2019t impair your sight. The Vaunt will connect with both iOS and Android devices to pull the wearer\u2019s notifications, similar to a smartwatch.  The designers intend wearers to be able to glance quickly into the bottom right corner of their eyesight and check for news and texts, without having to visibly pull out a phone or glance at their wrist.  The laser is a VCSEL \u2014 the same laser used by the iPhone X to scan your face for Animoji and Face ID \u2014 and one that Intel\u2019s NDG promises is too weak to cause any retinal damage. The laser reflects off of the right lens, beaming a 400 x 150 pixel image onto the retina.  Because the image sits directly on your eye, near- or far-sighted users can see the text as clearly as someone with 20-20 vision. Of course, these users will still need prescription lenses in their Vaunts to see the outside world clearly.  The plastic frames house the laser on the right and the Bluetooth, processor, and other tech on the left, so the weight is balanced. The frames weigh about 50 grams, which is slightly heavier than regular frames; by comparison, we weighed Google Glass at 42 grams.  Intel Vaunt features  The red dot in the right eye is allegedly only visible at certain angles (Credit: Vjeran Pavik/The Verge)  Right now, Intel is keeping the Vaunt\u2019s potential features strictly hypothetical. But Itai Vonshak, head of products at NDG, described some potential use cases.  A baker could ask Alexa to pull up a cookie recipe. While on the phone with your mom, a calendar pop-up will remind you that her birthday is coming up. Or, a pedestrian could stare at a restaurant and, based on their GPS position and direction they\u2019re facing, receive a Yelp pop-up with reviews \u2014 without any vocal or touch commands.  Vaunt\u2019s AI will also be able to track subtle head movements and respond to certain commands, via a built-in accelerometer. And Intel has hinted that final models could have built-in mics to communicate with voice assistants.  Of course, we haven\u2019t seen how these features would work in practice yet, and the Yelp example sounds particularly difficult to pull off. But NDG claims their AI will be able to send users all sorts of \u201cambient, contextual information\u201d based on their position and directional gaze without the user having to actually ask for it.  \u201cIf you\u2019re tapping and fiddling\u201d to get information, Vonshak tells The Verge, \u201cthen we\u2019ve lost\u201d.  Later this year, developers will be invited to an early access program to start working with the Vaunt directly. Intel is currently working on its first-party companion app, but the indication seems to be that most apps will probably run on connected smart devices, not to your glasses directly.", "stock": "INTC", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-06", "source": "techradar", "url": "http://www.techradar.com/news/intel-vaunt"}, {"article": "We knew as early as last August that Intel\u2019s Coffee Lake processors would not run on older 200-series motherboards \u2013 and would only play nice with Intel\u2019s new Z370 chipset \u2013 but now it has emerged that modders have managed to get the CPUs working with older mobos.  The story here is that while Intel\u2019s 8th-gen processors are compatible with the pins on an older LGA 1151 socket motherboard \u2013 i.e. Intel\u2019s Z270 or Z170 motherboards \u2013 they won\u2019t officially work thanks to slight differences on the power front (due to changes Intel made rejigging some reserved pins to support the power demands of the fresh six-core CPUs that arrived with Coffee Lake).  Not to be deterred by the official line, the aforementioned modders have been trying to get the new processors working in these older motherboards, and have apparently now succeeded with both Z270 and Z170-based products.  This collective effort is detailed in a post on the Overclock.net forums, and it involves a lot of technical wizardry such as tweaking the processor\u2019s microcode and integrated GPU drivers, and getting around the blocks put in place by Intel\u2019s Management Engine.  The end result was success with a Core i3-8300 CPU in several older motherboards, with the processor apparently \u2018completely working\u2019 with both Z270/Z170 Intel chipsets.  More cores, more problems\u2026  One of the contributors to this effort has apparently managed to boot a six-core Coffee Lake Core i5 CPU, but this is a more involved process still. After all, getting a PC to boot is one thing, but getting it to run decently with a Core i5 (or Core i7) processor is another.  As other contributors to that thread note, there are likely to be issues with getting a six-core processor to run successfully given the power requirements of these chips \u2013 and there's probably a very real danger of damaging the CPU.  Even running a Core i3 like this is an endeavor which should certainly be approached with caution, and generally speaking, we wouldn\u2019t recommend it. And it definitely shouldn\u2019t be attempted by anyone who isn\u2019t fully confident and tech-savvy when it comes to PCs and messing around with components.  Nonetheless, it\u2019s very interesting to see that entry-level Coffee Lake processors look like they do actually work with these older Intel motherboards, despite the official party line.

Kaby Lake was particularly noteworthy because it was behind many of the best laptops and desktop PCs of 2017, like the Dell XPS 13 and the MacBook Pro. Kaby Lake took the world by storm.  Sadly, Kaby Lake has been a confusing generation, even to the most tech savvy among us. This is mainly because Intel abandoned its longstanding \u2018tick-tock\u2019 generational model where it would alternate between optimizing the architecture of the best processors and shrinking their manufacturing process each year. Instead, Intel has released the 7th and 8th-generation Kaby Lake CPUs as the third and fourth generations using Intel\u2019s 14nm process, respectively.  Intel followed the 7th-generation Kaby Lake CPUs by releasing its 8th-generation Kaby Lake R CPUs for laptops. Intel has also recently implemented hyperthreading capabilities in its Core i3 processors for notebooks.  In October 2017, Kaby Lake R CPUs were succeeded by 8th-Generation Coffee Lake H-series CPUs, which are bringing intensely powerful 6-core, 12-thread Core i9 processors to a laptop near you.  Kaby Lake was also victim to the Spectre and Meltdown exploits, but Intel says a fix is on the way.  If all of this sounds confusing, don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ve taken the time to write up everything you need to know about Intel Kaby Lake \u2013 from price to availability to the range of processors available.  Cut to the chase  What is it? Intel's 7th- and 8th-generation Core processors  Intel's 7th- and 8th-generation Core processors When is it out? Now for both desktops and laptops  Now for both desktops and laptops What will it cost? Ranges from $42 (\u00a339, AU$66) to $350 (\u00a3415, AU$469)  After Kaby Lake released back in 2016, we saw PC makers as reputable as HP, Dell and Lenovo launch their own Kaby Lake-packed laptops and PCs. Even though it used to be considered the standard for Intel processors in early 2017, Kaby Lake has since been succeeded by Kaby Lake Refresh and Coffee Lake.  If you\u2019re thinking, \u201cWait, isn\u2019t Coffee Lake the name of Intel\u2019s 8th-generation architecture?\u201d, you would be right, although the Santa Clara chipmaker has come out and said that it plans on releasing three different CPU architectures under the 8th-gen umbrella, namely Kaby Lake Refresh, Coffee Lake and Cannon Lake.  If you\u2019re confused, you\u2019re not alone. Intel apparently had to \u201creimagine what \u2018generation\u2019 means\u201d, according to Tom\u2019s Hardware. Regardless, what you need to know here is that Kaby Lake Refresh is coming to laptops and Ultrabooks near you, while Coffee Lake is focused on desktops.  Cannon Lake, on the other hand, will be here later, most likely in the latter half of 2018.  Kaby Lake revealed CPUs  Outside of mobile, there are well over 20 Kaby Lake chips now on the market. From the Celeron G3930 to the Core i7-7700K, practically all the choices you had last generation are still present, albeit with better power efficiency and even a slight spec boost.  The Core i7-7700K is the flagship processor this time around, unlocked for overclocking as indicated by the discrete \"K\" moniker. Like the generations before it, the Kaby Lake architecture opts for a numerical naming convention: it consists of the \u201c7\u201d series CPUs to Skylake\u2019s generation 6, Broadwell\u2019s gen 5 and so on.  However, Intel is trying something with Kaby Lake that\u2019s practically unprecedented. By refreshing its 7th-generation processors with more cores, better clock speeds and improved graphics, the company has been able to create an entirely new generation out of its Kaby Lake processors as well, hence the Core i7-8550U being used in the new HP ProBooks .  As far as Intel\u2019s 7th-gen mobile processors are concerned, the most powerful lie in the \u201cH\u201d series, consisting mainly of the Intel Core i7-7700HQ and the Intel Core i7-7820HK. The former can be found in the 15-inch MacBook Pro while the latter is featured predominately in high-end gaming notebooks like the Alienware 17 R4 .  At Intel\u2019s low- to medium-power range, there\u2019s the Core i7-7500U, which initially leaked alongside the i7-7700K, but has since been found in the HP Spectre x360 as well as the Razer Blade Stealth . Intended for Ultrabooks on the top-end, this is a relatively high performance chipset, but still belongs to the \"U\" ultra-low voltage family.  Meanwhile, Intel\u2019s 8th-generation Kaby Lake processors marked the debut of quad-core processors for Ultrabooks. These include the top-end Intel Core i7-8550U, which operates at a base clock speed of 1.8GHz and a boost speed of 3.7GHz. As for the graphics, you can expect integrated UHD Graphics 620 from Intel.  Further on the mobile front, the higher-end Core m5 and m7 mobile chips of the past are now being interspersed into the Y-series Intel Core family. These include the Core m3-7Y30, the Core i5-7Y54 and the Core i7-7Y75, which are being used in top-end laptops with fanless and convertible designs to complement the more power-hungry U-series processors.  Many of Intel\u2019s 7th- and 8th-generation selections also support Optane, a memory technology that brings hard drive speeds up to par with that of SSDs.  Intel Kaby Lake first laptops  Where have these chipsets ended up? Well, they\u2019re currently featured in a long list of notebooks, several of which we\u2019ve already reviewed. The aforementioned Razer Blade Stealth and HP Spectre x360 are joined by the likes of the Lenovo Yoga 720 among many other Ultrabooks, 2-in-1s and full-on laptops.  The MacBook Pro , too, has been given the Kaby Lake treatment, though our review of that model is pending. Because the \u201cH\u201d series Kaby Lake processors typically used in the 15-inch MacBook Pros weren\u2019t available at the time of its release, Apple\u2019s late 2016 laptops were still clinging to Skylake up until being hastily refreshed at WWDC 2017 .  Other laptops equipped with Kaby Lake processors include the new 2-in-1 Dell Latitude 7285 featuring WiTricity magnetic wireless charging and the acclaimed Samsung Notebook 9 Pro convertible laptop. Plus, there are even more Kaby Lake-based laptops expected just around the corner, like the Surface Book 2 .  Intel Kaby Lake architecture  Cannonlake is likely to prove a much more exciting update than Kaby Lake and even Coffee Lake thereafter. You see, Kaby Lake is very similar to the Skylake family we're already using. This is not what we originally expected of the Skylake successor, but Intel has changed how its processor development works.  Since 2007, Intel has worked in a 'tick, tock' rhythm of upgrades, where one generation shrinks the die, followed by a generation that alters the architecture. That changed this year. As of 2016, Intel now uses a \"Process, Architecture, Optimization\" approach, and Kaby Lake represents that last, frankly least interesting stage.  It's still a 14nm processor that\u2019s fairly similar to Skylake throughout, and the desktop variants will use the same LGA 1151 socket. Unless something goes terribly wrong, Cannonlake will shrink Intel CPUs down to the long-promised 10nm die in 2018.  While there are some performance improvements in store, it seems unnecessary for those with a Skylake CPU to upgrade to a Kaby Lake processor of the same level. That said, there are more options this time around, with higher end Kaby Lake-X CPUs making an impression.  Intel Kaby Lake upgrades  Despite not being the most thrilling generation of processors, there are some distinct improvements that inhabit Intel\u2019s Kaby Lake CPUs. The first is fully integrated support for USB-C Gen 2. Skylake machines can offer this already, but need an extra third-party piece of hardware. Now, its \u201cnative\u201d. Again, not exciting, but it is necessary.  Gen 2 USB 3.1 enables bandwidth of 10Gbps, rather than 5Gbps. Thunderbolt 3 support is in, too. In a similar vein, HDCP 2.2 support is native in Kaby Lake. This digital copy protection is a newer version designed for certain 4K video standards. Ultra HD Blu-ray is the key one, though 4K Netflix on Windows 10 also requires a Kaby Lake processor.  That\u2019s right, Kaby Lake also offers integrated GPUs better-suited to 4K video. Thanks to a new media engine built on a Gen9 graphics architecture, users can edit real-time 4K video using nothing more than integrated graphics. For video consumption, the new VP9 and HVEC 10-bit decode will enable all-day 4K video streaming on a single charge.  And then to build on top of that dedication to better integrated GPUs, Intel has announced Kaby Lake G series CPUs that will feature integrated AMD Vega graphics to further push into a high-definition future.  Better yet, Intel\u2019s 8th-gen processors bring integrated UHD Graphics, designed to enhance the playback of 4K video. As a result, an Ultrabook using 8th-gen chips can display across three 4K monitors at once or even power a Windows Mixed Reality headset. It should also be noted that 8th-generation Kaby Lake processors are said to be 40% faster than their 7th-gen counterparts.  Kaby Lake only officially supports Windows 10 among Microsoft\u2019s operating systems. This is yet another attempt by Microsoft to push those lingering on Windows 7, or anything a little older, into the present.  Apollo Lake: Kaby Lake's poor cousin  It's also worth considering the low-end Atom chipsets you'll see used in very cheap laptops, Windows 10 tablets and low-power mini PCs Intel calls NUCs (Next Unit of Computing). Although they\u2019re not part of Kaby Lake, the latest \u201cApollo Lake\u201d chips started to appear in late November, with Asus and HP being among the first to implement them.  These, too, are capable of 4K video playback acceleration by way of the HEVC and VP9 codecs. This is due in part to the move from Gen 8 to the Gen 9 graphics found in Skylake processors.  Kaby Lake-X: a higher-end future  If you're only interested in mainstream Kaby Lake models, the future isn't looking too complicated. They're trickling out, before being replaced by Cannonlake CPUs in late 2018. However, the outlook for seriously high-end hardware is more convoluted.  As of a couple of months ago, the newest high-end CPUs were part of the Broadwell-E series, even though among mainstream processors Broadwell is already old news. But in June, Intel released its more powerful Skylake and Kaby Lake \u201cX\u201d series processors, the latter of which comes in two flavors:  4.0GHz quad-core Intel Core i5-7640X (up to 4.2GHz with Turbo Boost)  4.3GHz quad-core Intel Core i7-7740X (up to 4.5GHz with Turbo Boost)  Both of these bear TDP ratings of 112 Watts in addition to supporting quad-channel DDR4-2666 memory.

All three new types of product are designed to give Intel what it needs to deliver top-tier performance for every laptop price point, purpose and form factor \u2013 and based on Intel\u2019s promises and early hands-on time with several of these 8th-generation and Core i9 laptops, Intel seems well on its way to delivering.  Starting with the fun stuff, Intel Core i9 brings the firm\u2019s most powerful CPU into the mobile space. The one and only Core i9 processor is the i9-8950HK, clocked at 2.9GHz and maxing out at 4.8GHz across its six cores and 12 threads. The processor has a relatively massive 12MB cache, and is unlocked for overclocking.  Clearly, the idea with this processor is to bring desktop, hexa-core power to gaming laptops and prosumer devices. Laptops we\u2019ve seen already that possess this power include the Asus ROG G703, Aorus X9 DT and MSI GT75 Titan.  Image 1 of 13 Acer Aspire Nitro 5 \u2013 $749 (about \u00a3530, AU$980)  Sporting a faux carbon fiber lid, the Acer Nitro 5 will be one of the more affordable Intel 8th-gen H-series laptops available starting this month. Image 2 of 13 Acer Aspire 7 \u2013 $849 (about \u00a3600, AU$1,110)  Meanwhile, Acer's more business facing Aspire 7 brings the same level of performance to a more professional device plus higher-tier Nvidia GTX 1050 Ti graphics. Image 3 of 13 MSI GS65 Stealth \u2013 $1,799 (about \u00a31,280, AU$2,350)  The MSI GS65 is fresh, more minimalistic take on the brand's classic Stealth series featuring an even thinner chassis and smaller bezels. Image 4 of 13 MSI GT75 Titan \u2013 $2,399 (about \u00a31,710, AU$3,120)  On the opposite end of the portability equation, the MSI GT75 Titan is one of the first of three gaming laptops to feature an Intel Core i9 processor for true overclocking potential.  Image 5 of 13 Asus ZenBook Pro UX550  The Asus ZenBook Pro UX550 is one of the thinnest laptops that will features an H-series Coffee Lake processor  Image 6 of 13 Asus ROG G703  The Asus ROG G703 pairs up the new Intel Core i9-8950HK processor with Nvidia GTX 1080 for unparalleled performance in a gaming laptop. Image 7 of 13 Samsung Odyssey Z 15  The Samsung Odyssey Z 15 was one of the only wholy new gaming laptops we saw rocking Intel's new H-series Coffee Lake processors. Image 8 of 13 HP Omen 15  The HP Omen 15 is not only of the brands first laptops to feature a hexa-core Intel Core processor, but also a Nvidia GTX 1060 Max-Q GPU. Image 9 of 13 HP Omen 17  Featuring the same choices in processors, the HP Omen 17 also sports a larger 17.3-inch screen. Image 10 of 13 Gigabyte Aero 15X - $1,999 (about \u00a31,420, AU$2,610)  Sporting a new logo and 0.1-inch thinner design, the Gigabyte Aero 15X continues the series' tradition of being of the most affordable and potent gaming laptops in the world. Image 11 of 13 Aorus X9 DT - $2,599 (about \u00a31,850, AU$3,390)  The Aorus X9 DT is the last of the four laptops to feature Intel's Core i9 processor and to top it off this gaming laptop is equipped with a real mechanical keyboard and Nvidia GTX 1080 graphics.

The TUF FX504 will be available from the end of April in Australia only, for the time being. Image 13 of 13 (Image: \u00a9 Joel Burgess) MSI GE73 Raider - 1060 FHD AU$2,799 (about $1,529 US$2,149) The update to MSI\u2019s competitively priced GE gaming laptops, sees the full range of 17-inch models updated with new Core i7 mobile processors. All models are now available for pre-order globally.  Better performance for all  Unlike the laser focus on enthusiast gaming of Core i9 on mobile, Intel looks for its Coffee Lake H- and U-series to improve upon the experiences of all gamers and general users, respectively.  The H series of Intel Core processors brings hexa-core design to Intel Core i7 chips for the first time in the i7-8850H with a 2.6GHz clock speed that boosts to 4.3GHz when needed with a 9MB cache in tow. These hexa-core CPUs should make managing multiple units in strategy and other similar games much more efficient.  Intel\u2019s Coffee Lake U-series, however, simply doubles down on the power of 8th-gen Kaby Lake R with more quad-core chips that range in clock speed from 2.3GHz to 3.0GHz and cache size from 4MB to 8MB. By Intel\u2019s measure using a Core i5-8400U processor, this chip is 2.5x more responsive and 2.1x faster in office productivity tasks than a five-year-old system. The new U-series also integrates updated Iris Plus graphics.  To make those gains feel even greater, Intel has brought its Optane high-speed memory to laptops through both direct Optane SSDs, like the Optane SSD 800p, as well as Optane hybrid drives for disk drives paired with SSDs. According to Intel, the gains amount to 1.3x performance improvement in data writing and retrieval-related tasks, and 4.7x faster level loading in games.  Intel hasn\u2019t laid out pricing expectations for any products containing these new processors or storage improvements, leaving that up to individual device makers. Expect to see laptops with these new processors inside laptops priced from around $500 / \u00a3400 / AU$650 starting very soon.", "stock": "INTC", "label": 1, "date": "2018-04-03", "source": "techradar", "url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/intel-core-i9-coffee-lake-and-optane-all-about-intels-newest-processors-for-laptops"}, {"article": "Dell absolutely delivers on bringing the full power of Intel\u2019s new processors to its premium laptop, pairing it with strong graphics to challenge Apple\u2019s domain in the 15-inch space.  The latest Dell XPS 15 is all about bringing the power of Intel H series and Core i9 processors to a laptop thin as an Ultrabook . In that regard, Dell absolutely delivers, enabling specifications with serious power available in a thin and light, 14-inch laptop frame.  Naturally, that frame houses a 15.6-inch InfinityEdge touch display with barely-there bezels \u2013 this and more going for a price that ought to give Apple pause. While we\u2019re holding full judgment until a full review, things are looking up for Dell\u2019s supersized XPS laptop of 2018.  Price and availability  Dell will start selling the new XPS 15 this May at a decent price of $999 (about \u00a3949, AU$1,299). That starting price includes an 8th-generation Intel Kaby Lake Core i5-8300H processor that runs up to 4.0GHz, paired with an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 graphics card with 4GB of GDDR5 video memory.  Those both power a 15.6-inch FHD (1,920 x 1,080) InfinityEdge display that\u2019s just around 14 inches wide. The anti-glare screen meets 100% sRGB, sports a 1,200:1 contrast ratio, shines at 400 nits, has IPS for 178-degree wide viewing angles. This display can be upgraded to a 4K Ultra HD (3,840 x 2,160) InfinityEdge touch display with a juiced up contrast ratio.  Likewise, the graphics can be upgraded to GTX 1050 Ti, and the processor to an Intel Core i7-8750H at 4.1GHz or even an Intel Core i9 CPU, to keep pace with that sharper display.  As for memory and storage, the XPS 15 comes with 8GB of DDR4 RAM to start and can be upgraded to 32GB, meanwhile starting storage comes in at a 128GB SSD + 1TB HDD. From there, you have 256GB PCIe NMVe SSD, 1TB solid state hybrid drive, 512GB PCIe NMVe SSD and 1TB PCIe NMVe SSD options.  Of course, prices for all of these upgrades are unknown at this time. However, all models will feature widescreen HD (720p) webcams with dual array digital microphones, as well as the following connectivity options: one Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C), two USB 3.1 Gen 1, one HDMI 2.0, an SD card reader (SD, SDHC, SDXC), a headset jack, Killer 1535 802.11ac (2 x 2 MIMO) Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.1 radios.

Of course, that includes a brushed aluminum lid and base that surround a soft-touch carbon fiber keyboard deck.  That keyboard deck feels as plush as usual and houses the same Dell keyboard you\u2019ve come to love, so expect deep enough travel and strong feedback.  The display, whether in 1080p or 4K, looks fantastically sharp and bright and is nearly bezel-less. Of course, this has driven the webcam into Dell\u2019s now-classic \u2018Chin Cam\u2019 position \u2013 not that rivals like Huawei MateBook X Pro have done much better.  All told, the XPS 15 accomplishes quite a lot for a laptop that\u2019s just 0.66 inches (17mm) thick and weighs just 4 pounds (1.8kg).  Performance  We anticipate that the available processor options will allow this laptop to gobble all basic computing tasks up for breakfast. That said, we don\u2019t expect Core i9 to entice the XPS 15 core audience. Rather data crunchers and extreme Excel users might find the most use out of the hexa-core CPU.  Given the high-premium the Intel Core i9 chip places on other laptops like the MSI GT75 Titan, we can expect the highest end version of the Dell XPS 15 to be as equally as expensive.  That said, Dell promises a battery life goal of 21 and a half hours with the XPS 15. Perhaps that\u2019s possible with the 1080p model, but we\u2019ll believe it when we see it.  At any rate, it\u2019s easy to expect some pretty impressive performance even from the entry-level XPS 15, especially for the price to start.  Early verdict  The new-and-improved Dell XPS 15 really takes the performance factor to the next level with Intel\u2019s latest H series processors and Core i9 mega-tasking capability paired with strong Nvidia graphics. Even at its starting price, you\u2019re looking at quite the rival to Apple\u2019s 15-inch MacBook Pro.  For the money, the XPS 15 looks like it\u2019s going to turn quite a few heads when it lands this May in stores and online.

At the time, they were billed as an evolution of the previous, 7th-generation chips, bringing quad-core designs to the i5 line and therefore more power.  However, these chips have also been said to boost efficiency when it comes to power consumption.  That said, let\u2019s say you\u2019re at the local computer store. In an aisle littered with choices, you\u2019ve narrowed it down to one laptop, but there are two models side-by-side. One is housing an Intel Core i7 Kaby Lake (last year\u2019s 7th-generation) processor, and another a Core i7 Kaby Lake R (this year\u2019s 8th-generation).  With the chance to save, say, $100 (or \u00a3100) in this case, how much more would you really be getting out of that most up-to-date model to make that extra cost worthwhile?  We\u2019ve tested this real-life dilemma with three versions of the same Acer Swift 3 laptop \u2013 one with a 7th-gen Intel Core i5, one with an 8th-gen Intel Core i5 and one with that same chip and Nvidia MX150 graphics installed \u2013 to demonstrate.  As it turns out, the differences are rather striking in some areas and rather negligible in others.  Performance Benchmarks PCMark 8 Home  7th-gen Core i5: 2,791  8th-gen Core i5: 3,278  8th-gen Core i5 (MX150): 3,203 Geekbench 4  7th-gen Core i5: 3,911 Single-Core; 7,654 Multi-Core  8th-gen Core i5: 4,168 Single-Core; 14,009 Multi-Core  8th-gen Core i5 (MX150): 3,994 Single-Core; 13,557 Multi-Core Cinebench  7th-gen Core i5: 327 CPU; 49 Graphics  8th-gen Core i5: 530 CPU; 52 Graphics  8th-gen Core i5 (MX150): 512 CPU; 90 Graphics CPU-Z  7th-gen Core i5: 324.3 Single-Thread; 925.8 Multi-Thread  8th-gen Core i5: 402.7 Single-Thread; 1993.2 Multi-Thread  8th-gen Core i5 (MX150): 397.4 Single-Thread; 1928.4 Multi-Thread  Performance  When it comes to pure computing power output, there\u2019s little doubt that the 8th generation of Intel Core is stronger than the 7th. For instance, we see here that the 8th gen all but spanks the previous in Geekbench 4\u2019s multi-core CPU test.  The same is made obvious by our Cinebench and CPU-Z benchmark results: the leap from dual-core in the 7th generation to quad-core in the 8th generation is enormous.  In practical use, an 8th-gen machine will render multiple streams of data far faster than the previous generation, so expect smoother video and complex image editing from such a device.  However, we\u2019ve noticed interesting differences between the 8th-gen model without Nvidia graphics and the one that\u2019s housing an MX150 graphics chip.  In almost all of these aforementioned tests, the model without dedicated graphics outperformed the one with Nvidia graphics.  According to Intel, these differences amount to \u2018unit-to-unit variations\u2019 within a margin of error of 2% to 3%.  All in all, we\u2019re seeing a 17% (in PCMark 8 Home) to an 83% (in Geekbench 4) to as much as a 115% (in CPU-Z) increase in throughput between generations. That\u2019s certainly nothing to scoff at for a difference in price of 100 to 200 bills.  Battery Benchmarks PCMark 8 Battery Life  7th-gen Core i5: 4 hours and 25 minutes  8th-gen Core i5: 4 hours and 26 minutes  8th-gen Core i5 (MX150): 4 hours and 14 minutes TechRadar Battery Test  7th-gen Core i5: 6 hours and 58 minutes  8th-gen Core i5: 7 hours and 25 minutes  8th-gen Core i5 (MX150): 7 hours and 32 minutes  Battery life  That said, when it comes to longevity, the latest Intel processors don\u2019t enjoy nearly as incredible of an increase, but it\u2019s at least a boost. In short, don\u2019t expect all-day battery life just because you splurged on the model with the latest processor.  In the PCMark 8 Battery Life test, we\u2019re seeing gains so small that they\u2019re within the margin of error (and proof that dedicated graphics a long-lasting laptop does not make).  In our local video playback test, however, the 8th-gen model lasted nearly 30 minutes longer, while the one with Nvidia graphics lasted more than 30 minutes longer.  Of course, Intel never made a big stink about increases in lasting power when it rolled out Kaby Lake R late last year.  Just don\u2019t splurge on an 8th-generation Intel Core processor within a laptop model versus one with the previous version on account of battery life solely.  So, how much better is Kaby Lake R?  Unsurprisingly, 8th-generation Intel Core, or Kaby Lake R, is better than the previous generation Intel Core processors by just about every measure. However, those improvements come in varying levels of magnitude, with battery life gains being the smallest.  It\u2019s difficult for us to say that you\u2019re going to be massively rewarded for spending that extra scratch to get the latest-and-greatest, 8th-gen version of a given laptop you\u2019ve been eying. Frankly, because you\u2019re not: in real-world use, and for most users, you\u2019re not going to see a world of difference.  But, for those who work in rendering video or complex imagery with layers a la Photoshop, it most definitely pays to go quad-core if you can swing it.

Qualcomm and Apple have been in a bitter licensing dispute and Apple lately has switched to Intel chips in a portion of its devices. Should Broadcom succeed in buying Qualcomm, it could smooth over relations with Apple, closing a door to further possible gains from Intel.  A Broadcom deal would be Intel\u2019s biggest acquisition by far\u2014and should it pursue one, there is no guarantee regulators would bless it. Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., and with a market value of nearly $240 billion, has been acquisitive in recent years as it looks to diversify away from its core business of powering the personal-computer industry, which is in decline.  Last year, Intel bought Israeli car-camera pioneer Mobileye NV for roughly $15.3 billion in a bet on connected cars. In 2015, it struck its largest deal ever when it bought Altera Corp. for $16.7 billion. Intel hoped that buying Altera, a maker of programmable chips, would help bolster its position in server systems and other equipment found in data centers and telecommunications networks, the company said at the time, as well as fuel its plans surrounding the so-called Internet of Things.  In the most recent piece of drama surrounding Broadcom\u2019s bid to buy Qualcomm, the effort was dealt a setback when the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or CFIUS, indicated it has concerns about the takeover and would review it.  That appeared to lengthen the odds that Broadcom and its chief executive, Hock Tan, would succeed in their pursuit of Qualcomm, which has rejected the $117 billion offer as too low.  Separately, Qualcomm has in place its own pending $44 billion deal to buy NXP Semiconductors NV, which it sweetened in February, a move Broadcom criticized.  Qualcomm and Broadcom unleashed dueling announcements Friday as each sought to win support from regulators and shareholders during the takeover fight.  Qualcomm, looking to assert its board\u2019s independence, said Paul Jacobs would no longer be executive chairman. Mr. Jacobs, the son of Qualcomm co-founder Irwin Jacobs, will remain on the board. Current board member Jeffrey Henderson was named nonexecutive chairman.  Broadcom has been seeking to replace a majority of Qualcomm\u2019s board members to help pave the way for a deal. A vote on the directors that was slated to take place this past Tuesday at Qualcomm\u2019s annual meeting was pushed back a month at CFIUS\u2019s behest.  Broadcom, meanwhile, pledged that if it succeeds in acquiring its target, it wouldn\u2019t sell \u201cany critical national security assets to any foreign companies.\u201d The assurance was a nod to U.S. concerns that a takeover could weaken Qualcomm\u2019s position\u2014and therefore the country\u2019s standing\u2014as a leader in developing next-generation 5G cellular technology.  Broadcom late Friday said it will ask shareholders to vote March 23 to approve the company\u2019s plan to redomicile from Singapore to the U.S., potentially setting the stage for a showdown with CFIUS as the vote would take place in the middle of the panel\u2019s review of Broadcom\u2019s bid.  If Broadcom were considered a U.S. company, its acquisition would arguably fall outside of the panel\u2019s jurisdiction, though CFIUS could say it still has jurisdiction to review the bid since it began the review while Broadcom was a Singapore company.  Should Broadcom fail in its bid for Qualcomm, it is possible Intel would stand down, happy with the status quo.  Underlying the maneuvering is a battle among chip companies to be the chief supplier of critical cellular components to smartphone makers such as Apple and Samsung Electronics Co.  Qualcomm is a leader in chips that run apps and manage cellular communications in smartphones. It competes with Broadcom in chips for short-range wireless networking, including Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, and radio filters and other chips that condition cellular signals.  Intel, which dominates the market for the calculating engines in personal computers and data-center servers, missed the mobile revolution when its chips proved too power-hungry for battery-dependent cellphones. But Intel\u2019s cellular communications chips lately have displaced Qualcomm\u2019s in a portion of Apple\u2019s iPhones, and the company has been moving aggressively to develop that product line.  Acquiring Broadcom would give Intel a suite of smartphone chips, adding to its own communications chips the Singapore-based company\u2019s radio filters as well as Bluetooth and GPS components.  Broadcom sells a diverse line of equipment for networking and communications\u2014including technology for smartphones from Apple and Samsung\u2014as well as data storage, electronic displays and set-top boxes. Broadcom, like Qualcomm, is a so-called fabless chip company, designing processors while relying on manufacturers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to actually make them.  Under Mr. Tan, Broadcom has pursued a string of acquisitions. The company was formed when Avago Technologies Ltd. in 2015 agreed to buy the former Broadcom for roughly $37 billion and kept its name. Broadcom\u2019s revenue was twice the size of Avago\u2019s at the time of the merger.

INTC -1.63% reported record growth in fourth-quarter revenue as sales in its data-center business jumped 20%, while the company swung to a quarterly loss as it booked a $5.4 billion charge after recent changes in U.S. tax law.  Overall revenue rose 4% to $17.05 billion. Intel reported a $687 million loss, compared with a profit of $3.56 billion a year earlier, largely because of the tax impact.  The company said it expects a 2018 tax rate of 14%, compared with an adjusted rate of 23% in 2017, which doesn\u2019t account for the tax impact.  The chip giant also announced a 10% rise in its annual dividend to $1.20 a share.  Sales in the division responsible for server chips and other data-center gear\u2014a critical area as personal-computer sales wane\u2014climbed to $5.6 billion. That pushed full-year growth in the segment to 11%, above Intel\u2019s goal of high single-digit growth for 2017.  In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Intel finance chief Bob Swan attributed the growth to demand from cloud vendors and communications networks, as well as surprisingly strong sales to corporate data centers, which had been sluggish.  \u201cWe saw strong customer demand for high-performance products across the board,\u201d he said. He cautioned, however, he doesn\u2019t expect the rising pace of sales to corporate customers to continue.  Intel\u2019s report Thursday came as the company continues to work on closing recently disclosed security holes in virtually all its processors.  The company has said that it doesn\u2019t expect the security flaws to affect its finances, but questions linger about just how seriously customers are affected, especially those that operate large data centers, and what redress they might demand. At the outset of the company\u2019s conference call with analysts, Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said Intel is working around the clock to fix the flaws, but conceded that \u201cwhile we\u2019ve made progress, I am acutely aware that we have more to do.\u201d  In the personal-computer division, where Intel faces stepped up competition from Advanced Micro Devices Inc., sales fell 2%, in line with the quarter\u2019s drop in PC shipments tallied by industry researcher Gartner Inc.  Intel has been trimming costs to keep margins up as it transitions from PCs to a broader technology portfolio. It has pledged to bring annual operating expenses to 30% of revenue by 2020. In the quarter, it cut those costs to 31% of revenue, compared with 34% in the year-earlier period and averaging 33.7% for the year.  The company also posted strong growth in some areas where it has been seeking to expand its market, though the businesses for now are much smaller than PC and data-center chips.  Sales of programmable chips, which can be reconfigured on the fly, were up 35%, while sales of chips for a variety of items known as the Internet of Things, were up 21%. Memory, where Intel is investing heavily, achieved profitability, Intel said, though sales growth slowed to 9%, a slightly steeper drop than some analysts expected.  Intel shares were up 3.5% after hours, having fallen 0.5% to $45.30 in regular New York trading. Through Thursday\u2019s close, the stock was up 29% since late July, when surging second-quarter revenue and profit sparked investor confidence that the company could overcome its challenges.  The company\u2019s forecast for the current year was for profit of about $3.55 a share on an adjusted basis, on revenue of about $65 billion, compared with $3.46 a share in adjusted profit and $62.8 billion in revenue for 2017.  Intel reported per-share earnings of $1.08 for the quarter on an adjusted basis, which excludes the tax-law impact and other items such as restructuring and acquisition-related costs.

And Qualcomm\u2019s own proposed purchase of Dutch automotive chip specialist NXP Semiconductors NV would turbocharge such a merger in the automotive market, where Intel has placed one of its biggest bets.  \u201cYou\u2019d have this powerhouse going up against you,\u201d said analyst Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein Research, noting the combined revenue of Broadcom and Qualcomm\u2014nearly $40 billion in fiscal 2017\u2014would be formidable even relative to Intel\u2019s $63 billion in the same year. Nonetheless, he finds an Intel-Broadcom merger unlikely.  There are several reasons why such a combination may not happen. Intel is weighing a range of alternative acquisitions, the Journal reported Friday, and a hostile Broadcom offer would present enormous challenges of financing, complexity and regulatory scrutiny.  Intel has made relatively few big deals in its 49-year history\u2014the largest was in 2015 when it acquired Altera Corp. for $16.7 billion\u2014and it has previously had a spotty track record of folding them in.  Intel in a statement said its focus is on integrating its recent purchases and \u201cmaking them successful for our customers and shareholders.\u201d The company declined to comment further.  An Intel-Broadcom tie-up may not even make sense in terms of strengthening Intel, according to some analysts. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any benefit to Intel,\u201d said Handel Jones, a consultant at International Business Strategies. In particular, he said, Broadcom\u2019s products wouldn\u2019t mesh well with Intel\u2019s manufacturing operations, where the chip giant could use additional volume to reduce costs.  But the prospect that Intel could bid for Broadcom reflects tectonic forces reshaping the semiconductor industry as chips make their way into all manner of consumer and industrial products, from smart speakers to urban infrastructure.  Intel, with a market capitalization of about $243 billion, holds over a 90% share in its core markets of processor chips in personal computers and data-center servers, according to Mercury Research, leaving it scant room to grow in those areas as PC shipments continue their persistent decline.  Intel has responded, in part, by moving aggressively into cellular communications chips, where it has replaced Qualcomm units in a portion of Apple Inc.\u2019s iPhones and made inroads with the next-generation 5G cellular specification.  It has advanced into the automotive industry with its $15.3 billion purchase of Mobileye NV, a leader in sensors for assisted-driving features like automated lane keeping and collision avoidance.  And it has doubled down on its data-center business, supplying companies like Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. that are spending tens of billions annually on hyperscale cloud-computing facilities.  Hitching Broadcom, whose management style has driven a sevenfold increase in its share price over five years, to Qualcomm, whose products form the bedrock of the mobile market, could threaten Intel\u2019s progress in all three areas.  Broadcom declined to comment. Qualcomm didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.  Qualcomm has focused on developing key cellular technology, playing a leadership role in 5G. That research keeps its chips ahead of the competition, and it has resulted in a patent portfolio that yields a royalty on nearly every smartphone sold, whether or not they contain Qualcomm chips\u2014a revenue stream that typically provides most of Qualcomm\u2019s pretax profit.  Since early 2017, though, Qualcomm has been in a bitter legal war with Apple over its royalty rates, which the iPhone maker alleges are unfair. Qualcomm hasn\u2019t been able to resolve the conflict quickly, and Apple is considering replacing Qualcomm chips entirely with products from rivals including Intel.  Broadcom also sells chips to Apple, and its chief executive, Hock Tan, claims to have a strong relationship with the iPhone maker. If Broadcom takes over Qualcomm, he believes he could resolve the Apple dispute. In that case, Apple could boost Qualcomm\u2019s presence in iPhones at Intel\u2019s expense, especially as 5G ramps up in coming years.  A combined Broadcom-Qualcomm also could wreak havoc on Intel\u2019s ambitions in self-driving cars. Qualcomm\u2019s acquisition of NXP awaits antitrust approval in China, its final regulatory hurdle, which Qualcomm has said it expects soon. Completing the purchase would pave the way for Qualcomm\u2019s 5G chips and self-driving tech. The extra heft that Broadcom would give that combination could create a counterweight to Intel and Mobileye.  Broadcom also sells switches to makers of data-center equipment, while Qualcomm is pushing into data centers with server processors that compete directly with Intel\u2019s. The prospect of selling Qualcomm\u2019s server chips through Broadcom\u2019s data-center channels may give Intel pause.  And Mr. Tan likely wouldn\u2019t stop there. He built Broadcom on a string of ever bolder acquisitions. Having rolled up Qualcomm\u2014if his takeover effort gets that far\u2014he could continue to enlarge his portfolio of market-leading franchises, potentially blocking Intel\u2019s efforts at every turn.  \u2014Dana Mattioli  and Dana Cimilluca contributed to this article.

Intel\u2019s decision to inform Chinese technology companies about security flaws in its processors raises concerns that the information could have reached the Chinese government before being publicly divulged. Photo: steinba/EPA/Shutterstock  In initial disclosures about critical security flaws discovered in its processors, Intel Corp. INTC -1.63% notified a small group of customers, including Chinese technology companies, but left out the U.S. government, according to people familiar with the matter and some of the companies involved.  The decision raises concerns, security researchers said, as it potentially could have allowed information about the chip flaws, dubbed Spectre and Meltdown, to fall into the hands of the Chinese government before being publicly divulged. There is no evidence any information was misused, the researchers said.  Weeks after word of the flaws first surfaced, Intel\u2019s choices about who would receive advance warning continue to ripple through the security and tech industries.  The flaws were first identified in June by a member of Google\u2019s Project Zero security team. Intel had planned to make the discovery public on Jan. 9\u2014people working to protect systems from hacks often hold off on announcements while fixes are devised\u2014but sped up its timetable when the news became widely known on Jan. 3, a day after U.K. website the Register wrote about the flaws.  Because the flaws can be leveraged to sneak sensitive data out of the cloud, information about them would be of great interest to any intelligence-gathering agency, said Jake Williams, president of the security company Rendition Infosec LLC and a former National Security Agency employee. In the past, Chinese state-linked hackers have exploited software vulnerabilities to get leverage on their targets or expand surveillance.  It is a \u201cnear certainty\u201d Beijing was aware of the conversations between Intel and its Chinese tech partners, because authorities there routinely monitor all such communications, Mr. Williams said.  Representatives from China\u2019s ministry in charge of information technology didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. The country\u2019s foreign ministry has in the past said it is \u201cresolutely opposed\u201d to cyberhacking in any form.  An Intel spokesman declined to identify the companies it briefed before the scheduled Jan. 9 announcement. The company wasn\u2019t able to tell everyone it had planned to, including the U.S. government, because the news was made public earlier than expected, he said.  Intel\u2019s tricky path\u2014inform enough big customers to head off significant damage while keeping the information as contained as possible to limit potential leaks\u2014continues to weigh on smaller companies that weren\u2019t given an early nod.  Joyent Inc., a U.S.-based cloud-services provider owned by Samsung Electronics Co. , is still playing catch-up, said Bryan Cantrill, the company\u2019s chief technology officer.  \u201cOther folks had a six-month head start,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re scrambling.\u201d  In the months before the flaws were publicly disclosed, Intel worked on fixes with Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google unit as well as \u201ckey\u201d computer makers and cloud-computing companies, Intel said in an emailed statement to The Wall Street Journal.  An official at the Department of Homeland Security said staffers learned of the chip flaws from the Jan. 3 news reports. The department is often informed of bug discoveries in advance of the public, and it acts as an authoritative source for information on how to address them.  \u201cWe certainly would have liked to have been notified of this,\u201d the official said.  The NSA was similarly in the dark, according to Rob Joyce, the White House\u2019s top cybersecurity official. In a message posted Jan. 13 to Twitter, he said the NSA \u201cdid not know about these flaws.\u201d A White House spokesman declined to comment further, referring instead to the tweet.  Chinese computer maker Lenovo Group Ltd. LNVGY -0.87% was among the large tech companies, including Microsoft Corp. , Amazon.com Inc. and ARM Holdings in the U.K., that were notified of the flaws beforehand.  Lenovo was able to issue a statement Jan. 3 advising customers on the flaws because of \u201cthe work we\u2019d done ahead of that date with industry processor and operating system partners,\u201d a spokeswoman said in an email.  Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA -2.21% , China\u2019s top seller of cloud-computing services, also was notified ahead of time, according to a person familiar with the company.  A spokeswoman for Alibaba\u2019s cloud unit declined to comment on when the company was informed. She said any idea that the company might have shared information with Chinese authorities was \u201cspeculative and baseless.\u201d  A Lenovo spokeswoman said Intel\u2019s information was protected by a nondisclosure agreement.  Despite the security concerns, an early heads up to a select number of large global companies made sense, said Dave Aitel, chief executive of Immunity Inc., a company that sells security services. \u201cThey\u2019re going to tell as few people as possible\u201d to contain possible leaks, he said.  Because they had early warning, Microsoft, Google and Amazon were able to release statements soon after news of the flaws leaked out saying their cloud-computing customers were largely protected.  Smaller competitors, though, continue to struggle. DigitalOcean Inc., a cloud-services seller, said Jan. 19 it was still testing a fix for its customers. Rackspace Inc. said last Wednesday it has several teams working on a fix. The cloud company earlier in January told customers it understood the situation \u201ccan be frustrating.\u201d  The DHS also stumbled with its initial guidance. The agency\u2019s Computer Emergency Response Team first linked to an advisory stating the only way to \u201cfully remove\u201d the flaws was by replacing the chip. CERT now advises users instead to patch their systems.  The DHS should have been looped in early on to help coordinate the flaws\u2019 disclosure, Joyent\u2019s Mr. Cantrill said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why CERT would not be your first stop,\u201d he said.

SES SA said it will join Intelsat SA\u2019s I 2.02% campaign to keep serving U.S. customers in a chunk of the C-band, a swath of airwaves in the middle of the broader radio spectrum, while allowing other wireless operators to take over a smaller sliver of the band. The companies said they serve about 90% of the U.S. market in the C-band, which media companies use to beam video to cable companies for distribution.  The success of the satellite companies\u2019 proposal, also backed by computer chip maker Intel Corp. INTC -1.63% , will affect how quickly the U.S. adopts fifth-generation, or 5G networks. Several telecom companies are jostling for increasingly scarce spectrum licenses that could support connected cars, medical equipment and other gear that would be constantly connected to the wireless network.  The plan could still face opposition from wireless carriers that would prefer to move all satellite operators off the band entirely. Satellite companies have said that is a non-starter.  \u201cIt would not really be feasible to say, \u2019Hey move to another band, we\u2019re using this now,\u2019\u201d Intelsat Chief Executive Steve Spengler said in an interview. \u201cSatellite operators have built satellites specifically for this. There\u2019s a huge investment that\u2019s already in place today.\u201d  The focus now shifts to the Federal Communications Commission. The agency has yet to launch a rule-making process for the spectrum but is expected to start in the coming months.

If the plan succeeds or the FCC auctions off all of the spectrum, there will likely be plenty of takers.  A much-maligned pitch for a new government-backed 5G network focused heavily on the C-band. The proposal\u2019s authors argued it was the broadest and most useful radio frequency available to U.S. policy makers looking to jump-start 5G infrastructure investment.  Government officials quickly disavowed that plan, which included an idea for a nationalized government-run network, but the band is still the subject of intense private-sector interest.  \u201cIt really is the sweet spot for wireless operators to think about,\u201d said Tim Farrar, a telecom analyst at industry research TMF Associates.

Committee Chairman Devin Nunes owes ranking Democrat Adam Schiff a thank you for assisting his case.  The 10-page Democratic memo begins by declaring that \u201cThe FBI and DOJ officials did not \u2018abuse\u2019 the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) process, omit material information, or subvert this vital tool to spy on the Trump campaign.\u201d Yet the facts it lays out show the opposite.  In particular the memo confirms that the FBI used an opposition-research document paid for by the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee as part of its application to surveil Carter Page, who was associated with the Donald Trump campaign.  Democrats dispute the degree to which the FBI relied on the dossier created by opposition-researcher Christopher Steele in applying for its FISA court order, but that\u2019s beside the point. If the FBI had as much \u201ccompelling evidence\u201d and \u201cprobable cause\u201d as the memo asserts, it would not have needed to cite the Steele document. And the Democrats do not dispute that the Steele dossier was the FBI\u2019s only source in its initial FISA application for its allegation that Mr. Page met with suspect Russians in Moscow in July 2016.  The Democratic memo makes no attempt to rebut the widely reported news that former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe told Congress that the FBI would not have sought a surveillance warrant without the dossier. Democratic Rep. Jim Himes claimed on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that Mr. McCabe never said that, but then why not put that in the memo?  The Democratic memo also confirms that the FBI withheld from the court the partisan provenance of the dossier. Democrats even provide, for the first time in public, the precise language the FBI used in its initial application in a long, obfuscating footnote.  Democrats say the FBI told the FISA court that a \u201claw firm\u201d [Clinton/DNC firm Perkins Coie] hired \u201can identified U.S. person\u201d [oppo-research firm Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson ] to \u201cconduct research regarding Candidate #1s ties to Russia.\u201d The \u201cidentified U.S. person\u201d then hired \u201cSource #1\u201d [Mr. Steele] to do the research. The footnote ends: \u201cThe FBI speculates that the identified U.S. person was likely looking for information that could be used to discredit Candidate #1\u2019s campaign.\u201d  Speculates? Likely? Could? The dossier was paid for by actors whose overriding purpose was to defeat Mr. Trump. Nowhere do Democrats say the FBI used the words \u201cpolitical\u201d or \u201cpartisan\u201d or \u201ccampaign,\u201d much less Clinton or Democratic National Committee.  The Democratic memo claims the FBI acted \u201cappropriately\u201d in not \u201crevealing\u201d the name of an \u201centity\u201d in a FISA application, but this is laughable. The FBI sometimes masks identities to preserve sources and methods, but the Steele dossier was a pastiche of gossip and rumor based on Mr. Steele\u2019s contacts. Disclosing his partisan funders would have betrayed no important intelligence sources but would have given the court reason to ask the FBI for more credible information before granting an eavesdrop order.  Messrs. Steele and Simpson briefed their media friends in September and October about their dossier, despite FBI prohibitions. The FBI nonetheless falsely told the court that Mr. Steele wasn\u2019t the source of a Yahoo News article that it used as additional evidence in its application. While the Democratic memo repeatedly refers to Mr. Steele\u2019s reporting as \u201creliable\u201d and \u201ccredible,\u201d it confirms that the FBI fired Mr. Steele after it found he hadn\u2019t told the truth about his media spinning.  The Democratic memo devotes considerable space to smearing the hapless Mr. Page, as if he\u2019s some kind of master spy and the Rosetta Stone of the Trump-Russia story. Yet no one has offered proof that he colluded with the Russians, and he hasn\u2019t been indicted.  Democrats also make much of the fact the FBI started looking into the Trump campaign in July 2016 but didn\u2019t receive \u201cSteele\u2019s reporting\u201d until \u201cmid-September.\u201d So what? The issue here is the fairness and honesty of the FISA application in late October (not the investigation), and what matters is that the FBI didn\u2019t move on the FISA application until after it received the dossier.  ***  The only definitive evidence of political \u201ccollusion\u201d so far is that the Clinton campaign paid Mr. Steele to troll his Russian sources for dirt on Donald Trump. The FBI then used this dirt as a reason to spy on Mr. Page and anyone he was communicating with.

WSJ's David Pierce has a few tricks and tips to pull yourself back into the real world. Photo/Video: Emily Prapuolenis/The Wall Street Journal  When smartphones came to steal our attention, we never had a chance. Even in the rare moments we manage to put them down, they buzz incessantly, begging us to come back.  It\u2019s fine for phones to be engrossing when we\u2019re bored on a layover. More often they should help us work or exercise or find a Starbucks , then get out of the way.  Now, more than a decade into the smartphone era, investors, activists and customers alike have begun to push phone makers, especially Apple Inc., AAPL 0.34% to find a way to solve phone addiction.  The feature we need already exists: It\u2019s called Do Not Disturb. Whether you use an iPhone or an Android device, you have a one-tap way to shut your phone up. Do Not Disturb should be every smartphone user\u2019s best friend and saving grace. Instead, it\u2019s a relic of a long-gone era, a feature that doesn\u2019t work the way we do.  The iPhone\u2019s \u2018Do Not Disturb\u2019 feature shuts off nearly everything. You can engage it manually or schedule your silence ahead of time. Photo: David Pierce/The Wall Street Journal  Apple launched Do Not Disturb in 2012 to keep your phone from waking you up in the middle of the night. When you tap the moon icon, your phone instantly shuts up. Your notifications are visible if you wake up your phone, but it won\u2019t buzz or light up automatically. There are only small nuances: You can name contacts who can call you\u2014no texts get through when Do Not Disturb is engaged\u2014or allow anyone who calls twice to buzz through on the second call.  Last year, the company launched Do Not Disturb While Driving, which engages when your phone connects to your car stereo or its motion sensors detect driving. It allows alarms and timers\u2014and Apple Maps navigation\u2014but generally keeps the screen dark. Anyone who messages you can receive an automatic response.  The problem is that this dichotomy\u2014you\u2019re either on or off, zero or 100\u2014doesn\u2019t actually represent how people use their phones. When you\u2019re sleeping, you might want total quiet. But what about at work, when you\u2019re still reachable but trying to focus on your presentation instead of incessant ESPN updates? Or when the people you care most about would rather use WhatsApp or Snapchat, instead of calling you? Turning on Do Not Disturb is like taking your landline phone off the hook to keep it from ringing.  Apple\u2019s \u2018Do Not Disturb While Driving\u2019 allows you to auto-respond to texts so your friends won\u2019t wonder why you\u2019re not replying. Photo: David Pierce/The Wall Street Journal  Do Not Disturb should have a sort of volume meter, from 0 to 10. When you\u2019re bored on the couch, turn the knob all the way up and let the distracting notifications flow. When you\u2019re asleep go to 0: silence is golden. In between, users ought to be able to control what gets through and when.  At work you need buzzes for your calendar, email and Slack, but would rather not have Candy Crush luring you back in before lunchtime. There should be an \u201cI\u2019m in a meeting\u201d setting, and a \u201cGet me out of this meeting\u201d one, too.  Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google does this better. Android\u2019s Do Not Disturb, launched in 2014, has a Total Silence mode, but also offers Priority Mode. With that engaged, only the apps you\u2019ve handpicked can buzz your phone. My friends can message me on all the apps I use, but Starbucks can\u2019t tell me about deals, and Twitter can\u2019t suck me back into my timeline. Android also allows you to let calendar notifications or reminders through the Do Not Disturb wall.  Google could do more; Apple could do much more. Users should be able to set their own rules. Studies have shown that when people reduce notifications, they worry they\u2019re missing important things. By ensuring you\u2019re seeing the things that matter, and shutting up the (many, many more) things that don\u2019t, Do Not Disturb could address this.  Android users can set rules for \u2018Do Not Disturb,\u2019 allowing certain apps or people through the wall. Photo: David Pierce/The Wall Street Journal  At the same time, Android and iOS should begin automatically managing your phone\u2019s distractions. They could differentiate between morning and evening, weekend and weekdays. Android can engage Do Not Disturb in sync with your calendar events, but it can\u2019t tell whether you\u2019re bored in the dentist\u2019s waiting room or stressing in a job interview. Devices could use their knowledge of your location, calendar and activity to figure out exactly how much you can be bothered.  Apple and Google are the only companies in a position to make this work at the system level. Third-party developers can\u2019t access the control they\u2019d need, across apps and services, to regulate the whole system. (And would you want them to?)  How to Do \u2018Do Not Disturb\u2019 Set a schedule .

One app, Flipd, can temporarily remove distracting apps from your phone, but \u201cthis is not something Apple makes it easy for us to do,\u201d said Alanna Harvey, one of the app\u2019s co-founders. Even the setup is enough to scare people away, though Ms. Harvey says it\u2019s the app\u2019s most popular feature \u201conce people get over the hump.\"  Google and Apple say they\u2019re working on improvements to Do Not Disturb, though both declined to provide specific plans.  Spokesmen for both companies also pointed to notification controls as another way to manage your influx. I don\u2019t see it that way. Certainly, you should control which apps can notify you and how, but there\u2019s no \u201cwhen\u201d notification setting. What users really need is an easy way to receive notifications from partners, bosses and close friends\u2014and from any app. Why constantly tweak each app\u2019s notifications? We should be able to make the rules once, with one tool, and not worry about it again.  When you really need to focus, of course, there\u2019s one feature even more powerful than Do Not Disturb. Just turn your phone off. But then how will you navigate home? Or read your book? Or plan dinner, play \u201cAlto\u2019s Adventure\u201d or check your fantasy team?

The electric-vehicle maker has been under pressure recently after a fatal crash and concerns over the company\u2019s cash position.

The California Democrat serves as ranking member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, a powerful oversight panel. Recently this committee succeeded in wresting key documents from the Justice Department and FBI after months of being stonewalled, and Republican staffers have summarized the info in a classified four-page memo. Those who have read the memo say it includes evidence of abuses by Justice and FBI officials handling the investigation into Donald Trump\u2019s alleged ties with Russia, most salaciously summed up in the infamous Steele dossier named for the former British spy who compiled it.  But whether it\u2019s material submitted to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court for a warrant on a Trump campaign official or conveniently missing texts between an FBI agent and his FBI mistress\u2014who both hated Mr. Trump and would each serve on the special counsel\u2019s team\u2014Mr. Schiff exhibits no interest. Saturday on CNN he implied that the only ones who are interested are Russian bots on Twitter .  When CNN\u2019s Ana Cabrera asked him why not let the American people see the info and decide for themselves, Mr. Schiff went full Jack Nicholson : \u201cThe American people, unfortunately, don\u2019t have the underlying materials and therefore they can\u2019t see how distorted and misleading this document is,\u201d he answered. Translation: The American people can\u2019t handle the truth.  It makes no sense. If the American people lack context, that\u2019s an argument for more disclosure, not less. But it fits a pattern. Mr. Schiff tells us there is \u201cmore than circumstantial evidence\u201d of collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow. But he never produces it.  To put it another way, Mr. Schiff appears to be the only man in America who doesn\u2019t seem to want to know whether the material in the Steele dossier is true or not. All along he has stood against getting relevant information\u2014fighting subpoenas for Justice, fighting subpoenas for the FBI, and fighting the subpoena for the bank records of Fusion GPS (which ultimately prompted the admission that the Clinton campaign had helped fund the Steele dossier).  Last week offered a good example of the Schiff standard in operation. Democrats wanted the House testimony of Fusion co-founder Glenn Simpson made public, and Republicans on the Intel committee joined them to vote in favor of releasing it. But when it came to making the classified memo available to any congressman who wished to read it, Republicans alone stood for transparency. Every Democrat, led by Mr. Schiff, voted to keep the memo secret.  On the Saturday following this vote, the chairmen of three key House oversight committees\u2014 Devin Nunes (Intel), Bob Goodlatte (Judiciary) and Trey Gowdy (Oversight)\u2014met to discuss the way forward. They released no statement. But as more of their members see the memo, the rumbling to make the information public will only grow.  Meanwhile, even Democrats not on the Intel Committee have been infected by the same lack of curiosity that afflicts Mr. Schiff. In the few days since the memo became available to every member of the House, roughly 190 Republicans have read it, compared with only a dozen Democrats.  Congress\u2014especially the oversight committees\u2014is supposed to act as the people\u2019s watchdog. Mr. Trump is routinely slammed for his indifference to reading, especially the endless memos and policy papers that find their way onto a president\u2019s desk. But what does it say when the ranking member of a vital oversight committee appears uninterested in what his committee has unearthed about a matter that speaks to the integrity of our highest institutions of law enforcement?  The Beltway standard for comparison for scandal today is Watergate. It\u2019s now been nearly five decades since men affiliated with Richard Nixon\u2019s Committee for the Re-Election of the President were nabbed while breaking into Democratic headquarters at the Watergate complex. The purpose of the break-in was to plant a bug and gain embarrassing intel on the Democratic Party and its presidential candidate, George McGovern.  If Mr. Trump and his team worked with Vladimir Putin to steal the 2016 election from Hillary Clinton, it would indeed be as scandalous as Watergate. But it would be just as scandalous if a Democratic administration\u2019s Justice Department and FBI used unsubstantiated opposition research\u2014parts of which were quite possibly drawn from Russian disinformation\u2014to obtain warrants to spy on members of a Republican presidential campaign.  In 1972, Nixon press secretary Ron Ziegler dismissed the break-in as a \u201cthird-rate burglary.\u201d Today Mr. Schiff routinely dismisses the House Intel Committee findings about Justice and the FBI\u2019s handling of the Steele dossier as \u201ca profound distraction\u201d\u2014while he too fights an investigation into a presidential election. Could that be why he\u2019s so opposed to letting the American people see what he\u2019s seen?

Cannes festival director Thierry Fremaux said last month that Netflix had refused to give its movies theatrical distribution in France and would therefore be banned from competition at the 12-day festival.

The company has released a few films, like fantasy thriller \u201cBright,\u201d starring Will Smith, in a small number of theaters. But most major chains have refused to show Netflix movies because it releases them at the same time online. Movies from traditional studios typically run exclusively in cinemas for about three months.  Sarandos said he personally would not attend the May 8-19 festival in the French Riviera, but said Netflix executives would be there looking at films to acquire.  Netflix said it had nothing to add to Sarandos\u2019 comments to Variety.

REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo  Amazon on Wednesday rose over 2 percent and touched $1,500 for the first time, while Netflix rose also rose over 2 percent and nearly hit its own record high.  Investors, left nervous after major indexes slumped into correction territory at the start of the month but still confident about the health of the U.S. economy, are doubling down on already popular companies expected to post above-average earnings growth. Many of those are businesses poised to benefit from consumers and companies with more money to spend and invest as a result of U.S. tax cuts enacted this year.  Among such stocks, Amazon has climbed 2.7 percent since the end of January and Netflix has increased 4.9 percent, both outperforming the S&P 500\u2019s 3.3 percent decline.  \u201cInvestors are willing to pay a premium for go-go tech stocks that can deliver returns in any environment,\u201d said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors in Chicago. \u201cPeople are going to stay home and eat popcorn and watch movies on Netflix no matter what.\u201d  Analysts on average expect Amazon to increase its adjusted, non-GAAP earnings per share by 82 percent this year. Netflix\u2019s earnings per share are expected to more than triple, according to Thomson Reuters data.  That compares with expectations for S&P 500 aggregate earnings to expand by an unusually strong 19.1 percent in 2018, helped by a tax cuts and a stronger economy, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  In terms of their earnings valuations, Amazon and Netflix appear exceptionally expensive compared with most stocks. Amazon recently traded at 155 times earnings expected over the next 12 months, while Netflix traded at 94 times expected earnings, according to Thomson Reuters data.  As the dust settles from the sell-off earlier this month, investors also remain optimistic about the technology sector. After leading last year\u2019s stock market rally, the S&P 500 information technology index in 2018 is in a neck-and-neck lead with consumer discretionary, both about 4.9 percent higher year to date. Amazon is the most heavily weighted stock in the consumer discretionary index and accounted for much of its gain.

REUTERS/Leonhard Foeger/File Photo  Following earnings growth of 20.5 percent for 2017, the S&P information technology sector is expected by analysts to expand its earnings by another 17.1 percent this year.  Overall S&P 500 earnings grew about 12.8 percent in 2017 and are seen increasing another 17.9 percent this year.  While analysts have increased their earnings estimates for hundreds of companies to account for new tax cuts, investors still lack a clear picture of how companies will spend their windfalls. Some companies may reinvest it, including spending on technology like cloud computing and cyber security.

The results drove Netflix to a market capitalization of more than $100 billion for the first time. Shares jumped 9 percent to over $248 in after-hours trading on Monday after rallying throughout the month and rising 53 percent last year. (tmsnrt.rs/1Ry82wG)  The company has signed up more than half of all U.S. broadband households and is building its customer base in 190 countries by spending billions on programming.  Netflix picked up 6.36 million subscribers in international markets from October through December, when it released new seasons of critically acclaimed shows \u201cStranger Things\u201d and \u201cThe Crown\u201d as well as Will Smith action movie \u201cBright.\u201d That topped Wall Street expectations of 5.1 million, according to FactSet.  Along with 1.98 million customer additions in the United States, the company ended the year with 117.58 million streaming subscribers around the globe, despite a price hike in October.  \u201cNetflix is pouring more and more money into making content, and it is directly translating into more subscribers,\u201d BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield said. \u201cThey see a huge opportunity and they are moving as fast as they can to attack it.\u201d  The company also said it took a $39 million non-cash charge for \u201cunreleased content we\u2019ve decided not to move forward with.\u201d A source familiar with the matter said the charge was related to content starring Kevin Spacey, with whom Netflix cut ties after he was accused of sexual misconduct.  Netflix temporarily halted production of \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d to write out Spacey\u2019s character and decided not to release the film \u201cGore,\u201d which starred Spacey as Gore Vidal.  Related Coverage Netflix takes $39 million charge after Kevin Spacey scandal  Spacey has apologized to one of his accusers, and according to his representatives is seeking unspecified treatment. Reuters was unable to independently confirm the accusations.  The charge is one of the first signs of costs faced by companies in the wake of a widespread campaign against sexual harassment.  Netflix turned a DVD-by-mail business into an online competitor of movie channel HBO. As it grew it began licensing its own original shows to ensure a stream of new offerings if studio suppliers ended deals.  In fact, Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) is making a major push into online streaming and will pull its first-run shows and movies from Netflix in 2019 as Hollywood fights for audiences.  Netflix plans to spend up to $8 billion this year on TV shows and movies to fend off Disney, Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), studios-owned Hulu and local competitors that are jumping into online video, and it is turning more and more to high-budget projects, such as the roughly $90 million \u201cBright.\u201d  In 2017, Netflix recorded its first full-year profit in international markets. The company has said it is aiming for steady improvements in profitability overseas this year.

Netflix is raising its marketing budget faster than revenue is growing and will spend about $2 billion this year. The company expects negative cash flow in 2018 of $3 billion to $4 billion, up from $2 billion in 2017.  Last October, Netflix raised prices for two of its three main subscription plans to help fund the substantial content investment. The earnings report showed customers took it in stride.  \u201cConsumers are tolerant as long as something\u2019s improving,\u201d Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, on a post-earnings webcast, said of the price increase.  For the December quarter, Netflix reported diluted earnings-per-share of 41 cents, even with the expectations of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Revenue for the three months totaled $3.286 billion, in line with forecasts.  Looking ahead, Netflix forecast streaming customer additions of 6.35 million for the first quarter, above analysts\u2019 expectation of 5.01 million, according to FactSet.  Investors appear confident in Netflix\u2019s ability to grow. Netflix recently traded at 91 times expected earnings for the next 12 months, versus Amazon at 152 times earnings and Disney at 17 times earnings, according to Thomson Reuters data.

It\u2019s the top-performing stock in the S&P 500 this year.  Jeffrey Wlodarczak at Pivotal Research Group raised his price target to a Street-high $400 on Tuesday, arguing that as long as Netflix continues to beat estimates and issue bullish subscriber forecasts, the stock will continue to advance. Wlodarczak said Netflix\u2019s higher-than-expected 2018 marketing-expense forecast didn\u2019t faze investors, writing in a note that \u201cthe market appeared to effectively give NFLX management carte blanche to spend aggressively to drive healthy subscriber growth.\u201d  The company\u2019s aggressive spending on original content and marketing means it probably won\u2019t generate free cash flow for the next few years, with analysts on average predicting outflows of $2.85 billion this year, $1.92 billion in 2019 and $1.16 billion 2020, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Canada\u2019s second-most populous province said Tuesday it would make the collection of the provincial sales tax mandatory for suppliers of goods and services based outside Quebec to put them on par with local rivals. Quebec expects the measures will enable it to recover C$155 million ($120 million) in lost revenue over five years, according to budget documents released in Quebec City.  A failure to collect taxes on online sales of goods and services to companies outside the province now costs Quebec about C$270 million annually, according to estimates by the provincial finance ministry. Most of the money, or C$158 million, pertains to goods such as shoes and clothes purchased abroad, Finance Minister Carlos Leitao said Tuesday.  An agreement between Los Gatos, California-based Netflix and the federal government over filming in Canada provoked widespread outrage in Quebec last year, in part because it didn\u2019t subject the company to a sales tax. That sparked the ire of Canadian media companies that must apply the tax, including on streaming units they set up to compete with Netflix.  \u201cFor services, Netflix and others, we are proposing legislative measures that will force these companies to register for our provincial sales tax regime,\u201d Leitao said Tuesday at a press conference in Quebec City. \u201cThey will need to collect the sales tax and to send it to us.\u201d  For companies selling goods online, Quebec will follow the approach recommended by the Organization for Economic Co- Operation and Development, which is to collect taxes at the border, Leitao said.  Starting Jan. 1, foreign companies that sell more than C$30,000 a year in taxable supplies of goods or services to Quebec consumers will be required to register for the provincial sales tax, budget documents show. Until now, suppliers without a physical or significant presence in the province weren\u2019t required to register for the tax, or to collect or remit it.  Canadian companies that don\u2019t have a physical or significant presence in Quebec will get eight more months to adjust: they won\u2019t be required to register for the provincial sales tax until Sept. 1, 2019.  \u201cGiven the Canadian economy\u2019s high level of integration, a potentially significant number of businesses of all sizes may be impacted,\u201d the finance ministry\u2019s document says.  Premier Philippe Couillard, who is running for re-election in October, is following up on a pledge to collect the money from online sellers after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau ruled out additional taxes. The C$270 million that is eluding Quebec\u2019s coffers represents about 1.3 percent of annual sales tax receipts, according to the government.

At 6 percent, its ratio is significantly lower than those of higher-rated media companies such as Walt Disney Co. and Viacom Inc.  \u201cIf you\u2019re in Netflix\u2019s position, it\u2019s something you should talk about,\u201d Flynn said. \u201cIt\u2019s the best way to position your credit profile.\u201d  A representative from Netflix declined to comment.  Subscriber Growth  The world\u2019s largest online TV network reported its strongest year of subscriber growth to date, propelling its market capitalization in line with the likes of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Qualcomm Inc. Its shares jumped as much as 13 percent to $257.71 in New York.  Yet splurging on new shows comes at a cost. The company has said it will spend as much as $8 billion on programming this year, and disclosed Monday it will shell out another $2 billion for marketing. Long-term debt stood at $6.5 billion at year-end, while long-term content liabilities totaled $3.33 billion.  The stock surge prompted multiple equity analysts to raise their price targets on the stock, but the optimism wasn\u2019t shared by all. Matthew Harrigan, an analyst at Buckingham Research Group, downgraded the stock to neutral from buy, saying he\u2019s skeptical that the company can replicate its domestic success abroad, especially in Asia where the local competition is dense and Netflix lacks pricing power.  \u201cYou\u2019ve got to step back and do a sanity check on this,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a great product and are competing with other great media companies. But this isn\u2019t like Amazon, where it has the opportunity to take over the world with AI and penetrate every retail category.\u201d  Chief Financial Officer David Wells said on an earnings call late Monday that as the company continues to build its content, some of the factors influencing its working capital needs have started to moderate.  \u201cAs our operating profit grows, we\u2019ll be able to pay more for that organically,\u201d he said.  Content and subscriber growth are the roots to Netflix\u2019s success, which is why it\u2019s hard to see the company pulling back from that to help turn cash flow positive, said Rahim Shad, a high-yield analyst at Invesco Ltd.  \u201cWith Hulu and Amazon making their own strides in original content, you almost have to spend your way to remain relevant and successful at this game,\u201d Shad said in an interview. The upside case for the bonds would be a takeover by an investment-grade company like Apple Inc., as Disney plans to acquire a majority of 21st Century Fox Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. is already developing its own content, he said.  Netflix also said it doesn\u2019t expect the new limitation on interest deductibility in the recently passed U.S. tax law to affect its business. That aspect of the law has been seen to deal a blow to junk-rated companies, especially those rated B and lower.

A small but loud #DeleteNetflix campaign has burst forth on Twitter since \"The Mechanism,\" a show that is a work of fiction based on the real-life, multi-year corruption probe dubbed Carwash, was added to the streaming service Friday. Ex-users are posting proof of their now-defunct accounts in one of Netflix\u2019s most successful international markets.  Former President Dilma Rousseff, who was impeached in 2016 amid fallout from the scandal, called the show \"underhanded and full of lies.\" Prominent movie critic Pablo Villaca said he canceled his subscription after six years and encouraged others to do the same, saying the decision to air the show was \"irresponsible.\"  \"The director invents facts. He doesn\u2019t merely reproduce fake news. He has turned himself into a creator of fake news,\" according to a post on Rousseff\u2019s website. \"It would be like if a movie about the last moments of John Kennedy inserted a Lee Harvey Oswald character making accusations against the victim. Or a movie where Winston Churchill makes a deal with Adolf Hitler to attack the United States.\"  The debacle took over local media, with director Jose Padilha, who also produced the Netflix hit \"Narcos,\" responding that critics are too focused on the details and missing the bigger picture.  While this isn\u2019t the first portrayal of the corruption probe that continues sweeping through Brazil\u2019s political and business elite, the timing of the release -- on the day the operation hit its 50th phase -- has helped fuel some of the reaction.  After successive scandals that almost took down a second president in as many years, most of Congress and the presidency will be up for grabs in general elections in October. On Monday, former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva had a 12-year prison sentence for corruption confirmed by an appeals court. He awaits a Supreme Court ruling that will determine whether or not he will be arrested, and with that, influence the role he will play in the elections.  Lula leads all voter polls, and he has repeatedly reiterated his innocence and denounced the Carwash investigation as political persecution, saying he will fight until the very end.  Sergio Moro, the judge who became the face of the Carwash probe and hailed by some Brazilians as a savior of sorts for locking up corrupt politicians and businessmen, said in an TV interview Monday that while there are artistic liberties in both the movie and the show, drawing attention to Brazil\u2019s issue with corruption is important.  The show changed the names of those involved in the case -- Petrobras, as the state-run oil company at the center of the investigation is known, became Petrobrasil. Alberto Youssef, Brazil\u2019s black-market central banker who was one of the to be caught up in the probe, is portrayed as Roberto Ibrahim.  One of the biggest points of controversy is a conversation in which a politician -- who resembles Lula -- talks about an agreement to prevent the corruption probe from proceeding. The episode alludes to a political crisis surrounding President Michel Temer, which took down then-Planning Minister Romero Juca after a recording of a similar conversation between himself and a former executive linked to Petrobras emerged.  \"The left was and is just as corrupt as the right. \u2018The Mechanism\u2019 has no ideology,\" Padilha is cited as saying in Estado de S.Paulo newspaper.  Netflix is no stranger to Brazilian political drama. The company placed large ads at the Brasilia airport -- the nation\u2019s capital, where much of the Carwash probe has taken place -- to promote the latest season of House of Cards. When news broke in May that a businessman had secretly recorded the president allegedly discussing hush money in a fresh round of scandal that almost took down the government, that show\u2019s profile tweeted -- in Portuguese -- \"It\u2019s getting hard to compete.\"  On Tuesday, Netflix\u2019s official Twitter account in Brazil posted a video with a mock ad for a \"corruption store\" featuring products such as fashionable covers for ankle monitors and underwear with pockets to better store bribes.

The rapid pace of subscriber additions is impressive, but so is the amount of cash going up in flames.  Netflix Inc. is the Uber of the entertainment programming business. Whether Netflix investors recoil or cheer at the comparison depends on their risk tolerance.  Netflix doesn't share Uber's inclination to push boundaries, and it has a well-functioning business. But both companies are impressive growth machines that rely on outside funding to maintain the momentum. And in both cases, it's not clear what the real trajectory of the business would look like if access to capital dried up.  First, let's run through the impressive growth part of the Netflix machine.  Growing Like a Weed Netflix keeps adding streaming video subscribers rapidly Source: Bloomberg  Netflix said on Monday that it added 8.3 million more subscribers than it lost for its streaming service. That was the most new streaming customers in Netflix's history. Even in the U.S., where analysts believe more than half of households with fast internet service already subscribe to Netflix, the company added more net new streaming customers in 2017 than it did the year before. The continued pace of customer additions validates both Netflix's recent decision to raise prices on many subscribers in the U.S. and to go all-in on a globalization strategy the company unveiled two years ago.  But just like at Uber, growth comes at a cost for Netflix. That cost is the piles of money Netflix has set alight for three years to finance its globe-trotting ambitions, and to purchase -- rather than rent -- more of the TV shows and movies the company makes available to streaming subscribers. The cash costs for Netflix's streaming programming reached $8.9 billion in 2017, about double the costs from two years earlier. The number of Netflix streaming customers hasn't increased as much, at about 60 percent, over that period.  Bonfire Netflix's free cash flow has turned negative in the last three years as the company splurged on programming and international expansion Source: Netflix  Netflix also said its free cash flow would widen to as much as negative $4 billion in 2018, compared with an already stunning negative $2 billion in 2017. Netflix has already been clear it won't generate positive cash flow for years as it tries to become the preferred entertainment source for the world, and one that has profitable economics. But potentially burning through $4 billion in cash is staggering. Netflix and Uber are betting that the companies should lean into their growth and spend even more to get bigger fast. It could turn out to be a stellar bet. Or fail spectacularly.  Netflix's strategy means two things: The company must keep churning out shows compelling enough to persuade more people to subscribe, and it needs to be able to continue borrowing money at low cost to finance its losses.  So far, Netflix stock and debt investors aren't worried. Netflix bonds due in 2026 have been trading just below 100 cents on the dollar. Netflix shares shot up about 9 percent in after-hours trading after the company released its financial results. Already the company's enterprise value is more than 50 times estimated 2018 earnings excluding interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and employee stock compensation costs. Those are not characteristics indicating signs of worry.  It's hard to find fault with Netflix's execution or its track record. The company is making a rational decision to splurge while it can and borrow money while it's cheap. But no one knows what Netflix looks like in normal funding times. What happens if the debt market isn't as compliant in coming years? The Netflix growth machine suddenly looks less like a sure thing. I'd call it a roller-coaster ride, but at least roller coasters tend to follow a predictable trajectory and wind up exactly where they started.

Rhimes, the producer of \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d and \u201cScandal,\u201d bolted from Walt Disney Co.\u2019s ABC in August.  No longer content to license shows from other media companies, Netflix and fellow technology giant Amazon.com Inc. are throwing money at Hollywood\u2019s top talent to lure them away from those studios. They are upending the TV business in the process, driving up the cost of talent and weakening many of the traditional powers.  Ryan Murphy Photographer: Monica Schipper/Getty Images for Entertainment Weekly  Hollywood studios have endured threats from outsiders before, but the list of talent making the jump grows by the day.  Horror Story  Netflix, with an annual budget of $8 billion, is paying Murphy, the producer of \u201cAmerican Horror Story,\u201d about $300 million over five years to make shows and movies for the streaming service. The money will support overhead for Ryan Murphy Productions along with his fees for writing, directing and producing.  Murphy was in the process of negotiating a new deal at Fox when Disney agreed to buy its crosstown rival for more than $52 billion. Disney Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger made a personal call to Murphy, assuring him that \u201cthe reason Disney was interested in buying Fox is they believed in the assets and the executives and their creators,\u201d the producer recalled. \u201cHe was very sweet and transparent and kind.\u201d  Shondaland  Shonda Rhimes Photographer: Bryan Bedder/Getty Images for Vulture Festival  Rhimes was the biggest name to leave traditional TV for streaming when she announced she was signing a long-term deal with Netflix. She\u2019d worked at ABC for more than a decade, becoming one of the few showrunners and TV writers known to the public.  Rhimes is also one of the few prominent black showrunners in Hollywood, and has led the way in creating more diversity onscreen. Netflix gave her more than $100 million to ease the transition in a multiyear deal.

TV networks and studios are struggling to keep up with a rival who will spend $300 million on a top producer like Ryan Murphy and pay lavishly further down the food chain.  \u201cWith combinations of base, bonus, equity and long-term incentive, new-media companies are figuring out ways to beat traditional studios,\u201d said Neal Lenarsky, founder of STI Management, which represents executives in the media industry.  Old Hollywood is trying to respond. Some studios have pulled back from selling shows to the online service. Walt Disney Co. went so far as to yank its movies from the company and is launching streaming services of its own. 21st Century Fox Inc. sued in 2016, claiming the company induced executives to breach their contracts. Netflix countersued, and the case is inching along.  Few Titles  None of that is stopping Netflix from attracting publicists with as much as $400,000 in salary and other compensation, or about double their prior paychecks, according to the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private compensation data. More senior professionals are seeing similar increases, said one executive who was approached by Netflix.  In making offers, Netflix estimates a candidate\u2019s value based on experience and title, according to employees who asked not to be identified discussing company policy. Then it pays the recruit at the top of what the corresponding range might be. The company also allows candidates to take as much a 50 percent of their compensation in options, they said. A recent change in California law bars employers from asking applicants about their prior salary.  Titles at Netflix don\u2019t necessarily correspond with Hollywood convention. For the most part, the company has just three executive roles -- director, manager and vice president -- and some represent real promotions for people jumping over. Netflix also lets some staffers see what co-workers earn via an internal database, according to the people.  And while many studios reward employees with amenities like a large personal office and titles that seem to confer prestige, almost no one at Netflix has an office. Not even Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings, who co-founded the company.  Netflix employed more than 5,400 people at year-end, fewer people than its competitors in media, and sales are projected to reach $15.8 billion this year. CBS Corp., owner of the CBS and Showtime TV networks, has a payroll of more 12,000 and revenue projected at $14.5 billion this year.  Perhaps nowhere is Netflix more aggressive than in marketing and public relations. The company will spend about $2 billion promoting its service and shows this year. The company lists almost 500 openings on its website, with about a third in Los Angeles and more than 50 in marketing and PR.  Where the Jobs Are Locations of recent job openings listed at the Netflix website Source: Company website  Once wholly dependent on older movies and TV shows licensed from other companies, Netflix will release 700 original programs this year, including 80 movies. A growing share is produced in-house by Netflix Studios, based in the company\u2019s Hollywood offices.  Producing and promoting those shows requires an expanding legion of employees, from colorists to sound engineers to publicists. Netflix is looking to hire dozens of executives for production and post-production jobs, and still more for marketing.  Experienced staffers are in short supply, forcing Netflix to raid rivals who also happen to be programming suppliers. Last year, Netflix hired Bela Bajaria, formerly with Comcast Corp.\u2019s Universal Television, to oversee unscripted TV, as well as Scott Stuber, a producer based at Universal Pictures, to run feature films. Julie Fontaine, executive vice president of movie publicity at Lions Gate Entertainment Corp., jumped to a similar post. The company has recruited dozens of PR people from agencies and studios including Fox and Disney.  Pleasing Investors  Some analysts have questioned Netflix\u2019s outlays, arguing there\u2019s no way the company can turn a profit while spending at its current pace. But CEO Hastings and his team have satisfied investors by delivering record subscriber growth.  \u201cThere are fewer and fewer services a TV studio can provide an artist or producer that Netflix can\u2019t,\u201d said Anthony DiClemente, an analyst with Evercore ISI. \u201cWall Street investors right now don\u2019t care how much they spend on content and infrastructure as long as subscribers are growing and beating estimates.\u201d  Hastings was asked about sky-high talent spending at a recent event at the company\u2019s Hollywood offices. Besides Ryan Murphy, Netflix also snared Shonda Rhimes, at producer at Disney\u2019s ABC, in a deal valued at more than $100 million.  \u201cDo we worry about overpaying? Always,\u201d Hastings told reporters in March. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to be good stewards of the customers\u2019 money.\u201d", "stock": "NFLX", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-27", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-27/help-wanted-netflix-movie-publicist-400-000-including-options"}, {"article": "Los Angeles (AP) -- Netflix shares surged to an all-time high following the news that Barack Obama and Netflix reportedly are negotiating a deal for the former president and his wife, Michelle, to produce shows exclusively for the streaming service.

The average user is paying just 5.24 euros a month for a subscription, a drop of more than 20 percent from two years ago. And the only other major online music company to go public, Pandora Media Inc., is struggling.  Yet there\u2019s reason to believe Spotify shares will soar once they begin trading under the ticker symbol SPOT. The music-streaming company has all the hallmarks of another big-spending company with an all-you-can-eat subscription service: Netflix Inc.  Spotify files prospectus for public offering on NYSE. Bloomberg\u2019s Alex Barinka reports. (Source: Bloomberg)  Spotify made no direct comparison to Netflix in a filing Wednesday announcing its plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange, but its pitch to investors rests on a similar thesis to the one driving Netflix shares, which are the best-performing on the S&P 500 this year. Spotify even has the same chief financial officer who took Netflix public -- Barry McCarthy -- and Netflix\u2019s chief content officer Ted Sarandos sits on Spotify\u2019s board.  Read more about the Spotify filing in this Gadfly piece.  The internet has changed the way people consume entertainment, creating an opening for new players to upend sclerotic businesses. Much as Netflix offered customers a cheaper, more convenient alternative to DVDs and pay TV, Spotify has given consumers a reason not to buy CDs from Walmart or songs from iTunes.  \u201cSpotify has transformed the way people access and enjoy music,\u201d the company said in the filing. \u201cToday, millions of people around the world have access to over 35 million tracks through Spotify, whenever and wherever they want.\u201d  Like Netflix, Spotify offers consumers access to a head-spinning selection of content, personalized to their tastes. And like Netflix, Spotify carved out a huge lead, and is now being chased by the biggest players in technology and media.  Big Opportunities?  The world is still in the early stages of the shift to online distribution of movies, TV and music, and the race is on to sign people up all over the world. Netflix, with almost 118 million subscribers worldwide, has allayed concerns about its slowing growth by reminding analysts there are more than 700 million broadband households. Spotify, with 71 million paying users, touts an even larger number in its filing: 1.6 billion payment-enabled smartphone owners expected by 2021.  Being the biggest comes at a cost. Netflix is burning through cash to acquire more programming, telling investors it\u2019s to fund future growth. Spotify delivers more than 70 percent of its sales to music rights holders, despite efforts to improve profit margins.  Sarandos is where the comparisons between Netflix and Spotify get tricky. Netflix, which already forsook DVDs for online streaming, is in the midst of another great evolution. It is building its own studio to produce shows on its own.  Breaking Through  Spotify says it has no interest in signing artists, or paying for artists to record. However, it has another plan to reduce its reliance on its main suppliers: by making them less relevant.  \u201cThe old model favored certain gatekeepers. Artists had to be signed to a label,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Daniel Ek wrote in a letter included in the filing. \u201cThey needed access to a recording studio, and they had to be played on terrestrial radio to achieve success. Today, artists can produce and release their own music. Labels, studios, and radio still matter, but in a cluttered landscape, artists\u2019 biggest challenge is navigating this complexity to get heard. We believe Spotify empowers them to break through.\u201d", "stock": "NFLX", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-01", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-01/spotify-paints-self-as-next-netflix-transforming-entertainment"}, {"article": "The current earnings-report cycle was already off to a strong start when Netflix Inc. set an exceptionally high bar this week, blowing so far beyond subscriber estimates that the video service entered the exalted club of companies valued at more than $100 billion.  Netflix joins the array of U.S., European and Asian companies whose earnings are getting a lift from quickened global economic growth. Meanwhile, U.S. tax cuts should give American companies like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. the chance to reward investors with goodies such as buybacks on top of bonuses they\u2019ve already sprinkled out to workers.  Not every CEO will have as pleasant news to deliver as Netflix\u2019s Reed Hastings. Stung by an October earnings call that went awry, Oscar Munoz on Tuesday afternoon is scheduled to report United Continental Inc.\u2019s second straight annual profit decline. And speculation is mounting that John Flannery will have to cut General Electric Co.\u2019s 2018 profit outlook on Wednesday due to deep problems in the company\u2019s industrial and finance operations.  With more than a tenth of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 companies already reported, profit\u2019s up 14 percent from a year earlier while sales have risen about 8 percent. Here are a few things to watch:  The Tax Man cometh and he\u2019s got good news  The lower corporate tax rate Congress approved late last year has already helped some companies boost profit forecasts for 2018 -- and they\u2019ve entered earnings season willing to share the largess. Macquarie Research estimates most U.S. airlines will see an average 20 percent increase in earnings per share. The benefits will hit first for cash taxpayers like Southwest Airlines Co., which reports Thursday and has already announced bonuses of $1,000 for its workers.  Wal-Mart is getting a roughly $2 billion tax benefit, and analysts expect it to boost share buybacks and potentially cut prices in addition to the worker raises and bonuses it\u2019s already announced. The world\u2019s largest retailer reports Feb. 20.  While Verizon Communications Inc. reported earnings that missed estimates Tuesday, it said it expects a massive windfall from the tax cut to boost 2018 cash flow by $3.5 billion to $4 billion. The largest U.S. wireless carrier hinted it may also reward bonuses, saying in a statement that it will make an announcement later in the day on \u201chow employees will further share in the company\u2019s success.\u201d  Lower tax = more growth = more shovels  The U.S. tax cut contributed to expectations for faster global growth, and that should help companies that sell goods and services worldwide. The International Monetary Fund this week said it expects the world economy to jump 3.9 percent this year and next -- in each case a 0.2 percentage point bump from its projection in October.  With that growth comes more digging, paving and loading, and analysts have raised 2018 forecasts for Caterpillar Inc. even as it wraps its strongest earnings year since 2012 with Thursday\u2019s report. Those roads need more cars, and IHS Markit predicts global auto sales will rise about 1.5 percent in 2018. General Motors Co. has forecast its profit this year will be consistent with a record of as much as $6.50 a share for 2017.  Global Growth Bodes Well for Earnings The fastest global growth in seven years should help lift corporate profits in 2018 Source: IMF economic forecast  Heady times don\u2019t prevent FX headwinds  The strong global economy can only go so far -- corporate earnings are also exposed to the whims of foreign exchange. The euro gained against every major currency in 2017 and strengthened further in January, so expect more profit warnings from European companies like the one last week from Paris-based distiller Remy Cointreau SA. Luxury conglomerate LVMH, which reports Thursday after the Paris stock market closes, and German software maker SAP AG, which reports Jan. 30, are among others that may be hurt by the euro. The question is how big of a hit, and whether it\u2019s already reflected in stock prices.  Euro Beat All Major Currencies Last Year The strengthened euro is likely to hurt European company earnings this season  The flipside? The dollar\u2019s decline against most major currencies should give a boost to U.S. exporters and companies that translate foreign sales back into dollars. PPG Industries Inc. said last week, for example, that the weaker greenback would increase the paint-maker\u2019s 2018 revenue by as much as $300 million. Post-it Notes maker 3M Co., which generates about 60 percent of its sales overseas, reports on Thursday and expects favorable exchange rates to add 10 cents a share to profit this year.  Can profits stay ahead of energy costs?  While surging oil prices will benefit energy companies, they\u2019re also having a wider effect. Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. last week said fourth-quarter earnings got a boost from rising crude prices and growing shipments of other commodities. For chemical makers like DowDuPont Inc., which reports Feb. 1, a big question is whether product prices can rise fast enough to recoup higher costs for oil-derived raw materials.  An iPhone\u2019s ring is heard round the world  And as always, investors will be watching Apple Inc., the world\u2019s most valuable company, when it reports Feb. 1 for signs of how demand is faring for the iPhone X. The results are likely to affect Asian suppliers. South Korea\u2019s LG Display Co. reported Tuesday that operating profit missed the lowest analyst estimate. The news came about a week after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. forecast revenue that fell short of expectations, as waning smartphone sales in China and a strong local currency outweighed booming demand from cryptocurrency miners. Samsung Electronics Co., a supplier and rival to Apple, reported lower-than-projected profit this month as it lost momentum in memory chips.  \u2014 With assistance by Dave McCombs, Nick Turner, Tara Patel, Crayton Harrison, Rebecca Penty, Rick Clough, Julie Johnsson, Jack Kaskey, Mary Schlangenstein, Joe Deaux, Scott Moritz, and Jessica Brice", "stock": "NFLX", "label": 1, "date": "2018-01-23", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-23/netflix-sets-high-bar-for-already-strong-global-earnings-season"}, {"article": "CBS Corp., owner of the most-watched TV network in the U.S., has come up with a solution to investor concerns about the future of the TV business: make more shows like \u201cStar Trek: Discovery.\u201d  The media company has doubled the number of programs it produces in recent years, creating shows for its own TV channels and streaming services, and others for tech giants Netflix, Amazon and Apple.

Netflix has poached prolific US TV producer Ryan Murphy from 21st Century Fox in a deal worth up to $300 million, making it one of the biggest TV production deals ever signed, the Financial Times reports.  Murphy will begin creating content exclusively for Netflix in July, and the series he created at 21st Century Fox, including \"American Horror Story\" and \"Feud,\" will remain on the company's networks. The deal will deepen the existing relationship between Netflix and Murphy, who previously signed a deal to executively produce a Netflix series in February 2017.  Fox bid aggressively to retain Murphy, but the producer's decision to move to Netflix makes sense for two key reasons:  Murphy's dodging the uncertainty surrounding the Disney-Fox acquisition. Murphy maintains close relationships with Fox Television Group Chairman Dana Walden and 21st Century Fox President Peter Rice. However, should Disney's landmark acquisition of most of 21st Century Fox's assets close as expected, it's not guaranteed that Walden and Rice will remain in their roles. This uncertainty factored into Murphy's decision to move.  Murphy maintains close relationships with Fox Television Group Chairman Dana Walden and 21st Century Fox President Peter Rice. However, should Disney's landmark acquisition of most of 21st Century Fox's assets close as expected, it's not guaranteed that Walden and Rice will remain in their roles. This uncertainty factored into Murphy's decision to move. He's gaining the creative freedom that comes with producing for a video streaming service. Murphy is known for his graphic and shocking work, and although the producer had virtually full creative freedom at Fox, working at Netflix will likely allow him to further explore his creative boundaries \u2014 creators generally have to worry less about profanity and nudity when creating for Netflix, as it's not a platform driven by ad revenue.  The deal is representative of the intensifying battle between digital video services and traditional media companies for top Hollywood talent. In addition to Fox's bid, Amazon also made a serious bid for the top Hollywood producer, according to The New York Times. Video streaming services like Netflix and Amazon are aggressively pursuing top creators and entertainers as eyeballs shift away from linear TV in favor of digital platforms.  Netflix has been successful in luring top Hollywood talent in the past year. The company poached accomplished producers Shonda Rhimes and Betsy Beers from ABC in August 2017. Additionally, Netflix has been able to sign separate deals with former Late Show host David Letterman, and big-name stand-up comedians Chris Rock, Dave Chappelle, and Amy Schumer. Netflix plans to spend up to $8 billion on original content in 2018, up from $6 billion in 2017, and its budget eclipses those of rivals like Amazon and Hulu, positioning Netflix well to continue to court top Hollywood talent.

The international video-streaming market is large and unaddressed, and Netflix could eat much of it.  Netflix's original and exclusive content positions it well in many markets.  Follow Netflix in real time here.  Netflix is not even close to being finished growing, according to Morgan Stanley's Benjamin Swinburne, one of the company's biggest bulls on Wall Street.  Swinburne thinks Netflix is \"still in the early stages of global adoption,\" citing the largely untapped international market as one key area of growth potential.  Morgan Stanley, Netflix  But Netflix shares haven't been without their problems as of late. In late March, they were pressured after President Donald Trump announced plans to crack down down on Chinese investment in US technology. They were also hit hard in the wake of Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal. In all, they've fallen more than 10% from their record high of $334 to their current price of $298.  But Swinburne says fear not, Netflix will be hit a fresh record high in no time. He has a $350 price target and a bull-case-scenario target of $440, both of which are well above the Wall Street consensus of $288.  Netflix has roughly 120 million subscribers, but the total addressable market for video streaming is much larger \u2014 more than 660 million by Swinburne's count. He says that, coupled with Netflix's \"history of successfully scaling in a wide variety of markets,\" makes him optimistic on the company's future.  Of those 660 million+ addressable subscribers, Swinburne believes Netflix will capture more than 300 million by 2028. That would represent one third of global broadband, compared to the roughly 20% Netflix has captured thus far, according to the note.  One reason Swinburne thinks Netflix will take much of that large market is not simply because of its superior brand perception as the leader in movie streaming, but also because of the content it can poach. Swinburne identified Netflix's \"ability to maintain exclusive content offering to differentiate product from competitors, and to a lesser extent, success of original programming,\" as core \"key value drivers.\" Netflix is known for winning bids for top original content producers who can make new content, exclusively for its platform.

Netflix's next 100 million subscribers will come from India, said Netflix CEO Reed Hastings at The Economic Times Global Business Summit (GBS) on Friday, per The Economic Times. For context, Netflix last reported 117.6 million global subscribers in Q4 2017.  The company didn't disclose how many India-based subscribers it had, but Consultancy Media Partners Asia estimates this figure at more than 500,000. To help grow its subscriber base in India, the company plans to release five to six Indian originals a year, and it announced on Friday three new Indian original series it's commissioning.  India is an attractive market for Netflix for several reasons:  Consumer spending in India is anticipated to more than double by 2025. Rising household income and economic growth are expected to boost consumer spending in the country to $4 trillion by 2025. Growth in consumer spending implies that the pool of consumers who can sign up for a Netflix subscription will increase significantly in the coming years.

Internet penetration in India has grown nearly sevenfold since 2009, per Kleiner Perkins. Meanwhile, Cisco predicts the number of internet users in India will rise from 373 million in 2016 to 829 million in 2021. And Indian consumers are increasingly viewing long-form online video. Online video consumption in India grew by five times in 2017, with videos longer than 20 minutes accounting for 96% of content viewed on Hotstar, India's largest video streaming service, per WARC. This bodes well for Netflix, which tends to focus on releasing longer-form original series over short-form original content.  However, Netflix's pricing strategy may cause Indian consumers to turn to more affordable streaming services. A Netflix subscription in India costs around $7-12 per month, depending on the package, versus $3 per month for Hotstar and $15 per year for Amazon Prime, which includes access to Prime Video. Hastings said Netflix hopes Indian consumers compare Netflix's price to movie tickets, rather than a typical pay-TV subscription, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Although Indian consumers will gain more disposable income in the coming years, the amount they're willing spend on OTT services will remain limited, which may inhibit Netflix's ability to onboard subscribers in the region.

The company reported earnings of $0.41 per share after the bell Monday on revenue of $3.29 billion, which sent the stock up over 10% in after hours trading.  Netflix has been adding more subscribers internationally than in the US in recent quarters, and this period was no exception. Netflix added a total of 8.33 million subscribers \u2014 2 million more than expected \u2014 with 1.45 million added from the US and 4.9 million internationally. Both measures were better than expected.  \"We had a beautiful Q4, completing a great year as internet TV expands globally,\" the company said in a letter to shareholders. \"In 2017, we grew streaming revenue 36% to over $11 billion, added 24 million new memberships (compared to 19 million in 2016), achieved for the first time a full-year positive international contribution profit, and more than doubled global operating income.\"  The growth has been fueled by mega-hits like \"Stranger Things 2.\" UBS analysts predicted last week that new shows from the fourth quarter, namely \"Ozark\" and \"Mindhunter,\" have generated just as much subscriber excitement as hits like \"House of Cards\" or \"Narcos.\"  Netflix warned that its free cash flow will be between $-3 billion and $-4 billion in 2018 as it invests to take on competitors who are rapidly launching their own competing streaming services, the largest of which being Disney. \"We are striving to make the right choices and investments to grow the value of the firm,\" the compay said \"and that is what also ultimately secures our debt. High yield has rarely seen an equity cushion so thick.\"  The spending should help Netflix stave off any new competition as other companies develop their own streaming products, namely Disney, which is already pulling its content from Netflix and plans to launch its own service in 2019.  \"The market for entertainment time is vast and can support many successful services,\" Netflix said. \"In addition, entertainment services are often complementary given their unique content offerings. We believe this is largely why both we and Hulu have been able to succeed and grow.\"  So far, this strategy appears to be paying off, with smash hit originals like \"Stranger Things\" continuing to draw in new subscribers and offset any pushback from the price hike that went into effect in the fourth-quarter.

The Asian market has been notoriously difficult for Western companies to break into due to the challenges of local rivals, protectionist regulations, and cultural barriers to surmount. But Netflix could find a way in through Japan.  Japan is one of the largest markets the video-streaming company has entered, and has been considered \"the vanguard of Netflix's entrance into Asia \u2014 a market with not only a large user base but also different cultural dynamics surrounding content streaming,\" according to RBC Analyst Mark Mahaney.  The Japanese market has been hard for streaming companies to crack into because it is usually ahead of the US in terms of technology, meaning there's already a plethora of established \"freemium\" options for consumers to choose from.  However, recent trends show that Netflix is gaining some traction in the country, which could set the stage for a deeper penetration into Asia.  Though only 5% of respondents to an RBC survey said they watched Netflix \u2014 up from 3% in February 2017 \u2014 63% of Japanese subscribers said they were \"Extremely\" or \"Very\" satisfied with Netflix, and a record-high 31% of Japanese subscribers said they were \"Extremely,\" \"Very,\" or \"Moderately\" likely to pay for the streaming service, compared with 24% in the same month a year ago.  \"We believe that these results highlight that Netflix\u2019s entry into Japan is still early, but materially improving,\" Mahaney said.  Mahaney also looked at Google Trends data across the continent and found there were \"consistent upward trends\" in search results for \"Netflix\" in 2017 and into 2018. There have been studies that found a correlation between Google searches of the term \"Netflix\" and Netflix viewership numbers.  \"2017 appears to have been an early pivot year for Netflix in Asia and 2018 is showing good momentum so far,\" Mahaney wrote in a note.  There is also an opportunity to appeal to this large segment of the global population through its slate of new and original content planned for this year, Mahaney says. Around 88% of Japanese respondents indicated that original content influenced their decision to use the service.  \"We believe these [numbers] indicate the broad appeal of Netflix\u2019s Original Content slate, not only across geographies but even across languages barriers,\" Mahaney added.

The yet-to-be-named comedy series will be released in packages throughout 2018, and will include a mix of newcomer and well-established comics. These specials add to Netflix's growing library of short-form content \u2014 the company added a 15-minute show from Fox Digital Studios in 2017, for example.  The short-form comedies release can help Netflix's aim of acquiring more mobile viewers. Mobile viewers prefer shorter, snackable content \u2014 47% of all mobile video viewing is on videos 20 minutes or shorter, while 39% of views go to content 5 minutes or shorter, according to Ooyala per Variety. Appealing to mobile users can help Netflix measure up to YouTube, which ranked first in terms of average monthly users across iPhone and Android in 2017.  Netflix's expansion into short-form contrasts Facebook's content strategy, which leans toward longer-form videos. Facebook announced it would begin prioritizing longer videos that drive repeat viewership in December 2017, as part of its larger strategy to cultivate more \"lean-back\" viewers for its Watch section. In contrast, Netflix's short-form push can help the company gain more casual mobile viewers, who are consuming short-form video on Facebook and YouTube instead.

Netflix shares are spiking Wednesday after the streaming giant announced a deal with Ryan Murphy, the producer of \"Glee\" and \"American Horror Story,\" reportedly worth up to $300 million over five years.  Netflix's stock is trading up more than 3% to above $266 a share. Netflix shares hit an all-time high of $284 in late January.  Murphy will remain with 21st Century Fox through the end of his current contract this summer, and Disney's pending acquisition of several Fox businesses was reportedly a factor in his decision to leave the traditional television studio for Netflix, according to The New York Times.  This is Netflix's latest move to steal top producers from traditional television in order to create original content as it competes with other streaming giants like Hulu, Apple, and Amazon. Last August, Netflix signed a deal with Shonda Rhimes, the producer behind ABC's hit shows \"Grey's Anatomy\" and \"Scandal.\"  Netflix said it will spend up to $8 billion this year on original content, which comes as no surprise to investors who have grown accustomed to Netflix's propensity to spend big.

Viewers often have positive feelings about Netflix movies and TV shows even before they've seen them, which should help the streaming giant keep a healthy pace in subscriber growth, Bernstein analyst Todd Juenger says.  Watch Netflix's stock move in real time here.  When video watchers hear Netflix is behind a movie or TV show, they most often conclude that it has to be good, or at least worth the minimal investment of time to check it out.  That positive association with Netflix's brand could be hard for competitors to beat, and could help justify its estimated $12 billion investment in original content.  \"The positive brand association Netflix has created among its members provides a positive halo for its content, giving Netflix a huge advantage because members are pre-disposed to think they will 'like' Netflix content, which usually becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy,\" wrote Todd Juenger, a Bernstein analyst.  With some of its recent successes, such as \"Bright,\" featuring Will Smith, the German production \"Dark,\" and the Oscar award-winning documentary, \"Icarus,\" Netflix has proven that it produces original content that will keep driving new and loyal subscribers back to its platform.  This is also helping the video streaming company draw some key Hollywood talent such as Ryan Murphy, the man behind \"American Horror Story\" and \"Glee,\" and Shonda Rhimes, the producer behind such hits as \"Grey's Anatomy\" and \"Scandal.\" The fact that Netflix is able to pull such high-profile names also keeps them away from competitors, Juenger notes.  \"While the price tag is high, the value of a 'hit show' for Netflix is also high, and it's nice to have your $12 billion in capable hands,\" Juenger said.  Netflix plans to spend billions of dollars on roughly 700 new original TV shows in 2018 as part of its strategy to build \"a global moat\" that would widen its competitive advantage, according to another Wall Street analyst.  In fact, investor confidence was so high for Netflix that a Stifel analyst downgraded the stock, claiming the \"share price may have sprinted ahead of fundamentals in the short-term.\"  Netflix was up 3.78% on Friday at $328.84 per share.

Kayenta is integrated into the Netflix-incubated Spinnaker continuous delivery platform, which works across virtually every public and private cloud. While Spinnaker is the focus of this release, though, Kayenta can also be adapted to other environments.  The general idea behind canary analysis is pretty straightforward. Like the name implies, this is an early warning system that is all about prevent major issues when you roll out an update to a service or your infrastructure. As you roll out an update to a subset of new users (or servers, or parts of your network), the canary analysis service checks whether the new system behaves as it should \u2014 or at least as well as the old one. At every step, the system performs its checks and ensures that you don\u2019t roll out an upgrade that may pass all of your regular tests but creates issues when thrown into a more complex production system.  As Google product manager Andrew Phillips told me, a lot of developers already do this, but it\u2019s often a rather informal process. Teams often build their apps, deploy it to a few servers, wait for a few minutes and then check their dashboards to look for obvious issues. That introduces the chance of human error and brings in the potential for bias. A canary analysis system, on the other hand, can evaluate the metrics and then (ideally) make an objective decision on whether the code is ready to ship or not. While most companies run automated tests to check their code for obvious errors, that kind of testing is often not enough when you want to put your code into production, especially if that production environment consists of a set of microservices that may end up interacting with each other in unexpected ways.  As is so often the case these days, with Kayenta, the Netflix team wants to open up its own system to bring the service to the wider community (and in return benefit from the community\u2019s advances, too). To do this, Netflix and Google also worked to rewrite the parts of Kayenta that were specific to Netflix, where the system grew rather organically. That doesn\u2019t necessarily make for good code, though, so with Kayenta, Google and Netflix also spent some time cleaning up the code and making it more modular. Indeed, as Netflix director of delivery engineering Andy Glover told me, the Google and Netflix teams spent about a year to get the code ready for today\u2019s release and one of the major areas of focus for both teams was making sure that the code was as modular as possible.  The fact that Google and Netflix already did some joint work on Spinnaker surely helped their efforts to get Kayenta off the ground, too. It also helps that canary analysis isn\u2019t exactly a competitive advantage for either company. As Phillips stressed, there is really no need for every enterprise to reinvent the wheel and this kind of project is all about \u201cgiving space-age tech to the masses.\u201d  Looking forward, the plan is to grow both the Kayenta and Spinnaker community. \u201cThe goodwill of Netflix and Google together has attracted a certain crowd of developers that have embraced Spinnaker,\u201d Glover noted. The Kayenta project will surely benefit from that. The Spinnaker Slack room already has over 4,000 participants, after all.  As Phillips also stressed, part of that interest is due to the simple fact that people need software delivery solutions and while there are plenty of options, a project that has the backing of Google and Netflix attracts a lot of attention by default. And given the backing of these two companies, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we saw some kind of commercial distribution of Spinnaker and Kayenta in the near future.", "stock": "NFLX", "label": 1, "date": "2018-04-10", "source": "techcrunch", "url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/04/10/google-and-netflix-team-up-to-launch-a-new-open-source-canary-analysis-tool/"}, {"article": "Another high-profile TV producer is going all-in with Netflix: Ryan Murphy has signed what the streaming service describes as \u201ca multi-year deal to produce new series and films exclusively at Netflix, starting July 1, 2018.\u201d  Murphy\u2019s credits include Glee, American Horror Story, American Crime Story and The Normal Heart.

We\u2019ll get to the financial numbers in a minute but, as usual, the big story here is that it continues to wow Wall Street with impressive growth in its subscriber numbers. The company said it added more than 8 million new subscribers total after already setting pretty robust targets for the fourth quarter this year, giving it a healthy push as it crossed the $100 billion mark after the report came out this afternoon.  Here\u2019s the rundown:  Netflix\u2019s biggest challenge has been to aggressively invest in good original content that\u2019s going to bring in new subscribers. While its shows may clean up at various awards shows like the Emmys, it still has to show that it can convert those awards into raw subscribers. But thanks to what appears to be continuing success with its original content like Stranger Things, as well other returning seasons for shows like The Crown, it\u2019s been able to continue its staggering run.  While the company\u2019s core financials actually came in roughly in line with what Wall Street was looking for (which is still important), Netflix\u2019s subscriber numbers are usually the best indicator for the core health of the company. That recurring revenue stream \u2014 and its growth \u2014 is critical as it continues to very aggressively spend on new content. The company said its free cash flow will be between negative $3 billion and negative $4 billion, compared to negative $2 billion this year.  And that aggressive spend only seems to get more aggressive every time we hear from the company. Netflix is now saying that it expects to spend between $7.5 billion and $8 billion on content in 2018 \u2014 which is around in line with what it said in October when it said it would spend between $7 billion and $8 billion. It\u2019s the same range, but tuning up that bottom end is still an important indicator.  Netflix shows picked up 20 Emmy awards last year, but just having a shiny object on a shelf isn\u2019t something that\u2019s going to indicate that the company is going to continue to grow at a healthy clip. In the face of an increasingly crowded market, Netflix has to demonstrate its ability to continue to offer lasting value for subscribers \u2014 especially as it continues to grow abroad. The company, of course, has plenty of benefits in terms of how it handles its shows when it makes them itself.

The roots of the company\u2019s bug hunting concept go back to 2013 when Netflix launched what it called a,\u201dresponsible vulnerability disclosure program.\u201d The idea continued to develop over the years and they launched a private bug bounty program on Bugcrowd in 2016. They started small with 100 researchers and today at the launch of the public program they have increased that number to 700, according to the blog post.  They report since inception they have been able to solve 145 issues, paying out a variety of bounties with the highest being $15,000. \u201cWe have attempted to fine tune things like triage quality, response time and researcher interactions to build a quality program that researchers like to participate in,\u201d the company wrote in the blog post announcing the program.  Netflix is far from alone in running these kinds of programs. Many big organizations like Facebook, Google and many others use bug bounty programs to pay researchers to find security holes on their platforms before black-hat hackers do. The idea is to provide financial incentive to find the bugs, rather than going in and exploiting the vulnerability for personal gain.  There is generally a leader board, so in addition to financial remuneration, the researcher also gets bragging rights and public acclaim for tracking down bugs. And it\u2019s not just traditional tech companies running these programs. General Motors has one running on the HackerOne platform and MasterCard has one on Bugcrowd.  Bugcrowd and other bug bounty platforms like HackerOne provide a way to administer the program, providing a way to recruit researchers, then letting them know which vulnerabilities they are looking for and how much they are willing to pay. To give you a sense of how lucrative these programs can be to hackers, Google released a report last month indicating it paid out almost $3 million in bounties last year with rewards ranging from $500 to $100,000.  Netflix is hoping to attract people who can similarly help them track bugs and keep their systems secure.

Nope, not by a long chalk\u2026  The European Commission is holding a press conference later today to trumpet progress made on ending \u201cunjustified geoblocking\u201d, as it tells it, with the stated aim of greasing the wheels of pan-EU ecommerce in time for Christmas.  Which, from a consumer point of view, sounds great. Unfortunately it\u2019s not quite as great as it sounds. Especially if you were imagining it would apply to popular digital media streaming services like Spotify and Netflix . Nope, sorry.  Geoblocks for digital media are not being vanquished in this round of EU Digital Single Market regulation chess.  What is being agreed by EU lawmakers is an end to geoblocks for the sale of goods and services \u2014 just not if the electronic services in question happen to be stuff like, er, streaming music, TV, video and so on\u2026  Don\u2019t be fooled if a speaker says that we abolished #geoblocking, though. We didn\u2019t. Only for buying goods & services, but not for digital media like videos, games, ebooks. Progress is slow. https://t.co/T9LnFEul1y \u2014 Julia Reda (@Senficon) February 5, 2018  A crumb of comfort on that front is last year agreement was reached among EU institutions on new rules around the portability of digital content for travelers \u2014 meaning that from this year EU citizens traveling across the 28 Member State bloc can now access the online media services which they have already subscribed to when they are on holiday in another EU country.  But if you want to actually subscribe to \u2014 and continuously consume \u2014 those sorts of audio-visual digital services across EU borders, well, you\u2019re going to be out of luck. Copyright being the major blocker here.  What does this mean in practice? Well, EU geoblocks are certainly alive and well if you try to sign up to \u2014 for example \u2014 Netflix from a different Member State to the EU country where you live (or where your bank cards were issued).  Or even if you attempt to buy a Spotify gift card for a person who lives in a different EU country to the country you do.  The digital service providers will simply deny these kind of transactions \u2014 and the notion of an EU \u2018digital single market\u2019 will be shown up as rather more aspiration than actual at this point. Nor is that situation going to change this year.  The Commission does know this \u2014 because it\u2019s at least making an attempt to address the regulatory dissonance. In September 2016 it proposed additional EU legislation aimed at facilitating the provision of cross-border audiovisual services.  But an EC spokeswoman confirmed to us that those provisions remain under negotiation.  And, as MEP Julia Reda tweeted yesterday, progress is slow. The progress-blocking culprit? Take a bow Hollywood et al\u2026  That\u2019s why we will still vote in favour. It\u2019s important to note though that also the Parliament position would have left copyright and licensing regimes completely intact. It\u2019s just excluded because nobody wants to fight the powerful entertainment industry. \u2014 Julia Reda (@Senficon) February 5, 2018  In a 2016 impact assessment document attached to the Commission\u2019s proposal \u2014 and specifically discussing the licensing of video on demand rights \u2014 the EC wrote that its preferred option \u201cincludes a European stakeholders\u2019 dialogue and a negotiation mechanism that would facilitate the conclusion of licences for the online exploitation of audiovisual works by removing contractual blockages\u201d.  Which is a long-winded way of saying they need to get the entertainment industry to agree to cross-border licensing. So, frankly speaking, I wouldn\u2019t hold your breath for the arrival of that truly seamless digital single market dream.  The EC\u2019s VP for the # DigitalSingleMarket recognized the problem in comments made at a plenary meeting yesterday \u2014 saying it intends to pay \u201cparticular attention\u201d to the \u201cnon-audio visual copyright protected services like software, games, e-books and music\u201d, and admitting the current regulation only partially covers this sort of digital content.  His comments also confirm that services like Netflix represent the hardest digital content cross-border portability problem to fix. (Even \u2014 and here\u2019s the consumer kicker \u2014 as they\u2019re likely to be the kind of services EU citizens really do want \u2018seamless\u2019 access to\u2026 )  What about #geoblocking of content protected by #copyright?  \u27a1\ufe0fWe'll review the scope of #geoblocking rules 2 years after entry into force  \u27a1\ufe0fI urge MEPs & Member States to agree on #satcab rules on cross-border access to audiovisual content online & keep level of ambition pic.twitter.com/AwMSi6cPxY \u2014 Andrus Ansip (@Ansip_EU) February 6, 2018  So, for the circa 20 million EU citizens the EC says were born in a different EU Member State from the one where they live now, there will be around three years\u2019 wait before the Commission is even going to take a closer look at the kind of geoblocks they\u2019re still being saddled with.  And the Christmas 2018 consolation prize of a partial end to geoblocks is just that: A piecemeal offer that doesn\u2019t change much.  Instead of seamless cross-border access to popular streaming media services this year, EU citizens might be able to shop online for physical goods from another EU Member State which they then have to go and pick up themselves (or arrange their own shipping).  They may also be able to purchase an electronic service like web hosting from another Member State without having to pay any additional fees (though not necessarily obtaining the service at the same price).  And they could perhaps be able to purchase a service provided in a specific physical location without being redirected to a local website to do so.  All thanks to the Commission\u2019s \u2018unjustified geoblocks\u2019 regulation. (\u2018Might\u2019, \u2018may\u2019 and \u2018could\u2019 because the EC notes the regulation does not impose an obligation on companies to sell. Nor does it harmonise prices, as noted above.)  The point of this piecemeal regulation, says the EC, is to address discrimination in access to goods and services \u201cin cases where it cannot be objectively justified (e.g. by VAT obligations or different legal requirements)\u201d.  It\u2019s just a shame it\u2019s the Commission has failed to embrace a meaningful reform of digital copyright rules across the bloc.

The changes are notable in light of Disney\u2019s planned entry in the streaming market in 2019, when it will launch a Netflix competitor, specifically aimed at families, and lacking R-rated content.  Netflix already offers a fairly robust set of parental controls, which followed the company\u2019s decision to focus more on kids, with launch of its \u201cKids\u201d user interface back in 2011. In addition to setting up individual profiles for each Netflix user in a household, parents could also set PIN controls for all content at a given maturity level. For example, anything rated \u201cAdults\u201d (R, NC-17, NR, UR) could be set to require a PIN code in order to view it.  Now, Netflix is adding the option to set PIN codes by individual movies and series, to give parents more control over specific items.  This decision may have been inspired by the controversy surrounding Netflix\u2019s series, \u201c13 Reasons Why,\u201d which tackled issues like sexual assault and suicide. While some parents believed the series helped them have difficult conversations with their teens about these important topics, other parents (and some mental health experts) said it glorified suicide, and was \u201cdangerous.\u201d  This series is precisely the sort of thing parents want to choose if (or when) their children watch; and they\u2019d like to make that decision without necessarily having to set system-wide PIN controls.  In addition to the new PIN option, Netflix says it will also now display the maturity level rating for a series or film once the title begins to play. This will appear at the top-left corner, and will bring increased visibility to the content\u2019s intended audience and why it received that rating (e.g. language, sexual content, etc.).  Ratings have become even more helpful in the streaming era, when so much new content is released on a regular basis, much of its originals, all of which is available in one destination \u2013 the streaming service itself. In the cable era, kids content would generally be found on its own channel, which made knowing what\u2019s appropriate a lot easier.  Netflix says it\u2019s also exploring other ways to make information about ratings more descriptive and easier for users to understand at a glance \u2013 which could signal more user interface tweaks are still ahead.  The move to enhance parental controls is likely only one of the ways Netflix is preparing to do battle with Disney, who will both be competing for subscribers with children.

This Gravity meets Event Horizon flick mashes up the scariest things outside our planet to provide an answer. A new Netflix original film, \u201cThe Cloverfield Paradox,\u201d is now available after a surprise announcement during the Super Bowl. Producer J.J. Abrams is back for a third-installment that\u2019s tense and eerie, leaving you worrying how far director Julius Onah will push the frights.  The Cloverfield Paradox explores a world set to run out of energy in five years. A space station is created to test an experimental particle accelerator that could generate enough power to solve the crisis. But turning it on unleashes terrifying, reality-warping changes.  The film follows 2008\u2019s found monster footage collage Cloverfield, and 2016\u2019s 10 Cloverfield Lane, where survivors end up losing their minds in a shelter. But while those films felt zoomed into a tight set of characters, The Cloverfield Paradox encompasses a whole earth on the brink of panic.  Trapped on the space station, the film does meander a bit, but the spooky occurrences it pursues add to the film\u2019s overwhelming atmosphere of disorientation. It never fully forges a connection between the audience and many of the characters, though star Gugu Mbatha-Raw handles intense emotional weight as a grieving crew member.  Those looking to geek out on the science of global warming worst case scenarios will find The Cloverfield Paradox tantalizing. There are a few unresolved phenomena that are unnecessary, but it\u2019s powerful to see the crew crack under the pressure of a world looking to be saved.  The Cloverfield Paradox stumbles trying to cram climactic action into its claustrophobic quarters. This isn\u2019t an action blockbuster by any means. But an entertaining ending makes you want another film in the series back on the ground.  Netflix has managed to launch both a passable one-off, and a movie that keep Abrams fans subscribed until they can get another Cloverfield fix. And by announcing the previously delayed film would be available just two hours after its trailer debuted, Netflix shows its agile nature.

Mr. Rock\u2019s booming act has always been built for bigger rooms, but he goes smaller for this special, with the help of the comic Bo Burnham, whose artfully idiosyncratic direction emphasizes intimacy and studiously avoids clich\u00e9. The show begins with a casual shot of the back of Mr. Rock\u2019s head while he is chatting backstage and ends abruptly. When the star drops the microphone, Mr. Burnham fades to black before we hear the familiar sound of it hitting the floor.

And then there\u2019s the cast, which includes \u201980s stars like Corey Feldman, Corey Haim, Alex Winter, Dianne Wiest and Kiefer Sutherland, as the leader of the vampire pack.  \u2014  Michelle Pfeiffer and Al Pacino in \u201cScarface.\u201d Universal Pictures, via Everett Collection  \u2018Scarface\u2019  Starts streaming: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  This is the Brian De Palma movie that launched a handful of catchphrases, many bad Al Pacino impressions and countless movie posters on dorm rooms across the country. Written by Oliver Stone, the film follows the ruthless Cuban gangster Tony Montana as he climbs his way up from being a low-level hood to ruling a slice of the Miami drug scene in the decadent \u201980s. In his perverted sense of the American dream, nothing is off limits. It\u2019s a mentality that eventually leads to so many scenes of violence and drug use that it makes \u201cMiami Vice\u201d look like a kid\u2019s show.  \u2014  Netflix Original TV Series  A scene from \u201cChef\u2019s Table: Pastry.\u201d Martin Westlake/Netflix  \u2018Chef\u2019s Table: Pastry\u2019  Starts streaming: April 13  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  TV\u2019s prettiest-looking cooking series gets its second spinoff, focused on four of the world\u2019s most acclaimed dessert-makers: the Milk Bar\u2019s Christina Tosi, Room 4\u2019s Will Goldfarb, El Celler de Can Roca\u2019s Jordi Roca and Caff\u00e8 Sicilia\u2019s Corrado Assenza. As always, expect the director-producer David Gelb and his crew to combine these chefs\u2019 philosophical ruminations with drool-worthy images of food.  \u2014  Parker Posey in \u201cLost in Space.\u201d Netflix  \u2018Lost in Space\u2019 Season 1  Starts streaming: April 13  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Although it only ran for three seasons in the 1960s, the family-friendly science-fiction series \u201cLost in Space\u201d has maintained a steady presence in popular culture, thanks largely to its memorable characters and endearingly wonky science. Netflix\u2019s new remake appears to be keeping most of what worked the first time out, albeit with updated special effects and a more modern outlook on gender roles. The comically dour Dr. Smith, for example \u2014 played by Jonathan Harris in the original \u2014 is a woman in this version, and she\u2019s played by a cleverly cast Parker Posey.  \u2014  Robert F.

Kennedy\u2019s life, career and death have been covered extensively in documentaries, movie dramas, and TV mini-series, much more than his brother Robert\u2019s political career and assassination. The four-hour docu-series \u201cBobby Kennedy for President\u201d is an effort to correct that imbalance, using the landmark cultural moment of Kennedy\u2019s 1968 White House run \u2014 and its abrupt, tragic end \u2014 as a lens through which to observe what he stood for and what he meant to a generation of young idealists.  \u2014  Also of interest: \u201cThe Boss Baby: Back in Business\u201d Season 1 (April 6), \u201cThe Magic School Bus Rides Again\u201d Season 2 (April 13), \u201cThe Chalet\u201d Season 1 (April 17), \u201cDope\u201d Season 2 (April 20).

Franco is a heroin addict suffering through a relapse and Jacobson is the hyper-organized, strait-laced sister who spends one long, tense day trying to get him the help he needs while also making sure that his life isn\u2019t totally upended \u2014 two goals that aren\u2019t necessarily compatible.  \u2014  Chiwetel Ejiofor in \u201cCome Sunday.\u201d Tina Rowden/Netflix  \u2018Come Sunday\u2019  Starts streaming: April 13  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Chiwetel Ejiofor gives one of the best performances of his long, accomplished career in \u201cCome Sunday,\u201d playing the real-life evangelical minister Carlton Pearson, who around the turn of the millennium began preaching \u201cthe Gospel of Inclusion,\u201d arguing that Jesus Christ had saved everyone regardless of a person\u2019s religious beliefs. Directed by Joshua Marston and written by Marcus Hinchey, the film is intended as a bracing challenge to fervent Christian believers, asking them to consider the true purpose of their faith.  \u2014  From left, Ed Harris, Elizabeth Olsen and Jason Sudeikis in \u201cKodachrome.\u201d Christos Kalohoridis/Netflix  \u2018Kodachrome\u2019  Starts streaming: April 20  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Based on a true story, the indie dramedy \u201cKodachrome\u201d stars Ed Harris as a cranky, ill old man who takes a road trip with his compassionate nurse (Elizabeth Olsen) and his estranged son (Jason Sudeikis), in order to drop off some undeveloped rolls of film at the last lab in the country that can process them. Similarities to the recent Oscar nominee \u201cNebraska\u201d are unmistakable, but this move has its own tone and rhythm, paying off in some satisfyingly emotional moments.  \u2014  0  A scene from \u201cMercury 13.\u201d via Netflix  \u2018Mercury 13\u2019  Starts streaming: April 20  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  In 1960, not long after NASA publicly announced the names of the seven pilots who became the first American men in space \u2014 the so-called Mercury Seven \u2014 a private organization started recruiting women to undergo some of the same psychological and physical tests administered to those men. The purpose: to see if the challenges of flying beyond Earth\u2019s atmosphere differed by gender. The documentary \u201cMercury 13\u201d is a look into this lesser-known project, considering the way the codified sexism of the post-World War II era denied a one-of-a-kind opportunity to some would-be (and perfectly capable) adventurers.  \u2014  Chris Rock, left, and Adam Sandler in \u201cThe Week Of.\u201d Netflix  \u2018The Week Of\u2019  Sarts streaming: April 27  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  For the most part, the movies that Adam Sandler has delivered to Netflix as part of his recent four-picture deal have been embarrassingly broad. But there\u2019s reason to hope that this last film in the batch will be the best \u2014 in part because it is directed by the incisive veteran comic Robert Smigel (who also wrote the film with Sandler), and in part because it also stars Sandler\u2019s old \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d castmate Chris Rock. Sandler and Rock play parents who spend an anxious seven days leading up to their kids\u2019 wedding. Rachel Dratch and Steve Buscemi also star, in a film that could potentially hearken to more emotionally complex Sandler projects like \u201cThe Wedding Singer.\u201d  \u2014  Also of interest: \u201cThe 4th Company\u201d (April 6), \u201cAmateur\u201d (April 6), \u201cOrbiter 9\u201d (April 6), \u201cPickpockets\u201d (April 12), \u201cDude\u201d (April 20), \u201cPsychokinesis\u201d (April 25) and \u201cCandy Jar\u201d (April 27).

In the not-too-distant future (1997 \u2014 the film was released in 1981), Air Force One crash lands in the prison colony of Manhattan, and Plissken is enlisted to rescue the president before the crooks who kidnapped him seek revenge. Along with \u201cThe Thing,\u201d this is one of the best 1980s collaborations between Russell and the movie\u2019s director, John Carpenter. Between Russell\u2019s gruff macho-man character, exaggerated villains and dystopian view of New York City, this movie is pretty out there. Breaking up all the seriousness, the classic-movie star Ernest Borgnine shows up for comic relief as an old-school cabdriver looking to help Plissken with his mission.  \u2014  Robert De Niro in \u201cThe King of Comedy.\u201d 20th Century Fox  \u2018The King of Comedy\u2019  Starts streaming: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  In his mind, Rupert Pupkin (Robert De Niro) is a TV star, and he\u2019ll do just about anything to make his dream come true \u2014 including stalking and kidnapping. This is perhaps one of Martin Scorsese\u2019s more understated movies. It doesn\u2019t have the same amount of violence that movies like \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d or \u201cGoodfellas\u201d have. It\u2019s a psychological drama that is tense and sometimes tragically funny.  \u2014  Michelle Pfeiffer and Alec Baldwin in \u201cMarried to the Mob.\u201d MGM  \u2018Married to the Mob\u2019  Starts streaming: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Angela de Marco (Michelle Pfeiffer) has a husband in the mafia (a young and dashing Alec Baldwin), and she wants out. Unfortunately, leaving the mob is harder than breaking a marriage, and Angela is left to defend for herself from gangsters and the feds. The premise sounds bleak, but \u201cMarried to the Mob\u201d is a lively Jonathan Demme romantic comedy that gives Pfeiffer a chance to play for laughs. It\u2019s funny but poignant, bubbly but still dark at times \u2014 all in equal measure so nothing is out of whack.  \u2014  A scene from \u201cParanormal Activity.\u201d Paramount Pictures  \u2018Paranormal Activity\u2019  Starts streaming: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  This is the low-budget found-footage horror film that helped kick off a craze in the late 2000s. Suspecting there\u2019s something strange lurking in their new home, a young couple sets up stationary cameras to capture whatever might be creeping around at night. But the cause of the disturbances is more terrifying than they anticipated. For best results, watch this movie at night, right before you go to bed.  \u2014  Sally Field, left, and Julia Roberts in \u201cSteel Magnolias.\u201d TriStar Pictures  \u2018Steel Magnolias\u2019  Starts streaming: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  This is both a great mother-daughter movie and a good one to watch with girlfriends. \u201cSteel Magnolias\u201d is about a group of women in the South and the many highs and lows of their collective experiences. The central story follows a hard-to-please mother (Sally Field) and her diabetic daughter (Julia Roberts), who despite her fragile health still wants kids. Field and Roberts are amazing, but there isn\u2019t a bad performer in a cast that includes Shirley MacLaine, Daryl Hannah, Olympia Dukakis and Dolly Parton in one of her best onscreen roles.  \u2014  Chavela Vargas as seen in \u201cChavela.\u201d Music Box Films  \u2018Chavela\u2019  Starts streaming: April 2  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  For those not familiar with the Mexican musician Chavela Vargas, let this inspiring documentary be your guide. She was a pants-wearing pioneer in an era when Mexican women didn\u2019t sing ranchera music onstage without wearing super frilly dresses. But Vargas ditched the costume, picked up a guitar and sang haunting songs of longing and loss. This documentary goes to great lengths to explain the mysterious Vargas through old interviews and recordings, but it can sometimes feel as if she\u2019s just out of reach. She\u2019s keeping some secrets to herself.  \u2014  0  From left, Christopher Rivera, Brooklynn Prince and Valeria Cotto in \u201cThe Florida Project.\u201d A24  \u2018The Florida Project\u2019  Starts streaming: April 6  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Sean Baker made a splash at Sundance a few years ago with \u201cTangerine,\u201d a sun-drenched, foul-mouthed comedy starring two transgender actresses and shot with an iPhone. His follow-up, \u201cThe Florida Project,\u201d is no less daring. Set amid a string of pastel-colored roadside motels in Orlando, Fla., just outside the Happiest Place on Earth, the movie follows a precocious 6-year-old troublemaker named Moonee (Brooklynn Prince) as she and her friends wreak havoc and her quick-tempered mother (Bria Vinaite) tries to keep up with the rent. Willem Dafoe gives a career-best performance as their motel\u2019s beleaguered manager, who becomes a kind of surrogate father to Moonee.  \u2014  Also of interest: \u201cBasic Instinct\u201d (April 1), \u201cCarrie\u201d (April 1), \u201cFor a Few Dollars More\u201d (April 1), \u201cFriday the 13th\u201d (April 1), \u201cThe Karate Kid\u201d (April 1), \u201cMarathon Man\u201d (April 1), \u201cMystic River\u201d (April 1), \u201cPhiladelphia\u201d (April 1), \u201cProject Nim\u201d (April 1) and \u201cSpaceballs\u201d (April 1).  New to Hulu  Nicolas Cage in \u201cCon Air.\u201d Touchstone Pictures  \u2018Con Air\u2019  Starts streaming: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  It is difficult to pick the movie with the best Nicolas Cage reaction shots, but this bombastic Jerry Bruckheimer movie from 1997 is near the top. In it, Cage plays a convict and former soldier who is on his way out of jail when the plane he is on gets hijacked by his fellow inmates. Of course, it wouldn\u2019t be a \u201990s Cage action movie without lots of fighting, over-the-top explosions and some pithy one-liners.  \u2014  Meryl Streep in \u201cDeath Becomes Her.\u201d Mary Evans/Universal Pictures, via Everett Collection  \u2018Death Becomes Her\u2019  Starts streaming: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Meryl Streep is at her funniest in this little black comedy about jealousy and magic. In it, Streep plays Madeline, a gorgeous movie star who steals the handsome fianc\u00e9 (Bruce Willis) of the much plainer Helen (Goldie Hawn), thus setting a disastrous course for both women. Their jealousy drives them to dark magic, which has some interesting physical side effects. \u201cDeath Becomes Her\u201d has a lighthearted, macabre sense of humor, full of morbid slapstick stunts and neck-twisting pratfalls. But it is also a bittersweet comedy about female friendships and impossible beauty standards.  \u2014  From left, Omar Sharif and Peter O\u2019Toole in \u201cLawrence of Arabia.\u201d Columbia Pictures  \u2018Lawrence of Arabia\u2019  Starts streaming: April 1  April 1 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  This 1962 war epic from director David Lean is on a lot of \u201cbest movies\u201d lists \u2014 and with good reason. The film is among the best of its genre, with its sweeping views of windswept battlegrounds and its penetrating look into the ways that war drives men mad. It\u2019s the story of T.E. Lawrence, who during World War I goes from being an insubordinate officer to a troubled leader. \u201cLawrence of Arabia\u201d is celebrated for Lean\u2019s stunning direction, for Maurice Jarre\u2019s unforgettable score, for Anne V. Coates\u2019s brilliant editing and for its remarkable cast, which includes Peter O\u2019Toole, Omar Sharif, Alec Guinness and Claude Raines. Don\u2019t let the three-and-a-half-hour run time scare you off. Just put the movie on the biggest screen you can find, and make enough popcorn to get you to the intermission.  \u2014  Sarah Polley in \u201cStories We Tell.\u201d Roadside Attractions  \u2018Stories We Tell\u2019  Starts streaming: April 1  April 1 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Although it is classified as a documentary, this deeply personal film from Sarah Polley almost feels like a work of fiction. But it isn\u2019t. As Polley peels back the layers of her own family\u2019s history, there\u2019s a kind of \u201cRashomon\u201d effect that happens as old family myths unravel and stories shift perspective. What results is a touching and breathtaking investigation into ideas of family, narrative and memory.  \u2014  Also of interest: \u201cCarrie\u201d (April 1), \u201cFor a Few Dollars More\u201d (April 1), \u201cFriday the 13th\u201d (April 1), \u201cMarried to the Mob\u201d (April 1), \u201cParanormal Activity\u201d (April 1), \u201cProject Nim\u201d (April 1), \u201cSpaceballs\u201d (April 1), \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d (April 1), \u201cLife is Beautiful\u201d (April 15) and \u201cLoving Vincent\u201d (April 19).

The chauvinist boss to the characters played by Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton is one of the worst onscreen employers in moviedom. After so many degrading incidents, the women get their righteous revenge on him, serving him a well-overdue comeuppance. The three women are wonderful together, and \u201cGrace and Frankie\u201d fans will really get a kick out of seeing an early pairing of Tomlin and Fonda.  \u2014  0  Harvey Stephens in \u201cThe Omen.\u201d 20th Century Fox  \u2018The Omen\u2019  Starts streaming: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  There are certain movies that make you happy that you don\u2019t have kids. If you are a parent already, then be happy that your child isn\u2019t the actual spawn of Satan, like the creepy child at the center of \u201cThe Omen.\u201d This original 1976 version stars Gregory Peck as the adoptive father of a demon boy who brings him hell. There are sequels, of course, but nothing gets quite as unnerving as watching the original Son of Satan scare the daylights out of Peck.  \u2014  From left, Lew Temple, Keri Russell and Cheryl Hines in \u201cWaitress.\u201d Alan Markfield/Fox Searchlight  \u2018Waitress\u2019  Starts streaming: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Written and directed by Adrienne Shelly, \u201cWaitress\u201d is a comedy-drama about a young mom-to-be (Keri Russell) who wants out of her small town and her loveless marriage. Things get complicated when she falls for her doctor (Nathan Fillion), but she sees her real future in making pies. The premise sounds a little cheesy, but Russell is endearing in her role and carries the story well. Recently, this sweet and empowering movie became the inspiration for a popular Broadway musical.  \u2014  Elvis Presley HBO  \u2018Elvis Presley: The Searcher\u2019 Parts 1 and 2  Starts streaming: April 14  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Calling all Elvis Presley fans.

While the documentary may retread a number of familiar stories \u2014 like how evil and exploitive Elvis\u2019s manager could be \u2014 it provides many lesser-known treasures as well, including archival rarities and interviews with fans, loved ones and the man himself. It also explores Elvis\u2019s musical influences and blues history, which many earlier films about him skip.

Thus truly began a long-promised deluge of what the kids call \u201ccontent,\u201d and just how much original content Netflix will put up before the year is over is something not even Netflix can say.  The influx of original programs coincides with news reports about Netflix\u2019s thorny relationship with cinema. The Cannes Film Festival, making good on a pledge last year, has codified its ban on Netflix-produced films in its competition. (If it\u2019s a Netflix movie, it will not screen in competition.) This is because of what Cannes regards as Netflix\u2019s intransigence about showing its films in theaters. Add to that a recent interview with the director Steven Spielberg in which he said that films produced by Netflix and other streaming platforms ought not to be eligible for Oscar consideration but compete for the Emmy Awards instead. That brings the immortal question \u201cWhat Is Cinema?\u201d to the forefront yet again. Along with it are the debates over the ostensibly sacrosanct value of the Communal Theatrical Experience.  It\u2019s not this column\u2019s job to provide definitive answers to the questions these debates raise.

Last season we shot in the winter, and it got darker in many ways. And now in Season 5, even more than in 4, it\u2019s very much more serialized and intense, while still obviously maintaining comedy first. It goes deeper than we ever have in the friendship.  Amy Poehler is an executive producer of the show. And until this coming season, so was her manager, Dave Becky, who has been criticized for ignoring sexual misconduct allegations against his client Louis C.K.  It just didn\u2019t feel right to have his name on a show that represents the exact opposite of what was going on with Louis.  Do you have your own #MeToo moment?  I don\u2019t have a major story particularly to tell, but there are so many stories within my story. The world of comedy is definitely a boys\u2019 club. And looking back, Ilana and I were so caught up in making this show that we had blinders on \u2014 that along the way there were things constantly happening. Reasons why the show wouldn\u2019t work here, wouldn\u2019t work there. People taking us seriously or not. Being the bosses in the workplace and treated differently than if we were men. For me it\u2019s these many, many, many things accumulating to, like, an \u201cOh!\u201d It\u2019s bringing to light so much where I used to think, \u201cThat\u2019s the norm, that\u2019s how things work here.\u201d And now it\u2019s like, \u201cNo, they don\u2019t, and they\u2019re not going to \u2014 at least on projects that I\u2019m involved in on a higher level.\u201d  Early on, you and Ilana described your characters as being 15 percent more exaggerated than your real selves. Five seasons in, what\u2019s your number?  I actually think it\u2019s way more now. In an amazing and very necessary way, personally I need her [laughs] \u2014 Abbi on the show \u2014 to be different from me. It\u2019s funny that I say that, because the core is the same. I get to blow up my insecurities and my fears and my flaws for the show. But I yearn for us to be different because it\u2019s so exposing and vulnerable and scary to have this person. I\u2019m living a double life, you know?  But then, even in Season 5, some of the biggest things that happen are so me and so directly my life that \u2014 yeah, I just negated what I said about making her different. Because at the end of the day, the character has to be pulled from my reality. And as you can tell, it\u2019s a very confusing and constantly wild ride over here!", "stock": "NFLX", "label": 1, "date": "2018-04-06", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/06/arts/television/abbi-jacobson-broad-city-6-balloons-netflix.html"}, {"article": "Think of Netflix as the Upside Down in its sci-fi series \u201cStranger Things.\u201d By this I don\u2019t mean that it\u2019s a nefarious or dangerous force. But it is a kind of alternative TV dimension, overlaying and replicating the known world of traditional television, that tries to acquire one of everything that exists in the universe of TV.  Initially, the company did this through literal acquisition: buying streaming rights to hit TV series. Then it did it through imitation: reviving Fox\u2019s \u201cArrested Development\u201d and creating originals, like \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d in the mold of premium cable. Now it\u2019s imitating through acquisition, spiriting away the likes of Mr. Murphy and Ms. Rhimes to its well-remunerated plane.  The history of TV is one of upstarts and competitors, and my first instinct was to liken Netflix to something like cable, which rose as a serious competitor to broadcast TV in the 1980s.  But there\u2019s an important difference between cable channels and Netflix (besides whom you write your check to). Cable channels have brands. That was what made them different from broadcast networks, which tried to be, and had to be, everything. Cable channels had specialties and sensibilities: CNN was news; ESPN was sports; HBO was adult sophistication (give or take an \u201cEntourage\u201d).  Photo  A cable brand might evolve \u2014 Bravo went from an arts channel to the \u201cReal Housewives\u201d channel \u2014 but the idea was to offer a specific aesthetic to a specific audience.  Netflix doesn\u2019t have that; in fact, it is specifically anti-that. Its brand is \u201cstuff that you like to watch on TV.\u201d It developed a vast library of reruns, and with that, a proprietary trove of data on who likes to watch what and how much. Then it made more of that, or bought it. If you liked \u201c30 Rock,\u201d here\u2019s \u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.\u201d If you liked \u201cDamages,\u201d here\u2019s \u201cBloodline.\u201d  Look at just the past few months of Netflix programming. There\u2019s \u201cThe Crown,\u201d a BBC-style historical drama. \u201cWormwood,\u201d an Errol Morris docudrama. \u201cOne Day at a Time,\u201d a 21st-century reboot of a 1970s network TV multicamera sitcom. \u201cDirty Money,\u201d a \u201cFrontline\u201d-esque documentary anthology. \u201cShe\u2019s Gotta Have It,\u201d a risqu\u00e9 romantic comedy. \u201cMy Next Guest Needs No Introduction,\u201d a David Letterman interview series. Oh, and why not \u2014 let\u2019s throw in a \u201cCloverfield\u201d sequel and a Will Smith movie.

The obvious analogy, then, is that Netflix isn\u2019t cable at all; it\u2019s a broadcaster, pitching a big tent.  But, as I\u2019ve written before, there\u2019s one very important difference. Broadcasters, whose advertising model required millions of eyeballs on every individual show, had to make sure that everything they aired appealed to a broad range of people.  That business imperative had aesthetic results: It gave us family sitcoms and comfort-food cop dramas. It\u2019s less true today, in the era of smaller audiences \u2014 but it\u2019s still much more true of NBC than, say, of IFC.

It\u2019s selling a platform to everyone, but by providing products for very specific tastes.  Netflix assumes a future in which we\u2019re watching our faves on our own screens, rather than gathering around an electronic fireplace \u2014 and as long as the monthly payment clears, it\u2019s all the same to the company. It\u2019s less a big tent than a Dothraki tent city, to borrow a metaphor from \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d  What does this mean for Ryan Murphy and Shonda Rhimes? Maybe not much at all. They were both powerful producers with a lot of freedom who will now have a lot of freedom and more money.  Photo  Mr. Murphy was, in a way, the Netflix-iest of producers to begin with: He\u2019d made everything from a broadcast network sitcom (\u201cThe New Normal\u201d) to an action show (\u201c9-1-1\u201d) to a marquee cable drama (\u201cFeud\u201d) to an HBO film (\u201cThe Normal Heart\u201d). He may be able to branch out even more, but he was hardly fettered.  What Ms. Rhimes does at Netflix will be interesting. She\u2019s the consummate network TV producer, having essentially defined the current voice of ABC with \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d and \u201cScandal.\u201d  She might do something very different with the license of streaming \u2014 but if she doesn\u2019t, that will fit in all the same at Netflix, which resurrected the broadcast favorite \u201cGilmore Girls\u201d with much the same tone, give or take a few curse words. One curious thing about Netflix is that every sensibility \u2014 niche and mass, G-rated and NSFW \u2014 exists on the same platform and the same plane.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Is all the deal-making worth it? Whether Netflix is emptying its deep pockets wisely by making itself into a Hall of Fame for established stars (see also Dave Chappelle) isn\u2019t my concern as a TV critic.  What I do care about is whether Netflix can nurture original, distinctive art, especially if it continues growing into a huge, all-encompassing alterna-TV.  And I worry whether it can do that when derivation is the business strategy itself: selling people new versions of things they already like. It\u2019s fine that Netflix can toss around enough money to reactivate David Letterman. But does it have the kind of culture that could discover a new David Letterman?  In its short life as an original programmer. Netflix has made a few series I\u2019d consider legitimately great. But most of them have involved making deals with creators with limited track records (\u201cBoJack Horseman,\u201d \u201cAmerican Vandal\u201d) or talented artists relatively new to creating series (\u201cMaster of None,\u201d \u201cLady Dynamite\u201d). (As I\u2019ve also written before, these shows tend to be comedies, which may translate more directly and easily to the streaming format.)  A more familiar experience on Netflix is the good-enough version of a drama you\u2019ve seen elsewhere. \u201cGodless,\u201d say, was a perfectly decent dark western, but no \u201cDeadwood.\u201d \u201cStranger Things\u201d is a joy, but it\u2019s a pastiche by design: It\u2019s the Netflix ethos in story form, reproducing and remixing memories in ways that tickle just the right nostalgia pleasure centers.  It may be that Netflix\u2019s approach means more competence and fewer out-and-out stinkers. And I have no reason to believe that Mr. Murphy and Ms. Rhimes will become any less creative because Netflix backed up a money truck.  But if Netflix is truly becoming a parallel TV universe, I hope its algorithm finds room for the experimental and untried.

The restaurant visits and chef interviews are broken up with fake commercials, animations, film clips and parodies of Japanese TV comedies or the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d Julia-Child-bleeds-out skit. The season finale is structured as a debate between Mr. Chang and the chef Mario Carbone over the relative merits of Italian filled pastas and Asian dumplings.  These techniques, and a generous Netflix budget, are on display in the pizza episode, which was filmed in Brooklyn, Tokyo, New Haven, Copenhagen, Naples, Los Angeles and Las Vegas. Demonstrating his trademark contrarianism, Mr. Chang praises Domino\u2019s \u2014 even donning the company vest and delivering pies \u2014 and declares New Haven and then Tokyo as the homes of the world\u2019s best pizza.  The visual curlicues and the attempts to impose a larger thematic structure and narrative \u2014 there\u2019s an awful lot of tired talk about how food tells stories \u2014 don\u2019t hide the reality that there isn\u2019t a whole lot new or surprising about \u201cUgly Delicious.\u201d (The exception: the openness with which it discusses racism as a fundamental force in culinary culture.) Its primary influence, as with other food shows, will probably be to max out reservations at impossibly cool-looking restaurants like the Tokyo pizzeria Seirinkan or the locavorish Salare in Seattle.  What the show is really selling is the Chang attitude and mystique, a combination of ego, exactitude, foul-mouthed rebelliousness and self-deprecatory nerdiness. With the opening of Momofuku Noodle Bar 14 years ago, he fortuitously caught the waves of both millennial casualness and fangirl-fanboy-style fetishization (of ingredients, of methods, of chefs) that swept through the restaurant business.

View all New York Times newsletters.  An important part of Mr. Chang\u2019s persona at the start was his outsider status, casting stones at (or at least making withering remarks about) the bastions of haute cuisine where he had learned his trade. That became problematic as he built an international restaurant empire that recently added the 200-plus-seat Momofuku Las Vegas.  And in \u201cUgly Delicious\u201d he moves with a band of insiders that includes Mr. Meehan, the superstar Danish chef Ren\u00e9 Redzepi and Mr. Ansari, Mr. Chang\u2019s fellow Netflix star. It\u2019s also a boy\u2019s club. An episode about home cooking is the only one with an equal representation of women and men among the significant speaking roles. In all the others men outnumber women by 2 or 3 to 1; in the pizza episode it\u2019s 8 to 1. This may reflect the state of affairs in the food industry, but it\u2019s surprising for a series that wants to talk about diversity and representation.  (African-American chefs and commentators are even less present, appearing almost exclusively in an episode about the coded meanings and cultural signifiers of fried chicken.)  The show often allows Mr. Chang\u2019s rough edges to show, and sometimes its picture of him is unflattering in ways that don\u2019t seem intentional. His jibes can cross over into meanness, and his pontifications can appear oblivious, as when he compares the art of barbecue to the art of jazz in an episode focused entirely on white and Asian cooks.  \u201cI don\u2019t know how the hell it all happened,\u201d Mr. Chang says, contemplating the franchise that he has become. The claim seems unlikely, and one way to see the show, with its focus on pizza and tacos and dumplings, is as a branding exercise \u2014 a pivot away from high-intensity cooking toward the ugly deliciousness of comfort food. The penultimate episode ends with him holding a plate of kimchi and Spam fried rice toward the camera.

A scene from \u201cJaws.\u201d Universal Pictures  \u2018Jaws\u2019  Leaving Netflix: March 1  : March 1 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  This 1975 horror thriller from Steven Spielberg did nothing less than revolutionize the movie industry \u2014 once studio executives realized exactly how much money could be made by a single summer blockbuster, it changed the way movies were released and advertised. But that\u2019s not the reason to see it (or see it again); it was a hit then, and it has endured for more than four decades because it is a masterfully constructed adventure ride, filled with bruising set pieces, eerily convincing effects, quotable dialogue (they are, in fact, gonna need a bigger boat), and memorable characters. Ultimately, we care about this ragtag crew of would-be shark hunters, which renders their breathless encounters with the great white all them more compelling.  \u2014  Guy Pearce in \u201cMemento.\u201d Danny Rothenberg/Newmarket Films  \u2018Memento\u2019  Leaving Netflix: March 1  : March 1 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Christopher Nolan\u2019s second feature \u2014 and first big hit \u2014 is an expertly constructed windup toy of a movie, spinning an exhilarating 113 minutes out of a fairly simple premise: A man with short-term memory loss (Guy Pearce), tries to solve his wife\u2019s murder. But Nolan augments the storytelling with an appropriate stylistic flourish, presenting it in reverse chronological order, so that in each new scene, the viewer is as uncertain about what\u2019s happening as the protagonist. Replete with neo-noir styling and a cast of top-notch character actors (including Joe Pantoliano, Carrie-Anne Moss, and Stephen Tobolowsky), \u201cMemento\u201d is a deliciously inventive mystery with a potent dose of melancholy right under its surface.  \u2014  Kitty Winn and Al Pacino in \u201cThe Panic in Needle Park.\u201d 20th Century Fox  \u2018The Panic in Needle Park\u2019  Leaving Netflix: March 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Before \u201cSerpico,\u201d before \u201cDog Day Afternoon,\u201d before even \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d Al Pacino made his big-screen breakthrough in this 1971 drug drama from director Jerry Schatzberg (\u201cStreet Smart\u201d). As a heroin addict and street hustler whose nights and days are an endless search for money, drugs or both, Pacino is both scarily convincing and offhandedly charismatic; you get a sense of why his new girlfriend, Helen (Kitty Winn, also terrific), would fall for him, and also why she should stay far away. Joan Didion and John Gregory Dunne\u2019s low-to-the-ground script and Schatzberg\u2019s gritty, neorealist-inspired photography create scenes that feel less written and staged than overheard and captured, resulting in an uncomfortable but powerful viewing experience.  \u2014  Natasha Lyonne in \u201cSlums of Beverly Hills.\u201d Fox Searchlight Pictures  \u2018The Slums of Beverly Hills\u2019  Leaving Netflix: March 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  American comedies don\u2019t deal in matters of class nearly as much as they could (and should), which is part of what makes this 1998 comedy from the writer-director Tamara Jenkins (\u201cThe Savages\u201d) unique, and valuable. Set in 1976, it concerns a lower-income family\u2019s attempts to keep the kids in good schools by dwelling in sketchy apartments right on the edge of Beverly Hills. Alan Arkin is a marvel as the hyper-neurotic patriarch, and David Krumholtz is uproariously funny as the unreasonably confident older son. But the showcase performer is Natasha Lyonne, warm and winning as the teenager daughter in the midst of a poorly-timed sexual awakening.  \u2014  0  A scene from \u201cThe Craft.\u201d Columbia Pictures  \u2018The Craft\u2019  Leaving Netflix: March 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Misfits and weirdos will love this 1996 supernatural thriller-drama, in which a nervous new girl (Robin Tunney) at a Catholic boarding school turns to a trio of outcasts (Neve Campbell, Fairuza Balk and Rachel True) for friendship, and their tight-knit group turns into a witches\u2019 coven. The witty script (by Peter Filardi and director Andrew Fleming) nicely quenches one\u2019s thirst for teenage vengeance, with all the proper parties getting their deserved comeuppance. But it\u2019s not just a gimmick movie; all four protagonists create distinctive characters of genuine depth, lending weight to what could have been a throwaway genre exercise.  \u2014  Eva Mendes and Will Smith in \u201cHitch.\u201d Columbia Pictures  \u2018Hitch\u2019  Leaving Netflix: March 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Between \u201cIndependence Day,\u201d \u201cMen in Black\u201d and \u201cI Am Legend,\u201d Will Smith got so good at saving the world, he rarely got the chance to flex his considerable romantic charm. This 2005 hit filled that niche a bit, casting Smith as a relationship expert and one-on-one date coach whose latest client (a sweet and likable Kevin James) is something of a challenge \u2014 one that arrives just as he meets (and finds himself atypically tongue-tied around) the woman of his own dreams (Eva Mendes). Director Andy Tennant mines plenty of laughs from Smith\u2019s built-in swagger and James\u2019s customary oafishness, and he also has a great time turning those personas inside out. Smith and Mendes generate real chemistry, provoking a genuine rooting interest in the midst of this lightweight romp.  \u2014  Marlon Brando in \u201cThe Chase.\u201d Horizon Pictures  \u2018The Chase\u2019  Leaving Netflix: March 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  A knockout ensemble cast \u2014 including Marlon Brando, Jane Fonda, Robert Redford, Robert Duvall and Angie Dickinson \u2014 assembles for this swampy, boozy, atmospheric thriller, in which a small town is rocked by a prison escape that unlocks their secret affairs, desires and lesser instincts. The pacing is a little punchy and the proceedings are a tad overheated, but it\u2019s worth a watch for the skill of the performers (Brando is particularly strong as a sheriff who\u2019s rapidly approaching the end of his rope) and for the inventive direction of Arthur Penn, whom we see tinkering with some of the thematic and stylistic interests he harvested to greater effect for his next film, \u201cBonnie and Clyde.\u201d  \u2014  Mireille Enos and Joel Kinnaman, right, in \u201cThe Killing.\u201d Chris Large/AMC  \u2018The Killing\u2019 (Seasons 1-2)  Leaving Netflix: March 13  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Normally, the removal of the first two seasons of a mystery serial would be a real bummer. But this four-season crime drama is something of an exception, as the split between Season 2 and Season 3 signaled the end of one story (and the end of an era, changing out all but two of the key cast members, which happened again for the fourth) and the beginning of the next. The first two years of the series, based on the Danish crime show \u201cForbrydelsen,\u201d tell a story about the murder of a Seattle teen in meticulous detail \u2014 each episode covers just 24 hours of the investigation. Taut and disturbing, intricate and moody, \u201cThe Killing\u201d is the kind of meaty crime drama that sticks to your ribs.  \u2014  Clockwise from top left: Cyril Figgis, Krieger, Cheryl, Pam Poovey, Sterling Archer and Ray Gillette in \u201cArcher.\u201d FX  \u2018Archer\u2019 (Seasons 1-7)  Leaving Netflix: March 14  : March 14 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  When it began in 2009, this animated FX comedy from Adam Reed sounded like a one-joke premise, and not exactly a fresh one either: an extended spoof on James Bond-style spy stories, set at a secret intelligence agency during an indeterminate and anachronistic pseudo-Cold War period. And yet it took flight (eight seasons and counting) thanks to the show\u2019s frisky writing, winking self-awareness, willingness to reboot itself entirely (full seasons have reset the narrative as a \u201cMiami Vice\u201d spoof and a private eye yarn), and most of all, the skills of the uproarious voice cast, including the \u201cArrested Development\u201d star Jessica Walters as another unstable mother and the \u201cBob\u2019s Burgers\u201d gem H. Jon Benjamin as the boozing, womanizing title character.  \u2014  From left, Judy Hopps (voiced by Ms. Goodwin) and Nick Wilde (voiced by Jason Bateman) in \u201cZootopia.\u201d Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures  \u2018Zootopia\u2019  Leaving Netflix: March 20  : March 20 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  On the surface, there shouldn\u2019t be anything particularly revelatory about a Disney movie with cuddly talking animals. What\u2019s fresh and fascinating about this 2016 smash Byron Howard and Rich Moore, however, is the way it takes the conventions of those movies and injects them with a subtle dose of social commentary \u2014 without turning preachy or detracting from its surface pleasures. Ginnifer Goodwin is plucky and charming as Judy Hopps, a bunny cop in a utopian city who is drawn into a mysterious case wherein tame animals are reverting to their wilder instincts. Jason Bateman is a marvelous counterpoint as the con-artist fox who leads her into the city\u2019s criminal underworld, creating a buddy cop dynamic that recalls \u201c48 HRS.\u201d as much as \u201cBambi.\u201d  \u2014  From left, Roger Rabbit (voiced by Charles Fleischer) and Bob Hoskins in \u201cWho Framed Roger Rabbit.\u201d Walt Disney Studios  \u2018Who Framed Roger Rabbit\u2019  Leaving Netflix: March 24  : March 24 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  \u201cZootopia\u201d wasn\u2019t Disney\u2019s first tale about crime-solving anthropomorphic mammals in the big city. One of its biggest hits of the 1980s was this clever story about cartoon animals and cynical humans who exist together in 1940s Los Angeles, where the movie star Roger Rabbit is accused of murdering a local tycoon. He hires Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins), a hard-boiled private eye, to clear his name, and they embark on a hilarious investigation of the animated movie industry, with cameo appearances by iconic characters from not only the Disney stable but also those of Warner Brothers, Max Fleischer and Walter Lantz. It\u2019s a treat for movie buffs and cartoon aficionados. It\u2019s also an entertaining potboiler, dipping into the juicy, \u201cChinatown\u201d-like mysteries and scandals of postwar Hollywood.  \u2014  From left: Waris Ahluwalia, Michael Gambon, Anjelica Huston, Noah Taylor, Bud Cort, Bill Murray, Matthew Gray Gubler, Seu Jorge, Jeff Goldblum, Cate Blanchett, Willem DaFoe in \u201cThe Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou.\u201d Phlippe Antonello/Touchstone Pictures  0  \u2018The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou\u2019  Leaving Netflix: March 26  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Bill Murray stars as Steve Zissou, a Jacques Cousteau-style oceanographer and documentarian, in this frisky yet bittersweet comic drama from director Wes Anderson. Working for the first time with Noah Baumbach (\u201cThe Squid and the Whale,\u201d \u201cFrances Ha\u201d) as his co-writer, Anderson indulges in an absurdist streak that meshes nicely with the familial discord and dry wit of his previous pictures. He also marshals one of his most impressive casts to date, which includes Cate Blanchett, Willem Dafoe, Michael Gambon, Jeff Goldblum, Anjelica Huston and Owen Wilson, who is both touching and goofy as Zissou\u2019s estranged son.  \u2014  Interested in getting suggestions on what to watch?

Photo  Ted Sarandos, the chief content officer at Netflix, laid down the gauntlet five years ago when he said, \u201cThe goal is to become HBO faster than HBO can become us.\u201d  That statement seemed unlikely, coming from an executive who had only recently begun overseeing original programming at a company better known for tucking DVDs into postage-paid red envelopes.  Jump-cut to the present: Netflix is valued at some $115 billion and has 110.6 million subscribers worldwide. It has shown off its might by signing David Letterman to a deal at reportedly $2 million an episode for his new talk show series, giving Chris Rock a reported $40 million for two standup specials and handing Jerry Seinfeld a reported $100 million for his interview program, \u201cComedians in Cars Drinking Coffee,\u201d and standup shows.  Dana Walden, a co-chief executive of the Fox television group, said Mr. Sarandos\u2019s signing of Ms. Rhimes was the deal that had evinced a deep change in Hollywood.  \u201cWhat Ted did was extremely disruptive and sent a message to the entire talent community: These old deals that seemed incredibly lucrative at the time, there\u2019s a new template in town,\u201d Ms. Walden said. \u201cFor any uber-premium creator, the value has gone up 10 times. And Ryan is a once-in-a-lifetime creator.\u201d  Rick Rosen, the head of TV at the agency WME, said it had become clear that Netflix was now able to outspend the companies that had been around since the early days of the movie business.  Photo  \u201cAs a representative of talent, if you have top-top talent, you must talk to them,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019d be negligent if you didn\u2019t. Top talent wants to pitch to Netflix.\u201d  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Another competitor in the expanding streaming industry, Hulu \u2014 which is available only in the United States \u2014 has gained momentum recently with original series like the much-decorated \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d and now has 17 million subscribers. While that is no match for Netflix, the company has seen growth in each of the last two quarters.  Apple is the wild card. The company has been buying projects at breakneck speed as it begins to shell out more than $1 billion on original programming. And as Amazon moves into the internationally friendly fantasy genre with \u201cThe Lord of the Rings,\u201d it has equipped itself with fresh leadership in the person of the respected NBC executive Jennifer Salke. (Earlier this month, she replaced Roy Price, who resigned as the head of Amazon Studios in October after he was accused of sexual harassment.)

With the old Hollywood model disrupted, or perhaps broken, Disney, Fox, CBS, Viacom and Time Warner have moved to gain scale in their efforts to compete against the deep-pocketed upstarts.  Pending governmental approval, Disney will acquire much of 21st Century Fox in a $52.4 billion deal that the two companies reached in December. CBS and Viacom, which were part of the same corporation from 2000 to 2006, are in talks to reunite. And AT&T is working to purchase Time Warner \u2014 a deal that is in jeopardy because of a lawsuit filed by the Justice Department to block it on antitrust grounds.  The mergers and acquisitions taking place in the background are, for now, a destabilizing force in the entertainment industry \u2014 one that likely contributed to Mr. Murphy\u2019s decision to leave old Hollywood for the streaming space.  Photo  \u201cWere the Disney deal to have never happened, I think he would have been close to a new deal with us,\u201d said Ms. Walden, the Fox executive who has worked closely with Mr. Murphy. \u201cIf the Disney move happened a year ago, and the transaction was completed by now and we were part of the Disney Company, I think he would be part of us.\u201d  Mr. Murphy declined to comment for this article.  Disney \u2014 a part-owner of Hulu that is building new streaming services under its chief executive, Robert A. Iger \u2014 has repeatedly cited 21st Century Fox\u2019s ability to create popular programming as one of the main reasons it sought to acquire it from Rupert Murdoch. Disney\u2019s own television studio has not been a reliable supplier.  The day after losing Mr. Murphy to Netflix, John Landgraf, the chief executive of FX, which is part of 21st Century Fox, pointed to his cable network\u2019s long record of producing talent, including Donald Glover (\u201cAtlanta\u201d) and Pamela Adlon (\u201cBetter Things\u201d).  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  \u201cWith more than 20 scripted original series on our schedule or upcoming, FX has a very successful track record of identifying and developing talented writers who have produced award-winning hit shows, and it will continue to do so,\u201d he said.  The money aside, Mr. Murphy may have decided that he had a better chance of creating new shows with minimal interference from above at Netflix, rather than at a Disneyfied version of 21st Century Fox. Referring to Disney\u2019s agreement to acquire much of the company at a news media event last month, the producer said: \u201cWhen this deal first went down, I got a call from the Murdochs and I got a call from Mr. Iger. And I said point-blank, you know, the stuff that I do is not specifically Disney, and I\u2019m interested in that and I\u2019m concerned about that.\u201d  The Murphy deal is a distillation of what may prove to be a once-in-a-generation Hollywood moment. He was looking for security at a time when the old-line companies had yet to take the expanded form they are likely to assume in the next year \u2014 and when the streaming services are spending in manic style.  And it helps that Mr. Murphy has become a Netflix obsessive in his own right.  \u201cAll Ryan has watched for the last year has been Netflix,\u201d said Ms. Walden, who is the godmother to Mr. Murphy\u2019s children. \u201cHe loves their Y.A. series, he loves their documentaries, he watched \u2018The OA\u2019 and loved it, he loved \u201813 Reasons Why,\u2019 he admires the brand, the programming. It was the right timing and right company for him.\u201d  The question now is: How long will the streaming companies continue to spend in a George Streinbrenner-like fashion for talent? Last month, Netflix told investors that it had generated a net income of more than $559 million in 2017, but said its free cash flow was negative $2 billion \u2014 a figure that could balloon to $4 billion this year, the company said.", "stock": "NFLX", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-15", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/14/business/media/streaming-wars-ryan-murphy.html"}, {"article": "\u201cIt\u2019s such a beautiful thing that you don\u2019t have to waste,\u201d he said of the oft-discarded end of the cheese block.

Any queer loves a grilled cheese, but it\u2019s not a revelation to cut it into four triangular pieces.\u201d  Mr. Porowski, 33, said that he tries his best to ignore the noise, but admitted that it hurts to hear, not least because he knows that an act as elementary as cutting open a fruit can be eye-opening for some people.  \u201cTom Jackson never saw the inside of an avocado before,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had all these other components that we made for that food demo that I wanted to show him how to make if we had a chance to. But when I cut open that avocado, he looked over in this childlike wonder and was actually amazed.\u201d  He lamented that negativity was a natural response to a program that elevates ordinary people to \u201chero\u201d status. \u201cI think that\u2019s why the show is doing so well,\u201d he said, noting that \u201cQueer Eye\u201d is available to stream in 190 countries. \u201cIt\u2019s about kindness, and we haven\u2019t seen that in a really long time.\u201d  Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Of the Moment The lifestyle newsletter from the Styles, Travel and Food sections, offering the latest trends to news you can use.

Netflix threatens to move the movie business onto our television screens and laptops. Film attendance in the United States is at its lowest level in 23 years. Only the occasional superhero makes real money.  But don\u2019t tell that to the intrepid programmers of New York, who somehow keep the city\u2019s multiplexes, art houses, archives, film societies and cultural centers awash in festivals and specialty series. Fighting the twin tides of online streaming and comic-book blockbusters, they\u2019re the real heart of the New York moviegoing experience. As a snapshot of their efforts, we\u2019re highlighting one film from each of nine festivals or series taking place in the city this month alone.  Havana Film Festival New York, \u201cIndestructible: The Soul of Salsa\u201d  The Spanish flamenco singer Diego el Cigala, known for blending European and Afro-Cuban traditions, travels to Havana; San Juan, P.R.; Miami; New York; and Cali, Colombia, to talk about the past and (shaky) present of salsa, perform with collaborators like Gonzalo Rubalcaba and the Fania All-Stars, and perhaps snare some of the \u201cBuena Vista Social Club\u201d audience. Typical of its genre, this celebratory documentary balances infomercial tendencies with potent nostalgia and infectious music. April 11 and 13, AMC Loews 34th Street.

This 1963 Czech rarity, based on a novel by (who else) Stanislaw Lem, presents space travel as a contemplative affair punctuated by swinging cocktail dances.

Tom Hanks in \u201cApollo 13.\u201d Universal Pictures  \u2018Apollo 13\u2019  Leaving Netflix: April 1  April 1 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  There\u2019s no greater testament to the skill and craft of this 1995 smash from Ron Howard than the fact that he manages to build (and sustain, for two-plus hours) tension and suspense around an event with a widely known outcome. That event is the Apollo 13 lunar mission in 1970, intended to be the third manned landing on the moon but aborted after a mechanical failure that put the lives of its three astronauts in jeopardy. Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon and Bill Paxton project credible professionalism in those roles, finding the proper, fleeting moments to let their understandable fear and frustration blast through; an Oscar-nominated Ed Harris is brilliant as the flight director on the ground, marshaling the minds tasked with bringing their boys home.  \u2014  Michael Keaton, left, and Jack Nicholson in \u201cBatman.\u201d Warner Bros., via Everett Collection  \u2018Batman\u2019 / \u2018Batman Returns\u2019  Leaving Netflix: April 1  Once upon a time, a big-budget, big-screen adaptation of a popular comic book was actually a big deal. But the attraction to Tim Burton\u2019s 1989 \u201cBatman\u201d wasn\u2019t just its subject, but its style: The Gothically-inclined Burton (\u201cBatman\u201d was released between \u201cBeetlejuice\u201d and \u201cEdward Scissorhands\u201d) followed the lead of the graphic novels by Frank Miller, eschewing the fizzy, cartoon-pop sensibility of the \u201960s television series (and its film spinoff) and crafting a decidedly darker take on the Dark Knight, casting Michael Keaton against type in the title role opposite a riveting (and scenery-chewing) Jack Nicholson as the Joker. It was so successful, Burton was given more even freedom on its 1992 follow-up, which takes Gotham into grimmer territory thanks to Danny DeVito\u2019s freakish take on the Penguin and Michelle Pfeiffer\u2019s sizzling turn as Catwoman.  \u2014  A scene from \u201cCaddyshack.\u201d Warner Bros.  \u2018Caddyshack\u2019  Leaving Netflix: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  One of the most quotable comedies of the modern era (\u201cCinderella story,\u201d \u201cBe the ball,\u201d \u201cSo I got that goin\u2019 for me, which is nice\u201d), this 1980 favorite from director Harold Ramis (\u201cGroundhog Day\u201d) often feels like channel surfing between several movies at once: a W.C. Fields-style personality comedy starring Rodney Dangerfield; a wiseguy, post-\u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 vehicle for Chevy Chase; a slapstick farce starring Bill Murray; and an earnest coming-of-age comedy-drama featuring Michael O\u2019Keefe. But the inconsistency and incongruity somehow mesh, due in part to the picture\u2019s spirit of cheerful, slobs-vs.-snobs anarchy, resulting in something akin to a coked-up Marx Brothers movie.  \u2014  A scene from \u201cCool Runnings.\u201d Buena Vista Pictures  \u2018Cool Runnings\u2019  Leaving Netflix: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  One of the highlights of the 1988 Winter Olympics (from a storytelling perspective, if not a sporting one) was the debut of the Jamaican national bobsled team, which quickly became a fan favorite for their clear discomfort with an event not exactly common to their tropical home. But it soon became a feel-good underdog story of teamwork in the face of adversity \u2014 in other words, ideal fodder for a big-screen dramatization by Disney. And what could have been a one-joke physical comedy play instead became a warmhearted \u201990s classic, thanks to the energetic direction by Jon Turteltaub (\u201cNational Treasure\u201d) and the charismatic turns by Doug E. Doug, Leon, Malik Yoba, and Rawle D. Lewis as the team members, and (in one of his final performances) the great John Candy as their coach.  \u2014  0  John Mulaney on \u201cJohn Mulaney: New in Town.\u201d Comedy Central  \u2018John Mulaney: New in Town\u2019  Leaving Netflix: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  This 2012 special from John Mulaney, the former \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d writer and stand-up comic extraordinaire, which originally aired on Comedy Central, was only his second such showcase, but he already showed an old-timer\u2019s mastery of the form. His deceptively simple persona, of a meek but good-hearted soul doing his very best to navigate a complicated world, proves durable and reliable as he explores dating, doctor\u2019s visits and basic social interactions. The show\u2019s funniest (if somewhat specialized) bit, however, may be his lengthy rumination on the pleasures of \u201cLaw & Order: Special Victims Unit\u201d and its resident skeptic, Ice-T.  \u2014  Alex Bailey/Fox Searchlight Pictures  \u2018Never Let Me Go\u2019  Leaving Netflix: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Kazuo Ishiguro\u2019s 2005 dystopian romance novel gets the big-screen treatment in this 2010 drama from director Mark Romanek (\u201cOne Hour Photo\u201d). Keira Knightley, Carey Mulligan and Andrew Garfield star as three students and occasional romantic partners who discover, in their teens, that all of them are clones \u2014 born and raised for the eventual harvesting of their organs. Screenwriter Alex Garland displays the thoughtful, chamber-music approach to science fiction of his subsequent \u201cEx Machina\u201d and \u201cAnnihilation\u201d (both of which he directed). Romanek, meanwhile, pulls off the neat trick of creating a cold, sterile world that is nonetheless infected by warmth and humanity \u2014 attributable in no small part to the skillful work of his crackerjack cast.  \u2014  Morgan Freeman in \u201cThe Shawshank Redemption.\u201d Columbia Pictures, via Everett Collection  \u2018The Shawshank Redemption\u2019  Leaving Netflix: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Removing this 1994 prison drama from Netflix probably won\u2019t dent its ubiquity \u2014 it\u2019s a regular topper of IMDb\u2019s Top 250 list and it seems to pop up on TNT or TBS on a near-weekly basis. But it still smarts not to have this cinematic comfort food a mouse-click away, as it features the quintessential Morgan Freeman performance (wise, calm, and narrating for clarity) and some of Tim Robbins\u2019 most complicated work (as a man who says little and reveals even less). Frank Darabont\u2019s patient filmmaking, in which a series of seemingly casual vignettes crescendo into an emotionally overwhelming climax, makes this a particularly re-watchable film, in which little throwaways and asides take on extra meaning upon second (and third, and tenth) viewings.  \u2014  David Bowie in \u201cThe Prestige.\u201d Touchstone Pictures  \u2018The Prestige\u2019  Leaving Netflix: April 21  April 21 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Between his first and second cracks at Batman, director Christopher Nolan slid in this twisty, stylish exercise in sleight-of-hand moviemaking, as if to assure the fans of his breakthrough movie \u201cMemento\u201d that he was still up to his old tricks. This time around, the term \u201ctricks\u201d is literal: In \u201cThe Prestige,\u201d Nolan tells the story of two stage magicians in 1890s London, whose friendly rivalry first becomes fraught, then deadly. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale scheme and connive appropriately in the leading roles; a standout supporting cast includes Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall and David Bowie.  \u2014  Banksy in a scene from \u201cExit Through the Gift Shop.\u201d Paranoid Pictures  \u2018Exit Through the Gift Shop\u2019  Leaving Netflix: April 22  April 22 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  The enigmatic and eccentric street artist Banksy directs this Oscar-nominated 2010 documentary, in which he profiles the rise of Thierry Guetta, known by the street-art name \u201cMister Brainwash.\u201d Frisky and funny, it casts a cynical insider\u2019s eye on the art world, as well as on Banksy\u2019s place inside it \u2014 particularly in retrospect because of rumors that Guetta was, in fact, a creation of Banksy\u2019s and that the entire story is a made-up prank. The director (who never reveals his face in the film) has denied the rumors, but they lend an extra dimension to this film, in which everything (and perhaps everyone) could be a bluff.  \u2014  Mark Ruffalo and Keira Knightley in \u201cBegin Again.\u201d Andrew Schwartz/Weinstein Company  \u2018Begin Again\u2019  Leaving Netflix: April 27  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  The Irish writer and director John Carney revisited his microbudget, Oscar-winning indie sensation \u201cOnce\u201d with a well-financed, star-cast exploration of the same themes: the magnificence of pop music, the semi-romantic charge of collaboration and the power of a song to say what can\u2019t be put into words alone. Keira Knightley is charming (and believable) as a songwriter who finds an unexpected champion in a burned-out record executive (Mark Ruffalo). The musical numbers are stirring, and the dramatic beats land, but its best scene is its simplest: its two protagonists, wandering through New York City with their headphones, playing each other their favorite songs. Sweet but not saccharine, it is full of tiny moments of truth.  \u2014", "stock": "NFLX", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-22", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/22/watching/leaving-netflix-movies-april.html"}, {"article": "Photo  The plan to have every episode of the second season of Marvel and Netflix\u2019s \u201cJessica Jones\u201d directed by women was conceived a year before the Harvey Weinstein revelations. But now that season arrives like a presciently timed herald of the #MeToo-Time\u2019s Up revolution, with 13 female directors and 9 of 13 episodes written or co-written by women. For added emphasis, it begins streaming on Thursday, which is International Women\u2019s Day.  This concentration of female creators is unusual, of course, particularly for a high-profile, comic-book-based drama. But \u201cJessica Jones\u201d was already one of the more women-centric dramas around when its first season appeared more than two years ago.  Its creator and showrunner, Melissa Rosenberg of the \u201cTwilight\u201d movies, focused tightly on Jones (Krysten Ritter), a moody private eye who had super strength forced on her as a child, and a few other female characters: Trish Walker (Rachael Taylor), a talk-radio host who is Jones\u2019s only friend, and Jeri Hogarth (Carrie-Anne Moss), a ruthless lawyer who helps Jones when it aligns with her own agenda.  In the first five episodes of Season 2 (an atypically small number for Netflix to provide for review), that triumvirate is even more central to the plot. And their portrayals have taken on new shades. Already isolated \u2014 none has children or a spouse \u2014 they are defined even more than before by their pain and rage and their desperate efforts to assert control over their lives. Jones is an emotional cripple unable to confront her past; Hogarth\u2019s monomaniacal focus on her career leaves her unprepared to face mortality. The relatively well-adjusted Walker is an abuse victim and recovering addict who can\u2019t commit to a relationship.

We\u2019ve seen a powerful person\u2019s downward spiral play out in a room with multiple hookers, cocaine and embarrassing dancing, but that person usually isn\u2019t a woman. We\u2019ve seen protagonists whose bottled-up anger turns them sullen, violent and heedless of others, but they\u2019re usually men. We\u2019ve seen the heroes of mystery-thrillers worry about their investigations putting loved ones in danger, but heroines not so much. (Conversely, traditional roles are preserved in a plot element involving Walker\u2019s past as a child star that explicitly invokes #MeToo.)

But a clich\u00e9 is still a clich\u00e9, whether it\u2019s presented from a female or male point of view. And the early episodes of the season make a lot of room for fairly static character development, with proportionally less attention paid to the traditional genre pleasures, like atmosphere and action, which were central to the first season\u2019s invigorating noir-superhero synthesis. (The noir part of the equation is still present, but dimly, in Jones\u2019s occasional voice-overs and in a preponderance of detective work that\u2019s pretty basic and arbitrary, a step or two above Googling when it isn\u2019t simply Googling.)", "stock": "NFLX", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-07", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/07/arts/television/marvel-jessica-jones-review-netflix.html"}, {"article": "Netflix is without a doubt the best streaming service in Australia. It's affordable and works flawlessly. It's easy to see why Netflix is the gold standard in streaming.  Streaming has taken off in a big way in Australia since the launch of Netflix and Stan in 2015, changing the way that Aussies approach entertainment consumption, while also paving the way for the likes of Foxtel Now.  If you're having trouble deciding on which streaming service to choose, we're here to make that decision as easy as possible for you.  Netflix has evolved quite a bit since its launch, having added more functionality and content to keep up with customer demands and the constant innovation seen in the smart TV market.  While all of the SVOD services in Australia have terrific content on offer, Netflix remains the undisputed king of streaming. Read our in depth review to find out why!  Cheapest stream around  Netflix Australia starts from $9.99 per month for the entry-level, single-stream standard definition package, all the way up to $17.99 for the deluxe, 4K quality, four-stream package.  While not everyone is going to be able to take advantage of 4K streaming quality, either due to the resolution capabilities of their TV set, or the bandwidth quality that's available to them, the package is unquestionably great value.  If you're worried about the kind of stream quality you're going to get from the service, never fear: you can try Netflix out with an obligation-free 30 day trial period.  While we can't really recommend the standard definition package to anyone who can help it, it is a nice option for those with poor-quality internet connections.  Most people will want to opt for the middle range package, giving customers access to two simultaneous streams of 1080p content for $13.99 a month.  Please note, If you plan to stream Netflix on an Xbox 360 or Xbox One, you'll need to have an Xbox Live account. That isn't a Netflix thing; it's a Microsoft thing, and it applies to Netflix's rivals, too.  There's also an added bonus for Optus and iiNet customers \u2013 Netflix usage is completely unmetered for those internet service providers.  Compatible devices  Though its competitors are slowly improving in terms of device compatibility, Netflix remains king, playable on just about everything.  Like Stan and Presto, Netflix can be viewed with the use of a Google Chromecast, Apple TV, iOS device, Android device, PC, Sony' PS4 and PS3 consoles, and a range of Smart TVs. Unlike those services, you can also watch Netflix on Microsoft's Xbox 360 and Xbox One, Nintendo's Wii U. It can also be watched on a range of set-top boxes and media players like Roku player and Fetch TV.  Though Netflix was previously viewable on WD TV Live media player devices, that functionality has since been patched out, with Western Digital choosing to focus on what it's good at \u2013 streaming content from your computer to your TV.  Speaking of Roku, Netflix is now also available on the Roku 2-powered Telstra TV streaming box, which. along with the PlayStation 3 and 4, can provide access to all three of Australia's major SVOD services.  It should be noted that not all devices can stream Netflix in 4K. This functionality depends on your 4K smart TV has an in-built Netflix app, or if you've got 4K-ready device, like the Xbox One S or Xbox One X, the PS4 Pro, an Ultra HD Blu-ray player, or the Fetch TV Mighty.  Netflix also offers some of its content in HDR and Dolby Vision, depending on your television supports the high dynamic range formats.  Setting up Netflix  Getting Netflix up and running is remarkably straightforward, and should be easy enough for even your tech-illiterate mum and dad to set up without any problems \u2013 simply create an account and use your login details to sign in to any of the devices listed above.  The signup process involves the usual entering of your details, moving on to choosing one of the three packages Netflix offers.  Because Netflix prides itself on its recommendation algorithm, you will be asked to pick three shows or films that you'd like to watch or know that you enjoy from a range of options.  Choose carefully, because these choices will form the foundation of your Netflix recommendations experiences for the foreseeable future.  While Netflix will continually tailor its recommendations for you based on what you actually watch, your initial choices will still be used to recommend you stuff years later.  Once you've created a profile, you can start adding shows and films to your Netflix 'My List'.  You can make multiple profiles, of course, so everyone in your household can get a personalised set of recommendations and keep their own queue of shows.  There's even a ready-made profile exclusively for kids, with all the inappropriate stuff filtered out.  The Netflix user experience  Those who've used an overseas Netflix service before can rest assured that Netflix Australia's interface is completely identical (aside from its content selection).  Those who are using Netflix for the first time shouldn't have any trouble navigating its user-friendly interface, which separates Netflix's content into a number of different genres and categories that you can swipe through to see what's on offer.  The shows and movies you've watched most recently are at the top of your Netflix screen, allowing you to jump right back in and continue watching, and following right after is the 'My List' category, giving you easy access to all of the shows you've queued up for later perusal.  From here, you'll get categories that show you what's currently popular on Netflix, the service's 'Top Picks' for you, which are based on 'thumbs up/thumbs down' ratings handed out by people with similar viewing habits to you. Eventually, genres and recommendations become more specific to your interests as you continue to watch different kinds of programmes and movies.  Admittedly, it can be annoying to have to scroll through several layers of categories to get to the sections you actually want to browse.  Rather than show you everything the service has on its front page, Netflix would rather maintain a level or mystery surrounding the size of its library, opting instead to give you a taste of what it has, and then keep springing new suggestions on you based on what you watch. If you do want to see everything the service has to offer, you'll need to visit each individual genre separately and scroll through its offerings.  Thankfully, it's been revealed that you can now unlock a huge number of oddly specific categories on the web version of Netflix by adding a numerical code to the end of a certain URL. The trick gives you access to such genres as 'Understated Movies based on real life' and 'Gory Italian Movies from the 1980s.  The constantly shifting nature of Netflix's suggestions gives the service the illusion of having more content than it actually does \u2013 it's like this in every territory.  Hop into a programme and either choose a specific episode from a specific season or continue from where you were last at \u2013 Netflix will always remember your spot.  Unlike Stan, Netflix gives you subtitle options on pretty much every single show in its range, as well as different language tracks where available \u2013 this is a huge win for the hearing impaired and those with a language barrier.  When it comes to actually watching content however, Netflix completely outclasses its competitors.  Even on a moderate broadband connection, our streams began almost immediately after hitting the play button \u2013 we only ever experienced two or three seconds of loading before the start of a show, and within ten seconds of it starting, Netflix's variable bit rate had already cleared the image up into a pristine, high-definition presentation.  That variable bit rate is the truly what makes Netflix so special, allowing the quality of your stream to seamlessly go up and down depending on your connection, rather than stopping your show dead in its tracks in order to buffer.  While watching Netflix through a VPN and Smart DNS has always been a fast and smooth experience, local Netflix feels even faster and smoother.  Best of all, Netflix has finally introduced offline viewing, meaning that users can now download certain TV shows and films to their iOS and Android apps. On top of this, it is now possible to use Netflix's offline viewing functionality in the Windows 10 PC app. It's worth noting that this will only work within the app \u2013 offline viewing is not available through your PC's browser.  This changes absolutely everything when it comes to enjoying Netflix, as subscribers can now use the app outside of Wi-Fi networks without worrying about data consumption.  To download shows and films, you must first have the latest version of the Netflix app. Once you've got that, tap on the drop down menu and head to the new section, Available for Download.  Here, you'll find a selection of shows and movies that content holders have deemed acceptable to download. Not everything is available yet, but there is a decent selection to choose from. You can also head to your app settings to choose whether you want to download shows in SD or HD \u2013 the choice will really come down to how much space you have on your smart device.", "stock": "NFLX", "label": 1, "date": "2018-01-24", "source": "techradar", "url": "http://www.techradar.com/reviews/audio-visual/av-accessories/netflix-1289024/review"}, {"article": "Very soon OSN customers will be able to access Netflix\u2019s content library via a new OSN Box that will be launched towards the end of the second quarter.

The first Cloverfield came out of nowhere with very little fanfare or pre-release information, eventually revealing itself to be a Godzilla-style monster movie.  Years later, the next film in the sci-fi anthology series, 13 Cloverfield Lane, was announced only two months prior to its theatrical release, refreshingly giving filmgoers a respite from the endless lead-up and hype that usually precedes the release of most blockbuster movies.

The move, which Sky is calling a \"major development\", will allow the broadcaster to cut its costs while also offering more affordable and convenient packages to customers.

If so, then you might want to give Tubi a shot \u2013 like Sony's Crackle , it's a totally free, ad-supported streaming video service that you can access on loads of devices.  Tubi (a.k.a. Tubi TV) is stocked with an array of licensed movies and television shows from across the years, and much like Crackle, the selection is decidedly hit-or-miss. But Tubi really does have a lot of compelling movies on offer, and there's no premium element in play: you'll never have to reach for a credit card. There's no original content and little in the way of recent releases, but the selection is large and seems to be updated on a regular basis.  Ready to give it a shot? Here's how to drop the monthly fee and get started with Tubi TV.  How much does Tubi cost?  Truly, it's nothing: you won't hit a paywall at any point, nor can you toss in a credit card to eliminate ads or access premium content or perks. Tubi is 100% ad-supported, which means you'll see commercials before and also during content.  Luckily, the ads are usually pretty short and innocuous, and pop up inconsistently within and around the content. When watching an episode of a TV show, you'll probably see a short (30-second) commercial beforehand, and maybe a 15-second or 30-second ad in the middle. It varies, though: We watched Cowboy Bebop and didn't see any ads beforehand, but then it had two commercials for a total of 45 seconds at the middle point.  With movies, we've encountered different results, as well. A viewing of Arnold Schwarzenegger's The Running Man via the PlayStation 4 app began with a single short ad, but then continued uninterrupted for the next 45 minutes or so. There would also be an ad any time that I resumed the film after stopping, though.  On the other hand, Oldboy on the iPad app began without an ad, but then it played one every 12-15 minutes over the course of the flick. That's a little awkward, since the ad break won't always come at an opportune pause in the action, but overall the ads seem less prevalent than with Crackle.  How can I access Tubi?  Luckily, Tubi is pretty much everywhere in terms of platforms and devices. You can watch it via the website on your computer or elsewhere, while native apps are available on smartphones and tablets, not to mention set-top boxes and game consoles.  You'll find iOS and Android apps, for example, as well as apps for Roku, Apple TV, and Amazon Fire TV boxes. The PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Xbox 360 have native Tubi apps, too, and they're all pretty easy to use and navigate through.  Tubi doesn't require a login to watch some videos on the service, but anything that's rated R or otherwise has a Mature designation will require a free account. There's other value to using an account, however, such as queuing up interesting movies and shows, getting smart recommendations based on your viewing habits, and resuming something you started on any device.  What are Tubi's key features?  As mentioned before, Tubi is totally free and accessible from nearly any modern device you're likely to wield \u2013 so it has both of those things going for it.  More importantly, Tubi has a lot of free content available \u2013 quite a bit more than Crackle, based on browsing the extensive listings. According to the company, Tubi has more than 50,000 titles in its library, with key partnerships with Lionsgate, Paramount, MGM, and Starz helping to keep its content coffers full.  Granted, you might not be compelled to watch everything on Tubi, and that's about more than just preference. Tubi has a fair amount of random junk filling up its listings, with straight-to-DVD movies and a lot of other generic-looking fare that you've never heard of before. It's not anywhere near as curated for quality as premium services tend to be, and you'll have to dig around to find the good stuff.  But it does have a lot of stuff, and there are some solid gems in the mix. In terms of feature films, the selection as of this writing includes picks like Young Adult, Oldboy, True Grit (2010), School of Rock, Mulholland Drive, and Glengarry Glen Ross.  Tubi doesn't have a lot of high-profile TV shows, unfortunately, unless you're into Alf ... and why wouldn't you be? It has some cult favorites, too, like The IT Crowd and Spaced, plus Tubi's anime selection is pretty stellar, with series like Cowboy Bebop, Naruto, and Revolutionary Girl Utena available as of this posting.  Tubi seems to add new movies and shows gradually throughout the month, as well, so it's worth checking back and having a browse from time to time.  Why choose Tubi over Netflix?  It's all about the money, really, or the lack thereof. Netflix's monthly subscription fee has gradually risen over the years, particularly as the company pours billions into original shows and movies, and you're paying for exclusive content and a strong selection of newish movies and TV shows from elsewhere.  Tubi TV offers no high-profile exclusives, and the vast majority of the noteworthy content is at least several years old at this point. But Tubi TV has a surprisingly large library on offer, and it's all completely free \u2013 with a totally reasonable amount of video ads along the way.  Not finding what you're looking for on Netflix? Have a look on Tubi: it won't cost you anything, and maybe you'll stumble upon an old favorite flick or something appealing that you haven't seen before. Tubi probably won't replace Netflix for the average paying customer, but if you're not keen on spending for streaming video, then it's a strong ad-supported alternative.  Watch these shows  The IT Crowd: The cult-favorite British show nearly came here in an Americanized version, but thank goodness it didn't. Luckily, you can watch the entire hilarious original series \u2013 about the goofballs running a company's IT department \u2013 for free on Tubi.  Cowboy Bebop: One of the most beloved anime series around, Cowboy Bebop follows a ragtag bunch of space bounty hunters. It has wonderful characters, brilliant animation and music, and a potent blend of action, drama, wry humor, and emotional punch.  Spaced: Do you like Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz? If so, then don't miss Spaced, another UK cult favorite from director Edgar Wright and star Simon Pegg. Like their flicks, this sitcom is endlessly quotable and packed with pop culture adoration.  Watch these movies  Battle Royale: Haven't seen the original Japanese film that inspired everything from The Hunger Games to PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds? Well, this tale of a class of students all trying to kill each other is delightfully ultra-violent, and it's free on Tubi.  True Grit: The Coen Brothers' 2010 remake of the classic Western was a critical smash, paying loving tribute to the genre with a star-studded cast featuring Jeff Bridges, Matt Damon, Josh Brolin, and a young Hailee Steinfeld.  Oldboy: Speaking of super-twisted Japanese flicks: Oldboy is an incredibly intense film about a man secretly imprisoned for 15 years, and then set loose to find and destroy his unknown captor. It's a revenge film that you won't soon forget, assuming you can stomach it all.", "stock": "NFLX", "label": -1, "date": "2018-01-17", "source": "techradar", "url": "http://www.techradar.com/news/tubi-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-free-movie-and-tv-streaming-service"}, {"article": "Netflix has supported Google Assistant for a while, but as it only started up the main user profile, the hands-free benefits of the voice assistant were somewhat limited if you lived in a busy household.

So without further ado, these are the best TV shows and movies coming soon to Netflix.", "stock": "NFLX", "label": 1, "date": "2018-01-23", "source": "techradar", "url": "http://www.techradar.com/news/the-best-upcoming-tv-shows-and-movies-on-netflix"}, {"article": "Late last week, celebrated filmmaker Steven Spielberg offered a somewhat controversial opinion regarding Netflix Original films in an interview with the UK's ITV, stating that \"once you commit to a television format you\u2019re a TV movie,\" before elaborating that good Netflix films \"deserve an Emmy, but not an Oscar.\u201d  Of course, the three-time Academy Award recipient's comments were driven by his feelings regarding the current state of the film industry, in which many smaller, more personal films are forgoing the traditional theatrical release route by going straight into living rooms, rather than competing with the mega-budget studio tentpole films that dominate the world's multiplexes.  While it's perhaps easy to sympathize with the mega-director's lamentations regarding the decline of the cinematic experience, it strikes us as somewhat elitist to suggest that a film's distribution method somehow makes it less worthy of praise because it didn't have a significant theatrical run.  It's not just Spielberg that feels this way \u2014 it's been announced that Netflix Originals will no longer be eligible to compete in the Cannes Film Festival. Netflix's films can still be shown at the festival, but they won't be up for the prestigious Palme d'Or. It's a huge blow for the streaming service, considering that its film Okja was nominated for that very same award last year.  So is the Ready Player One director right about the original films on Netflix and other streaming services? Or does 'The Beard' just need to get with the times and accept that cinema has changed?  Steven Spielberg and the Sundance bid  Coming so shortly after Netflix's first Academy Award win with its feature-length documentary Icarus, it comes as a bit of a slap in the face to filmmakers and producers who opted for the best distribution approach available to them. This is part of the problem, according to Spielberg.  \"I\u2019m just saying fewer and fewer filmmakers are going to struggle to raise money in order to compete in Sundance and possibly get one of the specialty labels to release their films theatrically, publicly.\"  However, looking at the history of Netflix Original films to date, it's clear that very few of those films deliberately set out to be released on a streaming service \u2014 most Netflix Originals are purchased by the streaming giant at film festivals long after they've been completed. Many of them were actually acquired at Sundance.  Last year, Netflix spent $12.5 million at the Utah-based film festival for the acquisition of Mudbound, a film that would go on to be nominated for four Academy Awards. This year, the streaming giant came away from the Sundance film festival with a number of films that will be released as Netflix Originals, including the hotly-anticipated Seeing Allred and White Fang.  Filmmakers are still taking their films to Sundance, but Netflix is the distributor that's willing to buy them.  It's not just smaller festival flicks that Netflix is interested in, either. While not exactly a hit with critics, the Will Smith-starring Netflix Original Bright had a production budget worthy of any blockbuster, costing upwards of $90 million \u2014 far from what you'd consider a TV-movie budget.  Though Spielberg recognised that \"television is thriving with quality and heart,\u201d he remained firm on his stance. \"I\u2019ll still make The Post and ask an audience to please go out to theaters and see The Post and not make it for Netflix,\" he said.  The film industry \"implosion\"  In 2013, Spielberg and fellow beard George Lucas predicted an \"implosion\" in the film industry, telling USC students that, \"There's going to be an implosion where three or four or maybe even a half-dozen mega-budget movies are going to go crashing into the ground, and that's going to change the paradigm.\"  That change they spoke of predicted a world in which trips to the theater would be a more costly, prestige event, and where smaller films would either be shown at a vastly-reduced ticket price or would have to find alternative distribution avenues. \"The pathway to get into theaters is really getting smaller and smaller,\" said Lucas.  In response to a comment offered by Lucas, Spielberg spoke specifically about how his Academy Award-winning film Lincoln was very nearly an HBO movie.  \"I think eventually the Lincolns will go away and they're going to be on television,\" said Lucas regarding his friend's most recent film at the time. \"As mine almost was,\" chimed-in Spielberg. \"This close \u2013 ask HBO \u2013 this close.\"  By that reasoning, would this mean that Daniel Day-Lewis' incredible performance as Abraham Lincoln would've been less worthy of the Oscar it earned because of the film's ultimate distribution method? Of course, an Emmy is basically the television equivalent of an Academy Award, and carries its own kind of esteem, but the Oscars undeniably carry more gravitas and prestige.  And if we really are heading towards a future where only tentpole blockbusters are released in theaters and smaller dramas and independent films are relegated to the small screen, does that mean only Marvel and Star Wars films will be deserving of Oscar's praise in 20 years?  Had 2016's Best Picture winner Moonlight been made five years from now, it probably wouldn't receive the same 1,100 theater-release it had a couple of years ago by virtue of its smaller, more intimate nature \u2013 especially when you consider that that it's one of the lowest-grossing films to ever win the coveted award. No, five years from now we'd probably be watching it on Netflix or Amazon, because the big studios wouldn't want to take a chance and release such a risky proposition at the box office.  Either we get with the times and accept that streaming is here and can be a compelling option for many smaller, character-driven films \u2013 providing them with a home they likely wouldn't find otherwise \u2013 or we prepare ourselves for a future where Pirates of the Caribbean XII is up for serious awards contention.", "stock": "NFLX", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-26", "source": "techradar", "url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/why-steven-spielberg-is-wrong-about-netflix"}, {"article": "When Sky Q launched two years ago, it was positioned as the ultimate home entertainment package but it had one big thing missing: Netflix.  The streaming service, already available on Sky-rival Virgin for some time, was nowhere to be seen. It was clear a deal wasn\u2019t done and it\u2019s taken longer than most thought for something to be put in place. But now it's official: Netflix is coming to Sky, in a first-of-its-kind partnership.  It\u2019s been revealed that Netflix won\u2019t just be available as a standalone app through Sky Q but a brand-new entertainment package. And if you are already a Netflix subscriber, then you just sign in and off you go.  This is significant, as it ties the two services together and should mean that the experience is that bit more seamless. We expect Netflix will still keep some of its identity but you only have to look at what Sky has done with the BBC iPlayer - another streaming service that is very protective of its IP - to make sure it blends in with the Sky UI.  This makes the deal somewhat different to the one Virgin Media has, where it pretty much just offers the Netflix app within its user interface, albeit in a dedicated section. It will also mean that Sky\u2019s great voice search functionality will now work with Netflix.  Sky and Netflix up a tree  Why is Netflix joining Sky so important? Well, there are myriad reasons. It marks a sea change for how Sky operates.  It overhauled its platform to take on the streaming giants. Sky Q was all about opening up its channels so they can be watched on TV, through an app, pause and played throughout the house. Sky was no longer tied to the TV experience but device agnostic.  This was functionality new to Sky customers but familiar to anyone who uses Netflix (or Amazon Prime) which comes at a far lower price than Sky subscription service.  Sky has been consistently updating its Sky Q service  Sky housing Netflix will mean it can now boast to being one of the largest holders of UHD and, subsequently, HDR content around - a key feature that's needed if you truly want to be a next-gen TV offering.  Then there\u2019s the small business of how you pay for Netflix. Currently, if you pay for Netflix direct then Netflix gets all your money. But there are deals around. For instance, you can get Netflix or Spotify through certain Vodafone contracts. And Sky is now doing a similar thing; getting both Spotify and Netflix through Sky will mean your payment will be migrated to Sky\u2019s service and that\u2019s a very powerful thing for Sky to have.  Keeping it simple  For the user, it simplifies things. It may feel like everyone and their dog has a Netflix account but it\u2019s likely many Sky customers have yet to make the leap as they are already paying a premium for a huge amount of content. We certainly haven\u2019t yet seen the mass migration away from the likes of Sky and Virgin to Netflix, which shows the services are still treated quite differently by users and proves maybe they can actually live alongside each other.  Netflix has been very clever to go after cord cutters in the way they market the service - no contract, you can stop at any time... these are important messages to have. This link-up with Sky reattaches the cord and opens up potential new customers for Netflix, though, ones that perhaps dismissed it before.  Having Netflix also on the Now TV Smart Stick will mean that it's building up its app ecosystem which is certain to help it long term, if and when it does eventually get rid of the satellite dish.  Stranger Things will be one of the shows available through Sky Q  The TV landscape is changing and Sky is doing all it can to stay relevant. It\u2019s investing heavily in original content but can\u2019t match Netflix\u2019s promise of \u2018700 new shows\u2019 this year. This tie-up means it doesn\u2019t have to, it can piggy back on Netflix's investment.  It also means that Netflix is no longer a choice over Sky but one that sits alongside. Oh, and those who already have both Sky and Netflix will finally be able to stop the HDMI swapping or Smart TV app hunting to watch Netflix when the link-up happens later in the year.  Making things easier for the viewer is one feature that should never be underestimated.", "stock": "NFLX", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-01", "source": "techradar", "url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/sky-and-netflix-finally-chill-and-pave-the-way-for-the-future-of-broadcasting"}, {"article": "Since its arrival on Australian shores, we've enjoyed unfettered access to all of Netflix's critically-lauded original shows. Not only that, users also have access to a wealth of other licensed material.  If you're like us, you spend a good deal of your time Netflixing. Sure, Netflix also streams movies, but its television output is perhaps the reason most people have signed up for an account. There's nothing quite like firing up Netflix and binge-watching a series at your own pace. Getting instant access to entire seasons of Stranger Things from day one is half the appeal.

Rapture  Fans of hip-hop will definitely want to check out Rapture, the new Netflix Original documentary series which spends each episode with a different major player in the rap game, kicking off with Logic and featuring T.I., Just Blaze, 2 Chainz and more over the course of its entire run. in Rapture, the artists themselves are tasked with describing their careers, how they got to where they are, and what kind of cultural legacy they think they'll leave behind. Candid interviews with the artists and the people around them provide an eye-opening insight into a world that's not quite as it seems on the surface.  Seasons on Netflix: 1  2. Wild Wild Country  This six-part documentary series tells the almost-unbelievable story of a utopian cult that was founded by a charismatic Indian guru and went on to build its own city in the Oregon desert. Told using news stories and archival footage from the city\u2019s heyday in combination with present-day interviews with those who were there, the slowly-escalating series jumps from free love to stoushes between cult members and local Oregonians and culminates in attempted assassinations, legal battles, bombings and mass poisonings. It\u2019ll leave you wondering who\u2019s really in the right \u2014 and pondering what rules people are willing to break as they attempt to hold on to power. Wild Wild Country is one wild, wild ride.  Seasons on Netflix: 1  3. Santa Clarita Diet  Like a cross between Modern Family and The Walking Dead (with a spattering of Dexter thrown in for good measure), Santa Clarita Diet is a hilariously gory Netflix Original series that sees suburban mum Sheila (Drew Barrymore) suddenly acquire an insatiable hunger for human flesh. Though shocked at first, Sheila's loyal husband Joel (Timothy Olyphant) and daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) are determined to keep this family together, even if it means covering up a number of murders...  Seasons on Netflix: 2  4. Riverdale  Set aside any pre-conceived notions that you might have about a 'sexy Archie' series and get ready for one of the most addictive new shows of the year with Riverdale. First things first \u2014 this ain't your grandpappy's Archie show. A modern day re-imagining of the beloved comics franchise that has spanned almost eight decades, this Twin Peaks-inspired version of Riverdale is fraught with murder, deception and small town scandal. Famous characters like Jughead, Veronica, Betty and even Josie and the Pussycats are all present and accounted for, only with a decidedly millennial twist. The question on everybody's lips: Who killed star quarterback (and most popular kid in school) Jason Blossom? With new episodes fast-tracked from the US every Thursday, your only problem will the seven day wait between episodes.  Seasons on Netflix: 2  5. The Defiant Ones  Charting the rise of one of the world's most successful business partnerships, The Defiant Ones delves into the lives of Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre \u2014 two men who not only conquered the music industry, but whose famous Beats Electronics brand went on to become a $3 billion player in the tech world with its sale to Apple in 2014. Featuring a huge number of candid interviews from major music industry titans, including Bono, Eminem, Tom Petty, Stevie Nicks, Bruce Springstein, Gwen Stefani, Trent Reznor and more, this three-part documentary series (which is considered a Netflix Original in Australia despite being made by HBO) is a must-watch for music lovers and people fascinated by those who display an incredible business acumen.  Seasons on Netflix: 1  6. Marvel's Jessica Jones  In retrospect, it would seem impossible for Marvel to surpass its first Netflix Original series, Daredevil, with a show about a hard drinking ex-superhero that's little known outside of comic book circles, but that's pretty much what it's done with Jessica Jones. Though the show doesn't quite reach the action heights of Daredevil, Jessica Jones manages to be even more compelling in terms of story and character. Based on the comic Alias by Brian Michael Bendis, the first season of the show sees private investigator Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter), bar owner Luke Cage (Mike Colter) and celebrity Trish Walker (Rachael Taylor) do battle with a mind-controlling creep named Kilgrave (David Tennant), whose incredible obsession with Jessica is causing everyone around her to die. The second season follows on from the events of Marvel's The Defenders, and finds Jones delving into her past in order to make sense of her latest case. Dark, violent and quite sexual for a Marvel show, Jessica Jones is required viewing for fans of the MCU.  Seasons on Netflix: 2  7. Queer Eye  Queer Eye is back! While the original Fab Five are nowhere to be seen, a new team has been put together with the same ultimate mission: to remodel individuals into the best possible version of themselves, whether it be their wardrobe, living arrangements, grooming, diet or even their confidence. We know, makeover shows are usually pretty lame, but this one is fantastic in the way that the guys really get to the emotional heart of each subject they undertake. Often, there's a reason these men (who aren't all straight this time around) have let themselves go or have put up defensive walls against the outside world. Because the Fab Five really seem to care about them, it becomes incredibly rewarding to watch them go from unhappy to full of life. Chances are you'll cry at least once per episode.  Seasons on Netflix: 1  8. Everything Sucks!  Don't be put off by its twee trailers and the 1990s nostalgia-bait that lies therein \u2014 Everything Sucks! is actually a very endearing series that follows a group of young high schoolers (and their parents) as they struggle with new found feelings of love. It's the first day of high school for Luke (Jahi Di'Allo Winston) and his geeky friends, and the boys immediately meet Kate (Peyton Kennedy), the principal's daughter, in AV Club. Luke falls for her right away, but there's one problem \u2014 Kate is starting to realise that she actually likes girls. Meanwhile, Kate's widower dad (Patch Darragh) and Luke's single mother (Claudine Mboligikpelani Nako) have started a secret relationship, and it's only a matter of time before everything blows up in their faces. Funny and surprisingly heartfelt, Everything Sucks! is much more than a '90s-set Freaks and Geeks clone.  Seasons on Netflix: 1  9. Altered Carbon  Based on the science fiction novel of the same name by Richard K. Morgan, Altered Carbon explores a futuristic world where death has become an inconvenience rather than a permanent state. A human's entire life can be backed up onto a chip in their neck, so when they die, they can move onto to a different body and continue on in another form. But when a wealthy man's chip is destroyed by a would-be assassin (lucky he's rich enough to have a 24-hour satellite backup), he brings Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman) out of digital prison after 250 years to solve his murder. Kovacs is the last remaining Envoy, a super soldier who is now tasked with working for the very people he fought a war against. With an epic scope and a visual style influenced by the cyberpunk classic Blade Runner, Altered Carbon is the most epic show that Netflix has produced to date.  Seasons of Netflix: 1  10. Ugly Delicious  A documentary series that simultaneously celebrates food while asking why we like it in the first place, Ugly Delicious is a must-watch for any food lover. World-renowned chef David Chang takes us on a culinary journey, exploring the foods we cherish, from pizza to barbecue and everything in between. Rather than just show us the best forms of each dish, Chang's approach is entirely different, looking back at the history and ethnography of each meal and asking us to do away with our food elitism. It's only then that we can open our minds up to the endless possibilities of what food can actually be.  Seasons on Netflix: 1  Want to know more about Netflix's take on binging?

That's apparently the thinking behind a new feature currently being tested on the video streaming service, which rewards children with stickers when they watch certain shows.

At the moment at least, that's all the reward that they get \u2013 there's no other incentive to race through a whole series of Paw Patrol.  It would seem that only a small subsection of Netflix users have the feature enabled for the time being, so it's by no means definite that this is going to roll out for everyone.

One of the most notable things the Netflix chief mentioned is that his streaming service doesn't have any plans whatsoever to do live TV, even if rivals like Hulu and Amazon's Prime Video are investing heavily in that space. \"To follow a competitor, never, never, never,\" he said. \"We have so much we want to do in our area, so we're not trying to copy others, whether that's linear cable, there's lots of things we don't do. We don't do [live] news, we don't do [live] sports. But what we do do, we try to do really well.\"  He said that while \"all of these media companies\" are trying to get into video, specifically newcomers such as Facebook, Netflix has been competing with seasons rivals like Amazon for a decade and he's happy with the success of his company thus far. Earlier this year, during its Q4 2017 earnings report, Netflix announced that it added 8.3 million new customers that quarter, its largest single-quarter growth ever. Those numbers certainly seem to bolster Hasting's confidence. He said that, while it's a very competitive market at the moment -- and it's only going to get tougher with others like Facebook and YouTube joining the fray -- he believes that if Netflix continues to produce great series and content, it has nothing to worry about.  \"If we do our own Prime service, we'll never succeed,\" he said, referring to the idea that Netflix could offer something beyond its on-demand content. He added that what hurts Netflix's competitors is that \"their strategy is to win by being broad, you know, a little bit of everything.\" Hastings said it's also key to ensure customers that they're never going to see ads on a Netflix product, despite the potential for lower prices and creating more revenue. Hastings didn't have to mention Hulu or YouTube by name to know those are the platforms he was referring to. \"Really having great experience -- no advertisements or chopping up all of the content -- vastly outweigh the fact that one company is gaining a lot of influence.\"", "stock": "NFLX", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-07", "source": "engadget", "url": "https://www.engadget.com/2018/03/07/netflix-ceo-reed-hastings-live-tv-disney-marvel/"}, {"article": "For Netflix, a fifth season is practically music to its ears.

It isn\u2019t wrong.  The streaming service reported earnings per share of 41 cents, up from 15 cents a year ago, and revenue of $3.29 billion, slightly beating analysts\u2019 estimates of $3.28 billion. Most impressively, it added 8.3 million subscribers globally\u2014the highest in the company\u2019s history\u2014even as it raised its subscription price to $11 a month. That is an 18% year-over-year increase, exceeding the company\u2019s own forecast of 6.3 million subscribers. Shares shot up 9% in after hours trading.  Legacy media, says Rich Greenfield of BTIG Research, should \u201cbe afraid, be very afraid.\u201d With hit content like \u201cStranger Things\u201d and \u201cThe Crown,\u201d Netflix has created a virtuous cycle: Subscribers keep joining at higher price points, allowing the company to spend more on content, which in turn allows them to draw in and retain more subscribers.  Of the over 8 million new subscribers, 6.36 million came from international markets. They have finally made Netflix\u2019s global segments profitable, delivering earnings of $227 million in 2017.  With an eye on competition, the company is accelerating its investments for 2018. It will raise marketing spending to $2 billion and spend $7.5 billion to $8 billion on new content, including 30 international original series in places like Poland, India, and Japan.  \u201cThis is a land grab opportunity,\u201d says Mr. Greenfield. \u201cThey see Disney , Apple , Amazon coming, and they\u2019re trying to extend their lead as far as possible before the competition gets going.\u201d  Netflix is slated to have a long lead indeed. Disney, which hopes to break into international markets with its acquisition of assets from 21st Century Fox , will find that Netflix has already beaten them there. It also plans to launch its own Disney-branded streaming service. Yet this likely won\u2019t happen before late 2019. Meanwhile, Hulu, in which Disney will have a 60% stake after the Fox deal, has added far fewer subscribers than Netflix even though it maintains a lower price.  Hit shows from HBO and Amazon will draw viewers. But content is unique, meaning streaming services can coexist comfortably. As long as Netflix continues producing such popular content, viewers will keep watching, and recently they are watching even more. In 2017, streaming hours per membership grew by 9% year-over-year.  Netflix\u2019s already ugly balance sheet will look even worse next year with negative free cash flow of $3 billion to $4 billion. The company expects to sell more high-yield bonds. None of that has mattered so far to its soaring stock price\u2014its market cap hit $100 billion\u2014or to its bonds.

Photo: facundo arrizabalaga/epa-efe/rex/EPA/Shutterstock  The world\u2019s media titans are locked in battle over Sky. The company driving the multibillion-dollar bidding drama is happily sitting on the couch: Netflix . NFLX 0.78%  Comcast gate-crashed an already lively party Tuesday by offering \u00a312.50 ($17.50) a share for Sky. That is 12% more than the \u00a310.75 on offer from 21st Century Fox and, by extension, Disney , DIS -0.04% which wants to buy Sky along with other Fox assets.  Including debt, the Comcast offer values Sky at $41 billion, which works out at 13 times expected earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, according to FactSet. Dish Network, traditionally a satellite distributor like Sky, trades on roughly five times Ebitda, after stripping out its spectrum assets, according to Will Milner at research house Arete.  Admittedly, Sky has a much stronger market position than Dish. It was the U.K.\u2019s first pay-TV company, with an offer anchored by Premier League soccer, and it has kept at the forefront of industry innovations like the set-top box and \u201cover-the-top\u201d streaming. As a result, it still serves more than twice as many U.K. households as its closest peer, Liberty Global\u2019s Virgin Media cable network.  This is Sky\u2019s essential appeal to both Comcast and Disney. It has a direct relationship with 23 million customers, not far from Comcast\u2019s 29 million. And they are mainly in markets\u2014the U.K. and Ireland\u2014that are already familiar with the kind of English-language TV content that both Comcast and Disney own and produce. In this Sky has no real peers.  Streaming giant Netflix\u2019s high stock-market valuation shows the appeal to investors of a global \u201cdirect-to-consumer\u201d platform. Something of this high valuation is now rubbing off on Sky as Disney and Comcast are both feeling increasing pressure to roll out something that competes with Netflix.  Both U.S. cable-and-media groups look set to be major beneficiaries of U.S. tax cuts, giving them cash to splurge. And given the antitrust uncertainty surrounding AT&T\u2019s bid for Time Warner, it is easy to see why Comcast has opted to focus on Sky rather than Fox. For regulators, Comcast may be the preferred bidder, with none of the issues about concentration of ownership in British media that have dogged Fox\u2019s bid.  The irony here is that Sky is itself being disrupted by streaming. Its growth has become increasingly dependent on its own over-the-top product, Now TV, which is much cheaper than its old full-service package. Some 2% to 3% of households are trading down from the premium package to Now TV a year. Stripping out mobile-phone contracts, research firm New Street Research estimates that Sky\u2019s U.K. subscription revenue\u2014the bedrock of its business\u2014rose just 0.8% year over year in the most recent quarter. Meanwhile, heavy technology investments have weighed on cash flows.  Sky shares rose to \u00a313.40 in afternoon trading Tuesday, suggesting investors expect a counteroffer from Fox or Disney. But the U.S. media giants should be wary of engaging in a bidding war for what is essentially an incumbent TV provider. Sky could end up part of the problem, not part of the solution.  The cable industry is undergoing a major transformation, as more Americans cut the cord on their cable subscriptions and flock to streaming services like Hulu and Netflix. So how did we get here?

The company added 8.3 million streaming users\u2014the most it has ever gained in a quarter\u2014exceeding the 6.3 million net additions it had projected. The growth in the U.S. and internationally brought its total paid subscriber count to 110.6 million at the end of the fourth quarter.  The results showed Netflix can continue to grow its customer ranks despite price increases in the U.S. and rising competition for viewers and programming from rival streaming services. Netflix shares gained 9% after hours, pushing the company\u2019s market capitalization above $100 billion.  In a letter to shareholders, Netflix acknowledged the emergence of more premium video content from technology companies like Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc., ad-supported platforms such as Facebook and Google\u2019s YouTube, and entertainment companies like Walt Disney Co. , which underscored its direct-to-consumer ambitions when it agreed to purchase most of 21st Century Fox for $52.4 billion.  \u201cThe market for entertainment time is vast and can support many successful services,\u201d the company said in the letter. \u201cEntertainment services are often complementary given their unique content offerings.\u201d  The expansion of direct-to-consumer video gave viewers an all-time high of 487 scripted shows across streaming and traditional TV in 2017, according to research from FX Networks.  Los Gatos, Calif.-based Netflix has been spending heavily on original programs to attract new subscribers. Netflix said Monday it would spend $7.5 billion to $8 billion on content this year, up from a forecast of $7 billion to $8 billion previously, far outstripping investments from rivals including Hulu, Amazon and HBO.  And Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings said on the company\u2019s earnings call that content costs will continue to rise in 2019 and 2020.  Netflix said it now has $17.7 billion in streaming-content obligations, a measure of current and future costs for content acquisition, licensing and production.  In a rare move, the company took a $39 million noncash charge in the fourth quarter on content it decided not to release, which Chief Financial Officer David Wells said was \u201crelated to the societal reset around sexual harassment.\u201d Last year, Netflix cut ties with actor Kevin Spacey after he was accused of sexual harassment, and the streaming service said it would bring the hit drama \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d back for one final season without Mr. Spacey.  Netflix also said it would boost its spending on technology and increase its marketing budget to $2 billion this year from $1.3 billion.

But the company said Monday that rising operating profits and slowing growth in original content spending will eventually lead to positive free cash flow.  \u201cThey are spending more on content and burning more cash,\u201d Anthony DiClemente, internet analyst at Evercore ISI, said. \u201cHowever, as long as the revenue growth is accelerating and the net subscriber additions continue, investors will look past the spending.\u201d  Netflix shares set a record closing price on Monday at $227.58, about 227 times earnings.  The company added 6.36 million foreign subscribers in the quarter, compared with its forecast of 5.05 million. It added 1.98 million U.S. subscribers, compared with its outlook for 1.25 million.  Netflix expects the growth to continue in the current quarter, projecting net additions of 1.45 million U.S. subscribers and 4.9 million international customers.  Netflix has increased its international investments in recent years. More than half of its total subscribers are from countries outside the U.S. and it plans over 30 international-focused original series this year, including in France, Poland, India and Korea. Monday, the company said the international segment contributed positively to the company\u2019s full-year profit for the first time.  Netflix said revenue increased 33% to $3.29 billion in its fourth quarter, above analysts\u2019 estimates.  Net income came in at $185.5 million, or 41 cents a share, compared with $66.7 million, or 15 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter.

Such is the case with \u201crisk adjustment\u201d in health care. Medical spending is not spread evenly across all people in society. Half the population uses hardly any care in a given year\u2014only 3% of total spending. Conversely, 10% of Americans consume about two-thirds of all health-care spending.  Consequently, when someone buys an ObamaCare plan or enrolls in a Medicare Advantage managed-care plan, the federal government needs to adjust the fixed premium (or subsidy) it pays to account for how sick the person is. Patients who have serious conditions come with bigger government payments. Without this adjustment, insurers and health-care providers would have a strong incentive to care only for healthy people.  Photo: istock/getty images  While the concept sounds simple, risk adjustment is among the factors that make health care so maddeningly complicated. For an \u201caverage patient\u201d in Erie County, N.Y., the government will pay a private insurer offering a Medicare Advantage plan roughly $9,500 a year. But for a patient with lung cancer, diabetes with complications, depression and macular degeneration, risk adjustment triples the amount to just over $27,000 a year.  That large difference is intended to ensure that the sick patient can continue to get care. But consider the incentives it sets up. As every physician knows, many diseases are diagnosed and their severity assessed based on clinical judgment as opposed to objective criteria. Others may be under control or no longer relevant and aptly characterized as \u201cpast medical history.\u201d Finally, many conditions emerge in almost everyone with age.  Risk adjustment gives doctors and Medicare Advantage insurers a financial reason to ignore these nuances. Instead they have incentives to find every possible diagnosis\u2014and then to make the patient\u2019s conditions sound as severe as possible\u2014so as to raise government payments the most.  This gaming is pervasive enough to have a name: up-coding. In 2016 the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services audited 37 Medicare Advantage health plans. Thirty-five had overcharged the government, commonly by overstating the severity of diabetes and depression. A 2016 study from the Government Accountability Office suggests this practice costs taxpayers billions of dollars a year in overpayments.  Because Medicare cannot police every plan, it has attacked the problem with a sledgehammer, enacting an annual \u201ccoding intensity adjustment,\u201d which in 2018 will reduce premiums by \u201cat least 5.91%.\u201d But this adjustment, which insurers aggressively lobby to minimize, penalizes honest Medicare Advantage plans, too. Ultimately, it does not solve the problem because insurers build the \u201cpenalty\u201d into their premiums.  Up-coding also diverts providers and insurers from finding ways to improve care and reduce costs. This effect is reinforced by the Affordable Care Act\u2019s \u201cmedical loss ratio\u201d rules, which require insurers to spend at least 85% of premiums on clinical care. The only way to increase profits, then, is to raise revenues while keeping administrative costs the same. Gaming risk adjustment is an easy way to do that.  Doctors find risk adjustment incredibly frustrating. Medicare Advantage plans torment them with reminders to do annual visits, in the guise of \u201cwellness visits,\u201d to code every disease in every patient. A whole industry of opportunistic intermediaries like Inovalon, hired by health-insurance companies, support up-coding by retrieving patient charts, mining them for abnormal lab values or prescriptions indicative of diseases that aren\u2019t being billed, and then faxing back \u201csuggestions\u201d for added diagnoses. This distracts doctors, provides no value for patients, and sucks tons of money out of the system.  How to clean up this mess? Begin by acknowledging that current methods of risk adjustment are not very good. On average, the factors used by Medicare today\u2014mainly data from past claims\u2014can account for only about 36% of the true variation in patient spending due to disease. That means lots of extra money is flowing for diagnoses that do not necessarily imply the assumed increased costs.  One way for Medicare to do better would be to emulate Netflix . Beginning in 2006, Netflix ran a world-wide contest to improve Cinematch, its proprietary algorithm for predicting how users would rate films they\u2019d never seen. The grand prize was $1 million. Within a year, over 2,000 separate teams from 150 countries had submitted more than 13,000 algorithms. Eventually, the winning team, which included researchers from AT&T Labs, Yahoo and an Austrian consulting firm, improved the algorithm by more than 10%. For a tiny cost, Netflix got a huge amount of computer-science research that even its highly skilled employees could not perform.  Medicare should do the same: create a contest open to anyone in the world who can beat its current risk-adjustment model. To ensure fairness and encourage competition, administering it should be outsourced to the X Prize Foundation or a similar group. The winner should be able to use objective patient data to account for at least 45% of the spending variation caused by disease. Medicare could award a $10 million grand prize and several million for second and third place. It also should be required to adopt one of the top methods. (There may be practical reasons not to pick the winner.)  To prevent insurers from figuring out how to game this updated risk-adjustment model, Medicare should run a new contest every five to seven years. Tens of millions in prize money could save taxpayers tens of billions a year in up-coding gimmicks.

The streaming video giant\u2019s stock is down 4.9% in the first two days of the week to about $316, a rare pullback for shares that have more than doubled over the last 12 months and climbed 22% in the last month alone. The gains have outshone many of Netflix\u2019s high-flying tech-focused peers.  The recent drop followed remarks by short-seller Andrew Left of Citron Research, who said in a tweet Monday that shares, \u201ccan be shorted back to $300,\u201d after the company\u2019s market cap surged in the preceding week.  \u201cI think the market has become over-enthused by the product and not realistic about the economics,\u201d he said in an interview. Mr. Left, who is known for shorting such companies as Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc., said he is currently betting against the stock.  Netflix shares have a long history of momentum-driven growth that\u2019s drawn passionate arguments from both bulls and bears. The company has posted consistently strong subscriber growth and invested heavily in its original content. It\u2019s also been burning through cash and borrowing heavily. It faces a slew of upstart rivals, from Amazon.com Inc. to Walt Disney Co.  Scott Devitt, an analyst at Stifel, recently dropped his rating on the company to \u201chold,\u201d from \u201cbuy.\u201d In a report to clients last week, he wrote that the \u201cshare price may have sprinted ahead of fundamentals in the short-term.\u201d  The company\u2019s chief executive, Reed Hastings, has counted himself among the stock price skeptics in the past. In the summer of 2015, when the stock was at about $100, Mr. Hastings said in response to a question about whether the stock is overpriced: \u201cwhen the stock was half this price, I described it as euphoric. So it\u2019s a mystery to me.\u201d  Still, the recent surge has its benefits, the company has said. In a recent quarterly letter, the company noted that a thick \u201cequity cushion\u201d has been good for its borrowing in the junk bond market. The company has about $6.5 billion in total debt, according to FactSet, and its bond prices have held up relatively well recently. A spokesman for the firm declined to comment.  The Netflix critics have had a tough run recently. The stock had an average short position worth $5.5 billion so far this year, which has sustained paper losses of nearly $3 billion in 2018 through the end of last week, according to financial analytics firm S3 Partners. So far this week, they\u2019ve made back about $319 million.  Short sellers bet against a stock by borrowing from a lender and selling it, hoping to buy it back at a lower price when they return it later on. They pocket the difference if the stock has fallen, but can expose themselves to sharp losses if it rises, as Netflix has done.  The number of shorted shares has fallen recently as investors pared their positions. Many have bumped up against limits on how much risk they can take as the stock price has risen, according to Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3. Short interest as a share of float hit an all-time low of just under 5% last month, as fewer shares were shorted and the number of outstanding shares increased.  \u2013 Ken Jimenez and Sam Goldfarb contributed to this article", "stock": "NFLX", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-13", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2018/03/13/netflixs-massive-rally-draws-attention-of-skeptics/"}, {"article": "The biggest antitrust trial since U.S. v.

That\u2019s something on the order of 1,000 hours, or 40 full days, of binge watching. Some of these efforts are great, some are good, and most are just filler, like \u201c Bill Nye Saves the World.\u201d But so what? The point is they are distributed on the internet, via cable modems or mobile phones. AT&T and Time Warner have little influence, and nobody\u2014from ABC to HBO\u2014has a lock on entertainment these days.  Netflix has 55 million American subscribers and, gulp, raised its prices in November. Netflix doesn\u2019t license its shows to anyone else in the U.S.! Should the government break it up? By the way, that \u201cSouth Park\u201d episode is available on Viacom \u2019s Comedy Central, though Hulu\u2019s 17 million subscribers can also watch it online.  Amazon Prime has something like 80 million subscribers in the U.S., and 26 million of them watch the company\u2019s original content. Google\u2019s YouTube is now offering streaming TV, basically a $40-a-month substitute for cable. Similarly, Hulu has Live TV and Sony has PlayStation Vue. All March Madness games can be streamed online. Consumers have choices.  And we\u2019re just getting started. Worried about cord-cutting, Disney has paid $2.5 billion for a 75% stake in BAMTech, Major League Baseball\u2019s streaming company. RBC analyst Steven Cahall suggests Disney could spend $15 billion a year on streaming shows. That partially explains why Mickey Mouse is chasing 21st Century Fox .  Or look at the raw figures. Programming is a $90-billion-a-year business. Both Fox and Time Warner spend around $8 billion on nonsports content. Netflix spent $6 billion last year and hopes to hit $8 billion in 2018. Amazon spends $5 billion. Where is the market dominance?  Apple has sold more than a billion iPhones and is spending $1 billion this year getting its feet wet with original programming. The company recently put up millions for two seasons of a show about, ugh, a TV morning show, produced and starring Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston. If anything, extreme competition has shifted the balance of power to actors\u2014or, as some in Silicon Valley call them, meat puppets.  The AT&T antitrust case smells quite similar to the arguments for net neutrality, which also ignore real competition and emerging technologies. The feds are chasing ghosts. As they should be well aware, vertically structured companies tend to fall ill or die from natural causes\u2014see General Motors , IBM and, well, AT&T. No one pays 25 cents a minute for long-distance calls anymore.  Still, I\u2019m not sure why AT&T needs to get in bed with Hollywood, which year after year degrades the meaning of \u201cBest Picture.\u201d AT&T should instead return to a focus on technical excellence.

VZ -0.17% and Comcast Corp. CMCSA -0.33% are in tight competition for least-inspiring telecom company.  Cable network subscribers have gone from single-digit growth, to flat and now to declining. For Verizon and Comcast, both of which reported fourth-quarter earnings this week, those losses are getting worse as subscribers opt for streaming services like Netflix.  Verizon lost 29,000 Fios video customers this quarter, up from 18,000 in the third quarter and 15,000 in the second. Comcast similarly reported a loss of 33,000 video customers, an increase from 22,390 last quarter.  The erosion is unlikely to slow soon. \u201cWe don\u2019t expect the level of competition to diminish,\u201d Comcast said of the video sector.  \u201cWhy watch live TV?\u201d says Rich Greenfield of BTIG Research. \u201cThe amount of content on demand has gotten really good, really fast. And cable networks are competing not just against new shows, but against every great show ever made.\u201d  Verizon offset these losses as more customers signed up for wireless plans and high-speed internet. It narrowly missed analysts\u2019 expectations, reporting 86 cents per share, rather than 88 cents, and revenue of $33.96 billion. Savings from tax cuts will give it $3.5 billion to $4 billion in extra cash, boosting full-year earnings. Shares are up 1% since it announced results on Tuesday.  Comcast\u2019s results were stronger, reporting 49 cents per share above the 47-cent estimates, and revenue of $21.92 billion. It will use its tax windfall to increase its dividend by 21% and buy back $5 billion in stock this year. Investors are likely disappointed that the company wasn\u2019t more aggressive in its share buybacks. Shares were flat after the announcement on Wednesday.  \u201cIt\u2019s impolitic to buy back too much at once. Trump has said he doesn\u2019t want that to happen,\u201d said Craig Moffett, a media analyst at MoffettNathanson.  The buyback also leaves little room for acquisitions. Despite a deal-making rush in the industry, Verizon similarly insisted that it will not seek a merger.  Neither company looks compelling for the foreseeable future. But with strong growth in its NBCUniversal business and the Super Bowl and Winter Olympics expected to bring in $1.4 billion in ad revenue, Comcast remains slightly less uninspiring.  The cable industry is undergoing a major transformation, as more Americans cut the cord on their cable subscriptions and flock to streaming services like Hulu and Netflix. So how did we get here?

While the FANG companies\u2019 dominance in areas from social media to e-commerce will foster faster growth, their multiples are eye-watering.  Valuation Case  At 65 times earnings in mid March, the group was valued almost three times as richly as the S&P 500 Index. That\u2019s comparable with tech stocks in March 2000.  Since peaking on March 12, the FANG index has fallen in all but three days, sliding 12 percent along the way. Tuesday\u2019s drop wiped off about $180 billion in market value.  \u201cThe fact that the tech selloff accelerated in afternoon on heavy volume probably means a selloff will continue,\" said Stephen Carl, head trader at Williams Capital Group. \u201cOne thing is feeding into another here: uncertainty over the tariffs, Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony, weakness in Tesla.

Thanks to fresh blows to companies from Nvidia Corp. to Facebook Inc., the biggest industry in the S&P 500 Index dropped 3.5 percent, the biggest decline since the broad market selloff reached its worst point on Feb. 8. The Nasdaq 100 Index sank for a ninth decline in 11 days. Facebook gave up gains to slump 4.9 percent, with Mark Zuckerberg expected to appear before a House committee in the latest development in the company\u2019s escalating privacy scandal.  While the loss pales in comparison to last week\u2019s worst tumble since 2015, the renewed weakness underscores the vulnerability in an industry whose growth prospects have lured investors, spurring stock gains that have doubled the market in the past three years. That leadership has repeatedly been threatened in the past year as the government stepped up regulations and strategists warned over the risk of momentum unwinding.  \u201cGrowth was the thing to buy,\u201d said Gary Bradshaw, a portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management in Dallas. \u201cNow the markets are starting to see some chips in the armor.

The NYSE FANG+ index plunged 5.6 percent, its biggest drop on record.  Facebook, under growing criticism that the social media company has failed to protect user privacy, extended its worst quarterly decline since 2012 as Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg is expected to testify before the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee. The stock tumbled 4.9 percent, closing at the lowest level since July.  Nvidia, the graphics-chip maker that has been seeking to expand in the automotive market, fell 7.8 percent after temporarily suspending its self-driving vehicle testing.  In other tech moves:  Twitter tumbled 12 percent after Citron disclosed a short bet on the stock and said the company is the most vulnerable to \u201cprivacy regulation\u201d among social media peers.  Netflix, the second-best performing stock in the S&P 500 this year, fell 6.1 percent in a rare pullback. The stock is still up 57 percent for the year.  Apple Inc. held up the best among tech megacaps, although it still fell 2.6 percent, after releasing a new iPad focused on schools and a new education service called Schoolwork at an event in Chicago.  \u2014 With assistance by Elena Popina, and Jeran Wittenstein", "stock": "NVDA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-27", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-27/tech-stocks-tumble-again-in-sudden-wave-of-afternoon-selling"}, {"article": "Wednesday was a bad day for Amazon.com Inc. shares, even though the company did nothing wrong. The computer-chip maker Nvidia Corp. didn't fumble an earnings forecast, but its stock tumbled this week, too. Facebook Inc.'s financial power hasn't weakened (so far), yet it has shed a Morgan Stanley worth of market value in two weeks.  Right now, investors worry technology companies might succumb not to competition or business missteps, but to consequences of their own hubris or market power. It all feels overdue, but also odd. We've been writing for so long about the looming technology reckoning that it's surprising to realize investors finally care.  Amazon's stock price fell 4.4 percent on Wednesday after Axios reported that President Donald Trump is \"obsessed\" with the e-commerce titan and imagines ways to curtail its power. In a tweet on Thursday, Trump confirmed that he's concerned about Amazon's impact on cities and states, the U.S. Postal Service and smaller retailers. In response, Amazon shares are falling in early trading.  Facebook has dropped since revelations that a political consulting firm took advantage of the company's formerly lax data rules. Nvidia shares are down almost 10 percent this week after the company said it would suspend tests of driverless cars on public roads in response to an Uber autonomous car hitting and killing a pedestrian. (Nvidia provides technology for Uber's autonomous cars.)  Feeling the Pain A half dozen prominent U.S. tech companies have lost more than $80 billion of combined stock market value this week Source: Bloomberg  These companies aren't all faultless victims. Amazon is not a cuddly charity. Years of Facebook's cavalier attitude about data privacy and the downsides of its social network have created this crisis. Right now, though, investors are realizing that tech companies are so big, pervasive and economically important that suspicion is a permanent fact of life now, and backlash has become a real cost of doing business.  I was both surprised, and not, at Amazon's stock reaction. The U.S. president's antipathy for Amazon or CEO Jeff Bezos is no secret. Last summer, Trump tweeted a not-quite-accurate criticism about Amazon's tax payments. He also said previously that Amazon had a \"huge antitrust problem,\" and tweeted that the company is hurting U.S. cities and states. In December and again in Thursday's tweet, Trump said the U.S. Postal Service's finances were hurt by its business with Amazon. (That one is more complicated than 280 characters can convey). It's tough to know whether Trump truly believes Amazon is causing harm, or whether he harbors a grudge against the Bezos-owned Washington Post. Maybe both.  Trump isn't alone in questioning Amazon's power, but there's not an easy legal weapon to wield. Axios said Trump has \"talked about changing Amazon's tax treatment,\" but it's not clear how tax changes could specifically target Amazon. The company is well-regarded by consumers. Amazon is a bogeyman of many industries, but it only captures perhaps a few percentage points of total U.S. retail spending. Conventional approaches to antitrust law don't apply easily to Amazon, although some academics have said the applications of the law need to change. And needless to say, the White House doesn't directly control U.S. antitrust authorities.  Losing Their Bite An index of 10 large global technology companies, including Facebook and Apple, has dipped 14 percent from a mid-March peak Source: Bloomberg  Assuming Trump's tweet barrage against Amazon doesn't continue, the company's stock decline is likely to be short-lived. But investors' temporary panic is understandable. It's far better for powerful tech companies like Amazon to fly under the radar right now. Apple and Amazon should have sent thank-you cards to Mark Zuckerberg for drawing 100 percent of the fire recently from members of Congress, global regulators and skeptical tech journalists. But the fresh glimpse at Trump's thinking showed that there's plenty of unwanted attention to go around for the tech giants.  There's also general investor rethinking -- not for the first time -- about the tech concentration in the stock market after several years of outsize gains in the sector. As with market reaction to the tech backlash, this has little to do with the tech superpowers' current businesses, which remain solid. Nothing has changed. Except everything has changed.

And just as 7am crosses, Trump tells Russia via Twitter to \u201c get ready,\u201d because missiles are coming at Syria.  There wasn\u2019t a ton of news out otherwise besides further details over China President Xi\u2019s pledges, CNN reporting that Trump is considering firing Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, and a seemingly disappointing data point in the agriculture machinery space in Deere\u2019s monthly sales figures.  How\u2019d Zuck Do?  The early market gains from Xi\u2019s trade-war-soothing keynote held, for the most part, and accelerated once Zuckerberg took the stage at the first of two congressional hearings. The response was overwhelmingly positive to his cool, calm, and collected demeanor, as traders bid up Facebook (FB +4.5%) and the rest of the tech space (S5INFT +2.2%). Here\u2019s what the Street had to say about the performance:  Evercore ISI analyst Anthony DiClemente, who rates FB an outperform, said Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony was \"sometimes tedious, other times repetitive, but mostly -- and this is a good thing -- uneventful\"; he added that Zuckerberg delivered balanced and reasonable answers to questions and \"seemed to strike the right tone\" as he found plenty of common ground with the lawmakers; DiClemente saw little in the testimony that should negatively impact investors\u2019 view of Facebook\u2019s long-term growth and business opportunity  Suntrust analyst Youssef Squali, who rates FB a buy, said that while no major news emerged from the testimony, \"we believe that this is a seminal event, one that\u2019s likely to lead to increased regulation (a la GDPR)\" that should still favor larger platforms like FB and GOOGL in the end  Big Move, But Still Range Bound  Energy stocks had the best day of all (S5ENRS +3.3%, biggest upside move since Nov. 2016) thanks to a continuation of the rip in crude prices. The sector has been the big winner so far in April while the defensive sectors, like utilities and REITs, and the industrials (blame Brent oil\u2019s surge through $70/bbl for weakness in the airlines) have been clear laggards.  The market\u2019s move to the upside was on relatively decent volumes too. They were the second highest on the consolidated tape this month, and a major bounce back from Monday, where we saw the second lowest number all year.  We closed near the high end of the S&P\u2019s recent range, just shy of resistance at ~2,660 (while support still holds at the 200-day moving average of ~2,596) and we could see further optimism creep back into the market if we can break above this mark.  Excuses to Fade the Rally  But something we\u2019ve become accustomed to lately is these huge swings to the upside followed by swift plunges in the opposite direction, so it\u2019s altogether possible that investors will be looking for any excuse to fade yesterday\u2019s move.  Perhaps day two of Zuckerberg\u2019s grilling (scheduled for 10am) doesn\u2019t elicit the same response as day one, and the FAANGs, the semis, and the rest of tech fade hard -- Goldman is already out slashing estimates on chip darling NVDA and sell-rated AMD, with both stocks down ~1% in pre-market trading.  Maybe the latest headlines tied to Mueller, or the Cohen raid, or possible action in Syria will spill over into the market. Or perhaps a scorching hot CPI print (today at 8:30am), after yesterday\u2019s firmer-than-expected PPI, and some eyebrow-raising language in the FOMC Minutes (at 2pm) might help to spook the tape.  Watch the BKX for clues as we\u2019re only two days away from the kickoff to bank earnings. And as for tech\u2019s next major non-Facebook catalyst, it\u2019ll be NFLX\u2019s earnings on Monday after the close. The sell-side has been aggressively bumping up numbers over the past few days, so expectations are riding high: Morgan Stanley yesterday gave bull case $440 on higher conviction, Goldman today raised price target to $360 on a likely beat, and many others making similar tweaks to their models.

The social media company has lost 12 percent this week, its biggest two-day retreat since 2012, based on closing prices.  News that a company linked to President Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign may have collected data from Facebook users without permission sparked concern that the social media giant -- and potentially its peers -- could face increased regulatory scrutiny. Investors seem to be mostly shrugging off this concern, at least for now. Shares of Facebook have been under pressure for months amid concern over the company\u2019s role in Russian meddling in the 2016 election, even as its peers in the FANG Index of tech megacaps managed to withstand the pressure.  \u201cWhile the last two days were exceedingly harsh, the stock has been losing ground on a relative basis for quite some time,\u201d said Frank Cappelleri, senior equity trader at Instinet LLC. \u201cWhat if Facebook continues to struggle but the rest of the market can shrug it off? That\u2019s just a question to consider.\u201d  A Congressional official familiar with the matter said Facebook tentatively agreed to brief House Judiciary members as early as Wednesday over the use of Facebook users\u2019 personal data by Cambridge Analytica, a firm hired as a consultant to Trump\u2019s campaign.

At 18.4 percent, the measure of firms\u2019 long and short positioning was nearly 2 percentage points higher than for February.  Technology Overload Quant funds have boosted tech stock exposure 2 percentage points since start of year Source: Credit Suisse Services Risk Advisory  Quants on the Credit Suisse platform are roughly defined as funds that invest in thousands of equities and trade based on patterns, rather than making stock-specific bets.  It\u2019s mounting evidence that investors following some of the most popular quantitative strategies -- such as momentum investing -- are heavily concentrated in technology. Over the past year, chipmakers Micron Technology Inc. and Nvidia Corp. alone accounted for more than a tenth of gains in the Bloomberg pure U.S. momentum index, which tracks stocks that have gained the most over the past year.  Yet if quant investors had stepped in Wednesday programmed to expect dip-buying, they found no such luck. Following the funds\u2019 peak in technology exposure, the stocks fell about 5 percent to trade at the lowest in more than a month. For the week, global tech shares fell 7.3 percent.  On Monday, the stocks rallied back, with chipmakers among the biggest gainers in the S&P 500 Index.  As for fundamental managers, equity long-short hedge funds tracked by Credit Suisse maintained their elevated technology exposure, at about 22 percent of total holdings. Overall, equity managers appeared largely unmoved by last week\u2019s bout of selling, according to Mark Connors, the head of risk advisory at the Swiss bank.  \u201cStable equity gross and net positioning across most equity managers indicates recent volatility has not prompted unwinds at this point,\u201d Connors wrote in a Friday note. \u201cThe currently odd mix of hedge fund positioning reflects neither concern of further risk-off, nor longer-term optimism regarding global growth.\u201d", "stock": "NVDA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-26", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-26/quants-footprint-in-tech-hit-record-just-as-selloff-accelerated"}, {"article": "Investors in technology shares are concerned that the industry could be the next victim of the Trump administration\u2019s increasingly combative stance toward global trade partners.  While Donald Trump\u2019s broadsides this week against what he deemed unfair trade practices focused on industrial metals, comments he made over the past couple of months about the tech industry indicate it could soon come in for targeting as well. In January, Trump said the U.S. was considering a fine on China because it had forced U.S. companies to share their intellectual property as a cost of doing business there. Then in his first State of the Union address, Trump pledged \u201cstrong enforcement\u201d of U.S. rules that protect business secrets.  Those warnings are now sounding more ominous to investors concerned about a trade war between the world\u2019s two biggest economies.  Chris Krueger, an analyst at Cowen Washington Research, notes that semiconductors are one of six \u201ccore industries\u201d in Trump\u2019s America First agenda, along with steel, aluminum, vehicles, aircraft and shipbuilding. He said a U.S. Trade Representative report on forced technology transfers by China may come in a matter of weeks, way before the official Aug. 18 deadline, and could recommend tariffs or bans on Chinese investment or joint ventures.  If Trump does decide to crack down on intellectual property theft, U.S.-based semiconductor companies that have Chinese customers or factories in China could get caught in the crossfire. China is the largest market for the chip industry and if it were to retaliate some U.S. companies may suffer.  \u201cReciprocity on the part of China in IP crackdowns could have a substantial effect on manufacturing and IP of companies,\u201d said Matt Larson, a Bloomberg Intelligence litigation analyst.  One sector high-flier with significant China exposure, Nvidia Corp., had been up 25 percent year-to-date. It sold off as much as 5.7 percent yesterday after Trump made his steel tariff comments, and is dropped as far as 4.5 percent today before recovering. The move over the past two days is worse than the broader market selloff of about 2 percent, reflecting the concern about a Trump tech crackdown.

Quantitative investors have long used liquidity signals to strengthen their automated models. Simply put, bets on the least traded stocks should, in theory, outperform the market because there\u2019s a reward for taking on the extra liquidity risk.  But since December the opposite has been occurring, with the most liquid stocks rewarding investors to the greatest degree in nine years.  In normal times, heavily traded shares don\u2019t overlap much with momentum stocks. Reliable companies carry the market higher without any frenzied buying or selling. Amazon.com Inc., for example, has one of the lowest turnover ratios in the S&P 500 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Yet in a long-short Bloomberg index that bets on the most actively traded stocks, a hefty chipmaker presence has the gauge headed toward its best month since 2009. That semiconductor shares are rising so quickly despite a high turnover is an ominous signal, indicating that trigger-happy, short-term investors are wading into momentum, according to Vitali Kalesnik, head of equity research at Research Affiliates LLC.  Pure Panic  \u201cWhen you see very strong momentum combined with a sharp rise in trading volume, that can serve as a signal of overheating and speculative behavior,\u201d Kalesnik said by phone.\u201cThe issue with speculator money is they can come in and drive prices up and once they see signs of something happening, they quickly leave and drag prices down.\u201d  Nvidia Corp., VMware Inc. and Micron Technology Inc. hold the biggest positions in the Bloomberg trade activity portfolio, and have gained as much as 22 percent in January alone. But the potential for sharp reversals was put on display Wednesday, when semiconductor stocks in the S&P 500 tumbled 2.4 percent, the most in seven weeks, on the heels of a disappointing earnings report from Texas Instruments Inc.  The only other instances of liquid share outperformance occurred when equities began to recover from the bear market lows in 2002 and 2009. But the difference is that in those periods this was a healthy sign because the most beaten up shares had been oversold during the downturn, enabling them to outperform off those lows when the market rebounded, according to Joseph Mezrich, head of U.S. quantitative analysis at Nomura Instinet LLC.  This time, gains in the most liquid shares are pointing to pure panic, he said.  \u201cWhat you\u2019re observing is a panicked market,\u201d Mezrich said. \u201cYou have people panicking to get into these stocks because of a fear of missing out.

Meanwhile, Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro made it clear that there are no country exemptions to the tariffs, even for U.S. allies like Canada and Great Britain.  Major company-specific news from the weekend include a wrench thrown into Broadcom\u2019s $117 billion bid for Qualcomm (CFIUS issuing an order to delay tomorrow\u2019s vote) and reinsurer M&A with France\u2019s Axa buying XL Group for more than $15 billion, the largest-ever European acquisition of a U.S. insurer.  The market\u2019s focus has shifted quickly from inflation fears, and what the Fed is going to do about it, to the potential for an all-out trade war, and whether the threat from Trump is real or if he is testing the waters to gauge sentiment. The market will be paying close attention over the next few days to retaliatory efforts from the rest of the world, as well as Trump\u2019s next steps: Will he lob more insults at our trade partners? Will he ratchet up the call to exit Nafta (as talks come to a close tomorrow)? Will he clarify or walk the stiff tariff levels back?  Until now, stocks haven\u2019t felt too much of an impact from the recent noise out of D.C., of which there has been plenty over the past week or so. For example, the confusion over what to do about gun control, Lindsay Graham calling for a war with North Korea, Jared Kushner losing top security clearance, Hope Hicks resigning, The Mooch getting banned, and swirling speculation of key point people in the administration taking their leave, from Gary Cohn and H.R. McMaster to John Kelly and Jeff Sessions.  But given the recent shock from the tariff announcement as well as how the calendar is shaping up (we won\u2019t get a major inflationary datapoint until Friday\u2019s jobs & wage hike data), we should expect traders to pay much closer attention to the headlines coming out of the Trump administration in the near term. This is especially true if the rumors get louder about someone like Cohn throwing in the towel.  Scenario #1: Trump Escalates Trade War Fears  Here is what could happen if Trump doesn\u2019t back down on his tariff call (25% on imported steel, 10% on foreign aluminum) and keeps the potential for a trade war very broad by targeting the entire world instead of singling out a country like China:  Steel and aluminum stocks resume their vicious rally from last Thursday, when Trump shockingly introduced the tariffs: CLF surged 10%, AKS +9.5%, CENX +7.5%, X +5.8%, STLD +4%, and so on  NAFTA-exposed names take it further on the chin as the market turns sour on the prospects for a renegotiated pact; this would include the rails (especially KSU and the Canadians like CNI and CP), the autos (GM, FCAU, etc) and the auto parts companies (like MGA and LEA)  Semiconductors with exposure to China (NVDA, MU, AMD, INTC) could come under further pressure given read-across to some of Trump\u2019s past comments on the tech industry and whether he may decide to crack down on alleged intellectual property theft  Watch for rotation into small caps (Russell 2000 clear outperformer in past two sessions) and sectors that are more insulated to a potential trade war like biotechs (IBB ETF up 2.4% on Friday) and the banks  Focus on single-name stocks that have low exposure to a trade war; on Friday, Fundstrat\u2019s Tom Lee put out a bullish buy-the-dip note on equities where he listed 20 stocks that fit the bill given low export as percent of sales and low international sourcing as percent of COGS; included HSY, MSI, and a bunch of energy and healthcare names like EOG, HES, PXD, ALXN, AMGN, BIIB, and GILD  And some will just stick with what has worked, for example NFLX (which rose 5.3% last week to completely shrug off any weakness in FAANG or the SPX) and AMZN (which was flat last week); these two are up 57% and 28% year-to-date, respectively  Scenario #2: Trade War Fears Are Scaled Back  Here\u2019s what might happen if Trump caves in from all of the negativity surrounding the tariff announcement and walks back some of his comments from last week:  We\u2019ll likely see a reversal in some of the actions mentioned above, for example the metal stocks pare some of their tariff-fueled gains while the Nafta names, especially the autos, catch a relief rally  Expect strength in names that got hit late last week on speculation of how the tariffs might crimp margins, for instance heavy machinery like CAT, DE, TEX, MTW and truck machinery like CMI and PCAR Sidenote: Truck machinery names got some good news late Friday night after preliminary Class 8 data for February showed elevated demand (positive for CMI, PCAR, and NAV)  May also see outperformance in HOG, which got caught in the crossfire of potential retaliation from the EU  Tick-by-Tick Guide to Today\u2019s Actionable Events", "stock": "NVDA", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-05", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-05/here-s-how-to-trade-trump-s-next-trade-war-tweet-taking-stock"}, {"article": "There's no U.S. firm more at risk from trade retaliation.  There's no U.S. firm more at risk from trade retaliation.  If there's a poster child for the tonic the current U.S. government has delivered to the country's corporate sector, it's Boeing Co.  Fueled by Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg's cozy relationship with President Donald Trump, orders for Super Hornet fighter jets and corporate tax cuts, its 146 percent share-price increase since election day in 2016 has outpaced every other company on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.    Thursday's 3.5 percent fall after Trump tweeted out plans to impose tariffs on metal imports should be a warning sign that, beyond the current clear skies, a storm is building.  One obvious risk is increased costs. About 80 percent of an aircraft's weight is aluminum, and Trump's promise to slap levies of 10 percent on imports of that metal represents a pricing handicap in Muilenburg's endless battle for market share with Airbus SE.  Flying High Boeing has put in by far the best share-price performance of any company on the Dow since Trump's election Source: Bloomberg  At the same time, that blow is likely to be cushioned by the fact that managing raw-materials costs is part and parcel of being a manufacturer. Aluminum prices have risen or fallen by 10 percent or more in all but eight of the past 30 years. Boeing, moreover, isn't a major buyer of aluminum straight from the pot: Most of its supply comes from Arconic Inc., the specialty-products half of the old Alcoa Corp. business. Shares of Arconic slipped 1.5 percent on Thursday, an indication it's expected to take part of the hit.  The bigger risk depends on how the coming days and months are handled.  There's probably no U.S. firm more at risk of trade retaliation from China than Boeing. Of the 10 American businesses that declare more than $5 billion of sales in the country, three -- Apple Inc., Las Vegas Sands Corp. and Procter & Gamble Co. -- are dependent on consumer spending, so probably somewhat immune to government diktats. Six more are in the semiconductor and tech businesses that China wants to encourage domestically, so they should also enjoy a degree of protection. Against that backdrop, Boeing stands out like a sore thumb.  Odd One Out Boeing is the only non-consumer, non-tech U.S. company that declares more than $5 billion in revenue from China Source: Bloomberg  Most of its biggest customers in China are state-owned airlines and lessors affiliated with government-controlled banks. The few independent players could easily be leaned on by authorities to defer existing orders.  China Inc. has a sound self-interested rationale for pursuing an aggressive path. Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China Ltd., or Comac, is hoping to pitch its C919 jet as a home-grown competitor to Boeing's 737 and Airbus's A320, and announced last month it would make its first delivery in 2021.  Using a trade war to put one of the C919's rivals on the back foot seems the perfect way to crack open the Boeing-Airbus duopoly and advance the interests of China's own manufacturers. Should the current tit-for-tat over steel and aluminum spiral toward a trade war, few firms will find themselves in a more precarious position than Boeing.

The company, which specializes in systems that analyze faces and images on an enormous scale, said it closed a Series C round in recent months in which Singaporean state investment firm Temasek Holdings Pte and retailer Suning.com Co. also participated. SenseTime didn\u2019t outline individual investments, but Alibaba was said to have sought the biggest stake in the three-year-old startup.  With the deal, SenseTime has doubled its valuation in a few months. Backed by Qualcomm Inc., it underscores its status as one of a crop of homegrown firms spearheading Beijing\u2019s ambition to become the leader in AI by 2030. And it\u2019s a contributor to the world\u2019s biggest system of surveillance: if you\u2019ve ever been photographed with a Chinese-made phone or walked the streets of a Chinese city, chances are your face has been digitally crunched by SenseTime software built into more than 100 million mobile devices.  The latest financing will bankroll investments in parallel fields such as autonomous driving and augmented reality, cover the growing cost of AI talent and shore up its computing power. It\u2019s developing a service code-named \u201cViper\u201d to parse data from thousands of live camera feeds -- a platform it hopes will prove invaluable in mass surveillance. And it\u2019s already in talks to raise another round of funds and targeting a valuation of more than $4.5 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.  \u201cWe\u2019re going to explore several new strategic directions and that\u2019s why we shall spend more money on building infrastructure,\u201d SenseTime co-founder Xu Li said in an interview.

SenseTime plans to build at least five supercomputers in top-tier cities over the coming year to drive Viper and other services. As envisioned, it streams thousands of live feeds into a single system that\u2019re automatically processed and tagged, via devices from office face-scanners to ATMs and traffic cameras (so long as the resolution is high enough). The ultimate goal is to juggle 100,000 feeds simultaneously.  Police can use Viper to track everything from vice and accidents to suspects on blacklists. While civil libertarians say such systems have been used to track activists and oppress minorities in places like the Western region of Xinjiang, Xu believes the technology is essential and deployed in various ways by authorities around the world. China\u2019s police forces and surveillance footage are also important sources of training data for SenseTime\u2019s image recognition systems -- it claims to work with 40 city authorities in the country.  \u201cIt will not affect privacy because only authorized persons can access it,\u201d he said.  SenseTime claims some 400 clients and partners including Qualcomm, chipmaker Nvidia Corp. and smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp. For 2018, it\u2019s projecting several billion yuan in revenues, Xu said. The startup\u2019s expanding its reach across augmented reality, popularized by services like Snapchat that impose digital stickers and images on the real world. And it\u2019s working with Honda Motor Co. to develop autonomous driving systems and is in talks to work with health institutions.  \u201cIn China there is an advantage in areas like facial recognition because of the privacy that exists in the U.S. and elsewhere in the EU, and some of the very best facial recognition technology in the world that I\u2019ve seen is in China,\u201d said Breyer Capital founder Jim Breyer, an indirect investor in SenseTime through IDG.  SenseTime is the largest, according to CB Insights, of a plethora of private AI outfits. Fellow facial-recognition startup Megvii Inc. raised $460 million last year, while smaller niche players from Yitu to Malong Technologies have also won funding. A key partner, Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology, is one of the world\u2019s biggest suppliers of security cameras and developing its own competing AI technology.  Xu says its ability to work across wide datasets and diverse products sets it apart from rivals. \u201cWhat is difficult is if you\u2019re dealing with different video streams in different formats,\u201d he said.

The company will likely beat earnings expectations because of the cryptocurrency boost, but investors will be looking for a big beat to move shares higher.  Watch Nvidia trade in real time here.    Cryptocurrencies have provided Nvidia, and other chipmakers, with a big boost to their top line in recent quarters.  Crypto miners have been buying up huge swaths of GPUs as the prices of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies skyrocketed. The huge demand drained Nvidia's supply chains and sent the prices of the cards soaring in secondary markets. All of this extra demand is estimated to have boosted Nvidia's revenue in the fourth quarter, but that leaves Nvidia with a big problem as it looks to report earnings on Thursday.  \"We think the Company will need to see material Outperformance to see appreciation on the print (largely due to near-term run-up),\" Mitch Steves, an analyst at RBC, said in a note to clients on Tuesday.  Steves is saying that the extra demand for GPUs has sent shares of Nvidia higher recently, which will make it hard for the company to impress investors when it reports fourth-quarter earnings. The company can't just report overall revenue growth, it will have to show that it's growing revenue outside of its graphics division because the boost from crypto could eventually disappear as prices of cryptocurrencies fluctuate and interest wanes.  AMD, Nvidia's main rival in the GPU space, saw its shares plummet about 6% immediately after reporting an across-the-board beat on earnings. AMD said it got a 5-6% boost in annual revenue in 2017, and said about 1/3 of its growth in its graphics and computing division was from increased GPU demand from cryptocurrencies, which wasn't enough for investors watching the earnings. Shares of AMD did rebound though, and the company is up 4.08% this year.  Because of the recent runs higher, some analysts have dialed back their enthusiasm for the stock. Citron Research and Goldman Sachs both recently expressed concerns over how much Nvidia has risen over the past year because of enthusiasm around crypto demand, leading Citron to lower its price target and Goldman to remove the stock from its conviction list. Both firms are still bullish on Nvidia in the long term.  Steves thinks new data center chips will revitalize growth in that unit. Nvidia is also working on more partnerships for its autonomous driving chips that should improve sales as more automakers release cars with self-driving capabilities, even if they are initially limited. These two units are potential growth areas that Nvidia could highlight in its earnings to show it's not just a crypto mining company.

Shares of Nvidia were up just over 1% in early trading Wednesday as the company's GPU Technology Conference \u2014 one of the most highly anticipated artificial intelligence events of the year \u2014 kicks off in San Jose, California.  CEO Jensen Huang is scheduled to take the stage at 9am Pacific Time (12 pm Eastern) to deliver a keynote address to the conference's expected 8,000 developers from over 50 countries, the company says.  He is expected to touch on many of the company's key drivers, including automotive, data centers, and gaming. Gaming has recently come into the spotlight for Nvidia, as its chips were being gobbled up like crazy at the height of the crypto craze during the end of 2017 and early 2018. Cryptocurrency miners made it nearly impossible for people to find the crucial components for PC gaming.  \"We expect a very upbeat tone from the company, particularly in light of the truly solid string of results the company has continued to deliver,\" BMO Capital Markets analyst Ambush Srivastava said in a note to clients on Monday ahead of the conference.  \"Among the areas highlighted, we see a particular emphasis on the inferencing market in AI, updates to the architecture for gaming, and on new developments such as ray-tracing for gaming.\"  BMO has a target price of $225 for shares of Nvidia \u2014 roughly 9% below the stock's opening price of $247 Tuesday, and well below Wall Street's average target of $250.  The conference is also a chance for over 20 startups to show off their products to potential investors, including Nvidia itself.  MIT estimated last year that Nvidia has spent around $3 billion of its own money on research and development, but it's also investing in smaller companies and startups working on AI applications.  In an interview with Markets Insider last year, Jeff Herbst, Vice President of Business Development for Nvidia, explained that the company's portfolio was in \"early innings,\" but has invested in more than 20 companies focused on everything from self-driving cars, to GPU-powered deep learning and more.

The stock is down 1.52% to $236.84 after Goldman Sachs removed Nvidia from its conviction list, and Citron said the stock is about to drop about 15% to $200.  The two firms are both concerned about how red-hot Nvidia shares have been recently. Shares have been on a meteoric tear over the last year, gaining 104.31%, as revenues grew just 11%. In 2018, stock has posted a 16.74% gain, which Citron thinks is too much.  \"Is Nvidia really worth $36 billion more than it was New Years Eve with $15k BTC?\" Citron asked on Twitter. Nvidia has gotten a boost from cryptocurrency miners buying huge numbers of graphics cards to speed up their rigs, especially as the price of bitcoin hit its high of nearly $20,000 in December. Prices have come crashing down to just under $9,000, which could mean demand from miners could wane.  Citron and Goldman both fear the boost Nvidia has seen from cryptocurrency mining is unsustainable and unreliable as a way to grow sales. Goldman said it could lead to volatile earnings as Wall Street struggles to find concrete ways to predict the demand of the crypto market.  For context, during its recent earnings call, AMD's leadership said crypto mining added about $300 million in revenue, or about 5-6%, in 2017. Nvidia is set to report its earnings, and its boost from crypto mining, on February 8.  Crypto isn't the only worry for Nvidia, though.  The company's data center business was just starting when Goldman added the stock to its conviction list in late 2016. Since then, it's exploded as artificial intelligence and cloud computing have become the hottest new trend in enterprise computing. The sector is now better understood, which means more players are starting to nip at the heels of Nvidia's dominance, according to Citron.  Citron said that Nvidia used to be the only player in AI and autonomous driving computing, but is facing stiff competition in both categories going into 2018.  While both Goldman and Citron criticize the company and predict a more difficult 2018, the firms agree that Nvidia is still at the top of its game.

The system designed for use by its partners is called Drive Constellation, and involves using two different servers to accurately simulate real-world autonomous driving in a totally virtualized enviroment. One server runs Nvidia\u2019s Drive Sim software, which will simulate an automated vehicles sensory experience while out on the road, providing photorealistic camera captures and data from virtualized LiDAR and radar systems that accurately mimics what would be captured driving on a real road.  The second server in the system is running an Nvidia Drive Pegasus AI, or the \u2018brain\u2019 of an autonomous vehicle, which processes the data fed from the first server just as it would if it was real data being fed from vehicles sensors capturing it from the road. The Pegasus-powered server then returns its control commands back to the simulator, telling it to carry out driving activity just as it would a real car on the road.  This is what Nvidia terms a \u201chardware-in-the-loop\u201d cycle, and it can run at 30 such exchanges per second, helping to validate autonomous driving software performance. And because it can be fully controlled by the tester, the Drive Sim part of the equation can be tuned to provide a realistic driving experience like one might encounter on roads, or artificial conditions like enduring 24 hours of blinding, peak mid-day sun \u2013 or whatever edge case a researcher or developer might want to test and optimize for.  Edge cases remain the primary concern for anyone developing autonomous cars, and the issue with relying on real-world testing to build software that can properly handle these edge cases is that they don\u2019t occur often, and they\u2019re seldom replicable.

Alexis Campbell, a community relations manager for Pennsylvania\u2019s Department of Transportation, said it would work with Uber to ensure that safety was the top priority if tested was restarted in the state.

In 2016, Uber started testing its self-driving cars in San Francisco without a permit, arguing that one wasn\u2019t necessary because a safety driver was monitoring the vehicles.  The D.M.V. disagreed and ordered Uber to apply for a permit. When Uber refused, the department revoked the registrations for the 16 cars that Uber was testing in the city.  After California revoked the registrations, Mr. Ducey said Arizona welcomed Uber\u2019s cars with \u201copen arms and wide open roads.\u201d In a public showing, Uber loaded its cars onto a truck and hauled them to Arizona.

And as we\u2019ve seen after previous fervors, investors can take a long time to regain their faith.  Facebook is down 20 percent from its recent high. Most of the slide came after news reports showing how the company\u2019s data was misused. Investors have to grapple with the possibility that Facebook won\u2019t be sharing as much data as it does, undermining its ability to generate ever-increasing amounts of advertising revenue.  Nvidia, a computer chip maker intent on being a leader in automated driving technology, is off 12 percent from its recent high. The company said on Tuesday that it would halt tests of its autonomous driving technology on public roads after an Uber self-driving car hit and killed a pedestrian in Arizona.  Tesla is not a tech stock, but it is included in the FANG+ index, and its supporters believe deeply in its power to revolutionize the auto industry. Growing fears about Tesla\u2019s ability to finance its expansion have helped drag its stock down 33 percent from its recent high. Ominously, the price of Tesla\u2019s bonds is also falling, signaling that the company is losing the confidence of creditors.  Of course, on their march higher, tech stocks overcame obstacles, like management problems at Uber and the poor performance of Snap\u2019s initial public offering.  But the latest problems have raised deeper, broader doubts, and that may keep the uncertainty around longer. Investors have viewed automated driving technology as a huge potential source of growth for some companies. But after the Uber incident in Arizona, those companies may take a more realistic look at what they have to spend to create a technology that is efficient and safe, and conclude that they have to pull out of the race or pare back. Users of social media and regulators may prevent social media companies from sharing so much of their data with advertisers, and that could restrain revenue growth.  And if the passion for two or three big tech companies wanes, the cooling may spread.  \u2014 Peter Eavis  Amazon has shed more than $50 billion in market value.  The reason?

Jonathan Swan of Axios, citing anonymous sources, reported:  \u201cTrump has talked about changing Amazon\u2019s tax treatment because he\u2019s worried about mom-and-pop retailers being put out of business.\u201d  Mr. Swan added:  \u201cTrump\u2019s wealthy friends tell him Amazon is destroying their businesses. His real estate buddies tell him \u2014 and he agrees \u2014 that Amazon is killing shopping malls and brick-and-mortar retailers.\u201d  Shares of Amazon have tumbled more than 7 percent at one point Wednesday, but they pared those losses after a White House official told Reuters there were no specific policy changes related to Amazon being considered at the moment. But the official added that the administration is always looking at different options on a range of policy issues.  How concerned should investors be?  GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives writes:  \u201cWhile it\u2019s now a hand holding time for Amazon given this new regulatory potential threat, we believe the reality of these worries altering the company\u2019s business model and future tax structure are low and we would be buyers of the name on weakness.\u201d  Guess which companies are benefiting from Amazon's woes? Retailers, the FT points out.  On a day when the stocks on Wall Street are flat, Macy\u2019s was up 3.5 percent, J.C. Penney has gained 5.5 percent, Walmart rose 1.7 percent, Target increased 1.8 percent, and Kohl\u2019s was up 2.4 percent.  Photo  Are investors waking up to Tesla\u2019s real problem?  The electric carmaker\u2019s shares are down 7 percent Wednesday, after plunging 8 percent on Tuesday.  Tuesday\u2019s slide was driven, in part, by the National Transportation Safety Board\u2019s announcement that it was investigating a fatal crash last week involving a Tesla vehicle in California. News that Jaguar Land Rover was teaming up with Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Waymo unit probably didn't help either.  But the continued decline in Tesla\u2019s stock \u2014 its shares are down more than 20 percent since mid-March \u2014 speaks to the bigger concern surrounding Tesla: How it funds itself.  Investors have grown increasingly worried as Tesla burns through cash and struggles to meet its own production goals for the Model 3. Late Tuesday, Moody\u2019s downgraded Tesla\u2019s credit rating further into junk territory and said its outlook on the company is negative. The credit ratings agency cited production delays and said Tesla may soon need to raise more than $2 billion.  Those concerns can be seen not just in Tesla\u2019s stock price but also in the trading of its debt. The FT points out that \u201cTesla\u2019s eight-year bond maturing in 2025 traded on Wednesday at 87.6 cents to the dollar, the lowest since issuance. The yield has surged to 7.5 percent from 6.59 percent on Monday.\u201d  Liam Denning of Bloomberg Gadfly writes:  \u201cChallenges on the factory floor and the balance sheet are converging. Drawing inexorably closer to a refinancing wall, Tesla needs a real shot of confidence, and capital, to keep its money machine turning over this year. \u201cGiven Tuesday\u2019s bond blowout, that almost certainly means tapping the equity market again.

But with Mr. Trump preparing to meet with North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un \u2014 who just took an armored train trip to Beijing \u2014 and the North apparently pressing on with nuclear developments, an \u201cAmerica first\u201d trade stance was far from the only thing pushing the South to sign. More from Michael D. Shear and Alan Rappeport:  The political success of the trade agreement \u2014 and its ability to be replicated in other negotiations \u2014 is not guaranteed. Many countries have reacted coolly to Washington\u2019s pugilistic approach to trade, viewing the president\u2019s preference to punch first and negotiate later as counter to global interests.  The Trump administration continues to ramp up its trade rhetoric with China. Unidentified sources told Bloomberg that it is considering invoking an emergency law to restrict Chinese investments in sensitive U.S. tech. A separate plan to enact tariffs on $60 billion of Chinese goods has left companies wondering which industries will be targeted. Other Asian countries increasingly fear being caught in the crossfire of a trade war, the WSJ reports.

Like, seriously.  Right now, in 2018, there are three architectures (that\u2019s right, three) competing to be the GeForce GTX 11 series of GPUs between Volta, Ampere and Turing. And, right now, we\u2019d have to put our money on Turing being the follow-up to the wildly successful, Pascal-based GeForce GTX 10 series graphics cards. We were kind of hoping Nvidia would reveal the identity of the architecture behind the GeForce GTX 11 series would be at GTC, but all we got was some AI and autonomous car information.  Similar to previous generational leaps, like Maxwell to Pascal, we\u2019re expecting the Nvidia GeForce GTX 11 series GPUs to bring efficiency, and maybe PC gaming as a whole, to an entirely new level with true 4K, 60 frames-per-second gaming powered by a single GPU.  Cut to the chase  What is it? Nvidia\u2019s next generation graphics cards for gamers  Nvidia\u2019s next generation graphics cards for gamers When is it out? Rumored for July 2018  Rumored for July 2018 What will it cost? Hopefully not much more than Pascal  Based on the latest reports from Tom\u2019s Hardware, which cited \u2018multiple independent sources\u2019 in the industry, we won\u2019t see Nvidia\u2019s next-generation graphics card release until July or later this year. Word on the Internet streets suggests that mass production of new GeForce cards won\u2019t begin until mid-June, so an earlier launch date seems unlikely.  If these rumors are true, the closest and biggest venue for Nvidia to make its big announcement would be Gamescom in August. That said, we haven\u2019t heard any more corroborating reports to suggest Tom\u2019s Hardware\u2019s information is correct.  Earlier reports from Tweaktown and Reuters suggested a Nvidia Turing announcement at the Game Developer\u2019s Conference or GTC 2018. Following that, cards were expected to be available as soon as April or May.  Although that timing would make sense, given the release date of the current line of Pascal cards in May 2016, as the year goes on it's looking more unlikely. And, now that GTC has come and gone with no mention of the next line of GeForce GPUs, it might be a while before Nvidia unveils its next line of GPUs.  Nvidia Turing price  Given the current state of GPU prices in a cryptocurrency-crazed world, we can\u2019t but help to predict higher prices for graphics cards in the near future. Especially given that the Pascal graphics cards came at a slightly higher premium over the last-generation Maxwell cards they replaced.  With that all in mind, we wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see the price of Turing GPUs take a slight uptick over these following Founders Cards that are currently available:  Nvidia Turing specs  Given that the firm has already introduced its new 12-nanometer manufacturing process with Nvidia Volta, we fully expect that it will trickle down to the company\u2019s likely consumer-facing Turing GPU line. Beyond that, though, there aren\u2019t too many confirmed details or conclusions we can make about the specs surrounding Nvidia\u2019s next line of graphics cards.  For one thing, reports are still debating whether the successor to the Nvidia GTX 1080 will be given a GTX 1180 or GTX 2080 model naming convention. Then there\u2019s the question of whether Turing will employ GDDR6 video memory or HBM2, as seen on the Nvidia Titan V .  For now, we\u2019ll have to sit and wait for more concrete leaks and rumors before we can begin to even speculate as to how well-equipped Nvidia Turing graphics cards will be.  Whatever the case, we fully expect Nvidia to deliver with new GPU technology that pushes the envelope for PC gaming as it always has.", "stock": "NVDA", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-08", "source": "techradar", "url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/nvidia-turing"}, {"article": "Ask any console gamer, and they\u2019ll likely tell you about the perennial rivalry between the Xbox One and PS4. However, PC gamers have their own internal feud, albeit without the headlines: Nvidia vs AMD. Don\u2019t be fooled \u2013 it\u2019s a good thing. The sheer amount of innovation and competition springing from this tech feud is nothing short of amazing. Still, if you\u2019re not willing to pledge loyalty to one of these tech behemoths, it can be hard to decide what the best graphics card for your needs is.  Don\u2019t worry though, we here at TechRadar have decided to sit down and figure out once and for all the true winner in the battle of Nvidia vs AMD. (Spoiler: it never ends)  In 2018, Nvidia and AMD are still at each other's\u2019 throats. It\u2019s been almost two years since Nvidia launched its GeForce 10 series, and while it\u2019s likely Nvidia will replace its Pascal architecture with either Volta or Turing in 2018, it doesn\u2019t really need to. Following the launch of the GeForce GTX 1070 Ti, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told us not to expect a new generation of Nvidia GPUs until late 2018 at least. Still, with the Nvidia Titan V, we did get a sneak peek at what the future may look like.  And we\u2019ve also started to hear rumblings about the Nvidia Volta line of GPUs, so be sure to stay tuned for more updates.  Over on the red side, AMD has recently released its AMD Vega line of graphics cards. Existing as the much-anticipated successor to the flawed Polaris architecture, AMD\u2019s newest line of GPUs have only recently come out in August 2017. AMD has also come out with some driver updates that are meant to boost performance in many popular esports.  No matter how you slice it, neither Nvidia or AMD are going away any time soon, so that\u2019s why we created this guide \u2013 to dive in and figure out precisely how they differ. From their exclusive features to price-to-performance ratio, even down to their drivers. And you can\u2019t forget all of those pesky exclusivity deals, either.  There are graphics card choices for days  Price  Anyone who browses Reddit or comment sections on tech websites will tell you that AMD is widely known for its affordability, and Nvidia for its high-end performance and high prices. But, are they actually right?  Well, there are plenty of benchmarks that pretty convincingly tell us that the AMD Radeon RX Vega 56, which is available for around $1,200 on Amazon (about \u00a3860, AU$1,539) at the time of writing, is a better performer than the $650 (about \u00a3549, AU$799) Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070. When you factor in the effect that cryptocurrency mining has on the prices, Nvidia actually has a pretty massive advantage from a pricing perspective.  And, assuming that the rumors that Nvidia is planning on releasing cards that are aimed exclusively at cryptocurrency miners is true, we could start seeing prices fall for gaming-focused cards. But we wouldn\u2019t exactly keep our hopes up for that.  Go higher, and you\u2019ll find that the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 is most comparable to the AMD Radeon Vega 64. At an MSRP (manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail price) level, both of these cost about the same. This is, of course, intentional on both companies\u2019 parts.  After revealing its 4K-focused GTX 1080 Ti earlier this year, the Green Team was keen on dropping the price of the 1080 in the process. So, that card went from an MSRP of $599 down to $499 in the US, even though you\u2019ll still likely find it for around $1,400 (\u00a3830, AU$1,299). Before long, AMD was putting the Vega 64 onto store shelves at the same price.  Among basically every sector of the market Nvidia and AMd graphics cards cost about the same when you take price-to-performance in mind. The best graphics card overall, the GTX 1060, is identical in price to the AMD Radeon RX 580, and for budget cards, the RX 560 is the exact same price as a GTX 1050.  At the end of the day, the better price is going to depend on where you\u2019re lucky enough to find a discount. However, because of the boom in popularity of cryptocurrencies, the discounts are going to be few and far between, even if Nvidia says it wants to get more cards in the hands of gamers.  Performance  When you\u2019re trying to build a PC that\u2019s more powerful than your arch-enemy\u2019s, buying a graphics card isn\u2019t a matter of price but performance. Packing the best performance for the lowest cost is the arguably the most pertinent factor in driving GPU sales.  It used to be that AMD fans praised the Red Team for being the clear champions of value, but these days it\u2019s not so simple. Due to cryptocurrency and its effect on the GPU market, right now Nvidia are the clear winners when it comes to price-to-performance ratio. And as further proof that Nvidia is killing the game right now: AMD hasn\u2019t even produced a true contender to the GTX 1080Ti.  To be fair, Vega has only been available for a few months now, and there was no GTX 1080 Ti equivalent at Pascal\u2019s launch either. Still, the GTX 1080 shows the RX Vega 64 up in several different areas, such as multi-rendering and NBody calculation, whereas the RX Vega 64 is better at rendering texture details and complex shading.  In other words, AMD and Nvidia are so close at this point that which is better is more of a matter of what games you play and at what resolution. As we reported back in October, the Vega 64 is a better match for Forza Motorsport 7 at 1080p. At the same time, Nvidia\u2019s flagship GPU managed the frame rate advantage in 4K.  This trend continues down the list of cheaper graphics cards from AMD and Nvidia, including the RX Vega 56, which sees higher frame rates than the GTX 1070 Founders Edition in DirectX 12-heavy games like Rise of the Tomb Raider and Deus Ex: Mankind Divided (91 fps vs 89 fps and 40 fps vs 31 fps, respectively), according to PCGamesN.  And now that we\u2019ve seen reports that the next generation of Nvidia GeForce cards may be using GDDR6 memory, delivering double the speed of GDDR5, we could see a major upset happening in the coming months.  Throw a Grand Theft Auto V into the mix, however, and we\u2019re talking 64 fps on the RX Vega 56 vs 79 fps from the GTX 1070.  Software, drivers and features  One key draw to using Nvidia hardware over AMD is the Green Team\u2019s GeForce Experience software.  Because it delivers driver updates and optimizes games in addition to letting you broadcast gameplay and capture screenshots as well as videos directly from its easy-to-use interface, Nvidia GeForce Experience is posited as the one PC gaming application to rule them all.  Meanwhile, AMD\u2019s newly announced Radeon Software Adrenalin Edition aims to overtake Nvidia\u2019s solution.. Previously known as Crimson ReLive, the latest re-skinned update of AMD\u2019s graphics application is stacked with all of the features you\u2019ve grown accustomed to since the UI was massively overhauled back in July, but with the benefit of more consistent updates driver updates to account for every major game release.  As of December 2016, you could already livestream via Radeon Crimson ReLive, but now you can take safety measures to ensure maximum power efficiency while you\u2019re gaming. That includes the ability to underclock memory frequencies, cap frame rates on a hardware level and enable \u201cEnhanced Sync\u201d to decrease frame stutter while it simultaneously combats screen tearing.  Still, GeForce Experience has the game optimization features we\u2019re all crazy for. So when you don\u2019t know what settings are best for your computer in The Witcher 3, Nvidia takes care of the heavy lifting for you.  AMD users can download and install Raptr\u2019s Gaming Evolved tool to optimize their gaming experience. However, the add-on is less than ideal considering its biggest rival\u2019s audience can accomplish nearly everything from within GeForce Experience. That includes using Nvidia Ansel to take way cool in-game photos at resolutions exceeding 63K (16 times that of which a 4K monitor can display).  Nvidia also has a leg up when it comes to streaming games whether it\u2019s to another gaming PC with at least a Maxwell-based GPU, as well as the company\u2019s self-made tablets and set-top box. Not to mention, Nvidia also has a cloud-based gaming service call GeForce Now available to Windows 10 and MacOS users.  Exclusivity  It was once rumored that AMD and Nvidia were enacting shady tactics, \u201cpaying off\u201d game developers to show preferential treatment towards one or the other. Were this the case, it would certainly explain why certain games run better using GeForce graphics than Radeon and vice versa.  Fortunately, we don\u2019t see these concerns from PC gamers as much anymore, but that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t exist.  Following its Capsaicin & Cream livestream event at GDC 2017, we spoke with AMD its to discuss its strategy in contending with Nvidia. The news that the company would partner with Bethesda Softworks to optimize its games for Radeon, Ryzen or both was worrying to say the least. And it still is.  At the time, the potential for games operating more smoothly on AMD systems meant that Nvidia could fight back by partnering with an equally large publisher. Although the latter maneuver hasn\u2019t happened yet, early Wolfenstein II performance comparisons, such as this one from TechEpiphany on YouTube have exhibited better performance and lower temps coming from the AMD Radeon RX 64 when pitted against Nvidia\u2019s GeForce GTX 1080.  We\u2019re not saying there\u2019s a bias towards AMD in Bethesda\u2019s technical design decisions, however we aren\u2019t ready to take off our tin foil hats quite yet either.  Of course, Bethesda is hardly the only company to show favoritism to either team red or green. If you ever see an AMD or Nvidia splash screen ahead of the title page when you start a game, you can bet it will run better with that company\u2019s hardware.  So, which is better? Neither  There\u2019s so much to love, and in some instances \u201cdis-love,\u201d about both Nvidia and AMD graphics. In the end, both of these companies rely on competition with each other to thrive. Suffice to say, the Nvidia vs AMD debate requires that you understand there\u2019s a reason Radeon and GeForce GPUs are so similar in performance right now.  Each company is doing its best to keep up with the mindshare of the other, and that\u2019s good for us. They\u2019re basically fighting for our money, learning from each other\u2019s mistakes and legislating marked improvements along the way.  It\u2019s up to you who wins the fiery contest of Nvidia vs AMD, although we will say this: Nvidia is unmatched in the 4K market right now. If it helps any, the GTX 1080 Ti is your best bet if you want your PC to keep up with the likes of your Ultra HD display. Otherwise, Nvidia and AMD graphics cards are about the same, at least for the time being.", "stock": "NVDA", "label": 1, "date": "2018-04-09", "source": "techradar", "url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/computing-components/graphics-cards/amd-vs-nvidia-who-makes-the-best-graphics-cards-699480"}, {"article": "As cryptocurrency miners once again push the prices of graphics cards up \u2013 and even drive some GPUs out of stock \u2013 Nvidia has issued a statement in support of gamers struggling to find a card, and has made a move to try and help them.  Nvidia is asking retailers to sell a maximum of two graphics cards (of the same model) per person, in an effort to cut back on bulk orders from virtual currency miners.  Nvidia also issued a statement stressing that it\u2019s behind gamers when it comes to the current GPU stock and pricing problems. In a comment to German tech site ComputerBase, the company said: \u201cFor Nvidia, gamers come first. All activities related to our GeForce product line are targeted at our main audience.  \u201cTo ensure that GeForce gamers continue to have good GeForce graphics card availability in the current situation, we recommend that our trading partners make the appropriate arrangements to meet gamers\u2019 needs as usual.\u201d  Of course, the two-card purchasing rule is just a suggested limitation, and it\u2019s up to retailers to actually enforce it, with no comeback if they don\u2019t. And realistically, many retailers aren\u2019t likely to care exactly who is buying their products \u2013 or particularly want to go to the effort of policing orders \u2013 as long as cash is going into the till.  So it\u2019s certainly arguable how much tangible impact this move will make.  Still, it\u2019s something, and in some ways, this is more about Nvidia letting gamers know that it hasn\u2019t forgotten about them, and that is realizes the gravity of the situation, as graphics cards prices are starting to get silly thanks to the excessive demand.  Double money  For example, the GeForce GTX 1070 is the card many gamers would want to get, but looking on Newegg at the time of writing in the US, the cheapest model is $889 \u2013 and on the UK site, it\u2019s \u00a3707. Remember, this is supposed to be a card with a recommended price of around $380 or \u00a3380, so you\u2019re basically paying double right now.  That isn\u2019t necessarily true across the entire spectrum of GPUs, but price pressure is clearly getting ridiculous, and some models are completely out of stock at some retailers. Even a supposedly wallet-friendly GTX 1060 will now set you back around $330 or \u00a3240 on Newegg.  It\u2019s a miserable situation which means that those looking to upgrade their graphics card, or those building a new PC and looking for a GPU to go inside, are pretty much throwing their hands up in despair.  Of course, the mining craze is currently being fuelled by the recent major boom in cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin leading the (volatile) charge. Although mining the latter is now dominated by dedicated ASIC devices, other virtual currencies have shot up in its wake, and the likes of Ethereum can still be effectively mined using PCs sporting multiple graphics cards.  There\u2019s been plenty of discussion around this topic across the net, as you can imagine, with many not understanding why Nvidia and AMD can\u2019t simply produce more GPUs to meet demand \u2013 but there are obviously production issues to consider. Ramping up the assembly lines isn\u2019t just a matter of flipping a switch.  Perhaps the real solution will be the production of more mining-dedicated graphics cards \u2013 with no video output ports \u2013 specifically targeting the cryptocurrency market. Fingers crossed that everything settles down sooner rather than later, but we\u2019re not particularly optimistic about that right now.

Furthermore, TweakTown\u2019s source reportedly said of the new product line that \"it [the new cards] won't necessarily end in '70' and '80' like we're used to.\u201d  This could see Nvidia applying different numerals to its product names from what it currently does, which starts at 50 (e.g. Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050) up through 80. TweakTown speculates that Nvidia could denote its products in increments of five (i.e. GTX 1185).  However, and this is speculation of our own, it\u2019s possible that Nvidia simply wishes not to constrict itself within its own naming convention, leaving room for products closer in numeral so as to be geared toward specific, niche use cases \u2013 or to broaden the GTX name\u2019s scope.  For instance, the successor to the Nvidia MX150 could be the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1140 and so forth, allowing Nvidia to introduce the GTX name to even lower-spec products.

With most of the best gaming moments being shared on Gfycat or as just plain GIFs, it was inevitable that Nvidia GeForce would be able to let you create some of your own. Nvidia has added the ability for everyone to export their Highlights as GIFs just as they could have previously shot short videos.  Highlights, of course, is a ShadowPlay feature the GPU maker introduced in August 2017 that automatically captures gamers\u2019 greatest moments.  Up until now users have only been able to share these moments as images or videos. Pictures are easy to share but might only capture a single snapshot of a greater story, meanwhile, uploading video requires a YouTube account or another client. Being able to save and share moments as a GIF splits the difference between both as modestly sized segments everyone can share easily.  Gamers will be able to create Highlights from even more games now that Call of Duty WWII, Tekken, Dying Light: Bad Blood and Escape from Tarkov have all joined the roster. Nvidia also released the first public SDK for Highlights along with support for the Unreal and Unity engines, so we\u2019ll likely see an explosion of supported titles later this year.

So, that means MacBook Pro models released since 2016, iMac models since 2017 and the brand new iMac Pro.  Of course, you\u2019ll also need this update installed, which is available through the Mac App Store.

The company best known for its powerful graphics cards has in recent years waded into the self-driving car waters, and it currently counts over 370 partners in the space.  But following a fatal accident last week in which an Uber self-driving car struck and killed a pedestrian while in autonomous driving mode, Nvidia is suspending its testing.  \"The accident was tragic. It's a reminder of how difficult [self-driving car] technology is and that it needs to be approached with extreme caution and the best safety technologies,\" Nvidia said in a statement.  \"This tragedy is exactly why we've committed ourselves to perfecting this life-saving technology. Ultimately [autonomous vehicles] will be far safer than human drivers, so this important work needs to continue. We are temporarily suspending the testing of our self-driving cars on public roads to learn from the Uber incident. Our global fleet of manually driven data collection vehicles continue to operate.\"  The data collection vehicles are cars in the traditional sense; a driver is at the wheel controlling the vehicle while an autonomous sensor suite collects data, according to TechCrunch. News of Nvidia's self-driving car testing suspension was first reported by Reuters.  Speaking at the GTC 2018 conference in San Jose, California, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang acknowledged the Uber fatality, noting that while autonomy is where the transportation industry is headed, \"Safety is the single most important thing.\"  Nvidia announced in January that Uber had selected Nvidia technology to power its self-driving car AI, though Nvidia computing tech was already present in Uber's first fleet of Volvo XC90 SUVs.  Virtual testing  At the same time it's announcing the cessation of real-world testing, Nvidia also unveiled a new system for testing self-driving cars, one that takes place in virtual rather than real-world environments.  Nvidia DRIVE Constellation is a cloud-based computing platform that will test driving scenarios using photo-realistic simulations.  The system runs on two servers. The first server powers the Nvidia DRIVE Sim, a software set that emulates a self-driving car's various sensors, including its cameras, lidar and radar.  The second server houses the Nvidia DRIVE Pegasus AI, which will process the gathered data as if it's coming from sensors in a self-driving car on the road.  The testing may be taking place in a virtual environment, but it's happening on the same hardware and software that would be found in a self-driving car, Nvidia's Danny Shapiro explained in a briefing.  The simulator is constantly validating information coming from the DRIVE Pegasus AI, while the DRIVE Sim can create virtual driving scenarios ranging from rain to glare to limited night vision.  Nvidia says that in addition to being a safer way to test the technology for self-driving cars, the DRIVE Constellation also allows for faster testing; collecting data from billions of miles on virtual roads and innumerable scenarios in much less time than self-driving cars could gather on the road.  It's not yet clear to what degree Nvidia will rely on virtual testing versus real-world testing once its public driving tests resume.  New solution?  Nvidia's announcements come at a pivotal time for the self-driving car industry.  Less than 10 days ago, an Uber self-driving car struck and killed a pedestrian who was walking outside of a crosswalk in Tempe, Arizona. The car was in autonomous mode when it struck the victim, and it is the first known pedestrian death involving a self-driving car.  Following the accident, Uber suspended all self-driving car tests in North America. Earlier today, Arizona Governor Doug Ducey suspended Uber's ability to test and operate self-driving cars on public roads in the state.  The accident has called into the question the safety of testing self-driving cars on public roads.  It remains to be seen how effective Nvidia DRIVE Constellation is at putting self-driving cars through the paces and how that testing translates into the real world.  Testing may not involve putting self-driving cars on public streets, with all the safety issues that entails, but virtual environments aren't real ones, no matter how authentic the simulations seem.", "stock": "NVDA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-27", "source": "techradar", "url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/nvidia-suspends-self-driving-car-tests-as-it-announces-a-new-virtual-testing-solution"}, {"article": "The Nvidia GPU Technology Conference might have come and gone without any mention of next generation graphics cards, but one memory supplier has confirmed it will utilize GDDR6 video memory.

Looking at the laptop\u2019s screen lid alone, the thick fullers (or troughs) etched into the metal give the laptop a unique and beautiful identity. Though it might seem like the top of the notebook has a ridged surface, it\u2019s actually an illusion of the brushed aluminum finish on the flat metal.  Open the laptop, and you\u2019re greeted with an equally unorthodox form factor with its keyboard moved towards the bottom edge of the machine and a touchpad sitting off the lower right hand side. As with other similar gaming laptops, like the Asus ROG Zephyrus GX501 and Acer Predator Triton 700 , Samsung opted for this design to accommodate cooling for high-end hardware.  What\u2019s more, this form factor allows the laptop to remain at a relatively small 14.78 x 10.03 x 0.71 inch (37.5 x 24.5 x 13.5; W x D x H) size and 5.3 pound weight (2.4kg).  As with our past experience with other similar laptops, getting used to the Odyssey Z 15\u2019s right-handed trackpad takes some getting used to. But, with time, you might find the desktop arrangement of the pointing device even better than its usual place on notebooks. Thankfully, the keyboard on this 15-inch machine is also a joy, as it offers plenty of travel and \u2018crater\u2019 (i.e. concave) keycaps for a comfortable typing experience.  The Samsung Odyssey Z 15 also features some unique keys positioned above the trackpad to start and stop gameplay recordings on the fly.  Specifications  Looks aside, the Samsung Odyssey Z 15 is shaping up to be the brand\u2019s most powerful gaming laptop yet. At the heart of this machine will be an 8th generation Intel Core i7 processor with six-cores and 12-threads.  Alongside that, Samsung has integrated a Nvidia GTX 1060 graphics chip, which will promises to always deliver high-resolution graphics.  To keep the system running cool, Samsung has introduced a Z AeroFlow Cooling System. The set up includes a Dynamic Spread Vapor Chamber, the Z AeroFlow Cooling Design and the Z Blade Blower. In this arrangement, the laptop\u2019s two fans push cool air though the system to remove heat from the CPU and GPU at the same time while expelling hot air.  During off load times or regular use, there\u2019s a silent operation mode that promises to keep fan noise to a low 22 decibels.  Rounding out the Samsung Odyssey Z 15\u2019s configuration is a 1TB solid-state drive and 16GB of DDR4 RAM. There unfortunately isn\u2019t any mention of pricing and, for the time being, the laptop will only be available in China and Korea. A Samsung spokesperson told us we can expect the gaming notebook to arrive stateside in the latter third of the year.  Early verdict  The Odyssey Z 15 looks like Samsung\u2019s most promising gaming laptop yet. With the looks of a luxury device and performance of a muscle book, this gaming laptop is looking like it will push the boundaries of what a thin-and-light machine can do.  While it might seem wholly dedicated to the pursuit of gaming with dedicated streaming keys, Samsung is also keeping every day use in mind with the inclusion of a silent operation mode. The Samsung Odyssey Z 15 is still a ways from its US release, but we can\u2019t wait to get some more time with it and will surely go into a full review with the gaming laptop then.", "stock": "NVDA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-04-03", "source": "techradar", "url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/samsung-odyssey-z-15"}, {"article": "The only thing better than the Ultra HD graphics and silky-smooth gameplay that PC gaming affords is all the cool gear surrounding your computer. From keyboards to mice, monitors, gaming chairs and headsets, PC gaming hardware goes much farther than your main rig.  While we\u2019re all still lusting after that ultra-wide gaming monitor or fancy keyboard, there are always new products to pine after. This year at CES 2018 , we got our first glimpse of some of the most desirable pieces of gaming gear we\u2019ve seen yet.  Asus Bezel-Free Kit  Multi-monitor setups for PC gaming can be amazing, especially for flight simulators and racing games but the only thing that sucks is seeing gaps between each of your screens. Asus\u2019 Bezel-Free monitor kit aims to eliminate the problem by optically merging two or more screens into a seamless picture.  Because it only uses prisms and the magic of light refraction, they can be slipped between practically any monitors with thin bezels and require no electronic control or power to work. If you\u2019re already using a dual or triple monitor setup, this is the easiest way to DIY an ultra-wide screen rather than outright buying a whole new display.  Expected: Late 2018  HP Omen X 65 BFGD  Nvidia Big Format Gaming Displays made a huge splash at CES 2018, and we came away most impressed by the HP version: the Omen X 65 BFGD . Just looking at specifications that include a 65-inch panel, 4K resolution, HDR compliancy, a 120Hz refresh rate and 1 millisecond response rate, it\u2019s hard not to be wowed. This truly is the ultimate display for PC gaming.  Expected: Fall 2018  Nvidia GeForce Now for PC beta  While this might not be a physical bit of kit, Nvidia GeForce Now coming to PC is something everyone will love. This gaming streaming service turns every Windows laptop, desktop and tablet into a gaming PC \u2013 whether it be a lowly netbook or a top of the line Ultrabook, almost anyone can access Nvidia\u2019s extensive online PC game library.  Expected: Available now  Corsair Dark Core RGB SE & MM1000 Qi  We\u2019ve seen a plenty of wireless mice and even a few wireless charging mice, but the Dark Core RGB SE is the first Qi-charging gaming mouse in the world. When paired with Corsair\u2019s new MM1000 Qi wireless charging mouse pad, you can practically run the Dark Core RGB SE forever. As a bonus, the whole wireless charging setup is fully compatible with Qi-charging phones, including the latest iPhone X and Samsung Galaxy Note 8 .  Expected: Available now  Cooler Master MasterKeys MK851  The Cooler Master MasterKeys MK851 might just look like another RGB backlit mechanical keyboard, but it comes with the unique feature of analog keys. Modern keyboards are fully digital inputs, but on its latest product, Cooler Master has included eight analog keys around and including the WASD keys.  These analog switches allow you to lightly press keys to move characters around more slowly. Alternatively, they could act like physical pedals for racing games and many more precise controls we\u2019ve yet to even imagine.  Expected: Mid 2018  Zotac AMP Box  We\u2019ve seen prototypes of Zotac external GPU box for well over a year now, so it was exciting to finally see it in its final form at CES 2018. Unlike the Razer Core and Asus ROG Station 2, the Zotac AMP Box is quite a bit smaller and designed for only mini GPUs. That said, this is one of the finest GPU boxes built completely out of aluminum while also featuring a fully customizable RGB lighting setup.  Expected: Early 2018  Razer Nommo Pro  Computer speakers are often overlooked for a PC gaming setup, but Razer\u2019s new Razer Nommo Pro delivers an incredible audio bang that headphones could never muster. The 2.1 THX certified speaker system features a Dupont Kevlar coated driver that projects solid mids, while silk-woven tweeters produce smooth and balanced highs.  Meanwhile, a cylindrical downward-firing subwoofer is designed to generate airflow for consistent, deep tones. Put all together, it\u2019s one of the fullest-sounding and loudest PC gaming speaker systems we\u2019ve ever heard.  Expected: Early 2018  Vertagear PL4500 RGB Gaming Chair  We never thought it would be possible, but Vertagear has integrated RGB lighting into a gaming chair. The PL4500 RGB comes with lighting built into the harness through-holes and underneath its base for an underglow effect. The whole thing is powered by batteries \u2013 that Vertagear claims can power its RGB gaming chair for 30 hours \u2013 and it can even wirelessly sync effects and colors to your PC through NZXT CAM. It\u2019s the perfect piece of furniture to complement your RGB lit PC, keyboard, mouse, mousepad and room lighting.  Expected: Spring 2018  SteelSeries Rival 600  The SteelSeries Rival 600 is one of the first dual-sensor gaming mice we\u2019ve seen. Going with two sensors not only makes it more accurate, it also reduces sensor drifting when you lift off with your mouse. This gaming mouse also comes with eight 4g weights, allowing users to increase its weight from 96g all the way to 128g.  Expected: Available now  MSI Optix MPG27CQ  We\u2019ve seen RGB lighting come to gaming monitors before, but the MSI Optix MPG27CQ might be the first display to actually put it to good use. Rather than putting the lights behind the screen or give monitors an underglow effect, they\u2019re right below the panel. This way users can set lights to signal ability cooldowns and other in-game timers or Discord chat notifications. We\u2019ve seen the same sort of utility come to keyboards, but it makes much more sense to get this information on a monitor you\u2019re already staring at.

Anyone even remotely interested in gaming would tell you that integrated graphics solutions don't really work, if you want to play the top and newest games.  A graphics card doesn\u2019t even need to take up a ton of space. With Nvidia\u2019s cutting-edge Max-Q tech for instance, you can run games in 4K in considerably thin laptops. But it comes at a pretty hefty price tag. Take the Asus ROG Zephyrus for an example.  AMD's renewed interest in high-end components showcased by the Radeon RX Vega has started a whole new battle in the best graphic cards market. So, here's some help to make your choice easier.  Best high-end GPU: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 Ti  Titan X performance without the Titan X cost  Stream Processors: 3,584 | Core Clock: 1,480MHz | Memory: 11GB GDDR5X | Memory Clock: 11GHz | Power Connectors: 1 x 6-pin; 1 x 8-pin | Outputs: 3 x DisplayPort, 1 x HDMI  Titan X-like gaming performance  Improved cooling  A pricey investment for most  The GTX 1080 Ti is exactly what the Titan X Pascal should have been. Thanks to 11GB of GDDR5X VRAM, the GTX 1080 Ti is more capable than the GTX 1080, without costing an arm and a leg.  Performance-wise, the GTX 1080 Ti can\u2019t compete with dual-wielding 1080s, but it is cheaper and it supports a larger pool of games than two lesser SLI cards. Aside from the mysterious absence of a DVI port, the GTX 1080 Ti looks identical to any of the other Pascal-series GPUs. However, take a closer inside and you\u2019ll notice a sophisticated cooling system needed to keep all of your games running smoothly in up to 4K resolutions.  Read the full review: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 Ti  Best mid-range GPU: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060  The best GPU to start PC gaming  Stream Processors: 1,280 | Core Clock: 1,506MHz | Memory: 6GB GDDR5 | Memory Clock: 8Gbps | Power Connectors: 1 x 6-pin | Outputs: 3 x DisplayPort 1.4, 1 x HDMI 2.0, DL-DVI  Solid 1080p performance  Great overclocker  No SLI compatibility  For Indian buyers though, value for money is often more important than raw power. And we think the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 is unparalleled when it comes to sheer value.  For a reasonable price, this graphics card offers 1080p gaming and \u2013 perhaps with a bit of overclocking \u2013 even 1440p. At the same time, however, the GTX 1060 doesn\u2019t have SLI support, so you\u2019re limited to a single card at a time.  Read the full review: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060  Best entry-level GPU: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 Ti  Competitive for both eSports and in price  Stream Processors: 768 | Core Clock: 1,290MHz | Memory: 4GB GDDR5 | Memory Clock: 7Gbps | Power Connectors: PCIe | Outputs: 1 x DisplayPort 1.4, 1 x HDMI 2.0, DL-DVI  Solid 1080p performer  Good overclocking potential  Greater than 75W TDP  The Nvidia GTX 1050 Ti is another an affordable option.

This might lead you to hope that pressure could be eased when it comes to miners pushing prices up by purchasing gaming GPUs. But sadly, we\u2019re inclined to believe that may prove to be a false hope\u2026  At any rate, the rumor from Crypto Mining Blog is that Nvidia is about to release new graphics cards based on the firm\u2019s GP102 GPU (as used in the Titan X and Xp cards, and GeForce GTX 1080 Ti), with one specific board mentioned which is coming from Inno3D.  Apparently, this P102-100 mining GPU from Inno3D (pictured below) will run with 3,200 CUDA cores and a base clock speed of 1582MHz. It will have 5GB of GDDR5X video RAM and a TDP of 250W, and for cooling, will use dual-fans and five copper heat pipes.  As this is a dedicated cryptocurrency mining card, there won\u2019t be any video outputs to connect the GPU up to a monitor. Therefore, these products are strictly for miners only.  The graphics card will be able to achieve mining hash rates of up to 47MH/s in Ethereum, and 879H/s when it comes to Monero, and the leak claims that this information comes directly from the manufacturer \u2013 although Inno3D doesn\u2019t specify whether this is at stock clocks (as opposed to post-overclocking).  As expected, there is no indication of pricing at the moment, and that will obviously be a key talking point.  Once again, let\u2019s underline the fact that this is speculation at this point, although the details provided by the blog concerning the spec of the purported Inno3D GPU are pretty in-depth.  Image Credit: Crypto Mining Blog (Image: \u00a9 Crypto Mining Blog)  Pressure points  If this graphics card does indeed emerge in the near future as indicated, can we then hope that this will be one of a number of fresh mining models with Nvidia GPUs? Likewise, hopefully their launch might help take the pressure off the huge demand for GeForce gaming GPUs that are currently being used for mining, pushing the prices of these cards up massively.  As we mentioned at the outset, while this is certainly a grand hope, the reality is probably very different. For starters, we have to consider that there\u2019s a shortage of video memory affecting all GPU makers right now, and that isn\u2019t predicted to ease until much later this year.  So, these new mining cards will still face the same issue as gaming-targeted GeForce GPUs: quite simply, there\u2019s only so much memory to go around.  Secondly, from the chatter we\u2019ve seen online, miners are still eyeing up GeForce models as a better overall value proposition than dedicated mining GPUs. One issue is resale value: a GeForce GTX card will carry its weight going forward in that respect, whereas a video card strictly for mining \u2013 with no possibility for usage anywhere else due to the lack of display outputs \u2013 has very limited resale prospects.  Finally, another apparent thorn is speculation about these mining cards' pricing being pitched relatively high, so that GeForce cards may remain a more economical proposition anyway (particularly considering the aforementioned resale considerations).  This all comes together to suggest that miners may indeed buy these dedicated GPUs, but not ahead of GeForce models.  Price of profits  Naturally, a lot of this will depend on where Nvidia and third-party manufacturers pitch the price of these mining-specific offerings, and as they\u2019re cut-down cards, we could hope for the best. But the reality is given the memory shortage and state of supply and demand in the GPU market, there isn\u2019t any realistic incentive to chop into chunky profits.  So, how does all this add up overall? Assuming these cards are imminent, we may not see much price pressure relief in the graphics card market simply due to the way things are with the scarcity of video RAM right now.  But that doesn\u2019t stop this being a hopeful sign for the future, if not the nearer-term. Later in 2018, when the memory shortage is forecast to ease, perhaps we\u2019ll see more of these kind of dedicated GPUs emerging \u2013 and then the prices of gaming graphics cards could finally start to normalize again.  These are the best graphics cards you can buy in 2018  Via Wccftech.com", "stock": "NVDA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-13", "source": "techradar", "url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/nvidia-may-launch-new-graphics-cards-designed-for-cryptocurrency-miners"}, {"article": "It seems that buyers of laptops which run with Nvidia\u2019s GeForce MX150 discrete graphics should be aware that there are reportedly two different versions of this GPU, one of which apparently offers considerably less on the performance front.  According to some digging done by NotebookCheck, these two variants are differentiated by their device ID of \u201810DE 1D10\u2019 and \u201810DE 1D12\u2019, the former of which is the standard (full-speed) GPU, and the latter runs with lesser clock speeds and a lower power draw.  NotebookCheck posted an example GPU-Z (a graphics diagnostics and benchmark tool) screenshot of a standard 1D10 version of the MX150 running in an Asus ZenBook UX430UN with a clock speed of 1,469MHz and boost to 1,532MHz.  Then, the report shows a shot of the 1D12 flavor running in a Lenovo IdeaPad 320S with a far slower base clock speed of 937MHz with boost to 1,038MHz. The memory is also clocked 250MHz lower in this variant of the GPU \u2013 other specs, such as the amount of CUDA cores, remain the same.  The TDP, or thermal design power, of these two versions of the MX150 are very different, too, with the former hitting 25W, and the slower 1D12 only using 10W. So, the latter would appear to be a cut-down version designed for thinner and lighter laptops where thermals are more of a concern.  Update: Nvidia has provided TechRadar with the following statement regarding this report:  \"The MX150 is a Pascal-based GPU featuring 384 CUDA cores. We work closely with OEM [original equipment manufacturer] partners to optimize their specific design constraints for things such as TDP, battery capacity, CPU speed and more. Overall performance and specifications will vary based on OEM implementation and design considerations.\"  Signage for the slow lane?  All this might seem fair enough on the face of it. However, the issue here is that Nvidia doesn\u2019t make any distinction between these two flavors of the GeForce MX150 on its website or in marketing materials, so it isn\u2019t letting would-be buyers know that they are potentially getting a slower spin on the GPU.  That said, on its spec page for the MX150, Nvidia does note: \u201cActual implementation may vary by OEM model. Please refer to OEM website for actual shipping specifications.\u201d  Arguably, then, it\u2019s the notebook manufacturer which is responsible for the implementation of the GPU in its product, and it\u2019s down to the vendor to make the spec clear in the laptop\u2019s product description.  Although Tom\u2019s Hardware, which spotted the original story, argues that, as the different spins on the MX150 have different device IDs, the speed differences are implemented at the firmware level by Nvidia.  So, in short, it\u2019s not clear exactly where any potential lack of transparency lies. But, by all accounts, if you\u2019re buying a laptop with a GeForce MX150, you\u2019d do well to thoroughly check the specs and try to ascertain if the device runs with a slower version of this graphics card, as per these claims.", "stock": "NVDA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-22", "source": "techradar", "url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/slower-nvidia-geforce-mx150-gpu-reportedly-found-in-some-laptops"}, {"article": "There's probably still a fair few folks using 32-bit versions of Windows or Linux, despite the fact that a 64-bit version of Windows XP was released on October 25th, 2001.

The idea is relatively simple: Instead of having to buy, maintain and upgrade your own hardware, you pay Blade a monthly subscription to use theirs. It's a concept similar to what NVIDIA did with its GeForce NOW cloud service, Parsec or HP's Omen PCs, save for the fact that those three are dedicated to gaming while Shadow enables users to run everything from Steam to Photoshop to a host of other business-related applications.  The company has partnered with Microsoft, NVIDIA, AMD and Equinix to create a remote Windows 10 PC that you can access over the internet. At the remote server farm, each of these systems boasts a dedicated NVIDIA graphics card capable of handling 1080p at 144Hz or 4K at 60Hz. For processing, the system relies on eight dedicated threads on an Intel Xeon processor (the equivalent of an Intel Core i7) as well as offering 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage.  Therefore, it doesn't matter what hardware you're using to access the service. Shadow can run on Macs, Chromebooks, Windows PCs, Android, iOS, and a variety of smart TV platforms. However, this does lead to a paradox. Sure, Shadow can deliver 4K quality video streams over the internet, but if you're trying to watch it on an old 720p monitor, you're going to be watching that stream in 720p.  Luckily, that doesn't seem to apply to the rest of the capabilities. Because the Shadow system is, in essence, a remote desktop, it doesn't matter how old, underpowered or decrepit the device is you're running it on, just how good the screen is. In fact, at CES, Blade managed to run the Shadow service on Razer's new phone, running full PC games (e.g., Battlefront II) on the device at 2K resolution and 120 Hz.  What's also cool is that you're able to switch between operating systems on the fly. Say you're virtualizing the Shadow's Windows 10 desktop on your Mac. Because the Windows 10 OS is running remotely (only using the Mac's video driver to decode signal), it doesn't take up any of the Mac's other local resources.

It runs on remote servers powered by NVIDIA's Tesla GPUs, which the company says offers gaming performance on par with its GTX 1080 cards. While NVIDIA isn't divulging further specifications, you can bet they're also stuffed with more than enough RAM and CPU horsepower. (NVIDIA claimed they were the equivalent of a $1,500 gaming PC a year ago.) When you launch GeForce Now, you're actually watching a video streaming to your PC. But since there's very little latency between what you're seeing and your keyboard and mouse inputs, it feels as if the games are running right on your computer.  You don't need a very powerful PC to run the GeForce Now client. At the minimum, NVIDIA recommends using a 3.1GHz Core i3 processor and 4GB RAM, along with either Intel HD 2000, GeForce 600 series or Radeon HD 3000 graphics. Those are all specs you'll find in PCs four to six years old. But of course, solid internet access is a must. You'll need speeds of at least 25Mbps, but NVIDIA advises a 50Mbps connection for the best experience. You'll also have to make sure your computer has a reliable link to your router -- which means you'll either need to use an Ethernet cable or a 5GHz Wi-Fi network.  At the moment, GeForce Now on Macs and PCs only lets you play games you already own on Steam, Blizzard's Battle.net or Ubisoft's Uplay. Anything you don't own can be purchased through the streaming platform. That's a major difference from GeForce Now on NVIDIA's Shield tablet and set-top box, which includes a handful of titles as part of its $7.99 monthly fee as well as games for purchase. Both versions of the service support popular titles like Overwatch, Call of Duty WWII and The Witcher 3, but you'll probably have to wait a bit for them to work with lesser-known games. NVIDIA isn't specifying what it takes to make a game compatible with the service, but I'd wager it has to test them out to make sure nothing breaks in the streaming process.  Setting up GeForce Now is as easy as downloading and installing the client and choosing a title to play. Then you just need to provide your login information for whichever service hosts the game. If you're launching a Steam title, you'll end up seeing the service's familiar Windows interface, where you can either buy the game or download it to your library. One big downside with GeForce Now is that you'll have to install games every time you want to play them, since you're thrown onto a different server whenever you log in. It's not a huge problem, though, since the remote machines are plugged into a fat network pipe and offer unlimited storage.

NVDA -1.32% is scheduled to announce earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter after the market closes Thursday. Here\u2019s what to look for:  EARNINGS FORECAST: Analysts expect Nvidia to report per-share earnings of $1.16 cents, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters, up 17% from the same quarter a year earlier.  REVENUE FORECAST: Analysts expect total revenue of $2.68 billion for the quarter, up 23% from a year earlier.  WHAT TO WATCH:  CHIPS FOR AI: Sales to giant internet companies are the biggest driver of Nvidia\u2019s stock, analysts say. Customers like Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com and Microsoft Corp. have been buying up the company\u2019s graphics chips to drive artificial-intelligence calculations that help them, for instance, auto-tag objects in photos. Data-center growth, which has increased by double digits from quarter to quarter for most of the last two years, declined to 2% in the second quarter, then rebounded to 20% in the third. Investors will be looking for sustained momentum, said analyst Mitch Steves of RBC Capital Markets LLC. He\u2019s looking for mid-single to double-digit sequential growth in data-center sales.  CRYPTOCURRENCY MINING: Miners of electronic currencies like Ethereum have embraced graphics cards to speed up calculations that unearth the digital coins. But such sales, which Nvidia reports in its gaming and OEM segments, are a double-edged sword for the company, analysts said: They\u2019ve been bringing in substantial revenue in recent quarters, but they might disappear if the vogue for cryptocurrency mining wanes. \u201cNvidia has played down importance of crypto because they know it can be fickle depending on the price of the currency, and they want to support their fan base among gamers,\u201d said Stifel Financial Corp. analyst Kevin Cassidy. It is hard to differentiate between online sales to gamers and purchases by miners, he said, but investors will be looking for clues to crypto-related revenue in the quarter and beyond.  NEXT-GEN GAMING CARDS: Sales of gaming gear account for more than half of Nvidia\u2019s annual revenue, propelled by new products. The company has been shipping data-center chips based on its Volta design in significant volume since last summer, but it hasn\u2019t said on when, or even whether, it will roll out gaming cards based on the new architecture. \u201cThe timing is something people will be curious about because it should provide a decent tailwind,\u201d said analyst Blayne Curtis of Barclays PLC.

NVDA -1.32% , which has made a broad push to bring its computing platform into self-driving cars, said Tuesday it will temporarily halt testing of its driverless technology on public roads following the fatal crash of an Uber Technologies Inc. autonomous vehicle.  The company said its suspension involves its own fleet of test cars, which are being driven on public roads in California and New Jersey.  Uber has also used Nvidia\u2019s computing technology in its Volvo XC90 SUVs, the same type of vehicle that struck a pedestrian on March 18 in Tempe, Ariz. The two companies in January officially announced that Uber selected Nvidia\u2019s artificial-intelligence computing system for its fleet of self-driving cars and freight trucks. Nvidia\u2019s chips and software help robot cars instantly crunch the vast amounts of data from sensors and cameras to make split-second decisions.  It isn\u2019t clear if Nvidia\u2019s technology was in the car that struck 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg, who later died of her injuries.  \u201cMost self-driving vehicle prototypes and test vehicles use Nvidia technology,\u201d an Nvidia spokesman said in a statement. \u201cIn some case, customers are developing their own software and we don\u2019t have details of their algorithms.\u201d The spokesman said Nvidia is seeking to find out more details on Uber\u2019s configuration and software.  An Uber spokeswoman declined to comment on the matter.  Police said the Uber vehicle was traveling at about 40 miles an hour and didn\u2019t brake before hitting Ms. Herzberg, who was crossing her bike outside of a crosswalk. Specialists in autonomous technology said the car\u2019s sensors should have detected Ms. Herzberg, and that the car\u2019s artificial-intelligence system should have understood she was a pedestrian.  Following the crash, Uber said it was temporarily suspending testing of its self-driving cars in four cities as investigators studied the incident. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey on Monday barred Uber from testing its cars in the state. At least one auto maker, Toyota Motor Corp. , decided to temporarily halt public testing of its own self-driving vehicles.  Nvidia, a graphics-chip specialist that lately has become the leader in chips for artificial intelligence, said in a prepared statement it was temporarily suspending tests \u201cto learn from the Uber incident.\u201d Its fleet of cars for data collection, which are driven by human drivers, will continue to operate.  Nvidia\u2019s stock was recently down more than 7% to $226.39 on Tuesday following the company\u2019s announcement, which was reported earlier by Reuters.  Nvidia has made big bets on developing artificial intelligence for self-driving cars, and competes head-to-head with Intel Corp. in developing autonomous technology. The company said Tuesday it is working with 370 companies on autonomous vehicle technology, including auto makers such as Audi AG , Daimler AG , Toyota, Volkswagen AG and Volvo Group.  Nvidia has emphasized safety in its autonomous-vehicle program. On Tuesday, the chip maker introduced a system for training self-driving cars using simulation rather than real-world driving of the type that resulted in the fatality in Arizona.  That system feeds computer-generated imagery into the company\u2019s automotive brain, as though the car were viewing the world through cameras and other sensors. The brain\u2019s reactions feed back into the simulator, which alters its imagery accordingly. The technology allows self-driving cars to encounter particular hazards any number of times so they can fine-tune their responses, the company said, ultimately improving their handling of real-world conditions.  In January, Nvidia announced that its self-driving car platform met the international safety standard known as ISO 26262, including features such as redundant functions in case one part of a system fails.

Above, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang speaks at CES earlier this year. Photo: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg News  Nvidia NVDA -1.32% and Facebook are two very different companies. But both have recently come to learn a painful lesson: When tech is everywhere, so are the risks.  Facebook, of course, has been battered over its handling of user data. Nvidia\u2019s challenges are very different. The company, whose main business is making chips for videogames, has spent the past couple of years aggressively building chips designed to run self-driving cars. This has led to partnerships with several auto makers as well as companies like Uber, which has been developing its own fleet of autonomous vehicles.  But the problem with putting tech in the driver\u2019s seat is that the buck tends to stop there as well. One of Uber\u2019s self-driving cars was involved in a fatal accident on March 18. Nvidia\u2019s technology wasn\u2019t blamed for the incident, and CEO Jensen Huang said late Wednesday that Uber doesn\u2019t even use the company\u2019s self-driving car system.  But Nvidia still elected to temporarily suspend tests of the vehicles using its platform while investigating the matter. That has meant a lot of bucks for Nvidia\u2019s investors. The highflying stock has shed 12%\u2014nearly $18 billion in market value\u2014since the accident.  Nvidia still generates most of its sales from graphics chips used in videogames. But the company\u2019s significant advancements with artificial intelligence has opened the door to new and expansive opportunities. Companies like Google, Microsoft and Amazon are snapping up Nvidia\u2019s chips to deploy artificial intelligence capabilities in their data centers. Nvidia\u2019s sales into this segment more than doubled in the fiscal year ended January and are expected to surge more than 60% this year to about $3.2 billion. The company also told analysts on Tuesday that it now sees its total addressable market in this space as being worth about $50 billion in the next five years.  The opportunity for self-driving cars is further out. Nvidia is projected to get 5% of its total revenue from autos in the next two years, but much of that will come from infotainment systems, not autonomous vehicles. But while that may limit the actual business risk, Nvidia\u2019s name is now closely synced to the development of autonomous cars. That means mishaps involving those types of cars will likely weigh on the company\u2019s shares.  That is far different from Facebook, whose core business is under fire. Yet both stocks have fallen sharply over the past two weeks. Nvidia\u2019s was hit so hard in part because its market value has doubled over the past year.  That has put the chipmaker\u2019s value on par with that of much-larger tech names like IBM . Nvidia also is one of the more expensive chip stocks on the market at 35 times forward earnings, though its rapidly expanding bottom line has moderated that valuation a bit. The company\u2019s record to this point suggests it can still deliver on some outsize expectations. But investors should be ready for new twists in the road.

It might also be sniffing another danger, from economics.  Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix\u2019s sales pitch was simple and powerful: his firm\u2019s personality-profiling ability would let politicians win votes by tapping into people\u2019s deepest fears and desires. Clients of the company, including Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, said Cambridge Analytica struggled to make good on Nix\u2019s bold claims.  Europe\u2019s economic boom and its increasingly stable politics have fulfilled investors\u2019 deepest wishes over the last year. All bar one: European stocks haven\u2019t made them a single euro. In the past 12 months, the Stoxx Europe 600 has delivered a 1% loss in local-currency terms, accounting for both share-price appreciation and dividends.

Amazon, the worst-hit stock on the S&P 500, is on pace to close in correction territory, according to the WSJ\u2019s Market Data Group. Shares slid Wednesday amid speculation that the White House wants to clamp down on the e-commerce giant\u2019s growing dominance. The stock was down 6.2% in lunchtime trading.

The logo for Twitter, which fell more than Facebook on Tuesday, on a phone post at the New York Stock Exchange in 2015. Photo: Richard Drew/Associated Press  The highflying technology stocks had been ignoring rising threats for a while. Reality reasserted itself on Tuesday.  The immediate cause for plummeting tech shares was company-specific: Chip maker Nvidia Corp. NVDA -1.32% halted road tests of driverless vehicles after an Uber Technologies Inc. test car was involved in a fatal crash, and Facebook Inc. FB 0.40% CEO Mark Zuckerberg will be hauled before Congress. The announcements highlighted the risks to two of the biggest tech disruption themes, self-driving cars and social media.  But the market fall wasn\u2019t just about Facebook and Nvidia, or even self-driving cars and social media, although the themes mattered, with Tesla Inc. dropping more than Nvidia, and Twitter Inc. TWTR -0.83% losing more than Facebook.  Instead, the market is waking up to an even broader threat: politics. It might also be sniffing another danger, from economics.  The political risk is obvious for Facebook, which stands at the unpleasant intersection of privacy fears and fake news. Facebook is accused of unwittingly aiding the manipulation of the U.S. election by Russian agents, of helping swing the Brexit referendum and, linked to both cases, failing to notice that the personal details of 50 million users had been snatched.  The arguments about who, what, where and why are far from being resolved, but Facebook highlights the forces gathering against tech investors. Disruptive companies are bound to make powerful enemies in old industries, but the tech companies have alienated many natural supporters among the wider public through their swagger, wealth and tax avoidance. Businesses that were once beloved by consumers for taking on the corporate establishment have become the corporate establishment in the eyes of many of their customers.  Cities and states were first to flex their muscles, forcing companies such as Uber and Airbnb Inc. to follow local rules and pay taxes. The threats now are much bigger.  The European Commission is pushing for a 3% tax on the revenue of internet giants, while pressure is increasing for \u201cgig economy\u201d workers to be treated as employees. The rush by companies to pull their ads from Facebook may be merely temporary, but it shows just how far the social network has slumped in public opinion and how much privacy is becoming an issue for Americans. In Europe, privacy rules have just been tightened again.  There is also a backlash to the sheer scale of many of the big internet companies. Earnest discussion among economists about the new monopolies is unlikely to lead directly to government intervention, but a change in public perception makes antitrust action more likely. Again, Europe has been leading the way by taking on Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google.  There is a further danger, from the economy. A stronger economy should mean more companies are able to demonstrate rising sales. Investors who want growth will be able to buy businesses exposed to the economic cycle, and the fast-expanding tech companies will lose some of their exclusivity in the minds of shareholders. The same point can be seen by looking at interest rates. As rates rise, profits far in the future look less attractive, which should compress the valuation of disrupters reinvesting all their earnings in the hope of future returns. If\u2014and it is a big if\u2014you expect the economy to improve and bond yields to rise, disruptive tech stocks should be less appealing.  Tech stocks rode high in the past three years, ignoring all these concerns as investors focused on the extraordinary profits and dominant market shares many were producing. Sentiment was overly positive, and the backlash was ignored.  It isn\u2019t always true that highflying stocks fall further, but it certainly was on Tuesday. Out of the top 100 stocks in the S&P 500 for the year to Monday, 39 were in the bottom 100 on Tuesday, about double what would be expected by chance. It worked the other way, too, with just over one-third of the bottom 100 stocks for the year in the top 100 on Tuesday, led by General Electric Co. , the fifth-worst performer this year and the best on Tuesday.  In the short run, the drop means the overly fast upward momentum of the big tech stocks has abated, leaving them less exposed to further selling driven by technical factors, although Amazon.com Inc. led more falls on Wednesday after a report that President Donald Trump wants to target the company.  In the longer run, expect lots of contrition from tech company CEOs as they try to head off political pressure on the bottom line.

That's why they've become China's biggest companies by market value, at $532 billion for Tencent and $465 billion for Alibaba.  The pair's business models are also incredibly different. Alibaba gets most of its money from advertising, not e-commerce, whereas Tencent's WeChat has only just started tapping the ad market.  Alipay and WeChat Pay are good examples of how they stand out. No Western company has achieved even a sliver of what these products have managed. Mobile payments are ubiquitous in China in a way that makes the U.S. look like it's stuck in the Stone Age.

Equate Jack Ma's empire to that of Amazon if you like, but first tell me about Amazon Pay. Tencent's version, meanwhile, came from WeChat, the most powerful communications tool in China. No company worldwide has come close to the depth and breadth of WeChat usage.  Exhibit A: WhatsApp. Bought by Facebook Inc. for $19 billion four years ago, Mark Zuckerberg has barely done anything with it. Don't blame Chinese censorship and protectionism for the fact that you can't book and pay for a doctor's appointment over WhatsApp.  Similar can be said not only for Alibaba but its affiliate Ant Financial, which has become a vehicle for money market investments, bill payments and loans. It's only recently there have been reports from the Wall Street Journal about Amazon considering offering checking accounts.  On hardware, people often accuse Chinese brands Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo and others of copying Apple Inc. That was once a valid observation. Xiaomi's business model is unique, though, and it has since gone on to develop its own designs based on technology developed and sold by U.S. companies.  It's also made a significant mark in India, which no Western smartphone company has managed. To complain that Chinese hardware vendors have the benefit of cheaper labor is a non-starter.

There's a reason Alibaba is buying an equity stake, but it's not that.  A mega IPO from the world's largest fintech unicorn? Don't bet on it.  Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. said Thursday it plans to acquire 33 percent of its affiliate Ant Financial in exchange for certain intellectual property rights. When the deal closes, the companies will end the profit-sharing arrangement by which Ant pays royalty and other fees equaling 37.5 percent of its pretax profit to Alibaba.  The news sparked speculation Alibaba may be planning to take Ant public. The owner of Alipay was last valued at $60 billion, making it the world's second-most-valuable startup after Uber Technologies Inc.  Not So Tiny Ant Financial is the world's second-largest unicorn after Uber, valued at $60 billion Source: Crunchbase  But a look at Ant's earnings doesn't make the case that it's ready for a share sale. In the quarter through Dec. 31, Alibaba received a payment of 193 million yuan ($31 million) from Ant, down from 2 billion yuan in the September period. That's a 90 percent drop. Alibaba said that subsidy payments to acquire new Alipay users were behind the decline.  Squashed Ant Financial's profit contribution to Alibaba tumbled in the December quarter Source: Alibaba company filings  The nagging question is why Alibaba is doing this now, when it's had the option to buy into Ant since 2014.  Ant's business is facing some challenges. My guess is Alibaba management can see this is a company that can't afford to be paying out 37.5 percent of pretax income in the form of a dividend. In taking an equity stake, it's lending a helping hand.  As I wrote in December, Ant must navigate an increasingly complex web of rules covering everything from micro loans to the billions of dollars of client money it holds in escrow. Regulators in China tend to leave flourishing sectors like fintech alone, until they don't -- then out comes the wooden paddle.  Until recently, micro lending was very lucrative. Ant's two micro-lending subsidiaries have over the past year packaged up thousands of consumer loans and sold them to institutional investors in the form of asset-backed securities. As a result, in the first nine months of 2017, one of the units, Jiebei, generated 5.3 billion yuan of operating profit on just 3.8 billion yuan of capital. According to Bernstein Research, consumer lending accounts for almost 20 percent of Ant's income.  Empire Building Ant's revenue streams span payments to consumer lending to insurance distribution Source: Bernstein Research  The milk in that cash cow turned sour in December, when Beijing said Ant couldn't issue ABS exceeding 2.3 times its total capital. Now, to grow its micro-lending business, Ant needs to inject cash. In mid-December, Ant raised Jiebei's registered capital to 12 billion yuan.  Other areas of Ant's empire are under pressure. Because of Alibaba's dominance in e-commerce, Ant holds billions of dollars of client money in escrow, on which it can earn substantial interest income. But 12 months ago, the People's Bank of China ruled that all third-party payment platforms must deposit 20 percent of those funds in non-interest-earning reserves at designated banks. That threshold may be raised to 50 percent this year. This easy money used to comprise about 17 percent of Ant's revenue.  Don't think I'm all down on this deal, however.  Were Ant to IPO, investors in Asia, and possibly beyond, would have a chance to buy into China's dominant mobile-payments provider. And while middle-class consumers may not want the cheap stuff on Alibaba's Taobao, no doubt we'll all be using Alipay one day for everything from train tickets in Hong Kong to taxis in Singapore and clothes shopping in Osaka.  U.S. investors have been advocating for years for an Ant IPO to unlock the so-called conglomerate discount. What they need is patience. Ant's financials may not be looking so rosy now but this is a company with huge potential. It could one day become even bigger than Alibaba itself. Now that would be a share sale worth waiting for.

The online bazaar now spends more on marketing than technology.  For all the talk of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. being a massive online bazaar, the Chinese behemoth once spent large sums of money on its technology.  As recently as 18 months ago, the company regularly devoted more funds to R&D than it did marketing. Those days appear over.  Investors poring over the latest financials will salivate at the company raising its full-year revenue forecast, or finally swapping its profit-sharing agreement with Ant Financial for an actual equity stake. They're both important headline items, but they paper over a deeper change in Alibaba's strategy that could have a longer-term impact.  Desperate to keep the flywheel spinning, Alibaba's sales and marketing budget climbed 90 percent in the December quarter, more than twice the 42 percent growth rate for R&D.  Spinning While Alibaba's marketing spend rebounded, growth in its R&D budget has lagged Source: Alibaba, Bloomberg  This means that it now spends more money on pushing its offering than actually developing it. Alibaba fans could argue that the past decade of research is now paying off with a product that doesn't require such heavy investment. Many may not even care as long as that virtuous cycle of users coming to the platform, ads convincing them to spend, and turnover washing through the pipes continues at a healthy clip.  Priorities Alibaba now spends more money on promoting its platform than it does on building it Source: Bloomberg, Alibaba  Yet, just today, Alibaba talked up the importance of its technology. Artificial intelligence drives user engagement it shouted in bold type, highlighting growth on its Taobao platform  We continue to invest in machine learning technologies which we apply to use cases that match consumer intent and product selection to deliver the best consumer experience.  Just a few months back, it trumpeted a massive boost for its self-proclaimed DAMO academy (discovery, adventure, momentum and outlook). I've already pointed out that this bold proclamation of huge R&D largess is a bit of a misnomer, though at least they care enough to bother with the pretense.  But marketing executives don't build AI, and ad spend doesn't produce technological breakthroughs -- in fact, it's often the other way around.  Alibaba is already China's king of e-commerce, yet there are plenty of Davids ready to slay this Goliath in both existing and new industry categories. With its massive size advantage, now is not the time to ease up on R&D. If it does, Alibaba will no longer be a technology giant and simply become a marketing company.

SoftBank's investment in Alibaba was so successful that Masayoshi Son would realize a $140 billion capital gain if he sold now. Could a similarly beautiful fledgling emerge from those Chinese nests?  Maybe not. Investors are starting to lose enthusiasm for some of what Alibaba and Tencent are buying, at least in the so-called \"new retail\" space.  Disappointed Better Life's shares tumbled after Tencent and its e-commerce partner JD.com bought strategic stakes. Source: Bloomberg  The latest example is Better Life Commercial Chain Share Co., with a market cap of $2.4 billion. This past weekend, the operator of supermarkets in China sold a 6 percent stake to Tencent in a 887 million-yuan ($141 million) transaction, and another 5 percent for 739 million yuan to Tencent's e-commerce partner JD.com Inc. Both deals were done at 17.11 yuan per share. But when Better Life resumed trading this week, its shares tumbled 8 percent in two days, against a broadly rising Shenzhen market.  The investor reaction when Alibaba bought 36 percent of Sun Art Retail Group Ltd. for $2.9 billion in November was muted, too.  Compare that with two years ago, when investors could hardly contain their excitement.  Suning.com Co., an electronics retailer, sold a 20 percent interest to Alibaba on Aug. 10, 2015, at 15.23 yuan per share -- a premium of only 5.8 percent to its average price the previous 20 trading days. That didn't stop Chinese investors pushing the stock up 40 percent in four days on speculation its backer would turn the store operator into a higher-margin, more valuable e-commerce proposition. Today, Suning is languishing at 12.37 yuan.  Perhaps people are finally realizing the tech giants may not have their affiliates' best interests at heart. Case in point: Last quarter, profits at Alibaba's \"equity investees\" (excluding Koubei Co., which helps people find restaurant deals) came in at only $105 million, not even 5 percent of the earnings at Jack Ma's flagship.  It may be that all Alibaba and Tencent want from their retail and logistics affiliates is data on shoppers and shippers. SmartKarma analyst Daniel Hellberg says that whether the startups perform well as financial investments \"is almost beside the point.\"  Indeed, stocks of Alibaba's own affiliates, including Alibaba Health Information Technology Ltd. and Alibaba Pictures Group, have underperformed the parent in the past year.

The latest splash is in food delivery. Alibaba plans to buy out Baidu Inc. and other investors in privately held startup Ele.me, Lulu Chen of Bloomberg News reported. Two years ago, Alibaba and Ant Financial invested $1.25 billion in the delivery company.

The deal implies an enterprise valuation of $9.5 billion for Ele.me, Alibaba said in a statement Monday, without saying how much it\u2019s paying. Alibaba and affiliate Ant Small and Micro Financial Services Group Co. already owned about 43 percent of the startup\u2019s voting shares. Alibaba paid all cash in the deal and has acquired all the shares formerly held by Baidu Inc., according to a person familiar with the matter.  Alibaba shares were down 2 percent to $179.88 at 10:17 a.m. in New York.  Ele.me -- which means \u201chungry yet?\u201d -- operates an army of delivery people on motorbikes across the country and is vying for supremacy in the local services industry with Meituan Dianping, a startup backed by Alibaba rival Tencent Holdings Ltd. The market is surging as people increasingly turn to their smartphones to order food, schedule beauty treatments and hire domestic helpers. It\u2019s also strategically important for Alibaba and Tencent as a means to promote their respective payment services.  \u201cAs one of the most frequently used applications, food delivery is the single most important entry point in the local services sector,\u201d Daniel Zhang, chief executive officer of Alibaba Group, said in an internal email to staff Monday. \u201cWe can already see that a vast, multi-dimensional local instant delivery network formed through a food delivery service will be an essential piece of the commerce infrastructure.\u201d  Bloomberg News reported in February on Alibaba\u2019s plans to buy out other investors in Ele.me. In a sign of the heated market, Meituan has become one of the most valuable startups in the world. The company is seeking to go public as soon as this year at a valuation of at least $60 billion, people familiar with the matter said last month.  Read more on Meituan and its plans for a $60 Billion IPO  The Ele.me deal is part of a broader foray by China\u2019s largest e-commerce company into logistics and brick-and-mortar assets. Alibaba is taking over longtime delivery affiliate Cainiao and putting money into warehouses. It has also made investments in traditional retailers, including department store chain Intime Retail Group Co. and China\u2019s largest operator of Walmart-style hypermarkets.  \"If the Ele.me distribution network is integrated with Cainiao it can become a more efficient asset and bring it to break-even quicker,\" said Kirk Boodry, an analyst with New Street Research.  Alibaba and Ant Financial were lagging behind Tencent and Meituan in terms of offline penetration, especially local services, said Counterpoint Research analyst Flora Tang.  \u201cOwnership of Ele.me is the fastest and most effective way for Alibaba to regain leadership position in this area to compete with Tencent,\u201d she said.  Baidu had ceded control of its own food-delivery unit to Ele.me last year as the startup and Meituan became the two biggest competitors in China\u2019s online food-delivery market.  Zhang Xuhao, Ele.me\u2019s founder, will become chairman of the company, while Wang Lei, vice president of Alibaba Group, will become chief executive officer of Ele.me, the company said.

Last month, the company said it would invest another $2 billion in Lazada Group SA to bolster its presence in Southeast Asia, where Amazon.com Inc. has launched in Singapore and Sea Ltd.\u2019s Shopee is expanding to win consumers.  The Ele.me deal may cut into profit margins in the short term, but Alibaba has demonstrated a willingness to make such acquisitions for gains in the future.

This is as true in India as it is in Silicon Valley. Then there\u2019s Bigbasket, whose founders are veterans of the dotcom bust and mostly north of 50. Drawing on their successes and failures, they\u2019ve turned their six-year-old startup into India\u2019s biggest e-grocer and are taking on a host of competitors, including Amazon and brick-and-mortar chains operated by the nation\u2019s biggest conglomerates.  Bangalore-based Bigbasket delivers everyday cooking essentials like ghee (clarified butter), diced coconut and fragrant basmati rice, as well as 18,000 other items from bread to laundry detergent to eight million customers in 25 Indian cities. It\u2019s mostly targeting upwardly mobile young Indians keen to avoid traffic and the drudgery of supermarket runs. Last month, Bigbasket raised $300 million in an Alibaba-led round that valued the grocer at $950 million\u2014 just shy of unicorn status.  In a country where groceries account for half of the almost $1 trillion retail market, Bigbasket is using knowledge learned the hard way during the dotcom era (don\u2019t expand too quickly or use discounts to acquire shoppers) and latter-day innovation (putting vending machines inside apartment buildings; building a supply chain of competitively priced organic produce).  Founding members of Bigbasket. From left: VS Ramesh, Hari Menon, Vipul Parekh, Abhinay Choudhari and V.S. Sudhakar. Photographer: Samyukta Lakshmi/Bloomberg  \u201cWe want customers to get hooked, and make our service harder to replicate,\u201d says Hari Menon, 56, co-founder and chief executive officer. He, along with V.S. Sudhakar (58), Vipul Parekh (53), Abhinay Choudhari (47) and VS Ramesh (62), founded Bigbasket parent Supermarket Grocery Supplies Pvt, in December 2011 in a nondescript building in Bangalore\u2019s humming Indiranagar neighborhood.  Bigbasket's founders had their first brush with e-commerce back in 1999 when they started Fabmart.com to sell books, toys and groceries online. \u201cThose were the dial-up days, there were no payment gateways, and the internet user base was more hype than reality,\u201d recalls co-founder Sudhakar, standing in a Bigbasket warehouse where women shake soil from mounds of vegetables before packing them into ready-to-ship bundles. \u201cBack then, it\u2019d take 50 seconds for a page to download.\u201d  It didn\u2019t take the men long to realize that the world\u2014let alone India\u2014wasn\u2019t quite ready for online shopping, and they pivoted to physical stores under the name Fabmall. They soon merged with a brick & mortar grocery chain before getting acquired by another conglomerate. By 2006, the founders had sold out and begun angel investing.  In 2011, they were approached to regroup for an online grocery. Plenty of people told them to stay away from perishable produce in a country so obsessed with freshness that shoppers surreptitiously break okra tips and sink their fingernails into cucumbers. The founders pressed on all the same.  But their timing was propitious: smartphones were proliferating, broadband was becoming affordable, and online payments were in place. Even so, when they pitched the concept, venture firms kept bringing up Webvan, the Bay Area e-grocer that famously flamed out in 2001. The founders revised their pitch to make clear that enough had changed to make the venture viable, and eventually persuaded private equity investor Ascent Capital to put up $10 million.  Workers stock shelves at a Bigbasket warehouse in Bengaluru. Photographer: Samyukta Lakshmi/Bloomberg  Delivering fresh food is challenging everywhere, but India presents steeper obstacles. The country lacks a cooling infrastructure\u2014walk-in freezers, chill rooms, refrigerated trucks and so on. That precluded Bigbasket from buying produce directly from farms. So for the first year, every morning at 3:30, the founders visited a riotous wholesale fruits and vegetable market to buy produce, then picked up other items from a wholesaler. Eventually, Bigbasket put together its own refrigerated warehouses and a fleet of trucks. These moves let the company source the food more cheaply and eventually in 2016 led them to launch Express, a 90-minute delivery service for milk, eggs, bread and emergency supplies.  By investing in \u201cthe dysfunctional food and grocery supply chain,\u201d says Arvind Singhal, chairman of retail consultancy Technopak Advisors, \u201cBigbasket\u2019s managed to get a head start.\u201d  Still, there was a lot of competition, including LocalBanya, Sequoia-backed PepperTap and SoftBank-funded Grofers. (Of them, only Grofers is still standing.) To stay ahead, Bigbasket needed to invest in technology: web-connected, temperature-controlled trucks, GPS-traceable vans, inventory-optimizing algorithms. \u201cThe days of experimenting were over,\u201d says Parekh. \u201cWe needed to step on the pedal.\u201d This all cost money and by then venture firms were more willing to invest. Starting in the fall of 2014, Bigbasket began mopping up capital\u2014$35 million from Helion Venture Partners and Zodius Capital Advisors, $15 million from Bessemer Venture Partners, $150 million in a round led by Dubai-based Abraaj Group. By mid-2016, Bigbasket was in eight large Indian cities.  Then it was time to target smaller cities. To grab the attention of residents in burgs like Kanpur, Surat and Vijayawada, they recruited Bollywood star Shahrukh Khan as a spokesman. In one TV commercial, Khan lets shocked delivery boys in through the back door. When asked if he's the one who orders the groceries, Khan lowers his voice conspiratorially and says, \u201cThat's my role in the house.\u201d When they ask for his autograph, he says, \u201cYou'll be coming home every week from here on. We'll take a selfie next time.\u201d  Along the way, Bigbasket has constantly had to adapt to local conditions. Originally the company wanted one person to drive the trucks and carry the orders into homes. But the delivery boys (they\u2019re mostly male) didn\u2019t want to be seen as drivers because they\u2019re considered lower status in class-conscious India. So they had to hire one person for each job\u2014which turned out to be crucial because parking is scarce so the driver needs to circle the neighborhood. They also need backup workers on standby because delivery people and packers have a tendency to take time off to celebrate local cultural events. \u201cIf there\u2019s a festival, 30 delivery guys take off to their village and return after four days,\u201d Sudhakar says.  Workers bag and weigh bananas and red peppers. Photographer: Samyukta Lakshmi/Bloomberg  Attracting and keeping customers is a challenge for all e-commerce companies, and doubly so in India. Shopping habits vary widely from city to city and are deeply ingrained. So Bigbasket plies customers with samples: leafy greens in Mumbai, a rice called Sona Masoori in Bangalore. The company spent years figuring out how to achieve the ideal ripeness of bananas for its picky customers and devised exacting quality specifications for produce, including eight varieties of eggplant, and trained the sourcing team to meet them.  Customized software automatically guides drivers to their destinations, which the company says has helped it achieve a near-perfect on-time rate. Late deliveries earn customers a 10 percent discount. Missing items are refunded, plus 50 percent of whatever the item cost.  Seven hundred people handle customer complaints and answer 95 percent of calls within the third ring, Bigbasket says. Complaints range from missing items to delivery boys\u2019 hygiene. After getting one too many of these complaints, the founders mandated that their personnel wear clean shirts and open-toe sandals to suit the humid weather. \u201cA Bigbasket person visits a household an average 50 times a year so being presentable was supreme,\u201d Menon says.  A worker prepares a barcode sticker for a customer's order. Photographer: Samyukta Lakshmi/Bloomberg  Last year, the founders took stock of what they had achieved. Bigbasket was now in cities with a combined population of 150 million people, had good brand recall and was making money on each order. But, \u201cwe\u2019d barely scratched the surface of the cities we were already in,\u201d Menon says. \u201cIt was time to bring in a strategic partner.\u201d After initial conversations with Amazon, Walmart and others, the founders zeroed in on Alibaba, which runs a large online grocery business in China and has built its own delivery operations.  They\u2019re now preparing for the next phase of growth by plowing money into warehousing and delivery systems in the 25 cities to bring down delivery times to three hours. In two years, the plan is to double the range of products to 60,000 SKUs, and more than double the farmer base to 5,000, expand private label items and use Alibaba\u2019s muscle to source and import a range of merchandise to six times that of large-format supermarkets. \u201cA customer should be able to buy whatever he wants,\u201d Menon says.  Even as Amazon and local rival Flipkart push into groceries, Bigbasket\u2019s founders profess equanimity. Grocery is different from electronics or fashion and they\u2019re confident that strength in one category doesn\u2019t necessarily translate to another.Bigbasket is growing quickly and aims to double sales each year to hit $2 billion by 2020 to take the third spot in Indian retail. \u201cThey\u2019ve just gone past 100 meters in a 42-kilometer marathon,\u201d said Vishal Gupta, managing director of early investor Bessemer. \u201cThey have to hit the top spot and keep on running.\u201d", "stock": "BABA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-19", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-19/alibaba-backed-grocery-startup-battles-amazon-in-india"}, {"article": "Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. will invest another $2 billion in Lazada Group SA and install one of its most senior executives to run the business as it doubles its bet on Southeast Asia.

Morgan Stanley, Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. were among at least 10 banks that helped to make the so-called margin loan, which is guaranteed only by Softbank\u2019s Alibaba holding, said the people, who requested anonymity as the details aren\u2019t public. The deal won\u2019t be reflected in the Tokyo-based company\u2019s debt, which may help shield it from a ratings downgrade, and could help its plans to sell shares in a domestic subsidiary, the people said.  The participation of the world\u2019s biggest banks in the trade reflects their continued appetite for complex share-based trades linked to their most-prized clients even after banks lost more than $1 billion combined on a margin loan linked to Steinhoff International Holdings NV. The South African retailer has lost more than 90 percent of its market value following disclosures of accounting errors that dated back several years.  \u201cTo my knowledge, I would agree that $8 billion is the largest margin loan ever,\u201d said Bethany Knight, a former Deutsche Bank executive who now advises on equity derivatives at Riverside Risk Advisors LLC in New York. \u201cThere are only a handful of sizable margin loans due to the significant ownership stake needed in a large, liquid, public company.\u201d  SoftBank couldn\u2019t immediately be reached for comment. Shares in Alibaba fell 2.2 percent to $168.86 at 12.25 p.m. in New York.  BNP Paribas SA, Deutsche Bank AG, Nomura Holdings Inc., Societe Generale SA, UBS Group AG and ING Groep NV were among other lenders on the deal, the people said. Representatives for the banks either declined to comment or didn\u2019t return calls and emails.  The margin loan\u2019s interest rate is the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, plus about 150 basis points, or 1.5 percent, two of the people said. Softbank sold $2 billion of 10-year bonds last year that had a yield of 5.7 percent in London.  The margin loan may also remove an obstacle to the initial public offering of its domestic telecommunications unit SoftBank Corp., which had been used as collateral for its earlier debt, one of the people said. A successful IPO -- possible only after the division proves its independence by canceling debt guarantees -- could help the parent raise capital and relieve some of its debt burden, which reached 15.8 trillion yen ($147 billion) at the end of last year. A Tokyo listing could raise more than 2 trillion yen, people with knowledge of the matter said this year.  Masayoshi Son Photographer: Akio Kon/Bloomberg  Billionaire founder Masayoshi Son, who has said he aims for a listing within a year, is seeking to separate SoftBank\u2019s activities into investing and telecommunications arms as it branches out into businesses ranging from ride-hailing to insurance.  SoftBank Group\u2019s debt risk last month jumped to the highest in almost two years following a successful exchange of its dollar- and euro-denominated bonds for new securities, allowing the mobile-phone unit to release its loan guarantee. That swap eases the way for the IPO, prompting concern among bondholders that the unit\u2019s listing may reduce the amount of cash flow for the parent company.  In a margin loan, a borrower secures the debt by pledging an asset with the understanding that they\u2019d need to pay up if the value of the collateral declines.

Ant has produced a 13.2 billion yuan ($2.1 billion) profit over the past year, according to Bloomberg Gadfly calculations.  Steady On Ant Financial's profit has risen, but not steadily Source: Alibaba filings  Alibaba was able to grow into its valuation unimpeded, thanks to robust expansion of China's consumer sector and the rise of e-commerce. Three-and-a-half years later, it has a market cap of $454 billion. For Ant to follow the same trajectory it'll need to keep going deeper into the financial and personal lives of Chinese citizens, finding more ways to extract value in the form of commissions, fees or data.  Facebook Inc.'s Mark Zuckerberg was just schooled on the political risks of mishandling user information. And while China may view data privacy differently to the U.S., it would be a mistake to think the government takes a laissez-faire approach.  As fellow Gadfly Shuli Ren has pointed out, Ant faces numerous regulatory headwinds that cast doubt on the inevitability of any IPO. Competition, notably from Tencent Holdings Ltd., has also hurt, and contributed to a 90 percent drop in earnings in the December quarter after Ant spent big to lure new Alipay wallet users.  Unstable Ant Financial's earnings have been very up and down Source: Alibaba, Bloomberg Gadfly  Providing payments, credit scores and loans is also a more sensitive caper than selling toilet paper and televisions, which makes the very visible hand of the Chinese government one of Ant's biggest risks. There are several ways in which the People's Bank of China has rained on Ant's parade.  Even if Ant's profit rebounds, investors would be remiss to ignore these instabilities. Tencent provides stiffer competition to Ant than Alibaba ever faced as an e-commerce player in its pre-IPO days. And there are many other fintech firms ready to eat away at both giants.

To be the first to know, please click here.  Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba upgraded the AI platform powering its Tmall Genie X1 smart speaker to include visual recognition capabilities, according to Ciol.  The AI platform, dubbed AliGenie 2.0, offers visual recognition capabilities via \"Genie FireEye,\" a new function in the Tmall Genie's mobile app. Consumers can attach their phones to a phone holder, called the \"Xholder,\" that's connected to the smart speaker, and then use their phone camera to scan items, which the device will recognize. It will then read aloud information associated with those items.  A robust AI platform with visual recognition capabilities could help Alibaba continue to grow its share of the global smart speaker market. Alibaba released the Tmall Genie X1 exclusively for the Chinese market in July 2017. It then captured 2.6% of the global smart speaker market in Q4 2017, making it the third-largest smart speaker vendor after Amazon and Google in terms of shipments, according to Strategy Analytics. The smart speaker is also the top-selling voice-controlled smart speaker in China, with 2 million units shipped since its release, and it's been connected to over 45 million smart home devices.  Bringing visual recognition to the Tmall Genie X1 is key to Alibaba's approach to the market. Alibaba is looking into retail, travel, and especially hospitality as areas for smart speaker growth, while its competitors are primarily focused on securing a place in the home for their smart speakers. With the new visual function, the Tmall Genie X1 will be able to scan and read over 40,000 medicine boxes, which could be crucial for individuals with visual impairments.  The device will also be capable of scanning book covers, and can currently read aloud over 117 books by Chinese publishers. Additionally, the Tmall Genie X1 will be able to interact with consumers through more than 20 simulated animations and facial expressions, allowing its users to enjoy an immersive experience that includes voice, visual, and touch interaction. Alibaba reportedly plans to implement facial recognition capabilities in a separate rollout to make the speaker even more engaging.  The addition of visual recognition to smart speakers marks the next logical step for vendors looking to expand use cases. The creation of new and immersive experiences with the addition of visual functions presents new avenues for businesses to interact with consumers, and will likely boost user engagement as a result. Visual interactive elements can also help businesses leveraging smart speakers to find new monetization structures, like visual-based advertisements and app subscriptions that are based on higher quality and more interactive experiences.", "stock": "BABA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-27", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/alibaba-adds-visual-recognition-to-its-smart-speaker-2018-3"}, {"article": "Ruben Sprich/Reuters  There's speculation that Alibaba is looking to buy out the remaining stake of Ele.me, its food delivery unit.

Alibaba's planned takeover could make it one side of a powerful duopoly in China. Ele.me makes up 50% of China's online food delivery market while rival Meituan controls 43.5%, according to Analysys International.

China has seen online grocery growth soar because it has a higher population density, lower labor cost, a fragmented food and beverage market due to the higher number of small mom-and-pop shops with no logistics capacity, and a \"well-formed consumer habit\" thanks to subsidies, Chan said.  The acquisition of Ele.me could create synergies for Alibaba to move beyond food delivery, Chan added. It could help expand Alibaba's cross-channel traffic acquisition, Alipay's scale from loyal or high-frequency users, and \"strengthen\" its last-mile delivery under its \"New Retail\" initiatives, which the company hopes will further imbue brick-and-mortar stores with technology and e-commerce.

Kroger  Brittain Ladd, a Kroger consultant, wrote about the possibility of a Kroger-Alibaba partnership in a LinkedIn post published in June.  \"I believe Alibaba should acquire Kroger as a way to enter the USA, as well as extend and complement their global retail ecosystem,\" he wrote. \"A combined Kroger and Alibaba would prove to be Kryptonite to Amazon Whole Foods and Walmart/Jet.com, while adding substantial value to Kroger customers.\"  In the LinkedIn post, Ladd suggested that Kroger could license Alipay or launch Alibaba's Hema supermarkets in the US. Hema markets are similar to Amazon's cashier-less Amazon Go stores.  Kroger has been working on adding more digital features to its stores. The grocery chain is rolling out a new service called Scan, Bag, Go to 400 stores. It's designed to enable shoppers to scan their groceries with mobile phones or other handheld devices while they shop.  Eventually, Kroger says, the technology will also allow customers to pay for the items with their phones \u2014 which is where Alipay could come in.  Kroger says it also plans to add digital-shelf technology to nearly 200 stores this year. The technology, called Kroger Edge, is designed to replace paper price tags with digital displays showing a product's price and nutritional information, as well as video ads and coupons.", "stock": "BABA", "label": 1, "date": "2018-01-25", "source": "business-insider", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/a-kroger-alibaba-deal-could-thwart-amazons-whole-foods-ambitions-2018-1"}, {"article": "Alibaba  Alibaba is expanding Hema, a chain of cashless supermarkets.

Gideon Mendel/Corbis via Getty Images  Taobao, the Alibaba-backed online retailer, has launched a customized version of its app for elderly users.  China has 255 million people aged over 60, a largely untapped market potentially worth billions in revenue.  The company recently began recruiting for two elderly workers to improve its app for older users.  Nestle, IBM, and Apple have all begun targeting older consumers in China and Japan.  While most companies are still figuring out how to capture the millennial market, Taobao, the Alibaba-backed online retailer, has its focus set on China's growing population of senior citizens.  Last week the company launched an \"elderly-friendly\" version of its app that the company hopes will capture the attention of aging Chinese. There are currently 222 million people aged over 60 in China and, by 2020, that number is expected to hit 255 million\u2014 almost 20% of the country's population.  To gain access to this growing consumer base,Taobao's customized app is designed to be easier for older shoppers to use and can link straight to their children's account who have the \"pay-for-me\" option if they are inclined to cover their parents' purchase costs.  The customized app also displays a photo of their child on every page so users can easily share products or start a conversation via phone or text. Italso has a larger, less crowded interface, and uses more shortcuts for navigation.  \"By launching this simple and user-friendly option for the Taobao App, we will make online shopping easier for our senior citizens and help them stay connected with the younger generation and the community,\" said Ding Jian, Senior Product Manager at Taobao, who heads the development of this new channel, said in a statement emailed to Business Insider.  It's a sound financial move by Alibaba.  Last year, according to Taobao, shoppers over age 50 in China bought, on average, 44 products spending nearly $800 shopping online. Accounting for just senior citizens over 60 puts a possible total spend at around $200 billion a year.  Currently, Taobao has just 6 million users aged 60 to 69.Last month it began recruiting for two employees aged 60 or over who will work to get feedback from elderly users to improve the customized app.  But the company isn't alone in trying to tap the \"silver economy.\"  After Nestle previously launched a milk line for Chinese drinkers over age 50 and in Japan, where senior citizens account for more than a quarter of the population, Apple and IBM developed a modified iPad for the elderly which also had larger text, simpler interfaces and a modified FaceTime to easily speak to family.", "stock": "BABA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-06", "source": "business-insider", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/alibaba-targets-senior-citizen-consumers-2018-2"}, {"article": "As expected since February, Alibaba will buy all outstanding shares of Ele.me that it doesn\u2019t already own.

Alibaba, which first invested in Ele.me two years ago, and its affiliate Ant Small and Micro Financial Services Group currently hold about 43% of the company\u2019s outstanding voting shares.  This is the latest in a string of investments and acquisitions by Alibaba to expand its physical retail presence as part of its so-called \u201cnew retail\u201d strategy to combine e-commerce and offline retail.

Ele.me, which will continue to operate under its own brand, is at its heart a logistics technology company.

Alibaba is in the early stages of making an investment in Grab, two sources with knowledge of discussions told TechCrunch. Isn\u2019t yet clear what size that might be or at what valuation for Grab, which was last valued by investors at $6 billion.  In addition, the timing is unclear due to current anti-trust investigations into the Grab-Uber deal. The Competition Commission of Singapore has said there are grounds to believe the merger may violate the law, while other countries are looking into its implications. But still, there is intent from both sides and key investor SoftBank to make the deal.  Grab declined to comment for this story. An Alibaba spokesperson said the company \u201cdoesn\u2019t confirm on market rumors.\u201d  Alibaba and Grab first held talks over an investment last summer but a deal never materialized after the Chinese firm became pre-occupied chasing an investment in Tokopedia, the Indonesia-based e-commerce unicorn. That deal was prioritized because Alibaba\u2019s arch-rival Tencent was in advanced talks over an investment that could give it a foothold in Indonesia, Southeast Asia\u2019s largest economy and the world\u2019s fourth most populous country.  Alibaba leaned heavily on its long-time ally SoftBank \u2014 an early backer of Tokopedia and Grab \u2014 to get the Tokopedia deal ahead of Tencent. That\u2019s despite Tokopedia\u2019s own founders\u2019 preference for Tencent due to Alibaba\u2019s ownership of Lazada, an e-commerce rival to Tokopedia. SoftBank, however, forced the deal through.  \u201cIt was literally SoftBank against every other investor,\u201d a separate source with knowledge of negotiations told TechCrunch.  Ultimately, Alibaba was successful and it led a $1.1 billion investment in Tokopedia in August which did not include Tencent.  TechCrunch understands that one condition SoftBank attached to the Tokopedia deal was that Alibaba would invest in Grab when the time was right. SoftBank is widely seen to have been the deal-maker in the recent Grab-Uber consolidation and now, with that transaction agreed, Alibaba\u2019s investment will follow.  The timing may be ideal for Grab. While it has plenty of money in the bank from past investments, Indonesian rival Go-Jek is preparing to expand into regional markets so the firm will need to brace itself for a new wave of competition.  Despite the background, this is far from Alibaba being strong-armed into an investment, a deal with Grab makes plenty of sense for the firm.  It has been actively seeking investment deals in Southeast Asia\u2019s top internet companies for some time, and Grab clearly fits the bill. In particular, Grab\u2019s focus on payments and its recently announced financial services play is aligned with Alibaba and its fintech arm Ant Financial\u2019s goals, too.  Last year, Ant Financial went on an investment spree which included multiple investments deals across Southeast Asia and the failed acquisition of MoneyGram. Involvement in Grab Pay, which is shaping up to be a major payment player across the region, would massively boost Alibaba and Ant\u2019s objective.  Finally, there\u2019s the good old competition factor. With Tencent an investor in Grab rival Go-Jek, Alibaba has motivation enough to back a horse in Southeast Asia\u2019s ride-hailing space.  As I wrote last year, the two Chinese internet giants have been carving up Southeast Asia\u2019s most promising startups in search of investments that give them a good position as the region\u2019s internet economy grows.  A report co-authored by Google last year forecast that Southeast Asia\u2019s internet economy will grow to $200 billion in 2025 from $50 billion in 2017. Right now, it is Chinese companies, not those from the U.S., that are seizing the opportunity.  Got a news tip?

Alibaba\u2019s first investment came in April 2016 when it bought 51 percent of Lazada for $1 billion, and it added another $1 billion last summer to increase its equity to around 83 percent. With today\u2019s news, Alibaba has invested $4 billion to date which it said will \u201caccelerate the growth plans\u201d and help further tie the Lazada business into Alibaba\u2019s core e-commerce service.  There\u2019s already been plenty of evidence of increased ties between Alibaba and Lazada. The latter began offering products from Alibaba\u2019s Taobao marketplace across Southeast Asia last year, and Alibaba has replaced Lazada\u2019s tech team leadership with executives of its own. The latest shakeup is the appointment of Lucy Peng as Lazada\u2019s new CEO to replace Max Bittner, who was installed by former owner Rocket Internet back in 2012.

TechCrunch has confirmed that with sources close to Alibaba, who told us that a proposal to buy the remaining stakes was submitted to investors yesterday.  Alibaba first invested in Ele.me in 2016 and it doubled down to lead a $1 billion investment last year. Ele.me consolidated its position as one of China\u2019s largest food on-demand platforms when it picked up Baidu\u2019s rival business back in August, which explains how Baidu became an investor.  The acquisition could value Ele.me at as much a $9.5 billion, according to Bloomberg, and the deal would be significant since it would once again pit Alibaba against its key rival Tencent.  While Alibaba\u2019s core business is e-commerce and Tencent\u2019s is online content and messaging, the two have overlapped into a myriad of verticals, each time coming up against each other either through startups they have invested in or independent business unit they own.  Tencent tends to favor the investment approach while Alibaba has bought businesses outright \u2014 including Weibo, Youku Tudou and UC Web.  In the food delivery case, Tencent\u2019s horse is Meituan Dianping, the local services business formed when China\u2019s two largest on-demand platforms came together via a 2015 merger. To add additional complication to that, Alibaba and Tencent briefly both held stakes in the merged entity since Alibaba backed Meituan and Tencent previously put money into Dianping. Alibaba moved to sell its share of Meituan Dianping in early 2017, leaving it free to double down on Ele.me as it did last year.  Assuming Alibaba is successful with its latest offer, Ele.me will form part of its \u2018new retail\u2019 push that\u2019s designed to combine the best of e-commerce with offline retail.

The fact that smaller players continue to struggle in the cloud market isn\u2019t that surprising, but it makes Alibaba\u2019s rapid rise all the more remarkable. That Alibaba has shown up at all is a testimony to how fast it has grown.

That didn\u2019t seem like enough at the time, but it has taken some big leaps to get to this point so quickly.  While the majority of its business is in China and Asia more broadly, that is a huge market and gives Alibaba enough lift to grow fast and move up in the market more quickly. In another report from Synergy published last year, it found to no one\u2019s surprise that the Chinese cloud market was dominated by Chinese cloud companies. Alibaba was at the top of the cloud services market tier, which wasn\u2019t the most lucrative, but was the fastest growing.  For Alibaba to really expand its share and move up the graph, it probably needs to build a bigger market in the west, particularly in the US. It currently runs 14 data centers worldwide with just two in the US, one in Silicon Valley and one in Virginia. It is expanding rapidly with plans to build several new data centers in China, Malaysia, India and Indonesia.  For Alibaba, the explosive growth numbers are positive news, but it still remains far behind market leader AWS and other big players like Microsoft, IBM and Google.

JD.com confirmed it will remain the majority shareholder with a stake of 81.4 percent.

China\u2019s tech giants like Alibaba and Tencent are some of the most valuable in the world, and upcoming potential IPOs by the next generation of startups like Xiaomi are causes for celebration. Most Chinese citizens would be thrilled, however, there is a deep irony behind their success. These Chinese tech companies can actually not be purchased on a Chinese stock exchange, nor can Chinese retail investors buy a share in them.  Chinese workers build these companies up, and the value accretes to American capitalists (\u201cSocialism with Chinese Characteristics,\u201d I guess?)  Now, the central government is proposing new rules that would allow these companies to come back to the mainland through the use of Chinese Depositary Receipts, or CDRs. That\u2019s big news, and could completely transform not only the market caps of some of the largest tech companies in the world, but also increase competition between trading houses like the New York Stock Exchange and Chinese stock exchanges in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Shenzhen.  WTF is a CDR then? Before we get to that, we first need to understand why they are needed in the first place.  Domestic buyers buying domestic stocks is really, really hard in China  In economics theory, stock exchanges are epitomized as a shining exemplar of the notions of free trade and efficient markets. Each company is selling a standard unit (a share), prices are transparently disclosed and buyers and sellers can connect in a central market (an exchange) to buy and sell their securities at voluntary prices.  In reality of course, governments strongly regulate financial securities to ensure that those exchanges are well-ordered. The Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States is just one of several public and private bodies that regulate the conduct and operation of the nation\u2019s exchanges.  Now up that regulation by 100x when you enter China. Listing on a stock exchange must be approved by the central government, and regulators have been aggressive in blocking listings over the past few years. Due to robust capital controls, Chinese citizens may only buy local securities, and can\u2019t invest in companies outside of China through foreign stock exchanges. Likewise, foreign investors face daunting challenges in investing in local companies, even with liberalization programs over the last two decades. The government regularly intervenes in the operation of the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges through trade freezes and other machinations. Local securities regulations can be highly burdensome, and force companies to engage in \u201cparty building\u201d activities.  For Chinese companies looking to raise capital from private investors, there are two paths forward. One is to offer multiple types of shares traded in different places. Classically, this has meant an \u201cA-share\u201d that was traded in say Shanghai and only available for purchase by locals, and a \u201cB-share\u201d that was only available to foreigners. Some companies chose to have an \u201cH-share,\u201d which was listed in Hong Kong, which has none of the securities regulations of domestic Chinese exchanges. These different classes of shares are priced independently, and there can be wide discrepancies between them (A-shares have traditionally had massive premiums compared to other share types, and researchers still don\u2019t know exactly why).  This path is convoluted, so large Chinese companies \u2014 including Alibaba and Tencent \u2014 are often incorporated in places like the Cayman Islands to avoid domestic securities requirements, while also giving them access to foreign capital markets. According to an analysis by offshore incorporation specialist law firm Walkers, nearly half of all Hong Kong-listed stocks are based in the Cayman Islands, with another quarter based in Bermuda. That is financially prudent for executives, but deeply unpopular with Chinese authorities, which both loses corporate control and also loses the future growth that these stocks attain when they list on a foreign exchange.  WTF is a CDR?  That\u2019s where Chinese Depositary Receipts (CDRs) come in. Modeled after American Depositary Receipts, which were invented almost a century ago, CDRs are a way for local buyers to own foreign shares in a way that both fits within local securities regulations and reduces friction in the trading process.  A bank acts as a middleman broker between a foreign issuer and local buyers. This institution, known as the depositary, holds foreign shares of companies in trust, and then offers a new security to the local market linked to those deposited shares by a ratio (say one receipt per six shares). We now have two securities: the receipt, held by a shareholder which is connected to a depositary bank, and the original foreign share, which is held by the bank on behalf of a foreign issuer.  This is where the \u201cmagic\u201d happens: Securities regulations apply to the new security targeting local buyers, and not to the shares of the original company (massive asterisk here since the reality is thousands of pages of policies and laws, but this is the general idea). By intermediating the transaction, everyone can win: Local buyers get access to foreign investments, while also still coming under the purview of domestic regulations.  It\u2019s important to note that there are a bunch of peculiarities that I don\u2019t want to dive too much into. There are more fees than standard shares in order to pay for custody of the shares and the trading logistics to maintain them. There are tax implications and other accounting issues that can be quite complex depending on the investor.  Despite such complications though, depositary receipts are quite popular in the United States. The market in 2016 was worth an estimated $2.9 trillion, with roughly 3,500 such securities available to be traded, and dozens more launched that year, according to BNY Mellon, which is among the largest depositary bank institutions in the country. Given that the Chinese economy is already larger than America\u2019s today by some economic measures, the scale of a CDR market could well pass a trillion dollars.  Share the wealth at home  The concept behind depositary receipts may not be new, but their use in China has not previously been formalized, and that is liable to change now. This past Friday, the central government circulated a draft policy of new securities regulations that would allow for Chinese Depositary Receipts to be issued on local stock exchanges.  According to China Banking News, tech companies look like the major focus here. \u201cThe Opinions will allow some tech companies or enterprises in strategic emerging industries to perform listing via the issuance of either shares or depository receipts, with a focus on sectors including big data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, software, integrated circuits, high-end manufacturing and bio-tech.\u201d That focus on technology would match other initiatives of the Chinese Communist Party, namely the country\u2019s roadmap for technological dominance, known as Made in China 2025.  Once the CDR mechanism is in place, Chinese companies listed overseas are expected to face significant pressure to utilize it and open up their ownership to local buyers. Already, companies like Baidu, Sogou, Alibaba, Tencent and Xiaomi have said publicly that they are interested in finding a channel to return to the mainland (or in the case of Xiaomi, to potentially launch its initial offering at least partially there). As Bloomberg wrote a month ago, \u201cEnticing mega-corporations to list locally will help burnish the reputation of China\u2019s twin bourses in Shanghai and Shenzhen, notorious for spotty regulation, volatility and periodic government intervention.\u201d  Furthermore, having more domestic Chinese shareholders ensures that corporate control of these local companies stays in Chinese hands. The Chinese Communist Party has been particularly aggressive on this front, proposing taking a point of equity in top firms and potentially installing party cadres on corporate boards. Changing the shareholder structure of these firms then should be seen as an extension of control by the party into the private sector.  While the changes are still being promulgated, we should be prepared for large changes in the ways that companies \u2014 particularly those in the technology sector \u2014 are capitalized. Alibaba and Tencent\u2019s combined market cap is nearly a trillion dollars. There are dozens of other Chinese stocks listed exclusively in U.S. and Western exchanges, so if CDRs become popular, it could be a massive market.

As businesses and governments around the world look for ways to skirt the traditional news media, The Post has become a test case for how a new owner can co-opt an established brand to promote certain viewpoints. Alibaba executives say they want to present a \u201cfair and balanced\u201d alternative to foreign media, a mission statement that echoes Fox News.  Gary Liu, a Harvard-educated technology entrepreneur who is The Post\u2019s chief executive, said the newspaper could offer a more nuanced portrait of China than Western news outlets, with a staff of 350 journalists in Asia, including about 40 in the mainland.  \u201cWe are not here, certainly, to promote the views and wishes of Beijing,\u201d said Mr. Liu, who was previously chief executive of Digg, a news aggregation site in New York.

Last year, The Post retracted a business column that suggested an investor in Hong Kong had ties to a trusted adviser to President Xi Jinping and had used his connections to amass wealth. The editors said the column made \u201cinsinuations beyond the facts.\u201d  Its author, Shirley Yam, a well-respected financial commentator, resigned. In a statement, Ms. Yam defended her column, saying that editors had vetted the piece extensively before its publication.

Mr. Gui was then quoted saying he had broken Chinese law and did not want help from the outside world. In its coverage, The Post said that the interview with Mr. Gui was \u201cgovernment-arranged.\u201d  \u201cThe Post risks being a vehicle in Beijing\u2019s overall propaganda machinery,\u201d said Willy Wo-Lap Lam, a scholar at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and a former Post journalist.

Articles mentioning Alibaba reached an average of about 3.5 per day last year online and in print, roughly double the number in 2016, according to an archival search.

Traffic to The Post\u2019s website has roughly tripled over the past year, the company said. Alibaba made access free when it took over.  But Alibaba has abandoned ambitions of expanding the audience for The Post\u2019s journalism in the mainland, where its website is blocked. Even with its pro-China mission, articles in The Post still touch on topics that are off limits to mainland readers, like the 1989 Tiananmen massacre.

Although the alliance is still in the early stages, it could create online services for medical advice or use its overall heft to negotiate for lower drug prices.  \u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that across the board, the Chinese tech companies have all embraced being involved in and being active in the health care space, unlike the U.S., where some of them have and some have not,\u201d said Laura Nelson Carney, an Asia-Pacific health care analyst at Bernstein Research.  Photo  \u201cFew of them have made moves as big as in China,\u201d Ms. Carney said, referring to Alibaba and Tencent\u2019s American rivals.  Those big moves have had varying degrees of success.  In 2014, Alibaba announced a \u201cfuture hospital\u201d plan intended to make treatment more efficient by allowing patients to consult with doctors online and order drugs via the internet. But two years later, Chinese regulators stopped the sale of over-the-counter drugs on Tmall, Alibaba\u2019s e-commerce website. They also suspended a drug-monitoring system that the company had created. And last year, the search engine company Baidu scrapped its internet health care service, which allowed patients to book doctors appointments through an app, in a bid to focus solely on A.I.  But some of the more recent initiatives have made inroads. Last year, Alibaba\u2019s health unit introduced A.I. software that can help interpret CT scans and an A.I. medical lab to help doctors make diagnoses. About a month later, Tencent unveiled Miying, a medical imaging program that helps doctors detect early signs of cancer, in the southwestern region of Guangxi. It is now used in nearly 100 hospitals across China.  Tencent has also invested in WeDoctor Group, which has opened its own take on Alibaba\u2019s \u201cfuture hospital\u201d in northwestern China. The service allows patients to video chat with doctors and fill their prescriptions online.

Dr. Yu Weihong, an ophthalmologist at Peking Union Medical College Hospital, said she used to take up to two days to analyze a patient\u2019s eyes by scrutinizing grainy images before discussing her findings with colleagues and writing up a report. Artificial intelligence software currently being tested by the hospital helps her do all that dramatically faster.

The software has been developed by VoxelCloud, a start-up has raised about $28.5 million from companies including Tencent and the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Sequoia Capital. It specializes in automated medical image analysis, helping eye doctors like Dr. Yu screen patients for diabetic retinopathy, the leading cause of blindness among China\u2019s working-age population.  There are just 20 eye doctors for every million people here, a third of the proportion in the United States. In April, Beijing announced an ambitious plan for the country\u2019s 110 million diabetics to undergo eye tests.  \u201cIt\u2019s impossible for one person to read that many images,\u201d said Dr. Yu.  Ding Xiaowei, whose grandparents were doctors, founded VoxelCloud in 2016, three months after completing his doctorate in computer science at U.C.L.A. The company, which has offices in Los Angeles and the Chinese cities of Shanghai and Suzhou, is awaiting the green light from China\u2019s version of the F.D.A. for five diagnostic tools for CT scans and retina disease.  Photo  The sheer size of China\u2019s population \u2014 nearly 1.4 billion people who could provide a vast number of images to feed into their systems \u2014 provides a potential advantage for the development of artificial intelligence. Also helping: China has fewer concerns about privacy, allowing for easier collection of data that could result in smarter and more efficient A.I. systems. Regulation here isn\u2019t as strict as in the United States, either.  In all, more than 130 companies are applying A.I. in ways that could increase the efficiency of China\u2019s health care system, according to Yiou Intelligence, an industry consultancy based in Beijing. They range from behemoths like Alibaba and Tencent to domestic champions iFlyTek, which invented a robot that passed a Chinese medical licensing exam, and an array of smaller start-ups.  Money is flowing in. As of last August, venture capitalists such as Sequoia and Matrix Partners had invested at least $2.7 billion in such businesses, according to Yiou. Analysts at Bernstein estimated that spending in China\u2019s health tech industry will reach $150 billion by 2020.  Behind this push is a realization that the country\u2019s health care system is in crisis. With no functioning primary care system, patients flock to hospitals in major cities, sometimes camping out overnight just to get treatment for a fever. Doctors are overworked, and reports of stabbings and assaults by frustrated patients and their relatives are not uncommon.

Yitu is working with Zhejiang Provincial People\u2019s Hospital, the best medical facility in eastern Zhejiang province, to develop software that automates the identification of early stages of lung cancer.  While it initially focused on facial recognition, Yitu has branched out into more complex image-recognition challenges, like cancer scans. Lin Chenxi, who left Alibaba to establish the company in 2012, said he hoped to use the technology to ensure equal access to medical treatment across China.  \u201cIn China, medical resources are very scarce and unequally distributed so that the top resources are concentrated in provincial capitals,\u201d he said. \u201cWith this system, if it can be used at hospitals in rural cities, then it will make the medical experience much better.\u201d  Trying to identify cancer nodes \u2014 shifting black-and-white splotches that look something like a Rorschach test \u2014 is grueling work, and China\u2019s doctors have far less time and resources than their counterparts in the United States and elsewhere. Gong Xiangyang, the head of the hospital\u2019s radiology department, likened the process to a factory, where burnout and mistakes from overwork can happen.  \u201cWe have to deal with a vast amount of medical images everyday,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we welcome technology if it can relieve the pressure while boosting efficiency and accuracy.\u201d", "stock": "BABA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-01-31", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/31/technology/amazon-china-health-care-ai.html"}, {"article": "Alibaba and Data  E-commerce was both an aspiration and a boogeyman. Amazon was often described in hushed tones; several exhibitors and speakers tried to avoid naming the online retailer at all.  But attendees packed a large hall on Tuesday to listen to an executive of Alibaba, a Chinese giant that many consider to be Amazon\u2019s chief rival, describe how Asian consumers are eager to make purchases enabled by technology.  China \u201cmay well become the first cashless society in the future,\u201d said Lee McCabe, vice president of Alibaba\u2019s North America operations. Shoppers in China largely accept Alibaba\u2019s voracious data collection, which allows the company to create detailed behavioral profiles across its many platforms.  Alibaba uses the information to help guide American brands like Mattel into China, Mr. McCabe said. To promote movies like \u201cA Dog\u2019s Purpose\u201d to an Asian audience, Alibaba \u201ctargeted everybody who likes Dennis Quaid movies, who likes dogs, who has watched a dog video\u201d using its vast trove of data, he said.  Artificial intelligence also plays heavily into Alibaba\u2019s strategy and is used to predict supply chain volatility and personalize marketing. It also handles 95 percent of the inquiries the company receives from its customers. The system recognizes when shoppers become emotional and should be transferred to a human representative, Mr. McCabe said.  Certain consumers will soon be able to test-drive or purchase vehicles without any human contact, using their mobile phones at a garage that doubles as a vending machine, he said. Alibaba will have reviewed their credit scores and deemed them able to afford a car.

Many companies are experimenting with new tactics, including showrooms and pickup services. Alex Taussig, a partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners, called this experimentation the \u201creplatforming of retail.\u201d  \u201cThis is all rethinking what it means to have a store, and this is why I think the retail apocalypse is not evenly distributed,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are certain formats that will go away.\u201d  Consumers in Control  Shoppers \u201cused to be passive individuals in front of a shelf,\u201d Laurence Haziot, a global managing director at IBM, said during another panel.

Moreover, the issue implicates gender equality and gender diversity concerns more broadly, and boards that include a meaningful proportion of female directors should be better positioned to address sexual harassment and gender equality issues.  Among the best ways to better address the issue at a company: having more women on corporate boards and in senior management positions.  \u2014 Michael J. de la Merced  The race is on to become the first United States company valued at $1 trillion.

A scary U.S. inflation print in February sent shares sliding and raised fears of four, rather than three, interest rate rises in 2018. Since then though, inflation has failed to spook markets the same way; worries about trade and Big Tech regulation have instead come to the fore. Next week, with U.S. CPI data due, markets may find themselves back thinking about price rises and wondering if those February fears were justified.  There is no sign yet of those fears resurfacing. Latest jobs data showed the United States created the fewest jobs in six months, even if higher wage gains signalled tight labour markets. Bond markets' inflation expectations gauge -- 10-year inflation breakeven rates -- extended a recent drop.  CPI next week is expected to be up 0.2 percent, the same as its as-consensus rise in February. That could soothe volatile stocks -- if earnings hold up and trade tensions abate.

Next week's March trade data from China will probably show the economy extending its impressive run-up in exports: it's too early to see any impact from the tit-for-tat tariff salvos the Trump administration and Beijing have been firing off in recent days. China's Feb exports rose 44.5 percent versus year-ago levels -- well above the forecast 13.6 percent gain -- and another strong print may evoke fresh ire from Trump.  Global stocks have been volatile but on the whole, seem to believe all this is just noise. Discerning equity investors with shares in Chinese tech giants Baidu, Tencent or Alibaba also know the Sino-U.S. trade balance vastly overstates China's direct stake in those exports, which include components from Taiwan, Korea and elsewhere in Asia. Which means that U.S. tariffs on Chinese telecoms and electronics are negative for Asia as a whole.  In a worst-case scenario, trade wars may affect Japanese markets more than China if they boost the safe-haven yen and depress the Nikkei.

January's current account deficit was $7.096 billion, worse than forecast, highlighting how dependent Turkey is on foreign capital. Higher interest rates could help fix that by luring overseas flows and reducing inflation, which is in the double digits. But there are fears President Tayyip Erdogan -- a self-declared \"enemy\" of interest rates -- is escalating his campaign for lower borrowing costs.  The lira has already fallen 6 percent to the dollar this year and a bigger current account gap than expected could tip it lower still. The central bank has little firepower to support it. Its next rate-setting meeting on April 25 could become even more crucial after next week.

Sports bankers said the Denver Broncos, New Orleans Saints and Tennessee Titans could change hands in the next few years.  While bidders have emerged for the Panthers, several of them appear unwilling to pay far more than what they believe to be the fair price \u2014 around $2.3 billion, according to people with knowledge of the process.  So far, there are six bidders, according to a person with knowledge of the process, though only four are publicly known. David Tepper, the founder of the hedge fund Appaloosa Management and a minority owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers; Michael Rubin, the chairman of Fanatics, the sports merchandise company; and Ben Navarro, who owns Sherman Financial Group, an investment firm, have each made bids to buy the team. The three offers were between $2 billion and $2.2 billion, according to several people with knowledge of the bids who could not publicly discuss the auction.  Alan Kestenbaum, the chief executive of Bedrock Industries, which owns and operates metal and mining companies, has also bid, though it\u2019s unclear at what price.  The sale of the team has been a point of focus at the N.F.L. owners meeting here. Representatives from the 32 teams were briefed on the auction on Monday. They were told that a winning bid could be selected by the end of April. Assuming the prospective owner survives due diligence, the owners could vote on that bid at their next meeting in Atlanta in late May.

Soon after Sports Illustrated published a report detailing those allegations, Richardson, 82, said he would sell the team.  Certain N.F.L. owners have already started to make their preferences known. Many owners have said that, all bids being equal, they prefer Tepper because he already owns a stake in the Steelers, which he would have to sell if he bought the Panthers, and because he has the financial wherewithal, with a net worth of roughly $11 billion.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Rubin, who teamed up on his bid with Joe Tsai, the co-founder of the Alibaba Group, is also known to N.F.L. owners because Fanatics is the official retail partner of team merchandise.  While both Tepper and Rubin appear willing to continue bidding for the team, neither are prepared to pay $2.5 billion, according to several people with knowledge of the auction, though they could be posturing.  Representatives for Tepper, Rubin, Kestenbaum and Navarro all declined to comment.  At the meetings here, three owners who declined to be identified because they did not want to be seen injecting themselves into the process, said that Navarro\u2019s holdings in companies that lend to subprime borrowers might be a stumbling block for them.  Navarro\u2019s company, Sherman Financial Group, has stakes in financial services companies around the world, but 90 percent of the revenue and income comes from Credit One Bank, which issues credit cards to credit-challenged customers. Credit One has been sued for using aggressive collection techniques.  Among other things, Sherman Financial also buys and manages consumer debt. Sherman Financial also paid a $175,000 penalty to settle a case brought by New York attorney general Eric Scheiderman for unlawful debt collection.

Perhaps the greatest analytical error across the West has been the view that Xi Jinping would want to continue to sustain the liberal, international rules-based order once its economic power began to rival that of the United States. Again, this hope goes against the well-known facts: China has long said that it sees the existing order as one invented by the victors of the last world war, one in which China did not have a seat at the table.  China has never shared the West\u2019s view of human rights. It has long sought to weaken the powers of the United Nations Human Rights Commission. China has at best had an ambivalent attitude to free trade \u2014 just look at its qualified support for the World Trade Organization, its opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership and its own long history of mercantilism.  And as for the global security order, China has never changed its hostility to the global system of American military alliances, in particular those in the Asia Pacific, which it has long attacked as legacies of the Cold War. That\u2019s in addition to China\u2019s assertion of its territorial claims in the South China Sea.  For these reasons, Mr. Xi has explicitly called for \u201ca new type of great power relations,\u201d \u201ca new type of international system\u201d emerging out of the \u201ccurrent struggle for the international order\u201d and a new type of activist Chinese diplomacy that puts to bed Deng Xiaoping\u2019s dictum of \u201chide your strength, bide your time, and never take the lead.\u201d Hence its efforts to foster an alternative multilateral system with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Belt and Road Initiative.  Over time Mr. Xi would like to turn the page on the liberal Western order and write a new chapter in world history. If China in the next decade becomes the largest economy in the world with Mr. Xi still likely its leader, the country\u2019s economic success would be based on a form of state capitalism that rejects the notion that rising income parallels broader economic liberalization and political democracy.

It's not there yet, but it has real potential to one day be the smart home command center Google wants it to be.  It\u2019s hard finding a good roommate. Some leave dishes in the sink. Others stiff you on rent. But Google, or more specifically, the Google Assistant, isn\u2019t like that at all. Everything considered and as far as roommates go, it\u2019s actually one of the best you\u2019ll ever have.  (Update: Google Home can now make calls to landlines in the UK! This was a feature unveiled at last year's Google IO, and has now finally made its way into the home.)  That\u2019s because Google Assistant, the smart artificial intelligence that\u2019s built into the Google Home, actually makes life easier rather than more difficult for you. You can ask it to lower the thermostat for you when you leave, diagnose your symptoms when you\u2019re feeling ill or have it locate that funny clip from Colbert last night and throw it onto your Chromecast without any hesitation.  It\u2019s smart enough to tell you how much plane tickets cost from where you live to any exotic destination you can think of, or prattle off oddly specific information like how much a Macaw weighs (2.6 to 3.3 pounds, apparently) or how much a new piece of technology costs (\u201cAccording to TechRadar, the PlayStation 4 Pro costs $399 or \u00a3349\u201d).  But, ask that very same question using different words or in a slightly different tone, and Google\u2019s ultra-smart assistant suddenly forgets what it just told you.  That general problem \u2013 \u201dit works sometimes but not all the time\u201d \u2013 isn\u2019t just symptomatic of the $129 (\u00a3129/AU$199) Google Home; the Amazon Echo, the current smart home incumbent, is far from immune to them as well. In due time, both devices will get smarter, but as it stands both are more novelty than pragmatic purchases.  Google Home is far from perfect at the moment, but it\u2019s sure to get better over time as Google continues to work on its voice assistant technology, and we\u2019ll be updating our review regularly as new functionality continues to be added.  What's new for Google Home in 2017?  Google might not have shown up with new Home hardware to Google IO 2017, but its latest software update will make the six-month-old Google Home feel like a new machine. To that end, Google announced four major changes coming to the smart speaker in 2017: proactive assistance, hands-free calling, Bluetooth and visual responses. Read on for additional details.  Let\u2019s start off by covering the two biggest announcements first: hands-free calling and Bluetooth. The way calling is going to work when Google rolls out the feature later this year is that you\u2019ll import contacts from your phone and then, when you want to make a phone call, all you\u2019ll need to do is ask.  The Home will make the call from either a private phone number or, if you have your Google account tied to your cell phone, using your own number. From the sounds of it, all you need is an active internet connection to make the calls \u2013 that means you won\u2019t need a landline or even a cell phone to make calls at home.  Another big update, Home will now be able to use Bluetooth to sync up to other devices \u2013 a feature the Home\u2019s competitor, Amazon Echo, has had since it launched and had so far been strangely absent on Google\u2019s smart speaker.  In addition to the Bluetooth announcement, Google announced that the Home will support the free version of Spotify, SoundCloud and Deezer in addition to the music streaming services it already supported later this summer.  The other two announcements \u2013 proactive assistance and visual responses \u2013while neat, aren\u2019t going to radically change how you use Home.  Visual responses, a new feature on Google Home that leverages Google Assistant to send visual information to either your phone, tablet or TV, definitely feels like a swing at the Amazon Echo Show. However, while Amazon\u2019s device comes with a built-in screen to show you events on your calendar or what the weather outside looks like, voice requests on the Home go through Assistant which spits the results onto any Chromecast, Android TV and TVs.  Speaking of the Assistant, Google has recently added a useful new assistance function to its smart assistant that brings it in line with Amazon's Alexa: voice reminders. It's now possible for English speaking Google Home owners in the UK, US, Canada and Australia to set one-off or recurring reminders using their voice, even months in advance of events.  Any reminders you set using your Google Home device will also appear on your Android device as long as it's running software from Android M on. Even if your Google Home has more than one user, you'll only ever hear reminders for you.  Design  Now, because \u201cair freshener\u201d can be a varied description depending on where you are in the world, a more apt description of its shape might be a small vase \u2013 it has a wide bottom and a tapered top. Each Google Home comes with a standard, gray fabric base with a rubber bottom that can be swapped out for a different material or color for around $20 (\u00a318/AU$29).  So far, Google offers two types of bases to match your home decor: metallic and fabric, each with different colors and finishes. Metallic bases are made out of either painted steel or polycarbonate and come in copper, snow or carbon colors. On the fabric side, the three colors are mango, marine and violet, in addition to the standard white mesh listed above.  Pick up a new base for your Google Home on the Google Play Store  From a pure aesthetic point of view, Google Home is the far more attractive option when compared to the Amazon Echo\u2019s all-black canister shape. It\u2019s less ominous than the black monolith and it\u2019s also a fair bit shorter at 5.62 x 3.79 inches (142.8 x 96.4mm; H x D), which means it\u2019s easier for the Home to blend into its surroundings.  There\u2019s also some function to this form, however. The top, flat, inclined surface of the Google Home acts as a touch-capacitive panel, allowing you to change the volume, play and pause the music or activate the Google Home assistant with a tap. Once activated either by pressing the top panel for a couple of seconds or saying the wake word (\u201cOK Google\u201d or \u201cHey Google\u201d), four multi-colored lights twist and whirl to indicate that you\u2019ve caught its attention.  While Amazon\u2019s Echo has a physical control to change its volume, Google Home\u2019s touch controls feel less precise. We do however appreciate the inclusion of a physical button to mute the speaker, which means you can be sure when it is, and is not, listening.  Google Home generally does an ok job of picking up your voice with its two built-in microphones located on the top half of the chassis, but it doesn\u2019t work 100% of the time. Whether this is down to Google\u2019s software, or its reliance on two microphones rather than the Amazon Echo\u2019s five, it means you\u2019ll definitely end up repeating yourself or raising your voice to get its attention more.  Uncap the bottom base and you\u2019ll find a speaker and two passive radiators, which, considering the sheer volume the little device can put out, is impressive. The Amazon Echo has a few more speakers inside its chassis, and can therefore sound a bit better at higher volumes, however what\u2019s under the hood here is enough to get the job done.  Audio performance  While Google Assistant, the voice and smarts inside the speaker, might be the main attraction here, Google Home is actually a pretty capable audio device as well.  It can access all sorts of streaming services \u2013 Google Play Music, YouTube Music, Spotify and Pandora \u2013 and works as a Wi-Fi speaker thanks to its built-in Google Cast capabilities.  What that means in practice is that you\u2019ll be able to ask it to play nearly any song you can think of, and it will either find it on Google Play Music\u2019s 30-million-plus catalogue or, if you\u2019ve taken it up on its free trial offer, pull it up YouTube Music. Think about that for a second. Unlimited access to music on YouTube? Yeah, by far and away, Google Home probably has the largest song library of any audio device on the market.  We tried for an hour to find a song that Google Home couldn\u2019t pull up \u2013 recalling some seriously obscure music, like the theme song from 1998\u2019s Banjo-Kazooie game on N64 to the title track for Requiem for a Dream \u2013 to no avail. Of course, you\u2019ll likely stumble across something that Google Home can\u2019t find, but the fact that we couldn\u2019t stump it after arming ourselves with dozens of songs is absolutely unheard of.  Less impressive is how much difficulty the Google Home had with recognising band names that sound similar to one another. Try as we might, we couldn\u2019t get the speaker to play any music by the band \u2018Brontide\u2019. Sometimes it would claim that their music wasn\u2019t available (it\u2019s on Spotify), or else it would play music or playlists from completely unrelated artists.  It\u2019s also too bad the expansive library of songs is stuck \u2013 for the most part \u2013 inside a less-than-amazing-sounding speaker.  Compared to Bluetooth speakers in its price range like, say, the Creative Sound Blaster Roar 2 or Razer Leviathan Mini, music on the Google Home comes off as less robust with little separation and little punch in the low-end or clarity in the mids and highs.  Now, it\u2019s not completely incapable for playing decent-sounding music \u2013 it does have some bass and some mids \u2013 but, if you\u2019re expecting Google Home to replace your Hi-Fi setup, you\u2019ll be severely disappointed. (Audiophiles, keep in mind that a vast majority of the time Google Home sources its music from YouTube, a site infamous for its audio compression.)  But Google Home makes up for its less-than-pristine audio quality with a feature that other speakers don\u2019t have, and that\u2019s its ability to both receive and send Google Cast signals, making it the only audio device that can not only stream music from your phone, but send video streams to any Google Cast-compatible connected devices as well.  Google Cast and Chromecast performance  One of our smaller frustrations with the Amazon Echo Dot, Amazon\u2019s smart speaker that\u2019s designed to be plugged into an existing audio setup, was that there was no way to control which speaker was used as its output using voice commands.  In theory, Google Home doesn\u2019t have this issue. Simply set up a Chromecast with a name that\u2019s easy to pronounce, and you can tell your Google Home to cast your favourite songs or even videos to your Hi-Fi and TV respectively.  At launch in both the UK and Australia, it supported a number of local streaming services. For example, in the UK we were able to play BBC Radio 4 on the speaker directly, which it was intelligent enough to automatically stream from iPlayer, and it was also capable of streaming from Channel 4\u2019s All 4 streaming app.  In theory it\u2019s a great streaming solution, but in practice we had trouble with the functionality.  Take as an example the phrase, \u201cWatch Rick and Morty from Netflix on Jon\u2019s Projector.\u201d If your pronunciation is perfect then the command will work most of the time, but if the speaker fails to hear any part of the instruction then it will fail completely.  Then there\u2019s the issue of selecting specific episodes, which Google Home is unable to do. Ask it to play a show and it will start from where you last left off, but you can\u2019t ask it to play a specific episode. Skipping between episodes, meanwhile, works well.  We\u2019d love it if the speaker was intelligent enough to remember part of the command and ask for clarification on the parts that it didn\u2019t understand, but as it stands you have to get the whole command right in one go.  It\u2019s also a pain to control playback once you\u2019ve started casting. Instructing the speaker to \u2018play\u2019 or \u2018pause\u2019 works well, but if you tell it to play another song then it suddenly forgets that it\u2019s casting and will instead play the new song from the Home\u2019s own speaker.  The big promise with Google Assistant was that it would be contextually aware, but from our experience it has a long way to go. You\u2019ll find yourself repeating a lot of information that the Home should be able to work out itself.  Google Home as the center of your smart home  Of course, Chromecast isn\u2019t the only device that Google Home can talk to. There are a half-dozen devices that can hook into Google Home right now, or will be able to do so soon. (We\u2019ve compiled a list of the best Google Home smart home devices so you don\u2019t have to waste time tracking each one down.)  The highlights of what Google Home can connect to right now are Nest thermostats, Philips Hue lightbulbs and Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform, while support for even more third-party devices like LIFX lightbulbs and LG MusicFlow speakers should be coming soon.  Google Home will also integrate with thermostats from Netatmo and Tado.  Although you\u2019ll frequently need to sign into these third-party products, once you\u2019re in the functionality works well. We tested the Google Home with a Nest setup and found that its commands were easy and intuitive to give.  Recently, Google announced that Home would support several new smart home ecosystems including products from August, Wink, LIFX, TP-Link, Rachio, Vivent, First Alert, Frigidaire, Logitech, Geeni, Anova and US-retailer Best Buy\u2019s Insignia brand. Together, these should give you far more options for which devices you can string together and give you more control of your burgeoning smart home.  While further hardware integration is nice, one of the largest problem Google Home faces is that it can\u2019t integrate with many of Google\u2019s own services \u2013 like Gmail, Voice and Docs \u2013 which have been its bread and butter for years.  Take Gmail, for instance. You\u2019d think Google Home might be able to rattle off the subjects of your top 10 emails \u2013 but, surprise, it can\u2019t. The same goes for Google Calendar where it\u2019s unable to create new events (although it will happily read out existing events in your calendar), make phone calls with Google Voice or jot down some quick notes in a Google Doc. Google has a dozen services that the Home should be able to link into and yet, in its current state, simply cannot. Not only is this a big disappointment, but it makes us wonder why this functionality wasn't given more of a priority.  And while it\u2019s easy to hammer this point home and point out all Google Home\u2019s shortcomings in one long-winded tirade, we\u2019re not going to. That\u2019s not because we\u2019re avoiding the harsh criticism or defending the Home, we\u2019re not.  But we\u2019ve already fallen into that trap of being overly critical of a smart platform once before with Amazon Echo, and since then it has flourished into an amazingly smart, connected platform that can answer hundreds more questions than it could two short years ago. It can order pizza or restock the refrigerator or call an Uber or check what time a restaurant closes, and the list of everything it can do grows week over week.  Google Home can do some of that already, making it far and away a better system now than the Echo was when it first launched. Some of that it can\u2019t. But, speaking from experience, it\u2019s only going to get better, smarter and more robust in the coming weeks, months and years.  It\u2019s just not there yet.  We liked  One thing\u2019s for sure: You might never appreciate just how much music is on YouTube without buying a Google Home. While some of the biggest music streaming services in the world boast libraries of 25, 30 and even 40 million songs, they\u2019re far from complete. We\u2019re not saying Google Home is capable of playing any song you can think of, but after dredging the depths of the \u201990s we still couldn\u2019t find a tune Google Home couldn\u2019t find.  And while Google Home excels as a DJ, it\u2019s also a surprisingly intelligent smart home hub. It already hooks into some of the largest platforms now by including Nest, Philips and Samsung\u2019s SmartThings, and given a few months that number will grow even more.  Its Google Cast functionality is excellent, and has real potential.  We disliked  Clearly the lack of integration into Google\u2019s own services is a huge issue. The fact that it can\u2019t shoot an email to someone in your contacts or help you schedule events through Google Calendar are massive oversights that vastly reduce how useful the Home could be.  The other problem with Google Assistant is how precise you have to be when asking your questions. Asking what year a song was written might not turn up any results, while asking what year a song was released might unveil the exact answer you were looking for. Follow up any inquiry with a simple request like \u201cOK Google, tell me more about it\u201d and it suddenly forgets what you\u2019ve been talking about for the past 30 seconds.  A lack of contextual awareness is also a massive problem for its Google Cast functionality right now. Be prepared to reiterate where you want your music to play from a lot when using Google Home.  Admittedly, this lack of contextual awareness isn\u2019t something that Alexa deals with \u2013 which is surprising considering that the Echo doesn\u2019t come from the company with 20-plus years of search engine experience.  Final verdict  It\u2019s easy to feel disappointed with Google Home when you buy one and expect it to be the coveted center of the smart home Google has marketed it as. It\u2019s just not there yet. It\u2019s a bit too rigid in its language comprehension, its list of smart home devices is growing but still a bit underwhelming, and, perhaps the biggest disappointment of all, it doesn\u2019t have many of Google\u2019s core services built into it.  The best comparison for Google Home, obviously, is the Amazon Echo. They both have identical functions, fetch music from similar sources and are stumped, largely, by the same set of questions. While the Echo is still the more formidable of the two thanks to the dozens of developers who have created bespoke commands, the Home is \u2013 at worst \u2013 about six months behind in development.  There\u2019s also the issue that although the Home is more ambitious with its media playback, it hasn\u2019t worked out a way for you to access this functionality in a way that\u2019s simple enough to be done with your voice. There\u2019s little point in having all that functionality when it\u2019s a chore to use.  Given the same attention from hardware and software developers and some of those additional Google services, the Home could quickly grow from a nascent smart speaker with Chromecast integration to the first and most critical piece of the ever-expanding smart home.  For now, the Google Home is simply a smart novelty with access to YouTube Music, built-in Google Cast and the ability to save you a trip to the light switch.", "stock": "BABA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-01-16", "source": "techradar", "url": "http://www.techradar.com/news/google-maps-has-gingerly-returned-to-china-after-an-eight-year-absence"}, {"article": "When Nokia first launched the 2017 edition of the 3310, I wrote a story explaining why it should be a 4G smartphone. At the time, Reliance Jio was preparing to launch the JioPhone in India, something many thought would be a \u201crevolution\u201d.  However, the Nokia 3310 turned out to be a phone that tried to monetise nostalgia. It was a 2G phone in a 4G world, and reviewers like me were quick to dismiss it.  Admittedly, we don\u2019t have statistics on how much this phone actually sold. Yet, it\u2019s fair to say that the Nokia 3310 (2017) was a failed product, at least from a critics point of view. In this case, mine. But HMD Global is now said to be working on a 4G version of the product, apparently tying up with Reliance Jio for the same. Have they finally come to their senses?  But, do we need it now?  A year hence, the JioPhone is among us, as are a plethora of other 4G feature phones or low-cost 4G smartphones. As with Nokia\u2019s entire smartphone line, the Nokia 3310 is also late to the party.  Admittedly, the JioPhone has been out of stock for the better part of its life cycle, while there\u2019s no word on how many Micromax Bharat phones have been sold. But we do have many options already in the 4G feature phones and low-cost  In 2017, a 4G Nokia 3310 would have been the perfect mix of nostalgia and usefulness. It would have been the damage-proof feature phone with modern aesthetics and connectivity. It can still be that, but no one\u2019s really asking that question anymore. Instead, the questions HMD Global will be faced with are,  Does this have WhatsApp?  Can I browse Facebook?  And so on\u2026.  And the answers to all those questions will be no. The Nokia 3310 (2017) doesn\u2019t support WhatsApp, and there\u2019s no reason to think this new one will either. But herein lies a twist.  Will the Nokia 3310 support WhatsApp?  YunOS  Last year\u2019s phone ran Nokia\u2019s Series 30+ OS, a seriously hamstrung software for 2017. But this new one runs on YunOS, a fork of Android made by Chinese giant Alibaba. I\u2019ve had the good fortune to interact with YunOS in my many trips to China, and I have to admit it\u2019s impressive software. YunOS is on televisions, phones, and even home cleaning robots. While Series 30+ lacks app support of any real sign of modernism, YunOS is at the forefront of today\u2019s software, at least from a feature phone point of view.  But then, YunOS has never been seen outside China either. Would this be the phone that finally gets Alibaba\u2019s software across borders? Unlikely, but it could mean HMD Global will run a forked version of Android (much like Micromax\u2019s Bharat 1) here in India. And it would make all the sense, if the company wants to take advantage of 4G connectivity. If not, it\u2019s just a handy Internet dongle that costs you three-odd thousand bucks.  With Android at its core, the Nokia 3310 could actually be a \u201cpremium\u201d 4G feature phone, something this market truly lacks. A huge chunk of the Indian market still uses feature phones, and for that market, the Nokia 3310 could suddenly become a sign of affluence. \u201cFeature phones remain the dominant category in the total mobile phone market, with annual shipments of 136.1 million units. The category declined by only 9.4 percent in CY2016 as compared to 16.2 percent in CY2015,\u201d said a report by the International Data Corporation, in February last year.  4G connectivity is not enough  Essentially, if Nokia, or HMD Global, is to sell a 4G Nokia 3310 in India, it has to be running Android. If not, it\u2019s really the feature phone equivalent of the OnePlus 5 and 5T. It\u2019s an upgrade for the sake of an upgrade. At the very least, HMD Global will have to add support for apps like WhatsApp and vastly improve the apps it does have. Given that Series 30+ isn\u2019t capable of much more, it\u2019s unlikely that that will happen. For a company that sells smartphones on the \u201cPure, secure and always up to date\u201d, it shouldn\u2019t take much to realise the importance of Android here.", "stock": "BABA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-01-30", "source": "techradar", "url": "http://www.techradar.com/news/the-nokia-3310-4g-needs-to-be-on-android-in-india"}, {"article": "The Magic Leap One release date has finally be revealed, at least if you're willing to test out the \"Creator Edition\" of these augmented reality (AR) glasses.  It's the future of wearables, smartphones and computing, according to the Florida-based Magic Leap, and it's all distilled into funky-looking AR glasses strapped to your face.  What's it like? Well, take the virtual objects you see in a VR headset and break down the wall so that you can see what's in front of you. That's the concept behind AR or \"mixed reality.\"  [Update: Magic Leap has opened its doors to content creators, letting them begin to build apps and games for the Magic Leap One platform. The secretive startup has launched a Creators Portal and SDK to give developers access to tools and resources they'll need to make content for the AR glasses. It's still early days, but it's a good sign that Magic Leap is progressing nicely... and that it will have content to play with at launch.]  There's more to the Magic Leap One prototype than meets the eye. It consists of Lightwear glasses, a Lightpack computing platform and a remote. This is way more involved than Google Glass for 2018.  There's still a lot of mystery to Magic Leap. Let's explore your AR future.  Magic Leap One will launch in 2018, according to the company, though it failed to go into any more specifics than that in a Rolling Stone reveal.  It's been a long time coming considering the fact that Magic Leap has been in development for five years now, with nothing but conceptual ideas to show.  Clearly investors believe in the timeline behind Magic Leap. It's attracted hundreds of millions of dollars from companies like Google and Alibaba.  We'll continue to track the Magic Leap release date as we all get closer to donning the first developer AR glasses in public.  What is available now is a Technical Preview of the Creators Portal and SDK for developers. This provides tools and resources on which to create content for Magic Leap One, which is a good sign the mixed reality glasses are inching closer to a release date.  Magic Leap One price  If you were holding out for a low price, you might want to sit down. The Magic Leap price will be similar to a \"higher-end mobile phone to higher-end tablet\" for the cheapest version.  This is according to Magic Leap CEO Rony Abovitz, who revealed this information in an interview with Recode in February. Abovitz didn't object to the Magic Leap price being compared to the iPhone X, which costs 1,000 or \u00a31,000 to start.  Image 1 of 3 Image 2 of 3 Image 3 of 3  And that's just for the Magic Leap starting price. The CEO said the Creator Edition will be priced somewhere in the range of the Microsoft HoloLens, which is $3,000 or \u00a32,719.  The justification for this high price? Magic Leap One is meant to replace many devices, not just, say, a smartphone, thus saving you thousands in the long-run. By comparison, the Google Glass price was $1,500 (\u00a31,000, about AU$1,956), and it promised less.  The future is often exciting, and also more times than not very expensive. Also, Magic Leap doesn't have many competitors in the AR glasses space, so it's free to set its own price. The question is: will developers and consumers be buying?  How to buy Magic Leap One  When Magic Leap One: Creator Edition does go on sale, there's a good chance you'll fit into one of the categories they're targeting.  So far, creators include developers, brands, agencies and even early adopter consumers, according to Rolling Stone, comparing the glass's potential audience to the sort of people who bought the first iPod.  In other words, this developer kit won't be limited to the developer community. It's going after consumer content creators, too.  Lightwear goggles  Magic Leap One is more than just a pair of AR glasses with a camera on it (see: Snapchat Spectacles and its less-than-a-year popularity span).  \u201cIt\u2019s what we think of as spatial computing. It has full awareness,\u201d according to founder Rony Abovitz in the Rolling Stone piece. Think Microsoft Hololens, but with a slightly larger field of view.  How does Magic Leap One work? It uses lightfield photonics to generate digital light at different depths and blend seamlessly with natural light to produce lifelike digital objects that coexist in the real world.  In other words, it's supposed to fool your brain into thinking the virtual objects set against real-world environments all look natural. That's going to make it more comfortable to wear the Lightwear goggles for a longer period of time.  Magic Leap is particularly working on expanding the field of view in its glasses and determined to make it comfortable to wear. Even if the bulky AR glasses look a bit awkward, they should feel good wearing for a few hours.  Lightpack computing platform  Not all of Magic Leap One is contained in the Lightwear goggles. The computing power is relegated to a Lightpack that fits in a pocket or, if you really want to look uncool, it can be clipped to a belt.  But you can't get away with using Magic Leap One without this spatial computing platform. While the company isn't talking about CPU and GPU chips, this disk-shaped \"computer\" is where the high-powered processing takes place.  It does have a cable, but at least you're not tied to a computer or a backpack VR kit, like we've seen from other high-end virtual reality headsets.  Controller  Interacting with the new, virtually overlain world around you is done through rather traditional means: a familiar-looking motion controller.  Control \u2013 what Magic Leap is calling its controller \u2013 is a remote that contains buttons, six-degrees of freedom motion sensing and a touchpad. There's also haptic feedback, according to the official Magic Leap website.  The remote-shaped controller appears to be very similar to what we've experienced on Samsung Gear VR and Google Daydream headset controllers.  The AR future is now  Magic Leap content ranges from games to music experiences to Oculus Connect-like digital collaborations so far, and these are being billed as \"just a jumping-off point\" for creators.  The company wants you to be able to pull the web out of the screen, with 3D virtual objects and be able to open up multiple screens on demand.  That long-sought-after goal of a Minority Report future may be within our grasp in 2018. Whether or not Magic Leap One can deliver that remains to be seen. But we're at least a whole lot closer to that exciting (augmented) reality.", "stock": "BABA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-19", "source": "techradar", "url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/magic-leap-one"}, {"article": "Experimental feature Listen to this article Play audio for this article Pause 00:00 00:00 Experimental feature Report a mispronounced word What was mispronounced?

Ultimately, the idea is to help AI systems process large amounts of written data to more accurately respond to human questions. \"That means objective questions such as 'what causes rain' can now be answered with high accuracy by machines,\" Alibaba chief scientist Luo Si said in a statement. \"The technology underneath can be gradually applied to numerous applications such as customer service, museum tutorials and online responses to medical inquiries from patients, decreasing the need for human input in an unprecedented way.\"", "stock": "BABA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-01-16", "source": "engadget", "url": "https://www.engadget.com/2018/01/15/alibaba-microsoft-ai-beat-humans-stanford-reading-test/"}, {"article": "In its annual report on the trade of illicit goods in online and physical marketplaces, the USTR said Taobao hasn't \"objectively demonstrated that the volume or prevalence of counterfeit goods has decreased over the last year.\"  Alibaba cited its brand protection programs and offline cooperation with law enforcement as evidence that it addressed the concerns raised by the USTR. \"The number of takedown requests declined by 25% YoY as a direct result of our ability to remove infringing listings before they make it to our marketplaces,\" said Alibaba group president Michael Evans in his response.

Not surprisingly, the region has a tenuous relationship with Beijing, which is more than 1,400 miles away. Protests, riots and even terrorist attacks have been connected to the Uyghur struggle, which gives cover to Chinese authorities to implement the harshest strategies there.  \"Abuses are most apparent in Xinjiang because of the lack of privacy protections but also because the power imbalance between the people there and the police is the greatest in China,\" said Maya Wang, China researcher at Human Rights Watch.  \"The power imbalance between the people there and the police is the greatest in China.\"  That is why security investment in Xinjiang skyrocketed after the riots. According to Adrian Zenz, a lecturer at the European School of Culture and Theology who has written extensively about the police presence in Xinjiang and Tibet, the region's security forces doubled between 2009 and 2011 to more than 11,000 people. And it kept growing: In 2017, he documented more than 65,000 public job advertisements for security-related positions in Xinjiang, and last year Amnesty International estimated that there were 90,000 security staff in the region, the highest ratio of people to security in any province in China.  Several new tools and tactics accompanied this rise in security personnel, most notably the implementation of \"convenience police stations,\" a dense network of street corner, village or neighborhood police stations designed to keep an eye out everywhere and rapidly respond to any threat, perceived or real. But there were also corresponding investments in security technology on a globally unprecedented scale. It started with a drive to put up security cameras in the aftermath of the 2009 riots before evolving into something far more sophisticated, as Xinjiang turned into a place for state-connected companies to test all of their surveillance innovations.  \"The rule of law doesn't exist,\" said William Nee, China researcher at Amnesty International. \"They are able to pioneer new methods of control that, if successful, they could use elsewhere in China.\"  Today, Xinjiang has both a massive security presence and ubiquitous surveillance technology: facial-recognition cameras; iris and body scanners at checkpoints, gas stations and government facilities; the collection of DNA samples for a massive database; mandatory apps that monitor messages and data flow on Uyghurs' smartphones; drones to monitor the borders. While there's some debate over how advanced the system tying these technologies together is, it's clear that China's plan is for a fully integrated system that uses artificial intelligence to rapidly process massive amounts of information for use by the similarly massive numbers of police in convenience stations.  \"[Xinjiang] represents a very new frontier and approach when it comes to online surveillance and oppression.\"  For Uyghurs, it means that wherever they go, whomever they talk to and even whatever they read online are all being monitored by the Chinese government. According to The New York Times, \"When Uighurs buy a kitchen knife, their ID data is etched on the blade as a QR code.\" BuzzFeed documented stories of family members too scared to speak openly to relatives abroad. And the combination of all of these tools through increasingly powerful AI and data processing means absolute control and little freedom.  \"It's one thing to have GPS tracking. It's another thing to monitor social media usage of large populations,\" said Feldstein. \"But to do that in combination with a large DNA database of up to 40 million people and to integrate those methods with other modes of surveillance and intrusion -- that represents a very new frontier and approach when it comes to online surveillance and oppression.\"  The result, at least for China, is a massive success. Violence in the region has fallen as riots, protests and attacks are now rare in Xinjiang. Part of that is due to the presence of the state, but it's also related to a rise in fear, as no one is sure how pervasive the Chinese surveillance apparatus is.  \"People can never be sure if they are free from monitoring,\" said Nicole Morgret, project coordinator at the Uyghur Human Rights Project. \"The fear is such that even if the surveillance is not complete, people behave as if it is. The technology is being rolled out so quickly.\"  That is because access to the actual platforms being used by the Chinese authorities is limited, and much of the knowledge about surveillance technology comes from observations by the few journalists who can report from Xinjiang or through looking at public tender and budget documents. Or, increasingly, the knowledge comes from observing how other regions in China are being monitored and how Chinese tech companies abroad are deploying or marketing similar tools.", "stock": "BABA", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-22", "source": "engadget", "url": "https://www.engadget.com/2018/02/22/china-xinjiang-surveillance-tech-spread/"}, {"article": "A sign for Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. at the fourth World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, Zhejiang province, China, Dec. 3, 2017.  A sign for Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. at the fourth World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, Zhejiang province, China, Dec. 3, 2017. Photo: aly song/Reuters  SHANGHAI\u2014Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. said it will acquire a 33% stake in its financial services affiliate Ant Financial Services Group, in a move that could signal that Ant is being readied for a public offering.  The Ant equity purchase was announced as Alibaba reported robust third-quarter earnings of 24.1 billion yuan ($3.82 billion), up from 17.9 billion yuan in the like quarter the previous year. That topped a forecast of 21.6 billion yuan by analysts polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence.  Revenue for the quarter increased 56% from the year-earlier period, to 83.0 billion yuan.  Ant, which was carved out in 2011 during the run-up to Alibaba\u2019s own IPO, runs the fast-growing Alipay mobile payment platform used by Chinese consumers to purchase goods and services, including items on Alibaba\u2019s online shopping sites.  Alibaba said it will acquire the Ant stake as part of a deal approved in 2014. In return, the ecommerce company would transfer intellectual property to Ant, with no cash impact to Alibaba.  The acquisition of the one-third stake in Ant would put Alibaba in a position to benefit if Ant were to go public, which has long been anticipated. Ant Financial was last valued at $60 billion in a 2016 financing round, and the company has grown significantly since then.  Scott Freeze, chief investment officer at Sabretooth Advisors in Pennsylvania, whose fund owns Alibaba stock, said the move suggests Alibaba is preparing its Ant affiliate for a public offering and wants to profit from the company\u2019s mobile payments business as it expands in India, Japan and Korea and other countries.  Alibaba shares were down about 3.8% in recent trade in New York. Mr. Freeze said the sell off was an overreaction to the news, as the stake would give Alibaba access to direct revenue from Ant and more authority over decision-making.  Alibaba\u2019s Chief Financial Officer Maggie Wu declined to comment on IPO speculation.  The companies said that following Alibaba\u2019s stake acquisition, they would terminate their current profit-sharing arrangement which entitles Alibaba to 37.5% of Ant\u2019s pre-tax profit, paid in the form of royalty and technology fees. There would be no cash impact to Alibaba.  Ant paid Alibaba $30 million in such fees in the three months to December, down sharply from amounts in recent quarters because Ant spent heavily to grow its Alipay user base.  Ant paid Alibaba a total of $735 million during the 2017 calendar year, implying that Ant\u2019s pre-tax profit last year was roughly $2 billion.  In a call with investors, Alibaba Vice Chairman Joe Tsai said the Ant stake would allow Alibaba to expand its role of providing value-added services such as mobile payments to upgrade traditional brick and mortar businesses.  The agreement would also give Alibaba more firepower to expand overseas, as payment methods are a key component of online retail, he said.  In its third-quarter report, Alibaba said revenue from its core ecommerce unit\u2014which runs China\u2019s two most popular online retail sites, Taobao and Tmall\u2014remained strong. Sales rose 57% to 73.2 billion yuan.  Alibaba is seeking to expand beyond online commerce into physical retail stores as well, expanding its chain of supermarkets and making a $2.9 billion investment in China\u2019s second-largest big-box retailer Sun Art Retail in the quarter.  Alibaba said its cloud-computing business revenue more than doubled to 3.6 billion yuan, as it attracted more paying customers and introduced more paying services.  Sales from Alibaba\u2019s digital-media and entertainment division, which includes mobile browser UCWeb, video-streaming site Youku Tudou and Alibaba Pictures Group , rose to 5.4 billion yuan. Analysts say intense competition in the digital-entertainment space will weigh on the company going forward, as Alibaba seeks to invest in more content to attract new viewers.  Alibaba\u2019s Youku video-streaming platform attracted about 374 million monthly active users as of Dec 2017, behind Baidu-backed iQiyi and Tencent Video, according to Quest Mobile figures.  \u2014Chuin-Wei Yap contributed to this story  Write to Liza Lin at Liza.Lin@wsj.com", "stock": "BABA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-01", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/alibaba-earnings-jump-35-1517488507"}, {"article": "Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, which with an affiliate currently owns 43% of food-delivery service Ele.me\u2014whose drivers here prepare for a morning shift in Beijing last September\u2014said Monday that it will buy the rest.

Wanda is now in business with China\u2019s two largest internet giants as it moves to shore up its balance sheet. The company struck an agreement in late January to sell a 34-billion-yuan stake in its property business, which mainly comprises shopping malls, to a group that included Chinese social-media titan Tencent Holdings Ltd.  Last year, Wanda came under fire from Beijing for its aggressive overseas deal-making, which curtailed the company\u2019s ability to pay for overseas acquisitions and repay debt.

In a regulatory filing Monday, Mr. Wang\u2019s publicly listed cinema unit, Wanda Film Holding Co., said it would sell a stake of more than 12% to Alibaba and Cultural Investment Holdings Co. , a film company partly owned by the Beijing municipal government.  Alibaba will buy a 7.7% stake in Wanda Film for about 4.7 billion yuan, while Cultural Investment will take a stake of about 5% for 3.1 billion yuan, Wanda Film said.  Wanda Film said the deal with Alibaba was signed to strengthen their partnership in movie distribution, film investment, advertising and online ticket sales.

Alibaba founder Jack Ma, center, raises a ceremonial mallet before striking a bell during the company's IPO at the New York Stock Exchange. Photo: Mark Lennihan/Associated Press  Technology giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is working on a plan to list on a stock exchange in its home market, China, according to people familiar with the matter, more than three years after its blockbuster initial public offering in New York.  Alibaba is evaluating ways in which its shares could be traded by investors on the mainland, the people said. A secondary listing in China could happen as soon as this summer if the country\u2019s securities rules are changed to allow listings of foreign companies, one of the people added. While the bulk of Alibaba\u2019s business and operations are in China, the nearly 20-year-old company is incorporated in the Cayman Islands.  Chinese laws have long prohibited overseas companies from selling shares directly to local investors. China also currently forbids companies with shares that carry different voting rights to list on the mainland. Alibaba has a complex ownership structure that gives its founders and a small group of executives more control over the company than other shareholders.  The company in 2014 launched a $25 billion float on the New York Stock Exchange in what remains the world\u2019s largest IPO.  An Alibaba spokeswoman said the company has been considering a listing in China since 2014, if regulations would permit it.  Chinese authorities are trying to lure some of the country\u2019s technology stalwarts back to its capital markets. Alibaba\u2019s shares have climbed 86% over the past year and have more than doubled since their IPO, gains that investors in China have largely missed out on. The company now has a market capitalization of around $493 billion and is one of the world\u2019s most valuable technology firms.  In recent months, China\u2019s securities regulator has been in touch with several investment banks to discuss ways to allow companies listed abroad to issue securities on the mainland, the Journal previously reported.  Liu Shiyu, chairman of the Chinese securities regulator, recently confirmed the government has been working to win over overseas Chinese listings. \u201cYou will see results,\u201d he said on the sidelines of a legislative meeting in Beijing last week. \u201cA bit slower than the firms expect and a bit quicker than you expect,\u201d he added.  Noting that Chinese investors haven\u2019t been able to profit from the share gains of some foreign-listed companies that he didn\u2019t identify, Mr. Liu called it \u201ca pity, a real pity\u201d and said this \u201ccannot happen again.\u201d China\u2019s securities regulator didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment Thursday.  Some of the regulator\u2019s discussions with banks have revolved around the creation of financial instruments called depositary receipts, which represent interests in the shares of foreign-listed companies.  Enticing Chinese tech companies trading abroad, such as Alibaba, Baidu Inc. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. , to list at home has become a national priority in recent months.  Chinese regulators want large homegrown companies and promising startups to participate in its capital markets, giving retail investors an opportunity to tap into the wealth generated by successful companies, among other goals. Tencent, whose shares have also doubled over the past year, is listed in Hong Kong, while Baidu is listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market.  A dual listing on the mainland would give Chinese companies the option of raising money domestically in their local currency and help boost their profile at home, said Rocky Lee, managing partner of the Silicon Valley office of law firm King & Wood Mallesons. He added that well-known companies could potentially fetch higher valuations for their shares from local investors, because their brands and businesses are better known domestically.  However, China\u2019s stock market has historically had a reputation for being akin to a casino, and some analysts have said the listings of a few hot names could fuel speculation by Chinese individual investors, who dominate trading in the markets.  From the Archives Alibaba is China\u2019s largest e-commerce company but it does a lot more than just sell toys and clothes. The WSJ\u2019s Ken Brown explains how Alibaba\u2019s network of interconnected products and services have led them to become the biggest e-commerce company in China. (Originally Published May 4, 2014)  China\u2019s securities regulator is expected to announce plans for a depositary share regime in the coming months, said people familiar with discussions it has had recently.  Depositary receipts are a common feature of major stock markets in the U.S. and Europe. Dozens of Chinese companies that are listed on the NYSE or Nasdaq have American depositary receipt programs typically administered by large banks.  In the case of Baidu, every 10 American depositary shares represent an interest in one of the internet company\u2019s class A ordinary shares. Alibaba\u2019s New York-listed securities are also American depositary shares, with each representing one ordinary share.  Another tech company that is considering listing in China as well as overseas is smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp., people familiar with the matter previously told the Journal. The homegrown company is planning to raise at least $10 billion in an initial public offering later this year, and has picked Hong Kong as its main listing venue but is also considering a concurrent listing on the mainland at the behest of Chinese authorities, the people said. Xiaomi\u2019s parent company is also incorporated in the Cayman Islands, and to list in China it may also have to use a depositary receipt structure.  \u2014Chao Deng contributed to this article  Write to Julie Steinberg at julie.steinberg@wsj.com and Liza Lin at Liza.Lin@wsj.com", "stock": "BABA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-15", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-tech-titan-alibaba-plans-stock-market-homecoming-1521116131"}, {"article": "Lucy Peng will focus on running Lazada Group, an operator of online retail marketplaces in Southeast Asia that Alibaba invested $2 billion in.

Photo: Misha Friedman/Bloomberg News  Lucy Peng, one of China\u2019s richest businesswomen, is leaving the helm of one of the country\u2019s most valuable private companies.  Ms. Peng, 44 years old, stepped down as executive chairman of Ant Financial Services Group, the giant financial-technology affiliate of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA -2.21% that she led for eight years.  She is being replaced by Eric Jing, Ant\u2019s chief executive officer, who is taking on the additional chairman role with immediate effect, Ant said in a statement Monday. Mr. Jing, who is 45 years old, has been CEO since October 2016, when he took over the job from Ms. Peng.  Ant said Ms. Peng will focus on running Lazada Group, an operator of online retail marketplaces in Southeast Asia that Alibaba is using as a beachhead to expand in the region. Ant\u2019s statement said Lazada\u2019s growth is a key part of Alibaba\u2019s global strategy.  Ms. Peng, who is also one of Alibaba\u2019s co-founders, was named CEO of the Singapore-based company in March after Alibaba invested $2 billion in Lazada, adding to an earlier multibillion-dollar investment. She is also chairman of the company, in which Alibaba took a controlling stake in 2016.  Ant\u2019s management change comes as the company is raising as much as $5 billion from private investors, according to people familiar with the matter. The effort is widely seen as a prelude to an initial public offering of Ant, though there is no certainty the company will proceed with a listing in the near term. A spokesman for Ant declined to comment.  Hangzhou-based Ant\u2019s last announced fundraising round was in April 2016, when the company secured $4.5 billion from Chinese investors and earned a valuation of around $60 billion. Since then, the company has increased revenue, expanded its giant Alipay mobile-payments network, entered new markets and widened its scope of financial services for individuals and small businesses. It also has an asset-management business that oversees the world\u2019s largest money-market fund.  Ant\u2019s current fundraising effort includes local and foreign investors, who have subscribed to at least $3 billion of its shares, a person familiar with the matter said. Some market participants expect the latest share sale to give Ant a valuation of close to $100 billion.  Ms. Peng, who is famously media shy, has been a confidante of billionaire founder Jack Ma. She ran Alipay from 2010 to 2014, a period that spanned the business getting carved out from Alibaba and its rebranding as Ant. She went on to lead Ant as its CEO until 2016. Ms. Peng also became a billionaire after Alibaba\u2019s 2014 initial public offering.  \u201cShe definitely doesn\u2019t seek the limelight, but she gets on with it,\u201d said Duncan Clark, a former investment banker and chairman of tech consultancy BDA China, who wrote a book on Alibaba. Mr. Clark recalled that when some Ant staff pushed for transport and other perks similar to those provided by Western tech giants such as Apple or Google, Ms. Peng rebuffed them, telling her staff to focus on working hard. \u201cShe was very matter of fact,\u201d he added.  Before working at Ant, Ms. Peng held a longtime role as Alibaba\u2019s chief human-resources executive. She played an integral role in establishing Ant\u2019s corporate culture and overseeing the expansion of Alipay, which is used by more than 520 million people to pay for everything including groceries, movie tickets and utility bills.  Mr. Ma, in an internal email Monday, said that when Ms. Peng took the post of executive chairman of Lazada, \u201cLucy told me the time had come for Eric to take on even more responsibility and for her to step away and give Ant\u2019s leadership team the space to grow even faster.\u201d  Mr. Jing previously held other positions within Ant and Alipay, including chief operating officer, president and chief financial officer. He joined Alibaba in 2007 as a finance executive and started working at Alipay two years later.  Mr. Jing on Monday called Ms. Peng a mentor and said she was \u201cinstrumental in cultivating a world-class Ant Financial team\u201d that will stay true to its mission, according to Ant\u2019s statement.  Alibaba said in February that it would acquire about a one-third stake in Ant and end a profit-sharing agreement with the affiliate.

The $522-billion Chinese firm said Thursday that its revenue last quarter grew 56% from a year ago to $12.8 billion\u2014the highest ever. The December quarter always has been big for Alibaba because of Singles\u2019 Day, an annual shopping bonanza in China on Nov. 11.  But part of the increase came from acquisitions as well as its big push into physical retail. This is the first quarter that Alibaba included revenue from Cainiao, its logistics subsidiary, after it increased its stake to 51% in October. It took private department store operator Intime last May. Alibaba also has opened 26 supermarkets, named Hema, in seven cities.  Stripping all those out, revenue would have grown only 41%\u2014still impressive but slower than usual over the past two years. Taking its toll last quarter: China\u2019s crackdown on internet finance and the expulsion of migrant workers in Beijing. Alibaba\u2019s aggressive expansion in physical retail also weighed on margins. Operating profit margin for its e-commerce segment shrank to 48% from 59% from a year earlier.  Alibaba also said it would acquire a 33% stake in Ant Financial, its affiliate that operates China\u2019s largest mobile payment system Alipay. This was expected, according to a 2014 agreement. It will, however, hurt Alibaba as it is receiving 37.5% of Ant\u2019s pretax profits as royalty and technology services fees. But such profit share fell last quarter because of Ant\u2019s aggressive spending to acquire new users. Faced with strong competition from Tencent, profit at Ant may continue to be under pressure.  While Alibaba is still growing fast, much of that has been priced in\u2014the stock trades at 42 times this year\u2019s expected GAAP earnings, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence, after doubling in the past year.

Other big IPOs have seen narrower day-one ranges. The trading range of Snap on its first day was 10.85%, while for Chinese technology giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. it was 10.84%. Snap\u2019s IPO took place last year, while Alibaba\u2019s was in 2014.  Spotify had \u201cfairly low volatility for the first day of trading for a technology IPO,\u201d said Cameron Stanfill, an analyst at PitchBook.  Spotify used an unusual maneuver called a direct listing to go public. The company warned investors that the process could result in greater volatility than a traditional IPO.  In a direct listing, a company simply floats its shares on the stock market. Unlike in a typical IPO, there is no underwriting bank to act as a \u201cstabilizing agent\u201d and prop up the company\u2019s share price if it tumbles out of the gate. There are also no underwriters to market the company\u2019s shares to big investors ahead of the listing, a process called \u201cbook-building\u201d that helps gauge demand in a standard IPO.  \u201cWith a direct listing, you\u2019re coming into the process with less certain supply and demand,\u201d said Joe Mecane, head of execution services at Citadel Securities.  As Spotify\u2019s designated market maker at the New York Stock Exchange, Citadel Securities oversaw the opening of trading in Spotify\u2019s shares, in consultation with one of the company\u2019s financial advisers, Morgan Stanley.  Still, it remains to be seen how Spotify performs over the next few days. One of the other quirks of the direct-listing process is that \u201clock-up\u201d restrictions\u2013which restrict sales of shares by insiders in a normal IPO\u2013are much looser in the case of Spotify. That means shares in the music-streaming company could tumble if many of its existing shareholders decide to sell.", "stock": "BABA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-04-03", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2018/04/03/spotify-shakes-off-doubters-with-smooth-debut/"}, {"article": "Ant Financial\u2019s mascot on display in an office in Hangzhou, China.

BIDU -1.37% has filed for an initial public offering in the U.S., promoting its ability to use artificial intelligence and user data to deliver videos that generate billions of views.  In a U.S. regulatory filing, Baidu said it would list iQiyi on the Nasdaq exchange and is seeking to raise around $1.5 billion. Analysts at Jefferies have valued iQiyi at $17 billion.  The move comes as Baidu looks to raise money for the loss-making unit to stay ahead in the fiercely competitive video-streaming sector where tech titans Tencent Holdings Ltd. TCEHY -3.15% and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA -2.21% also have strong plays. Baidu told investors in its most recent earnings call that it would remain iQiyi\u2019s controlling shareholder.  IQiyi, which was founded in 2010 and will list under the ticker IQ, said it is China\u2019s largest video-streaming service by amount of time spent watching, with more than 50 million paid subscribers.  Two of its original series, \u201cThe Mystic Nine\u201d and \u201cBurning Ice,\u201d have together garnered more than 13 billion views, the company said in its filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  \u201cWe distinguish ourselves in the online entertainment industry by our leading technology platform powered by advanced AI, big data analytics and other core proprietary technologies,\u201d the company said in its filing. \u201cOur core proprietary technologies are critical to producing content that caters to user tastes, delivering superior entertainment experience to our users.\u201d  In China, people spend the majority of their online-entertainment time on video, and the market overall is expected to grow to 688 billion yuan ($109 billion) by 2022, up from about 51 billion yuan in 2012, iQiyi said, citing a report by iResearch Consulting Group.  But a tough competitive environment and the costs of providing content have made streaming a money-losing proposition for Baidu, as well as for its internet rivals Tencent and Alibaba.  \u201cWe incurred net losses since our inception,\u201d iQiyi said in its filing, including losses of 3.7 billion yuan in 2017.  Junwen Woo, a senior analyst at IHS Markit who tracks online video in Asia, said iQiyi has potential because of its use of AI, which helps the company differentiate from competing Chinese video platforms operated by much bigger rivals Alibaba and Tencent.  \u201cThey can know what is the most popular content and what are the most favorite things viewers like\u2014and what is coming up next,\u201d she said.  In fundraising last year, iQiyi raised $1.53 billion, an investment that came months after investors balked at a $2.3 billion buyout bid from a group led by Baidu Chief Executive Robin Li, saying the proposal undervalued the unit.

The Tongzhou Wanda Plaza shopping mall in Beijing is operated by Dalian Wanda Group Co., which is controlled by Chinese billionaire Wang Jianlin. Photo: Tomohiro Ohsumi/Bloomberg News  An investor group that includes China\u2019s Tencent Holdings Ltd. and online retailer JD.com Inc. JD -1.97% is spending 34 billion yuan ($5.37 billion) for a 14% stake in Chinese billionaire Wang Jianlin\u2019s commercial-property company as he faces a deadline to relist the business in China.  Wanda, China\u2019s largest mall developer, is benefiting from an escalating war for consumers and data between Tencent and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA -2.21% , the country\u2019s two largest internet companies.  Alibaba has already established several partnerships with department-store and supermarket chains in China, and is seeking to integrate online retail with physical stores.  Tencent has invested in Alibaba\u2019s online shopping rival JD.com, and the deal announced Monday gives both a partner in China\u2019s shopping-mall business as they seek to blunt Alibaba\u2019s move into physical stores. The traditional stores are seen as a way to attract new customers and, for Tencent and Alibaba, as a means to expand their mobile payment platforms.  \u201cThe deal represents one of the world\u2019s largest single strategic investments between internet companies and brick-and-mortar commercial giants,\u201d parent company Dalian Wanda Group and the others said in a joint release. Other investors include electronics retailer Suning Commerce Group and fellow property developer Sunac Holdings Ltd.  This month, Tencent signed a partnership agreement with French retailer Carrefour S.A. and a local supermarket chain, agreeing to take a stake in Carrefour\u2019s Chinese entity. In Shanghai, it also is testing an unmanned pop-up store with consumers using mobile payments to complete the sale.  JD will invest 5 billion yuan into Wanda Commercial Properties Co., the company said in a regulatory filing. JD took part in the deal to create multichannel approaches to shopping, a JD spokesman said.  In announcing the investment, Wanda said the aim was to speed up the adoption of its \u201casset-light\u201d model that would allow it to earn income from managing properties instead of owning them.  Wanda Commercial raised 34.5 billion Hong Kong dollars ($4.34 billion) from private investors to delist the company\u2019s Hong Kong shares in 2016, in the biggest take-private deal on the city\u2019s exchange. Wanda\u2019s aim was to relist the company in China, where big appetite from retail investors helps companies fetch higher valuations.  Last year, Wanda came under fire from Beijing for its aggressive overseas deal-making, which curtailed the company\u2019s ability to pay for overseas acquisitions and repay debt. To shore up its balance sheet, the company since has sold billions of dollars in assets both in China and abroad. Wanda\u2019s Hong Kong-listed unit said Monday in a regulatory filing that it was selling two Australian real-estate projects as part of those efforts.  Wanda faced a September deadline to relist Wanda Commercial or repay investors in full plus interest of up to 10%, a person familiar with the transaction said.  The investors\u2019 stake, which collectively equals 14%, will be transferred to the new group and could clear a path for regulators to approve Wanda Commercial\u2019s relisting in Shanghai. The sale also represents a 22% premium over what investors originally paid to delist the stake.

TCEHY -3.15% \u2014dominant forces in e-commerce, mobile payments and social media\u2014now are elbowing their way into autos, threatening established car makers.  These three companies\u2014the so-called BATs\u2014are plowing millions of dollars into electric-vehicle startups, car-sharing services and online retailers, as well as software platforms for autonomous driving and online car selling.  U.S. tech companies, notably Alphabet Inc. and its self-driving car unit Waymo, also are pushing into the auto sector. But the BAT companies have a big advantage in China, where tight government internet controls make it difficult for foreign enterprises to compete. For example, non-Chinese companies aren\u2019t allowed to operate digital mapping systems needed for autonomous driving.  BAT-Mobiles Chinese tech giants Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent have become major players in the auto business. Their interests span from electric-vehicle startups to smartcar software and online retail channels. Major BAT activities since 2013 Baidu Baidu Alibaba Alibaba Tencent Tencent Filter by Type All Partnership Software EV Ride-hailing Car-retail \u2014 TAP HOVER FOR DETAIL\u2014 Sources: Dealogic, staff reports  That has prompted both foreign and domestic auto companies like Ford Motor Co. , BMW AG , SAIC Motor Corp. and Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co. to seal tech partnerships with the BAT firms. This month, Renault SA said it is aiming for a fivefold increase in Chinese sales by 2023 as the result of a deal to sell cars on Alibaba\u2019s online retail platforms. Renault also said it would start using Alibaba\u2019s connectivity software in its cars in China.  The threat posed by China\u2019s internet giants was underscored when Li Shufu, the founder of Zhejiang Geely, announced last month that the company would invest $9 billion in a 9.7% stake in Mercedes-Benz parent Daimler AG .  \u201cThe competitors that challenge the global car industry in the 21st century technologically are not part of the automotive industry today,\u201d Mr. Li said in a statement. \u201cNo current car industry player will be able to win this battle against the invaders from outside independently.\u201d  Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent are betting that the auto industry is going to shift from selling hardware to selling services, with revenues derived mainly from selling subscriptions to features like shared autonomous vehicles and high-speed mobile internet.  \u201cThe BATs want people in cars using their online services. They see mobility as an on-ramp into their ecosystems,\u201d said Bill Russo, an ex-Chrysler executive who now runs Shanghai consultancy Automobility. \u201cSo they\u2019re all actively investing in mobility... This is a game that\u2019s not happening anywhere else. It\u2019s what makes China so unique.\u201d  Baidu Chief Executive Robin Li has made developing self-driving cars a priority for the search and mapping company. \u201cIn future commutes, you won\u2019t have to focus much on driving anymore,\u201d he said, on the sidelines of China\u2019s annual legislative session in Beijing this week. \u201cYou\u2019ll be able to have hot pot and sing karaoke on the ride.\u201d  Chen Hong, chairman of SAIC Motor, China\u2019s biggest car maker, speaking separately at the legislative session, acknowledged the tech giants\u2019 threat but said traditional auto makers have an edge in understanding drivers and their needs.  Still, these auto makers need partners. SAIC has launched an internet-connected car powered by AliOS, Alibaba\u2019s in-car operating system. Two big state-run car makers, Beijing Auto and Guangzhou Auto, are developing similar so-called smartcars with Baidu and Tencent respectively. Last year, Ford and BMW both said they, too, would launch smartcars using Alibaba\u2019s software.  The BATs are also generously bankrolling startups that are making smartcars slated to hit the China market later this year.  Alibaba-backed startup Xpeng Motor\u2019s new G3 SUV comes loaded with maps, music apps, Mandarin voice recognition and even a camera mounted on the roof, for buyers looking to post their travels on social media. Alibaba\u2019s technology and its knowledge of the consumer, accrued over nearly two decades as China\u2019s biggest e-commerce player, is helping Xpeng develop and grow quickly, said founder Xiaopeng He.  Traditional car makers need the BATs\u2019 strategic insights in a fast-changing marketplace, said Freeman Shen, whose electric-vehicle startup WM Motor is backed by Baidu and Tencent. Unless auto makers work with the BATs, said Mr. Shen, a former Geely executive, \u201cI don\u2019t think they can survive.\u201d  Baidu and Tencent are also investors in Shanghai-based NIO, whose debut electric vehicle has a voice-operated personal assistant, is able to park itself and comes loaded with apps provided by its two big tech backers.  The automobile is turning into a \u201cmobile living space,\u201d said NIO founder William Li. The passenger is a captive audience for internet services\u2014hence the BATs\u2019 interest in autos as potential channels for everything from online shopping to videogames to mobile TV.  All three companies have also invested in Didi Chuxing, China\u2019s answer to Uber. And Tencent, hedging its bets beyond China, last year bought 5% of Tesla Inc . for $1.78 billion.  For now, auto makers and tech companies can coexist by marrying car-making expertise with software innovation. \u201cWhen you put these two together you get a fantastic chemical reaction,\u201d said Simon Hu, who runs Alibaba\u2019s AliOS car operating-system division.  But as China\u2019s tech giants permeate the auto industry from all angles, the big question is: How much of the sector\u2019s revenues will they manage to commandeer? \u201cThe BATs have the bucks required to get into this game and stay in the game for however long it takes to win,\u201d said Michael Dunne, a Hong Kong-based auto consultant.  \u2014Yoko Kubota in Beijing contributed to this article.

So last week, he picked up the car for a three-day test drive from a vending machine.  Mr. Zhou never visited a dealership or spoke to a salesperson. He booked the test drive online, then showed up at a service center where employees can identify would-be buyers using facial-recognition technology. His SUV was then delivered from the eight-story \u201cvending machine\u201d\u2014essentially an automated parking garage.  \u201cThis is so much more efficient and convenient than traditional dealerships,\u201d said Mr. Zhou, 38 years old.  It\u2019s the first of several such car-vending centers that Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. plans to open across China this year\u2014part of the company\u2019s latest effort to translate its success in online retailing to the physical shopping world.  Alibaba is betting on the experiment to succeed in China, where consumers have enthusiastically embraced the e-commerce economy. Mr. Zhou buys clothes, home appliances and even the construction materials needed for his recent home renovation without going into a traditional store.  At Alibaba\u2019s auto vending center, a man requests delivery of a car. The center stands some 5 stories tall and contains more than 40 Ford vehicles. Photo: aleksandar plavecski/epa-efe/rex/EPA/Shutterstock  The car-vending concept has been tried in the U.S.\u2014with limited success. Carvana, a used-car dealer in Phoenix, has been operating such structures since 2013. Customers can search for, purchase, finance and trade-in vehicles online, then have the option of picking it up from a giant vending machine filled with cars.  But the model hasn\u2019t taken off more broadly in the U.S., where many consumers prefer to negotiate a deal in person, and have the salesperson help them with tasks such as pairing their smartphone with a car\u2019s Bluetooth, said David Sullivan, a Michigan-based analyst with AutoPacific Inc.  China\u2019s automotive retail climate is different\u2014and ripe for disruption, analysts say.  China\u2019s consumers, often first-time car buyers, are more open to trying out new concepts, said Dean Stoneley, Ford\u2019s Asia Pacific vice president for marketing. Ford has seen sales in China decline sharply in recent months as domestic competitors become more popular. Ford is now searching for new ways to engage customers, as more and more go online to do their car-buying research, Mr. Stoneley said.  \u201cA car vending machine is the ultimate word in frictionless commerce\u2014you don\u2019t have to deal with salespeople trying to talk you into things you don\u2019t want, and you don\u2019t have to haggle over price,\u201d said Jessica Wolfe, a principal in the Consumer and Retail practice of A.T. Kearney, a consulting firm. \u201cYou can think for yourself, do the research, and make the purchase when you\u2019re ready on your phone. That\u2019s exactly how millennials like to transact.\u201d  At the vending center, attendants are available to explain a car\u2019s basic features and to answer questions. Ford said each car has contact details of local dealerships where customers can go with questions or problems.  China\u2019s internet giants are experimenting with bringing the principles of e-commerce into other corners of the physical retail world as well. Just as Amazon.com Inc. is experimenting with unmanned supermarkets, Chinese e-commerce companies are taking stakes in malls and supermarkets, digitizing such operations as they seek growth beyond their core online retail business. In some cases, they\u2019re aiming to use the vast troves of data they have gleaned from e-commerce to change the way consumers shop in the real world.  Alibaba is experimenting with using augmented reality mirrors and vending machines in malls to allow consumers to \u201cvirtually\u201d try on various lipstick colors and buy them on the spot through Alibaba\u2019s online platforms.  JD.com Inc., which made its name in online ordering and delivery, is also getting into brick and mortar with a chain of clerkless convenience stores where shoppers can pay using facial-recognition technology.  Under the auto vending-machine program rolled out by Alibaba last week, customers go to Alibaba\u2019s Tmall website to book the test drive, which is free for those with high scores on the Sesame Credit rating system by Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial Services Group. Without a high credit score, consumers have to fork out 99 yuan ($16) to test-drive selected Ford sedans and 198 yuan for other models including a Ford Mustang sports car.  Alibaba is currently offering only Ford models, but it is in talks with other foreign and domestic brands to expand the inventory, said Lu Huan, the marketing director for Tmall\u2019s automotive division.  China is the world's largest market for electric vehicles, thanks largely to subsidies that drive costs down. Those incentives will end by 2020, but the government is betting that won't be the end of the road for its electric dream. Photo/Video: Eva Tam/The Wall Street \u200bJournal\u200b  The vending machine in Guangzhou saw brisk business on its first day of operation. In the first two days, Ford received 450 orders to test-drive the vehicle, Mr. Stoneley said. Ford declined to say if the new approach has resulted in any sales yet.  The vending machine helps to ease anxiety for potential car buyers, who are often tense when they enter a dealership expecting a hard sell, said James Chao, a Shanghai-based automotive consultant at IHS Markit.  Still, Mr. Chao said car brands face a challenge with this approach: Without a salesman, it may be tougher to convert a test drive to an actual sale, or to respond to customer feedback in the process.  \u201cWith extended test drives you don\u2019t have someone seated next to you, listening to your feedback and trying to overcome your objections,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons that the auto retail process has stayed the same in the last 30 years.\u201d  Write to Liza Lin at Liza.Lin@wsj.com", "stock": "BABA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-04-05", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/to-buy-a-car-in-china-hit-the-vending-machine-1522929642"}]
