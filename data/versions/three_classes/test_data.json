If growth slows, that balance sheet item will become harder to support.  Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.'s latest acquisition didn't come as a great surprise.  Between them, Alibaba and its affiliate Ant Small & Micro Financial Services Group Co. already owned 43 percent of food delivery service Ele.me.  Alibaba will take full control at an enterprise value of $9.5 billion, it said in a statement Monday, without stating the actual transaction price.  Goodwill Rising Alibaba's goodwill has climbed more than 10-fold after years of acquisitions Source: Bloomberg  As Alibaba's deal count climbs, so does the goodwill on its balance sheet. By the end of December it had surpassed $25 billion, more than 10 times the $1.9 billion held in March 2014. Since goodwill is the premium paid above a target's book value, the purchase of Ele.me should add to this balance.  This rising figure doesn't look quite as stark when you consider Alibaba's growth. As a percentage of total assets, goodwill ballooned in 2015 before stabilising over the next few years to now sit at around 23 percent. Ele.me will probably raise this ratio further.  It's All Relative Goodwill as a percentage of assets has stabilized over the past two years, although Alibaba's purchase of Ele.me could push that figure higher Source: Bloomberg  None of Alibaba's peers has a goodwill-to-asset ratio that comes anywhere close. Amazon.com Inc.'s stands at 10.2 percent, eBay Inc. at 18.4 percent and JD.com Inc. at a mere 3.6 percent. That may say as much about those firms' less-acquisitive natures, but for sure, $25 billion and a ratio approaching 25 percent is a large overhang.  Companies justify goodwill by pointing to the incremental profit or cash flow brought as a result of the deal. Alibaba's continued revenue and income growth would seem to justify its history of investments and takeovers.  But if the growth slows, or stops, that goodwill will become harder to support. That alone may be reason enough for Alibaba to tame its appetite.

Maybe not. Investors are starting to lose enthusiasm for some of what Alibaba and Tencent are buying, at least in the so-called \"new retail\" space.  Disappointed Better Life's shares tumbled after Tencent and its e-commerce partner JD.com bought strategic stakes. Source: Bloomberg  The latest example is Better Life Commercial Chain Share Co., with a market cap of $2.4 billion. This past weekend, the operator of supermarkets in China sold a 6 percent stake to Tencent in a 887 million-yuan ($141 million) transaction, and another 5 percent for 739 million yuan to Tencent's e-commerce partner JD.com Inc. Both deals were done at 17.11 yuan per share. But when Better Life resumed trading this week, its shares tumbled 8 percent in two days, against a broadly rising Shenzhen market.  The investor reaction when Alibaba bought 36 percent of Sun Art Retail Group Ltd. for $2.9 billion in November was muted, too.  Compare that with two years ago, when investors could hardly contain their excitement.  Suning.com Co., an electronics retailer, sold a 20 percent interest to Alibaba on Aug. 10, 2015, at 15.23 yuan per share -- a premium of only 5.8 percent to its average price the previous 20 trading days. That didn't stop Chinese investors pushing the stock up 40 percent in four days on speculation its backer would turn the store operator into a higher-margin, more valuable e-commerce proposition. Today, Suning is languishing at 12.37 yuan.  Perhaps people are finally realizing the tech giants may not have their affiliates' best interests at heart. Case in point: Last quarter, profits at Alibaba's \"equity investees\" (excluding Koubei Co., which helps people find restaurant deals) came in at only $105 million, not even 5 percent of the earnings at Jack Ma's flagship.  It may be that all Alibaba and Tencent want from their retail and logistics affiliates is data on shoppers and shippers. SmartKarma analyst Daniel Hellberg says that whether the startups perform well as financial investments \"is almost beside the point.\"  Indeed, stocks of Alibaba's own affiliates, including Alibaba Health Information Technology Ltd. and Alibaba Pictures Group, have underperformed the parent in the past year.

That move could bar some of the world\u2019s biggest titles from the Olympics, such as League of Legends and PlayerUnknown\u2019s Battlegrounds, which are both distributed by Alibaba\u2019s competitor Tencent Holdings Ltd. in China.

Game producers will need to be willing to share their intellectual property for free at the events, and the titles need to have a large fan base, according to Zhang.

This is as true in India as it is in Silicon Valley. Then there\u2019s Bigbasket, whose founders are veterans of the dotcom bust and mostly north of 50. Drawing on their successes and failures, they\u2019ve turned their six-year-old startup into India\u2019s biggest e-grocer and are taking on a host of competitors, including Amazon and brick-and-mortar chains operated by the nation\u2019s biggest conglomerates.  Bangalore-based Bigbasket delivers everyday cooking essentials like ghee (clarified butter), diced coconut and fragrant basmati rice, as well as 18,000 other items from bread to laundry detergent to eight million customers in 25 Indian cities. It\u2019s mostly targeting upwardly mobile young Indians keen to avoid traffic and the drudgery of supermarket runs. Last month, Bigbasket raised $300 million in an Alibaba-led round that valued the grocer at $950 million\u2014 just shy of unicorn status.  In a country where groceries account for half of the almost $1 trillion retail market, Bigbasket is using knowledge learned the hard way during the dotcom era (don\u2019t expand too quickly or use discounts to acquire shoppers) and latter-day innovation (putting vending machines inside apartment buildings; building a supply chain of competitively priced organic produce).  Founding members of Bigbasket. From left: VS Ramesh, Hari Menon, Vipul Parekh, Abhinay Choudhari and V.S. Sudhakar. Photographer: Samyukta Lakshmi/Bloomberg  \u201cWe want customers to get hooked, and make our service harder to replicate,\u201d says Hari Menon, 56, co-founder and chief executive officer. He, along with V.S. Sudhakar (58), Vipul Parekh (53), Abhinay Choudhari (47) and VS Ramesh (62), founded Bigbasket parent Supermarket Grocery Supplies Pvt, in December 2011 in a nondescript building in Bangalore\u2019s humming Indiranagar neighborhood.  Bigbasket's founders had their first brush with e-commerce back in 1999 when they started Fabmart.com to sell books, toys and groceries online. \u201cThose were the dial-up days, there were no payment gateways, and the internet user base was more hype than reality,\u201d recalls co-founder Sudhakar, standing in a Bigbasket warehouse where women shake soil from mounds of vegetables before packing them into ready-to-ship bundles. \u201cBack then, it\u2019d take 50 seconds for a page to download.\u201d  It didn\u2019t take the men long to realize that the world\u2014let alone India\u2014wasn\u2019t quite ready for online shopping, and they pivoted to physical stores under the name Fabmall. They soon merged with a brick & mortar grocery chain before getting acquired by another conglomerate. By 2006, the founders had sold out and begun angel investing.  In 2011, they were approached to regroup for an online grocery. Plenty of people told them to stay away from perishable produce in a country so obsessed with freshness that shoppers surreptitiously break okra tips and sink their fingernails into cucumbers. The founders pressed on all the same.  But their timing was propitious: smartphones were proliferating, broadband was becoming affordable, and online payments were in place. Even so, when they pitched the concept, venture firms kept bringing up Webvan, the Bay Area e-grocer that famously flamed out in 2001. The founders revised their pitch to make clear that enough had changed to make the venture viable, and eventually persuaded private equity investor Ascent Capital to put up $10 million.  Workers stock shelves at a Bigbasket warehouse in Bengaluru. Photographer: Samyukta Lakshmi/Bloomberg  Delivering fresh food is challenging everywhere, but India presents steeper obstacles. The country lacks a cooling infrastructure\u2014walk-in freezers, chill rooms, refrigerated trucks and so on. That precluded Bigbasket from buying produce directly from farms. So for the first year, every morning at 3:30, the founders visited a riotous wholesale fruits and vegetable market to buy produce, then picked up other items from a wholesaler. Eventually, Bigbasket put together its own refrigerated warehouses and a fleet of trucks. These moves let the company source the food more cheaply and eventually in 2016 led them to launch Express, a 90-minute delivery service for milk, eggs, bread and emergency supplies.  By investing in \u201cthe dysfunctional food and grocery supply chain,\u201d says Arvind Singhal, chairman of retail consultancy Technopak Advisors, \u201cBigbasket\u2019s managed to get a head start.\u201d  Still, there was a lot of competition, including LocalBanya, Sequoia-backed PepperTap and SoftBank-funded Grofers. (Of them, only Grofers is still standing.) To stay ahead, Bigbasket needed to invest in technology: web-connected, temperature-controlled trucks, GPS-traceable vans, inventory-optimizing algorithms. \u201cThe days of experimenting were over,\u201d says Parekh. \u201cWe needed to step on the pedal.\u201d This all cost money and by then venture firms were more willing to invest. Starting in the fall of 2014, Bigbasket began mopping up capital\u2014$35 million from Helion Venture Partners and Zodius Capital Advisors, $15 million from Bessemer Venture Partners, $150 million in a round led by Dubai-based Abraaj Group. By mid-2016, Bigbasket was in eight large Indian cities.  Then it was time to target smaller cities. To grab the attention of residents in burgs like Kanpur, Surat and Vijayawada, they recruited Bollywood star Shahrukh Khan as a spokesman. In one TV commercial, Khan lets shocked delivery boys in through the back door. When asked if he's the one who orders the groceries, Khan lowers his voice conspiratorially and says, \u201cThat's my role in the house.\u201d When they ask for his autograph, he says, \u201cYou'll be coming home every week from here on. We'll take a selfie next time.\u201d  Along the way, Bigbasket has constantly had to adapt to local conditions. Originally the company wanted one person to drive the trucks and carry the orders into homes. But the delivery boys (they\u2019re mostly male) didn\u2019t want to be seen as drivers because they\u2019re considered lower status in class-conscious India. So they had to hire one person for each job\u2014which turned out to be crucial because parking is scarce so the driver needs to circle the neighborhood. They also need backup workers on standby because delivery people and packers have a tendency to take time off to celebrate local cultural events. \u201cIf there\u2019s a festival, 30 delivery guys take off to their village and return after four days,\u201d Sudhakar says.  Workers bag and weigh bananas and red peppers. Photographer: Samyukta Lakshmi/Bloomberg  Attracting and keeping customers is a challenge for all e-commerce companies, and doubly so in India. Shopping habits vary widely from city to city and are deeply ingrained. So Bigbasket plies customers with samples: leafy greens in Mumbai, a rice called Sona Masoori in Bangalore. The company spent years figuring out how to achieve the ideal ripeness of bananas for its picky customers and devised exacting quality specifications for produce, including eight varieties of eggplant, and trained the sourcing team to meet them.  Customized software automatically guides drivers to their destinations, which the company says has helped it achieve a near-perfect on-time rate. Late deliveries earn customers a 10 percent discount. Missing items are refunded, plus 50 percent of whatever the item cost.  Seven hundred people handle customer complaints and answer 95 percent of calls within the third ring, Bigbasket says. Complaints range from missing items to delivery boys\u2019 hygiene. After getting one too many of these complaints, the founders mandated that their personnel wear clean shirts and open-toe sandals to suit the humid weather. \u201cA Bigbasket person visits a household an average 50 times a year so being presentable was supreme,\u201d Menon says.  A worker prepares a barcode sticker for a customer's order. Photographer: Samyukta Lakshmi/Bloomberg  Last year, the founders took stock of what they had achieved. Bigbasket was now in cities with a combined population of 150 million people, had good brand recall and was making money on each order. But, \u201cwe\u2019d barely scratched the surface of the cities we were already in,\u201d Menon says. \u201cIt was time to bring in a strategic partner.\u201d After initial conversations with Amazon, Walmart and others, the founders zeroed in on Alibaba, which runs a large online grocery business in China and has built its own delivery operations.  They\u2019re now preparing for the next phase of growth by plowing money into warehousing and delivery systems in the 25 cities to bring down delivery times to three hours. In two years, the plan is to double the range of products to 60,000 SKUs, and more than double the farmer base to 5,000, expand private label items and use Alibaba\u2019s muscle to source and import a range of merchandise to six times that of large-format supermarkets. \u201cA customer should be able to buy whatever he wants,\u201d Menon says.  Even as Amazon and local rival Flipkart push into groceries, Bigbasket\u2019s founders profess equanimity. Grocery is different from electronics or fashion and they\u2019re confident that strength in one category doesn\u2019t necessarily translate to another.Bigbasket is growing quickly and aims to double sales each year to hit $2 billion by 2020 to take the third spot in Indian retail. \u201cThey\u2019ve just gone past 100 meters in a 42-kilometer marathon,\u201d said Vishal Gupta, managing director of early investor Bessemer. \u201cThey have to hit the top spot and keep on running.\u201d", "stock": "BABA"}, {"url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2018-04-11/temasek-s-wearing-rose-tinted-glasses-with-ant-financial", "label": -1, "source": "bloomberg", "date": "2018-04-11", "article": "Temasek Holdings Pte has pretty high hopes for Ant Financial.  It wants to lead a round of funding that could value the Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.-backed company at $150 billion. The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg News reported on the deal Tuesday.  I assume Singapore's state investment firm expects significant upside on that. After leaving room for a profit at IPO and a public-trading bump, Temasek probably thinks Ant is worth at least $200 billion at listing, which means around $250 billion on public markets. That's a lot to ask.  In the final full year before its IPO, Alibaba generated $2.8 billion in net income attributable to ordinary shareholders. A survey of analysts came up with a valuation of $153 billion in March 2014, six months before the company's eventual debut. Alibaba closed on day one at $231 billion. Ant has produced a 13.2 billion yuan ($2.1 billion) profit over the past year, according to Bloomberg Gadfly calculations.  Steady On Ant Financial's profit has risen, but not steadily Source: Alibaba filings  Alibaba was able to grow into its valuation unimpeded, thanks to robust expansion of China's consumer sector and the rise of e-commerce. Three-and-a-half years later, it has a market cap of $454 billion. For Ant to follow the same trajectory it'll need to keep going deeper into the financial and personal lives of Chinese citizens, finding more ways to extract value in the form of commissions, fees or data.  Facebook Inc.'s Mark Zuckerberg was just schooled on the political risks of mishandling user information. And while China may view data privacy differently to the U.S., it would be a mistake to think the government takes a laissez-faire approach.  As fellow Gadfly Shuli Ren has pointed out, Ant faces numerous regulatory headwinds that cast doubt on the inevitability of any IPO. Competition, notably from Tencent Holdings Ltd., has also hurt, and contributed to a 90 percent drop in earnings in the December quarter after Ant spent big to lure new Alipay wallet users.  Unstable Ant Financial's earnings have been very up and down Source: Alibaba, Bloomberg Gadfly  Providing payments, credit scores and loans is also a more sensitive caper than selling toilet paper and televisions, which makes the very visible hand of the Chinese government one of Ant's biggest risks. There are several ways in which the People's Bank of China has rained on Ant's parade.  Even if Ant's profit rebounds, investors would be remiss to ignore these instabilities. Tencent provides stiffer competition to Ant than Alibaba ever faced as an e-commerce player in its pre-IPO days. And there are many other fintech firms ready to eat away at both giants.  Temasek may be right in betting on a bright future for Ant. But $150 billion makes you wonder if it's wearing rose-tinted glasses.

To be the first to know, please click here.  Alibaba reported its earnings for its fiscal Q3 2018 (ended December 31, 2017), which showed that its revenue grew 56% year-over-year (YoY) to $12.8 billion, its highest ever. Its core commerce continues to be the bulk of its business, bringing in $11.3 billion in the quarter, which is up 57% YoY.  The huge revenue numbers are partially due to Alibaba's performance during Singles' Day, which set records itself.  Alibaba saw the gross merchandise value (GMV) that was handled through Alipay on its marketplaces reach $25.9 billion on Singles' Day, up 39% YoY. It credits much of the sales holiday's success to its logistics and payments capabilities, which helped process as many as 325,000 orders per second. This suggests that Alibaba's move to work with and upgrade approximately 600,000 smaller physical retailers for Singles' Day paid off. These locations served as delivery and storage locations for Alibaba, and were outfitted with technologies like facial-recognition payments, helping Alibaba handle the incredible level of consumer demand, and displaying the value that brick-and-mortar locations can have for Alibaba.  Alibaba's \"New Retail\" initiatives are showing promising results, and it's preparing to expand them across China. Alibaba's category that includes New Retail initiatives\u2014 its efforts to imbue brick-and-mortar retail with technology and intertwine it with e-commerce \u2014 is still small, bringing in $129 million this quarter, but it's growing at a clip of 525% YoY. The company is working to further this promising growth by continuing to invest in physical retail, adding five new locations for its high-tech Hema grocery stores, bringing the number of locations to 25. Additionally, it recently made a $2.9 billion investment in hypermarket operator Sun Art Retail Group for a 36% stake in the company. Alibaba says its investment in Sun Art is part of its preparations to expand its New Retail initiatives on a national scale, which could be a boon for the company.  The e-commerce competition between Alibaba and JD.com is set to spill into brick-and-mortar. While Alibaba is working with convenience stores and looking to bring its retail innovations across China, JD.com is preparing to open hundreds of unmanned stores, and Tencent, its largest stakeholder, is making investments akin to Alibaba's in Sun Art. Both competitors are looking to bolster their performances online and in-store with these expansions, and they're likely to butt heads for the foreseeable future across channels.

AP  Kroger is in talks with Alibaba about a potential partnership, a source with knowledge of the situation told Business Insider.  Alibaba could be lobbying to get Kroger to accept Alipay, its online payment system.  Kroger could also be consulting with Alibaba about ways it can market and sell its products to Chinese consumers.  An outright acquisition would give Alibaba a physical-store footprint in the US that's about six times the size of Amazon's.  Alibaba could overtake Amazon's push into retail stores in one move.  The Chinese e-commerce giant is in talks with the supermarket chain Kroger about a potential partnership, a person with knowledge of the situation confirmed to Business Insider. This could take many forms:  Alibaba could be lobbying to get Kroger to accept Alipay, its online payment system. That would give Chinese tourists who are shopping in the US an easy way to check out at the nation's largest grocer.  Kroger could also be consulting with Alibaba about ways it can market and sell its products to Chinese consumers, like the warehouse chain Costco did in 2014.  Alibaba could outright acquire Kroger, which would give Alibaba access to the grocer's nearly 2,800 stores in the US.  A press release issued by the Chinese government last week and first noticed by the New York Post said Kroger and Alibaba were already working together.  \"Alibaba has teamed up with Kroger, Yintai, and RT-Mart to speed up the integration of online and offline sales,\" says the release on comments from an official with China's Ministry of Commerce.  The Post was also the first to report on the companies' discussions about forming an alliance.  An Alibaba spokesman said: \"Alibaba has dialogue with hundreds of businesses around the world every day about expanding commercial relationships and reaching Chinese consumers, and Kroger is an example of just that.\"  Kroger declined to comment.  Amazon shook up the grocery industry last year when it purchased Whole Foods for $13.7 billion. The deal represented Amazon's biggest commitment yet to physical retail, as the purchase included Whole Foods' nearly 500 stores.  A deal with Kroger could give Alibaba access to Kroger's nearly 2,800 US stores, the country's biggest network of traditional grocery stores, creating a physical-store footprint about six times the size of Amazon's.  'Kryptonite to Amazon Whole Foods and Walmart/Jet.com'  Kroger says it plans to add digital-shelf technology to nearly 200 stores this year. Kroger  Brittain Ladd, a Kroger consultant, wrote about the possibility of a Kroger-Alibaba partnership in a LinkedIn post published in June.  \"I believe Alibaba should acquire Kroger as a way to enter the USA, as well as extend and complement their global retail ecosystem,\" he wrote. \"A combined Kroger and Alibaba would prove to be Kryptonite to Amazon Whole Foods and Walmart/Jet.com, while adding substantial value to Kroger customers.\"  In the LinkedIn post, Ladd suggested that Kroger could license Alipay or launch Alibaba's Hema supermarkets in the US. Hema markets are similar to Amazon's cashier-less Amazon Go stores.  Kroger has been working on adding more digital features to its stores. The grocery chain is rolling out a new service called Scan, Bag, Go to 400 stores. It's designed to enable shoppers to scan their groceries with mobile phones or other handheld devices while they shop.  Eventually, Kroger says, the technology will also allow customers to pay for the items with their phones \u2014 which is where Alipay could come in.  Kroger says it also plans to add digital-shelf technology to nearly 200 stores this year. The technology, called Kroger Edge, is designed to replace paper price tags with digital displays showing a product's price and nutritional information, as well as video ads and coupons.", "stock": "BABA"}, {"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/04/04/alibaba-grab/", "label": -1, "source": "techcrunch", "date": "2018-04-05", "article": "Fresh from announcing a deal to buy out Uber in Southeast Asia, Grab looks set to gain further firepower with Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba preparing to invest in the ride-hailing firm.  Alibaba is in the early stages of making an investment in Grab, two sources with knowledge of discussions told TechCrunch. Isn\u2019t yet clear what size that might be or at what valuation for Grab, which was last valued by investors at $6 billion.  In addition, the timing is unclear due to current anti-trust investigations into the Grab-Uber deal. The Competition Commission of Singapore has said there are grounds to believe the merger may violate the law, while other countries are looking into its implications. But still, there is intent from both sides and key investor SoftBank to make the deal.  Grab declined to comment for this story. An Alibaba spokesperson said the company \u201cdoesn\u2019t confirm on market rumors.\u201d  Alibaba and Grab first held talks over an investment last summer but a deal never materialized after the Chinese firm became pre-occupied chasing an investment in Tokopedia, the Indonesia-based e-commerce unicorn. That deal was prioritized because Alibaba\u2019s arch-rival Tencent was in advanced talks over an investment that could give it a foothold in Indonesia, Southeast Asia\u2019s largest economy and the world\u2019s fourth most populous country.  Alibaba leaned heavily on its long-time ally SoftBank \u2014 an early backer of Tokopedia and Grab \u2014 to get the Tokopedia deal ahead of Tencent. That\u2019s despite Tokopedia\u2019s own founders\u2019 preference for Tencent due to Alibaba\u2019s ownership of Lazada, an e-commerce rival to Tokopedia. SoftBank, however, forced the deal through.  \u201cIt was literally SoftBank against every other investor,\u201d a separate source with knowledge of negotiations told TechCrunch.  Ultimately, Alibaba was successful and it led a $1.1 billion investment in Tokopedia in August which did not include Tencent.  TechCrunch understands that one condition SoftBank attached to the Tokopedia deal was that Alibaba would invest in Grab when the time was right. SoftBank is widely seen to have been the deal-maker in the recent Grab-Uber consolidation and now, with that transaction agreed, Alibaba\u2019s investment will follow.  The timing may be ideal for Grab. While it has plenty of money in the bank from past investments, Indonesian rival Go-Jek is preparing to expand into regional markets so the firm will need to brace itself for a new wave of competition.  Despite the background, this is far from Alibaba being strong-armed into an investment, a deal with Grab makes plenty of sense for the firm.  It has been actively seeking investment deals in Southeast Asia\u2019s top internet companies for some time, and Grab clearly fits the bill. In particular, Grab\u2019s focus on payments and its recently announced financial services play is aligned with Alibaba and its fintech arm Ant Financial\u2019s goals, too.  Last year, Ant Financial went on an investment spree which included multiple investments deals across Southeast Asia and the failed acquisition of MoneyGram. Involvement in Grab Pay, which is shaping up to be a major payment player across the region, would massively boost Alibaba and Ant\u2019s objective.  Finally, there\u2019s the good old competition factor. With Tencent an investor in Grab rival Go-Jek, Alibaba has motivation enough to back a horse in Southeast Asia\u2019s ride-hailing space.  As I wrote last year, the two Chinese internet giants have been carving up Southeast Asia\u2019s most promising startups in search of investments that give them a good position as the region\u2019s internet economy grows.  A report co-authored by Google last year forecast that Southeast Asia\u2019s internet economy will grow to $200 billion in 2025 from $50 billion in 2017. Right now, it is Chinese companies, not those from the U.S., that are seizing the opportunity.  Got a news tip?

Alibaba said in a press announcement that Youku and the other OTT platforms it will distribute Disney animations on will cover about 30 million households.

The deal, which both parties said stems from an agreement made in 2014, will see Alibaba pick up newly issued shares in Ant, seemingly paving the way for a public listing. It will also mark an end to a profit-share agreement which saw Ant give Alibaba \u201croyalty and technology service fees\u201d equal to 37.5 percent of its pre-tax profits each quarter.

Ant and Alibaba have long collaborated together \u2014 including joint participation in investments such as Paytm in India \u2014 and this new allocation of shares is another hint that Ant may be in line to go public soon. Ant had been tipped to list last year, but it instead opted to take on $3 billion in debt financing to bankroll a series of expansions that set up financial services products in Southeast Asia, Japan, Korea and beyond. A move into the U.S. fell apart, however, when it was unable to secure governmental approval for a proposed $1.2 billion acquisition of cross-border payment provider MoneyGram.

JD.com, the nearest e-commerce competitor to Alibaba in China, has reported its first year of profitability as a public company.

It's been a long time coming considering the fact that Magic Leap has been in development for five years now, with nothing but conceptual ideas to show.  Clearly investors believe in the timeline behind Magic Leap. It's attracted hundreds of millions of dollars from companies like Google and Alibaba.  We'll continue to track the Magic Leap release date as we all get closer to donning the first developer AR glasses in public.  What is available now is a Technical Preview of the Creators Portal and SDK for developers. This provides tools and resources on which to create content for Magic Leap One, which is a good sign the mixed reality glasses are inching closer to a release date.  Magic Leap One price  If you were holding out for a low price, you might want to sit down. The Magic Leap price will be similar to a \"higher-end mobile phone to higher-end tablet\" for the cheapest version.  This is according to Magic Leap CEO Rony Abovitz, who revealed this information in an interview with Recode in February. Abovitz didn't object to the Magic Leap price being compared to the iPhone X, which costs 1,000 or \u00a31,000 to start.  Image 1 of 3 Image 2 of 3 Image 3 of 3  And that's just for the Magic Leap starting price. The CEO said the Creator Edition will be priced somewhere in the range of the Microsoft HoloLens, which is $3,000 or \u00a32,719.  The justification for this high price? Magic Leap One is meant to replace many devices, not just, say, a smartphone, thus saving you thousands in the long-run. By comparison, the Google Glass price was $1,500 (\u00a31,000, about AU$1,956), and it promised less.  The future is often exciting, and also more times than not very expensive. Also, Magic Leap doesn't have many competitors in the AR glasses space, so it's free to set its own price. The question is: will developers and consumers be buying?  How to buy Magic Leap One  When Magic Leap One: Creator Edition does go on sale, there's a good chance you'll fit into one of the categories they're targeting.  So far, creators include developers, brands, agencies and even early adopter consumers, according to Rolling Stone, comparing the glass's potential audience to the sort of people who bought the first iPod.  In other words, this developer kit won't be limited to the developer community. It's going after consumer content creators, too.  Lightwear goggles  Magic Leap One is more than just a pair of AR glasses with a camera on it (see: Snapchat Spectacles and its less-than-a-year popularity span).  \u201cIt\u2019s what we think of as spatial computing. It has full awareness,\u201d according to founder Rony Abovitz in the Rolling Stone piece. Think Microsoft Hololens, but with a slightly larger field of view.  How does Magic Leap One work? It uses lightfield photonics to generate digital light at different depths and blend seamlessly with natural light to produce lifelike digital objects that coexist in the real world.  In other words, it's supposed to fool your brain into thinking the virtual objects set against real-world environments all look natural. That's going to make it more comfortable to wear the Lightwear goggles for a longer period of time.  Magic Leap is particularly working on expanding the field of view in its glasses and determined to make it comfortable to wear. Even if the bulky AR glasses look a bit awkward, they should feel good wearing for a few hours.  Lightpack computing platform  Not all of Magic Leap One is contained in the Lightwear goggles. The computing power is relegated to a Lightpack that fits in a pocket or, if you really want to look uncool, it can be clipped to a belt.  But you can't get away with using Magic Leap One without this spatial computing platform. While the company isn't talking about CPU and GPU chips, this disk-shaped \"computer\" is where the high-powered processing takes place.  It does have a cable, but at least you're not tied to a computer or a backpack VR kit, like we've seen from other high-end virtual reality headsets.  Controller  Interacting with the new, virtually overlain world around you is done through rather traditional means: a familiar-looking motion controller.  Control \u2013 what Magic Leap is calling its controller \u2013 is a remote that contains buttons, six-degrees of freedom motion sensing and a touchpad. There's also haptic feedback, according to the official Magic Leap website.  The remote-shaped controller appears to be very similar to what we've experienced on Samsung Gear VR and Google Daydream headset controllers.  The AR future is now  Magic Leap content ranges from games to music experiences to Oculus Connect-like digital collaborations so far, and these are being billed as \"just a jumping-off point\" for creators.  The company wants you to be able to pull the web out of the screen, with 3D virtual objects and be able to open up multiple screens on demand.  That long-sought-after goal of a Minority Report future may be within our grasp in 2018. Whether or not Magic Leap One can deliver that remains to be seen. But we're at least a whole lot closer to that exciting (augmented) reality.", "stock": "BABA"}, {"url": "https://www.engadget.com/2018/03/15/tech-giants-google-alibaba-save-endangered-species/", "label": -1, "source": "engadget", "date": "2018-03-15", "article": "Now, 21 tech giants from North America, Europe, Asia and Africa are taking a stand as the first businesses to join the Global Coalition to End Wildlife Trafficking Online, which has issued a pledge to reduce this illegal trade online by 80 percent by 2020.  The coalition is spearheaded by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), TRAFFIC and the International Fund for Animal Welfare. They'll collaborate directly with these tech companies in drawing up action plans to take on trafficking threats and offering staff trainings to pinpoint illegal sales.  Giavanna Grein, program officer for wildlife crime for TRAFFIC at WWF, said this will happen in two phases. First, companies will share what they have learned about addressing specific trade threats so they can learn from one another. Then, each company will develop a plan for its sites or apps.  \"Law enforcement alone cannot police the open web globally due to the sheer scale of online trade and their limited resources,\" Crawford Allan, senior director for wildlife crime at TRAFFIC at WWF, told Engadget. \"We realized if the companies can remove ads before they are posted or can look out for organized criminals that they can report to law enforcement, this will really help tackle the problem rapidly.\"  Allan said this coalition is the first of its kind, especially among companies that would traditionally be seen as competitors. Beyond Google and Alibaba, organizations that have joined the coalition are Baidu, Baixing, eBay, Etsy, Facebook, Huaxia Collection, Instagram, Kuaishou, Mall for Africa, Microsoft, Pinterest, Qyer, Ruby Lane, Shengshi Collection, Tencent, Wen Wan Tian Xia, Zhongyikupai, Zhuanzhuan and 58 Group.  When they asked these companies to be part of the coalition, WWF, TRAFFIC and IFAW laid out the issues around wildlife trade and the role of these sites in facilitating illegal trade and explained how the companies can combat this activity by setting up closed-door workshops among the businesses. You might assume it would be a challenge to corral all these competitors, but Allan said they were all willing to confront the issue as an industry.  Officials stand by a one-horned rhinoceros that was killed and de-horned by poachers in Kaziranga India, 2017.  From the tech perspective, this coalition builds on efforts to fight illegal trafficking online. Mike Carson, eBay's senior manager of global policy and regulatory management, told Engadget the retail site established a global ivory ban back in 2008. It has been working to flag and scrub listings from criminal traders, and said 45,000 illegal wildlife listings were blocked or removed last year alone.  Carson said eBay had been working with WWF, TRAFFIC and IFAW to train employees. He said he is looking forward to working with industry peers to combat the trade, but said there's always room for improvement: eBay will build on these policies through the coalition and \"define a set of areas\" where wildlife trafficking seems to be most prevalent on the site.  A big part of the coalition's work will be to educate consumers about the importance of avoiding goods like ivory that were most likely the result of illegal poaching, Carson said.  Carved pieces of confiscated ivory before being crushed in New York, 2015.  \"There should be a negative stigma attached to the purchase and sale of illegal wildlife products, just as there is for other illegal items like drugs or weapons,\" he added.  Consumer awareness is key, said Susan Lieberman, vice president of international policy at the Wildlife Conservation Society, which isn't part of the coalition.  \"You aren't going to a shopping mall -- you are buying from the comfort of home, rather anonymously. When people are home on their computers there needs to be more awareness raised among the average customer,\" she said. \"The customer needs to know that it is illegal. When companies start these awareness campaigns, it's not about nice brochures but making sure people can't even find these items to begin with. You have to make it harder for [traders].\"  She said shoppers who have doubts about an item's provenance should just not buy it -- something like a rhino horn should be a no-brainer.  Lieberman has spent 30 years monitoring wildlife trade, and said that in the past governments could target brick-and-mortar shops selling illegal goods, but internet has led to something of a free-for-all.  She said she doesn't think tech companies have done enough in the past to put an end to this, but this coalition is a step in the right direction.  \"Social media has just made it easy -- too easy -- for this kind of illegal activity. Good things are easier, too, but we just need to make sure it is extremely hard for people to buy and sell endangered species,\" Lieberman added.  Allan believes once companies start stepping up enforcement on their platforms, criminals will move more of their operations to the \"dark web,\" which will hopefully shrink their audience and stem sales.  It might be impossible to make this criminal activity go extinct, but the coalition is a step in the right direction of saving some of the Earth's most precious species.

Or otherwise underserved and rural communities that may not have access to internet connections, smartphones or even checking accounts? You know, all the things that Amazon's new store demands of shoppers just to get in the door.  As our economy embraces digital transactions while shunning cash, it's the poor that will be most harmed. \"There are many people who are unbanked and cannot receive lines of credit for a whole range of reasons,\" Rainey Reitman, activism director at the Electronic Frontiers Foundation, told Fast Company, \"and a ban on cash would particularly impact the unbanked community.\"  This community is not a small one. According to a 2014 Gallup poll, 29 percent of Americans don't have a credit card. What's more, according to the 2013 U.S. Survey of Consumer Finance, 7.5 percent of American households don't have bank accounts at all -- that's nearly 24 million people. Worldwide, 38 percent of the global population does not have access to a conventional bank account, roughly 2 billion adults. That figure has been shrinking steadily since 2011, per the World Bank, yet more than half of adults in the poorest 40 percent of households in developing countries lack access to a bank account as of 2014. For them, cash is the only way they can participate in the economy.  However, dealing in cash is costly to banks. Storing, processing and transferring stacks of cash is far more expensive for financial institutions than simply wiring digital funds, and those costs are often passed along to the customer.  Prepaid cards are one alternative to dealing in cash and a popular one for the unbanked community. In 2013, the FDIC found that among people without bank accounts, 22 percent had used a general purpose reloadable (GPR) prepaid card within the previous 12 months, compared to just five percent of people with accounts. These cards can be loaded either through direct deposit or cash and utilized like bank-issued debit cards for both online and offline purchases. And because consumers can't spend more money than the card is loaded with, it can serve as a helpful means of budgeting and controlling one's spending without the danger of overdraft fees.  However, GPR cards are not without their drawbacks. They are often saddled with numerous and steep fees for everything from using them to withdraw cash from ATMs to making online purchases -- even putting money on the card can come with a fee. What's more, these fees vary widely between providers, yet according to a 2015 Pew Charitable Trust study, only around a third of consumers actually compare the fees and features of various cards before purchasing them.  Mobile money accounts are another emerging alternative to traditional bank accounts. Mobile money is essentially an electronic wallet that allows users to send and receive funds using their phone. The technology has taken hold in both Sub-Saharan Africa and China, where Alibaba reported in 2014 that more than half of its transactions were made on mobile devices using its Alipay digital wallet. The number of adults in that region with any type of financial account rose from 24 to 34 percent between 2011 and 2014, a 10 percent increase in a region where two-thirds of adults still have no form of financial account at all.  But even as prepaid cards and mobile money accounts move into the mainstream of financial services, they are not a permanent solution to the problems facing the unbanked community. Eventually, government action may prove necessary.  \"Clearly you're going to need a way to get everybody into the system if you're going to get rid of cash,\" Susan Athey, the Economics of Technology Professor at Stanford Graduate School of Business, told Engadget in October. \"One of the things the government will have to do is ensure banking access to everyone.\"    Just as the FDIC offers insurance on both conventional bank accounts and prepaid cards, the government would not be remiss to require financial institutions to offer low-cost services like zero-interest checking accounts to their customers. Doing so would provide a direct means of entry into the world of digital finances for poorer people.  Doing so would also offer a slew of benefits to both consumers and their financial institutions. Previously unbanked customers would not only be able to more fully participate in the economy but also would then have access to safer and speedier financial transactions with less threat of corruption or theft. Meanwhile banks would be able to more accurately track a new set of customers' financial histories, thereby enabling them to create and market a new ecosystem of products such as microloans to these customers, according to the Gates Foundation Financial Services for the Poor program.  Amazon has already taken a number of steps to be as inclusive as it can when it comes to extracting money from its customers. This is the company that pioneered the Dash button (of which there are more than 250 varieties, both physical and digital), after all. For example, Amazon rolled out a new feature dubbed Amazon Pay Places last July, which enables users to pay for items at real-world stores, like TGI Fridays, and pay for them through their existing Amazon account with the mobile app.  What's more, the company already has a mechanism for paying for its wares with cash: It's this wild new thing the kids are calling gift cards, which can be purchased for physical currency at a variety of locations including Western Union, MoneyGram and Coinstar.  Additionally, the company has a separate program called Amazon Cash that enables users to pay their account balances at any of 16 different chains -- like 7-Eleven and GameStop -- by having the cashier swipe a bar code generated by their mobile app and handing over the appropriate amount of money. However, neither of these methods are quite as seamless or as streamlined as what Go shoppers with bank accounts experience, with each demanding a separate trip to a third-party vendor to make the currency exchange. And for the foreseeable future, that will simply be the cost of doing business for those living outside the formal banking system.

Photo: Mark Lennihan/Associated Press  Technology giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is working on a plan to list on a stock exchange in its home market, China, according to people familiar with the matter, more than three years after its blockbuster initial public offering in New York.  Alibaba is evaluating ways in which its shares could be traded by investors on the mainland, the people said. A secondary listing in China could happen as soon as this summer if the country\u2019s securities rules are changed to allow listings of foreign companies, one of the people added. While the bulk of Alibaba\u2019s business and operations are in China, the nearly 20-year-old company is incorporated in the Cayman Islands.  Chinese laws have long prohibited overseas companies from selling shares directly to local investors. China also currently forbids companies with shares that carry different voting rights to list on the mainland. Alibaba has a complex ownership structure that gives its founders and a small group of executives more control over the company than other shareholders.  The company in 2014 launched a $25 billion float on the New York Stock Exchange in what remains the world\u2019s largest IPO.  An Alibaba spokeswoman said the company has been considering a listing in China since 2014, if regulations would permit it.  Chinese authorities are trying to lure some of the country\u2019s technology stalwarts back to its capital markets. Alibaba\u2019s shares have climbed 86% over the past year and have more than doubled since their IPO, gains that investors in China have largely missed out on. The company now has a market capitalization of around $493 billion and is one of the world\u2019s most valuable technology firms.  In recent months, China\u2019s securities regulator has been in touch with several investment banks to discuss ways to allow companies listed abroad to issue securities on the mainland, the Journal previously reported.  Liu Shiyu, chairman of the Chinese securities regulator, recently confirmed the government has been working to win over overseas Chinese listings. \u201cYou will see results,\u201d he said on the sidelines of a legislative meeting in Beijing last week. \u201cA bit slower than the firms expect and a bit quicker than you expect,\u201d he added.  Noting that Chinese investors haven\u2019t been able to profit from the share gains of some foreign-listed companies that he didn\u2019t identify, Mr. Liu called it \u201ca pity, a real pity\u201d and said this \u201ccannot happen again.\u201d China\u2019s securities regulator didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment Thursday.  Some of the regulator\u2019s discussions with banks have revolved around the creation of financial instruments called depositary receipts, which represent interests in the shares of foreign-listed companies.  Enticing Chinese tech companies trading abroad, such as Alibaba, Baidu Inc. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. , to list at home has become a national priority in recent months.  Chinese regulators want large homegrown companies and promising startups to participate in its capital markets, giving retail investors an opportunity to tap into the wealth generated by successful companies, among other goals. Tencent, whose shares have also doubled over the past year, is listed in Hong Kong, while Baidu is listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market.  A dual listing on the mainland would give Chinese companies the option of raising money domestically in their local currency and help boost their profile at home, said Rocky Lee, managing partner of the Silicon Valley office of law firm King & Wood Mallesons. He added that well-known companies could potentially fetch higher valuations for their shares from local investors, because their brands and businesses are better known domestically.  However, China\u2019s stock market has historically had a reputation for being akin to a casino, and some analysts have said the listings of a few hot names could fuel speculation by Chinese individual investors, who dominate trading in the markets.  From the Archives Alibaba is China\u2019s largest e-commerce company but it does a lot more than just sell toys and clothes. The WSJ\u2019s Ken Brown explains how Alibaba\u2019s network of interconnected products and services have led them to become the biggest e-commerce company in China. (Originally Published May 4, 2014)  China\u2019s securities regulator is expected to announce plans for a depositary share regime in the coming months, said people familiar with discussions it has had recently.  Depositary receipts are a common feature of major stock markets in the U.S. and Europe. Dozens of Chinese companies that are listed on the NYSE or Nasdaq have American depositary receipt programs typically administered by large banks.  In the case of Baidu, every 10 American depositary shares represent an interest in one of the internet company\u2019s class A ordinary shares. Alibaba\u2019s New York-listed securities are also American depositary shares, with each representing one ordinary share.  Another tech company that is considering listing in China as well as overseas is smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp., people familiar with the matter previously told the Journal. The homegrown company is planning to raise at least $10 billion in an initial public offering later this year, and has picked Hong Kong as its main listing venue but is also considering a concurrent listing on the mainland at the behest of Chinese authorities, the people said. Xiaomi\u2019s parent company is also incorporated in the Cayman Islands, and to list in China it may also have to use a depositary receipt structure.  \u2014Chao Deng contributed to this article  Write to Julie Steinberg at julie.steinberg@wsj.com and Liza Lin at Liza.Lin@wsj.com", "stock": "BABA"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chairman-of-alibaba-affiliate-ant-financial-steps-down-1523266283", "label": 1, "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "date": "2018-04-09", "article": "Lucy Peng will focus on running Lazada Group, an operator of online retail marketplaces in Southeast Asia that Alibaba invested $2 billion in.

Photo: Misha Friedman/Bloomberg News  Lucy Peng, one of China\u2019s richest businesswomen, is leaving the helm of one of the country\u2019s most valuable private companies.  Ms. Peng, 44 years old, stepped down as executive chairman of Ant Financial Services Group, the giant financial-technology affiliate of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA -2.21% that she led for eight years.  She is being replaced by Eric Jing, Ant\u2019s chief executive officer, who is taking on the additional chairman role with immediate effect, Ant said in a statement Monday. Mr. Jing, who is 45 years old, has been CEO since October 2016, when he took over the job from Ms. Peng.  Ant said Ms. Peng will focus on running Lazada Group, an operator of online retail marketplaces in Southeast Asia that Alibaba is using as a beachhead to expand in the region. Ant\u2019s statement said Lazada\u2019s growth is a key part of Alibaba\u2019s global strategy.  Ms. Peng, who is also one of Alibaba\u2019s co-founders, was named CEO of the Singapore-based company in March after Alibaba invested $2 billion in Lazada, adding to an earlier multibillion-dollar investment. She is also chairman of the company, in which Alibaba took a controlling stake in 2016.  Ant\u2019s management change comes as the company is raising as much as $5 billion from private investors, according to people familiar with the matter. The effort is widely seen as a prelude to an initial public offering of Ant, though there is no certainty the company will proceed with a listing in the near term. A spokesman for Ant declined to comment.  Hangzhou-based Ant\u2019s last announced fundraising round was in April 2016, when the company secured $4.5 billion from Chinese investors and earned a valuation of around $60 billion. Since then, the company has increased revenue, expanded its giant Alipay mobile-payments network, entered new markets and widened its scope of financial services for individuals and small businesses. It also has an asset-management business that oversees the world\u2019s largest money-market fund.  Ant\u2019s current fundraising effort includes local and foreign investors, who have subscribed to at least $3 billion of its shares, a person familiar with the matter said. Some market participants expect the latest share sale to give Ant a valuation of close to $100 billion.  Ms. Peng, who is famously media shy, has been a confidante of billionaire founder Jack Ma. She ran Alipay from 2010 to 2014, a period that spanned the business getting carved out from Alibaba and its rebranding as Ant. She went on to lead Ant as its CEO until 2016. Ms. Peng also became a billionaire after Alibaba\u2019s 2014 initial public offering.  \u201cShe definitely doesn\u2019t seek the limelight, but she gets on with it,\u201d said Duncan Clark, a former investment banker and chairman of tech consultancy BDA China, who wrote a book on Alibaba. Mr. Clark recalled that when some Ant staff pushed for transport and other perks similar to those provided by Western tech giants such as Apple or Google, Ms. Peng rebuffed them, telling her staff to focus on working hard. \u201cShe was very matter of fact,\u201d he added.  Before working at Ant, Ms. Peng held a longtime role as Alibaba\u2019s chief human-resources executive. She played an integral role in establishing Ant\u2019s corporate culture and overseeing the expansion of Alipay, which is used by more than 520 million people to pay for everything including groceries, movie tickets and utility bills.  Mr. Ma, in an internal email Monday, said that when Ms. Peng took the post of executive chairman of Lazada, \u201cLucy told me the time had come for Eric to take on even more responsibility and for her to step away and give Ant\u2019s leadership team the space to grow even faster.\u201d  Mr. Jing previously held other positions within Ant and Alipay, including chief operating officer, president and chief financial officer. He joined Alibaba in 2007 as a finance executive and started working at Alipay two years later.  Mr. Jing on Monday called Ms. Peng a mentor and said she was \u201cinstrumental in cultivating a world-class Ant Financial team\u201d that will stay true to its mission, according to Ant\u2019s statement.  Alibaba said in February that it would acquire about a one-third stake in Ant and end a profit-sharing agreement with the affiliate. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of this year.

In a U.S. regulatory filing, Baidu said it would list iQiyi on the Nasdaq exchange and is seeking to raise around $1.5 billion. Analysts at Jefferies have valued iQiyi at $17 billion.  The move comes as Baidu looks to raise money for the loss-making unit to stay ahead in the fiercely competitive video-streaming sector where tech titans Tencent Holdings Ltd.

But a tough competitive environment and the costs of providing content have made streaming a money-losing proposition for Baidu, as well as for its internet rivals Tencent and Alibaba.  \u201cWe incurred net losses since our inception,\u201d iQiyi said in its filing, including losses of 3.7 billion yuan in 2017.  Junwen Woo, a senior analyst at IHS Markit who tracks online video in Asia, said iQiyi has potential because of its use of AI, which helps the company differentiate from competing Chinese video platforms operated by much bigger rivals Alibaba and Tencent.  \u201cThey can know what is the most popular content and what are the most favorite things viewers like\u2014and what is coming up next,\u201d she said.  In fundraising last year, iQiyi raised $1.53 billion, an investment that came months after investors balked at a $2.3 billion buyout bid from a group led by Baidu Chief Executive Robin Li, saying the proposal undervalued the unit.

Beijing would like to see more Chinese companies choose the mainland capital market as their primary listing destination eventually, the investment bankers said.  \u201cAt some point, it makes sense for Alibaba and Tencent to have their primary listings in China,\u201d said Paul Gillis, an accounting professor at Peking University\u2019s Guanghua School of Management. \u201cThe government has a long-term plan to wean these companies off the U.S.\u201d  \u201cThis would be a step in that direction,\u201d he said.  Tencent and Alibaba are already among the world\u2019s most valuable companies, and China has earmarked frontier technologies such as artificial intelligence as important growth drivers for the country\u2019s economy.  Shares in Hong Kong-listed Tencent\u2014the owner of China\u2019s most popular messaging app, WeChat\u2014more than doubled last year. In the process Tencent became the first Chinese technology company to crack the $500 billion valuation club, joining industry titans such as Facebook Inc. and Apple Inc.  NYSE-listed shares of Alibaba, China\u2019s largest e-commerce company, almost doubled last year. Alibaba now has a market capitalization of more than $460 billion.  In recent days, a number of tech companies said they are open to a China listing, though executives haven\u2019t gone into details. Tencent Chief Executive Pony Ma said the company would \u201cactively consider\u201d listing inside China. Baidu Inc. Chairman Robin Li said recently that the search-engine company has \u201calways wanted to come home to China.\u201d Richard Liu, chairman of Nasdaq-listed e-commerce company JD.com Inc., said \u201cif the authorities allow it, we are willing.\u201d The executives were speaking on the sidelines of China\u2019s annual legislative meetings, currently taking place in Beijing.  Chinese technology firms have in the past often opted for overseas listings, many in the U.S., for the prestige and to benefit from rules allowing dual-class share structures that give company owners more control over the business. The Chinese regulator\u2019s tough listing rules, such as the requirement for companies to be profitable for three years before listing, have also deterred high-growth technology firms from seeking direct share sales at home.  The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month that Chinese regulators have already approached smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp., which has plans to go public in Hong Kong. Investors say it would be sensible for China\u2019s technology companies to list at home, given the brand awareness they command there and the likelihood their shares would trade at high valuations.  Still, analysts have some concerns. Depending on how contracts are drawn up, Chinese individual investors buying depository receipts could lack full shareholder rights, they say. The listings of a few hot names could also fuel speculation by Chinese individual investors, who dominate trading on the mainland.  \u201cWhen the government is supporting something, everyone rushes in,\u201d said T.J. Wong, a professor of business administration and accounting at the University of Southern California\u2019s Marshall School of Business. \u201cWhat you don\u2019t want is a huge bubble, then a burst.\u201d  Chinese companies often have to wait years before getting approval from the market regulator to list their shares. The authorities would likely expedite this process for some tech firms, the investment bankers said.  Letting a number of top-quality companies issue shares on the mainland could help the Chinese market mature, analysts said. Beijing\u2019s goal, said one foreign banker, is to \u201ctake the winners.\u201d  It isn\u2019t clear when the regulator would formally invite specific companies into its market, given that changes to Chinese securities law would need high-level leadership approval.  \u2014Yoko Kubota contributed to this article.

So last week, he picked up the car for a three-day test drive from a vending machine.  Mr. Zhou never visited a dealership or spoke to a salesperson. He booked the test drive online, then showed up at a service center where employees can identify would-be buyers using facial-recognition technology. His SUV was then delivered from the eight-story \u201cvending machine\u201d\u2014essentially an automated parking garage.  \u201cThis is so much more efficient and convenient than traditional dealerships,\u201d said Mr. Zhou, 38 years old.  It\u2019s the first of several such car-vending centers that Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. plans to open across China this year\u2014part of the company\u2019s latest effort to translate its success in online retailing to the physical shopping world.  Alibaba is betting on the experiment to succeed in China, where consumers have enthusiastically embraced the e-commerce economy. Mr. Zhou buys clothes, home appliances and even the construction materials needed for his recent home renovation without going into a traditional store.  At Alibaba\u2019s auto vending center, a man requests delivery of a car. The center stands some 5 stories tall and contains more than 40 Ford vehicles. Photo: aleksandar plavecski/epa-efe/rex/EPA/Shutterstock  The car-vending concept has been tried in the U.S.\u2014with limited success. Carvana, a used-car dealer in Phoenix, has been operating such structures since 2013. Customers can search for, purchase, finance and trade-in vehicles online, then have the option of picking it up from a giant vending machine filled with cars.  But the model hasn\u2019t taken off more broadly in the U.S., where many consumers prefer to negotiate a deal in person, and have the salesperson help them with tasks such as pairing their smartphone with a car\u2019s Bluetooth, said David Sullivan, a Michigan-based analyst with AutoPacific Inc.  China\u2019s automotive retail climate is different\u2014and ripe for disruption, analysts say.  China\u2019s consumers, often first-time car buyers, are more open to trying out new concepts, said Dean Stoneley, Ford\u2019s Asia Pacific vice president for marketing. Ford has seen sales in China decline sharply in recent months as domestic competitors become more popular. Ford is now searching for new ways to engage customers, as more and more go online to do their car-buying research, Mr. Stoneley said.  \u201cA car vending machine is the ultimate word in frictionless commerce\u2014you don\u2019t have to deal with salespeople trying to talk you into things you don\u2019t want, and you don\u2019t have to haggle over price,\u201d said Jessica Wolfe, a principal in the Consumer and Retail practice of A.T. Kearney, a consulting firm. \u201cYou can think for yourself, do the research, and make the purchase when you\u2019re ready on your phone. That\u2019s exactly how millennials like to transact.\u201d  At the vending center, attendants are available to explain a car\u2019s basic features and to answer questions. Ford said each car has contact details of local dealerships where customers can go with questions or problems.  China\u2019s internet giants are experimenting with bringing the principles of e-commerce into other corners of the physical retail world as well. Just as Amazon.com Inc. is experimenting with unmanned supermarkets, Chinese e-commerce companies are taking stakes in malls and supermarkets, digitizing such operations as they seek growth beyond their core online retail business. In some cases, they\u2019re aiming to use the vast troves of data they have gleaned from e-commerce to change the way consumers shop in the real world.  Alibaba is experimenting with using augmented reality mirrors and vending machines in malls to allow consumers to \u201cvirtually\u201d try on various lipstick colors and buy them on the spot through Alibaba\u2019s online platforms.  JD.com Inc., which made its name in online ordering and delivery, is also getting into brick and mortar with a chain of clerkless convenience stores where shoppers can pay using facial-recognition technology.  Under the auto vending-machine program rolled out by Alibaba last week, customers go to Alibaba\u2019s Tmall website to book the test drive, which is free for those with high scores on the Sesame Credit rating system by Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial Services Group. Without a high credit score, consumers have to fork out 99 yuan ($16) to test-drive selected Ford sedans and 198 yuan for other models including a Ford Mustang sports car.  Alibaba is currently offering only Ford models, but it is in talks with other foreign and domestic brands to expand the inventory, said Lu Huan, the marketing director for Tmall\u2019s automotive division.  China is the world's largest market for electric vehicles, thanks largely to subsidies that drive costs down. Those incentives will end by 2020, but the government is betting that won't be the end of the road for its electric dream. Photo/Video: Eva Tam/The Wall Street \u200bJournal\u200b  The vending machine in Guangzhou saw brisk business on its first day of operation. In the first two days, Ford received 450 orders to test-drive the vehicle, Mr. Stoneley said. Ford declined to say if the new approach has resulted in any sales yet.  The vending machine helps to ease anxiety for potential car buyers, who are often tense when they enter a dealership expecting a hard sell, said James Chao, a Shanghai-based automotive consultant at IHS Markit.  Still, Mr. Chao said car brands face a challenge with this approach: Without a salesman, it may be tougher to convert a test drive to an actual sale, or to respond to customer feedback in the process.  \u201cWith extended test drives you don\u2019t have someone seated next to you, listening to your feedback and trying to overcome your objections,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons that the auto retail process has stayed the same in the last 30 years.\u201d  Write to Liza Lin at Liza.Lin@wsj.com", "stock": "BABA"}, {"url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-19/netflix-no-longer-top-gun-in-s-p-500-this-year-nudged-by-nektar", "label": 0, "source": "bloomberg", "date": "2018-03-19", "article": "Netflix Is No Longer the Top Gun in S&P 500 This Year  Netflix has been dethroned by Nektar Therapeutics as the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 this year.

Netflix came in slightly above Wall Street expectations on revenue, and in-line with estimates on EPS.

Netflix is accessible through Altice One, which is Altice's device that allows users to access streaming services like YouTube and Pandora. Netflix is partnering with an increasing number of cable providers, and is also integrated into Comcast's Xfinity X1 set-top box.  Under the partnership, Altice customers who aren't already subscribed to Netflix can do so directly through Altice One. Altice USA is one of the US' largest broadband communications and video service providers, with 3.4 million residential pay-TV customers as of Q3 2017. For context, Comcast reported 21.3 million residential video customers for FY 2017.  The Netflix-Altice partnership represents Netflix's ambition to grow through bundling with TV and internet providers. In Q2 2017, Netflix partnered with telecom SFR Group, a France-based subsidiary of Altice, to be sold with SFR's internet and TV services, for example. Bundling with TV and internet providers is mutually beneficial \u2014 Netflix can increase its reach in new markets, while its partners are able to upsell existing customers to more expensive packages.  Bundling with cable operators allows Netflix to capitalize on consumers who view linear TV and OTT services as complementary. A September 2017 study found that 49% of consumers who had their pay-TV service for four years or more subscribe to an OTT service, per TiVo. Even with the broader trend of consumers relying less on linear TV in favor of cheaper digital alternatives, Netflix can grow through set-top box partnerships by capturing long-term pay-TV subscribers who use OTT services in addition to pay-TV.

Netflix's next 100 million subscribers will come from India, said Netflix CEO Reed Hastings at The Economic Times Global Business Summit (GBS) on Friday, per The Economic Times. For context, Netflix last reported 117.6 million global subscribers in Q4 2017.  The company didn't disclose how many India-based subscribers it had, but Consultancy Media Partners Asia estimates this figure at more than 500,000. To help grow its subscriber base in India, the company plans to release five to six Indian originals a year, and it announced on Friday three new Indian original series it's commissioning.  India is an attractive market for Netflix for several reasons:  Consumer spending in India is anticipated to more than double by 2025. Rising household income and economic growth are expected to boost consumer spending in the country to $4 trillion by 2025. Growth in consumer spending implies that the pool of consumers who can sign up for a Netflix subscription will increase significantly in the coming years.

Internet penetration has grown rapidly and will nearly double by 2021. Internet penetration in India has grown nearly sevenfold since 2009, per Kleiner Perkins.

Internet penetration in India has grown nearly sevenfold since 2009, per Kleiner Perkins. Meanwhile, Cisco predicts the number of internet users in India will rise from 373 million in 2016 to 829 million in 2021. And Indian consumers are increasingly viewing long-form online video. Online video consumption in India grew by five times in 2017, with videos longer than 20 minutes accounting for 96% of content viewed on Hotstar, India's largest video streaming service, per WARC. This bodes well for Netflix, which tends to focus on releasing longer-form original series over short-form original content.  However, Netflix's pricing strategy may cause Indian consumers to turn to more affordable streaming services. A Netflix subscription in India costs around $7-12 per month, depending on the package, versus $3 per month for Hotstar and $15 per year for Amazon Prime, which includes access to Prime Video. Hastings said Netflix hopes Indian consumers compare Netflix's price to movie tickets, rather than a typical pay-TV subscription, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Although Indian consumers will gain more disposable income in the coming years, the amount they're willing spend on OTT services will remain limited, which may inhibit Netflix's ability to onboard subscribers in the region.

This time, you have Lydia and Schneider (Todd Grinnell) going through the citizenship process. Was that something you wanted to keep exploring?  In my family, not all of the Cubans became citizens. My parents became citizens, but I have aunts and uncles who did not. When you become a U.S. citizen, you have to renounce your Cuban citizenship. They\u2019re green card holders \u2014 they pay taxes, social security and they can\u2019t vote. When Trump started deporting people, my cousins got really concerned. \u201cShould we have mom become a citizen?\u201d There was all this worry. What if Lydia had never become a citizen? Then it would be fun to have her and Schneider go on that journey together.  Another story line you kept exploring this season was Penelope\u2019s depression, and how she\u2019s still struggling with the social stigma and the need to rely on antidepressants to help her.  We really wanted to get that right. It also seemed like something veterans really struggle with; Latinos have a lot of issues with discussing it or going on medications. We wanted to explore what that was like for this character. Also, she\u2019s at a great point in her life, so it\u2019s that placebo of \u201cEverything is going great, and I don\u2019t need to do any of this stuff anymore.\u201d Then, we saw what the reality of that looked like for her. She couldn\u2019t talk to her mom about it, and she couldn\u2019t talk to her boyfriend about it because she was embarrassed. It was also a way to deepen her relationship with Schneider because he was the only person she could talk to about it.  Is there a story you\u2019re looking forward to continuing in Season 3?  Well, we have a few things built in already. Penelope is in school, so she still will be in school, or maybe graduate. We get to see her journey to being a nurse practitioner. Seeing what else is out there for her dating life as well. Deepening Elena\u2019s relationship. Maybe Alex will get to have a little love in his life. And of course, we\u2019ll be taking into consideration what's happening in the next month or two months from now.

Photo  Ted Sarandos, the chief content officer at Netflix, laid down the gauntlet five years ago when he said, \u201cThe goal is to become HBO faster than HBO can become us.\u201d  That statement seemed unlikely, coming from an executive who had only recently begun overseeing original programming at a company better known for tucking DVDs into postage-paid red envelopes.  Jump-cut to the present: Netflix is valued at some $115 billion and has 110.6 million subscribers worldwide. It has shown off its might by signing David Letterman to a deal at reportedly $2 million an episode for his new talk show series, giving Chris Rock a reported $40 million for two standup specials and handing Jerry Seinfeld a reported $100 million for his interview program, \u201cComedians in Cars Drinking Coffee,\u201d and standup shows.  Dana Walden, a co-chief executive of the Fox television group, said Mr. Sarandos\u2019s signing of Ms. Rhimes was the deal that had evinced a deep change in Hollywood.  \u201cWhat Ted did was extremely disruptive and sent a message to the entire talent community: These old deals that seemed incredibly lucrative at the time, there\u2019s a new template in town,\u201d Ms. Walden said. \u201cFor any uber-premium creator, the value has gone up 10 times. And Ryan is a once-in-a-lifetime creator.\u201d  Rick Rosen, the head of TV at the agency WME, said it had become clear that Netflix was now able to outspend the companies that had been around since the early days of the movie business.

While that is no match for Netflix, the company has seen growth in each of the last two quarters.  Apple is the wild card.

With the old Hollywood model disrupted, or perhaps broken, Disney, Fox, CBS, Viacom and Time Warner have moved to gain scale in their efforts to compete against the deep-pocketed upstarts.  Pending governmental approval, Disney will acquire much of 21st Century Fox in a $52.4 billion deal that the two companies reached in December. CBS and Viacom, which were part of the same corporation from 2000 to 2006, are in talks to reunite. And AT&T is working to purchase Time Warner \u2014 a deal that is in jeopardy because of a lawsuit filed by the Justice Department to block it on antitrust grounds.  The mergers and acquisitions taking place in the background are, for now, a destabilizing force in the entertainment industry \u2014 one that likely contributed to Mr. Murphy\u2019s decision to leave old Hollywood for the streaming space.  Photo  \u201cWere the Disney deal to have never happened, I think he would have been close to a new deal with us,\u201d said Ms. Walden, the Fox executive who has worked closely with Mr. Murphy. \u201cIf the Disney move happened a year ago, and the transaction was completed by now and we were part of the Disney Company, I think he would be part of us.\u201d  Mr. Murphy declined to comment for this article.  Disney \u2014 a part-owner of Hulu that is building new streaming services under its chief executive, Robert A. Iger \u2014 has repeatedly cited 21st Century Fox\u2019s ability to create popular programming as one of the main reasons it sought to acquire it from Rupert Murdoch. Disney\u2019s own television studio has not been a reliable supplier.  The day after losing Mr. Murphy to Netflix, John Landgraf, the chief executive of FX, which is part of 21st Century Fox, pointed to his cable network\u2019s long record of producing talent, including Donald Glover (\u201cAtlanta\u201d) and Pamela Adlon (\u201cBetter Things\u201d).  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  \u201cWith more than 20 scripted original series on our schedule or upcoming, FX has a very successful track record of identifying and developing talented writers who have produced award-winning hit shows, and it will continue to do so,\u201d he said.  The money aside, Mr. Murphy may have decided that he had a better chance of creating new shows with minimal interference from above at Netflix, rather than at a Disneyfied version of 21st Century Fox. Referring to Disney\u2019s agreement to acquire much of the company at a news media event last month, the producer said: \u201cWhen this deal first went down, I got a call from the Murdochs and I got a call from Mr. Iger. And I said point-blank, you know, the stuff that I do is not specifically Disney, and I\u2019m interested in that and I\u2019m concerned about that.\u201d  The Murphy deal is a distillation of what may prove to be a once-in-a-generation Hollywood moment. He was looking for security at a time when the old-line companies had yet to take the expanded form they are likely to assume in the next year \u2014 and when the streaming services are spending in manic style.  And it helps that Mr. Murphy has become a Netflix obsessive in his own right.  \u201cAll Ryan has watched for the last year has been Netflix,\u201d said Ms. Walden, who is the godmother to Mr. Murphy\u2019s children. \u201cHe loves their Y.A. series, he loves their documentaries, he watched \u2018The OA\u2019 and loved it, he loved \u201813 Reasons Why,\u2019 he admires the brand, the programming. It was the right timing and right company for him.\u201d  The question now is: How long will the streaming companies continue to spend in a George Streinbrenner-like fashion for talent? Last month, Netflix told investors that it had generated a net income of more than $559 million in 2017, but said its free cash flow was negative $2 billion \u2014 a figure that could balloon to $4 billion this year, the company said.", "stock": "NFLX"}, {"url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/netflix-signs-up-with-osn", "label": 1, "source": "techradar", "date": "2018-02-19", "article": "Very soon OSN customers will be able to access Netflix\u2019s content library via a new OSN Box that will be launched towards the end of the second quarter.

Also, local companies like Icflix, Starz Plus and OSN's own Wavo have better recognition -- this agreement gets Netflix's foot in the door.  The bigger challenge is actually producing shows that people in the area would like to watch.

The streaming service reported earnings per share of 41 cents, up from 15 cents a year ago, and revenue of $3.29 billion, slightly beating analysts\u2019 estimates of $3.28 billion. Most impressively, it added 8.3 million subscribers globally\u2014the highest in the company\u2019s history\u2014even as it raised its subscription price to $11 a month.

Legacy media, says Rich Greenfield of BTIG Research, should \u201cbe afraid, be very afraid.\u201d With hit content like \u201cStranger Things\u201d and \u201cThe Crown,\u201d Netflix has created a virtuous cycle: Subscribers keep joining at higher price points, allowing the company to spend more on content, which in turn allows them to draw in and retain more subscribers.  Of the over 8 million new subscribers, 6.36 million came from international markets. They have finally made Netflix\u2019s global segments profitable, delivering earnings of $227 million in 2017.  With an eye on competition, the company is accelerating its investments for 2018. It will raise marketing spending to $2 billion and spend $7.5 billion to $8 billion on new content, including 30 international original series in places like Poland, India, and Japan.  \u201cThis is a land grab opportunity,\u201d says Mr. Greenfield. \u201cThey see Disney , Apple , Amazon coming, and they\u2019re trying to extend their lead as far as possible before the competition gets going.\u201d  Netflix is slated to have a long lead indeed.

The company added 8.3 million streaming users\u2014the most it has ever gained in a quarter\u2014exceeding the 6.3 million net additions it had projected. The growth in the U.S. and internationally brought its total paid subscriber count to 110.6 million at the end of the fourth quarter.

And Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings said on the company\u2019s earnings call that content costs will continue to rise in 2019 and 2020.  Netflix said it now has $17.7 billion in streaming-content obligations, a measure of current and future costs for content acquisition, licensing and production.  In a rare move, the company took a $39 million noncash charge in the fourth quarter on content it decided not to release, which Chief Financial Officer David Wells said was \u201crelated to the societal reset around sexual harassment.\u201d Last year, Netflix cut ties with actor Kevin Spacey after he was accused of sexual harassment, and the streaming service said it would bring the hit drama \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d back for one final season without Mr. Spacey.

But the company said Monday that rising operating profits and slowing growth in original content spending will eventually lead to positive free cash flow.  \u201cThey are spending more on content and burning more cash,\u201d Anthony DiClemente, internet analyst at Evercore ISI, said. \u201cHowever, as long as the revenue growth is accelerating and the net subscriber additions continue, investors will look past the spending.\u201d  Netflix shares set a record closing price on Monday at $227.58, about 227 times earnings.  The company added 6.36 million foreign subscribers in the quarter, compared with its forecast of 5.05 million. It added 1.98 million U.S. subscribers, compared with its outlook for 1.25 million.  Netflix expects the growth to continue in the current quarter, projecting net additions of 1.45 million U.S. subscribers and 4.9 million international customers.  Netflix has increased its international investments in recent years. More than half of its total subscribers are from countries outside the U.S. and it plans over 30 international-focused original series this year, including in France, Poland, India and Korea. Monday, the company said the international segment contributed positively to the company\u2019s full-year profit for the first time.  Netflix said revenue increased 33% to $3.29 billion in its fourth quarter, above analysts\u2019 estimates.  Net income came in at $185.5 million, or 41 cents a share, compared with $66.7 million, or 15 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter.

The listings will appear under sponsored shopping results and will not affect regular search results on Google, the company said.  Google\u2019s pitch to retailers is a better chance to influence shoppers\u2019 purchasing decisions, a move that is likely to help them compete with rival Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O). Google hopes the program helps retailers capture more purchases on desktop, cell phones and smart home devices with voice search \u2013 the next frontier for e-commerce.  The previously unreported initiative sprang from Google\u2019s observation that tens of millions of consumers were sending image searches of products, asking \u201cWhere can I buy this?\u201d \u201cWhere can I find it?\u201d \u201cHow can I buy it?\u201d \u201cHow do I transact?\u201d Daniel Alegre, Google\u2019s president for retail and shopping, told Reuters exclusively.  Over the past two years, mobile searches asking where to buy products soared by 85 percent, Alegre said.  But the current default choice for many consumers is a Google search that ends with an Amazon purchase, analysts said. The new Google program, Shopping Actions, will be available in the United States to retailers of all sizes and could help retail chains keep those customers.  \u201cWe have taken a fundamentally different approach from the likes of Amazon because we see ourselves as an enabler of retail,\u201d Alegre said. \u201cWe see ourselves as part of a solution for retailers to be able to drive better transactions ... and get closer to the consumer.\u201d For consumers faced with a surfeit of choices, the idea is to make online buying easier by giving them a single shopping cart and instant checkout \u2013 a core feature of Amazon\u2019s retail dominance.  Retail chains can also offer products through the Google Home voice shopping device, holding on to those who may be headed to Amazon for better deals and giving them personalized recommendations based on previous purchase history.

REUTERS/Sergio Perez  For example, a shopper looking for sneakers on Google on his phone can see a retailer\u2019s listing and add that to his Google Express cart. Later, the customer can stand in the kitchen, and use the Google Home voice device to add paper towels to the same cart and buy everything at once.  Retail partners saw the average size of a customer\u2019s shopping basket increase by 30 percent, Alegre said, pointing to early results from the Shopping Actions program.  Ulta Beauty\u2019s average order value has jumped 35 percent since partnering with Google, Chief Executive Officer Mary Dillon said. Ulta sells makeup and skin care products from brands such as MAC, Estee Lauder (EL.N) and Clinique.  Over the past six months, Target said the number of items in shoppers\u2019 Google Express baskets have increased by nearly 20 percent, on average, as a result of its tie-up with the internet company.  ENEMY OF MY ENEMY IS MY FRIEND  The retailers are also eager to get in on the rapidly growing voice shopping market dominated by Amazon\u2019s popular Echo home device, analysts and consultants said.  Both Walmart and Target last year struck deals to appear in search results via Google Home.  Smart voice devices like Amazon Echo and Google Home will be installed in 55 percent of U.S. households by 2022, according to Juniper Research. Amazon\u2019s Alexa platform could generate $10 billion in revenues by 2020, a separate report from RBC Capital Markets estimated.  \u201cBrands are looking at Google as the enemy of the enemy and that makes Google their friend,\u201d said Guru Hariharan, CEO of retail technology firm Boomerang Commerce, referring to the competition between Amazon and chains like Walmart and Target.  Target shoppers \u201clove the ease and convenience of making their Target run without lifting a finger by using a voice interface,\u201d Chief Information and Digital Officer Mike McNamara said.  \u201cThis is just the beginning for Target and Google,\u201d he added. Target shoppers will soon be able to link their online account and loyalty card with their Google accounts and get 5 percent off on purchases and free shipping, McNamara said.", "stock": "GOOGL"}, {"url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/alphabet-gmail/google-to-debut-emails-that-automatically-update-idUSL2N1Q217R", "label": 1, "source": "reuters", "date": "2018-02-13", "article": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Gmail is about to get dynamic.

AMP is a set of programming intended to make webpages load faster by stripping out layers of technology.  It has drawn praise from publishers such as Hearst Corp and the Washington Post for making their websites more inviting for users. But some web developers have expressed concern that Google is getting too much say in how the web operates.  Google is pushing forward. The Gmail integration marks the first broader use for AMP. Other email providers can adopt AMP as well, Google announced as it kicks off an AMP-focused conference for software developers in Amsterdam.  The initial version of AMP for email is aimed at bulk senders.

Brian Wieser, a Pivotal Research analyst who reviewed Nielsen digital consumption data, said Google properties, including YouTube and Waze, combined to account for 27.4 percent of all time spent on digital media -- up 3 percentage points from the previous year. By contrast, Facebook\u2019s share of time spent fell about 2 points to 16.3 percent over the same period.  Facebook depends on people coming back frequently so it can collect data and use it to target ads at them. The company said in the fourth quarter that people were spending less time on the site after Facebook began shifting users\u2019 news feeds back toward posts from friends and family and away from businesses and media outlets. But if the trend continues, investors could take it as a sign that users are losing interest in Facebook.  Nielsen published its Digital Content Ratings on Tuesday. YouTube accounts for half of all Google activity and continues to draw consumption well in excess of 20 percent year-over-year every month, Weiser said. Other Google properties expanded by 33 percent.  Facebook\u2019s main site lost 5 percent in time spent, despite a 4 percent increase in the number of users. That amounts to an 8 percent decline per person, Weiser said. Instagram, a Facebook property, did much better with a 7 percent increase in time per user.  Analysts are closely watching the social network\u2019s user engagement amid revelations last month that the private data of millions of people was scooped up by the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica.

Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos Can\u2019t Beat Washington, So He\u2019s Joining It: The Influence Game  In the final days of 2017, President Donald Trump attacked Amazon, tweeting that the U.S. Postal Service should charge the world's largest online retailer \"MUCH MORE!\" for delivering packages. It capped a year of criticism from Trump about Amazon's market power, impact on jobs and ties to the Washington Post, which Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos owns. While that Twitter barrage grabbed headlines, behind the scenes, the e-commerce giant was furiously expanding lobbying efforts that have quickly made it one of the most-influential companies in Washington, according to data compiled by Bloomberg News. In the past five years, Amazon increased lobbying spending by more than 400 percent, a rate of change that far exceeds rivals\u2019. It lobbied more government agencies than any other tech company, pressed its case on as many issues as Google, and outspent everyone in the industry except for the search giant, the data show. \"They quietly went from Chihuahua to Great Dane in just a few years,\" said Bruce Mehlman, a former top technology policy official under President George W. Bush.  Sources: Senate Office of Public Record, Bloomberg research  Amazon.com Inc. has good reasons to amplify its presence in Washington. Big tech's long honeymoon of public goodwill is over and the company feels the painful transition as much as competitors like Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Facebook Inc. Amazon is fighting to be seen as a job creator, not a job killer, and is often blamed when traditional retail outlets close. \"They are getting smacked right and left with questions about whether they are undermining sectors, harming local business opportunities, actually undercutting innovation, destroying jobs and harming democracy,\" said Gene Kimmelman, president of the policy group Public Knowledge. To counter that impression, Amazon is making both public and private moves. In public, Bezos meets with lawmakers and attended President Trump's awkward summit with technology CEOs at Trump Tower in late 2016. Before Trump\u2019s inauguration, the Amazon founder also pledged to hire 100,000 workers over the next 18 months, paying homage to Trump's push to get companies to employ more Americans. Gone is the feisty combativeness on display during the presidential election, when Bezos offered on Twitter to give candidate Trump a free ride off the planet with the hashtag #SendDonaldToSpace. Behind the scenes, Amazon has increased its lobbying of lawmakers and government agencies, which can keep a crackdown at bay. Last year, for example, for the first time in nearly two decades, Amazon lobbied the Justice Department, which has broad criminal and civil enforcement powers spanning antitrust, national security and corporate wrongdoing. What makes Amazon different from its tech brethren is the company\u2019s insatiable quest to sell everything from advertising to entertainment, groceries, computing power and soon, maybe even health care. That forces it to wrestle with a growing list of issues, including transportation, shipping, aviation, taxes, immigration and antitrust. Last year, it lobbied on 24 general issues (each of which could include dozens of laws or regulations), up from eight in 2012. Entities lobbied, such as the Senate and NASA, jumped from eight in 2012 to 39 in 2017. Microsoft Corp., which survived a prolonged antitrust case in the 1990s, lobbied on 18 issues and engaged with 29 government agencies last year. Amazon has fought for favorable rules regarding online sales taxes since 2000. But its rise as a Washington powerhouse really began amid a flurry of activity in 2013. That fall, Bezos acquired the Washington Post for $250 million from its longtime owners, the Graham family, and two months later, unveiled Prime Air, a nascent project to speed deliveries using drones. At the time, the Federal Aviation Administration required unmanned aircraft to be flown within the line of sight of operators. Amazon argued the rules were designed for hobbyists, not commercial operators.

Rather than give up, the company re-doubled its efforts to influence rule-making and policymakers. Amazon also set about expanding its physical presence in the capital. In 2014, the company traded its old Washington offices in a small townhouse near a highway exit with spotty Wi-Fi for a modern office building on the same street as lobbying powerhouses like the National Association of Realtors. The new digs, home to Amazon policy staff and other employees, have polished cement floors and an exhibit showcasing the company's growth from niche bookseller to titan of online commerce. From its comfortable new perch, Amazon rapidly expanded its lobbying efforts. It started lobbying the White House in 2014, according to federal disclosures, and has every year since. In 2015, it hired former Obama White House Press Secretary Jay Carney as senior vice president of corporate affairs. He now oversees the Washington policy office, which has almost doubled its number of registered lobbyists to 27 from two years ago. That roster does not include outside lobbyists like former Senator John Breaux, a Democrat, and his Republican partner, onetime Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott. \u201cAs one of the biggest job creators in the country, we\u2019ve expanded our team in Washington, D.C., to ensure we are able to cover the growing range of topics that are important to policymakers, our employees, and our customers,\u201d Brian Huseman, Amazon's vice president of public policy, said in a statement.  Amazon's lobbying spending grew the fastest Percent change in spending since 2012 Sources: Senate Office of Public Record, Bloomberg research  Winning friends in Washington has become a necessity for Amazon as it moves into more territory overseen by federal agencies. It's delivering groceries to food-stamp recipients in a trial run by the Agriculture Department. It handles hundreds of billions of dollars in transactions and lends money to small businesses selling goods on its site, requiring the company work with financial regulators. It lobbies for postal reform and infrastructure spending to get orders to customers more quickly. Amazon's cloud-computing business may have the most at stake. In 2013, it won a multi-year CIA contract, and is in the running for a decade-long Defense Department cloud contract potentially worth billions more. The Pentagon awarded a separate $950 million cloud contract to an Amazon affiliate earlier this month. The government seems pleased with these arrangements so far. The CIA's John Edwards delivered a 13-minute testimonial in June to thousands of people at an Amazon-sponsored event at Washington\u2019s convention center, saying partnering with Amazon Web Services is \u201cthe most innovative thing we\u2019ve ever done.\u201d In 2016, Bezos was appointed to the Defense Innovation Advisory Board, which aims to keep the Pentagon atop new technologies. He hosted Defense Secretary James Mattis at Amazon\u2019s Seattle headquarters in August, posting pictures of the visit on Twitter.

It has lobbied other federal agencies on issues related to cloud computing for at least six years, trying to change the way government buys and uses tech services. Amazon's most-recent effort focuses on music. It's supporting the Music Modernization Act, which would change the way artists and license holders get paid when people buy or stream digital music. Steve Boom, vice president of Amazon Music, worked the halls of Congress on the bill at the end of January. Amazon also hosted a meeting in a congressional office building where the sponsor of the legislation, Georgia Republican Representative Doug Collins, thanked the company for its months of work, a person familiar with the event said.

Most marketers already buy banner and video ads on websites based on impressions rather than cost-per-click. \"CPC is a meaningless number,\" he said.  The company also said that unrealized gains and losses on non-marketable equity securities, such as investments in private companies, will be reported as part of income. The tech giant has backed many large closely held companies including Uber Technologies Inc., Lyft Inc., and Magic Leap.  As a result, the company said it expects \"increased volatility\" on its income statement.  Finally, Alphabet said it will begin to report sales from Nest, its connected-home device division, under Google rather than its catch-all Other Bets segment. Nest moved to become part of Google\u2019s hardware business in February.  Alphabet described the changes, which kick in for the first quarter, in a statement on Monday.

Google is aiming to make its Google Assistant voice platform more useful by enabling multi-step voice commands and more tightly integrating the assistant with smartphones and carriers, according to The Verge.  The forthcoming updates are aimed at giving developers, phone vendors, and wireless carriers the tools to create a more interactive user experience, reach more users, and create a more seamless voice assistant experience. These updates are expected to roll out in the coming weeks and throughout the year.  Here are some of the new tools and expanded features that Google is hoping will win over more consumers and voice developers:  Routine commands on the Google Home smart speaker. Smart home routines enable users to manage their connected devices with just a single voice command to Google Assistant. Saying \"Good morning\" to Google Assistant can simultaneously turn on the lights, increase the thermostat temperature, and begin outlining the user's day via Google Calendar, for example. The announcement comes on the heels of a similar offering from Amazon.  Google Assistant.

Expanded language support.Google Assistant will become available in over 30 languages by the end of the year, up from the eight languages it currently supports. This will enable Google Assistant to reach 95% of all active Android phones globally, according to Google VP of Product Nick Fox. Enabling Google Assistant to support more languages will help expand its global audience, and can spur usage of developers' apps.

This multilingual feature will initially only be available in English, French, and German, but is expected to expand to more languages over time. Deeper Assistant integration with phones and carriers. Google is working with smartphone vendors, starting with Xiaomi, LG, and Sony, to integrate Google Assistant with the specific hardware and software of smartphones. Users will be able to ask Google Assistant to launch a specific camera feature, issuing commands like, \"Hey Google, launch my camera's augmented reality mode,\" for example. Google is also working with wireless carriers, the first being Sprint, Vodafone, Telus, and Koodo, to integrate their services with Assistant. This could allow users to ask Google Assistant to check how much data is left on their monthly allotment, or even add more data to their plan.  The latest announcements could be key in helping Google bolster its voice assistant platform and spur adoption of the technology. A major challenge facing the overall voice assistant market is that most consumers rely on them to conduct simple tasks, like getting weather updates or setting timers, while complex and lengthy interactions lag. By creating new experiences that expand Google Assistant's ability to complete more complex tasks, the usefulness of the platform will increase, and engagement can grow as a result. As voice assistants become more intelligent, and developers create better and more useful ways to integrate them with consumers' lives, voice will cement itself as the primary way consumers interact with their devices.  Business Insider Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has written a detailed report on voice apps that explores the two major viable voice app stores. It identifies the three big issues voice apps are facing \u2014 discoverability, monetization, and retention \u2014 and presents possible short-term solutions ahead of industry-wide fixes.  Here are some of the key takeaways from the report:  The market for smart speakers and voice platforms is expanding rapidly. The installed base of smart speakers and the volume of voice apps that can be accessed on them each saw significant gains in 2017. But the new format and the emerging voice ecosystems that are making their way into smart speaker-equipped homes is so far failing to align with consumer needs.  Voice app development is a virtuous cycle with several broken components. The addressable consumer market is expanding, which is prompting more brands and developers to developer voice apps, but the ability to monetize and iterate those voice apps is limited, which could inhibit voice app growth.  Monetization is only one broken component of the voice app ecosystem. Discoverability and user retention are equally problematic for voice app development.  While the two major voice app ecosystems \u2014 Amazon's and Google's \u2014 have some Band-Aid solutions and workarounds, their options for improving monetization, discoverability, and retention for voice apps are currently limited.  There are some strategies that developers and brands can employ in the near term ahead of more robust tools and solutions.  In full, the report:  Sizes the current voice app ecosystem.

That\u2019s because with this update, Sheets users can now finally record macros. That\u2019s a feature that has long been part of virtually every other productivity suite but that was sorely missing in Google\u2019s G Suite.  The new \u201crecord macros\u201d feature, which sits in the Tools menu, does exactly what you think it should do. You simply start your recording, go through your usual steps and when you\u2019re done, all it takes to repeat all those steps is to run the macro again. Never again will you have to spend minutes on reformatting that same spreadsheet over and over again. Instead, you\u2019ll have more time to play with your puppy (or get more work done, if you\u2019re so inclined).  In the backend, Sheets actually converts your macro into Apps Script code, which also means that if you want to dive a bit deeper or make a small change, you can edit that script.  In addition to macro support, this Sheets update also brings a couple of other features, including the ability to add page breaks (for when you print a spreadsheet), custom paper sizes, new options for row and column grouping and the option to turn a cell into a checkbox.

Even setting aside the sweating philosophical toil of algorithmically sifting for some kind of universal truth, were Mountain View to truly live up to its own mission statement it would entail massive philanthropic investments in global Internet infrastructure coupled with Herculean language localization efforts.  After all \u2014 according to a Google search snippet \u2014 there are close to 7,000 languages globally\u2026  Which means every piece of Google-organized information should also really be translated ~7,000 times \u2014 to enable the sought for universal access. Or at least until its Pixel Buds actually live up to the universal Babel Fish claims.  We\u2019ll let Alphabet off also needing to invest in vast global educational programs to deliver universal worldwide literacy rates, being as they do also serve up video snippets and have engineered voice-based interfaces to disperse data orally, thereby expanding accessibility by not requiring users can read to use their products. (This makes snippets of increasing importance to Google\u2019s search biz, of course, if it\u2019s to successfully transition into the air, as voice interfaces that read you ten possible answers would get very tedious, very fast.)  Really, a more accurate Google mission statement would include the qualifier \u201csome of\u201d after the word \u201corganize\u201d. But hey, let\u2019s not knock Googlers for dreaming impossibly big.  And while the company might not yet be anywhere close to meaningfully achieving its moonshot mission, it has just announced some tweaks to those aforementioned search snippets \u2014 to try to avoid creating problematic information hierarchies.  As its search results unfortunately have been.  Thing is, when a search engine makes like an oracle of truth \u2014 by using algorithms to select and privilege a single answer per user generated question \u2014 then, well, bad things can happen.  Like your oracle informing the world that women are evil. Or claiming president Obama is planning a coup. Or making all sorts of other wild and spurious claims.  Here\u2019s a great thread to get you up to speed on some of the stupid stuff Google snippets have been suggestively passing off as \u2018universal truth\u2019 since they launched in January 2014\u2026  Google became the world\u2019s go-to source of information by ranking billions of links from millions of sources. Now it often presents a seemingly definitive answer above other search results \u2014 and many are contentious, improbable or laughably incorrect. https://t.co/ezepEiJAOT \u2014 Jack Nicas (@jacknicas) November 16, 2017  \u201cLast year, we took deserved criticism for featured snippets that said things like \u2018women are evil\u2019 or that former U.S. President Barack Obama was planning a coup,\u201d Google confesses now, saying it\u2019s \u201cworking hard\u201d to \u201csmooth out bumps\u201d with snippets as they \u201ccontinue to grow and evolve\u201d.  Bumps! We guess what they mean to say is algorithmically exacerbated bias and very visible instances of major and alarming product failure.  \u201cWe failed in these cases because we didn\u2019t weigh the authoritativeness of results strongly enough for such rare and fringe queries,\u201d Google adds.  For \u201crare and fringe queries\u201d you should also read: \u2018People deliberately trying to game the algorithm\u2019. Because that\u2019s what humans do (and frequently why algorithms fail and/or suck or both).  Sadly Google does not specify what proportion of search queries are rare and fringe, nor offer a more detailed breakdown of how it defines those concepts. Instead it claims:  The vast majority of featured snippets work well, as we can tell from usage stats and from what our search quality raters report to us, people paid to evaluate the quality of our results. A third-party test last year by Stone Temple found a 97.4 percent accuracy rate for featured snippets and related formats like Knowledge Graph information.  But even ~2.6% of featured snippets and related formats being inaccurate translates into a staggering amount of potential servings of fake news given the size of Google\u2019s search business. (A Google snippet tells me the company \u201cnow processes over 40,000 search queries every second on average\u2026 which translates to over 3.5 billion searches per day and 1.2 trillion searches per year worldwide\u201d.)  Google also flags the launch last April of updated search quality rater guidelines for IDing \u201clow-quality webpages\u201d \u2014 claiming this has helped it combat the problem of snippets serving wrong, stupid and/or biased answers.  \u201cThis work has helped our systems better identify when results are prone to low-quality content. If detected, we may opt not to show a featured snippet,\u201d it writes.  Though clearly, as Nicas\u2019 Twitter thread illustrates, Google still had plenty of work to do on the stupid snippet front as of last fall.  In his thread Nicas also noted that a striking facet of the problem for Google is the tendency for the answers it packages as \u2018truth snippets\u2019 to actually reflect how a question is framed \u2014 thereby \u201cconfirming user biases\u201d. Aka the filter bubble problem.  Google is now admitting as much, as it blogs about the reintroduced snippets, discussing how the answers it serves can end up contradicting each other depending on the query being asked.  \u201cThis happens because sometimes our systems favor content that\u2019s strongly aligned with what was asked,\u201d it writes. \u201cA page arguing that reptiles are good pets seems the best match for people who search about them being good. Similarly, a page arguing that reptiles are bad pets seems the best match for people who search about them being bad. We\u2019re exploring solutions to this challenge, including showing multiple responses.\u201d  So instead of a single universal truth, Google is flirting with multiple choice relativism as a possible engineering solution to make its suggestive oracle a better fit for messy (human) reality (and bias).  \u201cThere are often legitimate diverse perspectives offered by publishers, and we want to provide users visibility and access into those perspectives from multiple sources,\u201d writes Google, self-quoting its own engineer employee, Matthew Gray.  No shit Sherlock, as the kids used to say.  Gray leads the featured snippets team, and is thus presumably the techie tasked with finding a viable engineering workaround for humanity\u2019s myriad shades of grey. We feel for him, we really do.  Another snippets tweak Google says it\u2019s toying with \u2014 in this instance mostly to make itself look less dumb when its answers misfire in relation to the specific question being asked \u2014 is to make it clearer when it\u2019s showing only a near match for a query, not an exact match.  \u201cOur testing and experiments will guide what we ultimately do here,\u201d it writes cautiously. \u201cWe might not expand use of the format, if our testing finds people often inherently understand a near-match is being presented without the need for an explicit label.\u201d", "stock": "GOOGL"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/20/magazine/the-case-against-google.html", "label": 1, "source": "the-new-york-times", "date": "2018-02-20", "article": "For search engines like Google, finding that one correct answer becomes particularly difficult when people have numerous parameters they want satisfied: Which vacuum cleaner is cheapest but also energy-efficient and good on thick carpets and won\u2019t scare the dog? To balance those competing preferences, you need a great vertical-search engine, which was something Adam and Shivaun had thought a lot about.  Photo  Soon the Raffs began daydreaming about turning their idea into a moneymaker. They didn\u2019t have the funds to compete with huge dating sites like Match.com, so they applied for a couple of patents and began brainstorming. They believed that their vertical-search technology was good \u2014 better, in fact, than almost anything they had seen online. Best of all, it was built to work well on almost any kind of data set. With just a bit of tinkering, it could search for cheap airline tickets, or great apartments, or high-paying jobs. It could handle questions with hard-to-compare variables, like what\u2019s the cheapest flight between London and Las Vegas if I\u2019m trying to choose between business class or leaving after 3 p.m.?  As far as they could tell, their search technology performed better on such problems than Google did, which Adam discovered when he tried to buy an iPod online. \u201cI spent half an hour searching Google for the lowest price, and it drove me completely mad,\u201d he told me. It was impossible for him to figure out which sites were selling iPods and which were selling accessories, like headphones or charging cords. Or Google would show Adam one price, but then the actual price was completely different. Or there was an extra charge for shipping. It seemed to Adam his technology would do a much better job.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Google executives, had they known of Adam\u2019s frustrations, probably wouldn\u2019t have been surprised. For years, Google had been trying to build a tool for comparing online prices. \u201cThe idea was you should be able to input any item, and we\u2019d show you the best place to buy it,\u201d says Brian Larson, a technical lead for what was then named Froogle and today is called Google Shopping. Larson\u2019s team was small \u2014 just himself and one other programmer at first, and roughly a dozen people at its height \u2014 and Larson would regularly test how Froogle compared with other online price-comparison services. \u201cSometimes we were neck and neck; sometimes, not so much,\u201d Larson said. \u201cWe had a hundred million product listings, which was better than competitors.\u201d But they were often outperformed by sites like PriceGrabber.com, which had many more employees devoted to price comparisons.  Froogle\u2019s limitations tended to pop up particularly when users included too many search parameters. For a while, Larson had a specific test search that Froogle kept failing, something like \u201cwhite running shoes and cheap and free shipping.\u201d Inevitably, the first result would be a Christmas elf wearing running shoes that some guy was selling online. No matter how Google\u2019s engineers fiddled with their coding, they couldn\u2019t stop the elf from appearing as the top link. Eventually, a manager bought the elf so it wouldn\u2019t appear in the search results anymore. \u201cWe made elf T-shirts,\u201d Larson told me. \u201cIt became our mascot.\u201d  Adam and Shivaun\u2019s technology was good enough to tell the difference between an elf wearing running shoes and an actual pair of running shoes. It was good enough, in fact, to figure out which websites charged hidden shipping fees and which offered truly good deals. So the Raffs quit their jobs, hired a few programmers, spent months perfecting their technology and, in early 2006, unveiled Foundem.com, a vertical-search engine for finding cheap online prices, to a small group of friends and associates. Each time someone used Foundem to buy something, the Raffs would receive a small payment from the website making the sale. Adam and Shivaun weren\u2019t sure their company would succeed \u2014 there were already a couple of other big price-comparison search engines, like PriceGrabber, NexTag and, of course, Google itself \u2014 but they figured this was how the internet was supposed to work: Two people with a new idea can take on giants and, if their technology is good enough, grow into colossi themselves.  The Raffs knew they would have to rely on Google to find customers. For one thing, as evidenced by the name Foundem, they weren\u2019t marketing geniuses. (\u201cIt\u2019s like we found \u2019em for you, you know?\u201d Shivaun explained.) But early tests indicated that Foundem usually came up high in Google\u2019s search results whenever people submitted queries like \u201ccompare prices xr-1000 motorcycle helmets.\u201d Six months later, they opened Foundem to the world, and initial traffic was encouraging. \u201cSearch engines liked the site,\u201d Shivaun told me. \u201cThat\u2019s supposed to be the recipe for success.\u201d As long as their vertical-search technology was strong, the Raffs figured, Google would guide shoppers to their door.  Google has succeeded where Genghis Khan, communism and Esperanto all failed: It dominates the globe. Though estimates vary by region, the company now accounts for an estimated 87 percent of online searches worldwide. It processes trillions of queries each year, which works out to at least 5.5 billion a day, 63,000 a second. So odds are good that sometime in the last week, or last hour, or last 10 minutes, you\u2019ve used Google to answer a nagging question or to look up a minor fact, and barely paused to consider how near-magical it is that almost any bit of knowledge can be delivered to you faster than you can type the request. If you\u2019re old enough to remember the internet before 1998, when Google was founded, you\u2019ll recall what it was like when searching online involved AltaVista or Lycos and consistently delivered a healthy dose of spam or porn. (Pity the early web enthusiasts who innocently asked Jeeves about \u201camateurs\u201d or \u201csteel.\u201d)  In other words, it\u2019s very likely you love Google, or are at least fond of Google, or hardly think about Google, the same way you hardly think about water systems or traffic lights or any of the other things you rely on every day. Therefore you might have been surprised when headlines began appearing last year suggesting that Google and its fellow tech giants were threatening everything from our economy to democracy itself. Lawmakers have accused Google of creating an automated advertising system so vast and subtle that hardly anyone noticed when Russian saboteurs co-opted it in the last election. Critics say Facebook exploits our addictive impulses and silos us in ideological echo chambers. Amazon\u2019s reach is blamed for spurring a retail meltdown; Apple\u2019s economic impact is so profound it can cause market-wide gyrations. These controversies point to the growing anxiety that a small number of technology companies are now such powerful entities that they can destroy entire industries or social norms with just a few lines of computer code. Those four companies, plus Microsoft, make up America\u2019s largest sources of aggregated news, advertising, online shopping, digital entertainment and the tools of business and communication. They\u2019re also among the world\u2019s most valuable firms, with combined annual revenues of more than half a trillion dollars.  In a rare display of bipartisanship, lawmakers from both political parties have started questioning how these tech giants grew so powerful so fast. Regulators in Missouri, Utah, Washington, D.C., and elsewhere have called for greater scrutiny of Google and others, citing antitrust concerns; some critics have suggested that our courts and legislatures need to go after tech firms in the same way the trustbusters broke up oil and railroad monopolies a century ago. But others say that Google and its cohort are guilty only of delighting customers. If these tech leviathans ever fail to satisfy us, their defenders argue, capitalism will punish them the same way it once brought down Yahoo, AOL and Myspace.  At the core of this debate is a question that is more than a century old: When does a megacompany\u2019s behavior become so brazen that it violates the law? In the early 1900s, just after the Industrial Revolution, the federal government provided an answer by suing one of America\u2019s largest companies, Standard Oil, on the novel theory that big becomes bad when a giant uses its dominance not only to defeat its competitors but also to extinguish the possibility that competition might occur.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  In its technological innovation, Standard Oil was the Google of its day. The company\u2019s founder, John D. Rockefeller, had become the richest man in America by spending millions of dollars hiring scientists to transform how oil was refined and transported. And those innovations earned the public\u2019s admiration. In 1858, before Standard Oil was founded, lighting a home required whale oil, which cost up to $3 a gallon, putting illumination out of reach for all but the wealthiest of households. By 1885, after Standard Oil figured out how to refine kerosene, it cost just 8 cents a gallon to brighten the night. \u201cLet the good work go on,\u201d Rockefeller wrote to a partner. \u201cWe must ever remember we are refining oil for the poor man and he must have it cheap and good.\u201d  Standard Oil\u2019s technological discoveries gave the company huge advantages over its rivals, and Rockefeller exploited those advantages ruthlessly. He cut secret deals with railroads so that other firms had to pay more for transportation. He forced smaller refineries to choose between selling out to him or facing bankruptcy. \u201cRockefeller and his associates did not build the Standard Oil Co. in the boardrooms of Wall Street,\u201d wrote Ida Tarbell, a muckraking journalist of the day. \u201cThey fought their way to control by rebate and drawback, bribe and blackmail, espionage and price cutting, and perhaps more important, by ruthless, never slothful efficiency of organization.\u201d  In 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt ordered his Justice Department to sue Standard Oil for antitrust violations. But government lawyers faced a quandary: It wasn\u2019t illegal for Standard Oil to be a monopoly. It wasn\u2019t even illegal to compete mercilessly. So government prosecutors found a new argument: If a firm is more powerful than everyone else, they said, it can\u2019t simply act like everyone else. Instead, it has to live by a special set of rules, so that other companies get a fair shot. \u201cThe theory was that competition is good, and if a monopoly extinguishes competition, that\u2019s bad,\u201d says Herbert Hovenkamp, co-author of a seminal treatise on antitrust law. \u201cOnce you become a monopoly, you have to start acting differently, and if you don\u2019t, then what you\u2019ve been doing all along starts breaking the law.\u201d  The Supreme Court agreed and split Standard Oil into 34 firms. (Rockefeller received stock in all of them and became even wealthier.) In the decades following the Standard Oil breakup, antitrust enforcement generally abided by a core principle: When a company grows so powerful that it becomes a gatekeeper, and uses that might to undermine competitors, then the government should intervene. And in the last century, as courts have censured other monopolies, academics and jurists have noticed a pattern: Monopolies and technology often seem intertwined. When a company discovers a technological advantage \u2014 like the innovations of Rockefeller\u2019s scientists \u2014 it sometimes makes that firm so powerful that it becomes a monopoly almost without trying very hard. Many of the most important antitrust lawsuits in American history \u2014 against IBM, Alcoa, Kodak and others \u2014 were rooted in claims that one company had made technological discoveries that allowed it to outpace competitors.  For decades, there seemed to be a consensus among policymakers and business leaders (though not always among targeted companies) about how the antitrust laws should be enforced. But around the turn of this century, a number of tech companies emerged that caused some people to question whether the antitrust formula made sense anymore. Firms like Google and Facebook have become increasingly useful as they have grown bigger and bigger \u2014 a characteristic known as network effects. What\u2019s more, some have argued that the online world is so fast-moving that no antitrust lawsuit can keep pace. Nowadays even the biggest titan can be defeated by a tiny start-up, as long as the newcomer has better ideas or faster tech. Antitrust laws, digital executives said, aren\u2019t needed anymore.  Consider Microsoft. The government spent most of the 1990s suing Microsoft for antitrust violations, a prosecution that many now view as a complete waste of time and money. When Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, Bill Gates, signed a consent decree to resolve one of its monopoly investigations in 1994, he told a reporter that it was essentially pointless for the company\u2019s various divisions: \u201cNone of the people who run those divisions are going to change what they do or think.\u201d Even after a federal judge ordered Microsoft broken into separate companies in 2000, the punishment didn\u2019t take. Microsoft fought the ruling and won on appeal. The government then offered a settlement so feeble that nine states begged the court to reject the proposal. It was approved.  What eventually humbled Bill Gates and ended Microsoft\u2019s monopoly wasn\u2019t antitrust prosecutions, observers say, but a more nimble start-up named Google, a search engine designed by two Stanford Ph.D. dropouts that outperformed Microsoft\u2019s own forays into search (first MSN Search and now Bing). Then those two dropouts introduced a series of applications, like Google Docs and Google Sheets, that eventually began to compete with almost every aspect of Microsoft\u2019s businesses. And Google did all that not by relying on government prosecutors but by being smarter. You don\u2019t need antitrust in the digital marketplace, critics argue. \u201cWhen our products don\u2019t work or we make mistakes, it\u2019s easy for users to go elsewhere because our competition is only a click away,\u201d Google\u2019s co-founder, Larry Page, said in 2012. Translation: The government ought to stop worrying, because no online giant will ever survive any longer than it deserves to.  Once Foundem.com was available to everyone, the company\u2019s honeymoon lasted precisely two days. During its first 48 hours, the Raffs saw a rush of traffic from users typing product queries into Google and other search engines. But then, suddenly, the traffic stopped. Alarmed, Adam and Shivaun began running diagnostics. They quickly discovered that their site, which until then had been appearing near the top of search results, was now languishing on Google, mired 12 or 15 or 64 or 170 pages down. On other search engines, like MSN Search and Yahoo, Foundem still ranked high. But on Google, Foundem had effectively disappeared. And Google, of course, was where a vast majority of people searched online.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  The Raffs wondered if this could be some kind of technical error, so they began checking their coding and sending email to Google executives, begging them to fix whatever was causing Foundem to vanish. Figuring out whom to write, and how to contact them, was a challenge in itself. Although Google\u2019s parent company bills itself as a diversified firm with about 80,000 employees, almost 90 percent of the company\u2019s revenues derive from advertisements, like the ones that show up in search. As a result, there are few things more important to Google\u2019s executives than protecting the firm\u2019s search dominance, particularly among the most profitable kinds of queries, such as those of users looking to buy things online. In fact, at about the same time the Raffs were starting Foundem.com, Google executives were growing increasingly concerned about the threats that vertical-search engines posed to Google\u2019s business.  \u201cWhat is the real threat if we don\u2019t execute on verticals?\u201d one Google executive emailed his colleagues in 2005, according to internal documents later shared with the Federal Trade Commission. \u201cLoss of traffic from Google.com because folks search elsewhere for some queries,\u201d he wrote, in answer to his own question. \u201cIf one of our big competitors builds a constellation of high-quality verticals, we are hurt badly,\u201d the internal documents continued. Another executive put it more bluntly: \u201cGoogle\u2019s core business is monetizing commercial queries. If users go to competitors such as Amazon to do product queries, long-term revenue will suffer.\u201d  Google executives began holding battle-plan meetings for the vertical war. Shortly after Foundem.com went online, one executive issued an order: Henceforth, Google\u2019s own price-comparison results should appear at the top of many search pages, as quickly as possible, even if that meant disregarding the natural results of the company\u2019s search algorithm. \u201cLong term, I think we need to commit to a more aggressive path,\u201d a high-ranking Google employee wrote to colleagues. Eventually, a mandate came from the chief executive: \u201cLarry thought product should get more exposure,\u201d a senior official wrote.  One way to get that exposure was to influence the rules governing how Google displayed search results. In 2006, Google instituted a shift in its search algorithm, known as the Big Daddy update, which penalized websites with large numbers of subpages but few inbound links. A few years later, another shift, known as Panda, penalized sites that copied text from other websites. When adjustments like these occurred, Google explained to users, they were aimed at combating \u201cindividuals or systems seeking to \u2018game\u2019 our systems in order to appear higher in search results \u2014 using low-quality \u2018content farms,\u2019 hidden text and other deceptive practices.\u201d  Left unsaid was that Google itself generates millions of new subpages without inbound links each day, a fresh page each time someone performs a search. And each of those subpages is filled with text copied from other sites. By programming its search engine to ignore other sites doing the same thing that Google was doing, critics say, the company had made it nearly impossible for competing vertical-search engines, like Foundem, to show up high in Google\u2019s results.  Shivaun and Adam sent email after email to Google executives, but no one responded with anything useful. So the Raffs started making phone calls. Those didn\u2019t help much, either. Adam and Shivaun had worked in technology for decades. They were well known and had connections to important people inside Google and at other big firms. But none of that seemed to matter.  As the months went by and Foundem\u2019s bank accounts dwindled, the Raffs, desperate, began approaching other websites, offering to adapt their technology to power those sites\u2019 internal search engines. Soon they were providing back-end technology for a popular motorcycle site and a large magazine publisher. Eventually, about 2.5 million people were seeing Foundem\u2019s search results each month. Foundem was named one of Britain\u2019s best travel comparison sites by The Times of London and celebrated on a popular British gadget show. But without traffic from Google, the Raffs were barely holding on.  Three years passed this way. Some nights, Shivaun would sit at her computer, exhausted, Googling phrase after phrase \u2014 How do you lift a Google website penalty? Who at Google reviews mistakes? Google and deindexed and phone number and help \u2014 hoping that some magic combination of words might yield a new solution. \u201cIt just felt so unfair,\u201d Shivaun told me. \u201cWe had great technology. It was winning awards. But we couldn\u2019t even get an explanation from Google about why we weren\u2019t showing up.\u201d Eventually, they sought out a public relations firm, in the hope that a newspaper article might get Google\u2019s attention. The P.R. firm had an additional suggestion: Why not file an antitrust complaint? To Adam and Shivaun, that seemed like a waste of time. If Microsoft had been able to shrug off the antitrust attacks of the United States government, why would Google care about a complaint filed by some small firm?  But they didn\u2019t see many other options. So Adam and Shivaun pulled out their laptops and began assembling a long document detailing everything they had experienced. Then they went to Brussels, to the headquarters of the European Commission, the agency charged with regulating competitive behavior, and filed a complaint accusing Google of violating antimonopoly laws.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  As the years passed, Shivaun and Adam got into the habit of visiting message boards where people obsessively discussed Google\u2019s many peculiarities. They began to notice an interesting pattern among companies complaining about the search giant: Often, the aggrieved parties had, in some way, posed some kind of threat to Google\u2019s business. And they seemed to have suffered dire consequences.  There was, for instance, Skyhook Wireless, which had invented a new navigation system that competed with Google\u2019s location software and had signed major deals with the cellphone manufacturers Samsung and Motorola. Skyhook\u2019s accuracy \u201cis better than ours,\u201d one Google manager speculated in an internal email later revealed in a lawsuit filed by Skyhook against Google. Not long after that note was written, according to the lawsuit, a high-ranking Google official pressured Samsung and Motorola to end their relationships with Skyhook \u2014 and implied that if they didn\u2019t, Google could make it impossible for them to ship their phones on time. (Google has denied doing anything inappropriate.) Soon, Samsung and Motorola canceled their Skyhook contracts. Skyhook sued Google, and though one suit was dismissed, Google ended up paying $90 million to settle a patent-infringement claim. But by then it was too late. Skyhook\u2019s founders, bereft of other partnership options, had been forced to sell their company at a large discount.  Then there was Yelp, a website with millions of user-generated reviews of local brewpubs, auto-body shops and other businesses. Yelp grew quickly as local queries \u2014 like \u201cbest nearby steakhouse\u201d \u2014 became a third of all online searches. For years, Yelp appeared near or at the top of millions of Google searches. Google, hoping to capitalize on that traffic, tried to buy Yelp in 2009, but Yelp\u2019s founders rejected those advances. Then Google started pulling Yelp\u2019s content into its own results, which meant many users didn\u2019t have to visit Yelp\u2019s website. Yelp complained \u2014 to Google and later to the F.T.C. \u2014 but Google said the only alternative was for Yelp to remove its content from Google altogether, according to documents filed with federal regulators. The same thing happened at other fast-growing review sites like TripAdvisor and Citysearch, which also complained to the F.T.C. \u201cWe still exist,\u201d says Luther Lowe, a vice president at Yelp, \u201cbut Google did everything it could to ensure that we\u2019d never present a threat to them. It\u2019s bullying, but they\u2019re the 800-pound gorilla.\u201d  The more Adam and Shivaun looked, the more examples they found. Getty Images had created a popular search engine to help users comb through the firm\u2019s 170 million photographs and other visual art. Then, in 2013, Google adjusted how it displayed images so that rather than directing people to Getty\u2019s website, users could easily see and download Getty\u2019s high-definition images from Google itself. \u201cOur traffic immediately fell 85 percent,\u201d says Yoko Miyashita, Getty\u2019s general counsel. \u201cWe wrote to Google, and said, Hey, this isn\u2019t cool. And their response was, \u2018Well, if you don\u2019t agree to these terms, we\u2019ll just exclude you\u2019 \u201d \u2014 by letting Getty remove itself from the search engine entirely, Miyashita said. \u201cThat\u2019s not really a choice, because if you aren\u2019t on Google, you basically don\u2019t exist.\u201d  TradeComet.com, which operated a vertical-search engine for finding business products, initially prospered by buying ads on Google, but as the site grew, Google \u201craised my prices by 10,000 percent, which strangled our business virtually overnight,\u201d the company\u2019s C.E.O. at the time, Dan Savage, said when he filed an antitrust lawsuit in 2009. KinderStart.com, a vertical-search engine for parents, sued Google after it received a \u201cPageRank\u201d of zero, making it essentially unfindable. (TradeComet.com\u2019s suit was dismissed on a technicality; KinderStart.com\u2019s was dismissed for insufficient evidence.)

Shivaun and Adam filled notepads with the names of companies that had complained about Google\u2019s tactics \u2014 eJustice, a vertical-search engine for legal information; NexTag, the fellow price-comparison site; BDZV, a group of German newspapers. They printed out lawsuits and regulatory complaints until their living room was a maze of paper.  Eventually the Raffs reached out to the F.T.C., which, they knew, was the American equivalent of the European Commission\u2019s antitrust office, and the U.S. regulators invited them to visit. The F.T.C.\u2019s staff, it turned out, had been quietly collecting complaints about Google for years. In 2012, those officials wrote a confidential 160-page report that said Google had \u201cadopted a strategy of demoting, or refusing to display, links to certain vertical websites in highly commercial categories.\u201d That memo, about half of which was accidentally sent to reporters at The Wall Street Journal after they submitted a Freedom of Information Act request, said that \u201cGoogle\u2019s conduct has resulted \u2014 and will result \u2014 in real harm to consumers and to innovation.\u201d  \u201cGoogle has strengthened its monopolies over search and search advertising through anticompetitive means,\u201d which \u201cwill have lasting negative effects on consumer welfare,\u201d F.T.C. officials wrote. They cited instances in which Google seemed purposely to be privileging less useful information, substandard search results and suboptimal links. \u201cAlthough it displays its flight search above any natural search results for flight-booking sites, Google does not provide the most flight options for travelers,\u201d the regulators wrote. Whereas a decade earlier someone searching for steakhouses would have seen a long list of websites, now the most noticeable results pointed to Google\u2019s own listings, including Google maps, Google local search or advertisers paying Google. Some F.T.C. staff recommended \u201cthat the Commission issue a complaint against Google\u201d for copying material and certain advertising and contract practices, though not search-engine bias.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Google responded to the report\u2019s claims by arguing that the changes it made to the search engine benefited users. \u201cOur testing has consistently showed that users want quick answers to their queries,\u201d Google said in a statement when contacted about this article. \u201cIf you are searching for weather, you probably want a forecast, not just links to weather sites.\u201d And when it comes to online shopping, the statement read, \u201cif someone is searching for products, they likely want information about price and where they can buy it. They probably don\u2019t want to be taken to another site where they have to enter their search again. . . . We absolutely do not make changes to our search algorithm to disadvantage competitors.\u201d Claims to the contrary, like those made by Foundem, are untrue, Google maintained. \u201cWe make hundreds of changes to search every year, all with the same goal: Delivering users the best, most relevant search results,\u201d the company continued. \u201cEach change, large and small, affects millions of sites, some who see their rankings improve, others who drop.\u201d And, Google concluded, \u201cour ultimate responsibility is to deliver the best results possible to our users, not specific placements for sites within our results.\u201d  When the F.T.C.\u2019s politically appointed leadership considered the staff\u2019s recommendations, they declined to sue Google, surprising many inside the agency. \u201cWhile not everything Google did was beneficial, on balance, we did not believe that the evidence supported an F.T.C. challenge,\u201d the agency\u2019s chairman at the time, Jon Leibowitz, said when he announced the decision in 2013.  The F.T.C.\u2019s decision, according to agency insiders, was motivated in part by a debate that has also sparked battles within antitrust courts over the last 40 years: Should the law protect consumers or encourage competition? They\u2019re not always synonymous. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t consumers who were complaining about Standard,\u201d says Hovenkamp, the antitrust scholar. \u201cIt was the other oil companies.\u201d Similarly, few users are kvetching about Google; it\u2019s primarily other tech firms. United States judges have increasingly held that the government must show consumer harm to win in court.  Adam and Shivaun didn\u2019t have to wait for the official F.T.C. announcement to know that their case was going nowhere. Meeting with officials in Washington, they could tell: These people were not going to prosecute. They had come to the United States at their own expense. They had written memo after memo arguing that Google was treating them unfairly and as a result hurting users. They had done everything they were asked. Standard Oil controlled 64 percent of the market for refined petroleum when the Supreme Court broke it into dozens of pieces. Google and Facebook today control an estimated 60 to 70 percent of the U.S. digital advertising market. And the F.T.C. seemed happy to let them keep doing it. To the Raffs, it felt as if history was repeating itself, as if the pointless, ineffectual Microsoft case was happening all over again. It felt as if nobody cared.  If you are younger than 29 \u2014 which just happens to be the average age of a Google employee, according to a survey done by PayScale \u2014 then odds are good you don\u2019t remember much about the Microsoft antitrust battles of the 1990s. So, a quick primer: For almost a decade, starting in 1993, federal and state prosecutors besieged Microsoft in courtrooms across the nation, arguing that the company had acted in ways that were predatory and dishonest to preserve its software monopoly. One Microsoft executive was quoted in court as threatening to \u201ccut off\u201d the \u201cair supply\u201d of a competitor. \u201cIs Bill Gates the \u201990s answer to Don Corleone?\u201d Time magazine asked. \u201cI expected to find a bloody computer monitor in my bed,\u201d a witness told investigators.  Along the way, Microsoft was accused of widespread bullying, coercion and general obnoxiousness. And Microsoft basically said: Whatever. \u201cThere\u2019s one guy in charge of licenses,\u201d Bill Gates told reporters after he signed a consent decree with the Department of Justice in 1994. \u201cHe\u2019ll read the agreement.\u201d Everyone else, the implication was, would ignore it.  Even when a judge ruled in 2000 that Microsoft was violating antitrust law, conventional wisdom held that the victory was largely pyrrhic. Microsoft successfully appealed, and prosecutors eventually threw in the towel, agreeing to abandon their attacks and settle if Microsoft agreed to token reforms, such as making its products more compatible with competitors\u2019 software and giving three independent observers unfettered access to the company\u2019s records, employees and source code. Microsoft\u2019s executives thought that three observers, versus 48,000 employees, sounded like pretty good odds.  This was the history the Raffs recalled when they heard the F.T.C. was abandoning its investigation. But then, they also remembered a discussion they had once had with a lawyer named Gary Reback, who told them that everything they\u2019d heard about the Microsoft trials was wrong. Reback is something of a legend in Silicon Valley, both because of his accomplishments as an antitrust provocateur and because of his anxious \u2014 some might say paranoid \u2014 worldview. Reback has been known to call other lawyers late at night and leave long, obsessively detailed voice mail messages about legal arguments and economic theories. He was featured on a 1997 cover of Wired magazine with the headline \u201cThis Lawyer Is Bill Gates\u2019s Worst Nightmare,\u201d a boast that wasn\u2019t far-off: Working on behalf of clients like Netscape and Sun Microsystems, Reback had browbeaten the Department of Justice into suing Microsoft for antitrust.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  By the time Adam and Shivaun started visiting the F.T.C., Reback had exchanged his antipathy of Microsoft for a disdain of Google and had accompanied them on their visits with regulators. There\u2019s a loose coalition of economists and legal theorists who call themselves the New Brandeis Movement (critics call them \u201cantitrust hipsters\u201d), who believe that today\u2019s tech giants pose threats as significant as Standard Oil a century ago. \u201cAll of the money spent online is going to just a few companies now,\u201d says Reback (who disdains the New Brandeis label). \u201cThey don\u2019t need dynamite or Pinkertons to club their competitors anymore. They just need algorithms and data.\u201d  Reback had told Adam and Shivaun that it was important for them to keep up their fight, no matter the setbacks, and as evidence he pointed to the Microsoft trial. Anyone who said that the 1990s prosecution of Microsoft didn\u2019t accomplish anything \u2014 that it was companies like Google, rather than government lawyers, that humbled Microsoft \u2014 didn\u2019t know what they were talking about, Reback said. In fact, he argued, the opposite was true: The antitrust attacks on Microsoft made all the difference. Condemning Microsoft as a monopoly is why Google exists today, he said.  Surprisingly, some people who worked at Microsoft in the 1990s and early 2000s agree with him. In the days when federal prosecutors were attacking Microsoft day and night, the company might have publicly brushed off the salvos, insiders say. But within the workplace, the attitude was totally different. As the government sued, Microsoft executives became so anxious and gun-shy that they essentially undermined their own monopoly out of terror they might be pilloried again. It wasn\u2019t the consent decrees or court decisions that made the difference, according to multiple current and former Microsoft employees. It was \u201cthe constant scrutiny and being in the newspaper all the time,\u201d said Gene Burrus, a former Microsoft lawyer. \u201cPeople started second-guessing themselves. No one wanted to test the regulators anymore.\u201d  In public, Bill Gates was declaring victory, but inside Microsoft, executives were demanding that lawyers and other compliance officials \u2014 the kinds of people who, previously, were routinely ignored \u2014 be invited to every meeting. Software engineers began casually dropping by attorneys\u2019 desks and describing new software features, and then asking, in desperate whispers, if anything they\u2019d mentioned might trigger a subpoena. One Microsoft senior executive moved an extra chair into his office so a compliance official could sit alongside him during product reviews. Every time a programmer detailed a new idea, the executive turned to the official, who would point his thumb up or down like a capricious Roman emperor.  In the early 2000s, Microsoft\u2019s top executives told some divisions that their plans would be proactively shared with competitors \u2014 literally describing what the company intended to create before software was even built \u2014 to make sure it wouldn\u2019t offend anyone who was likely to sue. Microsoft\u2019s engineers were outraged. But they went along with it.  And most important, as Microsoft lived under government scrutiny, employees abandoned what had been nascent internal discussions about crushing a young, emerging competitor \u2014 Google. There had been informal conjectures about reprogramming Microsoft\u2019s web browser, the popular Internet Explorer, so that anytime people typed in \u201cGoogle,\u201d they would be redirected to MSN Search, according to company insiders. Or, perhaps a warning message might pop up: \u201cDid you know Google uses your data in ways you can\u2019t control?\u201d  Microsoft was so powerful, and Google so new, that the young search engine could have been killed off, some insiders at both companies believe. \u201cBut there was a new culture of compliance, and we didn\u2019t want to get in trouble again, so nothing happened,\u201d Burrus said. The myth that Google humbled Microsoft on its own is wrong. The government\u2019s antitrust lawsuit is one reason that Google was eventually able to break Microsoft\u2019s monopoly.  \u201cIf Microsoft hadn\u2019t been sued, all of technology would be different today,\u201d Reback told me. We\u2019ve known since Standard Oil that advances in technology make it easier for monopolies to emerge. But what\u2019s less recognized is the importance of antitrust in making sure those new technologies spread to everyone else. In 1969 the Justice Department started a lawsuit against IBM for antitrust violations that lasted 13 years. The government eventually surrendered, but in an earlier attempt to mollify prosecutors, IBM eliminated its practice of bundling hardware and software, a shift that essentially created the software industry. Suddenly, new start-ups could get a foothold simply by writing programs rather than building machines. Microsoft was founded a few years later and soon outpaced IBM.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Or consider AT&T, which was sued by the government in 1974, fought in court for eight years and then slyly agreed to divest itself of some businesses if it could keep its most valuable assets. Critics complained AT&T was getting the deal of a lifetime. But then start-ups like Sprint and MCI made millions building on technologies AT&T championed, and AT&T found itself struggling to compete. It\u2019s completely wrong to say that antitrust doesn\u2019t matter, Reback argues. \u201cThe internet only exists because we broke up AT&T. The software industry exists because Johnson sued IBM.\u201d  It was critical that the Raffs continue fighting, Reback told them. Social embarrassment and sustained attacks have the power to succeed when courtrooms or political agencies fail. After their F.T.C. disappointment, the Raffs flew back to England to consider their options. And then one night they were at home watching television when the phone rang. Someone they had met in Brussels was calling to share some remarkable news. The European Commission had issued a decision on the complaint they filed six years before.  What changed everything was a middle-aged Danish politician named Margrethe Vestager, who had recently been named the European Union\u2019s commissioner for competition. Vestager was an unusual choice for the post. She wasn\u2019t a populist crusader or a pro-business acolyte; she was, instead, a moderate whose claim to fame, at that point, was having served as an inspiration for the television show \u201cBorgen,\u201d a fictional series about a Danish politician. But Vestager was awarded the commissioner\u2019s post in 2014 after arguing that European marketplaces needed to do a better job of giving everyone an equal chance to succeed. Since assuming her office, Vestager has become, unexpectedly, the most prominent antitrust official in the world, invited to speak at conferences and mobbed by autograph seekers.  By the time Vestager took office, Google had already transitioned its price-comparison service to its present incarnation, which is effectively an advertising system that prominently features links only from companies that pay for the promotion. (Users are notified by a small logo that says \u201csponsored.\u201d) After reviewing the complaints submitted by the Raffs and others, Vestager announced she intended to formally charge Google with antitrust violations. (She has also embarked on investigations into the European tax practices of Starbucks, Amazon and Apple, as well as anticompetitive tactics at Qualcomm, Facebook and Gazprom.)  Over the next two years, Vestager\u2019s staff reviewed data from 1.7 billion Google queries. They scrutinized how people fared when they conducted searches on topics in which Google had a vested interest, versus those where the company had nothing to gain. Then, in June of last year, the commission issued its final verdict: \u201cWhat Google has done is illegal under E.U. antitrust rules,\u201d Vestager said in a statement released at the time. \u201cIt denied other companies the chance to compete on the merits and to innovate. And most important, it denied European consumers a genuine choice of services and the full benefits of innovation.\u201d Google was ordered to stop giving its own comparison-shopping service an illegal advantage and was fined an eye-popping $2.7 billion, the largest such penalty in the European Commission\u2019s history and more than twice as large as any such fine ever levied by the United States.  The verdict rocked Silicon Valley. Some think Europe\u2019s assertiveness makes it more likely American regulators will act as well. And there\u2019s evidence that\u2019s already starting. Donald Trump appealed to voters, in part, by attacking the tech monopolies. In a case of truly odd bedfellows, that puts him in alignment with Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, who have long called for greater scrutiny of technology companies. Last year, a group of Democratic lawmakers in Congress, led by Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, sponsored legislation to boost antitrust enforcement by forcing companies to assume the burden of showing that a merger won\u2019t hurt the public.  Meanwhile, a bipartisan assortment of state attorneys general have urged the F.T.C. to reopen its investigation of Google. Most major antitrust battles, including the federal suits against Microsoft and Standard Oil, have begun as state actions. A Missouri investigation is particularly notable because the state\u2019s Republican attorney general, Josh Hawley, who is running for the United States Senate, has subpoenaed information to see if Google has manipulated searches to disadvantage potential competitors. \u201cThe Obama-era F.T.C. did not take any enforcement action against Google, did not press this forward and has essentially given them a free pass,\u201d Hawley told reporters after revealing his inquiry in November. \u201cI will not let Missouri consumers and businesses be exploited by industry giants.\u201d  As attacks against Google have escalated, the company has tried to limit the damage. After Yelp complained to the F.T.C. about Google\u2019s stealing its content, Google promised to make it easier for websites to opt out of automatic copying, a pledge it reaffirmed a few months ago. And earlier this month, in exchange for Getty Images\u2019 withdrawing its complaint to the European Commission, Google signed a licensing agreement with Getty promising to more clearly display images\u2019 copyright information. Other titans like Facebook are similarly trying to get ahead of criticisms, voluntarily pledging greater transparency and promising to work more cooperatively with regulators.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  The implication is clear enough: Google and the other tech titans understand that the landscape is shifting. They realize that their halos have become tarnished, that the arguments they once invoked as a digital exception to American economic history \u2014 that the internet economy is uniquely self-correcting, because competition is only a click away \u2014 no longer hold as much weight. \u201cWhen you get as big as Google, you become so powerful that the market bends around you,\u201d Vestager told me. The notion that antitrust law isn\u2019t needed anymore, that we must choose between helping consumers or spurring competition, no longer seems sufficient reason to exempt the tech giants from century-old legal codes. If anything, Vestager\u2019s verdict and state investigations indicate that companies like Google may have more in common with the monopolists of old than most people thought. Silicon Valley\u2019s bigwigs ought to be scared.  \u201cIf Europe can prosecute Google, then we can as well,\u201d says William Kovacic, a law professor and former Republican-appointed chairman of the Federal Trade Commission. \u201cIt\u2019s just a question of willingness now.\u201d  If the internet\u2019s potentates are frightened, however, they\u2019re doing a good job of hiding it. Google has appealed the European Commission\u2019s decision and has vigorously defended itself online. The company\u2019s arguments are the same ones that it was putting forth on company blogs over the course of the investigation. \u201cWe disagree with the European Commission\u2019s argument that our improved Google Shopping results are harming competition,\u201d Google\u2019s top lawyer wrote in one post. The commission \u201cdrew such a narrow definition around online shopping services that it even excluded services like Amazon,\u201d undermining the contention that Google is dominant. \u201cGoogle delivered more than 20 billion free clicks to aggregators over the last decade,\u201d he wrote in another post. Forcing it to \u201cdirect more clicks to price-comparison aggregators would just subsidize sites that have become less useful for consumers.\u201d Google\u2019s data indicates that users appreciate how the search engine has shifted over the years. \u201cThat\u2019s not \u2018favoring\u2019 \u201d Google\u2019s interests, the company said. \u201cThat\u2019s giving customers and advertisers what they find most useful.\u201d  Some legal theorists think that Google might have a point. \u201cTo what extent are consumers, rather than competitors, being harmed by Google?\u201d says Hovenkamp, the antitrust scholar. \u201cIf the answer is \u2018not much,\u2019 then I\u2019m suspicious of an antitrust remedy.\u201d Others say the risks are too high. \u201cThere are very real costs associated with suing a company like Google,\u201d says Geoffrey Manne, executive director of the International Center for Law & Economics, a nonpartisan research center. \u201cYou\u2019re potentially impairing a firm that provides vital services to millions of people, and potentially benefiting competitors who don\u2019t deserve that support.\u201d  Those are fair arguments. But they are also, in some ways, beside the point. Antitrust has never been just about costs and benefits or fairness. It\u2019s never been about whether we love the monopolist. People loved Standard Oil a century ago, and Microsoft in the 1990s, just as they love Google today.  Rather, antitrust has always been about progress. Antitrust prosecutions are part of how technology grows. Antitrust laws ultimately aren\u2019t about justice, as if success were something to be condemned; instead, they are a tool that society uses to help start-ups build on a monopolist\u2019s breakthroughs without, in the process, being crushed by the monopolist. And then, if those start-ups prosper and make discoveries of their own, they eventually become monopolies themselves, and the cycle starts anew. If Microsoft had crushed Google two decades ago, no one would have noticed. Today we would happily be using Bing, unaware that a better alternative once existed. Instead, we\u2019re lucky a quixotic antitrust lawsuit helped to stop that from happening. We\u2019re lucky that antitrust lawyers unintentionally guaranteed that Google would thrive.  Put differently, if you love technology \u2014 if you always buy the latest gadgets and think scientific advances are powerful forces for good \u2014 then perhaps you ought to cheer on the antitrust prosecutors. Because there is no better method for keeping the marketplace constructive and creative than a legal system that intervenes whenever a company, no matter how beloved, grows so large as to blot out the sun. If you love Google, you should hope the government sues it for antitrust offenses \u2014 and you should hope it happens soon, because who knows what wondrous new creations are waiting patiently in the wings.  For the Raffs, however, it\u2019s probably too late. By the time Vestager announced her verdict and record-setting fine last year, it had been 12 years since Adam and Shivaun started Foundem.com. During that time, their lives slowly but inexorably became devoted to battling Google. They had spent thousands of hours corresponding with regulatory agencies across the globe. They had filed a civil suit against Google in British court, a case that is ongoing. They basically shut down Foundem, creating more time for them to give advice to other companies and regulators fighting Google. This consulting work, some of which was funded by Google\u2019s competitors, has helped to keep the Raffs afloat. And if the Raffs win their lawsuit against Google, it could be worth millions. \u201cBut it\u2019s a different business model than we expected,\u201d Adam told me. \u201cIt\u2019s also deeply frustrating, because we became technologists in order to build new technologies. We never intended to be professional plaintiffs or antitrust crusaders.\u201d  One of the most difficult things for the Raffs over the past decade has been figuring out how to explain this journey to themselves and others. Even friends and family didn\u2019t fully understand what was going on. \u201cIt feels really good to be validated like this, to be told we were right,\u201d Shivaun told me, referring to Vestager\u2019s verdict. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t turn back the clock and give us another chance. Even if we win in Brussels, or win our lawsuit, in some ways, we were still defeated.

Other internet giants do much the same.  In addition to its T.P.U. chips, which sit inside its data centers, the company has designed an A.I. chip for its smartphones.  Right now, Google\u2019s new service is focused on a way to teach computers to recognize objects, called computer vision technology. But as time goes on, the new chips will also help businesses build a wider range of services, Mr. Stone said.  At the end of last year, hoping to accelerate its work on driverless cars, Lyft began testing Google\u2019s new chips.

A new wave of artificial intelligence, including services like Google Assistant, are driven by \u201cneural networks,\u201d which are complex algorithms that can learn tasks on their own by analyzing vast amounts of data. By analyzing a database of old customer support phone calls, for example, a neural network can learn to recognize commands spoken into a smartphone. But this requires serious computing power.  Typically, engineers train these algorithms using graphics processing units, or G.P.U.s, which are chips that were originally designed for rendering images for games and other graphics-heavy software. Most of these chips are supplied by Nvidia.  In designing its own A.I. chips, Google was looking to exceed what was possible with these graphics-oriented chips, speed up its own A.I. work and lure more businesses onto its cloud services.  At the same time, Google has gained some independence from Nvidia and an ability to negotiate lower prices with its chip suppliers.  \u201cGoogle has become so big, it makes sense to invest in chips,\u201d said Fred Weber, who spent a decade as the chief technology officer at the chip maker AMD. \u201cThat gives them leverage.

It agreed to use the new Jaguar I-Pace, a battery-powered hatchback unveiled this month, for the service announced Tuesday. After testing, the company expects to start its ride service by the end of the year.  Mr. Krafcik, the Waymo chief, said the company intended to move forward rapidly with a driverless ride service for the public because it was confident its vehicles could operate safely in virtually any driving situation where they would be put into use. In addition to the five million miles its cars have driven in tests, Waymo has run computer simulations equivalent to five billion miles of testing. In these computer models, Waymo uses software to make virtual test drives even more complicated by adding more pedestrians and making distances between cars shorter than in typical road situations, he said.  At a closed site in California, Waymo also tests the performance of its cars in traffic situations based on actual crashes. \u201cWe think we will be the safety benchmark for the world,\u201d said Mr. Krafcik, who worked in operations at Ford and then was Hyundai\u2019s United States chief before his arrival at Waymo.  He noted that Waymo cars were equipped with highly sensitive cameras, radar and three different types of lidar \u2014 a kind of radar based on lasers \u2014 to identify objects, pedestrians and other cars.  Even with the vast computing power of Google, which operates giant data centers around the world, Waymo won\u2019t be able to train its computerized \u201cdriver\u201d to be prepared for everything. \u201cThere are going to be things we can\u2019t predict,\u201d Adam Jonas, an automotive analyst at Morgan Stanley, said at the J.

Elaine Herzberg, 49, was walking her bicycle across the road at a spot without a crosswalk when she was struck. Videos taken by cameras mounted in the Uber vehicle show the safety driver was looking down just before the impact.  The Uber crash prompted Toyota to suspend testing its self-driving cars on public roads as a precaution, although Ford Motor and General Motors said they were proceeding with their efforts.

Waymo also expects to put its technology into trucks and delivery vehicles, as well as buses or other vehicles that ferry riders to mass transportation systems.

But for a product that's to be trusted to capture life's best moments, it doesn't fully deliver on that promise yet. Depending on your lifestyle (and patience level), it can pump out results, but it's usually way more 'miss' than 'hit'.  Google Clips is a camera, but that\u2019s underselling it a bit. It\u2019s a smart camera that utilizes an eerily good machine learning algorithm to identify, then auto-record scenes containing familiar faces, pets and more.  Similar to a normal point-and-shoot, you turn on Clips when you want to use it. There\u2019s a shutter button, too, which you can press to capture seven seconds of still photos encoded in a shareable video file. But to fully take advantage of Clips is to let it run on auto-pilot.  At its best, Clips catches the moments that you aren\u2019t prepared for, ones that you can\u2019t react quickly enough to capture. We all know the feeling of having just missed out on the perfect photo or video \u2013 this camera aims to put an end to that issue. Better yet, Google\u2019s camera succeeds where others don\u2019t by letting you step in front of its lens to participate in your life, even if it can feel a little orchestrated to those in the know of being recorded.  Update: Google has issued a small update to Clips that brings high-resolution manual stills and pinch-to-zoom functionality to the companion app.  Google isn\u2019t oblivious to the fact that most of us already use phones and DSLR cameras to take photos and videos. While those options excel at capturing pinpoint moments in time, Clips is more of a broad strokes approach by comparison, and is said to improve over time thanks to machine learning.  Putting its smarts aside, this camera will feel trivial for some from a usability perspective. Sure, you can carry it around and capture things that way, though why not just use a phone, which likely houses a more capable lens? Also, I\u2019ve learned that it\u2019s a really big ask to make sure that my life unfolds within the camera\u2019s 130-degree field of view. I often found that, coincidentally, more interesting stuff was always happening off-screen. It takes more effort than I expected to make Clips feel useful.  At $249, Clips isn\u2019t the most affordable way of catching the moments that fall between the gaps of your DSLR or phone use. And unfortunately, throughout the review process, it showed that it's not so great in its current form. I can't say that it captured anything that really showed off its unique ability to know, better than I do, when\u2019s best to start capturing.  For now, you can safely stick with your trusty camera. But we'll keep watching Clips and will make a note should it improve.  Design  Like other Google products, like Google Home, Google Daydream, and Google Pixel 2, Clips is minimalistic, yet quite expressive in its design. While it\u2019s hard to confuse it as anything but a camera, it certainly looks unique compared to other quick-capture cameras like the Samsung Gear 360, appearing more like a large Tile tracker keyring than something that takes footage.  On its front, Clips\u2019 lens takes up most of the real estate. It\u2019s a clever, intuitive decision to make twisting it work as its power switch, and thanks to the colored indicator, it\u2019s easy to tell when it\u2019s off or on. Not just that, but there are a series of lights that illuminate when powered on to clue you into what the camera\u2019s doing, as well as notify the general public that, \u201chey, you might be on camera right now\u201d.  Snug beneath the lens is the shutter button, which looks a lot like a fingerprint sensor. Clips is skilled at shooting footage automatically based on what it finds interesting, as instructed by its machine learning algorithm. But Google told us that the main reason behind the button is simply because there are some moments when you\u2019ll have better judgment than Clips will.  Moving to the back, Google\u2019s mini camera is clad in a creamy teal shell that feels built to last. But if don\u2019t want to subject it to scratches or scuffs, you can pop it in the included silicon shell. It\u2019s actually how this camera gets its \u201cClips\u201d moniker \u2013 you can clip it anywhere it will fit. I\u2019ve found that, despite its flexibility, the clip wasn\u2019t able to fit onto much in my apartment. Your mileage will vary, of course. But one thing that the clip is useful for in any situation is as a more stable stand. Clips can stand by itself, but it isn\u2019t so wobbly with the case.

This is clearly just the first step for Google Pay, though, and it seems that the company has big plans for the service.  In the near future, for example, Google Pay will be on all Google Products. So whether you\u2019re using desktop Chrome or your Google Home, you\u2019ll be able to use the cards that are saved to your Google Account.

Shares of the Japanese company plunged as much as 9 percent after a spate of Tesla bad-news stories over the past few weeks. First, the U.S. electric-car maker reported yet another fatal crash, then a shortfall in production targets for its mass-market Model 3 and to top it off, a rating downgrade by Moody's Investors Service on liquidity concerns. The cost to insure Panasonic's five-year debt -- a broad gauge of risk -- has risen sharply.  That Panasonic is dancing to Tesla's tune is no big surprise -- it usually does. Investors have long seen the electronics giant as a derivative play on its U.S. customer. Their thesis: more Teslas, more batteries. To be fair, Panasonic does have solid battery technology -- better than the likes of Samsung SDI Co. -- and has focused its efforts on the auto industry. In fact, moments of weakness in Panasonic stock are often seen as an opportune time to buy. This time, there are other factors to consider.  Out of Sync Panasonic risks putting too many eggs in one basket Bloomberg  First, the level of Panasonic's reliance. The Osaka-based company revised down its sales and operating profit estimates for rechargeable batteries for the full fiscal year in February because it had to push out sales plans in North America to \u201cfuture periods.\u201d Its hyped-up gigafactory partnership with Tesla in Nevada has undershot expectations. Panasonic is piling capex into the $5 billion project, in part raising debt to do so. Moody's expects the company to shovel more than 50 percent of its capital spending into the automotive segment including battery plants.  Besides Tesla, Panasonic leans heavily on the broader electric-vehicle industry, where prospects are dimming amid the Trump administration's lackluster interest in green policies. Earlier this month, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it was revising fuel-efficiency standards that allow carmakers \"to make cars that people both want and can afford.\" That damped enthusiasm for the potential growth of electric cars.  Then, there's China, the world's largest electric-vehicle market. Panasonic, along with other foreign battery makers, risks being shut out by new-energy policies aimed at cornering the global market. China's own battery champion, Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., is shoving global competitors aside as it ramps up production and pushes down prices, while reaching standards to supply the likes of BMW AG.  Panasonic started making batteries for hybrid cars in the northeastern city of Dalian only last month, entering a market that's increasingly looking saturated as growing volumes put pressure on margins. Tesla, meanwhile, which sells in China only through exports, may also be at risk of being drawn into the ongoing trade spat with the U.S.  Ahead of the Pack Panasonic trades at a premium to its South Korea battery maker peers Bloomberg  Panasonic stock is down around 7 percent this year in Tokyo and trades at a premium to its South Korean battery peers on 14.4 times forward earnings.

Justin Sullivan/Getty Images  The idea that Apple should buy Tesla has been floated many times.  Apple now has more than enough cash coming back to the US to do the deal.  Tesla needs to be saved from its delusional idea about the company's future growth \u2014 and Apple needs to be saved from the disaster of its car project.  Last November, Rolling Stone published a profile of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, written by Neil Strauss, a neo-gonzo journalist who made his name with a book about pickup culture. And in that interview Musk made a confession.  \"I wish we could be private with Tesla,\" Musk told Strauss. \"It actually makes us less efficient to be a public company.\"  Tesla has been public since its 2010 IPO and since then the stock has risen from about $20 a share to nearly $400 at one point in 2017. The company's market cap is now close to $60 billion. Investors who jumped in seven years ago have enjoyed a return of nearly 1,200%.  Musk might be the only person who wishes Tesla were private. Even short-sellers, recently clobbered by Tesla's surge, have been delighted when the stock has gone through one of its periodic swoons of $100 in a few months. And ironically, Musk's next ten years of compensation are now completely tied to Tesla's market performance, which the board of directors thinks can yield a $650-billion market cap.  That's delusional. In many ways, it sets Musk up for both continued inefficiency \u2014 a lot of second-guessing about investments in automation, for example, at the expense of hitting production targets \u2014 and potentially epic failure. It also represents a radical formulation of shareholder value theory.  Tesla is wildly overvalued, and what it needs now isn't a fatter stock price but rather an ability to satisfy customers. For the Model 3 mass-market vehicle, currently stalled amid production bottlenecks, Tesla has 400,000 mostly unfulfilled pre-orders.  Apple buying Tesla is an idea that always seems to be on the table  Apple CEO Tim Cook. Getty  In the past, there's been talk about somebody buying Tesla. Usually, Apple is the one that gets everybody's heart racing. I've shot down this idea several times. But with the announcement of Musk's new pay package, I think Tesla needs to be rescued from itself. And that Musk should get his wish.  Tesla is worth so much that there aren't very many companies able to buy the automaker. And Tesla going truly private would be too much of a reversal of history as well as a financial improbability, although if the bottom falls out some investors might someday snap up what's left of Tesla on the cheap.  Apple, thanks to the new tax bill, will repatriate over $250 billion is cash that it has been keeping overseas. Even after paying taxes on it, at the reduced corporate rate, it will have arguably too much left over. It could easily wind up going into share buybacks or a dividend, or Apple could continue its pattern of making small acquisitions.  Or the company, which is sitting on a mature iPhone business that mints the profits but could be looking at more severe growth headwinds in coming years, could swing for the fences and get a piece of the multi-trillion global transportation industry. If Tim Cook agrees with the Tesla board that the company will be worth $650 billion in a decade, then buying Tesla now would be a staggering bargain.  The obvious question is, \"Who would be Tesla's CEO?\" Musk's pay package is designed to ensure that it's him, an extreme evolution of addressing the \"great man\" risk that companies led by visionary founders face. But Musk is also running SpaceX and he's on the verge of launching a huge rocket that could pave the way for a Mars mission. Dealing with Tesla's difficulties could be seen as a needless distraction.  That said, Musk could remain CEO of Tesla as an independent business unit of Apple, while Tim Cook would run the entire show (Musk could also relinquish the CEO title but continue as chairman of the board). In a way, Cook isn't really a CEO in the Musk/Steve Jobs vein anyway. He's more like a mega-COO.  And that's just what Tesla actually needs right now. If it was Jobs who rescued Apple and put it on the path that led to the iPod and the iPhone, it was Cook who turned the company into the profit-making colossus it has become. The guy is a supply-chain genius. Making stuff is his bag. And at the moment, Tesla is struggling mightily to make stuff, falling well behind its ambitious production targets for the Model 3 mass-market vehicle.  Tesla would also witness its cash-burn challenges \u2014 over $1 billion per quarter \u2014 vanish. Apple could fund losses for years.  Tesla could help Apple get into the car business The Apple Car project isn't going well. Apple  Apple has a history of falling into innovations troughs. It's in one now, following the monumental success of the iPhone. The Apple Watch hasn't been a gamechanger, and the company is chasing Amazon on smart speakers. Apple clearly wants to do something in the transportation space, but thus far its efforts have been at best confused and at worst pathetic.  Buying Tesla would change that overnight. The Apple Car, really, is a Tesla car anyway. The whole philosophy behind Tesla's vehicles, and especially the ultra-minimalist Model 3, is Apple-esque. The wait for the Apple Car would be immediately over.  And that would enable Apple to focus on bringing to Tesla what Apple's engineers and designers are now probably working on: an entirely new vehicle interface \u2014 an operating system for the car of the future.  Tesla has aspects of such a system in place, from over-the-air software updates to an increasing focus on single screens for all vehicle operations. Apple would enhance and unify these components and transform them into something unexpected. This is Apple's mojo: take something that works and make it much, much better.  Missing out on a mega-return \u2014 but one that isn't likely  Tesla market cap has become epic. Andy Kiersz/Business Insider  For investors, of course, Apple buying Tesla would eliminate any chance of a mega-return. But I think the odds are low that the 1,000%-plus payback of the past seven years will be matched by another 1,000% surge over the next ten years (Tesla is, after all, 14 years old \u2014 hardly a startup). If Tesla stays public, stockholders will also have to put up with numerous, diluting capital raises and the ever-present threat that Tesla's lack of cash and debt burden will lead to a bankruptcy.  If Apple bought Tesla, the carmaker's growth would be piped into Apple shares, and Tesla investors would certainly get a premium for their holdings, as Apple can afford to overpay. I don't even think that government regulators would have issues with the merger. Sure, Apple would be buying the dominant electric-car manufacturer. But as of 2018, the EV market makes up only 1% of global sales.  I would have stuck to my guns on the foolishness of an Apple acquisition of Tesla were it not for the reckless pay package that Tesla concocted for Musk. But I now think that Tesla is fueling a dangerous idea about the company's capabilities. Somebody needs to save Tesla from its hubris. That somebody is Apple.", "stock": "TSLA"}, {"url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/10-things-in-tech-you-need-to-know-today-january-24-2018-1", "label": -1, "source": "business-insider", "date": "2018-01-23", "article": "Apple CEO Tim Cook.

We know relatively little about how Tesla will be piloting its truck thus far, but this new info sheds some light on the charging component of the puzzle.  Tesla will be working with Anheuser-Busch, Pepsi and UPS at least to build out these origin point chargers, the report claims, and then the initial routes which the Semis will run will be short enough that the trucks can go out and back again on a single charge. Pepsi told Reuters that it\u2019ll look into potentially partnering with other companies using Tesla trucks to create combined charging facilities.  The trucks, which obviously have far greater battery capacity than Tesla\u2019s consumer vehicles, would require charging stations that can deliver more power, more quickly, and Musk has previously suggested Tesla might build a network of so-called \u201cmega-chargers\u201d that gather power using solar panels, and that can deliver a full charge to a Semi in as little as 30 minutes using high-capacity power delivery.  Tesla confirmed to Reuters that it\u2019s in discussions with larger clients regarding construction of charging infrastructure for the vehicles, and pilot client Loblaws also said it\u2019s hoping to use solar energy, and is also looking at other potential partners beyond Tesla to make charging facilities work.  The Tesla Semi, unveiled last year, will have a max range of as many as 500 miles, per the company, and starts at $150,000 for a lower-range version.

In addition, the company has set a dozen revenue and adjusted profit goals. Mr. Musk would receive 1.68 million shares, or about 1 percent of the company, only after he reaches milestones for both.  But to put these numbers in perspective, Tesla is worth only about $59 billion today.  If Mr. Musk were somehow to increase the value of Tesla to $650 billion \u2014 a figure many experts would contend is laughably impossible and would make Tesla one of the five largest companies in the United States, based on current valuations \u2014 his stock award could be worth as much as $55 billion (assuming the company does not issue any more shares over the next decade, which is unrealistic). Even reaching several of the milestones would bring him billions.  Mr. Musk\u2019s critics \u2014 and there are many \u2014 are likely to contend that the new compensation plan is just the company\u2019s latest publicity stunt. He has been called a modern-day P.T. Barnum who has created the illusion of success while consistently missing production estimates. The company continues to lose money; at one point last year, it was losing almost a half-million dollars an hour, according to Bloomberg News. Jim Chanos, a short-seller who has bet against Tesla\u2019s shares \u2014 and has thus far been on the losing side of that trade \u2014 has contended that Tesla is worthless.  But Mr. Musk\u2019s compensation plan is no illusion: He gets paid only if the company succeeds over the long term with significant gains in market cap. And it\u2019s impossible for him to manipulate the system by trying to prop up the stock price for a temporary period. Under the terms of the arrangement, even once his shares vest, he has to hold them an additional five years before he is allowed to sell them.  The way the arrangement is structured, each milestone is a blunt instrument: He either reaches it or gets nothing.  \u201cIf all that happens over the next 10 years is that Tesla\u2019s value grows by 80 or 90 percent, then my amount of compensation would be zero,\u201d he said. (His calculations were based on the stock price at the beginning of this year when the company was worth about $50 billion.)  Still, he contended, \u201cI actually see the potential for Tesla to become a trillion-dollar company within a 10-year period.\u201d  Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Many other companies have installed outsize packages that often come at the expense of shareholders because the executives get paid even when they underperform their peers.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Asked how he thinks shareholders should feel about Mr. Musk\u2019s new pay package, Ira Ehrenpreis, chairman of Tesla\u2019s compensation committee, told me, \u201cIt\u2019s heads you win, tails you don\u2019t lose,\u201d meaning if Mr. Musk is gaining billions then shareholders are winning, too. And if Mr. Musk does not perform, shareholders pay nothing.  Mr. Musk\u2019s new compensation plan is similar to the previous one put in place when the company was worth $3.2 billion in 2012. Only now, the numbers are much larger. That package also paid Mr. Musk only when he reached certain market value and operational benchmarks. And virtually nobody could imagine Tesla would be worth 17 times what it was back then.  Mr. Musk has reached all but one of the metrics in that plan.  Even though Mr. Musk\u2019s shares have vested, he has not sold them except to pay the taxes on the grants. His current stake is worth $13 billion.  Mr. Musk does not take a salary, although under California State law, Tesla is required to pay him at least minimum wage. Tesla sends him checks that pay him a little more than $37,000 annually. \u201cI don\u2019t cash it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just ends up accumulating in a Tesla bank account somewhere.\u201d  To afford to live, Mr. Musk has borrowed against his shares, a practice that some corporate executives have questioned. Mr. Musk insists that the loans are such a small portion of his stake in the company that even if Tesla shares were to fall precipitously, it would not impact him or the company.  If Mr. Musk succeeds in hitting some of his benchmarks, it would also mean that the company\u2019s employees, including those who work on the factory floor, who get paid in both cash and stock, could become wealthy.  Under the terms of the deal, which is subject to shareholder approval, Mr. Musk has to remain the company\u2019s chief executive, though the agreement would allow him to become chief product officer and executive chairman with a chief executive reporting to him. He said he saw that as a possibility only if the company became so large that he needed to recruit a top person to oversee the operations.  Mr. Musk has often said he is not driven by money. So what is it about this incentive plan that appeals to him?  \u201cNone of it is intended for dynastic wealth creation,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reason that it\u2019s important to me personally is that there\u2019s some pretty big things that I want to do.\u201d  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  \u201cI want to contribute as much as possible to humanity becoming a multi-planet species,\u201d he said, alluding to a goal he has talked about often, including having people live on Mars. \u201cThat obviously requires a certain amount of capital.\u201d", "stock": "TSLA"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/27/business/tech-stocks-tesla-nvidia.html", "label": -1, "source": "the-new-york-times", "date": "2018-03-27", "article": "Technology stocks helped propel the nine-year bull market.

Now Tesla has revealed some of the details of the California incident, saying that its Autopilot self-driving technology was activated at the time of the crash. However, the company also says certain warnings were ignored by the driver just before the Model X collided with a concrete barrier.  Autopilot can brake, accelerate, and steer, but it's classed as an assistive technology at the moment, rather than a full autonomous mode \u2013 which hasn't yet been legalized. The Model X driver ignored instructions to take control of the wheel, it would seem.  Crash logs  \"The driver had received several visual and one audible hands-on warning earlier in the drive and the driver's hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds prior to the collision,\" Tesla says in an update.  \"The driver had about five seconds and 150 meters of unobstructed view of the concrete divider with the crushed crash attenuator, but the vehicle logs show that no action was taken.\" Apparently the crash barrier had already been hit in a previous incident, and not repaired in the meantime, leading to more damage for the Tesla car.

As CEO of Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink and Hyperloop, he\u2019s overseeing everything from launching a 12,000-satellite broadband network to building a NYC-to-DC hyperloop to installing computers in our brains .  But with Tesla struggling to hit its production numbers for the new Tesla Model 3 , Musk has stepped in place of his senior vice president of engineering to directly oversee manufacturing at the factory.  Musk had previously tweeted that Tesla would hit 20,000 Model 3 cars manufactured per month by December of last year. He later amended his prediction, stating that by the end of 2018\u2019s spring quarter, Tesla would produce 500 Model 3s per day, or 2,500 per week.  After Jalopink exposed a company memo from Musk stating that the company could now make 2,000 cars per week, and The Information revealed that Musk had taken control of manufacturing, Musk responded angrily on Twitter, but didn\u2019t contradict the claims.  About a year ago, I asked Doug to manage both engineering & production. He agreed that Tesla needed eng & prod better aligned, so we don\u2019t design cars that are crazy hard to build. Right now, tho, better to divide & conquer, so I\u2019m back to sleeping at factory. Car biz is hell \u2026April 2, 2018  Last week, VP Doug Field sent a memo to employees announcing Tesla would reallocate employees to focus on Model 3 production, Bloomberg reported.  He called the industry experts who doubted Tesla\u2019s ability to hit their manufacturing goals \u201ca bunch of haters\u201d and urged employees to work hard to hit the 300-car-per-day milestone.  Tesla\u2019s numbers did rise significantly that week, but Field\u2019s petition to may have been too little, too late for Musk.  Now Musk is sleeping at Tesla\u2019s Gigafactory in Nevada, hoping to ensure Tesla hits its benchmark of 5,000 Model 3s per week by the end of June.  Elon Musk pretended Tesla had gone bankrupt in an April Fools tweet (Courtesy of Elon Musk) (Image: \u00a9 Elon Musk)  In response to this news, Tesla issued a press release with manufacturing numbers for spring 2018.  In the past seven days Tesla made 2,020 Model 3 cars, out of 8,180 total for 2018. For comparison, Telsa also produced 11,730 Model S cars and 10,070 Model X cars this spring, totalling almost 30,000 vehicles.  If Tesla reaches its goal of producing 5,000 per week for the Model 3, then producing 30,000 cars would only take a month and a half. And that wouldn\u2019t even include the Model S and X cars being produced at the same time.  Next week, Tesla reportedly plans to produce 2,000 Model 3s and 2,000 Model S and X cars within seven days. Despite not hitting their Q1 goals, Tesla\u2019s release insists the company is \u201con track\u201d to hit their production numbers for the 3, S and X in 2018.  A race against time and controversy  This news is just the latest in a series of negative press Tesla and Musk have dealt with in the past week.  After Tesla discovered a steering defect in the Model S cars , the company voluntarily recalled 123,000 Model S models for garage repairs. Thankfully, no accidents have been associated with this defect.  But Tesla\u2019s Autopilot is implicated in a fatal Model X crash currently being reviewed by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).  Tesla said in a statement that Autopilot gave the driver \u201cseveral visual and one audible hands-on warning\u201d to avoid the crash, but that the driver did not take action.  All Tesla Model 3 cars have Autopilot enabled, and Tesla said Model 3 drivers are \u201c3.7 times less likely to be involved in a fatal accident\u201d using Autopilot than when driving themselves.  But the NTSB is reportedly \u201cunhappy\u201d that Tesla released confidential investigative knowledge to the public before the agency could issue its own preliminary report on Autopilot.  In a tweet yesterday, Musk defended the decision to discuss the accident, saying Tesla has an obligation to \u201cpublic safety\u201d.  Lot of respect for NTSB, but NHTSA regulates cars, not NTSB, which is an advisory body. Tesla releases critical crash data affecting public safety immediately & always will. To do otherwise would be unsafe.April 2, 2018  With all of these legal distractions and weekly SpaceX launches, will Musk be able to spur on Model 3 manufacturing time? It remains to be seen how Musk will streamline manufacturing directly, though the recent numbers are encouraging for Tesla.

After its infamous Falcon 9 explosion in 2016, SpaceX had a lot riding on a successful launch of its newest and most powerful spacecraft to date.  But over 2.3 million livestream viewers on YouTube (the second biggest stream ever for the service) witnessed a breathtaking, successful launch. The Falcon Heavy escaped atmosphere, launched its payload and returned at least two of its three boosters to their target destinations, all within ten minutes.  [Update: Elon Musk has confirmed the center core missed the drone ship it was meant to land on, reports Engadget . It's the one blemish on an otherwise wildly successful day. The core booster apparently ran out of propellant, meaning it couldn't slow down enough to pull off a successful landing. It also missed the drone ship itself by about 100 meters. Though no footage has been released, it sounds as though the crash landing was quite spectacular.]  Here's a breakdown of every exciting moment of the launch and what the test run means for the future of the commercial space industry and Mars exploration.  Falcon Heavy launch, as it happened  On Tuesday, February 6 at 12:45pm PT/3:45pm ET/ 8:45pm GMT, or 6:45am AEST on Wednesday, February 7, the Falcon Heavy rocket launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida. Within a minute, it hit supersonic speeds, while raucous cheering could be heard by the SpaceX team over the livestream.  At the 2 minute 30 second mark, the rocket's two side boosters shut down and successfully separated from the spacecraft, with Earth\u2019s atmosphere already visible in the background. At 3 minute 15 seconds, and with David Bowie\u2019s Life on Mars playing in the background, the main engine was cut off and released from the craft.  Tesla in space! (Image: \u00a9 SpaceX)  At four minutes, the Tesla Roadster payload was successfully launched out of the craft into its elliptical orbit between Earth and Mars. SpaceX\u2019s spaceman is projected to reach Mars in about six months.  Within eight minutes, the two side boosters had successfully landed directly on their target launch pad. The primary center core, meanwhile, failed to land on the drone ship it was intended to touch down on, missing it by about 100 meters and coming in at about 300mph.  Side boosters land successfully (Image: \u00a9 SpaceX)  Why the Falcon Heavy launch matters  Fans of the book/film The Martian know that you can\u2019t fit everything you need for a visit to Mars on one spacecraft. NASA needs a safe, cost-effective way to transport supplies and tech to the planet well before sending astronauts along.  SpaceX\u2019s Falcon Heavy is the latest in Musk\u2019s rocket lineup looking to fill that niche. It can carry 64 metric tons into orbit, is fully reusable for later launches (if the launch is successful), and only costs $90 million to build.  The cargo for today\u2019s launch was Elon Musk\u2019s personal Tesla Roadster, which was equipped with cameras and a test dummy. The Tesla\u2019s successful cruise towards its destination proves that the Falcon Heavy will be able to carry sensitive technology (and even people) outside of orbit for Mars exploration or colonization.  Tesla Roadster and its 'Starman' passenger in space  The Heavy isn\u2019t the most powerful rocket ever \u2013 that title belongs to the Saturn V, which launched all of the Apollo missions to the moon, and could carry more than double the Falcon\u2019s payload to low-Earth orbit (LEO).  But compared to everyone else building rockets right now, SpaceX is outpacing the competition. NPR reports that the United Launch Alliance\u2019s Delta IV Heavy, the Falcon Heavy\u2019s closest competitor, can only carry half of the Heavy\u2019s payload, and for three times the cost. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos' New Glenn rocket stands almost thirty meters taller than the Falcon Heavy, but it\u2019s designed specifically for staying in Earth\u2019s orbit and could never reach Mars.  NASA is currently developing the Space Launch System (SLS), designed for the same purpose as Falcon Heavy: transporting astronauts \u2013 and, potentially, colonists \u2013 to Mars. According to CNN Money , the SLS won\u2019t launch a test flight until next year, but it should be about 40 meters taller than the Heavy, with potentially double the Falcon Heavy\u2019s liftoff thrust and LEO payload.  However, what we don\u2019t know is how much the SLS costs. New York Times sources claim that NASA might simply scrap the SLS and hire SpaceX\u2019s rockets for the Mars mission instead, considering their cost-effectiveness.  Today\u2019s successful launch could serve as a convincing pitch to NASA that it should sit back and let SpaceX facilitate the agency's Mars missions, despite the center core's failure to land on the drone ship.  Meanwhile, competitors like the Alliance will be feeling the pressure to replicate SpaceX\u2019s success as soon as possible. If it turns out the main engine did make it back home, they may already be too late to beat SpaceX\u2019s amazing first impression.  SpaceX\u2019s next steps  Credit: SpaceX (Image: \u00a9 SpaceX)  Even after an extremely successful launch and two out of three boosters making it back to Earth, this may only be considered a stepping stone in the history of Mars exploration.  In September of last year, Musk announced SpaceX's latest rocket design, the Big Falcon Rocket (BFR), designed to replace and cannibalize the designs of the Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy and Dragon capsule into one package.  According to SpaceX\u2019s projections, the BFR will be able to carry 50 tonnes to Mars and 150 tonnes to LEO (the Falcon Heavy can carry 16.8 and 63.8 tonnes to the Red Planet, respectively), and it\u2019ll only use one booster instead of three. Plus, there's the claim that its pastiche design will make BFR much cheaper than the Falcon Heavy.  Based on today's launch, we're extremely excited to see SpaceX's next iteration of their Mars mission flagship \u2013 as well as what NASA or others might unveil to rival it.", "stock": "TSLA"}, {"url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/evs-explained", "label": -1, "source": "techradar", "date": "2018-04-10", "article": "From the day it was announced, back in March 2016, the Tesla Model 3 has been billed as the car to take electric vehicles mainstream.  Starting at $35,000, it has a claimed 220 miles of range, is fitted with all of the hardware necessary to drive fully autonomously (Tesla says), and might one day be spoken about by historians in the same breath as the Ford Model T and Citroen 2CV.  At least, that was the case two years ago. Now, as Model 3 production finally speeds up and there\u2019s a chance it might be available in the UK and Europe by the very end of the year, Tesla finds it no longer has the EV market to itself.  General Motors, Ford, Jaguar Land Rover and the Volkswagen Group are all poised to launch electric vehicles of their own, and they will do so with a century of experience behind them.  This gives us the perfect opportunity to take stock and evaluate the current situation with electric cars.  How do EVs work?  Fundamentally, electric cars work in broadly the same way as ones powered by petrol, diesel or even hydrogen. There is a fuel source, a drive unit, and a gearbox to provide motion forwards and backwards. Above this there are passenger and luggage compartments.  Electric vehicles (EVs) are still cars, and anyone who has driven an automatic vehicle will feel immediately at home behind the wheel of one.  There is a distinct lack of engine noise, of course, and the initial acceleration of EVs is often greater than that of an similarly sized internal combustion car. Or, in the case of the Tesla Model S P100D, EVs can literally be the quickest accelerating cars on sale today.  The Kia Soul EV's battery pack  Due to their huge weight, the batteries of EVs are fitted to the floor. This not only offers a large and mostly flat space for the cells to sit, but also helps to lower the car\u2019s centre of gravity.  Although they weigh comfortably over two tonnes, the Tesla Model S and Model X offer decent handling because of the heavy battery being low down.  They, like other EVs, also benefit from extra cabin space thanks to there being no transmission tunnel between the seats.  Are EVs different to drive?  The biggest different between internal combustion engine (ICE) and EV cars during everyday driving is the latter\u2019s regenerative braking system, which captures kinetic energy (caused by the forward motion of the car) and feeds it into the battery whenever you lift off the accelerator.  EVs still have a brake pedal, but it can be used less often due to extra retardation caused by the regen system.  Whenever people ask us about electric cars, or when we've with someone when they drive an EV for the first time, we explain how regenerative braking is the biggest difference during everyday driving.  Nissan currently advertises the new electric Leaf by talking about its \u2018one-pedal\u2019 operation, where the accelerator is used to speed up and slow down.  This is true, in a way, but the Leaf - as with all cars - still has a brake pedal. It just doesn\u2019t need to be used very often, because electric cars slow down far more abruptly than ICE cars do when you lift off the accelerator.  The best way to think about it is this: lifting off the accelerator a little causes the car to slow gradually, while lifting further or fully off the pedal causes it to slow more sharply, and the brake lights will come on.  Indeed, we\u2019ve often found we can leave a motorway and use only the accelerator pedal to slow down to walking pace by the time we reach the junction.  It only takes a few hours with an EV to drive with one pedal almost all of the time. You only really need the brake pedal in emergencies, when coming to a complete halt, or when driving on a cold morning, before the battery pack and regen system has had time to warm up.  Why electric?  There are many reasons to consider an EV over an ICE car. The obvious one is the lack of localized emissions.  We say localized because, while the car doesn't have an exhaust so can\u2019t contribute to city center smog like a petrol or diesel car, there is still pollution caused during the construction of the car - and in many cases the production of the electricity it runs on, too.  There are many debates to be had here, regarding the environmental impact of producing electricity from a gas or coal-fired power station, and what happens to the lithium battery pack once the car is no longer roadworthy, but that is for another article.  The all-electric Nissan Leaf  Other benefits of EV ownership include no need to buy engine oil, and less of a need for replacing the disc brakes and pads, because of the regenerative braking I mentioned earlier.  EVs are also quiet, very easy to drive, have automatic gearboxes, and filling the battery with electricity is cheaper than using petrol or diesel to go a similar distance.  If you install a charger at home (as almost all EV owners do) and power this with solar panels, then you can reasonably expect some car journeys to cost you nothing at all.  In some cases you will find parking is reduced or free (as is the case in some London boroughs to promote EV adoption), and there is also no London Congestion Charge or road tax.  In the US, federal tax incentives range from $2,500 to $7,500 for each EV purchased, but this offer will only last until each manufacturer has produced 200,000 electric vehicles.  Tesla will reach that milestone in 2018, and from there the incentive value will gradually decrease. Unless the system changes, many of the 400,000-plus Model 3 reservations holders will receive no discount at all.  It is also worth remembering these are all measures to try and incentive EV ownership, so once EVs become the norm it is likely that these discounts will be adjusted or abolished.  Some public chargers are free, and so too is Tesla\u2019s Supercharger network providing you own a qualifying car, or bought your car with a referral code from a fellow Tesla owner.  What about hybrids?  Hybrids come in several different configurations. First there is the regular hybrid, like older generations of Toyota Prius, which uses both a petrol engine and small electric motor.  The car charges its battery pack using brake regeneration, and can drive itself solely on battery power for short periods of time.  You may well see Prius drivers set off from traffic lights in silent electric mode, but the engine will kick in when they accelerate more firmly. Hybrids like these cannot be plugged in to charge the battery.  Volvo XC90 T8 plug-in hybrid  Plug-in electric vehicles (PHEV) are becoming increasingly common and act as a half-way house between ICE and full electric.  They can run like a regular hybrid, only topping up the battery when coasting and braking, but can also be plugged in to a public EV charger.  These cars can often cover the daily commute without using their engine, and PHEV technology already appears on a wide range of vehicles, including the VW Golf GTE, Mini Countryman Hybrid and Range Rover P400e.  There\u2019s still an internal combustion engine to maintain, but a nightly charge of the battery means you might not need to use it very often if your commute is short. For example, the Golf GTE and new Range Rover each have an electric range of 31 miles.  Potential lifestyle changes  Living with an EV requires some lifestyle changes. Because public chargers are owned and operated by a number of different companies, you will need to obtain a membership - and often a contactless membership card - for the ones you think you\u2019ll need to use.  It\u2019s a frustrating situation and feels shortsighted - imaging not being able to buy petrol from BP because you only have a membership with Shell - but hopefully this will become simpler as EV adoption spreads.  Next you will need to work out how far your EV can go, and how factors like the temperature affect this. EVs lose charge more quickly in cold weather than in the summer, as the battery takes a longer time to warm up and, just like any lithium battery, is less efficient when the temperature falls.  Kia Soul EV  Manufacturers all provide range claims for their EVs, just like they offer MPG figures with ICE cars - but your mileage will certainly vary. And because EV chargers are less common than petrol stations, you\u2019ll need to put some effort into planning any unfamiliar journeys before setting off.  Also, because chargers are sometimes already in use, or broken, it\u2019s worth having a contingency plan to keep the range anxiety at bay.  Maps of public EV chargers are widely available, and the satellite navigation of some EVs - like the BMW i3 - can guide you to the nearest charger.  Teslas all take into account the company\u2019s Supercharger network whenever you use the sat-nav to get somewhere, and take charge time into account when working out your estimated time of arrival.  For now, owning an EV is only really possible if you have off-street parking at home and space to install a charger. This means those who live in town and city centers - and residents in apartment blocks - will likely be out of luck, unless you are happy to always use public chargers, or perhaps your office has one you can use.  In short, owning an EV requires more journey planning, and those journeys will take longer than with an ICE car when charging en route is required. But these drawbacks are slowly being eradicated, and will continue to fade as EV adoption grows.  Once home chargers are more widely installed - and chargers are included in the car park of new apartment blocks - charging your car at night will become as instinctive as plugging in your phone.", "stock": "TSLA"}, {"url": "http://www.techradar.com/news/nvidia-turing-next-gen-graphics-cards-could-be-revealed-next-month", "label": 1, "source": "techradar", "date": "2018-02-14", "article": "Up until now, we\u2019ve been expecting Volta to be the name of Nvidia\u2019s next generation graphics cards, but the 11-series might be named after another famous physicist.

Residential solar had been on a tear, averaging 49% annual growth between 2010 and 2016, but the number of megawatts added last year dropped by 16% compared with the year before, according to new data from GTM Research, a firm that tracks renewable energy. It was the first annual decline since at least 2000, which is as far back as GTM tracks figures.  Industry executives and energy experts said the slowdown was driven by a sharp retreat by national solar installers, including Tesla\u2019s SolarCity and Vivint Solar Inc. VSLR -2.44% Those big outfits had deployed large sales forces to pitch homeowners on the benefits of rooftop solar, and heavily marketed deals to lease panels that required little to no money down.  The race to build a dominant national solar brand led companies to burn through cash. Unable to maintain that pace, companies scaled back and focused on profits over growth, or in some cases, got out of the rooftop solar business altogether.  SolarCity, purchased by Tesla in 2016, posted the largest declines. Once the clear-cut leader among solar installers, with one-third of the national market two years ago, it ended door-to-door sales last year and cut customer-acquisition spending. Its sales, as measured by megawatts deployed, fell by 38% in 2017, according to company figures, which include both residential and commercial installations.  Tesla said it was moving away from no-money-down leases and toward sales. It appears to have been passed by rival Sunrun Inc. RUN 0.35% in recent months as the top solar installer in the country, according to GTM.  \u201cWe expect growth to resume later this year,\u201d Tesla said last month.  Other companies also retreated from heavily marketing their home solar businesses, including NRG Energy Inc., NRG 0.37% which shut its business last year, and Vivint, which posted a 17% drop in residential sales volume in 2017 as it moved to prioritize profitability. Sungevity Inc. filed for bankruptcy protection last year after an aggressive growth strategy resulted in too much debt, the company said in a court filing.  The industry\u2019s sales strategies have attracted scrutiny by regulators in some states, including New Mexico, where the state attorney general, Hector Balderas, filed a lawsuit last month claiming that Vivint used \u201cfalse, misleading and fraudulent statements\u201d to sign customers up for long-term deals.  Rob Kain, Vivint\u2019s vice president of investor relations, said the company disagrees with the allegations and plans to contest them in court.  \u201cCould we have had a salesperson who was aggressive? I wouldn\u2019t be surprised,\u201d Mr. Kain said, adding that the company would have fired a salesperson for misrepresentations.  SolarCity grew with help from a hard-charging sales culture. Before being acquired by Tesla, the company, which was run by Lyndon Rive, the cousin of Tesla founder Elon Musk, tapped salespeople from the mortgage industry and Las Vegas casinos to sell solar panels, and gave them aggressive quotas, according to current and former managers and employees interviewed by The Wall Street Journal.  Last year, Tesla changed course and began selling solar panels through the same stores that sell its cars. Other sales approaches were shut down in order to \u201cfocus on projects with better margins,\u201d the company said.  Eric White, president and chief executive of Dividend Finance , a San Francisco-based company that provides loans to homeowners putting solar on their roofs, said many solar companies acted too much like Silicon Valley firms, pursuing growth at all costs in hopes of becoming leaders in a nascent market.  Mr. White said that while the industry\u2019s prior growth is \u201cnot sustainable and leaves bodies in its tracks,\u201d 5%-to-15% annual increases are achievable.  Solar energy grew rapidly in recent years as the cost of solar panels declined. The all-in cost of a typical rooftop solar system fell by 61% between 2010 and 2017 to $2.80 per watt, or roughly $16,000 for the average home system, according to the federal government.  Solar executives and industry analysts believe annual residential solar growth will resume in 2018. But two developments risk hurting sales in coming years, say industry analysts. First, new Trump administration tariffs on imported solar modules, mostly from China, are expected to marginally raise costs. Second, a federal government tax incentive to homeowners worth 30% of the value of the solar array is set to end by 2021.  Lynn Jurich, chief executive of Sunrun, said rising utility electricity rates and falling solar panel costs will drive increased interest in solar.  \u201cWe saw an unnaturally high growth rate because there was a lot of capital coming in to spend on advertising and customer origination, and not a lot of discipline on focusing on profitable growth,\u201d she said of the sector as a whole. \u201cYou suck all the advertising out of an industry and it shrinks.\u201d  Still, companies continue to spend considerable amounts acquiring customers. Sunrun estimates it spends about 28 cents on marketing for every dollar spent on purchasing and installing panels.  Sophie Karp, an analyst at Guggenheim Securities, said industrywide customer-acquisition costs were higher.  \u201cSolar is not a product that you buy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a product that gets sold.\u201d  \u2014Kirsten Grind contributed to this article.

The iOS 11.3 update for phones and tablets also includes a toggle to disable a controversial feature that slowed down iPhones with older batteries to avoid random shutdowns. It also offers the ability to view health records, and new animated emojis for iPhone X users.  While Apple first previewed the software changes in January, the new privacy features come as Facebook faces criticism over unauthorized use of its customers\u2019 data. Users, regulators and investors are raising more questions about what large technology companies know about their customers.  Apple regularly promotes the privacy of its devices. It makes money by selling hardware, while internet companies like Facebook and Google rely on detailed user data for their advertising businesses.  Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook called for user privacy regulation at a recent summit in China.  \u201cThis certain situation is so dire and has become so large that probably some well-crafted regulation is necessary,\u201d Cook said after being asked if the use of data should be restricted in light of the Facebook incident. \u201cThe ability of anyone to know what you\u2019ve been browsing about for years, who your contacts are, who their contacts are, things you like and dislike and every intimate detail of your life -- from my own point of view it shouldn\u2019t exist.\u201d  Apple\u2019s new web-based privacy options will be released for users in Europe in early May, while the features will come to other countries later. Previously, users could download their data, correct their information, and delete accounts by contacting Apple directly. This is the first time the company is offering these capabilities in a single location online.  The web page will let users download data stored across individual apps and services. For instance, they will be able to download all information stored in Apple\u2019s Contacts, Calendar and Contacts apps and media like photos, but also preferences like songs they stream via Apple Music.", "stock": "AAPL"}, {"url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-18/the-link-between-ball-bearings-and-zettabytes-of-data-minebea", "label": -1, "source": "bloomberg", "date": "2018-02-19", "article": "There\u2019s a good chance your Instagram photos are making money for Japanese ball-bearings manufacturer Minebea Mitsumi Inc.  The Tokyo-based company, which counts Apple Inc. as one of its main customers, makes various components used in data centers. That includes ball bearings in hard drives and cooling fans, which are in high demand as the world generates, processes and stores more information. As everything from refrigerators to self-driving cars throw off information that needs to be uploaded to the cloud, data centers will be housing 1.3 zettabytes (1.3 trillion gigabytes) by 2021, more than double from this year, according to Cisco Systems Inc..  That\u2019s helped Minebea, which this month lifted its earnings outlook for the third straight quarter on strong sales of data center-related parts. Valued at almost $10 billion, Minebea is also benefiting from the success of Nintendo Co.\u2019s Switch console, which is assembled by Mitsumi, a unit acquired last year. The company\u2019s stock doubled in 2017.  Bloomberg News sat down with Chief Financial Officer Hiromi Yoda to talk about earnings growth, Nintendo, and what the zettabyte era means for his company.  How is business?  The demand for ball bearings is very strong and we\u2019re increasingly eating through our inventory. Demand from data centers in particular is very strong. We\u2019re quite surprised by growth of fan motors for cooling data centers. It\u2019s not enough to have one data center, but you need backups. And then a backup for your backup. The data you see on Instagram and other services, that keeps increasing. People aren\u2019t deleting their photos. And we\u2019re very thankful for that.  Are you planning more investment?  We still have capacity to increase by 15 million bearings annually by using space in existing factories in Thailand, which will bring capacity to 300 million by May or June. But it is becoming necessary to invest in new factories. We\u2019re considering possible locations.  How much would you be willing to spend?  We\u2019ve already invested 8 billion yen in expanding capacity, but that was within existing locations. To build infrastructure for a brand-new factory requires a number that has an extra digit. That\u2019s why we have to consider it very seriously.  Will we see profits revised higher again?  I can\u2019t speak about short-term earnings, but when we laid out our medium-term plan last May we expected operating profit to reach 100 billion yen by March 2021. It\u2019s beginning to look like we can arrive at that number a year early.  What\u2019s the outlook for the game-console assembly business?  Our customer is doing very well. We won\u2019t know next fiscal year\u2019s numbers until March. But we\u2019re not a supplier, we\u2019re an assembler. We can deal with bigger demand and won\u2019t need additional investment.  How is the merger with Mitsumi going?  The increase in efficiency is going faster than expected. The business is doing better as our customer is selling more units, but also because of our improved profitability.  You supply LCD backlights to Apple. How is that business doing?  We\u2019re actually doing better than expected. People make a big deal about how great OLED is, but it\u2019s hard to see the screen in daylight. And if you put three OLED screens next to each other, they\u2019ll all show slightly different colors.

Apple said the base expanded 30 percent from two years ago to 1.3 billion.  That increase should have been seen as positive because Apple aims to become less dependent on selling iPhones and shift to selling its existing customers services like Apple Music or add-on devices like the Apple Watch or AirPods.  But analysts voiced skepticism. Apple's best-selling product, the iPhone, has seen relatively flat unit sales over the same two-year period. On Apple's earnings conference call, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said that the combination of trends implies users are hanging on to their devices longer, and he asked Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook whether investors should be worried about that.  Cook responded that it was up to investors to decide what to focus on, but said he was comfortable with customers buying used iPhones.  When customers sell their old iPhone for a new one, the old iPhone \"winds up with another customer somewhere else that is perfectly fine with having a previously owned iPhone. And so I view all of that to be incredibly positive. It's more people on iPhones, the better,\" Cook said.  Laura Martin of Needham & Co pressed Cook on whether the larger device base meant more devices per user, or more users - an important question, because a user with both an iPad and iPhone is likely to only purchase one Apple Music subscription, for example.  Cook said \"there are many, many, many more\" Apple users than two years ago but declined to give an actual figure.  The signals on how well Apple is monetizing users were mixed. Sales of its \"wearable\" accessories - Beats headphones, AirPods and the Apple Watch - were up 70 percent year-over-year in the fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 30. But services revenue - which includes Apple Music, iCloud and the App Store - fell short of analysts' expectations for the December quarter, at $8.4 billion, and was down slightly from the previous quarter.  Apple has yet to disclose plans for how it will distribute the television shows in which it has been investing in recent months, which could become a large business.  \"They've been building up the services business for several years, knowing full well that at some point the gravy train on smart phones is going to end,\" said Bob O'Donnell, head of Technalysis Research.

Major technology companies are battling for dominance in U.S. schools, a market seen as important for hooking young consumers.  Apple in March 2017 lowered the price of its 9.7-inch tablet to $329, the lowest starting price ever for one of its full-sized tablets. But laptops running operating systems by Alphabet Inc's Google or Microsoft Corp can be had for less than $200.  Apple's previous price cutting, along with software changes, have been followed by an improvement in iPad sales. Analysts believe the teacher- and student-geared event on Tuesday at Lane Tech College Prep High School will include an update to its iPad lineup, including possibly a lower-priced model.  Apple made up just 17 percent of the K-12 U.S. educational market in the third quarter, according to data from Futuresource Consulting. Meanwhile 60 percent of mobile computing shipments to schools ran Google's Chrome operating system, and 22 percent had Windows.  Chromebooks sold by Dell Technologies Inc can be had for as little as $189. Microsoft last year introduced an education-focused laptop from partner Lenovo Group Ltd running Window 10 S.  Apple in recent years made changes to its operating system so that more than one student can log into an iPad, and to its software to let teachers better manage groups of students.  But it faces a tough battle in the educational market given the popularity of Google and Microsoft's cloud-based productivity suites, said Carolina Milanesi of Creative Strategies. Google's G Suite fueled Chromebook sales because it was seen as easy to use to manage assignments.  \"Most teachers don't look past G Suite for education,\" she said. Apple has iWork, which added features in recent years but remains less familiar to teachers than Google's productivity suite or Microsoft's Office.  Education sales for iPads rose 32 percent to more than 1 million units in Apple's fiscal third quarter. Sales of iPads made up just 8.3 percent of Apple's $229.2 billion total revenue last year, however, compared with the nearly 62 percent of sales generated by iPhones.  Apple needs to keep working to regain market share in schools to get children interested in its devices later on, said TECHnalysis Research founder Bob O'Donnell.  \"It's more about the psychology of driving long-term preference for the (Apple) platform. It's more strategic than financial,\" he said.

I joined a round-table discussion with Apple SVPs and a handful of reporters to get the skinny on what was taking so long.  The answer, it turns out, was that Apple had decided to start completely over with the Mac Pro, introduce completely new pro products like the iMac Pro and refresh the entire MacBook Pro lineup. The reasoning given at the time on the Mac Pro was basically that Apple had painted itself into an architecture corner by being aggressively original on the design of the bullet/turbine/trash-can shaped casing and internal components of the current Mac Pro. There was nothing to be done but start over.  The secondary objective to that visit was to reassure pro customers who had not had news of updates in some time that Apple was listening, was working to deliver products for them and generally still cared.  Now, one year later, I was invited back to Apple to talk to the people most responsible for shepherding the renewed pro product strategy. John Ternus, vice president of Hardware Engineering, Tom Boger, senior director of Mac Hardware Product Marketing, Jud Coplan, director of Video Apps Product Marketing and Xander Soren, director of Music Apps Product Marketing.  The interviews and demos took place over several hours, highlighting the way that Apple is approaching upgradability, development of its pro apps and, most interestingly, how it has changed its process to help it more fully grok how professionals actually use its products.  After an initial recap in what they\u2019d done over the past year, including MacBooks and the iMac Pro, I was given the day\u2019s first piece of news: the long-awaited Mac Pro update will not arrive before 2019.  When we got the news that it wouldn\u2019t arrive in 2017, there was some implicit messaging that 2018 was not guaranteed either (we were told \u201cnot this year,\u201d but not \u201cdefinitely next year\u201d). This time around, Boger was succinct: the promised Mac Pro will be a 2019 product.  \u201cWe want to be transparent and communicate openly with our pro community, so we want them to know that the Mac Pro is a 2019 product. It\u2019s not something for this year.\u201d In addition to transparency for pro customers, there\u2019s also a larger fiscal reason behind it.  \u201cWe know that there\u2019s a lot of customers today that are making purchase decisions on the iMac Pro and whether or not they should wait for the Mac Pro,\u201d says Boger.  This is why Apple wants to be as explicit as possible now, so that if institutional buyers or other large customers are waiting to spend budget on, say iMac Pros or other machines, they should pull the trigger without worry that a Mac Pro might appear late in the purchasing year.  But there have been some other very interesting things going on at Apple since our last Mac Pro update, and they\u2019re shaping the future of all of its pro products.  Pro Workflow Team  In that discussion a year ago, Apple SVP Phil Schiller acknowledged that pro customers, including developers, were hungry for evidence that Apple was paying attention to their needs.  \u201cWe recognize that they want to hear more from us. And so we want to communicate better with them. We want them to understand the importance they have for us, we want them to understand that we\u2019re investing in new Macs \u2014 not only new MacBook Pros and iMacs but Mac Pros for them, we want them to know we are going to work on a display for a modular system,\u201d Schiller said.  Now, it\u2019s a year later and Apple has created a team inside the building that houses its pro products group. It\u2019s called the Pro Workflow Team, and they haven\u2019t talked about it publicly before today. The group is under John Ternus and works closely with the engineering organization. The bays that I\u2019m taken to later to chat about Final Cut Pro, for instance, are a few doors away from the engineers tasked with making it run great on Apple hardware.  \u201cWe said in the meeting last year that the pro community isn\u2019t one thing,\u201d says Ternus. \u201cIt\u2019s very diverse. There\u2019s many different types of pros and obviously they go really deep into the hardware and software and are pushing everything to its limit. So one thing you have to do is we need to be engaging with the customers to really understand their needs. Because we want to provide complete pro solutions, not just deliver big hardware, which we\u2019re doing and we did it with iMac Pro. But look at everything holistically.\u201d  To do that, Ternus says, they want their architects sitting with real customers to understand their actual flow and to see what they\u2019re doing in real time. The challenge with that, unfortunately, is that though customers are typically very responsive when Apple comes calling, it\u2019s not always easy to get what they want because they may be using proprietary content. John Powell, for instance, is a long-time logic user and he\u2019s doing the new Star Wars Han Solo standalone flick. As you can imagine, taking those unreleased and highly secret compositions to Apple to play with on their machines can be a sticking point.  So Apple decided to go a step further and just begin hiring these creatives directly into Apple. Some of them on a contract basis but many full-time, as well. These are award-winning artists and technicians that are brought in to shoot real projects (I saw a bunch of them walking by in Apple Park toting kit for an on-premise outdoor shoot). They then put the hardware and software through their paces and point out sticking points that could cause frustration and friction among pro users.  Ternus says that they wanted to start focused, then grow the team and disciplines over time.  \u201cWe\u2019ve been focusing on visual effects and video editing and 3D animation and music production, as well,\u201d says Ternus. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve brought in some pretty incredible talent, really masters of their craft. And so they\u2019re now sitting and building out workflows internally with real content and really looking for what are the bottlenecks. What are the pain points. How can we improve things. And then we take this information where we find it and we go into our architecture team and our performance architects and really drill down and figure out where is the bottleneck. Is it the OS, is it in the drivers, is it in the application, is it in the silicon, and then run it to ground to get it fixed.\u201d  This information has allowed Apple to make machines like the iMac Pro more performant, but also to enable creative users to stay in their flow and keep them moving forward. From personal experience, I can say that the times I felt most frustrated as a professional photographer using a Mac are when I had to wait. When you\u2019re taken out of your rhythm, it creates layers of frustration that can add up to you wanting to flee the platform.  \u201cThese aren\u2019t necessarily always fundamental performance issues,\u201d notes Ternus. \u201cThese aren\u2019t things that you\u2019d find in a benchmark or an automated test flow. You know we have examples where we find something\u2026 like it\u2019s a window that a 3D animator uses frequently to make some fine tweaks. The windows are not super graphically intensive in terms of processing and stewing but we have found an issue where that window was taking like 6 to 10 seconds to open and they\u2019re doing that 100 times a day, right? Like \u2018I can\u2019t work on a machine like this, it\u2019s too slow,\u2019 so we dig in and we figure out what it was.  \u201cIn that case we found something in the graphics driver was not right, and once you know where to look and you fix it, it completely changes the kind of live-on-ability for that system \u2014 the productivity for that user completely changed.\u201d  This kind of workflow analysis has enabled Apple to find and fix problems that won\u2019t be solved by throwing more hardware at them. An in-depth analysis of how workflow is affected by the whole stack of hardware and software has, Ternus says, helped them to really understand the pain points. He stresses that it\u2019s not just Apple\u2019s applications that they\u2019re testing and working to help make better. Third-party relationships on this are very important to them and the workflow team is helping to fix their problems faster too.  \u201cWe\u2019ve gone from just, you know, engineering Macs and software to actually engineering a workflow and really understanding from soup to nuts, every single stage of the process, where those bottlenecks are, where we can optimize that,\u201d says Boger. \u201cAnd to JT\u2019s point, because we build the hardware, the firmware, the operating system, the software, and have these close relationships with third parties, we can attack the entire stack and we can really ferret out where we are \u2014 we can optimize for performance.\u201d  But the Pro Workflow Team isn\u2019t just there to fix current bugs. It\u2019s also empowered to make improvements on future products, like the Mac Pro.  Future plans  \u201cWhat\u2019s really powerful through this exercise is that it\u2019s helping us to kind of map out where we\u2019re headed,\u201d says Ternus. \u201cBecause we\u2019re really digging in these workflows and figuring out how are the ways we can improve these in the future, and then that can help shape our future plans, as well.\u201d  I ask, specifically, whether this means that the Mac Pro will be shaped by this team\u2019s work.  \u201cSo it\u2019s definitely influencing the architecture of where we\u2019re going, what we\u2019re planning for,\u201d says Tom Boger. \u201cWe\u2019re getting a much deeper understanding of our pro customers and their workflows and really understanding not only where the state of the art is today but where the state of the art is going, and all of that is really informing the work that we\u2019re doing on the Mac Pro and we\u2019re working really hard on it.\u201d  I\u2019m also curious about whether the process over the last year has changed the timeline on the Mac Pro. To be blunt: Is this the original story arc of the Mac Pro\u2019s development, or are we looking at a roadmap that has a fundamentally different timeline than one year ago.  \u201cI don\u2019t think that the timeline has fundamentally changed,\u201d says Ternus. \u201cI think this is very much a situation where we want to measure twice and cut once, and we want to make sure we\u2019re building a really well thought-out platform for what our pro customers are doing today. But also with an eye towards what they\u2019re going to be doing in the future, as well. And so to do that right, that\u2019s what we\u2019re focusing on.\u201d  While there are no further details on the exact shape that the Mac Pro will take, Boger says they are still very much in the modular mindset.  \u201cAs we said a year ago, working on modular was inherently a modular system and in looking at our customers and their workflows obviously that\u2019s a real need for our customers and that\u2019s the direction we\u2019re going,\u201d says Boger.  \u201cWell, it\u2019s a need for some of them,\u201d adds Ternus. \u201cI want to be clear that the work that we\u2019re doing as a part of the workflow team is across everything. It\u2019s super relevant for MacBook Pros, it\u2019s super relevant for iMacs and iMac Pros and in the end I think it helps us in dialogue with customers to figure out what are the right systems for you. There is absolutely a need in certain places for modularity. But it\u2019s also really clear that the iMac form factor or the MacBook Pros can be exceptionally good tools.\u201d  What shape that modularity takes is another matter entirely, of course. I know some people have been pining for the days of internal expansion card configurations with standardized hardware \u2014 and maybe that is the way that this will go. But on Tuesday I also got a tour of the editing suites where Mac hardware and software is pushed to the limits, including extensive use of eGPU support, and a different vision emerges.  First, we visit the room where they record new instruments for Logic and Garage Band and then on to an edit bay used by the Pro Workflow Team to put Final Cut Pro through its paces.  Throughout, the idea of modularity was omnipresent. An iMac Pro with two iPad Pros hooked up to it allows for direct control, shortcuts and live access to the Logic manual, all while you\u2019re mixing a song on the main device: an eGPU with a MacBook Pro running a live edit of an 8K stream with color grading and effects applied.  External GPUs plugged into MacBook Pros, in my opinion, is going to be an enormous shift in the way that people think about portables. I got a live demo of a graphics stress test running on a MacBook Pro natively, then on one and then two external GPUs. The switching is nearly seamless, depending on the age of the app, and some modern rendering software can use all three in concert. It\u2019s one of those things that works exactly the way you think it would, and it leans heavily on Thunderbolt 3.  Whether that informs the shape of individual machines in Apple\u2019s future lineup I don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s certainly the way Apple is looking at the pro ecosystem. It\u2019s not just MacBook Pro, iMac Pro, Mac Pro \u2014 it\u2019s the enabling force of eGPUs, it\u2019s iPad Pros as input devices, purpose-built extensions and portable workstations. And it\u2019s even iPhone, as Logic and Final Cut Pro are both completely compatible with GarageBand and iMovie. You can start a project and continue it on iOS while traveling, then put it right back into your pro machine when you\u2019re back and continue riffing. It\u2019s Apple leaning into its advantages of having control of this stuff to the bolts.  Prommunication  With pros, Apple has three options. It can maintain the same amount of locked-down, tight-lipped comms it applies to its consumer products, where it still feels the reveal is everything.  It can utilize a \u201cwhisper campaign\u201d of on-background commentary, quiet liaisons with the developer and professional communities that filter outward in order to quell rumors or allay fears.  Or, it can choose to engage in a meaningful way with pros on their actual workflows and ingest their pain points as actionable intel that helps them head off issues before they become headlines or Medium posts or viral Twitter threads. That\u2019s what the Pro Workflow Team is all about.  One allegory I see here is when companies hire people to help fix structural problems or improve diversity, but then do not empower them to effect change.  In this case it\u2019s heartening to see that there is a straight line between the pros that Apple has hired, the conversations it\u2019s having with contractors who come in to contribute and proactive action taken on products. The work of the Pro Workflow Team is directly affecting the development of the new Mac Pro. And the iMac Pro, Final Cut Pro and macOS. They sit doors away from the engineering team running through real footage and mixing real tracks to figure out what\u2019s working and what\u2019s not. And they use a mixture of software, not just Apple\u2019s first-party stuff.  This also includes liaising with external mainstays like Adobe to figure out what their major pain points are and figuring out ways to fix them.  This isn\u2019t the expected culture of covert insularity in which Apple waits for the complaints to hit critical mass or someone to take it up as a cause before it\u2019s addressed. Frankly, a developer shouldn\u2019t have to complain to someone like me to get a company like Apple to change its mind. They should have their own representatives.  And Apple can still have its reveal. All we currently know about the Mac Pro is that it\u2019s modular and that it\u2019s being shaped by the feedback from those pros in-house, as well as external conversations with developers and professional users.  My recent conversations with Apple (including the ones cited in this piece, but not those alone) lead me to believe that they know they kept going on a path with pro customers that they felt was working long after it had, in fact, begun to erode. I\u2019m not exactly sure what the timeline was, but given the fact that the Mac Pro won\u2019t arrive until 2019, I\u2019m guessing just before the round-table discussion a year ago.  As a side note, by the way, I wouldn\u2019t expect to see any more info about Mac Pro at WWDC in June. Maybe Apple will surprise on that front, but I think for anything further about Mac Pro we\u2019re going to have to wait for next year.  In an interesting confluence of themes, I also believe that they had the same revelation recently in the education market. Apple\u2019s second go-round at capturing a big chunk of that market ran aground not on the quality of its hardware or onboard software, but on the tools that were used to deploy and manage that hardware in under-resourced school districts that had already begun to commit to web systems. Apple is starting anew there, as it has begun doing in the pro market over the last year with refreshed hardware and a new approach to addressing performance and operation issues. An interesting note, too, that when it wanted to figure out how to turn the education market around what did it do? Hired teachers and educators to tell them how it works in the real world.  As depressing as it has been to see professionals believe that Apple was getting ready to give them up, I find this an interesting and exciting thing to watch. It is very, very hard for a company like Apple \u2014 whose reputation is built on myth building \u2014 to admit that it was mistaken. And it\u2019s even harder to then change course with billions of dollars\u2019 worth of revenue at stake.  I\u2019m sure it gives a bunch of people at Apple heartburn, but it\u2019s fascinating for me because I don\u2019t have to pull it off.", "stock": "AAPL"}, {"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/02/22/apple-said-to-debut-voice-activated-siri-airpods-in-2018-water-resistant-model-in-2019/", "label": 1, "source": "techcrunch", "date": "2018-02-22", "article": "Apple is preparing a couple of updating models of AirPods, according to Bloomberg. The popular fully wireless earbud-style headphones that Apple introduced last year are currently on track for a refresh in 2018 with the addition of a new version of the \u201cW\u201d line of chips that Apple created specifically to manage and improve Bluetooth-based connections between gadgets.  The 2018 hardware refresh would include not only an improved W chip (possibly the W2 added to the Apple Watch last year, or perhaps even a W3) but also the ability to activate Siri just by voice, rather than by physically tapping the AirPod in your ear, as is the case currently.  Like with Amazon\u2019s Echo devices or the iPhone, a user would be able to trigger the virtual assistant simply by saying the wake word aloud \u2013 \u201cHey Siri,\u201d in this case. That would indeed to a step-up in terms of shifting AirPods to a voice-first interface device.

And the company unveiled a brand new device \u2014 well, sort of. Apple is going to sell a brand new 9.7-inch iPad that works with the Apple Pencil.  Before today, only (more expensive) iPad Pro models could take advantage of the Pencil. Today\u2019s new iPad will cost $329 for regular consumers. Schools can buy it for $299, just like the previous 9.7-inch iPad.  Based on the introduction video, it looks and works just like the existing 9.7-inch iPad. The bezels are identical and there\u2019s a Touch ID sensor. Apple Pencil support is the only thing that seems new so far on the hardware front.  Existing iPad users will also get new features as Pages, Numbers and Keynote for iOS are all going to be updated to support the Apple Pencil. It\u2019s surprising that those Apple apps haven\u2019t supported the stylus yet, but now it\u2019s possible.  This feature is going to be called Smart Annotation and is going to be available as a beta. Teachers could use it to grade papers for instance.  Apple showed some tech specs. This new iPad should have an LTE version, an 8MP camera, all the sensors you\u2019d expect in an iPad and an A10 Fusion chip. This chip first appeared in the iPhone 7. This sounds like a nice upgrade from last year\u2019s iPad but not a true departure from this product line.  Apple also said that there are 200,000 education apps in the App Store right now. The company is trying to position the iPad as a more capable device against Google Chromebooks. And in order to attract schools, Apple is offering 200GB per iCloud account instead of 5GB of free storage.

Apple already designs a lot of custom silicon, including its chipsets like the W-series for its Bluetooth headphones, the S-series in its watches, its A-series iPhone chips, as well as customized GPU for the new iPhones. In that sense, Apple has in a lot of ways built its own internal fabless chip firm, which makes sense as it looks for its devices to tackle more and more specific use cases and remove some of its reliance on third parties for their equipment. Apple is already in the middle of in a very public spat with Qualcomm over royalties, and while the Mac is sort of a tertiary product in its lineup, it still contributes a significant portion of revenue to the company.  Creating an entire suite of custom silicon could do a lot of things for Apple, the least of which bringing in the Mac into a system where the devices can talk to each other more efficiently. Apple already has a lot of tools to shift user activities between all its devices, but making that more seamless means it\u2019s easier to lock users into the Apple ecosystem. If you\u2019ve ever compared connecting headphones with a W1 chip to the iPhone and just typical Bluetooth headphones, you\u2019ve probably seen the difference, and that could be even more robust with its own chipset. Bloomberg reports that Apple may implement the chips as soon as 2020.  Intel may be the clear loser here, and the market is reflecting that. Intel\u2019s stock is down nearly 8% after the report came out, as it would be a clear shift away from the company\u2019s typical architecture where it has long held its ground as Apple moves on from traditional silicon to its own custom designs. Apple, too, is not the only company looking to design its own silicon, with Amazon looking into building its own AI chips for Alexa in another move to create a lock-in for the Amazon ecosystem. And while the biggest players are looking at their own architecture, there\u2019s an entire suite of startups getting a lot of funding building custom silicon geared toward AI.

Yesterday, reports emerged that Apple was working on a pair of follow-ups to its Airpods headphones that could bring them always-on Siri functionality as well as a splash-proof design. As we think about all the things that Apple could do right with its next set of wireless earbuds, it\u2019s easy to reflect on all that Google did wrong with its Pixel Buds and how much of an opportunity they still have.  Google Assistant lends so much potential to a pair of smart wireless earbuds from Google. The fact is that Siri doesn\u2019t hold a candle to Google Assistant in many ways, and while the functionality of voice control on the AirPods is largely focused on music and calls, the superior intelligence of Google Assistant should make them a much clearer companion for a set of earbuds.  Hardware is still very much a side project for Google, but as the company prioritizes home assistant hardware, it really doesn\u2019t make sense that they\u2019re not putting more resources into a pair of wireless headphones. The Pixel Buds need a more purposeful design that minimizes friction and delivers Assistant insights more effortlessly in a package that feels like more than just a follow-on.  The AirPods are an engineering marvel, and while some of the functionality of the Pixel Buds was interesting \u2014 mainly their ability to interface with the Pixel 2 for language translation \u2014 they fell flat on design. Google needs to rethink its wireless earbuds from the ground-up and focus more on creating something with the sleekness of the Pixel phones rather than the fabric-obsessed friendliness of their Home devices. Cutting the woven cord and moving to a truly wireless form factor is a necessary step, as is shrinking down the size of the Bud part of the product. It\u2019s really not about the sound quality as much as it is about the connectivity and the lack of friction. While FastPair has been a great step in simplifying the bluetooth pairing, there are still some quirks that aren\u2019t present with Apple\u2019s W1 chip.  While Siri is always quick to refer you to search results when it doesn\u2019t have an answer (a frequent occurrence), Assistant\u2019s optimization for its display-free Home devices has led it to order functionality around the assumption that there\u2019s not always a screen available to default to. Today, Google announced that it was bringing location-based notifications and voice-optimized routine functionality to its Home devices so it could complete regular custom tasks without you having to pepper it with commands, stuff like this would be ideal for earbuds that are always-listening, something that Google could do much more with than Apple.  Even as features take months to roll out, Google has still shown a degree of nimbleness on the voice assistant front that Apple can\u2019t match in annual WWDC keynotes. While Amazon is just as quick with Alexa, Google Assistant\u2019s deepening integration with Android establishes an arena where they should be the clear champion.  AirPods are clearly the best wireless earbud that an Apple user can own and even with the reduced functionality that still might be true of Android phones. People are building tools to bring iOS-only feature sets to Android and that fact alone should suggest Google take a more serious look at its own hardware and the opportunity that it\u2019s losing out on.", "stock": "AAPL"}, {"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/03/12/apple-maps-shows-you-the-nearest-bike-sharing-stations/", "label": -1, "source": "techcrunch", "date": "2018-03-12", "article": "Apple has signed a partnership with Ito World to add bike-sharing data in Apple Maps in over 175 cities across 36 countries. The feature is now live and helps you find the nearest station by typing \u201cbike sharing\u201d in the search bar or the name of the service.  Once again, Apple chose to integrate an existing data set instead of putting together this data in-house. Ito World has worked with dozens of companies to license and normalize bike-sharing data. This way, Apple only has to integrate one data model to support hundreds of bike-sharing services.  Apple isn\u2019t starting from zero as the company had already integrated some bike-sharing data in a handful of cities. But this is a big improvement over existing data.  Apple Maps doesn\u2019t tell you the number of available bikes or empty docks. I hope the company is going to add this in an upcoming update. It just gives you the address, name and contact information for the service, so this feature won\u2019t replace more sophisticated apps for local users.  But it can be quite useful if you\u2019re traveling to another city and you want to ride a bike. As the name of the service is different in each city, you often end up on Google looking for local bike-sharing services.  With this update, you can type \u201cbike sharing\u201d in any city and find the name of the service and the location of the closest station. It doesn\u2019t tell you if a startup is operating a dock-less bike-sharing service in that city. So you\u2019ll have to open the Mobike, Ofo or oBike app yourself.  Apple Maps supports Citi Bike in NYC, Ford GoBike in San Francisco, BIKETOWN in Portland, Santander Cycles in London, bicing in Barcelona, BIXI in Montreal, CityCycle in Brisbane, nextbike in Germany, Austria, Croatia, Switzerland, the U.K., and dozens of others. I tried looking for stations in smaller cities and it also works in European cities with hundreds of thousands of people.  Apple has been slowly adding more data to Apple Maps to stay relevant against Google Maps. The app now supports airport and mall maps, lane guidance, public transit, EV charging stations and more.

Photo  A reality check on the White House\u2019s tariff tactics  Investors last week looked at President Trump\u2019s tariffs against Chinese products and seemed to conclude that he was taking the U.S. into a trade war with China. The stock market plunged 6 percent.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Perhaps eager to stop the rout, the White House on Monday had a less confrontational message: Mr. Trump is applying one of his negotiating tactics. According to this view, the tariff proposal was a jarring move partly aimed at getting China to see that the U.S. was serious about wanting to make trade with China fairer.  From a CNBC interview with Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers:  \u201cFrom the beginning, all the way back to last summer when I arrived at the White House, the president has been clear that he wants to set a marker down with some big asks at the beginning, he doesn\u2019t want to dribble them out, and then he wants his negotiators to try to fix the trade problems. ...Hopefully, it all works out with negotiation.\u201d  Mr. Hassett\u2019s comments were in response to a WSJ article reporting that China and the U.S. were quietly engaged in trade negotiations.  Investors seemed somewhat relieved: The stock market was up 1.5 percent on Monday. Of course, if the stakes are small enough, a deal may get done in the coming months that allows both sides to claim victory. But it seems unlikely that China would quickly agree to a far-reaching overhaul of the rules that govern foreign investment in the country, a major area of dispute. Our colleagues Raymond Zhong and Paul Mozur showed the depth of the divide there.  Mr. Trump could up the ante if China shows no real signs that it will open up considerably. That could roil the markets again. The White House may want to signal that it can take market turmoil in stride. Mr. Hassett on Monday seemed to say that the White House expects market sell-offs as it pursues its trade agenda.  \u201cIf you start from a world where a bunch your intellectual technology is being stolen, then of course it\u2019s going to increase risk premiums in the short run when you try to do something about it, but in the end it should be a positive for us if we can get them to just stop them disregarding the rules of international order.\u201d  (Rising risk premiums means investors require a better return on their stocks and bonds to cover higher risks. This usually involves a decline in price to make their returns look better to prospective buyers.)  Still, the more conciliatory tone from the White House after the sell-off suggests there is not a strong desire for a full-on trade war.  \u2014 Peter Eavis  Shares of Facebook continue to slide.  The stock is down 6.5 percent Monday morning as the Federal Trade Commission confirmed that it has opened an investigation into Facebook\u2019s privacy practice.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Also on Monday, Senator Chuck Grassley, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, invited Mr. Zuckerberg to testify about privacy standards next month and also extended the invitation to Google\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, and Twitter\u2019s chief executive, Jack Dorsey.  Facebook\u2019s shares are down nearly 22 percent since its high in early February and off more than 18 percent since the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke more than a week ago.  To put Facebook\u2019s recent tumble in perspective: The stock is set for its worst monthly performance since August 2012. Over the past 10 days, Facebook has lost $100 billion in market value.  Despite the fall, Wall Street has not soured on Facebook. Forty-four analysts have buy ratings on the stock, compare to just two who have sell ratings, according to Bloomberg.  Photo  Tim Cook thinks regulation of Facebook is inevitable  The Apple C.E.O. said at the China Development Forum in Beijing that the government should tighten privacy regulations, after last week\u2019s revelations about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica:  \u201cI think that this certain situation is so dire and has become so large that probably some well-crafted regulation is necessary. The ability of anyone to know what you\u2019ve been browsing about for years, who your contacts are, who their contacts are, things you like and dislike and every intimate detail of your life \u2014 from my own point of view, it shouldn\u2019t exist.\u201d  Apple often uses privacy as a selling point, but Mr. Cook wasn\u2019t the only critic. Elon Musk deleted SpaceX and Tesla\u2019s Facebook pages, saying that the Tesla one \u201clooks lame anyway.\u201d Sir Martin Sorrell of the ad giant WPP said Facebook needed to \u201cstep up to the mark\u201d and be responsible for content on its platform. And some companies have stopped buying ads on Facebook, highlighting how advertisers want more transparency about performance. (Users also complained that the Android app tracked calls and text messages.)  Meanwhile, Facebook took out full-page ads in several British and American newspapers \u2014 including the NYT \u2014 for an apology signed by Mark Zuckerberg.  Elsewhere in Cambridge Analytica news: A volunteer for the campaign for Britain to leave the E.U. said that a Canadian data company linked to Cambridge Analytica had played a role in the organization\u2019s work. Groups campaigning against Brexit have written to Prime Minister Theresa May demanding an investigation into what members of her cabinet and her staff knew.  Andrew\u2019s take  Mr. Cook\u2019s points on privacy are absolutely right. But he has a tough needle to thread, given that Apple does business in China and acknowledges that it is \u201csubject to each country\u2019s laws\u201d that it does business in. Apple encrypts all user data and says there is no back door \u2014 and I believe that \u2014 most security and political experts have speculated that Beijing might ultimately be able to gain access iCloud data for Chinese customers: It adopted a law requiring all cloud services to be operated by Chinese companies. Apple says that it lobbied against the new law, but ultimately complied.

Federal law enforcement officials are renewing a push for a legal mandate that would allow access to encrypted data in criminal investigations.  Dan Loeb has taken a stake in UTC.  The activist investor\u2019s fund, Third Point, has built a position in United Technologies, according to an antitrust filing.  He is the second activist investor to reveal a stake in the United Technologies during the past 30 days. On Feb. 28, Bill Ackman told CNBC that his Pershing Square had a position in the defense contractor.  Context  At a conference late last month, Greg Hayes, the chief executive of United Technologies, said the company was thinking of splitting up:  \u201cIs [United Technologies] a more valuable property together or is UTC better off in three separate businesses?

Gebr Knauf disclosed in a filing on Monday that it had offered to buy USG for $42 a share, or about $6 billion. That marked a 25 percent premium to USG closing price on Friday.  In rejecting the offer, USG said the proposal substantially undervalued the building products maker.  Knauf owns 10.5 percent of USG, making Knauf the second-largest shareholder in USG behind Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway with a 31 percent stake.  Berkshire had proposed an option for Knauf to buy Berkshire\u2019s stake in USG, according to the filing. The option would be exercisable only if Knauf bought all of USG\u2019s shares outstanding for at least $42. Berkshire proposed an option purchase price of $2 per share.  From Reuters:  The option provides a sweetener for Buffett to shed a profitable investment that originated in late 2008, at the height of the housing crisis, when Berkshire and Canada\u2019s Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd bought $400 million of USG\u2019s debt. The $2 per share cost of the option would provide Berkshire about $86.8 million upfront, based on its 43.39 million share USG stake. Berkshire would keep that money even if Knauf proved unable to buy USG.  Shares of USG are up 19 percent Monday.

Leading them: Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Liu He, Beijing\u2019s economic czar.  Among Washington\u2019s requests, in a letter to Mr. Liu, were lower Chinese tariffs on American cars and more freedom for Wall Street firms to expand in China.  Mr. Mnuchin told \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that he believed the recent rate increase by the Federal Reserve was to blame for recent market declines, not tariffs.

The trouble with writing the unvarnished truth in a memoir is that it requires you to be hard not only on others, but also on yourself.  Matt Young\u2019s inventive, unsparing, irreverent and consistently entertaining \u201cEat the Apple\u201d is that, but it is also a useful corrective to the current idealization of the American soldier \u2014 or in this case a Marine. Patriotism and respect for the military is so high in this country that we have lately held a national debate over whether professional athletes should be required to stand for the national anthem. Men and women in uniform are given preference in boarding airplanes, and are so routinely thanked for their service that the expression has become rote. Each new season brings a crop of movies and glossy TV serials dramatizing the heroics of our Special Operations.  Young sees hollowness and potential harm in this.  \u201cEnforcing the idea that every service member is a hero is dangerous,\u201d he writes. \u201cLike creating a generation of veterans who believe everything they did was good.\u201d Young warns of \u201ccreating an army of fanatics.\u201d  Service deserves respect, of course, but it does not in itself guarantee stirring and selfless acts of bravery. Young is his own case in point. He sees his experience \u2014 three tours in Iraq \u2014 as far from heroic. He is at least as disturbed by his duty as he is proud of it. These contradictory feelings are a central theme in his book. Years removed, he both loathes and pines for the man he became in the Marine Corps. What he calls his \u201cPast-me\u201d was a reckless, selfish, cruel and dangerous man.

That way we can better see what happens when they are deployed. Young writes less about war here than about the culture of being a Marine, one of the few and the proud. His memoir \u2014 its title, \u201cEat the Apple,\u201d refers to a vulgar Marine proverb \u2014 is in its own way a loving portrait, but it is also unsparing, ugly and outrageous.

The chip maker only just wiggled out from under a takeover offer from rival Broadcom. What Qualcomm really needs is less a buyer and more a mediator.  There are usually two reasons to take a company private \u2014 the idea that the new owner can run it better, or a belief that the market is valuing it wrongly. Broadcom took the first path, and pointed at Qualcomm\u2019s paltry revenue growth and relatively low operating margins. Mr. Jacobs, whose father co-founded the company, is not the man to tackle those problems \u2014 if he were, he would have done it when he was executive chairman.  Valuation is a more compelling argument. It hinges on Qualcomm\u2019s rift with Apple. The iPhone maker is supposed to pay Qualcomm royalties on every phone sold, but has instructed its suppliers to hold back payment while it haggles with the chip maker on how those should be calculated.  A simple calculation shows how important this is: At $10 per phone on 250 million devices per year, Qualcomm would make $2.5 billion in revenue a year, almost all of which would flow to the bottom line. That\u2019s equivalent to a lump-sum value of perhaps $17 billion, assuming a tax rate of 21 percent and margins of 85 percent. If investors aren\u2019t pricing in any Apple royalty at all right now, that\u2019s enough to justify a price close to the $117 billion Broadcom offered.  Mr. Jacobs, however, is not the right person to mend the rift with Apple. One person who could, in theory, is SoftBank\u2019s Masayoshi Son. The Japanese investor has a longstanding relationship with Apple \u2014 and counts both Apple and Qualcomm as investors in his Vision Fund, which is also one of the financial companies Mr. Jacobs reportedly has been asking to finance a bid. Conceivably, he could help them split the difference.  Would SoftBank\u2019s founder be up for the gig? Qualcomm, as a leader in 5G, is a trophy asset, and having Mr. Jacobs on board might neutralize some of the fear of foreign ownership that destroyed Broadcom\u2019s bid. But Qualcomm is also politically sensitive, a supplier to SoftBank already \u2014 and very big. Even with help, Qualcomm is probably too big a bite for SoftBank to chew. Mr. Jacobs, and Mr. Son for that matter, can use their daring to better effect elsewhere.", "stock": "AAPL"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/31/technology/personaltech/iphone-battery-slowing-down.html", "label": -1, "source": "the-new-york-times", "date": "2018-01-31", "article": "Apple may be dealing with the fallout for a while. The company published a lengthy memo in December saying that smartphone batteries became less effective over time and that its software was intended to prevent iPhones with older batteries from unexpected shutdowns. Apple also apologized to customers for the slowdowns, offered discounts for its battery-replacement program and said it would introduce software to gain visibility into the health of an iPhone battery.  Yet since then, consumer advocacy groups have filed lawsuits against the company for failing to disclose that the software would throttle old iPhones. The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission have also started an inquiry into the matter, according to a person with knowledge of the situation, who asked not to be named because the details were confidential. Bloomberg earlier reported the inquiry.  Early Wednesday, Apple said in a statement that it had received questions from some government agencies and that it was responding to them; the company did not specify the agencies it had heard from. The Justice Department declined to comment.  As for the wait times that Ms. Schipper and others are experiencing for a battery replacement, a spokeswoman referred to Apple\u2019s support webpage, which states that battery supplies at its stores may be limited.  Let\u2019s not wait around. Here\u2019s a guide to other solutions to keep an iPhone running in the absence of an Apple battery replacement.  Third-Party Repair Shops  Plenty of irate Apple customers are turning to local third-party repair shops to get their iPhone batteries replaced. At Mega Mobile Boston, twice as many customers are coming in for iPhone battery replacements than in years past, said Adam Fullerton, the store\u2019s operations manager.  Third-party repairs are a decent \u2014 but imperfect \u2014 solution. One drawback is that they vary in quality; some repair shops buy lower-quality batteries that don\u2019t last. So to find a good shop, rely on word of mouth and reviews on the web, similar to how you might seek out a good car mechanic.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Another issue is that if you service your phone with a third-party battery and later take your device in to Apple for repair, the company could refuse to service your phone. So if you go the third-party route, chances are you will have to stick with third-party repair shops through the end of your phone\u2019s life.

View all New York Times newsletters.  There\u2019s a less risky route here. On Apple\u2019s support webpage, you can look up third-party repair shops that are authorized by Apple as service providers. These are fixers who have been trained by Apple and carry original parts. But the list is short.  If you find a good local fixer, there are plenty of benefits to sticking with one long term. For one, third-party shops tend to have shorter waits. Mr. Fullerton said his shop could typically get an iPhone battery replacement done in about 30 minutes. The process involves opening the device, cleaning away the old waterproofing adhesive, replacing the battery and applying a new waterproofing adhesive.  For another, local repair shops make their prices competitive with the manufacturer\u2019s. In the case of batteries, many shops are discounting their battery replacements to match Apple\u2019s $29 pricing.  \u201cWe\u2019re probably losing money on it with the cost of a half-hour time from a technician,\u201d Mr. Fullerton said. \u201cBut it\u2019s like a loss leader in any other industry. If you\u2019re Best Buy and you get them to buy one item at cost, maybe you can teach them something about your business.\u201d  Finding a good repair shop can feel daunting, but if you ask around, your peers will probably have recommendations. For a sample, here\u2019s a list of highly recommended repair shops in the United States that I compiled from talking to repair experts I trust:  \u25a0 In Chicago: uBreakiFix Chicago  \u25a0 In San Francisco: MacRepair  \u25a0 In New York: Simple Mac  \u25a0 In Boston: Mega Mobile Boston  \u25a0 In Washington: Computer Geeks  \u25a0 In Austin, Tex.: Austin Mac Repair  Fix It Yourself  You can always replace an iPhone battery by yourself. The pros: You can choose the best components for repairs and minimize costs. The cons: Learning repairs can be time consuming, and if you mess up, you have no one to blame but yourself. And again, Apple stores could refuse to service your phone if it sees you have repaired it with third-party parts.  A good place to start for D.I.Y. repairs is iFixit, a company that provides instruction manuals and components for repairing devices. It is offering discounts on battery replacement kits for older iPhones, which cost $17 to $29. Each kit includes a new battery and the tools for disassembling iPhones.  Installing a phone battery can be intimidating. Replacing an iPhone 7 battery, for example, requires eight tools and 28 steps. Kyle Wiens, the chief executive of iFixit, said some customers also opted to buy a battery from iFixit and then take it to a local repair shop for installation.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Carry a Battery Pack  If you don\u2019t feel confident hiring a third-party fixer or installing your own battery, you can always wait for Apple to replace your battery. But since that could take weeks or months, don\u2019t suffer with a sapped phone battery in the meantime.  A better temporary solution is to invest in a battery pack that you can carry around until replacement batteries arrive at an Apple store. Wirecutter, a New York Times company that reviews products, has tested hundreds of battery packs to recommend a few. My favorite is the Anker PowerCore 20100, which can charge a smartphone every day for a week.  Ms. Schipper, the Seattle resident, is considering buying a battery pack. In the meantime, she is constantly plugging her iPhone into a power outlet because her battery lasts only two hours a day.  Yet she has resisted what she thinks Apple wants: for her to buy a new phone.  \u201cI was tempted to just chuck this phone and suck it up and spend $1,000-plus and get the iPhone X,\u201d she said. \u201cI said, \u2018No, darn it, I have a budget I\u2019m saving up.\u2019 I\u2019m not going to let Apple push me around.\u201d", "stock": "AAPL"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/27/technology/apple-classroom-ipad-google.html", "label": -1, "source": "the-new-york-times", "date": "2018-03-27", "article": "\u201cThese companies know that it\u2019s very important to build mind share at a very early age,\u201d said Linn Huang, a research director at the International Data Corporation, a market research firm known as IDC.  Apple has some catching up to do. Mac laptops and iPads were once the dominant devices in American classrooms, but Google has shot past Apple with inexpensive laptops called Chromebooks. Google has also led the way in software products designed specifically for schools, with an app called Google Classroom that teachers use to take attendance, assign homework and do other tasks, among others.  Of the 12.4 million tablets and laptops shipped to primary and secondary schools in the United States last year, Chromebooks accounted for 58 percent of the market, compared with a negligible share in 2012, according to IDC. In the same period, the share of iPads and Mac laptops fell to 22 percent from about half. And Microsoft Windows devices dropped to 18 percent from about 45 percent, IDC said.  School districts embraced Chromebooks because they were comparatively inexpensive and easy to use. Since the laptops were cloud-based, they could be shared among students who could pick up any device to get access to their documents. And school districts could use a software dashboard to manage thousands of devices at once. Districts that needed to institute online testing began buying Chromebooks in bulk.  Still, Apple generates the most revenue from school hardware sales in the United States, partly because its devices cost more. Of the $5.4 billion spent on school devices last year in the United States, Apple\u2019s iPads and laptops accounted for about $2.1 billion, followed by Chromebooks at $1.95 billion and Microsoft Windows devices at $1.35 billion, according to IDC.  Photo  Apple\u2019s new iPad signals how the company sees an opening at the lower end of the market. Last year, it lowered the price of its entry-level iPad to $329 for consumers and $299 for schools, helping to bolster sales of iPads after years of declines. Some Chromebooks and Windows laptops cost less than $200.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  But as the American market for classroom devices matures and school districts prepare to replace the basic Chromebook laptops they purchased, analysts said Apple was well positioned to take advantage of growing interest among school districts for more sophisticated technologies that encourage student creativity in fields like robotics and computer-assisted design.  \u201cWe\u2019re starting to see an evolution of use cases around coding, STEM, creative arts and design, some of the areas where Apple is focused,\u201d said Ben Davis, a senior analyst in education at Futuresource Consulting, a market research firm that tracks school device shipments. \u201cIn theory, we should start to see a trade-up in computing power in the devices going into schools to support that.\u201d  Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Apple also mentions using \u2018polarizer layers\u2019 to help reduce any possible reflections of the light of one screen on the other, and which may also allow the user to view the screens outdoors while wearing sunglasses.  The patent mentions not just a MacBook use case, but also the possibility of having a detachable 2-in-1 built like this, which might indicate that Apple could be considering pairing up this invention with the iPad rather than its notebooks.  As ever, this is just a patent, and its existence doesn\u2019t necessarily mean anything for either MacBooks or iPads; ultimately, the concept may never leave the development and testing labs.  Patently polarizing  If it does come to fruition as a MacBook, it\u2019s likely not just going to have \u2018polarizer layers\u2019, but also a polarizing effect \u2013 there are certainly those who dislike the Touch Bar, and they\u2019re unlikely to welcome the expansion of the concept to a full virtual keyboard.  There may be doubts about exactly how effective such a virtual peripheral can be compared to the typing action of a physical keyboard. Although Lenovo has already done something similar with its Yoga Book convertible complete with virtual Halo Keyboard, and we were \u201camazed\u201d at how accurate the typing experience felt.  Perhaps what will be more worrying to those in the doubting camp is what this might do to the price tag of the MacBook. Especially if you look at the inflationary effect the introduction of the Touch Bar had on Apple\u2019s notebook range.  Still, we shouldn\u2019t get ahead of ourselves here, and the concept is definitely an interesting one if it does ever see the light of day.

The largest U.S.-listed company by market capitalization has risen for five straight sessions, including a 3.4% jump on Thursday after regulatory filings showed Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway raised its stake in the iPhone maker last quarter.  That took Apple\u2019s price to $172.99, up nearly 12% from its recent low and pulling it out of correction territory.  The S&P 500 is similarly up for five straight sessions, marking its largest five-day percentage gain since December of 2011, according to The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Market Data Group. The index is up 5.8% from its 2018 closing low from Feb. 8, as our Morning MoneyBeat newsletter noted on Friday.  Apple and its tech-giant peers are still a leading force in the stock market, even after driving gains for most of the nearly nine-year-old bull market and especially the last year. For those trying to discern where stocks head next in an uncertain market, Apple\u2019s stock is as good a place to look as any.  Apple dropped more than 13% during the worst of the recent selloff. The company had a particularly bad session in early February, dropping 4.3% the day after an earnings report that showed the company sold fewer iPhones and projected weaker-than-expected revenue for the current quarter. Both Apple and the S&P 500 pointed slightly lower in premarket trade Friday.  The selloff proved to be short-lived. Wall Street analysts, bullish group that they are, still expect Apple\u2019s stock to keep gaining. Among the 39 whose price targets are tracked by FactSet, analysts project on average gain of 11% over the next year to a price of $192.06. The recent selloff only caused them to lower targets slightly from $193.03 at the end of last month.  Apple hasn\u2019t been pushing the market higher on its own, of course. Ten of the 11 sectors in the S&P 500 were in the green on Thursday. But the technology sector was the S&P 500\u2032s second-best performing on Thursday. What\u2019s more, it has had the second-best performance so far this year, up 5.7%.  A key driver of the sector is Apple, whose $878 billion market cap gives it a 3.5% weighting in the S&P 500, according to FactSet. That means it has more push and pull on the index than any other single company.

Apple launched the expensive device later than usual during its fiscal first quarter that ended Dec. 30. The phone came on the 10th anniversary of the company\u2019s first smartphone, and was heralded by Apple and its fans as the \u201cfuture of smartphones.\u201d But an opening price of $1,000 is rich for any smartphone, and production issues appeared to keep supply of the phone relatively tight at least in the first few weeks after its early November launch.  That appeared to weigh down sales. Apple said Thursday that it sold a total of 77.3 million iPhones during the quarter, which was below the 80 million units analysts had been expecting. That made for a 1% year-over-year decline in iPhone unit sales for the quarter, though iPhone revenue popped by 13% to hit $61.6 billion. That is a signal that the iPhone X appealed to enough of the company\u2019s fan base to boost iPhone\u2019s average selling price to about $796\u2014the highest on record and a strong 15% jump from the same period last year.  That still isn\u2019t the \u201csupercycle\u201d that many investors have been expecting. And Apple\u2019s outlook for the fiscal second quarter ending in March suggests more of the same. The company projected total revenue in the range of $60 billion to $62 billion for the quarter, which would make for a year-over-year gain of 15%. Despite reports that Apple is cutting iPhone production this quarter due to weaker sales, Wall Street still had been expecting overall revenue to rise 24% in the quarter.  Apple\u2019s share price had slipped about 6% over the past two weeks, so the disappointing projection was somewhat priced in. And the company is still immensely profitable, with operating income jumping 12% year over year to a record $26.3 billion.  Any concerns about cyclical iPhone sales were somewhat soothed by Apple\u2019s service-arm revenue, which had another period of double-digit growth during the quarter. Services comprised nearly 13% of Apple\u2019s trailing 12-month revenue compared with 9% two years ago.

AAPL 0.34% is scheduled to report results for its fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 30, after the market closes Thursday. Here\u2019s what you need to know.  EARNINGS FORECAST: Earnings of $3.86 a share is the consensus of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters, compared with $3.36 a share a year ago. The company hasn\u2019t provided earnings guidance for the quarter but in November said it expects gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5% in the quarter.  REVENUE FORECAST: Revenue of $87.06 billion is expected by analysts, compared with $78.4 billion reported a year earlier. In November, Apple said it expected revenue to be between $84 billion and $87 billion in the quarter.  Dollars & Cents: Apple raised prices last year in a move that has the potential to boost overall revenue even as the number of iPhones it sells stagnates. Analysts believe the strategy paid off in December. Apple is projected to report a 1.5% increase in iPhone shipments, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet, but the $1,000 iPhone X, released on Nov. 3, is expected to lift the average selling price of the device 9% to $755. Those higher prices are expected to lift iPhone revenue 10% to $60 billion in the period. Meanwhile, Apple kept more old iPhone models on the market in December, a move that market research firm Strategy Analytics predicts helped the company increase iPhone shipments 22% in China.  Taxman: Apple in mid-January announced it would pay $38 billion in taxes on the $252 billion it holds overseas, but it hasn\u2019t said how much of that money it will bring back to the U.S. or outlined what will be returned to shareholders through buybacks or dividends. The company typically announces capital return plans in April or May and may hold off discussing it until then. But expect analysts to ask for more clarity on Apple\u2019s plans now that it no longer needs to hold cash overseas to avoid paying higher U.S. taxes. Also, look for the company to update its new effective tax rate. Morgan Stanley expects Apple to benefit from a lower tax rate of approximately 15.9% due to tax reform, adding $1.13 to its current fiscal-year earnings per share  Promised Land: Analysts and investors will zero in on Apple\u2019s revenue projections for the March quarter. With the iPhone X contributing less than two months of sales during the last quarter, many analysts had banked on strong sales in the current period because of pent up demand. Some have scuttled those projections recently amid reports that iPhone manufacturing has slowed. Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein reduced his projections for the current quarter to 53 million units from 66 million and warned the earnings call could trigger downward earnings estimates for the period. Analysts currently project revenue for the March quarter of $66.54 billion, according to FactSet.  The Great Divide: Apple doesn\u2019t break out its mix of iPhone sales by model, forcing analysts and investors to come up with their own estimates. One of the key indicators of demand is channel inventory. Apple tries to keep inventory in the five- to seven-week range. UBS analyst Steve Milunovich said that if the iPhone X is a disappointment relative to Apple\u2019s expectations, then the company\u2019s inventory levels could be higher. During its last earnings call for the quarter ended Sept. 30, the company indicated it expected healthy demand for the iPhone X by saying it increased inventory by 1.3 million smartphone units to support the iPhone 8 launch, 50% less than the 2.5 million it added during the release of the iPhone 7 in the same period a year earlier.  Trouble No More: The company\u2019s business in China is showing signs of improvement. Sales rose in the September quarter from a year earlier, marking the first quarterly gain in more than a year. Analysts expect this quarter to deliver another increase with sales projected to rise 9.2% to $17.73 billion, according to FactSet. The growth is expected to be driven by improved iPhone sales in that market and the continued strength of App Store sales.", "stock": "AAPL"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/icloud-storage-your-guide-to-the-other-apple-tax-1516820540", "label": -1, "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "date": "2018-01-24", "article": "Sick of Apple's iCloud ransom notes demanding money for more storage space? WSJ's Joanna Stern has tips on how to defuse the situation. Photo: Natalia Osipova/The Wall Street Journal.  Every night, I compose the following letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook :  Dear Mr. Cook,  Your iCloud storage is full.  Yours,  Joanna Stern  I never send it because I\u2019m not as unsympathetic as Apple, which by my count blasts out millions of annoying out-of-iCloud-storage alerts a day. Hey look! You got one just now.  I call them iCloud ransom notes. Don\u2019t pay Apple for storage and the threats will persist and all your data will be unsafe. Pay and the messages will end. Plus, you\u2019ll get some\u2026 iCloud. Whatever that is.  Apple is pretty matter-of-fact about it: \u201cWe notify our customers when they need more storage to continue to keep their information safely backed up in iCloud,\u201d a spokesman says.  If you have an iPhone, you\u2019ve probably seen one of these. Apple sends notifications to millions of customers when they need more storage space so their information remains safely backed up in iCloud. These messages can be avoided. Photo: APPLE  Yet after the holiday iPhone buying season, I began to realize that many of even the most tech-savvy people in my life don\u2019t quite understand how iCloud works. Heck, I had to go to an Apple Store\u2019s iCloud class to get some clarity. And my dad didn\u2019t know he had \u201cthe iCloud\u201d until he remembered the $1 monthly charge.  So I decided to tackle the messy, many-tendriled storage system. What do we need to understand? What does Apple need to start doing better? The following guide helps those who pay for iCloud get their money\u2019s worth\u2014and those who refuse to pay for iCloud live a happier, notification-free life.  What is iCloud?  Lose your iPhone but have iCloud? You won\u2019t lose much at all. That\u2019s the simplest way to understand this thing.  If your photos, videos, contacts and more are backed up to iCloud, they\u2019re safe and accessible from any other Apple device\u2014and most web browsers\u2014by just logging in. For a quick overview of what you actually have stored, log into icloud.com with your Apple ID and poke around.  Here\u2019s the big catch, though: Apple offers only 5 gigabytes of free iCloud storage space. That\u2019s like offering a Siberian tiger a Tic Tac for dinner. With the amount of photos and videos we take today, it\u2019s not enough. For a company with about $270 billion in the bank, I\u2019d expect it to at least match Google\u2019s 15GB of free cloud storage\u2014or beat it. Do I hear 20GB?  If you do need more, Apple charges you: $1 a month for 50GB, $3 for 200GB, $10 for 2 terabytes.  Before we dive into the rest, take out your iPhone. Go to Settings, then tap your name up top, then tap iCloud. You should be looking at a handy bar graph of your own iCloud storage allotment.  Photo: The Wall Street Journal  Chances are your bar graph is going to be dominated by two big chunks:  Backups. When your device is on Wi-Fi, locked and charging, iCloud automatically backs up all the data\u2014messages, settings, your homescreen layout, app data and more.  Photos. The Photos app has a clever trick: It uploads shots as soon as you take them. This iCloud Photo Library setting is on by default; if you turn it off, photos and videos are included in backups.  If that bar graph is getting filled up, you\u2019re probably starting to get those nagging out-of-storage notifications, which brings us to Mr. Frost\u2019s two diverging roads.  Road 1: Fine, I\u2019ll Pay  OK, so you agree to pay Apple every month.  First, you\u2019ve got to decide on a plan, and the new iCloud storage family sharing is incentive to pay for the 200GB or 2TB plans. Since last fall\u2019s iOS 11 release, you can share those buckets of storage with up to five members of your family. Don\u2019t worry, Johnny, if you upload a photo of your new vape, Mom won\u2019t be able to see it.  Whichever plan you choose should cover your phone backups and all-important photo storage. But you still need to fine-tune the way photos are handled.  On your iPhone, go to Settings, then scroll down and tap Photos. If you are worried about running out of space on your iPhone itself, select \u201cOptimize iPhone Storage.\u201d  Photo: The Wall Street Journal  This ensures that full-resolution photos and videos are stored in iCloud. You\u2019ll still see preview images on the phone, but it sometimes takes a few seconds before you can view the sharp original pic.  How do you tell what is actually backed up? You should see the update status on the bottom of the first Photos tab.  Once your backups are on track and your photos are squared away, you may find you have leftover space. This is where iCloud Drive comes into play. You can dump random files into it through the iCloud web interface, or\u2014on a Mac with the latest OS\u2014sync your Desktop and Documents files.  On iPads and iPhones, there\u2019s a new Files app, which is, confusingly, another door to iCloud Drive. Plus, you can add files in iOS through supported Apple apps such as Pages, Keynote and Notes, or through the sharing function: Tap the share button, then \u201cSave to Files.\u201d  While you can use iCloud Drive to sync files across your multiple devices, it still lacks some of the basics you get with Google Drive or Dropbox. For instance, on iCloud.com you can\u2019t upload a folder of files from your desktop.  Road 2: Nope, Not Paying  OK, you\u2019ve bought a phone for $700 or more and decided not even $1 more for Apple. Understandable.  So how do you survive with just 5GB and make the ransom notes cease? First, try to clear room. Delete backups of your old devices by going to iCloud > Manage Storage > Backup.  Photo: The Wall Street Journal  Apple doesn\u2019t offer a way to see the thousands of compressed files in these old backups. There are third party apps, such as AnyTrans, that do.  You can also thin out your current backup: Tap on the backup labeled \u201cThis iPhone\u201d then turn off third-party apps. There\u2019s no real need to back up apps like Twitter and Facebook ; just back up games that save your progress.  If that isn't enough, turn off iCloud backup altogether (iCloud > iCloud Backup). You can still manually back up your iPhone by syncing to iTunes\u2014even via Wi-Fi.  Backing up photos, of course, remains a necessity. For that, I recommend Google Photos, since it offers unlimited cloud storage for photos and videos. Photos with resolution over 16 megapixels will be downsized, but you can use Google\u2019s included 15GB of storage to keep those higher-resolution shots.  I find the transition process to be cleanest on a computer. Pull all the photos you have from your phone\u2014plus any photos that may live in your iCloud storage\u2014into the Photos app on your Mac, then go to File > Export. On Windows, use the iCloud for Windows app.  Go to Google Photos, then either drag all your photos to it, or use the uploader tool. Back on your iPhone or iPad, in the iCloud settings, turn off iCloud Photo Library and download the Google Photos app.  I leave you here with a moral challenge: Every time a storage-full message makes you mad, take to social media and urge Apple to give us 20GB free. Or just pay Apple the damn dollar.

The focus on groups came after the social network, which has 1.4 billion daily active users, had been criticized for its role in the distribution of so-called fake news.  Facebook and other internet groups such as Google\u2019s YouTube (GOOGL.O) and Twitter (TWTR.N) have also faced pressure from the European Union and European governments to do more to stem the proliferation of extremist content on their platforms.  The company\u2019s top European executive Nicola Mendelsohn said in December that the number of people working on safety on the platform would double to 20,000 by the end of 2018, including more engineers in London.

FILE PHOTO: Facebook Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks on stage during the annual Facebook F8 developers conference in San Jose, California, U.S., April 18, 2017. REUTERS/Stephen Lam/File Photo  The company, which has more than 2 billion monthly users, said its members, not experts or Facebook executives, would determine how news outlets rank in terms of trustworthiness. It also said it would put an emphasis on local news sources.  The move is likely to send shockwaves through the media landscape in nearly every country, given the ubiquity of the world\u2019s largest social network and how central it has become in some places to the distribution of news.  Zuckerberg said on Friday he expects recently announced changes to shrink the amount of news on Facebook by 20 percent, to about 4 percent of all content from 5 percent currently.  The chief executive outlined the shakeup in a post on Facebook, saying that starting next week the News Feed, the company\u2019s centrepiece product, would prioritise \u201chigh quality news\u201d over less trusted sources.  \u201cThere\u2019s too much sensationalism, misinformation and polarization in the world today,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote.  \u201cSocial media enables people to spread information faster than ever before, and if we don\u2019t specifically tackle these problems, then we end up amplifying them,\u201d he wrote.  The quality of news on Facebook has been called into question after alleged Russian operatives, for-profit spammers and others spread false reports on the site, including during the 2016 U.S. election campaign.  Two years ago, Facebook users saw hoaxes saying Pope Francis endorsed Republican Donald Trump for U.S. president and that a federal agent investigating Democrat Hillary Clinton was found dead. Facebook initially proposed fighting false stories by letting users flag them.  The change will affect not only links posted by news outlets but also news stories that individuals share, Facebook said.  News organizations immediately began considering how they would fare in the ranking.  FIGHTING FAKE NEWS  The trust ranking will help to address fake news stories, said David Chavern, president of the News Media Alliance, a trade group for old-line U.S. newspapers.  \u201cFor some time, we have argued that Facebook should give priority to news from trusted sources,\u201d he said in a statement.  Tom Gara, opinion editor at BuzzFeed News, wrote on Twitter that he expected partisan outlets to fare worse: \u201cThis sounds like extremely good news for news publishers that aren\u2019t hated by one side or the other.\u201d  Facebook has had a stormy relationship with news organizations, especially those with strong political leanings. In 2016, Republican U.S. lawmakers expressed concern that Facebook, based in liberal Northern California, was suppressing news stories of interest to conservative readers.  Facebook said that ranking by trustworthiness was not intended to directly impact any specific groups of publishers based on their size or ideology.  Zuckerberg said he settled on the idea of surveying Facebook users after rejecting having the company itself rank news outlets\u2019 trustworthiness.  \u201cWe decided that having the community determine which sources are broadly trusted would be most objective,\u201d he wrote in his post.  Facebook said it did not plan to release the survey results because they will represent an incomplete picture of how a story\u2019s position in a person\u2019s feed is determined.  Many factors determine where a post appears in a Facebook user\u2019s News Feed such as subject of the post, who wrote it and who is commenting on it.  Last week, Zuckerberg said the company would change the way it filters posts and videos on News Feed to prioritise what friends and family share.  News Corp (NWSA.O), owner of the New York Post and other outlets, responded to the earlier Facebook announcement with a pledge to look for \u201cany signs that the weighting of news sites is politically motivated.\u201d  The Rupert Murdoch-led company had no immediate comment on Friday.", "stock": "FB"}, {"url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-03/trump-s-campaign-said-it-was-better-at-facebook-facebook-agrees", "label": 1, "source": "bloomberg", "date": "2018-04-03", "article": "Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign has boasted often that it made better use of Facebook Inc.\u2019s advertising tools than Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign did. An internal Facebook white paper, published days after the election, shows the company\u2019s data scientists agree.  \u201cBoth campaigns spent heavily on Facebook between June and November of 2016,\u201d the author of the internal paper writes, citing revenue of $44 million for Trump and $28 million for Clinton in that period. \u201cBut Trump\u2019s FB campaigns were more complex than Clinton\u2019s and better leveraged Facebook\u2019s ability to optimize for outcomes.\u201d  The paper, obtained by Bloomberg and discussed here for the first time, describes in granular detail the difference between Trump\u2019s campaign, which was focused on finding new donors, and Clinton\u2019s campaign, which concentrated on ensuring Clinton had broad appeal. The data scientist says 84 percent of Trump\u2019s budget asked people on Facebook to take an action, like donating, compared with 56 percent of Clinton\u2019s.  Facebook didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.  Trump ran 5.9 million different versions of ads during the presidential campaign and rapidly tested them to spread those that generated the most Facebook engagement, according to the paper. Clinton ran 66,000 different kinds of ads in the same period.  As is typical at Facebook, employees had access to the white paper, according to a person familiar with the matter. Employees routinely publish papers so colleagues can dig into issues facing the company and learn how certain products work.  A former Facebook employee cited the information from the white paper in a memo to Representative Adam Schiff\u2019s office in early March, saying it could help Congress ask the right questions about whether the campaign coordinated with Russia. For example, according to the paper, more than a quarter of Trump\u2019s ad spending was tied to third-party data files on voters, and leveraged a Facebook tool that helped the campaign show ads to people who looked similar to the names on file. Clinton\u2019s ads aimed for broader audiences, with only 4 percent of her Facebook spend on the lookalike tool.  \u201cDid Russian operatives give the Trump campaign a list of names to include or exclude from advertising that was running on Facebook?\u201d the former employee asked in the memo.  Republicans shut down the House of Representatives\u2019 investigation into Russia and Trump days later, \u201cleaving questions unanswered, leads unexplored, countless witnesses uncalled, subpoenas unissued,\u201d Schiff, a California Democrat, wrote on Twitter. A Schiff spokesman declined to comment for this story.  But Congress is still focusing on the use of third-party information on Facebook for another reason: the company\u2019s ensuing crisis over data on 50 million users obtained by Cambridge Analytica, a political advertising firm that helped Trump\u2019s campaign. Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg is set to make his first congressional testimony on the issue in a matter of days.  One key question Zuckerberg is likely to face, raised in the former employee\u2019s memo to Schiff: What lists of Facebook users did Trump\u2019s campaign upload for advertising purposes?  Facebook is still working to unearth other information that congressional investigators have requested. The company is continuing to comb through its site to identify content posted by the Internet Research Agency, a Russian organization that used Facebook to manipulate public discourse in America ahead of the election. On Tuesday, the company took down more than 270 accounts and pages operated by the IRA that were used to spread messages to people in Russia and neighboring countries.  \u201cThis is the next step towards removing them from Facebook entirely,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote Tuesday on his Facebook page. \u201cOrganizations like the IRA are sophisticated adversaries who are constantly evolving, but we\u2019ll keep improving our techniques to stay ahead -- especially when it comes to protecting the integrity of elections.\u201d", "stock": "FB"}, {"url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-09/facebook-says-play-ball-in-exclusive-deal-to-stream-25-mlb-games", "label": 1, "source": "bloomberg", "date": "2018-03-09", "article": "Facebook Inc. reached a deal with Major League Baseball for exclusive rights to stream 25 afternoon games on the social network in the U.S.  It\u2019s the first time a major U.S. league has agreed to show regular season games exclusively on Facebook, which has been building a portfolio of live sports. MLB owners unanimously approved the move, the league said. Neither MLB nor Facebook disclosed the financial terms, though people with knowledge of the matter put the price at $30 million to $35 million. They asked not to be identified because the terms are private.  \u201cMuch like the migration of sports from broadcast to cable, you\u2019re reaching these milestones where the combination of the financial incentive and the audience allow you to make the next great leap,\u201d said Lee Berke, an industry consultant. \u201cThis is part of the next great leap.\u201d  The games add to Facebook\u2019s growing sports lineup. Last year, the company struck deals with Fox Sports to stream the UEFA Champions League and with Univision to broadcast live games from Mexico\u2019s top soccer league. The company also had 20 non-exclusive MLB games last season and acquired exclusive rights to stream 47 college basketball games involving smaller conferences this year.  With 1.4 billion active daily users, the world\u2019s biggest social network is also still growing, in contrast with conventional TV networks that have been losing viewers and advertising. Facebook\u2019s ad revenue last year totaled $40 billion.  Weekday Afternoons  All of the games will take place on weekday afternoons, primarily Wednesdays. The agreement begins with the April 4 game between the Philadelphia Phillies and New York Mets. Viewers will be able to watch on smartphones, tablets, computers and other connected devices, including home TVs.  The games will be produced by the MLB Network, meaning they\u2019ll have a broadcast look and feel. For Facebook, however, the rights allow for experimentation with things like social integration and graphics during the broadcast, enhancements popular with younger viewers drawn to digital platforms.  Facebook will also have rights to show the baseball games globally, though they won\u2019t be exclusive outside the U.S. MLB and Facebook will update the schedule on a monthly basis.  MLB will produce and distribute specially curated content, in addition to each live game broadcast, including on-demand highlight packages for every regular season game, as well as club-specific weekly recap packages for all 30 MLB teams. These will be available on Facebook Watch in the U.S. and around the world.  Football Rights  Earlier this year, Facebook opted against bidding for the National Football League\u2019s Thursday Night package, which Amazon.com Inc. carried last season. Facebook had bid the previous two years. The company did acquire the rights to NFL recaps and highlights, giving the league a way to reach fans on the social media service.

Changes rolled out so far by Facebook Inc., Twitter Inc. and other technology companies wouldn\u2019t prevent the tactics revealed Friday by U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation of Russian operatives -- let alone any new hacks dreamed up by bad actors.  An indictment issued by Mueller said at least 13 Russians engaged in a sophisticated campaign to sway public opinion around the 2016 presidential election. They posed as U.S. citizens, using falsified paperwork and stolen bank numbers, to hide their real identities and opened PayPal Holdings Inc. accounts to buy ads on popular social media sites.  The narrative laid out by Mueller describes a more advanced Russian-backed misinformation effort than previously known. Until now, Facebook and Twitter had been criticized for missing Russian purchases of U.S. election ads through their systems. PayPal hadn\u2019t featured publicly in the investigations until Friday.  The identity theft detailed in the indictment is tougher than the problems these companies have so far tried to solve. Facebook is boosting its security-focused workforce and adding transparency for who purchases ads. Twitter is creating a \u201ctransparency center\u201d on political campaign ad spending, too. Alphabet Inc.\u2019s YouTube is hiring thousands of people to vet videos. None of these steps would prevent foreign agents from using stolen identities and bank accounts to buy divisive ads and create misleading posts.  PayPal is a pioneer in online identity and fraud detection. And yet, it\u2019s digital payments service was the funding vehicle for the Russian operatives\u2019 deceptive campaigns -- making their transactions appear in social media companies\u2019 systems like any other purchases in U.S. dollars.  The Russians\u2019 approach raises the question of whether other parties have bought -- or will buy -- ads using stolen identities. It also undermines the main value of social media business models: That people are who they say they are. Facebook and Twitter sell ads through automated systems where brands can opt to reach certain audiences, and later find out how many people they reached. Friday\u2019s indictment shows how this system can be easily gamed, and highlights the risk that even more accounts may not be fake, eroding trust in those metrics.  Meanwhile, as long as social media platforms work the way they do, by making it easy to pay to spread incendiary messages, it\u2019s hard to see this problem going away, said Zeynep Tufekci, an information sciences professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  \u201cThey used the platforms as they were designed,\u201d Tufekci wrote on Twitter from a verified account. \u201cAll the problems most everyone is worried about will be with us pretty much at the same scale in 2018 and 2020 even if not another ruble is spent on U.S. elections.\u201d  The indictment also described how the Russian operatives used online distribution and marketing tactics that were as advanced as any legitimate social media campaign -- making it difficult for companies to detect anomalies. The operatives worked in shifts to ensure they made posts in accordance with U.S. time zones and circulated lists of U.S. holidays so the accounts posing as citizens could post appropriate content, according to the indictment. They also regularly evaluated their content to make sure it appeared authentic, and received feedback on how much text, graphics or video to use to appear naturally American.  The indictment has already renewed calls to regulate social media. Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, said Mueller\u2019s investigation shows Russia was using online ads to wage an \u201cinformation war\u201d against the U.S. and Congress should pass new laws to police political advertising on social media immediately.  \u201cWe do not have time to wait. If Congress continues to refuse to act, we are aiding Russia\u2019s efforts to divide and influence our nation\u2014inaction is unacceptable,\u201d Klobuchar said in an emailed statement. She is a co-sponsor of the Honest Ads Act, which would regulate online election ads.  Next month, the Federal Election Commission will also consider a proposal to require online political ads to carry the same disclaimers from sponsors as do radio, television and print ads.  \u201cWe know we have more to do to prevent against future attacks,\" Joel Kaplan, Facebook\u2019s vice president of global policy, said in a statement on Friday.  Facebook is working closely with the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and other companies on better ways to protect the U.S. and the company\u2019s users, he added. The FBI has created task force on election interference, and Facebook is actively working with the agency, Kaplan also said.  Ahead of midterm elections in the U.S. later this year, Twitter said it\u2019s verifying major party candidates for all statewide and federal elective offices, and major national party accounts, as a \"hedge against impersonation.\" The company is also improving its anti-spam technology to track down networks of malicious bots targeting election-related matters, while monitoring trends and spikes in conversations about the 2018 elections to spot potential manipulation.  \"Tech companies cannot defeat this novel, shared threat alone,\" Twitter said in a statement. \"The best approach is to share information and ideas to increase our collective  knowledge, with the full weight of government and law enforcement leading the charge against threats to our democracy.\"", "stock": "FB"}, {"url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-09/facebook-testing-a-downvote-button-to-judge-people-s-comments", "label": 1, "source": "bloomberg", "date": "2018-02-09", "article": "Facebook Inc. is testing a button that would let users \u201cdownvote\u201d other people\u2019s comments on public posts.

It's meant to be useful to special effects artists and anybody else working in film or virtual reality \u2014 \"flicks\" cleanly divide each frame in a movie, TV show, or video game in an easy-to-read, easy-to-use number.  Facebook has invented a new unit of time: The \"flick,\" equivalent to precisely one 705,600,000th of a second \u2014 larger than a nanosecond, and smaller than a microsecond.  It's short for \"frame tick,\" hinting at its cinematic origins, writes original inventor Christopher Horvath on GitHub.  As for why Facebook needs a new unit of time, it goes back to the social network's Oculus VR subsidiary and its larger bet on virtual reality. And for Horvath, formerly of the cinematic world at firms like Pixar, Weta Digital, and Industrial Light & Magic, it seems to have been something of a passion project.  In film, video games, and any other kind of visual, screen-based medium, creators have to think in split-seconds. Most movies, for instance, are shot at 24 frames per second, which means that the film displays 24 still images every second in a rapid sequence to give the illusion of motion.  The problem, as described by Horvath, is that the math gets messy when you try to work on one frame at a time. At 24 frames per second, or FPS, each frame is approximately .04166666667 seconds long, or 41666666.669 nanoseconds. Those numbers are inelegant, with endlessly repeating decimals. In turn, that can make life difficult for programmers and artists who are trying to work precisely at these scales.  That's where the Facebook flick comes in. It can represent a single frame at a nice, even number, at a whole variety of framerates. For instance, at the 24 FPS of most movies, each frame is 29,400,000 flicks. At 60 FPS, seen as a desirable framerate for action-packed video games, each frame is 11,760,000 flicks long. It's a clean number that can easily be divided or added up, without worrying about decimal points.  Facebook has actually released its documentation for the creation and use of flicks as open source, meaning that anybody can download it and add support for the unit into their own software. That, in turn, means that flicks could become a standard unit of time \u2014 if not on your wristwatch, then in the visual arts.", "stock": "FB"}, {"url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-users-50-million-fewer-hours-facebook-2018-1", "label": 1, "source": "business-insider", "date": "2018-01-31", "article": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg Adnan Abidi/Reuters  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said users are spending less time on the social network every day.

Attn: CEO Matthew Segal tells Business Insider that Facebook is emphasizing loyal audiences, interactivity, and longer episodes.  Starting in the fall, Facebook began to greenlight a handful of second seasons for its TV-like \"Watch\" shows. And now \"We Need to Talk,\" Attn:'s relationship advice series starring Nev Schulman (of \"Catfish\" fame) and his wife Laura Perlongo, has gotten a 10-episode order.  Business Insider talked to Attn: CEO Matthew Segal about what it took to get a renewal from Facebook, which has been selective about the series that have made it past season one. Segal said the most important factor was this: \"a loyal, repeat audience.\"  \"I know it's something that Facebook's looking at,\" Segal explained. \"Can viewers return from one episode to the next in the habitual way that implies fandom.\"  This makes sense when you consider what Facebook wants Watch to be. The tech giant is focused on making the Watch tab something that doesn't just rely on the same behavior as the news feed. Facebook wants people to check back for new episodes, like they do on YouTube or traditional TV. (One Watch partner told Business Insider that Facebook would prefer a show with fewer \"views,\" if the audience were coming back week after week, and didn't rely on the virality of a particular episode.)  Talk to your viewers  Segal said the other big factor was the \"interactivity\" of a show. This leans into Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's new mandate of promoting meaningful interactions.  \"Before we went into production on season one, we had Nev and Laura ask people\" what dating topics to cover, Segal said. And in season two, Attn: is going deeper into the fan feedback aspect.  \"For season two it's going to be even more interactive,\" Segal said. \"We are literally going to ask users to comment on their own experiences, and advice.\" Segal said the hosts will ask the audience about topics like how to ask people out, changing gender roles, money troubles, and so on. And there will be segments on the show when Nev and Laura are responding to reader feedback in real-time (though the episodes won't be live).  \"We Need to Talk\" isn't the only show that has used interactivity to find success.  According to a Watch partner, Mike Rowe's show \"Returning the Favor\" has been used by Facebook as an example of a show that's doing really well. Rowe asks for fan feedback on every show. \"We've already proven the best way to get people interested in RTF is to ask them to program each episode,\" he recently told Tubefilter.  Simply bigger  Season two of \"We Need to Talk\" will also be longer, with episodes falling more in the 10-12 minute range versus 3-6 minutes.  \"We've hired a whole writers room for this season, and there's lot of jokes peppered in,\" Segal said, though some of the show is unscripted as well.  There is definitely a bigger budget for this season, though Segal didn't comment on the exact figure.

Facebook doesn't have much incentive to listen.  The company is already reticent about being seen as a media company and is moving away from the news business.  Media companies don't have a ton of leverage over Facebook or Google.  Plus the technological challenges involved in either getting paid or choking off Facebook are significant.  The newsrooms at the 'old media' Wall Street Journal and 'digital native' BuzzFeed may not see eye-to-eye on much, but suddenly their bosses have lots to bond over.  That's because, in one way or another, both News Corp. chairman Rupert Murdoch and BuzzFeed CEO Jonah Peretti believe that Facebook and Google aren't giving news organizations a fair deal. They want them to pay up for news stories shared on the platforms.  In each case, however, it's not clear whether any single news organization has serious leverage against the duopoly, or, as Business Insider's Nathan McAlone noted, the technical wherewithal to actually pull or block all of their content from either platform.  Still, it's not crazy to think that Facebook, in particular, could and probably should pay publishers to distribute their content. But who says they care enough or see what's in it for them?  Why should Facebook listen to Rupert Murdoch?  Murdoch doesn't make any explicit threats in his fiery note. It's easy to see why. What threat could he make? Could he pull down the New York Post's Facebook page tomorrow? Would people notice or care? This isn't like MTV going dark on a cable system in the 1990s, which would inevitably lead to fans calling their cable switchboard to complain.  More importantly, Murdoch couldn't stop people from posting New York Post articles to Facebook, could it? I asked Gabriele Boland, manager of content strategy at the social media analytics firm News Whip, and she said she's not sure how they would.Making links 'not shareable' is one potential way but that seems counterproductive. Publishers want people passing around their stories. One way to go would be for the New York Post to charge for everything,  \"A news site could extremely limit its own Facebook traffic by \"pay-walling\" their content,\" Boland said, noting that even a fully pay-walled property like the Financial Times still racks up tons of engagement on Facebook.  Ok, what about the idea that Facebook needs good content, that it's part of the reason people like hanging out there?  \"The publishers are obviously enhancing the value and integrity of Facebook through their news and content but are not being adequately rewarded for those services,\" Murdoch wrote on Monday.  Maybe this is true. But if anything, the tech giant seems to want to make news go away on Facebook, rather the get further into bed with it.  Murdoch has talked tough about this before  Back in 2009, Murdoch talked about blocking all of his company's news stories from Google search entirely. He had support in the \"Google is bad for news\" camp. Around that time, noted mogul Mark Cuban (\"Shark Tank\") called Google a \"vampire.\"  There was even industry chatter - believe it or not - that a bunch of news organizations could ban together and pull their content from Google searches in favor or Microsoft's Bing.  But alas, nobody went through with it, as it was likely way too scary to give up the traffic Google searches deliver.  The same kind of fears would be top of mind for anyone mulling a full Facebook boycott.  Here's the case for paying publishers, besides being a nice thing for the world  If you think about it, an exclusive programmed, strategy is exactly what Facebook is trying to do with Facebook Watch, where only partner companies can upload video and some are being paid by Facebook to do so. Thus it's not outside the realm of possibility that Facebook could do the same for news.  This kind of members-only approach could keep Facebook out of trouble. It would be an abrupt change, but what if you could only find content on Facebook from an approved set of limited, vetted partners?  This could be seen as a vital, pro-journalism, pro-democracy gesture by Facebook (which, you may recall, has recently had some unwanted meetings with Congress over its anti-democracy impact). And it could keep the company out of more fake news trouble in 2020.  Plus, Murdoch's right. It really wouldn't cost that much. \"Carriage payments would have a minor impact on Facebook's profits,\" he wrote. For a company that pulls in $10 billion-plus in revenue a quarter, a few checks to some newspapers is pocket change for Zuckerberg.  The case against paying is that it makes Facebook a media company  Facebook is by nature open. It's that Silicon Valley utopian ideal that makes Facebook Facebook. Do they really want to change that? \"At our heart we're a tech company,\" COO Sheryl Sandberg told Axios last October.  After all, people like what they like, whether its fake news or mean stories about Trump. Who is Facebook to say they can't share conspiracy theories or the like?  Allison Shelley/Getty Images  Plus, does Facebook want to manage another few hundred publisher relationships on top of what it's doing with Watch? At least with Watch, the promise is hitting Google's YouTube where it hurts and ultimately stealing some TV ad budgets. Watch is a relatively small project (Facebook is spending about $1 billion on it).  Becoming the Internet's curated newsstand (Facebook Read anyone?) is a whole other level. It makes Facebook a media distributor much like Comcast. Which is exactly where it doesn't want to be.  Lastly, paying a select group of publishers probably won't do much for Facebook's bottom line. And that's usually the bottom line.", "stock": "FB"}, {"url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-employee-concerned-company-tracking-phone-for-leaks-report-2018-2", "label": 1, "source": "business-insider", "date": "2018-02-12", "article": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.

Over the past couple of years, the company has had to acknowledge multiple mistakes in its ad metrics. Last fall, researchers even pointed out that Facebook\u2019s purported reach was greater than the US Census population in every state.  So making these kinds of tweaks (and taking other steps to increase transparency) could help restore advertisers\u2019 confidence in the company\u2019s numbers.  Facebook laid out the changes in a blog post, and also at a press event this morning, where Vice President of Marketing Science Brad Smallwood was joined by Edward Gaffney, director of implementation research at ad agency GroupM. (Gaffney is part of Facebook\u2019s Measurement Council.)  The first change comes in the way these metrics will be labelled. Facebook will now explicitly point out when an ad metric is an estimate, in development, or both.  Gaffney said that advertisers are used to working with estimates, but he recalled that even in the Measurement Council, there was some uncertainty around which numbers were estimated versus directly measured. So this kind of clarity is needed \u201cto understand that an estimate is just that \u2014 it\u2019s better than a guess, but it is not the absolute truth.\u201d  Meanwhile, Smallwood said that it\u2019s natural for Facebook to experiment with the most effective ways to present its data. By labeling a measurement as in development, the company is telling advertisers to expect those measurements to change. (As Gaffney put it: \u201cDon\u2019t build a complex model around that.\u201d)  Some of the metrics might eventually disappear entirely if they\u2019re not helpful to advertisers. In fact, Smallwood said Facebook plans to remove 20 of them in July because they were judged redundant, outdated, not actionable or infrequently used.  For example, he said the social reach metric (which shows how often people saw an ad accompanied with context like a comment from their friend) turned out to be not that different from a standard reach metric, and advertisers didn\u2019t know how to use the data to improve their campaigns. So it\u2019s getting cut.  Lastly, Smallwood said Facebook will be launching a new initiative called Measure What Matters, combining in-person events, online events and online content to help advertisers understand more about how to measure and improve their campaigns.", "stock": "FB"}, {"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/01/30/facebook-is-banning-cryptocurrency-and-ico-ads/", "label": 1, "source": "techcrunch", "date": "2018-01-30", "article": "Facebook has a new advertising policy pertaining to cryptocurrency, binary options and initial coin offerings.

By letting them downvote inappropriate comments to hide them. Facebook is now testing a downvote button on a limited set of public Page post comment reels, the company confirms to TechCrunch. But what Facebook does with signals about problematic comments could raise new questions about censorship, and its role as a news editor and media company.  A Facebook spokesperson tells TechCrunch Facebook that the motivation behind the downvote button is to create a lightweight way for people to provide a signal to Facebook that a comment is inappropriate, uncivil, or misleading.  Here\u2019s the statement Facebook provided: \u201cWe are not testing a dislike button. We are exploring a feature for people to give us feedback about comments on public page posts. This is running for a small set of people in the U.S. only.\u201d  This is what the downvote button looks like up close:  When tapped, the downvote button hides a comment, and gives users additional reporting options like \u201cOffensive\u201d, \u201cMisleading\u201d, and \u201cOff Topic\u201d. Those could help Facebook figure out if the comment is objectionable, a form of \u201cfake news\u201d, or just irrelevant. Facebook already has a \u201cHide\u201d button for comments, but it\u2019s usually hidden behind the drop-down arrow on comments rather than immediately clickable.  Here you can see the downvote button on a comment thread, plus what happens when you click it. The screenshots come from Christina Hudler.  According to Facebook, this is a short-term test that doesn\u2019t affect the ranking of the comment, post, or Page. It\u2019s designed as a way to give feedback to Facebook, not the commenter, and there will be no publicly visible count of how many downvotes a comment gets. The test is running for 5% of Android users in the U.S. with language set to English. The downvote button only appears on public Page posts, not on posts by Groups, public figures or users. There\u2019s currently no plan to expand the test as is.  Not A Dislike Button  A dislike button has long been the most requested Facebook feature, but Facebook has never given in.  Back in 2015, CEO Mark Zuckerberg responded to a Q&A question about it, saying:  \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to just build a Dislike button because we don\u2019t want to turn Facebook into a forum where people are voting up or down on people\u2019s posts. That doesn\u2019t seem like the kind of community we want to create.\u201d  Instead, Facebook built the Reactions options that let you respond to posts and comments with love, wow, haha, sad or angry emoji. Facebook also built reactions into Messenger with the option to give messages a thumbs-up or thumbs-down so you could show agreement or disagreement.  But the new downvote button is the closest Facebook has come to actually giving people a dislike button. Downvoting was popularized on Reddit for crowdsourcedcomment ranking. Reddit co-founder Alexi Ohanian weighed in on Facebook\u2019s version via Twitter:  Sincerest form of flattery! Wish I'd trademarked it and \u201cupvote\u201d when came up with it. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 https://t.co/wJMxILChCV \u2014 Alexis Ohanian Sr. (@alexisohanian) February 8, 2018  The downvote button ties in with Facebook\u2019s recent push to enhance its users\u2019 well-being by prioritizing News Feed content that drives meaningful interactions instead of passive, zombie browsing. That led Facebook to show fewer viral videos, which in turn contributed to a 700,000 user decrease in U.S. and Canada daily active users \u2014 its first decline ever anywhere \u2014 and Facebook\u2019s slowest DAU growth rate it\u2019s ever reported.  But one way Facebook could generate more meaningful interaction without losing time on site could be by ensuring the most interesting comments are at the top of posts. Facebook already ranks comments by relevancy based on Likes and replies. But the downvote button could ensure that if objectionable comments rise up and stall discussion, Facebook will know.  That could eventually lead to a way for Facebook to bury these comments, or the people that post them. However, this will only open up more questions about censorship and what qualifies as inappropriate at a time when Facebook is already struggling to manage its responsibilities as what Zuckerberg calls \u201cnot a traditional media company.\u201d", "stock": "FB"}, {"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/01/18/facebook-appoints-american-express-ceo-to-board-of-directors/", "label": 1, "source": "techcrunch", "date": "2018-01-18", "article": "Facebook announced today the addition of Kenneth I.

Quoting tiny fractions suggests content on Facebook gets drowned out in a torrent of information. But the company\u2019s whole business model is based on giving ads and posts prominence in the feeds of well-targeted users.  Questions for Facebook:  Has Facebook performed any analyses that looks at smaller groups of people? If so, can Facebook share them? And how did the ads perform before and after the election?  To what extent did Russia target swing states?  Mr. Mueller\u2019s latest indictment says that, after the middle of 2016, Russians often talked about targeting \u201cpurple states,\u201d or those in which the number of Republican and Democratic voters are close. The indictment also describes the Russians as focused on Florida, which Mr. Trump ended up winning.  \u201cOn or about August 4, 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators created and purchased Facebook advertisements for the \u2018Florida Goes Trump\u2019 rally. The advertisements reached over 59,000 Facebook users in Florida, and over 8,300 Facebook users responded to the advertisements by clicking on it.\u201d  Others have asserted in the past that Russia did not appear to focus its social media efforts on swing states. As Senator Richard Burr, Republican of North Carolina and chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, noted last year:  \u201cWhat you haven\u2019t heard is that almost five times more ads were targeted at Maryland than Wisconsin. Maryland, which was targeted by 262 ads in comparison to Wisconsin\u2019s 55, wasn\u2019t up for grabs; it was a state the Democratic candidate carried by 26 percent.\u201d  Questions for Facebook:  Do the company\u2019s records show that Russia-backed ads and posts reached a higher number of people in certain states or regions of the United States? If so, how responsive were Facebook users in those targeted regions to the Russian posts and ads?  The Russia-backed groups were incredibly successful at gaining followers.  Jonathan Albright, research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia, has done revealing work on Facebook\u2019s Russia-linked pages that is more detailed than anything the company has made public. Mr. Albright\u2019s data, obtained using CrowdTangle, an analytics tool owned by Facebook, shows the speed with which the Russia-backed groups grew.  Blacktivist, a Russia-linked group whose often inflammatory content set it apart from legitimate groups championing African-American rights, had 14,000 followers at the end of 2015. By the time its Facebook page was shut down last year, it had 390,000, according to Mr. Albright\u2019s data \u2014 a hugely successful ramp up that took Blacktivist\u2019s total followers above that for Black Lives Matter. Other Russian-created groups, like Heart of Texas, also showed huge increases in followers.  Questions for Facebook:  How exactly were these groups able to scoop up so many members so quickly? Did the speed of the increases wave any red flags internally at Facebook? To what extent did Facebook\u2019s ad targeting tools, which allow advertisers to reach specific groups of people, enable Russia to put incendiary posts in the feeds of certain groups? And one from Mr. Albright: What were the follower totals and other data for any private Facebook pages that were backed by the Russians?  Why this issue isn\u2019t going away for Facebook.  It may well be the case that Russian disinformation did not swing the election for Mr. Trump. But it may have had far more of an impact than the public knows. And Facebook is almost certainly sitting on data that could deepen the nation\u2019s understanding of what went on.  \u201cI can\u2019t imagine what it would it look like if we had all the data,\u201d Mr. Albright said.", "stock": "FB"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/19/technology/russia-facebook-trump.html", "label": -1, "source": "the-new-york-times", "date": "2018-02-19", "article": "Now, Facebook is in the uncomfortable position of reining in an off-message executive, while clarifying that it didn\u2019t mean to bolster the president\u2019s position.  \u201cThe special counsel has issued its indictments, and nothing we found contradicts their conclusions,\u201d Joel Kaplan, Facebook\u2019s vice president of global policy, said in a statement. \u201cAny suggestion otherwise is wrong.\u201d  Photo  Mr. Goldman did not respond to requests for comment, and the company declined to make him available for an interview.  It is Facebook\u2019s right to defend itself, of course. The company has faced a raft of accusations of wrongdoing, some of which have indeed been overblown. Facebook was not the only social network manipulated by Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency, the company at the heart of Mr. Mueller\u2019s indictment. And other companies, such as Twitter and YouTube, certainly share the blame for fostering a media ecosystem in which false news and propaganda can flourish.  But Mr. Goldman\u2019s tweetstorm was unintentionally revealing. It showed that, years after hostile foreign actors first began using Facebook to wage an information war against the American public, some high-ranking officials within the company still don\u2019t understand just how central Facebook was to Russia\u2019s misinformation campaign, and how consequential the company\u2019s mistakes have been.

Even before Mr. Goldman\u2019s tweets were blasted along to Mr. Trump\u2019s 48 million followers, they lacked crucial context about what exactly Mr. Mueller\u2019s investigation had found.

He claimed that swinging the election in Mr. Trump\u2019s favor was not a primary goal of Russia\u2019s Facebook campaign, when Mr. Mueller\u2019s indictment had just concluded that it was.

Why is educating citizens about digital literacy the solution to misinformation, as Mr. Goldman suggested, rather than fixing the tech platforms that make misinformation hard to distinguish from truth? Why should it reassure us that most of Russia\u2019s Facebook advertising was purchased after the election, rather than telling us that Facebook continued to drop the ball even after it knew it had a Russia problem?  More than anything, the details contained in the indictment make clear how vulnerable Facebook still is to a hostile actor. None of the safeguards it has announced so far \u2014 such as providing more transparency about political ads, or using snail-mail postcards to verify the identities of certain political advertisers \u2014 would stop a sophisticated and well-funded foreign influence operation. And many of the tactics the Internet Research Agency used in 2016 \u2014 including posing as American citizens to create large partisan Facebook pages and organizing offline rallies with the help of American co-conspirators \u2014 would be just as effective today.  In a recent cover story, Wired detailed the soul-searching journey that Facebook\u2019s executives have undertaken since the 2016 election. First, they denied that they\u2019d done anything wrong. Then, after the scope of Russia\u2019s misinformation campaign became clear, they circled the wagons to protect the company\u2019s reputation and appease its critics. Only recently have certain executives, like Mark Zuckerberg, its chief executive, come to appreciate the scale and scope of Facebook\u2019s errors, and publicly accept responsibility for them.  We may never get answers about what Facebook knew of the Russian interference campaign in 2016, and why it didn\u2019t act more forcefully to stop it. (Trust me, I\u2019ve tried.) But it\u2019s deeply troubling that eight months before the 2018 midterms, as malicious forces continue to use social media to sow discord and meddle in elections all over the world, some at Facebook seem more interested in defending themselves from criticism than owning their mistakes, fixing their platform\u2019s problems and protecting our democracy.", "stock": "FB"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/01/briefing/secret-memo-winter-games-facebook.html", "label": -1, "source": "the-new-york-times", "date": "2018-02-01", "article": "Separately, White House officials left the details of the president\u2019s $1.5 trillion infrastructure plan to Congress.

Photo  Back Story  On this day in 1887, Harvey Wilcox, a real estate developer from Kansas, filed a plan with Los Angeles County for a small, gridded subdivision that he called Hollywood. (The origin of the name is a subject of dispute.)  Over the next decade, Mr. Wilcox and his wife, Daeida, conjured out of the desert a strict Christian community of orchards and Victorian cottages, connected to Los Angeles by a lone streetcar line.  Photo  There were just a few hundred residents, and the hamlet banned alcohol, bowling alleys and even, briefly, movie theaters. But in 1910, Hollywood voted to merge with Los Angeles.  Soon, movie studios fled the enforcement of Thomas Edison\u2019s monopoly on film patents and started setting up in the ideal Southern California light.  In 1923, the Hollywoodland sign went up (it was truncated to Hollywood in 1949). The original sign was an illuminated billboard for a segregated housing development that called itself a fortress against \u201cmetropolitanism\u201d; one ad urged, \u201cProtect your family.\u201d  The sign was left up as the so-called Golden Age of Hollywood arrived, a noirish era embodied by the starlet Peg Entwistle, who jumped to her death from the H in 1932.

Just as with the Snapdragon 835 VR Developer Kit, the Snapdragon 845 Mobile VR Reference Design's purpose is to provide a starting point from which other manufacturers can develop their own unique headsets. It's not a consumer product you'll see on store shelves.  Last year, Google, Facebook, Lenovo, HTC Vive and others announced headsets based on the Snapdragon 835 reference design. These include the now-official Lenovo Solo Mirage and China-exclusive HTC Vive Focus.  In 2018, expect many of these same companies to develop new standalone headsets based on Qualcomm's Snapdragon 845 design, with likely releases later in the year.  Qualcomm is also announcing a new smartphone reference design headset, which will support 2018's flagship phones that sport the Snapdragon 845 chipset. While Hugo Swart, Head of Virtual and Augmented Reality Business Group, Qualcomm Technologies, Inc., wouldn't name names during a conversation with TechRadar, he did say these include phones to be announced at MWC 2018.  The Samsung Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9 Plus are due to launch when the show gets underway next week, so we wouldn't be surprised to see the phones slotted into Qualcomm's headset at some point.  Image 1 of 3 Side view of the Snapdragon 845 reference design headset Image 2 of 3 Side view of the Snapdragon 845 reference design headset Image 3 of 3 Top view of the Snapdragon 845 reference design headset  Breathing fire into mobile VR  Qualcomm is continuing to put its chips (literally) on mobile as the future of consumer VR adoption, as opposed to tethered systems that require an expensive PC set up.  \"We see that mobile VR is the form factor that will take the technology to the masses,\" Swart told us.  The Snapdragon 845 VR headset brings with it all the standout features of the new chipset, including 30% faster graphics performance, 30% better power efficiency, and double the display throughput compared to the 835.  What's more, Swart said that with the Snapdragon 845, VR headsets can support 2K x 2K displays per eye.  An exciting addition to this year's reference design is room-scale six degrees of freedom (6DoF) tracking. This means that in addition to tracking your body, the headset will also track objects in the real world and bring them into the virtual world without the need for external sensors.  In practical terms, this means the headset will detect a real-life table in front of you, track it in relation to the environment you're in, and make sure you don't run into it. The table can also be brought into the virtual experience, being represented as, say, a rock that'd you also want to avoid.  Room-scale 6DoF is achievable thanks to the implementation of a technique called Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) on the 845. The Snapdragon 845 can do SLAM because it has \"a whole lot more horsepower\", Swart said.  That extra horsepower comes from a dedicated signal processor (DSP) in the chip. While the 835 had a DSP, the 845 now has a dedicated computational DSP on which to run SLAM, Swart explained.  Robust tracking is most often associated with tethered headsets, like the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive, which also rely on external sensors. For Qualcomm's mobile reference design to include room-scale tracking speaks the headset's capabilities (though we can't speak to quality just yet).  More information on the Snapdragon 845 VR headset's specs, price and availability will be announced at GDC 2018 in March.  The next wave  The design and build of the Snapdragon 845 headset isn't much different from the one prior, but that's to be expected. Qualcomm is simply providing the core functionality for mobile VR headsets, while manufacturers take the design and make it their own.  It's a strategy that seems to be working well for Qualcomm as new headsets come to market more quickly and more partners sign on; Swart cited 12 additional hardware manufacturers that said in November 2017 they would build headsets based on Qualcomm's reference design.  \"The proof point is that this strategy we have is bearing fruit, with the acceptance and the endorsement and the usage of Google, Facebook and Vive,\" Swart added.  The Snapdragon 845 VR headset sounds to be a step above what the 835 version could do. This should mean good things for mobile VR in 2018, and a new wave of improved headsets on the horizon. Just how improved, though, we'll have to wait and see.", "stock": "FB"}, {"url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/zuckerberg-apologizes-for-facebook-privacy-breach-in-full-page-newspaper-ads", "label": -1, "source": "techradar", "date": "2018-03-26", "article": "It took a while, but Mark Zuckerberg broke his silence on the Cambridge Analytica scandal a few days ago and posted a response on his Facebook page saying, \"We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you.\"  While the online response didn\u2019t quite sound like an apology, the social media giant has moved offline to do just that.

It its entirety. https://t.co/bd0qkkXGgN pic.twitter.com/oUvTZLNiyB \u2014 Alex Kantrowitz (@Kantrowitz) January 23, 2018  As reported by BuzzFeed News, Facebook has a \"trusted\" news source survey that consists of two simple questions: \"Do you recognize the following websites?\" and \"How much do you trust each of these domains?\" For the first one, the answers you can provide are a simple \"yes\" or \"no,\" while the latter gives you the options to reply with \"entirely,\" \"a lot,\" \"somewhat,\" \"barely\" or \"not at all.\" That doesn't seem like the best or most thorough way to judge editorial integrity. Not only that, but the survey doesn't take into account personal biases, leaving the system wide open to abuse. This is only going to encourage people to continue to live in a bubble of their own creation, where there's no room for information or opinions that challenge their worldview.  Facebook seems to think the benefit to its survey is that it's simple and straightforward, though that's actually why it's so misguided. There's no room for nuance or additional context. How many people will say they don't trust the New York Times or CNN simply because President Donald Trump calls them \"Fake News\" any chance he gets? Sure, those particular outlets shouldn't have any problem being recognized as legit, but even labeling them as such doesn't seem like it's a responsibility Facebook's willing to take on. A Facebook spokesperson said to Engadget that Facebook is a platform for people to \"gain access to an ideologically diverse set of views,\" adding the following:  We surveyed a vast, broadly representative range of people (which helps -- among other measures -- to prevent the gaming-of-the-system or abuse issue you noted) within our Facebook community to develop the roadmap to these changes -- changes that are not intended to directly impact any specific groups of publishers based on their size or ideological leanings. Instead, we are making a change so that people can have more from their favorite sources and more from trusted sources. I'd also add that this is one of many signals that go into News Feed ranking. We do not plan to release individual publishers' trust scores because they represent an incomplete picture of how each story's position in each person's feed is determined.  \"There's too much sensationalism, misinformation and polarization in the world today,\" Zuckerberg said in Facebook post announcing the News Feed changes. \"Social media enables people to spread information faster than ever before, and if we don't specifically tackle these problems, then we end up amplifying them. That's why it's important that News Feed promotes high quality news that helps build a sense of common ground.\"  The problem is that, by letting its users control how the system works, Facebook may actually end up amplifying the fake news bubble it helped create. Facebook users were instrumental in the spreading of misinformation and Russian propaganda during the 2016 US Presidential election. According to its own data over 125 million Americans had been exposed to Kremlin-sponsored pages on Facebook.  \"The hard question we've struggled with is how to decide what news sources are broadly trusted in a world with so much division,\" Zuckerberg added. He said that Facebook could try to make that decision itself, but that \"that's not something we're comfortable with.\"", "stock": "FB"}, {"url": "https://www.engadget.com/2018/01/16/facebook-will-make-messenger-less-clunky/", "label": -1, "source": "engadget", "date": "2018-01-16", "article": "Facebook is also prioritizing visual messaging, from further investment in real-time video to improving GIF, sticker and image options within Messenger.

Investors are apparently shocked that big tech companies that have long received political protection from liberals are suddenly getting the Big Oil rubdown.  Over the weekend two newspapers reported that the political firm Cambridge Analytica harvested data from 50 million Facebook users by using a personality test app. Ted Cruz used the firm in 2015 to target voters, and the Trump campaign later marshalled its \u201cpsychographic\u201d modelling\u2014a meld of social science and psychology.  The Obama campaign pioneered using Facebook data to boost turnout. Facebook itself exploits personal information, and its data trove is why it captures nearly 20% of the digital advertising market. But Cambridge Analytica may have misrepresented its purpose to users and Facebook, a violation of the platform\u2019s policy. Politicians are outraged nonetheless. During the Obama years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies enjoyed a halo effect. But since Donald Trump\u2019s election, Democrats have discovered that tech can be used for malicious purposes\u2014such as helping Donald Trump. Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar and California Rep. Adam Schiff have called for an investigation of Facebook data controls, and more political scrutiny is sure to come. This week the Senate is expected to pass legislation that would allow trial lawyers and state attorneys general to charge internet companies for allegedly abetting sex-trafficking. This represents an erosion of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which shields companies like Facebook and Google from liability for crimes committed by their users. It\u2019s only a matter of time before other crimes are exempted from Section 230. Mr. Trump is no fan of Big Tech, so watch out if Democrats win Congress. The European Commission this week also plans to propose a tax on digital ad revenue and the sale of digital data to third parties. This could slam U.S. tech profits, especially if lawmakers in Washington follow.

Photo: Ng Han Guan/Associated Press  Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has made China a priority. Last week, in a move widely seen as a possible back door into China for the Silicon Valley company, Facebook joined with Beijing-based smartphone company Xiaomi Corp. to launch a new virtual-reality headset called Mi VR Standalone, modeled after Facebook\u2019s Oculus Go.  Ms. Moser, a U.S. citizen born in China, was hired to help build face-to-face relations with government officials. Before joining Facebook, Ms. Moser spent more than a decade at Intel Corp. in China, where former colleagues said she helped Intel build a $2.5 billion factory.  In a 2011 essay, she called arranging meetings with Chinese officials a \u201clong, trivial and pressing\u201d task. She had some successes at Facebook, joining Mr. Zuckerberg for a meeting with Lu Wei, then China\u2019s top internet regulator, at Facebook headquarters in late 2014.  She also accompanied Mr. Zuckerberg in March 2016 to Beijing meetings with Mr. Lu and the Communist Party\u2019s ideology chief Liu Yunshan.  William Shuai, a former government official who Ms. Moser hired away from LinkedIn Corp.\u2019s China operations in September, has assumed her duties for now, according to one person familiar with the situation.

Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images  Members of Congress took turns lashing Mark Zuckerberg this week for Facebook \u2019s myriad screw-ups. The CEO showed contrition, but his apologia has raised important questions about the government\u2019s failures.  Democrats who were once enthralled with Silicon Valley fell out of love with Facebook following reports that Russian trolls used its platform to promulgate fake news and ads to support Donald Trump in 2016. Then came news that a political firm linked to the Trump campaign may have misappropriated data on 270,000 users and their 87 million friends collected by a third-party app.  Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s defense? Facebook was too \u201ctrusting.\u201d After the Guardian newspaper reported in 2015 that a Cambridge University researcher had shared data from his personality-quiz app with the political firm Cambridge Analytica , Facebook asked Cambridge Analytica to delete the data. Cambridge Analytica said it had, and Facebook accepted its word.  The incident demonstrated that Facebook\u2019s privacy protections were flimsier than it claimed. In 2011 Facebook settled charges with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) over mishandling user data, and Facebook agreed to establish stronger privacy protections and obtain periodic third-party audits. But Facebook has now disclosed that tens of thousands of apps may have obtained data on users and their friends beyond what they needed to operate.  This seems to violate the FTC\u2019s consent decree, as Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal noted. Mr. Zuckerberg waffled in reply that \u201cit certainly appears that we should have been aware that [the researcher] submitted a term that was in conflict with the rules of the platform.\u201d But he said the third-party audits didn\u2019t turn up problems.  The FTC is now investigating Facebook\u2019s privacy controls, but a few questions: Why didn\u2019t the commission ensure years ago that Facebook had established policies to prevent third-party apps from repurposing data? Was the agency too trusting? The Obama campaign app in 2012 exploited data from users and their friends. This may also have violated the FTC consent decree, especially if it shared the data with other liberal groups. Did political considerations influence the FTC\u2019s lax oversight?  These are important questions since Democrats are pressing for more stringent privacy regulations, which Mr. Zuckerberg said he\u2019s open to. But regulation typically benefits incumbents like Facebook that can afford to spend more on compliance while tripping up small competitors. Before establishing new regulations, the FTC should ensure that tech companies abide by their own policies.  Mr. Zuckerberg was also keelhauled for letting Russians exploit the platform in 2016. Facebook has since identified 470 pages and accounts linked to the Russian-controlled Internet Research Agency, which generated at least 200,000 pieces of content over two years. The Russian outfit also bought 3,000 ads on Facebook and Instagram.  The spread of fake news was partly due to Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s refusal to exercise editorial control over content or pay for quality news. Employing people to sift out junk is expensive, though the increased regulation that may come if he doesn\u2019t also isn\u2019t cheap.  But Facebook can\u2019t be held entirely responsible for Russia\u2019s interference. Only the Justice Department can see across media channels and has the power to investigate election fraud, as special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s indictment of 13 Russians in February showed.  The Russians began organizing in 2013 and stole American identities. \u201cBeginning in or around June 2014, and continuing into June 2015, public reporting began to identify operations conducted by the [IRA] in the United States,\u201d the indictment says. The Russian operatives also created fake accounts on Twitter and YouTube. Yet the Obama Administration waited until December 2016 to slap sanctions on Russians for hacking Democratic National Committee emails. It doesn\u2019t appear that social- media interference was ever a priority.  While Facebook has endorsed legislation that would require more disclosure for buyers of political ads, the regulatory burden could make it harder for small companies and blogs to sell ads. This could drive more political advertising to Facebook. And it\u2019s unclear how the legislation would prevent identity fraud.  Democrats are bitter that President Trump won the election and are using Facebook as a scapegoat. Facebook is hardly blameless, but neither is the Obama Administration.", "stock": "FB"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/instagram-is-turning-into-facebook-and-thats-bad-1517422670", "label": 1, "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "date": "2018-01-31", "article": "Instagram, left, and Facebook, right, used to feel like two distinct digital experiences, but they feel increasingly similar as Instagram adopts Facebook-style recommendations and notifications.

On Facebook, I share major life changes and links to articles I\u2019ve written. But that long, emotional post from the refugee camp in Greece where I volunteered? Or the picture where I\u2019m dressed up as the late Chicago Cubs announcer Harry Caray for Halloween? Instagram all the way.  Facebook Inc. has owned Instagram since 2012 but until recently the social network and the photo-sharing app have felt like distinct experiences. For years, Instagram was a haven from Facebook\u2019s annoying ads, creepy friend suggestions and viral clickbait. Meanwhile, Facebook has begun to draw fire as a potential menace to mental health and stable democracies alike.  So it\u2019s a little surprising that recent Instagram updates make it feel much more like its big brother. Sure, when Instagram has taken a page from Facebook\u2019s playbook in the past, it has paid off: Switching from a chronological feed to an algorithm increased engagement.  And Instagram\u2019s user base continues to grow. Monthly active users doubled to 800 million from February to September last year; the app had 500 million daily active users as of September.  But lately even Instagram\u2019s owner has acknowledged the distinction between a habitual user and a happy user. The latest updates may get people into Instagram more frequently, or for a longer time, but there\u2019s little to enjoy about them. Here\u2019s why I\u2019m falling out of love with one of my favorite apps.  Recommended Garbage  Part of what made Instagram great was that your main feed was a stream of things you wanted to see: pictures and videos from friends and accounts whose posts you enjoy. The Facebook-type noise\u2014stuff your friends had commented on, public chatter\u2014remained in other tabs you could click over to if you felt like it.  A few weeks ago, I was scrolling through Instagram, minding my own business, when a random picture of a man showed up, posted by an account I\u2019d never heard of. For a split second, I thought I was in someone else\u2019s account.  Photo: The Wall Street Journal  Starting in December, Instagram has been putting posts from people you don\u2019t follow right into your feed, under a \u201cRecommended for you\u201d banner.  They are sandwiched between your feed\u2019s new posts and previously viewed ones. If you tap the three dots on the right side of the banner, you can hide these posts temporarily, but you can\u2019t opt out of them entirely.  An Instagram spokeswoman said the feature \u201cmakes it easier to find relevant, high-quality content and accounts you wouldn\u2019t normally see but might enjoy.\u201d  Research has shown that when we see Facebook content from people we don\u2019t know, it can enhance the feeling that others are living better lives. One study found that when people used Facebook passively\u2014scrolling but not commenting, liking or posting\u2014their feelings of envy increased.  Even Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has weighed in: He recently told investors he wants the company \u201cto encourage meaningful social interactions.\u201d Instagram\u2019s recommended posts are the opposite of meaningful.  Post, Post, Ad  I can now make it through three new posts on Instagram before seeing an ad. After that, I get one every six to eight posts.  Instagram\u2019s spokeswoman confirmed ad load is up: \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to do this by improving the quality and the relevance of the ads.\u201d  But the ad load feels way up. According to the social advertising firm Brand Networks, clients delivered 17 times as many ad impressions on Instagram in 2017 as in 2016. The company, which works with brands including American Express Co. and Unilever PLC, expects Instagram impressions to grow by 25% in the first quarter of 2018, compared with the previous quarter.  Instagram may be free, but you\u2019re paying for it with your constantly interrupted attention.  Nowhere to Hide  Earlier this month, Instagram\u2019s direct messages started showing when users were last active.  Photo: The Wall Street Journal  While a lot of people are fine with such a feature\u2014closely related to the instant-message read receipt\u2014others feel it is intrusive. You can disable the feature in settings, but it\u2019s on by default.  The Instagram spokeswoman says the feature allows for \u201cmore of a real-time experience.\u201d  People reeled when Facebook made them download a separate Messenger app, which has since become larded up with too many such real-time features. That may be a harbinger of things to come for Instagram, which is testing a stand-alone camera-first messaging app in six countries outside the U.S.  People You Don\u2019t Want to Know  Facebook\u2019s \u201cPeople you may know\u201d feature, which suggests who you might want to friend, is known for being creepy. Facebook says suggestions are drawn from mutual friends, your networks and contacts you\u2019ve uploaded, among other criteria.  Instagram shares information with Facebook, and it turns out its follow suggestions are just as creepy.  How creepy? I created a fresh Instagram account with my work email and didn\u2019t sync it to Facebook. Still, 78 out of 100 recommendations were my Facebook friends.  The other 22 names were even more interesting. They looked like strangers. But you can get linked to people\u2014even borderline strangers\u2014who saved your email or phone number and synced their contacts to Facebook, which they\u2019ve linked to their Instagram. One of my suggested friends was an apartment broker I\u2019d emailed through Craigslist... in 2009. (Gizmodo actually built a People You May Know Inspector so you can study Facebook\u2019s seemingly mysterious links.)  Even when you don\u2019t upload your contacts directly to Instagram, the network uses information\u2014or \u201csignals,\u201d as Instagram calls them\u2014from Facebook, which might include contacts or other tangential information.  No Mo\u2019 Notifications  Now is not a bad time to go through your notification settings. Did you know that Instagram has 17 categories? Among them are notifications about which Facebook friends use Instagram. If you don\u2019t want to be bugged constantly about adding them, you can turn this off. Just remember: This won\u2019t stop Instagram from telling your Facebook friends that you\u2019re on the app.  You might want to shut off other notifications too, such as the one that says someone is posting for the first time in a while, or my personal favorite, the one that reminds you that you have unseen notifications.  On top of that, Facebook, Instagram and Messenger have been testing a cross-platform notification feature, which lets users see all alerts and hop between the apps.  I understand why Instagram is adopting Facebook features: They work. But for years I logged into Instagram and enjoyed it more than Facebook.

REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo  The company, which also reported better-than-expected quarterly results, is reaping the benefits from the launch of its Volta chip architecture last year. Volta processors power a range of technologies such as artificial intelligence and driverless cars.  \u201cVirtually every internet and cloud service provider has embraced our Volta GPUs,\u201d Nvidia\u2019s Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said in a statement.  Graphic chips were initially developed to handle graphics for high end video games and other computers. These chips help share the processing load from the main chip, making it easier and faster to run high end applications.  These chips are now being widely use in new technologies, like artificial intelligence, machine learning.  Revenue from Nvidia\u2019s widely watched data center business, which counts Microsoft Corp\u2019s (MSFT.O) Azure cloud business as its customer, more than doubled to $606 million.  That trounced analysts\u2019 average estimate of $541.1 million.  Nvidia also sells chips to Amazon.com Inc\u2019s (AMZN.O) Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is dueling with Microsoft to handle data and computing for large enterprises  Data center should continue to grow pretty nicely into calendar 2018 and beyond, Morningstar analyst Abhinav Davuluri said.  The boom in cryptocurrencies is also powering demand for chips from Nvidia and rival AMD (AMD.O) as they provide the high computing ability required for cryptocurrency \u201cmining.\u201d  \u201cStrong demand in the cryptocurrency market exceeded our expectations,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said on a conference call.  \u201cWhile the overall contribution of cryptocurrency to our business remains difficult to quantify, we believe it was a higher percentage of revenue than the prior quarter.\u201d  The company said inventory levels of its gaming GPUs throughout the quarter was lower than historical channel inventory levels due to surging demand from cryptocurrency miners.  The price of Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, rose more than 1,300 percent in 2017. Prices have, however, dropped about 40 percent this year.  Nvidia\u2019s revenue from gaming, for which it is best known, rose 29 percent to $1.74 billion, accounting for a more than half of its total revenue in the fourth quarter, and also beating analysts\u2019 estimate of $1.59 billion.  The company forecast current-quarter revenue of $2.90 billion, plus or minus 2 percent, well above the analysts\u2019 average estimate of $2.47 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Net income rose to $1.12 billion, or $1.78 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Jan. 28 from $655 million, or 99 cents per share, a year earlier.  Results include a $133 million gain related to the new U.S. tax law.  Total revenue rose 34 percent to $2.91 billion, topping estimate of $2.69 billion.  Excluding items, the company said it earned $1.72 per share.  Nvidia earned $1.57 per share, excluding the tax benefit, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, beating estimate of $1.17.

How\u2019d Zuck Do?  The early market gains from Xi\u2019s trade-war-soothing keynote held, for the most part, and accelerated once Zuckerberg took the stage at the first of two congressional hearings. The response was overwhelmingly positive to his cool, calm, and collected demeanor, as traders bid up Facebook (FB +4.5%) and the rest of the tech space (S5INFT +2.2%). Here\u2019s what the Street had to say about the performance:  Evercore ISI analyst Anthony DiClemente, who rates FB an outperform, said Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony was \"sometimes tedious, other times repetitive, but mostly -- and this is a good thing -- uneventful\"; he added that Zuckerberg delivered balanced and reasonable answers to questions and \"seemed to strike the right tone\" as he found plenty of common ground with the lawmakers; DiClemente saw little in the testimony that should negatively impact investors\u2019 view of Facebook\u2019s long-term growth and business opportunity  Suntrust analyst Youssef Squali, who rates FB a buy, said that while no major news emerged from the testimony, \"we believe that this is a seminal event, one that\u2019s likely to lead to increased regulation (a la GDPR)\" that should still favor larger platforms like FB and GOOGL in the end  Big Move, But Still Range Bound  Energy stocks had the best day of all (S5ENRS +3.3%, biggest upside move since Nov. 2016) thanks to a continuation of the rip in crude prices. The sector has been the big winner so far in April while the defensive sectors, like utilities and REITs, and the industrials (blame Brent oil\u2019s surge through $70/bbl for weakness in the airlines) have been clear laggards.  The market\u2019s move to the upside was on relatively decent volumes too. They were the second highest on the consolidated tape this month, and a major bounce back from Monday, where we saw the second lowest number all year.  We closed near the high end of the S&P\u2019s recent range, just shy of resistance at ~2,660 (while support still holds at the 200-day moving average of ~2,596) and we could see further optimism creep back into the market if we can break above this mark.  Excuses to Fade the Rally  But something we\u2019ve become accustomed to lately is these huge swings to the upside followed by swift plunges in the opposite direction, so it\u2019s altogether possible that investors will be looking for any excuse to fade yesterday\u2019s move.  Perhaps day two of Zuckerberg\u2019s grilling (scheduled for 10am) doesn\u2019t elicit the same response as day one, and the FAANGs, the semis, and the rest of tech fade hard -- Goldman is already out slashing estimates on chip darling NVDA and sell-rated AMD, with both stocks down ~1% in pre-market trading.  Maybe the latest headlines tied to Mueller, or the Cohen raid, or possible action in Syria will spill over into the market. Or perhaps a scorching hot CPI print (today at 8:30am), after yesterday\u2019s firmer-than-expected PPI, and some eyebrow-raising language in the FOMC Minutes (at 2pm) might help to spook the tape.  Watch the BKX for clues as we\u2019re only two days away from the kickoff to bank earnings. And as for tech\u2019s next major non-Facebook catalyst, it\u2019ll be NFLX\u2019s earnings on Monday after the close. The sell-side has been aggressively bumping up numbers over the past few days, so expectations are riding high: Morgan Stanley yesterday gave bull case $440 on higher conviction, Goldman today raised price target to $360 on a likely beat, and many others making similar tweaks to their models.

The company will likely beat earnings expectations because of the cryptocurrency boost, but investors will be looking for a big beat to move shares higher.  Watch Nvidia trade in real time here.    Cryptocurrencies have provided Nvidia, and other chipmakers, with a big boost to their top line in recent quarters.  Crypto miners have been buying up huge swaths of GPUs as the prices of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies skyrocketed. The huge demand drained Nvidia's supply chains and sent the prices of the cards soaring in secondary markets. All of this extra demand is estimated to have boosted Nvidia's revenue in the fourth quarter, but that leaves Nvidia with a big problem as it looks to report earnings on Thursday.  \"We think the Company will need to see material Outperformance to see appreciation on the print (largely due to near-term run-up),\" Mitch Steves, an analyst at RBC, said in a note to clients on Tuesday.  Steves is saying that the extra demand for GPUs has sent shares of Nvidia higher recently, which will make it hard for the company to impress investors when it reports fourth-quarter earnings. The company can't just report overall revenue growth, it will have to show that it's growing revenue outside of its graphics division because the boost from crypto could eventually disappear as prices of cryptocurrencies fluctuate and interest wanes.  AMD, Nvidia's main rival in the GPU space, saw its shares plummet about 6% immediately after reporting an across-the-board beat on earnings. AMD said it got a 5-6% boost in annual revenue in 2017, and said about 1/3 of its growth in its graphics and computing division was from increased GPU demand from cryptocurrencies, which wasn't enough for investors watching the earnings. Shares of AMD did rebound though, and the company is up 4.08% this year.  Because of the recent runs higher, some analysts have dialed back their enthusiasm for the stock. Citron Research and Goldman Sachs both recently expressed concerns over how much Nvidia has risen over the past year because of enthusiasm around crypto demand, leading Citron to lower its price target and Goldman to remove the stock from its conviction list. Both firms are still bullish on Nvidia in the long term.  Steves thinks new data center chips will revitalize growth in that unit. Nvidia is also working on more partnerships for its autonomous driving chips that should improve sales as more automakers release cars with self-driving capabilities, even if they are initially limited. These two units are potential growth areas that Nvidia could highlight in its earnings to show it's not just a crypto mining company.  Steves has a $250 price target for Nvidia ahead of earnings, and rates the company an outperform.

He\u2019s speaking of the keynote address he intends to give at the company\u2019s upcoming GTC conference. Held in San Jose, miles away from the company\u2019s new imposing headquarters, Nvidia is set to host thousands of attendees from the world\u2019s top artificial intelligence, automotive and gaming companies. To Huang, his address needs to inspire and entertain. That should be easy. He\u2019s naturally inspiring and entertaining.  Huang has risen to the elite among Silicon Valley\u2019s visionary leaders. Scores of reports show Nvidia employees love working for him and his addresses are often technical yet accessible. He commands an audience through his passion for the technology his company is creating.  He\u2019s been at the helm of Nvidia since co-founding the company at age 30 in 1993 and has led Nvidia from the maker of computer graphics cards to become the premier platform for artificial intelligence and machine learning. This positions Nvidia at the forefront as the computing industry contemplates a fundamental shift in processing.  Nvidia saw it coming.  In 2008 and 2009 researchers started using GPUs made by Nvidia and AMD to handle work typically performed by microprocessors. The parallel computing processors built into graphics cards made by these two companies offered distinct advantages over the X86 platform championed by Intel. At the time Nvidia was pushing hard into mobile and computing graphics, but several years earlier the company started heavily investing in designing graphics chips to handle non-graphical functions. The industry noticed, and Nvidia made a play for supercomputers.  Now, nearly ten years later, Nvidia\u2019s products are among the fastest and most efficient supercomputing platforms available. Nvidia is set to, literally, power the computing world.  \u201cWe\u2019ve been pioneering this computing approach called GPU computing for over the last decade,\u201d Jensen said. \u201cOver the last seven or eight years, it really went into turbo charge because the model is perfect for artificial intelligence.\u201d  He explained that Nvidia watched the GTC conference explode in popularity with over 22,000 attendees last year. Because of this, at this year\u2019s show, he says, every major artificial intelligence and car company will be there along with every major university. In short, this show has become the largest gathering of machine learning researchers and technologists.  The show, like most company-sponsored events, is primarily to demonstrate the capabilities of Nvidia\u2019s platforms, most of which are aimed at machine learning. With this comes developments in self-driving cars, robotics and, of course, computer graphics. Jensen stressed, in the end, Nvidia is a computer tools company, and he hopes to inspire developers with new tools and by tapping into discoveries made by other researchers.  Nvidia is soaring right now, and there\u2019s a lot to celebrate. Its stock is hovering around its all-time high of $242 up from the mid-teens in 2009, the year of the first GTC conference. The company\u2019s value of $141 billion surpassed IBM\u2019s and is sneaking up on Oracle and Cisco. Even with increasing competition, Nvidia is managing to hold onto its considerable GPU, but supply issues continue to challenge Nvidia.  Operators of distributed ledgers and cryptocurrency mining efforts favor the parallel processing found in GPUs and Nvidia\u2019s products are among the most popular in this market. This popularity has created a significant shortage of graphics cards resulting in developers and gamers often being unable to purchase the latest product from Nvidia. I asked Huang about this supply problem.  \u201cWe\u2019re sold out of many of our high-end SKUs, and so it\u2019s a real challenge keeping [graphic cards] in the marketplace for games,\u201d he said, adding \u201cAt the highest level the way to think about that is because of the philosophy of cryptocurrency \u2014 which is really about taking advantage of distributed high-performance computing \u2014 there are supercomputers in the hands of almost everybody in the world so that no singular force or entity that can control the currency.\u201d  It\u2019s about distributed control, he said, and touted the notion that Nvidia GPUs are the world\u2019s largest installed base of distributed computers, though he still attributes crypto\u2019s demands as a small percentage of Nvidia\u2019s overall business.  \u201cThis still doesn\u2019t change the fact that I\u2019m frustrated so many developers and gamers around the world cannot get access to their GeForces,\u201d Huang said.  So what is he going to do about it? \u201cWe have to build a whole lot more,\u201d he said. \u201cThe video supply chain is working really hard, and you know all of our partners are working around the clock. We\u2019ve got to come closer to the demand of the market. And right now, we\u2019re not anywhere near close to that and so we\u2019re just going to have to keep running.\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s a good problem to have,\u201d Huang said in a more upbeat tone. \u201cI still wish that we can put more GPUs in the hands of gamers that want to play PUBG.\u201d  And Huang has every reason to be upbeat. His company is racing towards a conclusion that could result in the most significant paradigm shift in computing in decades. Parallel processing units will likely power advanced artificial intelligence which is key to self-driving cars and significant research products in healthcare, climate, and next-generation transportation.  Challenges abound, and the future isn\u2019t guaranteed for Nvidia. The company has to keep pushing deeper into critical markets, get ahead of supply issues and keep courting developers and researchers onto its platforms \u2014 but those are issues for another day. On the eve of GTC 2019 Jensen Huang seems to have a more immediate goal: deliver a rousing keynote address.

Earlier on Tuesday, Reuters broke the news that Nvidia was suspending its own autonomous testing programs around the world. Huang didn\u2019t address the suspension on stage, but he did express sympathy for the victim during the keynote, which he reiterated during the Q&A.  \u201cFirst of all, what happened is tragic and sad,\u201d Huang said in response to a question about whether he believes the accident might impact appetite among other companies for developing autonomous technologies. \u201cIt also is a reminder of exactly why we\u2019re doing this.\u201d  Huang explained that in fact, as a result of the accident, he actually believes that investment will rise in self-driving system design, specifically because previously companies might have thought they could get away with meager or minimal investment in those areas, and instead will be realizing it\u2019s the one area where they can\u2019t compromise in favor of attempting to lower costs.  \u201cI think that the world is going to, as a result, be much more serious about investing in development systems, which is good,\u201d he said.  Meanwhile, Huang also urged caution regarding anyone being too quick to judge Uber\u2019s engineers or their intentions and diligence.

So it\u2019s something we take incredibly seriously.\u201d  He added that the reason for the suspension was \u201csimple,\u201d since the accident means that there\u2019s now \u201ca new data point\u201d that has to be taken into consideration, and as \u201cgood engineers,\u201d Nvidia must \u201cwait to see what we can learn from the incident\u201d before continuing testing activities.", "stock": "NVDA"}, {"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/03/27/nvidia-debuts-new-drive-constellation-simulated-self-driving-test-system/", "label": -1, "source": "techcrunch", "date": "2018-03-27", "article": "Nvidia has taken the AutoSIM virtual environment for testing autonomous cars it originally showed off at CES, combined it with its Drive Pegasus AI in-car computer and created a virtual testing and validation loop that can handle billions of virtual driving miles in hyperrealistic environments, with the ability to model edge cases and recreate conditions that would be difficult to test exhaustively on real roads.  The system designed for use by its partners is called Drive Constellation, and involves using two different servers to accurately simulate real-world autonomous driving in a totally virtualized enviroment. One server runs Nvidia\u2019s Drive Sim software, which will simulate an automated vehicles sensory experience while out on the road, providing photorealistic camera captures and data from virtualized LiDAR and radar systems that accurately mimics what would be captured driving on a real road.  The second server in the system is running an Nvidia Drive Pegasus AI, or the \u2018brain\u2019 of an autonomous vehicle, which processes the data fed from the first server just as it would if it was real data being fed from vehicles sensors capturing it from the road. The Pegasus-powered server then returns its control commands back to the simulator, telling it to carry out driving activity just as it would a real car on the road.  This is what Nvidia terms a \u201chardware-in-the-loop\u201d cycle, and it can run at 30 such exchanges per second, helping to validate autonomous driving software performance. And because it can be fully controlled by the tester, the Drive Sim part of the equation can be tuned to provide a realistic driving experience like one might encounter on roads, or artificial conditions like enduring 24 hours of blinding, peak mid-day sun \u2013 or whatever edge case a researcher or developer might want to test and optimize for.  Edge cases remain the primary concern for anyone developing autonomous cars, and the issue with relying on real-world testing to build software that can properly handle these edge cases is that they don\u2019t occur often, and they\u2019re seldom replicable. Software simulation is a way to prepare for these rarely occurring instances without risk and without having to wait for conditions to align themselves just right (or wrong, as the case may be).  Nvidia\u2019s Drive Constellation is going to start becoming available to some of its partners through early access during the third quarter of this year, and will roll out commercially sometime after that.

Like, seriously.  Right now, in 2018, there are three architectures (that\u2019s right, three) competing to be the GeForce GTX 11 series of GPUs between Volta, Ampere and Turing. And, right now, we\u2019d have to put our money on Turing being the follow-up to the wildly successful, Pascal-based GeForce GTX 10 series graphics cards. We were kind of hoping Nvidia would reveal the identity of the architecture behind the GeForce GTX 11 series would be at GTC, but all we got was some AI and autonomous car information.  Similar to previous generational leaps, like Maxwell to Pascal, we\u2019re expecting the Nvidia GeForce GTX 11 series GPUs to bring efficiency, and maybe PC gaming as a whole, to an entirely new level with true 4K, 60 frames-per-second gaming powered by a single GPU.  Cut to the chase  What is it? Nvidia\u2019s next generation graphics cards for gamers  Nvidia\u2019s next generation graphics cards for gamers When is it out? Rumored for July 2018  Rumored for July 2018 What will it cost? Hopefully not much more than Pascal  Based on the latest reports from Tom\u2019s Hardware, which cited \u2018multiple independent sources\u2019 in the industry, we won\u2019t see Nvidia\u2019s next-generation graphics card release until July or later this year. Word on the Internet streets suggests that mass production of new GeForce cards won\u2019t begin until mid-June, so an earlier launch date seems unlikely.  If these rumors are true, the closest and biggest venue for Nvidia to make its big announcement would be Gamescom in August. That said, we haven\u2019t heard any more corroborating reports to suggest Tom\u2019s Hardware\u2019s information is correct.  Earlier reports from Tweaktown and Reuters suggested a Nvidia Turing announcement at the Game Developer\u2019s Conference or GTC 2018. Following that, cards were expected to be available as soon as April or May.  Although that timing would make sense, given the release date of the current line of Pascal cards in May 2016, as the year goes on it's looking more unlikely. And, now that GTC has come and gone with no mention of the next line of GeForce GPUs, it might be a while before Nvidia unveils its next line of GPUs.  Nvidia Turing price  Given the current state of GPU prices in a cryptocurrency-crazed world, we can\u2019t but help to predict higher prices for graphics cards in the near future. Especially given that the Pascal graphics cards came at a slightly higher premium over the last-generation Maxwell cards they replaced.  With that all in mind, we wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see the price of Turing GPUs take a slight uptick over these following Founders Cards that are currently available:  Nvidia Turing specs  Given that the firm has already introduced its new 12-nanometer manufacturing process with Nvidia Volta, we fully expect that it will trickle down to the company\u2019s likely consumer-facing Turing GPU line. Beyond that, though, there aren\u2019t too many confirmed details or conclusions we can make about the specs surrounding Nvidia\u2019s next line of graphics cards.  For one thing, reports are still debating whether the successor to the Nvidia GTX 1080 will be given a GTX 1180 or GTX 2080 model naming convention. Then there\u2019s the question of whether Turing will employ GDDR6 video memory or HBM2, as seen on the Nvidia Titan V .  For now, we\u2019ll have to sit and wait for more concrete leaks and rumors before we can begin to even speculate as to how well-equipped Nvidia Turing graphics cards will be.  Whatever the case, we fully expect Nvidia to deliver with new GPU technology that pushes the envelope for PC gaming as it always has.", "stock": "NVDA"}, {"url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/computing-components/graphics-cards/amd-vs-nvidia-who-makes-the-best-graphics-cards-699480", "label": 1, "source": "techradar", "date": "2018-04-09", "article": "Ask any console gamer, and they\u2019ll likely tell you about the perennial rivalry between the Xbox One and PS4. However, PC gamers have their own internal feud, albeit without the headlines: Nvidia vs AMD. Don\u2019t be fooled \u2013 it\u2019s a good thing. The sheer amount of innovation and competition springing from this tech feud is nothing short of amazing. Still, if you\u2019re not willing to pledge loyalty to one of these tech behemoths, it can be hard to decide what the best graphics card for your needs is.  Don\u2019t worry though, we here at TechRadar have decided to sit down and figure out once and for all the true winner in the battle of Nvidia vs AMD. (Spoiler: it never ends)  In 2018, Nvidia and AMD are still at each other's\u2019 throats. It\u2019s been almost two years since Nvidia launched its GeForce 10 series, and while it\u2019s likely Nvidia will replace its Pascal architecture with either Volta or Turing in 2018, it doesn\u2019t really need to. Following the launch of the GeForce GTX 1070 Ti, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told us not to expect a new generation of Nvidia GPUs until late 2018 at least. Still, with the Nvidia Titan V, we did get a sneak peek at what the future may look like.  And we\u2019ve also started to hear rumblings about the Nvidia Volta line of GPUs, so be sure to stay tuned for more updates.  Over on the red side, AMD has recently released its AMD Vega line of graphics cards. Existing as the much-anticipated successor to the flawed Polaris architecture, AMD\u2019s newest line of GPUs have only recently come out in August 2017. AMD has also come out with some driver updates that are meant to boost performance in many popular esports.  No matter how you slice it, neither Nvidia or AMD are going away any time soon, so that\u2019s why we created this guide \u2013 to dive in and figure out precisely how they differ. From their exclusive features to price-to-performance ratio, even down to their drivers. And you can\u2019t forget all of those pesky exclusivity deals, either.  There are graphics card choices for days  Price  Anyone who browses Reddit or comment sections on tech websites will tell you that AMD is widely known for its affordability, and Nvidia for its high-end performance and high prices. But, are they actually right?  Well, there are plenty of benchmarks that pretty convincingly tell us that the AMD Radeon RX Vega 56, which is available for around $1,200 on Amazon (about \u00a3860, AU$1,539) at the time of writing, is a better performer than the $650 (about \u00a3549, AU$799) Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070. When you factor in the effect that cryptocurrency mining has on the prices, Nvidia actually has a pretty massive advantage from a pricing perspective.  And, assuming that the rumors that Nvidia is planning on releasing cards that are aimed exclusively at cryptocurrency miners is true, we could start seeing prices fall for gaming-focused cards. But we wouldn\u2019t exactly keep our hopes up for that.  Go higher, and you\u2019ll find that the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 is most comparable to the AMD Radeon Vega 64. At an MSRP (manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail price) level, both of these cost about the same. This is, of course, intentional on both companies\u2019 parts.  After revealing its 4K-focused GTX 1080 Ti earlier this year, the Green Team was keen on dropping the price of the 1080 in the process. So, that card went from an MSRP of $599 down to $499 in the US, even though you\u2019ll still likely find it for around $1,400 (\u00a3830, AU$1,299). Before long, AMD was putting the Vega 64 onto store shelves at the same price.  Among basically every sector of the market Nvidia and AMd graphics cards cost about the same when you take price-to-performance in mind. The best graphics card overall, the GTX 1060, is identical in price to the AMD Radeon RX 580, and for budget cards, the RX 560 is the exact same price as a GTX 1050.  At the end of the day, the better price is going to depend on where you\u2019re lucky enough to find a discount. However, because of the boom in popularity of cryptocurrencies, the discounts are going to be few and far between, even if Nvidia says it wants to get more cards in the hands of gamers.  Performance  When you\u2019re trying to build a PC that\u2019s more powerful than your arch-enemy\u2019s, buying a graphics card isn\u2019t a matter of price but performance. Packing the best performance for the lowest cost is the arguably the most pertinent factor in driving GPU sales.  It used to be that AMD fans praised the Red Team for being the clear champions of value, but these days it\u2019s not so simple. Due to cryptocurrency and its effect on the GPU market, right now Nvidia are the clear winners when it comes to price-to-performance ratio. And as further proof that Nvidia is killing the game right now: AMD hasn\u2019t even produced a true contender to the GTX 1080Ti.  To be fair, Vega has only been available for a few months now, and there was no GTX 1080 Ti equivalent at Pascal\u2019s launch either. Still, the GTX 1080 shows the RX Vega 64 up in several different areas, such as multi-rendering and NBody calculation, whereas the RX Vega 64 is better at rendering texture details and complex shading.  In other words, AMD and Nvidia are so close at this point that which is better is more of a matter of what games you play and at what resolution. As we reported back in October, the Vega 64 is a better match for Forza Motorsport 7 at 1080p. At the same time, Nvidia\u2019s flagship GPU managed the frame rate advantage in 4K.  This trend continues down the list of cheaper graphics cards from AMD and Nvidia, including the RX Vega 56, which sees higher frame rates than the GTX 1070 Founders Edition in DirectX 12-heavy games like Rise of the Tomb Raider and Deus Ex: Mankind Divided (91 fps vs 89 fps and 40 fps vs 31 fps, respectively), according to PCGamesN.  And now that we\u2019ve seen reports that the next generation of Nvidia GeForce cards may be using GDDR6 memory, delivering double the speed of GDDR5, we could see a major upset happening in the coming months.  Throw a Grand Theft Auto V into the mix, however, and we\u2019re talking 64 fps on the RX Vega 56 vs 79 fps from the GTX 1070.  Software, drivers and features  One key draw to using Nvidia hardware over AMD is the Green Team\u2019s GeForce Experience software.  Because it delivers driver updates and optimizes games in addition to letting you broadcast gameplay and capture screenshots as well as videos directly from its easy-to-use interface, Nvidia GeForce Experience is posited as the one PC gaming application to rule them all.  Meanwhile, AMD\u2019s newly announced Radeon Software Adrenalin Edition aims to overtake Nvidia\u2019s solution.. Previously known as Crimson ReLive, the latest re-skinned update of AMD\u2019s graphics application is stacked with all of the features you\u2019ve grown accustomed to since the UI was massively overhauled back in July, but with the benefit of more consistent updates driver updates to account for every major game release.  As of December 2016, you could already livestream via Radeon Crimson ReLive, but now you can take safety measures to ensure maximum power efficiency while you\u2019re gaming. That includes the ability to underclock memory frequencies, cap frame rates on a hardware level and enable \u201cEnhanced Sync\u201d to decrease frame stutter while it simultaneously combats screen tearing.  Still, GeForce Experience has the game optimization features we\u2019re all crazy for. So when you don\u2019t know what settings are best for your computer in The Witcher 3, Nvidia takes care of the heavy lifting for you.  AMD users can download and install Raptr\u2019s Gaming Evolved tool to optimize their gaming experience. However, the add-on is less than ideal considering its biggest rival\u2019s audience can accomplish nearly everything from within GeForce Experience. That includes using Nvidia Ansel to take way cool in-game photos at resolutions exceeding 63K (16 times that of which a 4K monitor can display).  Nvidia also has a leg up when it comes to streaming games whether it\u2019s to another gaming PC with at least a Maxwell-based GPU, as well as the company\u2019s self-made tablets and set-top box. Not to mention, Nvidia also has a cloud-based gaming service call GeForce Now available to Windows 10 and MacOS users.  Exclusivity  It was once rumored that AMD and Nvidia were enacting shady tactics, \u201cpaying off\u201d game developers to show preferential treatment towards one or the other. Were this the case, it would certainly explain why certain games run better using GeForce graphics than Radeon and vice versa.  Fortunately, we don\u2019t see these concerns from PC gamers as much anymore, but that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t exist.  Following its Capsaicin & Cream livestream event at GDC 2017, we spoke with AMD its to discuss its strategy in contending with Nvidia. The news that the company would partner with Bethesda Softworks to optimize its games for Radeon, Ryzen or both was worrying to say the least. And it still is.  At the time, the potential for games operating more smoothly on AMD systems meant that Nvidia could fight back by partnering with an equally large publisher. Although the latter maneuver hasn\u2019t happened yet, early Wolfenstein II performance comparisons, such as this one from TechEpiphany on YouTube have exhibited better performance and lower temps coming from the AMD Radeon RX 64 when pitted against Nvidia\u2019s GeForce GTX 1080.  We\u2019re not saying there\u2019s a bias towards AMD in Bethesda\u2019s technical design decisions, however we aren\u2019t ready to take off our tin foil hats quite yet either.  Of course, Bethesda is hardly the only company to show favoritism to either team red or green. If you ever see an AMD or Nvidia splash screen ahead of the title page when you start a game, you can bet it will run better with that company\u2019s hardware.  So, which is better? Neither  There\u2019s so much to love, and in some instances \u201cdis-love,\u201d about both Nvidia and AMD graphics. In the end, both of these companies rely on competition with each other to thrive. Suffice to say, the Nvidia vs AMD debate requires that you understand there\u2019s a reason Radeon and GeForce GPUs are so similar in performance right now.  Each company is doing its best to keep up with the mindshare of the other, and that\u2019s good for us. They\u2019re basically fighting for our money, learning from each other\u2019s mistakes and legislating marked improvements along the way.  It\u2019s up to you who wins the fiery contest of Nvidia vs AMD, although we will say this: Nvidia is unmatched in the 4K market right now. If it helps any, the GTX 1080 Ti is your best bet if you want your PC to keep up with the likes of your Ultra HD display.

But sadly, we\u2019re inclined to believe that may prove to be a false hope\u2026  At any rate, the rumor from Crypto Mining Blog is that Nvidia is about to release new graphics cards based on the firm\u2019s GP102 GPU (as used in the Titan X and Xp cards, and GeForce GTX 1080 Ti), with one specific board mentioned which is coming from Inno3D.  Apparently, this P102-100 mining GPU from Inno3D (pictured below) will run with 3,200 CUDA cores and a base clock speed of 1582MHz. It will have 5GB of GDDR5X video RAM and a TDP of 250W, and for cooling, will use dual-fans and five copper heat pipes.  As this is a dedicated cryptocurrency mining card, there won\u2019t be any video outputs to connect the GPU up to a monitor. Therefore, these products are strictly for miners only.  The graphics card will be able to achieve mining hash rates of up to 47MH/s in Ethereum, and 879H/s when it comes to Monero, and the leak claims that this information comes directly from the manufacturer \u2013 although Inno3D doesn\u2019t specify whether this is at stock clocks (as opposed to post-overclocking).  As expected, there is no indication of pricing at the moment, and that will obviously be a key talking point.  Once again, let\u2019s underline the fact that this is speculation at this point, although the details provided by the blog concerning the spec of the purported Inno3D GPU are pretty in-depth.  Image Credit: Crypto Mining Blog (Image: \u00a9 Crypto Mining Blog)  Pressure points  If this graphics card does indeed emerge in the near future as indicated, can we then hope that this will be one of a number of fresh mining models with Nvidia GPUs? Likewise, hopefully their launch might help take the pressure off the huge demand for GeForce gaming GPUs that are currently being used for mining, pushing the prices of these cards up massively.  As we mentioned at the outset, while this is certainly a grand hope, the reality is probably very different. For starters, we have to consider that there\u2019s a shortage of video memory affecting all GPU makers right now, and that isn\u2019t predicted to ease until much later this year.  So, these new mining cards will still face the same issue as gaming-targeted GeForce GPUs: quite simply, there\u2019s only so much memory to go around.  Secondly, from the chatter we\u2019ve seen online, miners are still eyeing up GeForce models as a better overall value proposition than dedicated mining GPUs. One issue is resale value: a GeForce GTX card will carry its weight going forward in that respect, whereas a video card strictly for mining \u2013 with no possibility for usage anywhere else due to the lack of display outputs \u2013 has very limited resale prospects.  Finally, another apparent thorn is speculation about these mining cards' pricing being pitched relatively high, so that GeForce cards may remain a more economical proposition anyway (particularly considering the aforementioned resale considerations).  This all comes together to suggest that miners may indeed buy these dedicated GPUs, but not ahead of GeForce models.  Price of profits  Naturally, a lot of this will depend on where Nvidia and third-party manufacturers pitch the price of these mining-specific offerings, and as they\u2019re cut-down cards, we could hope for the best. But the reality is given the memory shortage and state of supply and demand in the GPU market, there isn\u2019t any realistic incentive to chop into chunky profits.  So, how does all this add up overall? Assuming these cards are imminent, we may not see much price pressure relief in the graphics card market simply due to the way things are with the scarcity of video RAM right now.  But that doesn\u2019t stop this being a hopeful sign for the future, if not the nearer-term. Later in 2018, when the memory shortage is forecast to ease, perhaps we\u2019ll see more of these kind of dedicated GPUs emerging \u2013 and then the prices of gaming graphics cards could finally start to normalize again.

It's a rendering technique based on how we see the world. In nature, light photons bounce off of various objects before they hit your eyes. Because simulating every photon in real-time is a little ambitious, ray tracing reverses that process, sending millions of lines outwards from the camera towards the scene in front. When a ray hits something, it then checks the object's properties as well as the light sources around it to calculate the exact color that pixel on your screen should be.  There's more to it, of course, but no one wants to read about algorithms on a Monday morning. All you need to know is that it makes scenes look much more realistic. Pretty much all pre-rendered CGI (think, any Hollywood blockbuster) utilizes ray tracing, but it's been thought of as too demanding for use in gaming outside of certain effects.  NVIDIA says lots of developers are on board and will be showing off real-time ray tracing at the GDC this week. Engine partners include Epic Games (Unreal Engine), EA (Frostbite) and Unity; in addition, EA, 4A Games (Metro series) and Remedy (Quantum Break) are signed up on the development side. As previously mentioned, Microsoft is also an API partner with DirectX. What we probably won't see on show are the new GameWorks features, which \"will support Volta and future generation GPU architectures\" and enable ray-traced area shadows, ray-traced glossy reflections and ray-traced ambient occlusion.  GameWorks, for those of you that aren't into PCs and/or controversy, is NVIDIA middleware that allows developers to add extra bells and whistles to their games. A lot of it is related to physics and lighting, but the features you've probably heard of are HairWorks and TurfWorks, which, in games like Final Fantasy XV, allow for richer grass and fluffier creatures. GameWorks is also fairly controversial in PC gaming -- the features are heavily optimized for NVIDIA cards, and running them on an AMD GPU often leads to terrible performance, as NVIDIA won't share its source code with its rival. (Some would argue they lead to terrible performance on NVIDIA cards as well, it's just not quite as pronounced.)  RTX and the as-yet-unnamed GameWorks features were announced on a briefing call last week. The short Q-and-A session that followed can essentially be summarised as \"journalists find creative ways to ask if NVIDIA is going to announce a Volta GeForce card.\" Despite some inventive phrasing, none of the question-askers were successful.  Recent rumors suggested that the next GeForce line won't even be based on Volta, but rather some sort of bridging architecture called \"Ampere.\" That seems unlikely, given the announcement of Volta-specific features, but the \"future generation GPU architectures\" mention does mean NVIDIA could announce wider compatibility if and when Ampere is announced. Now that NVIDIA's GDC is done, the next date for a graphics card announcement would be its GPU Technology Conference (GTC) at the end of the month. GTC is more focused on self-driving cars and AI, but the March 27th keynote could make a nice platform for an announcement.", "stock": "NVDA"}, {"url": "https://www.engadget.com/2018/02/21/shadow-virtualizes-a-high-end-gaming-pc-on-your-desktop-clunker/", "label": -1, "source": "engadget", "date": "2018-02-21", "article": "The Shadow system has found widespread adoption throughout France and made its US debut at CES last month. The idea is relatively simple: Instead of having to buy, maintain and upgrade your own hardware, you pay Blade a monthly subscription to use theirs. It's a concept similar to what NVIDIA did with its GeForce NOW cloud service, Parsec or HP's Omen PCs, save for the fact that those three are dedicated to gaming while Shadow enables users to run everything from Steam to Photoshop to a host of other business-related applications.  The company has partnered with Microsoft, NVIDIA, AMD and Equinix to create a remote Windows 10 PC that you can access over the internet. At the remote server farm, each of these systems boasts a dedicated NVIDIA graphics card capable of handling 1080p at 144Hz or 4K at 60Hz. For processing, the system relies on eight dedicated threads on an Intel Xeon processor (the equivalent of an Intel Core i7) as well as offering 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage.  Therefore, it doesn't matter what hardware you're using to access the service. Shadow can run on Macs, Chromebooks, Windows PCs, Android, iOS, and a variety of smart TV platforms. However, this does lead to a paradox. Sure, Shadow can deliver 4K quality video streams over the internet, but if you're trying to watch it on an old 720p monitor, you're going to be watching that stream in 720p.  Luckily, that doesn't seem to apply to the rest of the capabilities. Because the Shadow system is, in essence, a remote desktop, it doesn't matter how old, underpowered or decrepit the device is you're running it on, just how good the screen is. In fact, at CES, Blade managed to run the Shadow service on Razer's new phone, running full PC games (e.g., Battlefront II) on the device at 2K resolution and 120 Hz.  What's also cool is that you're able to switch between operating systems on the fly. Say you're virtualizing the Shadow's Windows 10 desktop on your Mac. Because the Windows 10 OS is running remotely (only using the Mac's video driver to decode signal), it doesn't take up any of the Mac's other local resources. There is no slowdown in the macOS due to the Windows 10 desktop (and vice versa) and you can toggle between them instantly.", "stock": "NVDA"}, {"url": "https://www.engadget.com/2018/03/27/nvidia-quadro-gv100-gpu/", "label": -1, "source": "engadget", "date": "2018-03-27", "article": "Under the hood, the GV100 features 7.4 teraflops of power for double-precision rendering (which helps to avoid errors), 14.8 teraflops for single-precision and 118.5 teraflops for deep learning.

The GV100 comes with 32GB of memory, but you can also use NVIDIA's NVLINK technology to pair it with another card for 64GB.  While the GV100 isn't meant for consumers, it's a big step towards bringing NVIDIA's Volta architecture towards more mainstream cards.

The logo for Twitter, which fell more than Facebook on Tuesday, on a phone post at the New York Stock Exchange in 2015. Photo: Richard Drew/Associated Press  The highflying technology stocks had been ignoring rising threats for a while. Reality reasserted itself on Tuesday.  The immediate cause for plummeting tech shares was company-specific: Chip maker Nvidia Corp. NVDA -1.32% halted road tests of driverless vehicles after an Uber Technologies Inc. test car was involved in a fatal crash, and Facebook Inc. FB 0.40% CEO Mark Zuckerberg will be hauled before Congress. The announcements highlighted the risks to two of the biggest tech disruption themes, self-driving cars and social media.  But the market fall wasn\u2019t just about Facebook and Nvidia, or even self-driving cars and social media, although the themes mattered, with Tesla Inc. dropping more than Nvidia, and Twitter Inc. TWTR -0.83% losing more than Facebook.  Instead, the market is waking up to an even broader threat: politics. It might also be sniffing another danger, from economics.  The political risk is obvious for Facebook, which stands at the unpleasant intersection of privacy fears and fake news. Facebook is accused of unwittingly aiding the manipulation of the U.S. election by Russian agents, of helping swing the Brexit referendum and, linked to both cases, failing to notice that the personal details of 50 million users had been snatched.  The arguments about who, what, where and why are far from being resolved, but Facebook highlights the forces gathering against tech investors. Disruptive companies are bound to make powerful enemies in old industries, but the tech companies have alienated many natural supporters among the wider public through their swagger, wealth and tax avoidance. Businesses that were once beloved by consumers for taking on the corporate establishment have become the corporate establishment in the eyes of many of their customers.  Cities and states were first to flex their muscles, forcing companies such as Uber and Airbnb Inc. to follow local rules and pay taxes. The threats now are much bigger.  The European Commission is pushing for a 3% tax on the revenue of internet giants, while pressure is increasing for \u201cgig economy\u201d workers to be treated as employees. The rush by companies to pull their ads from Facebook may be merely temporary, but it shows just how far the social network has slumped in public opinion and how much privacy is becoming an issue for Americans. In Europe, privacy rules have just been tightened again.  There is also a backlash to the sheer scale of many of the big internet companies. Earnest discussion among economists about the new monopolies is unlikely to lead directly to government intervention, but a change in public perception makes antitrust action more likely. Again, Europe has been leading the way by taking on Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google.  There is a further danger, from the economy. A stronger economy should mean more companies are able to demonstrate rising sales. Investors who want growth will be able to buy businesses exposed to the economic cycle, and the fast-expanding tech companies will lose some of their exclusivity in the minds of shareholders. The same point can be seen by looking at interest rates. As rates rise, profits far in the future look less attractive, which should compress the valuation of disrupters reinvesting all their earnings in the hope of future returns. If\u2014and it is a big if\u2014you expect the economy to improve and bond yields to rise, disruptive tech stocks should be less appealing.  Tech stocks rode high in the past three years, ignoring all these concerns as investors focused on the extraordinary profits and dominant market shares many were producing. Sentiment was overly positive, and the backlash was ignored.  It isn\u2019t always true that highflying stocks fall further, but it certainly was on Tuesday. Out of the top 100 stocks in the S&P 500 for the year to Monday, 39 were in the bottom 100 on Tuesday, about double what would be expected by chance. It worked the other way, too, with just over one-third of the bottom 100 stocks for the year in the top 100 on Tuesday, led by General Electric Co. , the fifth-worst performer this year and the best on Tuesday.  In the short run, the drop means the overly fast upward momentum of the big tech stocks has abated, leaving them less exposed to further selling driven by technical factors, although Amazon.com Inc. led more falls on Wednesday after a report that President Donald Trump wants to target the company.  In the longer run, expect lots of contrition from tech company CEOs as they try to head off political pressure on the bottom line.

In a detailed note citing extensive channel checks with chip suppliers, brokerage Nomura Instinet said it anticipated that Apple would drop Qualcomm in favour of a handful of other suppliers, as it seeks to reduce materials costs for iPhones.  Nomura said it believed Apple would source all of its thin modems - half of which are currently supplied by Qualcomm - from Intel.  Intel shares were up 1.4 percent at $46.81.

Apple will save more than $100 million in the next iPhone cycle by moving to cheaper Intel modem chips, Nomura analyst Romit Shah said.  Broadcom Ltd, which is trying to acquire Qualcomm, will likely lose some $400 million worth of sales of Apple parts in the second half of the year to Qorvo Inc, Shah added.  The reports came as Broadcom on Monday sweetened its bid to buy Qualcomm to more than $121 billion from an earlier $103 billion.  Qualcomm was hit with a $1.23 billion fine by European Union antitrust regulators last month for paying Apple to use only its chips, blocking out rivals such as Intel.  Intel began supplying modem chips to Apple from the iPhone 7 onwards.

The U.S. company exited the market when competition from Japanese companies became too great in the early 1990s, then recently re-entered. One of Intel\u2019s biggest growth areas last year was memory chips, but it has a long way to go to catch up with Samsung.  The South Korean company got its start in memory chips by licensing technology from Intel\u2019s Japanese foes. Samsung is moving in on Intel\u2019s traditional turf now, making higher-priced components. Its factories now churn out processors that run mobile phones and it\u2019s the contract manufacturer for Qualcomm Inc., which is taking a run at Intel in PC and server processors.", "stock": "INTC"}, {"url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2018-01-24/qualcomm-s-market-heft-works-in-its-favor-against-broadcom", "label": 1, "source": "bloomberg", "date": "2018-01-24", "article": "Government watchdogs are troublesome, but they help when it comes to thwarting a takeover.  Government watchdogs are troublesome, but they help when it comes to thwarting a takeover.  Qualcomm Inc. has been stung by governments so often that the fines and scolding barely leave a mark anymore. Now, though, Qualcomm\u2019s government troubles come with a silver lining.  The chipmaker\u2019s latest regulatory run-in was with the European Union\u2019s antitrust body, which fined Qualcomm 997 million euros ($1.2 billion) for paying one of its customers, Apple Inc., to agree to use only Qualcomm\u2019s chips in its iPhones and iPads from 2011 to 2016. The EU antitrust authority said Qualcomm\u2019s arrangement amounted to an improper abuse of market power. Qualcomm said it disagreed with the EU decision and planned to appeal.  It\u2019s a familiar pattern for corporations. Governments tend to wade in when big technology companies become overwhelmingly powerful in their fields. It has happened to Microsoft, Intel and Google to varying degrees. The steely gaze of governments now seems to be turning to Facebook.  The distractions, financial penalties and expensive regulatory and legal skirmishes are the inevitable costs of market power, and Qualcomm knows this well by now. It has clashed with government authorities in South Korea, China, the U.S., and other countries over claims that Qualcomm abuses its dominance in the market for important smartphone components.  When the Chips Are Down Qualcomm's stock is trading below Broadcom's takeover offer of $70 a share, indicating doubts Broadcom can pull off the transaction Source: Bloomberg  Oddly, Qualcomm is now in a position where the government scrutiny helps its cause. Among Qualcomm\u2019s efforts to ward off an unwanted takeover attempt by fellow chipmaker Broadcom Ltd., the company has argued that regulators wouldn\u2019t clear the deal or that regulatory compromises would be too onerous. Yes, on the one hand Qualcomm has been fighting claims that it abuses its market power. And on the other, its size and market power help support Qualcomm's case against a Broadcom takeover.  Qualcomm's concerns are valid. If Broadcom and Qualcomm combine, the company would be the third-largest chipmaker in the world by revenue, behind Intel and Samsung. Broadcom has said that the companies' businesses don't overlap much, but the sheer size would certainly invite regulatory doubts.  And Broadcom has argued -- without much elaboration-- that it will be able to tackle Qualcomm\u2019s continuing government challenges by overhauling Qualcomm\u2019s contentious business model, which generates most of the company's operating profit from licensing patents. Apple and some of the government authorities have said that business model is a way for Qualcomm to overcharge customers.  Flexing Muscles If Broadcom acquires Qualcomm, the combined company would be the world's third-largest chipmaker by revenue Source: Bloomberg  One question is what customers think of the possible creation of an even more hefty chip supplier. The Wall Street Journal reported this month that three leading Chinese smartphone manufacturers are concerned about the Broadcom-Qualcomm deal because they worry a combination would result in higher prices for essential chips. In a rebuttal on Tuesday, Broadcom said that any antitrust concerns could be resolved and that Broadcom\u2019s customers supported an acquisition of Qualcomm.  It can't be fun for Qualcomm (or its stockholders) to see billions of dollars fly out of its coffers to mollify regulators. But Qualcomm must be smiling a little that government watchdogs are also helping the company's case against a takeover.

Customers are charging they were harmed by the attacks; shareholders charge that Intel misled them about the state of its business, because it didn't disclose them sooner.  At least one shareholder suit is taking aim at alleged insider trading at Intel; questions have been raised about a massive stock sale by the company's CEO after Intel was informed of the attacks but before it disclosed them to the public.  The Spectre and Meltdown attacks were a public relations nightmare for Intel. Now they've become a legal headache as well.  The chip making giant, its board members, and executives face 35 lawsuits related to the attacks, the company disclosed in its annual report on Friday. Because the suits are in their early stages, Intel said it couldn't determine how much they could potentially cost it.  \"We dispute the claims ... and intend to defend the lawsuits vigorously,\" the company said in its annual report.  A company representative declined to comment on the lawsuits.  Security researchers disclosed the Spectre and Meltdown attacks last month. Taking advantage of a particular feature found in nearly all computer processors, the attacks could allow a malicious actor to view secret data stored on PCs, tablets, and smartphones, including users' passwords. In recent weeks, chip makers, device manufacturers, and operating system vendors have been scrambling to patch their devices and software to protect them from the vulnerabilities.  The attacks were actually discovered in June, and Intel was made aware of them soon thereafter. The vulnerability the attacks exploit has been present in nearly all Intel chips made over the last 20 years. And, unlike chips made by other manufacturers, Intel's processors are vulnerable to both Spectre and Meltdown.  Intel's handling of Spectre and Meltdown has drawn criticism \u2014 and now lawsuits  Intel's handling of the situation has raised eyebrows not just because it waited more than six months to disclose the attacks to the public despite the fact that its chips were particularly at risk of them, but also because of a massive stock sale made by company CEO Brian Krzanich after the company found out about the attacks. In sale \u2014 through which Krzanich saw a $24 million windfall \u2014 the CEO sold off all of the shares of Intel he was allowed to sell under his contract.  Intel has noted that the sale, which Krzanich made in November, was done as part of a planned stock divestiture. But Krzanich only put that plan in place a month earlier, which was more than four months after Intel became aware of the attacks.  Thirty of the lawsuits filed against Intel are seeking class action status and were filed by customers who claim they were harmed by the attacks or by the company's failure to disclose them, according to the annual report. Two of the suits, also seeking class action status, were filed on behalf of shareholders who charge that the disclosure of the attacks shows that statements Intel made about its products or business were false or misleading.  Additionally, another three Intel investors have filed shareholder derivative suits in California state court, according to the annual report. Those suits charge that Intel's executives or directors failed in their duties to shareholders by delaying disclosure of the breach or not doing anything about insider trading at the company.

The Journal is reporting that Intel notified some of its customers of the security flaws in its processors, dubbed Spectre and Meltdown, but left out the U.S. government as part of that. Some of the companies Intel notified included Chinese technology companies, though the report suggests there is no evidence that any information was misused. An Intel spokesperson told The Journal that the company wasn\u2019t able to tell everyone it planned because the news was made public earlier than expected.

In this case, news of the exploit was reported ahead of the industry coalition\u2019s intended public disclosure date at which point Intel immediately engaged the US government and others.\u201d  Intel has had to scramble to respond to the news, which came out nearly a week earlier than expected. Companies can notify some major customers and parties of flaws before they\u2019re publicly disclosed so fixes and patches can come out and contain as much of the fallout as possible. The Meltdown and Specter flaws were particularly hazardous because they theoretically can affect pretty much everyone and the end result is a massive cleanup effort to make sure everything gets patched.  But because of the scale of the issue, and Intel\u2019s very precarious position of having to ensure as limited impact to its customers as possible, it\u2019s a very tricky situation to figure out who to inform and when in order to ensure everything gets resolved without the information becoming widespread and a source of additional risk for those customers. Intel reported its fourth-quarter earnings last week, after which the stock jumped nearly 10% despite the news about Meltdown and Spectre continuing to trickle in.  \u201cWhile we\u2019ve made progress, I am acutely aware that we have more to do,\u201d Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said on the call to discuss its fourth quarter results. \u201cWe\u2019ve committed to being transparent, keeping our customers and owners appraised of our progress and, through our actions, building trust. Security is a top priority for Intel, foundational to our products, and it\u2019s critical to the success of our data-centric strategy. Our near-term focus is on delivering high-quality mitigations to protect our customers\u2019 infrastructure on these exploits. We\u2019re working to incorporate silicon-based changes to future products that will directly address the Spectre and Meltdown threats in hardware, and those products will begin appearing later this year.

This SSD is priced so low we would call it a no-brainer for all modern PC builds.  Our biggest pet peeve with computing nowadays \u2013 aside from the price of graphics cards being too damn high, thanks to bitcoin mining \u2013 is the lack of affordable and fast NVMe solid-state storage. Thankfully, that\u2019s starting to change this year, and Intel\u2019s new 760p Series SSD has us absolutely giddy.  Built upon Intel\u2019s new 64-layer 3D NAND technology, the 760p Series not only doubles the speed of its previous consumer SSDs, it\u2019s also nearly as affordable. Starting at $74 (about \u00a350, AU$90) for an 128GB drive, $109 (about \u00a380, AU$140) for 256GB and $199 (about \u00a3140, AU$250) for 512GB \u2013 which we tested \u2013 these are some of the cheapest NVMe drives you\u2019re going to find this year.  Features  Again, Intel\u2019s 760p Series SSDs use the company\u2019s new 64-layer 3D NAND technology that\u2019s twice as dense as the company\u2019s 32-layer NAND used on the previous generation of Intel 600p Series SSDs. Thanks to this doubling of density, Intel promises its new drives are nearly twice as fast and more power efficient than before.  The 512GB capacity 760p Series is rated for 3,230 MB/s sequential read and 1,625 MB/s sequential write speeds. That\u2019s a significant increase from the 512GB Intel SSD 600p\u2019s 1,775 MB/s and 560 MB/s sequential read and write speeds, respectively.  It\u2019s also enough speed to give Samsung\u2019s almost undisputed 960 Evo SSDs reason to worry. Though Samsung\u2019s NVMe drive still pulls slightly ahead with 3,200 MB/s and 1,800 MB/s sequential read and write speeds, respectively, it's also more expensive with a 500GB capacity unit priced at $229 (\u00a3223, AU$315).

Though it doesn\u2019t completely hit on the promised speeds, we expect performance will only get better with further driver updates.  Comparatively, the Samsung 960 Evo is still a quicker with 3394.9 MB/s and 1949.3 MB/s sequential read and write speeds, respectively. But ultimately, you\u2019re also going to be paying a higher premium for that increased speed  What\u2019s more, the Intel 760p Series SSD offers more than enough high-speed read performance to make it a solid storage device for gaming. Asset-heavy, open-world games like Assassin\u2019s Creed Origins loaded like a dream while also giving us incredibly fast boot times to get into Windows 10 .  The drive\u2019s slightly sluggish write speeds might not work for impatient video editors, so we would suggest the Samsung 960 Pro for its much-faster 2,100 MB/s sequential write capabilities.  Final verdict  Intel 760p Series SSDs are a serious step up for the brand\u2019s NVMe capable solid-state drives. It\u2019s not often we see storage take a leap in speed this significant.  What\u2019s more, it\u2019s just priced extremely affordably.  A 256GB SSD with PCIe Gen 3.0 x 4 speed for $109 (about \u00a380, AU$140) is almost a no-brainer for the modern PC builder, and the $199 (about \u00a3140, AU$250) for the 512GB unit we reviewed isn\u2019t a far stretch either.

After all, getting a PC to boot is one thing, but getting it to run decently with a Core i5 (or Core i7) processor is another.  As other contributors to that thread note, there are likely to be issues with getting a six-core processor to run successfully given the power requirements of these chips \u2013 and there's probably a very real danger of damaging the CPU.  Even running a Core i3 like this is an endeavor which should certainly be approached with caution, and generally speaking, we wouldn\u2019t recommend it. And it definitely shouldn\u2019t be attempted by anyone who isn\u2019t fully confident and tech-savvy when it comes to PCs and messing around with components.  Nonetheless, it\u2019s very interesting to see that entry-level Coffee Lake processors look like they do actually work with these older Intel motherboards, despite the official party line.

The latest Dell XPS 15 is all about bringing the power of Intel H series and Core i9 processors to a laptop thin as an Ultrabook . In that regard, Dell absolutely delivers, enabling specifications with serious power available in a thin and light, 14-inch laptop frame.  Naturally, that frame houses a 15.6-inch InfinityEdge touch display with barely-there bezels \u2013 this and more going for a price that ought to give Apple pause. While we\u2019re holding full judgment until a full review, things are looking up for Dell\u2019s supersized XPS laptop of 2018.  Price and availability  Dell will start selling the new XPS 15 this May at a decent price of $999 (about \u00a3949, AU$1,299). That starting price includes an 8th-generation Intel Kaby Lake Core i5-8300H processor that runs up to 4.0GHz, paired with an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 graphics card with 4GB of GDDR5 video memory.  Those both power a 15.6-inch FHD (1,920 x 1,080) InfinityEdge display that\u2019s just around 14 inches wide. The anti-glare screen meets 100% sRGB, sports a 1,200:1 contrast ratio, shines at 400 nits, has IPS for 178-degree wide viewing angles. This display can be upgraded to a 4K Ultra HD (3,840 x 2,160) InfinityEdge touch display with a juiced up contrast ratio.  Likewise, the graphics can be upgraded to GTX 1050 Ti, and the processor to an Intel Core i7-8750H at 4.1GHz or even an Intel Core i9 CPU, to keep pace with that sharper display.  As for memory and storage, the XPS 15 comes with 8GB of DDR4 RAM to start and can be upgraded to 32GB, meanwhile starting storage comes in at a 128GB SSD + 1TB HDD. From there, you have 256GB PCIe NMVe SSD, 1TB solid state hybrid drive, 512GB PCIe NMVe SSD and 1TB PCIe NMVe SSD options.  Of course, prices for all of these upgrades are unknown at this time. However, all models will feature widescreen HD (720p) webcams with dual array digital microphones, as well as the following connectivity options: one Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C), two USB 3.1 Gen 1, one HDMI 2.0, an SD card reader (SD, SDHC, SDXC), a headset jack, Killer 1535 802.11ac (2 x 2 MIMO) Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.1 radios.

Of course, that includes a brushed aluminum lid and base that surround a soft-touch carbon fiber keyboard deck.  That keyboard deck feels as plush as usual and houses the same Dell keyboard you\u2019ve come to love, so expect deep enough travel and strong feedback.  The display, whether in 1080p or 4K, looks fantastically sharp and bright and is nearly bezel-less. Of course, this has driven the webcam into Dell\u2019s now-classic \u2018Chin Cam\u2019 position \u2013 not that rivals like Huawei MateBook X Pro have done much better.  All told, the XPS 15 accomplishes quite a lot for a laptop that\u2019s just 0.66 inches (17mm) thick and weighs just 4 pounds (1.8kg).  Performance  We anticipate that the available processor options will allow this laptop to gobble all basic computing tasks up for breakfast. That said, we don\u2019t expect Core i9 to entice the XPS 15 core audience. Rather data crunchers and extreme Excel users might find the most use out of the hexa-core CPU.  Given the high-premium the Intel Core i9 chip places on other laptops like the MSI GT75 Titan, we can expect the highest end version of the Dell XPS 15 to be as equally as expensive.  That said, Dell promises a battery life goal of 21 and a half hours with the XPS 15. Perhaps that\u2019s possible with the 1080p model, but we\u2019ll believe it when we see it.  At any rate, it\u2019s easy to expect some pretty impressive performance even from the entry-level XPS 15, especially for the price to start.  Early verdict  The new-and-improved Dell XPS 15 really takes the performance factor to the next level with Intel\u2019s latest H series processors and Core i9 mega-tasking capability paired with strong Nvidia graphics. Even at its starting price, you\u2019re looking at quite the rival to Apple\u2019s 15-inch MacBook Pro.  For the money, the XPS 15 looks like it\u2019s going to turn quite a few heads when it lands this May in stores and online.

INTC -1.63% reported record growth in fourth-quarter revenue as sales in its data-center business jumped 20%, while the company swung to a quarterly loss as it booked a $5.4 billion charge after recent changes in U.S. tax law.  Overall revenue rose 4% to $17.05 billion. Intel reported a $687 million loss, compared with a profit of $3.56 billion a year earlier, largely because of the tax impact.  The company said it expects a 2018 tax rate of 14%, compared with an adjusted rate of 23% in 2017, which doesn\u2019t account for the tax impact.  The chip giant also announced a 10% rise in its annual dividend to $1.20 a share.

That pushed full-year growth in the segment to 11%, above Intel\u2019s goal of high single-digit growth for 2017.  In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Intel finance chief Bob Swan attributed the growth to demand from cloud vendors and communications networks, as well as surprisingly strong sales to corporate data centers, which had been sluggish.  \u201cWe saw strong customer demand for high-performance products across the board,\u201d he said. He cautioned, however, he doesn\u2019t expect the rising pace of sales to corporate customers to continue.  Intel\u2019s report Thursday came as the company continues to work on closing recently disclosed security holes in virtually all its processors.  The company has said that it doesn\u2019t expect the security flaws to affect its finances, but questions linger about just how seriously customers are affected, especially those that operate large data centers, and what redress they might demand. At the outset of the company\u2019s conference call with analysts, Chief Executive Brian Krzanich said Intel is working around the clock to fix the flaws, but conceded that \u201cwhile we\u2019ve made progress, I am acutely aware that we have more to do.\u201d  In the personal-computer division, where Intel faces stepped up competition from Advanced Micro Devices Inc., sales fell 2%, in line with the quarter\u2019s drop in PC shipments tallied by industry researcher Gartner Inc.  Intel has been trimming costs to keep margins up as it transitions from PCs to a broader technology portfolio. It has pledged to bring annual operating expenses to 30% of revenue by 2020. In the quarter, it cut those costs to 31% of revenue, compared with 34% in the year-earlier period and averaging 33.7% for the year.  The company also posted strong growth in some areas where it has been seeking to expand its market, though the businesses for now are much smaller than PC and data-center chips.  Sales of programmable chips, which can be reconfigured on the fly, were up 35%, while sales of chips for a variety of items known as the Internet of Things, were up 21%. Memory, where Intel is investing heavily, achieved profitability, Intel said, though sales growth slowed to 9%, a slightly steeper drop than some analysts expected.  Intel shares were up 3.5% after hours, having fallen 0.5% to $45.30 in regular New York trading. Through Thursday\u2019s close, the stock was up 29% since late July, when surging second-quarter revenue and profit sparked investor confidence that the company could overcome its challenges.  The company\u2019s forecast for the current year was for profit of about $3.55 a share on an adjusted basis, on revenue of about $65 billion, compared with $3.46 a share in adjusted profit and $62.8 billion in revenue for 2017.  Intel reported per-share earnings of $1.08 for the quarter on an adjusted basis, which excludes the tax-law impact and other items such as restructuring and acquisition-related costs.

Intel\u2019s decision to inform Chinese technology companies about security flaws in its processors raises concerns that the information could have reached the Chinese government before being publicly divulged. Photo: steinba/EPA/Shutterstock  In initial disclosures about critical security flaws discovered in its processors, Intel Corp. INTC -1.63% notified a small group of customers, including Chinese technology companies, but left out the U.S. government, according to people familiar with the matter and some of the companies involved.  The decision raises concerns, security researchers said, as it potentially could have allowed information about the chip flaws, dubbed Spectre and Meltdown, to fall into the hands of the Chinese government before being publicly divulged. There is no evidence any information was misused, the researchers said.  Weeks after word of the flaws first surfaced, Intel\u2019s choices about who would receive advance warning continue to ripple through the security and tech industries.  The flaws were first identified in June by a member of Google\u2019s Project Zero security team. Intel had planned to make the discovery public on Jan. 9\u2014people working to protect systems from hacks often hold off on announcements while fixes are devised\u2014but sped up its timetable when the news became widely known on Jan. 3, a day after U.K. website the Register wrote about the flaws.  Because the flaws can be leveraged to sneak sensitive data out of the cloud, information about them would be of great interest to any intelligence-gathering agency, said Jake Williams, president of the security company Rendition Infosec LLC and a former National Security Agency employee. In the past, Chinese state-linked hackers have exploited software vulnerabilities to get leverage on their targets or expand surveillance.  It is a \u201cnear certainty\u201d Beijing was aware of the conversations between Intel and its Chinese tech partners, because authorities there routinely monitor all such communications, Mr. Williams said.  Representatives from China\u2019s ministry in charge of information technology didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. The country\u2019s foreign ministry has in the past said it is \u201cresolutely opposed\u201d to cyberhacking in any form.  An Intel spokesman declined to identify the companies it briefed before the scheduled Jan. 9 announcement. The company wasn\u2019t able to tell everyone it had planned to, including the U.S. government, because the news was made public earlier than expected, he said.  Intel\u2019s tricky path\u2014inform enough big customers to head off significant damage while keeping the information as contained as possible to limit potential leaks\u2014continues to weigh on smaller companies that weren\u2019t given an early nod.  Joyent Inc., a U.S.-based cloud-services provider owned by Samsung Electronics Co. , is still playing catch-up, said Bryan Cantrill, the company\u2019s chief technology officer.  \u201cOther folks had a six-month head start,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re scrambling.\u201d  In the months before the flaws were publicly disclosed, Intel worked on fixes with Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google unit as well as \u201ckey\u201d computer makers and cloud-computing companies, Intel said in an emailed statement to The Wall Street Journal.  An official at the Department of Homeland Security said staffers learned of the chip flaws from the Jan. 3 news reports. The department is often informed of bug discoveries in advance of the public, and it acts as an authoritative source for information on how to address them.  \u201cWe certainly would have liked to have been notified of this,\u201d the official said.  The NSA was similarly in the dark, according to Rob Joyce, the White House\u2019s top cybersecurity official. In a message posted Jan. 13 to Twitter, he said the NSA \u201cdid not know about these flaws.\u201d A White House spokesman declined to comment further, referring instead to the tweet.  Chinese computer maker Lenovo Group Ltd. LNVGY -0.87% was among the large tech companies, including Microsoft Corp. , Amazon.com Inc. and ARM Holdings in the U.K., that were notified of the flaws beforehand.  Lenovo was able to issue a statement Jan. 3 advising customers on the flaws because of \u201cthe work we\u2019d done ahead of that date with industry processor and operating system partners,\u201d a spokeswoman said in an email.  Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA -2.21% , China\u2019s top seller of cloud-computing services, also was notified ahead of time, according to a person familiar with the company.  A spokeswoman for Alibaba\u2019s cloud unit declined to comment on when the company was informed. She said any idea that the company might have shared information with Chinese authorities was \u201cspeculative and baseless.\u201d  A Lenovo spokeswoman said Intel\u2019s information was protected by a nondisclosure agreement.  Despite the security concerns, an early heads up to a select number of large global companies made sense, said Dave Aitel, chief executive of Immunity Inc., a company that sells security services. \u201cThey\u2019re going to tell as few people as possible\u201d to contain possible leaks, he said.  Because they had early warning, Microsoft, Google and Amazon were able to release statements soon after news of the flaws leaked out saying their cloud-computing customers were largely protected.  Smaller competitors, though, continue to struggle. DigitalOcean Inc., a cloud-services seller, said Jan. 19 it was still testing a fix for its customers. Rackspace Inc. said last Wednesday it has several teams working on a fix. The cloud company earlier in January told customers it understood the situation \u201ccan be frustrating.\u201d  The DHS also stumbled with its initial guidance. The agency\u2019s Computer Emergency Response Team first linked to an advisory stating the only way to \u201cfully remove\u201d the flaws was by replacing the chip. CERT now advises users instead to patch their systems.  The DHS should have been looped in early on to help coordinate the flaws\u2019 disclosure, Joyent\u2019s Mr. Cantrill said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why CERT would not be your first stop,\u201d he said.

WSJ's David Pierce has a few tricks and tips to pull yourself back into the real world. Photo/Video: Emily Prapuolenis/The Wall Street Journal  When smartphones came to steal our attention, we never had a chance. Even in the rare moments we manage to put them down, they buzz incessantly, begging us to come back.  It\u2019s fine for phones to be engrossing when we\u2019re bored on a layover. More often they should help us work or exercise or find a Starbucks , then get out of the way.  Now, more than a decade into the smartphone era, investors, activists and customers alike have begun to push phone makers, especially Apple Inc., AAPL 0.34% to find a way to solve phone addiction.  The feature we need already exists: It\u2019s called Do Not Disturb. Whether you use an iPhone or an Android device, you have a one-tap way to shut your phone up. Do Not Disturb should be every smartphone user\u2019s best friend and saving grace. Instead, it\u2019s a relic of a long-gone era, a feature that doesn\u2019t work the way we do.  The iPhone\u2019s \u2018Do Not Disturb\u2019 feature shuts off nearly everything. You can engage it manually or schedule your silence ahead of time. Photo: David Pierce/The Wall Street Journal  Apple launched Do Not Disturb in 2012 to keep your phone from waking you up in the middle of the night. When you tap the moon icon, your phone instantly shuts up. Your notifications are visible if you wake up your phone, but it won\u2019t buzz or light up automatically. There are only small nuances: You can name contacts who can call you\u2014no texts get through when Do Not Disturb is engaged\u2014or allow anyone who calls twice to buzz through on the second call.  Last year, the company launched Do Not Disturb While Driving, which engages when your phone connects to your car stereo or its motion sensors detect driving. It allows alarms and timers\u2014and Apple Maps navigation\u2014but generally keeps the screen dark. Anyone who messages you can receive an automatic response.  The problem is that this dichotomy\u2014you\u2019re either on or off, zero or 100\u2014doesn\u2019t actually represent how people use their phones. When you\u2019re sleeping, you might want total quiet. But what about at work, when you\u2019re still reachable but trying to focus on your presentation instead of incessant ESPN updates? Or when the people you care most about would rather use WhatsApp or Snapchat, instead of calling you? Turning on Do Not Disturb is like taking your landline phone off the hook to keep it from ringing.  Apple\u2019s \u2018Do Not Disturb While Driving\u2019 allows you to auto-respond to texts so your friends won\u2019t wonder why you\u2019re not replying. Photo: David Pierce/The Wall Street Journal  Do Not Disturb should have a sort of volume meter, from 0 to 10. When you\u2019re bored on the couch, turn the knob all the way up and let the distracting notifications flow. When you\u2019re asleep go to 0: silence is golden. In between, users ought to be able to control what gets through and when.  At work you need buzzes for your calendar, email and Slack, but would rather not have Candy Crush luring you back in before lunchtime. There should be an \u201cI\u2019m in a meeting\u201d setting, and a \u201cGet me out of this meeting\u201d one, too.  Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google does this better. Android\u2019s Do Not Disturb, launched in 2014, has a Total Silence mode, but also offers Priority Mode. With that engaged, only the apps you\u2019ve handpicked can buzz your phone. My friends can message me on all the apps I use, but Starbucks can\u2019t tell me about deals, and Twitter can\u2019t suck me back into my timeline. Android also allows you to let calendar notifications or reminders through the Do Not Disturb wall.  Google could do more; Apple could do much more. Users should be able to set their own rules. Studies have shown that when people reduce notifications, they worry they\u2019re missing important things. By ensuring you\u2019re seeing the things that matter, and shutting up the (many, many more) things that don\u2019t, Do Not Disturb could address this.  Android users can set rules for \u2018Do Not Disturb,\u2019 allowing certain apps or people through the wall. Photo: David Pierce/The Wall Street Journal  At the same time, Android and iOS should begin automatically managing your phone\u2019s distractions. They could differentiate between morning and evening, weekend and weekdays. Android can engage Do Not Disturb in sync with your calendar events, but it can\u2019t tell whether you\u2019re bored in the dentist\u2019s waiting room or stressing in a job interview. Devices could use their knowledge of your location, calendar and activity to figure out exactly how much you can be bothered.

The California Democrat serves as ranking member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, a powerful oversight panel. Recently this committee succeeded in wresting key documents from the Justice Department and FBI after months of being stonewalled, and Republican staffers have summarized the info in a classified four-page memo. Those who have read the memo say it includes evidence of abuses by Justice and FBI officials handling the investigation into Donald Trump\u2019s alleged ties with Russia, most salaciously summed up in the infamous Steele dossier named for the former British spy who compiled it.  But whether it\u2019s material submitted to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court for a warrant on a Trump campaign official or conveniently missing texts between an FBI agent and his FBI mistress\u2014who both hated Mr. Trump and would each serve on the special counsel\u2019s team\u2014Mr. Schiff exhibits no interest. Saturday on CNN he implied that the only ones who are interested are Russian bots on Twitter .  When CNN\u2019s Ana Cabrera asked him why not let the American people see the info and decide for themselves, Mr. Schiff went full Jack Nicholson : \u201cThe American people, unfortunately, don\u2019t have the underlying materials and therefore they can\u2019t see how distorted and misleading this document is,\u201d he answered. Translation: The American people can\u2019t handle the truth.  It makes no sense. If the American people lack context, that\u2019s an argument for more disclosure, not less. But it fits a pattern. Mr. Schiff tells us there is \u201cmore than circumstantial evidence\u201d of collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow. But he never produces it.  To put it another way, Mr. Schiff appears to be the only man in America who doesn\u2019t seem to want to know whether the material in the Steele dossier is true or not. All along he has stood against getting relevant information\u2014fighting subpoenas for Justice, fighting subpoenas for the FBI, and fighting the subpoena for the bank records of Fusion GPS (which ultimately prompted the admission that the Clinton campaign had helped fund the Steele dossier).  Last week offered a good example of the Schiff standard in operation. Democrats wanted the House testimony of Fusion co-founder Glenn Simpson made public, and Republicans on the Intel committee joined them to vote in favor of releasing it. But when it came to making the classified memo available to any congressman who wished to read it, Republicans alone stood for transparency. Every Democrat, led by Mr. Schiff, voted to keep the memo secret.  On the Saturday following this vote, the chairmen of three key House oversight committees\u2014 Devin Nunes (Intel), Bob Goodlatte (Judiciary) and Trey Gowdy (Oversight)\u2014met to discuss the way forward. They released no statement. But as more of their members see the memo, the rumbling to make the information public will only grow.  Meanwhile, even Democrats not on the Intel Committee have been infected by the same lack of curiosity that afflicts Mr. Schiff. In the few days since the memo became available to every member of the House, roughly 190 Republicans have read it, compared with only a dozen Democrats.  Congress\u2014especially the oversight committees\u2014is supposed to act as the people\u2019s watchdog. Mr. Trump is routinely slammed for his indifference to reading, especially the endless memos and policy papers that find their way onto a president\u2019s desk. But what does it say when the ranking member of a vital oversight committee appears uninterested in what his committee has unearthed about a matter that speaks to the integrity of our highest institutions of law enforcement?  The Beltway standard for comparison for scandal today is Watergate. It\u2019s now been nearly five decades since men affiliated with Richard Nixon\u2019s Committee for the Re-Election of the President were nabbed while breaking into Democratic headquarters at the Watergate complex. The purpose of the break-in was to plant a bug and gain embarrassing intel on the Democratic Party and its presidential candidate, George McGovern.  If Mr. Trump and his team worked with Vladimir Putin to steal the 2016 election from Hillary Clinton, it would indeed be as scandalous as Watergate. But it would be just as scandalous if a Democratic administration\u2019s Justice Department and FBI used unsubstantiated opposition research\u2014parts of which were quite possibly drawn from Russian disinformation\u2014to obtain warrants to spy on members of a Republican presidential campaign.  In 1972, Nixon press secretary Ron Ziegler dismissed the break-in as a \u201cthird-rate burglary.\u201d Today Mr. Schiff routinely dismisses the House Intel Committee findings about Justice and the FBI\u2019s handling of the Steele dossier as \u201ca profound distraction\u201d\u2014while he too fights an investigation into a presidential election. Could that be why he\u2019s so opposed to letting the American people see what he\u2019s seen?

Future cooperation could extend beyond France. A source familiar with the talks said on Tuesday that Amazon and Casino were negotiating a deal in Brazil either partnering or selling Casino\u2019s local appliance and electronics chain Via Varejo SA (VVAR3.SA).  Casino said the process of selling Via Varejo was continuing in Brazil with no new element to report and there was no partnership.  The French move, which is set to shake up the competitive local food retail market, lifted Casino shares as much as 9.7 percent in morning trade amid speculation that it could lead to a bigger deal later on.  Amazon\u2019s purchase of the bricks-and-mortar retailer Whole Foods Market Inc for $13.7 billion last year, and a deal for Amazon Prime to sell products from the British supermarket chain Morrisons (MRW.L), raised expectations that it would bid for a retailer or form a partnership in France.  Casino and Amazon said late on Monday that groceries sourced from Monoprix would be available in the Amazon Prime Now app and website through a dedicated virtual store.  The deal is limited to the lucrative Paris market and its suburbs, though Monoprix CEO Regis Schultz told a conference call that an extension to other parts of France could not be ruled out.

It has a strong focus on quality and fresh products in the mould of Whole Foods, and is a key contributor to Casino group profit.  \u201cWe consider the Monoprix product selection as exceptional,\u201d Amazon France CEO Frederic Duval said during the call.

Slideshow (5 Images)  COMPLEMENTS OCADO DEAL  Casino already has a delivery partnership with UK online retailer Ocado (OCDO.L), signed last year.  The two deals were complementary as the Ocado technology will allow Monoprix to address the needs of its traditional clients with a bigger basket and seeking next-day delivery. Clients of Amazon Prime, set up in Paris in 2016, are looking for fewer items and want express delivery.  Since the purchase of Whole Foods Market, expectations that Amazon could focus next on Europe have spurred French retailers to try to improve their own online offerings.

One of Katz\u2019s early investors was John Doerr of venture firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. The firm was taken by the Japanese idea of keiretsu, a network of like-minded companies that support one another through partnerships and equity stakes. Audible and Amazon.com Inc. seemed like ideal candidates, Doerr told Katz when suggesting a team-up with Bezos: \u201cHe likes books, too.\u201d  Katz on the steps of a Newark, N.J., church Audible acquired and is turning into a 400-employee \u201ctechnology center.\u201d Photographer: Meron Menghistab for Bloomberg  Katz flew to Seattle and met Bezos for coffee. Audible\u2019s success, Katz acknowledged, would rely on an impending internet revolution, where both portable digital media players and the practice of downloading files over high-speed data networks became commonplace. Bezos told Katz he was focusing on selling physical books, because it\u2019d be a quicker way to go mainstream. Audible, he predicted, was an idea that would take a decade to mature.  The two men kept in touch. At various points, Bezos stepped up involvement in Audible, until Amazon bought the company outright in 2008, leaving Katz to run it as an independent subsidiary. By the time of the acquisition, Audible had created a market for book lovers doing the dishes or on a jog. \u201cI began to think you could take all this time, which is dead time, and potentially make it reading time,\u201d Katz says.  As Amazon has in the years since, Audible first built the infrastructure for a novel form of media consumption, then slowly trained customers to adopt it. While the traditional media industry was apathetic or resistant, the company gradually increased the production of its own material. Audible has continued to bet heavily on this approach, starting a division late last year to produce original content on a much larger scale.  Today, Amazon is the book industry\u2019s b\u00eate noire, while Audible and its rivals represent a tiny bright spot for the beleaguered publishing industry. Audiobook sales totaled $2.1 billion in 2016, the most recent year for which data are available, according to the Audio Publishers Association. That\u2019s about 18 percent higher from the previous year and two and a half times the market size when Amazon bought Audible.  Audible accounts for about 41 percent of all audiobooks sold, including digital and physical formats, according to researcher Codex Group LLC. Amazon also sells audiobooks directly through its website and, with Audible, accounts for more than half the market. Audible doesn\u2019t disclose financial information, but says its annual subscriber growth is in double digits. Most customers pay $15 for a monthly subscription that comes with a single audiobook. (A la carte, they often cost more than $20.) The company\u2019s library includes 400,000 titles.  For years, the company operated without any real competition on the fringes of the $26 billion publishing industry. Google and Walmart Inc., though, have recently announced plans to sell audiobooks online. Publishers are growing more aggressive about retaining the rights to produce audio versions of their books, and the price of such rights is increasing quickly. \u201cWe don\u2019t like to work with Audible. Working with Amazon is always a treacherous affair,\u201d says Dennis Johnson, co-founder of Brooklyn-based Melville House Publishing. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly concerned with their dominance in the marketplace.\u201d  Katz says there\u2019s been outcry at every technological innovation in media, from recorded music to the paperback book. He argues the creation of the digital audiobook industry benefited even his critics.  Bezos in 1997. Photographer: Paul Souders  There was an audiobooks market, kind of, when Katz began working on Audible in the mid-1990s. They came as either huge boxes of cassettes or CDs, or in more accessible versions that were brutally abridged. Katz, who\u2019d written three books by that time, was appalled by sloppily condensed audiobooks where narrators adopted the flattest affects possible. \u201cThey did things to books that, from a writer\u2019s perspective, were unconscionable,\u201d he says.  The idea for Audible occurred to him as he was hitting a wall with a book project about how technology was going to change culture. He found the ideas convincing but struggled to write about trends that hadn\u2019t yet taken hold. He also worried that he\u2019d peaked with Home Fires, a 1992 book tracking a single Long Island family from World War II to the early \u201990s. He decided to turn his latest project into a startup instead.  Enlisting the help of a college roommate who was working in Silicon Valley, Katz developed a proposal for a company that would make digital audio players, then build a store of digital audiobooks to download onto them. He raised $3 million in funding, half from Doerr\u2019s firm, and set up shop in a former dentist\u2019s office in Montclair, N.J. It was slow work. By 1999, Audible had about 3,000 listeners.  Of course, in the Pets.com era, that seemed like enough of an audience to take the company public. It raised $38 million in an initial public offering in July 1999, and watched the price of its shares double on the first day of trading. But when the dot-com bubble collapsed the following year, Audible went down with it. In its wake, the late comedian Robin Williams, who\u2019d accepted equity in Audible as payment for his work on a spoken-word comedy project, said Katz had paid him \u201cin Confederate currency.\u201d Nasdaq delisted Audible\u2019s shares in 2003.  By then, Amazon had bought 5 percent of the company, and Apple Inc. provided an even bigger lifeline when it integrated Audible\u2019s proprietary file format into early versions of the iPod. Thanks largely to the iPod, Audible\u2019s revenue surged almost sevenfold from 2001 to 2006, Katz says.  It wasn\u2019t enough. The company had lost money every year but one and lived in fear of a hypothetical well-financed competitor spending it into oblivion. In 2006, Katz began talking in earnest to Bezos about being acquired. At the time, Amazon was preparing its first major foray into digital media with the Kindle. In 2007 it bought Brilliance Audio, another audiobook publisher. In early 2008, Amazon agreed to buy Audible for about $300 million in cash. It was two years behind the timeline for maturity that Bezos had laid out when the two men first met.  Since the deal, Katz has built a prominent profile in Newark, N.J. He gives free Audible subscriptions to public school students, is turning an historic church into a 400-employee \u201ctechnology center,\u201d and enthusiastically endorses the city\u2019s pitch to put Amazon\u2019s second headquarters there. Amazon recently said Newark was one of 20 cities it\u2019s considering as a location. Katz laughingly demurs when asked whether he\u2019s called Bezos to plead the city\u2019s case. \u201cEveryone at Amazon knows my beliefs about Newark,\u201d he says.  It\u2019s sometimes unclear how close Audible wants Amazon to come. The parent company has provided relief from the public markets, capital, and access to its tech. Audible\u2019s engineers got an early look at the Echo speaker to start planning their integration into Amazon\u2019s voice-control platforms, and current and former Audible employees say the connection helped with recruitment. Yet Katz wants to ensure Audible is seen as its own entity with a separate culture. \u201cOverplaying the Amazon part of our story tends to track away from reality,\u201d he says.  In some cases, the company could stand to benefit from greater oversight. In an email to employees last November, Katz acknowledged complaints that the workplace was \u201cless of a safe space for women than it has been intended to be.\u201d Two senior executives resigned after an ensuing investigation, and the company says it will introduce new anti-harassment training, declining to comment further.  Audible is firmly entrenched as the king of its small hill. It\u2019s the only recognizable audiobook brand, and because customers pay for monthly subscriptions rather than buy each book a la carte, they\u2019re less prone to comparison shop. Audible customers, who range from subway riders to folks washing their dishes, spend an average of two hours a day with the app.  The company\u2019s hand in the retail market is even greater than it first appears. For years, Audible and Apple had a deal where Audible would provide the actual files that Apple sells through iTunes, giving Audible a cut of every sale from its most significant competitor. The deal included an exclusivity clause preventing Apple from sourcing audiobooks from other companies, and Audible agreed not to provide its files to competing platforms. Last year the two companies ended the deal after European publishers complained it was anticompetitive.  Michele Cobb, executive director of the Audio Publishers Association, says this is likely to spur competition. \u201cThere are just a lot more players than there were three years ago,\u201d she says. The most powerful rivals may be Google and Walmart, though neither company has yet mounted a serious challenge.  Competition to make audiobooks has ramped up in recent years, adding to Audible\u2019s library. There were more than 50,000 audiobooks produced in 2016, according to the APA, more than twice the number two years earlier.  The appetite for new titles has pushed up the price of audiobook rights, according to publishers. \u201cThe cost of rights has increased in recent years because of the rapid growth in the marketplace,\u201d says Troy Juliar, chief content officer of Recorded Books, which publishes about 4,000 audiobooks a year. Literary agents are increasingly interested in retaining audio rights, and publishers often refuse to sign book deals without them.  If publishers frequently choose to work around Audible, the company has also looked to lessen its reliance on publishers. In 2016 it launched a podcast service. Last year it announced it was investing $5 million in theater productions that could be easily converted into a smartphone format.  David Blum, who spent most of the past decade running Amazon\u2019s Kindle Singles operation, now runs Audible\u2019s original publishing operation. Blum\u2019s official charge is to increase the number of Audible projects that aren\u2019t simply readings of the printed word. Margaret Atwood, author of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, recently worked with Audible to write and record a spoken-word coda to the novel, and comedian David Spade is developing an audio-only memoir. \u201cWe\u2019re really trying to break the boundaries,\u201d Blum says, \u201cand go to writers and creators and artists to think outside the traditional boundaries of what is a book.\u201d", "stock": "AMZN"}, {"url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-04/the-postal-service-is-in-trouble-but-trump-s-tweets-won-t-fix-it", "label": 1, "source": "bloomberg", "date": "2018-04-04", "article": "In recent days, President Donald Trump has decried the financial condition of the U.S Postal Service, which, in a series of much discussed tweets, he has said is losing \u201cBillions of Dollars.\u201d That part is true. From 2013 to 2016, the USPS averaged a net loss of $5.3 billion per year. The reasons behind those losses, though, are more complicated than the way Trump seems to see it. According to the president, the financial woes of the Postal Service have much to do with the deal it has with Amazon.com to deliver the internet retailer\u2019s packages.  Leaving aside Trump\u2019s claims about the Postal Service\u2019s deal with Amazon (which is not a money loser) and his probable reasons for treating it like a pi\u00f1ata (he\u2019s no fan of Amazon Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos, who also happens to be the owner of the Washington Post, a leading chronicler of this administration\u2019s foibles) the president is right to be concerned with the state of the USPS. The question is whether Trump actually wants to fix the agency or simply tweet about it. If he wants to fix it, there are a number of things he could do.  For starters, he could support a group of U.S. senators with a set of postal reform proposals that could return the agency to solvency. In late March, Senator Tom Carper (D-Del.), introduced a bill with a bipartisan co-sponsorship that would move retired postal workers into Medicare, eliminating the agency\u2019s unfunded health-care liabilities and its need to set aside huge sums to cover them. Naturally, some congressional deficit hawks have complained that this would just shift these costs from one side of the federal ledger to the other. Yet the USPS, the second-largest contributor to Medicare after the federal government, has said such a plan would only raise the government\u2019s annual Medicare costs by a 10th of 1 percent.  Ten Years of Losses Net loss, U.S. Postal Service Data: USPS; graphic by Bloomberg Businessweek  The Senate bill, introduced March 22, would also restore half of the 4.3 percent emergency rate increase on items like first-class mail that the Postal Regulatory Commission granted the agency in 2013 only to revoke it three years later. It didn\u2019t matter that first-class mail continued its inexorable decline as more people used email and pay their bills online. The result was a decline in American stamp prices, already among the lowest in the developed world, from 49 cents to 47 cents, which only added to the losses at the USPS.  These are worthy ideas, endorsed with rare unanimity by USPS management, postal worker unions, and many of the institution\u2019s largest customers. Without White House support, however, the Senate bill is likely to wither and die, a fate suffered by other promising reform proposals in recent years. The tragedy isn\u2019t that Trump has yet to express any interest in pushing such ideas, it\u2019s that he appears not to understand how the agency actually functions.  As reported by Bloomberg News, Trump expressed a desire to aides last summer to raise the Postal Service\u2019s rates for delivering Amazon packages. According to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity, Trump\u2019s staff explained to him that the Postal Service is an independent organization and its mail rates are set by a commission.  American presidents have a history of getting involved in matters postal, usually for the better. In 1792, George Washington signed the country\u2019s first postal act, which included lower rates for newspapers in an effort to create an informed citizenry. It was so effective that French political philosopher Alexis De Tocqueville praised the American postal system as \u201cthe great link between minds\u201d when he visited the country in 1831. Trump\u2019s idol Andrew Jackson was so enamored with the Postal Service that he moved it into the president\u2019s cabinet after he was elected in 1828 and stuffed it with his political supporters, a practice that continued for more than a century.  Montgomery Blair, Abraham Lincoln\u2019s postmaster general, introduced free home delivery in cities at a time when most people had to endure long lines at the post office to get their letters. Under Woodrow Wilson, the Postal Service introduced airmail in 1918, clearing the runway for the commercial aviation industry. Richard Nixon signed a bill in 1970 removing the USPS from the president\u2019s cabinet in an effort to remove it from the political hurly-burly and give it the nimbleness of a private company. Unfortunately, it was still subject to heavy-handed congressional and regulatory oversight and often struggled to break even.  In 2006, President George W. Bush signed a bill giving the USPS long overdue power to negotiate package shipping deals like the Amazon one. Unfortunately, the bill required the USPS to set aside $5 billion a year to prefund the health benefits of its future retirees. It wasn\u2019t long before the Great Recession arrived, causing mail volume to plummet.  Decline in Volume of All Mail Number of pieces Data: USPS; graphic by Bloomberg Businessweek  The financial burdens that the Bush administration imposed were clearly untenable. Yet Bush\u2019s successor Barack Obama did virtually nothing to alleviate the situation. During his 2008 presidential campaign, Obama quipped, \u201cUPS and FedEx are doing fine. It\u2019s the post office that\u2019s always having problems.\u201d Postal workers understandably took issue with his remark. Once Obama was in the White House, his administration quietly supported the USPS\u2019s plan to end Saturday delivery, which would have saved $2 billion a year. It died in Congress because it was vociferously opposed by postal workers unions and congressional representatives from rural areas who said their constituents depended on traditional mail delivery. Meanwhile, the USPS\u2019s losses mounted, and it was forced to cut hours at rural post offices and slow first-class mail delivery in a vain attempt to make ends meet.  Presidents no longer have the control over the Postal Service that they did in Jackson or Wilson\u2019s day. Today, they get to appoint its board of governors. That\u2019s about it for their formal powers, but they can use the bully pulpit to push for change. That\u2019s what Trump is attempting to do now on Twitter in his criticisms of Amazon and the USPS. The problem is that he\u2019s focused on the wrong issues. He returned to Twitter on April 2, recycling an argument made last year by Citigroup analysts who argued that, properly accounted for, the USPS was losing an average of $1.50 on every Amazon package.  It\u2019s a complicated, legalistic case based on the presumption that the USPS, which declines to disclose the agreement\u2019s terms, is essentially providing Amazon a free ride on its letter delivery network rather than requiring it to pay the full costs of the service. That notion excites people at UPS and FedEx and their investors, but few others seem to take it seriously. (The conservative Wall Street Journal editorial page, a frequent critic of the USPS, shrugged it off on Tuesday.)  The reality is that the USPS needs more customers like Amazon, not fewer. It\u2019s required by law to visit every address in the country six days a week regardless of how many bills, greeting cards, and catalogs its letter carriers lug in their sacks. With first-class mail and the junkier kind disappearing, the USPS needs something else to put through the network to make money. Postal workers have a saying: \u201cThe internet giveth, and the internet taketh away,\u201d which is to say the agency\u2019s future lies in online shopping. Amazon is the first retailer to integrate its distribution system into the Postal Service\u2019s network, constructing sorting centers around the country to funnel packages to local post offices so letter carriers can tote them to people\u2019s doors. As e-commerce continues to account for more of what Americans spend, it provides a potential path to a healthier financial future for the USPS.  This vision of the agency\u2019s future is something a shrewd president might champion, but it would require Trump to stop making dubious claims about the reasons for the Postal Service\u2019s financial difficulties. He might even admit that he\u2019s been wrong about the Amazon deal. Unfortunately, that\u2019s not Trump\u2019s style.

Amazon has been attempting to curb losses on shipping orders of low-priced items by raising shipping fees for consumer goods suppliers, Bloomberg reports.  The e-commerce giant deducts transport costs \u2014 or the cost of moving a supplier's inventory through its distribution network \u2014 from payments for bulk orders from suppliers.  But, as its shipping costs have dramatically increased over the years, Amazon is looking to shift these costs more to its suppliers, and specifically target low-cost items that are heavy and expensive to ship, like beverages and diapers.  Additionally, the e-commerce giant is planning to make it more difficult for shoppers to purchase single, low-priced items, such as toothbrushes or soap, to encourage them to add these items into a larger purchase. Some personal care and health items on Amazon are already restricted as \"add-ons,\" or items that can only be purchased with a basket size of $25 or more. However, the company is planning on designating more items as \"add-ons\" by expanding the category to include health and beauty products that cost less than $7.  Amazon is looking to curb costs because its shipping costs are skyrocketing. Although Amazon has been working to optimize its fulfillment network through various initiatives, like extending order cut-off times to eliminate split shipments, its shipping costs are still growing in the double digits. Shipping costs reached nearly $20 billion in 2017 for the e-commerce titan, growing 31% year-over-year (YoY) in Q4 alone. As Amazon looks to grow its Prime Now, one-hour, and two-hour delivery services, while keeping its reputation for free and fast shipping on all orders, its move to improve profitability on consumer goods products is a sensible one.  The retail giant is following Walmart's move to aim for profitability in shipping online orders. Walmart has already raised prices for some online goods, and recently began to push suppliers to offer more high-priced goods on its e-commerce site. Although these two companies have been in a grid-lock price war, it seems like they've come to a tipping point in terms of shipping costs.  However, each company's approach has different pros and cons, making it unclear which one will be more successful in optimizing online revenues while minimizing shipping costs.", "stock": "AMZN"}, {"url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-most-desirable-company-linkedin-2018-3", "label": -1, "source": "business-insider", "date": "2018-03-21", "article": "The Banana Stand at Amazon's headquarters in Seattle offers bananas to everyone for free.

LinkedIn considered \"interest in the company, engagement with the company's employees, job demand and employee retention\" to come up with these results.  Amazon is now America's most desirable place to work.  The company topped LinkedIn's Top Companies list for 2018, beating out Alphabet, Google's parent company, which came in first last year.  To compile the list, LinkedIn takes into account things like \"interest in the company, engagement with the company's employees, job demand and employee retention.\" That means the study was not based on reputation as gathered by a survey, but instead on how people actually use and interact with companies on LinkedIn.  Amazon was chosen for its \"endless expansion,\" both in terms of the business sectors it's moving into and in terms of its customer and revenue growth. LinkedIn notes that it is an exciting, fast-moving, and ambitious company where it is always \"Day 1\" \u2014 Amazon speak for staying nimble, fast, and results-oriented.  \"Day 2 is stasis.

Employment is diverse at Amazon. Its Seattle headquarters employs about 40,000 people, but the company also has corporate offices in many major cities across the country. Warehouse employees round out the rest of the workforce, making Amazon the US' second-largest employer at 566,000 strong.

The company's Day 1 philosophy means that things can change quickly. The company eliminated some positions earlier this year while offering employment elsewhere in the company.

To be the first to know, please click here.  Amid President Donald Trump's ongoing public feud with Amazon, CNBC reports that the e-commerce behemoth has been fighting with UPS for the past few years.  The argument seems to be over the United States Postal Service's (USPS) cost structure, which has a direct impact on Amazon, its largest and most highly publicized customer, as well as UPS, which has struggled to lower its prices to match USPS' rates. Amazon's relationship with USPS directly affects the competitive landscape of parcel deliveries in the US, a market in which UPS and FedEx are the dominant players.  The dispute stems from how USPS splits up its fixed costs \u2014 including driver salaries, trucking fees, and other overhead expenses \u2014 between its two business segments. The two units are its letter business, a government-protected monopoly, and the competitive parcel business, which competes with UPS, FedEx, and other parcel delivery companies.  Under the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006, USPS is currently required to cover at least 5.5% of its fixed costs with revenue from its competitive business. Competing logistics providers, however, argue that this low-cost coverage requirement is outdated because of the explosive growth in e-commerce over the last few years \u2014 the competitive business now accounts for 30% of USPS' total revenue, up from only 11% a decade ago.  Last year, UPS argued in a filing with the Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC) that the law gave the postal service an unfair competitive advantage. That's because USPS can cover a large portion of its costs with its letter business, and therefore offer lower prices than other logistics companies.  Amazon routes the majority of its deliveries through USPS as a result of these lower rates, meaning UPS and other logistics providers are losing out on a plethora of business. Moreover, the e-tailer has argued for keeping the requirement as is, saying that a higher minimum would provide no benefits to stakeholders and isn't necessary to create a level playing field. UPS argued in its filing that the postal service's competitive business should cover a much larger share of its fixed costs, somewhere around 29%.  Tensions between the e-commerce titan and logistics companies will only intensify as Amazon moves further into the logistics market over the next few years.Amazon's well-publicized ambitions in the logistics space have grown more intense over the last few months, and will likely only continue to become more serious. It launched Fulfillment by Amazon, which allows third-party sellers to store and ship some of their products in the online retailer's proprietary logistics network, way back in 2006, and it now serves millions of retailers around the world.  Last year, the company started trialing Seller Flex in several locations on the West Coast, which took over management of its third-party sellers' deliveries to speed up delivery times and lower costs, and last month, The Wall Street Journal reported that the company is preparing to launch a stand-alone shipping service for any retailer. Amazon still has a long way to go before it even comes close to posing a direct threat to UPS, FedEx, and DHL, but as it continues to make inroads into the logistics space, it's likely that the company will only further inflame these existing tensions.", "stock": "AMZN"}, {"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/02/05/amazon-settles-tax-optimization-dispute-with-french-authorities/", "label": 1, "source": "techcrunch", "date": "2018-02-05", "article": "Amazon has signed an undisclosed deal with the French tax authorities, Amazon told the AFP. From 2006 to 2010, Amazon operated in France using its subsidiary in Luxembourg. This way, the company could pay less taxes. But French authorities think French sales should be taxed in France. That\u2019s why they were asking for $252 million in unpaid taxes (\u20ac203 million).  Both Amazon and the French government didn\u2019t comment on the amount of the fine. It\u2019s possible that Amazon eventually paid less than $252 million.  According to the company, Amazon has created a subsidiary in France since then so that French revenue is taxed in France. So the Luxembourg issue shouldn\u2019t come up again.  The company also told the AFP that it has spent quite a bit of money in France. 5,500 people work for Amazon in France. Amazon has invested $2 billion in France in total.  It\u2019s interesting to see that tax authorities managed to avoid a public fight. The main issue with those big fines for tax optimization is that they can damage the reputation of a country. It\u2019s hard to invest in a country where you get fined.  And yet, if only big tech companies paid taxes in each country where they operate\u2026 European Finance Ministers have been working on a new piece of legislation to force tech companies a bit.  According to the AFP, we\u2019ll hear more about this new regulation in March 2018. Early drafts suggested that European tax authorities will look at overall revenue and not just profit.  For instance, if a big tech company such as Google, Amazon or Facebook reports $2 billion in revenue in Germany but only $10 million in profit, it doesn\u2019t add up \u2014 when you look at earnings report, you can see that tech companies have quite a big gross margin. So tax authorities will use the bigger figure to calculate fair taxes.  With that upcoming change and today\u2019s news, Google is probably relieved. The company has been facing a huge $1.3 billion fine for tax noncompliance in France.

Today, Amazon is expanding the program again \u2013 this time, to kids skills.  This brings the number of skill categories that qualify for direct payments to eight, including Education & Reference, Food & Drink, Health & Fitness, Lifestyle, Music & Audio, and Productivity, in addition to Games and now, Kids.  Amazon also gave an update on how the program itself has been doing. While the company didn\u2019t release exact numbers, as per usual, it says it paid out \u201cmillions of dollars\u201d to developers in 22 countries, who have their skills published in the U.S., U.K., and Germany.  Some developers have even earned \u201ctens of thousands of dollars,\u201d and a few earned over $100,000, Amazon noted.  The idea to pay developers directly is meant to help fuel the growing voice app ecosystem ahead of broader adoption of monetization tools like in-skill purchases and paid subscriptions.

Amazon Alexa has been a hit with kids, as any parent who brought an Echo into their home could tell you. So it makes sense that Amazon would now want to push developers to build more apps and games aimed at children.  The company also made its platform kid-and-parent friendly last year, with the addition a parental consent feature for kids\u2019 voice apps, which brought Alexa into compliance with U.S. COPPA (Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act) laws.

After its initial launch in LA, Amazon will look to expand it out to other cities, possibly as soon as later this year, the WSJ says.  Of course it makes sense that Amazon would extend its service to third-party merchants working on its ecommerce platform, but the report goes further, saying Amazon would eventually like to offer shipping services to basically any other business, too \u2013 with the goal of undercutting both UPS and FedEx on rates.  This should not be surprising to anyone following Amazon\u2019s moves on the logistics front \u2013 the retail giant has its own fleet of cargo jets, its own warehouses, its own last-mile contract couriers and can even act as an ocean shipping agent, just like both FedEx and UPS. It\u2019s been reported for a while now that Amazon would eventually compete directly with its longstanding delivery partners.

That news helped send shares of both UPS and FedEx lower on Friday, after The Wall Street Journal reported on Amazon\u2019s plans for the test in Los Angeles.  While some pundits have suggested that Amazon is on a course to kill FedEx and UPS, the reality is more complicated.

It helps arrange the transportation of freight across the ocean on cargo ships from Chinese suppliers. It has even taken a more direct role in delivering orders to customers through local couriers.  But Amazon also depends heavily on outside companies to deliver orders. The company\u2019s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, has said Amazon\u2019s business with carriers like UPS and the Postal Service is growing even as the company gets more involved.  Amazon\u2019s own shipping services have given the company a way to keep up with the growth in its business, which is especially helpful during times, like the holidays, when its carrier partners are flooded with packages. Operating its own shipping services could also offer a way to negotiate better prices with outside delivery companies. Shipping costs at Amazon last year rose 34 percent to $21.7 billion, according to Amazon filings.  Steve Gaut, a spokesman for UPS, declined to comment about Amazon\u2019s plans or whether the company\u2019s shipping volume with UPS had changed. He pointed out, however, that UPS reported 8 percent revenue growth and a 4.5 percent increase in package volume in the United States last year.  \u201cUPS continues to support Amazon and all other valued customers,\u201d he said.  Colin Sebastian, an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Company, compared what Amazon was doing in shipping to what it had done in the corporate technology market with Amazon Web Services, its cloud computing business. Slowly over time, Amazon has added more and more features to the service, but they are still well short of the offerings from established providers like Microsoft.  \u201cI think Amazon is going to find different areas within the logistics and transportation space where it can be maybe more effective or efficient than what FedEx and UPS can do,\u201d Mr. Sebastian said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re trying to establish a full competitor.\u201d", "stock": "AMZN"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/29/us/politics/trump-amazon-post-office-fact-check.html", "label": -1, "source": "the-new-york-times", "date": "2018-03-29", "article": "Additionally, in its latest annual report to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Amazon said it paid $957 million in income taxes in 2017. The company previously reported paying $412 million in income taxes in 2016, $273 million in 2015 and $177 million in 2014, according to the commission.  Those totals can include taxes that are paid on state, federal and foreign income \u2014 although the filing does not specifically break down the amounts for each.  An analysis published in February by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy concluded that Amazon did not pay any federal taxes in 2017. It cited the company\u2019s S.E.C. filing in concluding that Amazon took advantage of a variety of tax breaks and credits to avoid paying federal taxes.  Amazon and the Postal Service  Mr. Trump has also previously criticized the relationship between Amazon and the Postal Service. In December, the president denounced the agency on Twitter for losing billions of dollars when it could be \u201ccharging MUCH MORE\u201d to Amazon and other shippers.  It is true the Postal Service has consistently reported net losses for a decade; the last time it reported net income from its operations was the 2006 fiscal year. In the 2017 fiscal year, the agency reported a net loss of $2.7 billion; the previous three years, it incurred losses of nearly twice that amount.  The beginning of the 2018 fiscal year suggested the organization was not turning its fortunes around. In the first quarter, which included the December holiday season that typically brings its strongest earnings of the year, the Postal Service had a net loss of $540 million.  Those losses cannot be attributed to Amazon shipments alone, however, and the president\u2019s Twitter posts have lacked context. Notably, packages and shipping are areas of growth for the Postal Service that have offset its general shortfalls in revenue.

The Postal Service attributes much of its financial woe to a prolonged decline in the volume of marketing mail and first-class mail \u2014 bills, birthday cards and, for example, bridal shower invitations. Its mail business is still its \u201cmain source of revenue and contribution,\u201d the postmaster general, Megan J. Brennan, said in a statement in February.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  In large part because of the internet \u2014 online bill pay, Facebook birthday posts and e-vites \u2014 the volume of first-class mail being sent through the Postal Service has decreased 43 percent since 2001, when it last peaked.  Still, Mr. Trump\u2019s assertion that the Postal Service is leaving money on the table may have some truth to it. A 2017 analysis by Citigroup concluded that the agency was charging below market rates for package delivery.  If that is the case, Amazon, widely believed to be one of the Postal Service\u2019s biggest customers, certainly benefits.  The report estimated that if the agency increased its parcel rates, Amazon\u2019s shipping costs would rise by about $2.6 billion. Some of that money would presumably go to the Postal Service, which in 2014 handled 40 percent of Amazon\u2019s packages, according to one 2015 estimate.  The report also suggested that Amazon\u2019s high shipment volume gives it a greater opportunity to negotiate rates with shippers. Amazon has acknowledged in the past that it has an arrangement with the Postal Service, but it has rejected the idea that its shipments are being subsidized by the agency.  In a 2017 statement, Amazon said that its partnership with the Postal Service was \u201creviewed annually by the Postal Regulatory Commission,\u201d which found its contracts to be profitable.  The Postal Service\u2019s chief financial officer, Joseph Corbett, has also defended the agency\u2019s shipping rates. In a letter in July to The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Corbett wrote that the Postal Service\u2019s \u201ccompetitive package products, including those that we deliver for Amazon,\u201d are legally required to cover the costs incurred.  Amazon and The Washington Post  People close to Mr. Trump say that his disdain for Amazon (and, by association, for Mr. Bezos) is often set off by his anger at negative articles in The Washington Post. On Friday, the newspaper published a report detailing how Mr. Trump\u2019s legal battles have affected his business empire.

Back in the United States, Walmart, the world\u2019s largest retailer, is testing out the Bossa Nova robots in dozens of its locations to reduce some tedious tasks that can eat up a worker\u2019s time. The robots, which look like giant wheeled luggage bags, roll up and down the aisles looking for shelves where cereal boxes are out of stock and items like toys are mislabeled. The machines then report back to workers, who restock the shelves and apply new labels.  At 120 of Walmart\u2019s 4,700 American stores, shoppers can also scan items, including fruits and vegetables, using the camera on their smartphones and pay for them using the devices. When customers walk out, an employee checks their receipts and does a \u201cspot check\u201d of the items they bought.  Kroger, one of the country\u2019s largest grocery chains, has also been testing a mobile scanning service in its supermarkets, recently announcing that it would expand it to 400 of its more 2,700 stores.  New start-ups are seeking to give retailers the technology to compete with Amazon\u2019s system. One of them, AiFi, is working on cashierless checkout technology that it says will be flexible and affordable enough that mom-and-pop retailers and bigger outlets can use it. In the United States, venture capitalists put $100 million into retail automation start-ups in each of the past two years, up from about $64 million in 2015, according Pitchbook, a financial data firm.  Photo  \u201cThere\u2019s a gold rush feeling about this,\u201d said Alan O\u2019Herlihy, chief executive of Everseen, an Irish company working with retailers on automated checkout technology that uses artificial intelligence.  While such technologies could improve the shopping experience, there may also be consequences that people find less desirable. Retailers like Amazon could compile reams of data about where customers spend time inside their doors, comparable to what internet companies already know about their online habits.

Many Chinese citizens have become accustomed to high levels of surveillance, including widespread security cameras and government monitoring of online communications.  Depending on how heavily retailers automate in the years to come, job losses could be severe in a sector that has already experienced wave after wave of store closings by the likes of Macy\u2019s, Toys \u201cR\u201d Us and Sears.

Walmart, the largest private employer in the United States, says that it does not anticipate automation will lead to job losses, but rather that the new technologies are meant to redirect employees to spend more time helping customers find what they need.  \u201cWe see this as helping our associates,\u201d said John Crecelius, vice president of central operations at Walmart. \u201cWe are a people-led business that is technology enabled.\u201d  Some traditional retailers are also skeptical about whether the sort of automation in Amazon Go can move to large stores. They say the technology may not work or be cost effective outside a store with a small footprint and inventory.  \u201cThat\u2019s probably not scalable to a 120,000-square-foot store,\u201d said Chris Hjelm, executive vice president and chief information officer at Kroger.  But he said it was just a matter of time before more cameras and sensors were commonplace in stores. \u201cIt\u2019s a few years out,\u201d he said, \u201cbefore that technology becomes mainstream.\u201d", "stock": "AMZN"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/07/technology/amazon-prime-medicaid.html", "label": 1, "source": "the-new-york-times", "date": "2018-03-07", "article": "Over 68 million people were enrolled in Medicaid at the end of last year, a little over half of them adults.

Amazon has been so successful at attracting upper-income consumers that it increasingly needs to go elsewhere in search of growth, analysts said.

But Sucharita Kodali, an analyst at Forrester Research, a market research company, said a recent survey of shoppers by her firm had found that a majority of American households with annual income over $100,000 had Prime accounts. The membership rate falls off quickly farther down the income scale, she said.  There are a number of reasons that low-income consumers have been less avid online shoppers, including the fact that many do not have credit cards. Some may not have secure places to receive packages.  \u201cThey are still getting used to the idea of shopping online,\u201d Ms. Kodali said.  Amazon has tried to address some of these obstacles. Amazon Cash, for example, allows people to add money to their Amazon accounts by taking cash to CVS pharmacies, GameStops and other retail locations. Amazon Lockers, installed outside convenience stores and other locations, give people a secure place to pick up and return Amazon packages.  Amazon said people can sign up for the discounted Prime membership by going to the company\u2019s website and uploading an image of their Medicaid or E.B.T. cards. Like other new Prime subscribers, they can do a free trial of the service for 30 days.  Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank, said Amazon\u2019s move was clearly a grab for a portion of Walmart\u2019s customers. But he added that he was not entirely convinced that low-income shoppers would be willing to pay a membership fee, even a reduced one, to shop at an online store.  \u201cObviously we\u2019re talking about a few bucks a month,\u201d said Mr. Bernstein, who was an economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R.

In a business environment that demands, and rewards, quarterly profits and short-term strategic thinking, Amazon showed extraordinary resolve in focusing on long-term goals, somehow persuading investors to go along.  Over its first decade in existence, including long stretches where it consistently reported losses, Amazon enjoyed a luxury afforded few companies: leeway.  \u201cI think it comes down to a consistent message and consistent strategy, one that doesn\u2019t deviate when the stock goes down or goes up,\u201d said Bill Miller, the chief investment officer at Miller Value Partners, whose largest holding is Amazon.  In part, Amazon has inured itself to pressure from Wall Street by ignoring it. While many chief executives devote significant time to fielding questions from investors, Amazon\u2019s founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos, is famously stingy about the time he spends with major stockholders. He hasn\u2019t appeared on an Amazon earnings calls in years.  In a 2014 interview with Business Insider, Mr. Bezos said he spent a measly six hours a year on investor relations and then only with long-term shareholders, who have been willing to weather the company\u2019s ups and downs. Mr. Miller is one of them.  Mr. Bezos has constantly reminded the market of his philosophy. Each year in the company\u2019s annual letter to shareholders, Amazon attaches a copy of the very first letter from 1997, its first as a publicly traded company.  Photo  \u201cWe will continue to make investment decisions in light of long-term market leadership considerations rather than short-term profitability considerations or short-term Wall Street reactions,\u201d Mr. Bezos wrote in a section of the letter titled, \u201cIt\u2019s All About the Long Term.\u2019\u2019  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Mr. Bezos has been true to his word. Amazon has reported an annual profit in only 13 of the 21 years that it has operated as a publicly traded company, according to FactSet, a financial data firm.  And its profit margins, already low by some measures, have fluctuated from year to year \u2014 hardly moving in the straight upward line that Wall Street usually likes to see.  Yet investors have rewarded Amazon for plowing its profits back into growing its businesses, whether in online retail, cloud computing or, most recently, in grocery stores, with the acquisition of Whole Foods Market.  An Amazon spokesman declined to comment.  It may sound like a Pollyanna view of stock investing, particularly in a market increasingly dominated by trading algorithms and macro bets on the direction of interest rates. But in the case of Amazon, it is actually true.  \u201cIf Wall Street would allow more companies to reinvest like Amazon, it would create great benefits for the economy,\u201d said Henry Blodget, a former stock analyst, who first came to prominence in 1998 by setting a $400 price target for Amazon shares. (He is now editorial director of the online publication Business Insider, in which Mr. Bezos was an investor.)  The reality of the economy, however, is that most other companies are still playing by Wall Street\u2019s old rules, which demand consistent profit growth.

Last month, Kimberly-Clark, under pricing pressure from Amazon and Walmart, said it was laying off more than 5,000 workers and closing or selling 10 of its factories.  It wasn\u2019t always so easy for Amazon. During the tech boom of the late 1990s, Amazon was one of a number of promising tech start-ups that were losing money. But it showed the potential for longer term profit, as it moved from selling books into music and toys.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  But like the rest of the tech sector, Amazon\u2019s shares tumbled in 2000 and 2001 as investors began to wonder if these companies could ever make money. A young debt analyst at Lehman Brothers warned in June 2000 that Amazon might soon run out of cash, causing investors to worry about its survival.  Mr. Bezos had squirreled away enough capital to get through those dark days. But it took many years for investors who had been burned by the dot-com crash to give Amazon a second chance.  For long stretches from 2002 to 2006, Amazon\u2019s stock price languished, while it invested in researching and developing new technologies and businesses.  Photo  Mark Mahaney, a tech analyst at RBC Capital Markets, looked at the company\u2019s slipping profit margins during that period and warned investors to stay away.  Mr. Mahaney said he failed to realize \u201cthat all that spending on R.&D. was a bullish sign for the future.\u201d He has had a buy rating on the company for more than a decade.  Those long-term investments, which Amazon didn\u2019t detail at the time, eventually gave rise to some of the company\u2019s most profitable businesses, like its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services.  The success of the cloud computing business proved a tipping point. If investors allowed Amazon to spend time and money investing, patience would pay off.  Investors are now awaiting the payoff from Amazon\u2019s foray into groceries with its $13 billion acquisition of Whole Foods last spring. How it plans to integrate hundreds of brick and mortar stores with its core e-commerce business is far from clear.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  By now, Wall Street has been well trained to believe that Amazon has a strategy for Whole Foods and it will take time to carry it out.  \u201cWhat the market finally figured out is Amazon is extremely good at investing those dollars,\u201d said Mr. Miller, the investment officer at Miller Value Partners.  Ultimately, much of the investor confidence in Amazon reflects a belief in its future opportunity \u2014 what investors frequently call a company\u2019s \u201caddressable market.\u201d  For Amazon, the addressable market in retail is roughly $5 trillion in the United States and many times that globally, Mr. Miller said. And that\u2019s not even including the traditional information technology market that Amazon Web Services is attacking. \u201cI asked Jeff what the addressable market is for A.W.S.,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cHe just looked at me and said, \u2018Trillions and trillions.\u2019\u201d  Online spending represents less than 10 percent of total retail spending, and Amazon captures almost half of every dollar spent in online shopping by Americans.  Even Mr. Gillespie, the skeptic, acknowledges that Amazon is \u201coperating extremely well.\u201d But he questions whether years of low interest rates have helped inflate Amazon\u2019s value because investors are so starved for return, they are willing to overlook some of the risks.  Those risks, he said, include regulators deciding the company is growing too large or not paying its fair share in taxes.  \u201cPeople tend to assume away these things,\u201d he said.", "stock": "AMZN"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/29/us/politics/trump-amazon-taxes.html", "label": -1, "source": "the-new-york-times", "date": "2018-03-29", "article": "Lindsay Walters, a White House spokeswoman, told reporters on Thursday that \u201cthe president has expressed his concerns with Amazon.

His comments have already spooked investors, sending Amazon stocks tumbling Wednesday after an article on the website Axios about his anger toward the company. The stock fell further after his tweet on Thursday, though prices rebounded later.  The tech industry is increasingly on the defensive. Facebook is under attack in Washington for its handling of personal data and the social network\u2019s role in the 2016 election. And the recent death of a pedestrian by a self-driving car has renewed criticism of Uber.  \u201cThe general principle that I know deeply concerns the president is that we need to live in a world where the government sets a level playing field between internet vendors and mom and pop stores,\u201d Kevin Hassett, the chair of the president\u2019s council on economic advisers, said Thursday on Fox Business.  Drew Herdener, an Amazon spokesman, declined to comment.  Several current and former officials said that Mr. Trump regularly conflates Amazon with The Post. Mr. Bezos owns the paper privately, separate from his role at Amazon.  Brad Parscale, the president\u2019s 2020 campaign manager, on Thursday channeled Mr. Trump\u2019s anger about The Post in a tweet of his own, saying: \u201cDo not forget to mention that @amazon has probably 10x the data on every American that @facebook does. All that data and own a political newspaper, The @washingtonpost. Hmm\u2026\u201d  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  And far-right, conspiracy-fanning websites \u2014 some of which Mr. Trump is known to read \u2014 have for months stoked the idea that The Post is in cahoots with the C.I.A. because the agency contracts with Amazon to provide cloud-based data storage. Last November, a headline at one of those sites, Infowars, said: \u201cBEZOS & DEEP STATE UNITE: AMAZON LAUNCHES CLOUD SERVICE FOR CIA.\u201d  The Post declined to comment.  One person close to Mr. Trump, who asked for anonymity to discuss private discussions in the Oval Office, said that the president mused about the issue of Amazon and taxes at least a half-dozen times in the last six months. The president has repeatedly claimed that Amazon costs the Postal Service money even though officials have explained to him that is not the case. Amazon has said that the Postal Regulatory Commission, which oversees the service, has consistently found that its contracts with Amazon are profitable.  People close to Mr. Trump say the president is convinced that Amazon unfairly benefits from tax laws. The internet giant collects sales taxes on its own products in all 45 states that have one, but third-party vendors who sell products on the site often do not collect sales tax, a fact that rivals say is unfair. In addition, some municipalities complain that the company does not collect local taxes.  In April, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in an case on whether to allow states to impose sales taxes on all internet sales. Many observers believe the justices are poised to reverse its 1992 ruling that exempted online retailers with no physical presence in a state.

Mr. Trump hears the sales tax complaints frequently during visits with his wealthy friends at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, and in meetings at the White House, several aides and associates said. One person familiar with his thinking said that the president believes many of his core supporters are hurt when Amazon disrupts the local businesses where they live.  The president\u2019s critique is shared by some of his usual adversaries in the Democratic Party. Like many of Mr. Trump\u2019s wealthy Republican friends, Representative Keith Ellison, Democrat of Minnesota, has been critical of Amazon\u2019s growing power in the marketplace.  \u201cThe Trump administration should rein in giants like Amazon because they have an unfair stranglehold on the competition, not because the president has a personal feud with a company\u2019s C.E.O.,\u201d Mr. Ellison said in a statement on Thursday.  There was also some irony in the criticism coming from Mr. Trump, who has boasted about his dexterity in avoiding paying taxes. \u201cThis is the guy who said that not paying taxes \u2018makes me smart,\u2019\u201d said Matt Gardner, senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a nonpartisan research organization.  How the president could slow Amazon, beyond take to Twitter or complain about the company in speeches, is unclear.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  If Mr. Trump were to pressure the Justice Department to pursue antitrust enforcement action against Amazon, it would be a sharp break from tradition, experts say, because the White House has kept a far distance from those cases for decades.  \u201cIt would be a gross violation and abuse of our due process,\u201d said Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute.  But the president has repeatedly crossed lines that his predecessors have observed. In the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, he has pressured Justice Department officials to investigate his Democratic rivals and to abandon the investigation of himself and his associates.  AT&T and Time Warner have suggested Mr. Trump played a role in the Justice Department\u2019s decision to block the companies\u2019 $85.4 billion media merger. Makan Delrahim, the head of antitrust at the Justice Department, has said under oath in Congress that he would not allow the White House to impact his decisions over that merger or any other cases.  Mr. Trump also surprised antitrust experts with his swift decision to block Broadcom\u2019s merger with Qualcomm earlier this month, after a review by a government panel on foreign investments. The president has direct authority to block a merger with foreign companies that pose national security concerns.  Amazon has tried, through lobbyists and outside consultants, to meet with administration officials and members of Congress to counter arguments about the company\u2019s tax collection and its relationship with the Postal Service.  The size of company\u2019s lobbying staff has ballooned in recent years, according to public filings, focusing largely on drones, transportation, taxes and cybersecurity. It has hired antitrust consultants over the past year.  In 2015, shortly after Mr. Trump started his attacks against the company, Mr. Bezos joked on Twitter about sending the candidate into space on a rocket made by Blue Origin, a space exploration start-up Mr. Bezos owns.  But when Mr. Trump became the Republican nominee and then president, Mr. Bezos and Amazon stopped responding to his attacks, seeing little upside in a public quarrel with him, according to two people briefed on the decision.

It has a solid built and a punchy display that makes up for the fact that it runs on Android Marshmallow. You'd be hard pressed to find a better option for less than 10k.  Moto G5S Plus  The full metal shell goes a long way to prove the durability of the Moto G5S Plus and the battery life is commendable. But since it's a budget phone, it's not perfect. The apps may crash on you from time to time and there's significant shutter lag.  To its credit, the phone has dual camera capabilities and runs on stock Android, which has always been a crowd favorite.  Xiaomi Redmi Note 4  If you're looking to spend a little more than the bare minimum, then the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 isn't a bad choice. It has a decent display, great battery life and adequate performance. Overall, it's a solid phone for the budget consumer.  OnePlus 5T  This phone offers flagship performance for the mid-range user. Running on Android Nougat out of the box, the OnePlus 5T sports a great design and built.  Even with an increase in the size of the display, battery life isn't compromised and the fingerprint sensor is a delight to use. It's special because of its face unlock feature that comes with the OxygenOS.  Honor View 10  If any phone can compete against the OnePlus 5T, then it's the Honor View 10. The camera may not match up but all the other features compete head to head.  It's great for users looking for a high end experience without having to empty their pockets.  Samsung Galaxy S8  The Samsung Galaxy S8 is easily one of the best phones in the market, despite it's Bixby feature being a little pointless. But if you're paranoid about your phone's security and don't mind jumping through a few extra hoops to have access, this phone is ideal.  Once you're in, the phone doesn't fail to impress with a design that's to die for along with an exceptional display. Battery life maybe questionable, but between the battery management options and power saving techniques, you'll get through a day of normal usage.  Samsung Galaxy Note 8  Another phone by Samsung, the Galaxy Note 8 is not only one of the more expensive phones but also considerably larger. The unique selling point of this phone is its 'Infinity Display' and the S-Pen to boost productivity.  The 6GB of RAM ensures that you have a smooth experience and the dual camera captures images that you won't soon forget.  Google Pixel 2 XL  The Google Pixel 2 XL may be a little pricey for the casual user but it has the best camera in comparison to any other phone. Its interface, made by Google, is exclusively designed for Pixel phones.  It's big. It's powerful. It will make you go 'WOW'.  Apple iPhone X  The Apple iPhone X has a great screen and it's TrueDepth camera is definitely something to be taken into account. True Apple fans will claim that this is the update they were waiting for but some may find it's price to off putting since it's one of the most expensive phones in the market.

As of today, if you're paying the monthly rate for Amazon Prime in the US, expect to pay $12.99 during the next billing cycle beginning on February 18. That's an 18% hike from the previous price of $10.99.  The price increase also affects Amazon's monthly plan for students, which will also jump 18% from $5.49 to $6.49.  In a email to TechRadar, Amazon confirmed that the price hike only affects US customers.  Fortunately, the annual rate of $99 will stay the same, as will the standalone $8.99 monthly fee for Amazon Prime Video for those who wish to enjoy Amazon's video content without paying for the shipping and other perks.  Amazon didn't give a concrete reason for the price increase, and instead simply played up the appeal and wide range of services available through Amazon Prime in a prepared statement.  \"Prime provides an unparalleled combination of shipping, shopping and entertainment benefits, and we continue to invest in making Prime even more valuable for our members,\" an Amazon spokesperson said.  Amazon also pointed out that the number of items eligible for two-day shipping recently jumped from 20 million to 100 million, and it called attention to original viewing content on Prime Video such as \"the Golden Globe-winning The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\" and The Grand Tour.  Amazon Prime TV shows to watch today  Up we go  The last time Amazon Prime saw a price increase was in 2014, when the annual rate jumped from $79 to $99. The boost was seen as controversial at the time, but, as these things go, it's essentially been accepted as business as usual.  That's partly because Amazon introduced the new monthly plan that's now seeing the price increase a little under two years ago, offering greater flexibility to folks who just want to try out Prime for a while or don't have $99 to throw down all at once.    Unfortunately, with the new price hike, monthly customers will end up paying a total of around $156 per year if they pay the monthly fee throughout the entire year.", "stock": "AMZN"}, {"url": "http://www.techradar.com/news/alexa-can-now-send-text-messages-but-theres-a-catch", "label": -1, "source": "techradar", "date": "2018-01-31", "article": "Amazon has introduced a new feature: SMS messaging.

There\u2019s no word yet on whether this feature is going to be coming to iOS devices or other regions.

If you\u2019re already an Amazon Prime subscriber, then you will have full access to this service.

Now, it can be accessed via the Apple Store, Play Store as well as Amazon\u2019s online portal at music.amazon.in.  Amazon Music app interface  Once you log in to the app, it asks for your music preference. Options include Hindi, English, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Bhojpuri, Bengali, Gujarati and Rajasthani. After this, Amazon Music will curate the main screen, playlists and stations as per your selection.  In case you\u2019re an Echo device user, Amazon Music will able to integrate your playlists and albums in the \u2018recently played\u2019 section. Needless to say, the app can be synced to Alexa, Amazon\u2019s virtual personal assistant.

A nice little plug-in is the \u2018sleep timer\u2019. Choosing from a range of 15 minutes to 60 minutes, the app will will automatically switch off once that time is completed.  Subscription comparison  Amazon Music is a part of Amazon Prime, so it will cost Rs 999 per annum. This may sound expensive in bulk but essentially it comes up to Rs 83.25 per month. That\u2019s marginally cheaper than its competition with Apple Music costing Rs 120 per month and Google Play Music being Rs 99 per month. Apple Music does offer a student subscription, which would bring their cost down to Rs 60 per month, something the other two services do not offer.  As compared to Saavn and Gaana, Amazon music is still cheaper than Rs 1050 and Rs 1020, respectively for the two services.  It should be mentioned that if you have an Amazon Prime subscription, it gives you access to Prime Video and free express delivery options as well.  Content comparison  More important than the price, is the content collection. A service can be free but won\u2019t amount to much if it doesn\u2019t offer the music that you actually want to listen to.  Similar to the approach that Amazon took with Prime Video, Amazon\u2019s unique proposition is to focus on regional content. They have tie ups with labels like T-Series, Sony Music, Saregama, Zee Music, Venus Music and a host of other local entities to ensure that there isn\u2019t any shortage of regional music on the streaming service.

Officials from the Fair Trade Commission, Japan\u2019s antitrust watchdog, have visited the headquarters of Amazon Japan to see if any violations of the Antimonopoly Act have taken place, a government official said Thursday.  Amazon is fully cooperating with the commission, an Amazon Japan spokeswoman said, without elaborating.  The official declined to specify why the government was investigating Amazon. But he said that in general, the commission was concerned about cases in which sellers of goods may face harm from spurning the demands of powerful retailers.  The commission was interested in ways powerful online retailers can distort competition, reduce incentives to cut prices elsewhere and gain an advantage over other online shopping mall operators, he added.  Japan accounted for $11.9 billion, or nearly 7%, of Amazon\u2019s $178 billion in global sales in 2017. That made it the third-biggest market for the company after the U.S. and Germany.

As in the U.S., the company\u2019s rapid growth and aggressive pricing has generated wide ripple effects across the Japanese retail industry\u2014to the extent that the Bank of Japan has cited low e-commerce prices as one reason for the nation\u2019s sluggish inflation.

That scale makes it hard for sellers\u2014already fighting for customers as the population shrinks\u2014to refuse requests from Amazon, government officials have said.  The Japan Fair Trade Commission closed a previous probe of Amazon Japan just nine months ago. The commission said it found Amazon Japan had demanded that suppliers offer Amazon customers prices equal to or less than their prices on other online shopping sites such as those run by Rakuten Inc. or Yahoo Japan Corp.  The commission said the practice could give Amazon Japan the broadest lineup of goods at the lowest prices and hinder competition.  Amazon Japan said at the time that it promised Japanese regulators to stop requiring sellers to match the price offered on other sites. The commission closed its probe in exchange.

AMZN -1.22% is scheduled to announce its fourth-quarter earnings after the market closes Thursday. Here\u2019s what you need to know:  EARNINGS FORECAST: Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Amazon to earn $1.85 a share, compared with $1.54 a year ago. The company has forecast an operating income range between $300 million and $1.65 billion, compared with income of $1.26 billion a year ago.  REVENUE FORECAST: Quarterly revenue of $59.83 billion is forecast by the analysts, compared with $43.74 billion a year ago. Amazon said it expected sales of between $56 billion and $60.5 billion for the quarter, which includes growth from its acquisition of Whole Foods.  WHAT TO WATCH:  \u2014HOLIDAYS: Amazon lately has been demonstrating a little more fiscal discipline, something that may pay off with record profitability in its all-important fourth quarter. Already, industry numbers are indicating a positive holiday season for retailers as consumers spent more, something that should benefit Amazon, which has a 40%-plus share of online shopping.  \u2014WHOLE FOODS: Amazon acquired Whole Foods in August, and the fourth quarter is the first full quarter of reporting. Amazon has so far added lockers for package pickups and lowered prices. Analysts will expect some evidence of whether it is paying off. For roughly one month in the third quarter, the grocery chain contributed about $1.28 billion in sales and $21 million in operating income.  \u2014HQ2: Executives may provide an update on its search for a second headquarters. The company earlier this month narrowed its list to 20 from 238. The stakes are high: Amazon has said it plans to create about 50,000 jobs and invest $5 billion over nearly 20 years.  \u2014HEALTH CARE: Amazon on Tuesday said it was joining JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. to form a new company focusing on lowering U.S. health-care costs. The companies hope the entire health-care project could at a minimum save them hundreds of millions of dollars, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The indefatigable CEO stopped appearing personally on Amazon\u2019s quarterly earnings calls years ago, but he had a clear message for investors Thursday when the online retail giant posted record earnings along with a 38% jump in sales for the fourth quarter. Writing of the strong success of his company\u2019s voice-activated digital assistant technology called Alexa, Mr. Bezos noted in the company\u2019s release: \u201cWe don\u2019t see positive surprises of this magnitude very often\u2014expect us to double down.\u201d  It is unlikely that he means just more speakers. Amazon has long been sharply focused on driving growth with little urgency to boost profits. It has been richly rewarded by investors for doing so. Amazon\u2019s market value soared 56% last year, beating all of its Big Tech peers despite their much fatter bottom lines. For example, Facebook generated about 50 cents in operating earnings for every dollar of revenue in 2017; Amazon generated 2.3 cents by the same measure.  It is worth noting that Mr. Bezos\u2019s biggest gambles actually take a while to pay off. It was 13 years ago today that he first announced Amazon Prime, a membership-based shipping service. At the time, it seemed improbable that many people would pay $79 a year to get \u201cHarry Potter\u201d books rushed to their doorstep. But Prime has since become a must-have for more than 90 million members in the U.S. alone, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. It now generates more than $9 billion in subscription fee revenue per year for Amazon and effectively locks in Amazon as the first choice in shopping destinations for its paying members.  It isn\u2019t cheap to maintain, though. Amazon has since sweetened Prime with services like video and music on demand, putting the company into the business of creating new content to keep attracting users.  There seems to be no limit to where Amazon will eventually spread. The company became a major grocer last year with its acquisition of Whole Foods Market and even has been making rumblings about getting into health care of late. The company even noted the contribution of revenue from its budding advertising business on Thursday.  Mr. Bezos\u2019s ambitions have helped make Amazon the world\u2019s fourth most valuable company and himself the world\u2019s wealthiest person. His third decade at the helm has brought no signs of slowing down. Once-skeptical investors may dread the day he does.

Microsoft denies it had any such policy.  The lawsuit, filed in Seattle federal court in 2015, is attracting wider attention after a series of powerful men have left or been fired from their jobs in entertainment, the media and politics for sexual misconduct.  Plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys are pushing to proceed as a class action lawsuit, which could cover more than 8,000 women.  More details about Microsoft\u2019s human resources practices were made public on Monday in legal filings submitted as part of that process.  The two sides are exchanging documents ahead of trial, which has not been scheduled.  Out of 118 gender discrimination complaints filed by women at Microsoft, only one was deemed \u201cfounded\u201d by the company, according to the unsealed court filings.  Attorneys for the women described the number of complaints as \u201cshocking\u201d in the court filings, and said the response by Microsoft\u2019s investigations team was \u201clacklustre.\u201d  Companies generally keep information about internal discrimination complaints private, making it unclear how the number of complaints at Microsoft compares to those at its competitors.

Microsoft budgets more than $55 million a year to promote diversity and inclusion, it said in court filings. The company had about 74,000 U.S. employees at the end of 2017.  Microsoft said the plaintiffs cannot cite one example of a pay or promotion problem in which Microsoft\u2019s investigations team should have found a violation of company policy but did not.  U.S. District Judge James Robart has not yet ruled on the plaintiffs\u2019 request for class action status.  A Reuters review of federal lawsuits filed between 2006 and 2016 revealed hundreds containing sexual harassment allegations where companies used common civil litigation tactics to keep potentially damning information under wraps.  Microsoft had argued that the number of womens\u2019 human resources complaints should be secret because publicizing the outcomes could deter employees from reporting future abuses.

The nine justices will hear arguments on Tuesday in a case that pits the interests of tech companies and privacy advocates in safeguarding customer data against the demands of law enforcement in obtaining information crucial to criminal and counterterrorism investigations.  The case began with a 2013 warrant obtained by prosecutors for emails of a suspect in a drug trafficking investigation that were stored in Microsoft computer servers in Dublin. The company challenged whether a domestic warrant covered data stored abroad. The Justice Department said because Microsoft is based in the United States, prosecutors were entitled to the data.  The case is being closely watched by other countries wrestling with similar concerns, including members of the European Union. A ruling is due by the end of June.  A 2016 decision by the New York-based 2nd U.S. Court of Appeals siding with Microsoft marked a victory for tech firms that increasingly offer cloud computing services in which data is stored remotely. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration appealed that ruling to the Supreme Court.  Globally dominant American tech companies have expressed concern that customers will go elsewhere if they think the U.S. government\u2019s reach extends to data centers all around the world without changes being made to the law.  Microsoft, which has 100 data centers in 40 countries, was the first American company to challenge a domestic search warrant seeking data held outside the United States.  Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president and chief legal officer, told reporters last week the U.S. government should not be able to act unilaterally to access such data without taking into account the laws and interests of other countries.  \u201cIt\u2019s more likely to be a recipe for international tension and chaos,\u201d Smith said.  Solicitor General Noel Francisco, the administration\u2019s top lawyer in Supreme Court cases, said in court papers that a ruling for Microsoft \u201cwould hamper domestic law enforcement and counterterrorism efforts.\u201d  If the Supreme Court were to rule in favor of Microsoft, the government could still gain access data held overseas, but the process would be more cumbersome and potentially take longer.  Lawmakers are considering making changes to the 1986 law.  Bipartisan legislation has been introduced in Congress to update the statute, a move backed by both Microsoft and the administration. The measure would let U.S. judges issue warrants while giving companies an avenue to object if the request conflicts with foreign law. If Congress were to pass the bill before the Supreme Court rules, the case would likely become moot.  BEYOND REACH  Though Microsoft is based in the United States - Redmond, Washington, to be precise - the appeals court said the emails were beyond the reach of domestic search warrants obtained under a 1986 U.S. law called the Stored Communications Act.  The Microsoft customer whose emails were sought told the company he was based in Ireland when he signed up for his account.  Other companies including IBM Corp, Amazon.com Inc, Apple Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google filed court papers backing Microsoft. Google has mounted challenges similar to Microsoft\u2019s.  The administration has the support of 35 states led by Vermont who say they routinely seek access to data stored overseas, especially in cases involving child pornography.  Several foreign governments, including Ireland and Britain, filed court papers raising concerns about the U.S. government\u2019s position.  Ireland\u2019s government said in its brief that the question of how law enforcement authorities can access such information is already covered by a 2001 treaty with the United States that allows for information sharing and enforcement of court orders.  The treaty\u2019s procedures \u201crepresent the most appropriate means to address requests such as those which are the object of the warrant in question,\u201d Ireland\u2019s brief said.  The European Commission, representing the 28-country European Union, filed a brief saying that when a country is seeking data from outside its jurisdiction \u201cthe interests and laws of that foreign jurisdiction must be taken into account.\u201d  The Supreme Court has ruled twice in recent years in major cases concerning how criminal law applies to new technology, both times ruling against law enforcement. In 2012, the court held that a warrant is required to place a GPS tracking device on a vehicle. In 2014, the court ruled that police need a warrant to search a cellphone seized during an arrest.  In the court\u2019s current term, which ends in June, the justices are due to rule on another privacy issue on whether police need search warrants to access cellphone location information held by wireless carriers. Based on the Nov. 29 oral argument, the justices appear likely to rule against law enforcement again.", "stock": "MSFT"}, {"url": "https://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCAKBN1GW1H1-OCATP", "label": -1, "source": "reuters", "date": "2018-03-20", "article": "(Reuters) - BlackBerry Ltd\u2019s shares rose 4 percent in early trading on Tuesday after the company said it would provide security for one-time rival Microsoft Corp\u2019s flagship Office apps.

The Supreme Court case, which the justices heard in February, stemmed from the government\u2019s use of a 1986 law to seek emails from an unidentified account kept on a Microsoft Corp. server in Ireland.

Sales of all devices are stagnating, but the time may have arrived for a hybrid gadget.  It seemed like such a good idea, in theory. And it still seems like a good idea -- again, in theory.  Microsoft Corp. and Qualcomm Inc. are pitching computers that mix elements of tablets and smartphones. That means, in principle, people will soon be able to buy a device that works like a familiar Windows laptop but with the slimmer and lighter form of a tablet computer plus the built-in cellular connections and long battery life of a smartphone.  You might be thinking, that sounds similar to an iPad Pro or Microsoft's own line of Surface computers. Yup. And all these gadgets also owe a debt of gratitude to the MacBook Air, the skinny, battery-conserving laptop Apple Inc. introduced a decade ago.  There's a reason I'm curious but cautious about this category of devices that blend elements of PCs, tablets and smartphones. There have been cellular-connected lightweight computers on the market for years, off and on, including devices powered by Microsoft and Qualcomm five years ago. They never caught on. This time, though, these hybrid devices are a category whose time has come. I think.  Powering Down Personal computer sales peaked in 2011 and have declined each year since Source: IDC  Even as smartphones have become the most important digital devices, there has been much welcome innovation in computers. New technology from PC chip king Intel Corp. and Microsoft's 2012 introduction of the Surface spurred fresh ideas about what a \"computer\" could be.  The Surface has a touchscreen like a smartphone and a detachable keyboard that turns the device into a somewhat compromised tablet-laptop hybrid. Microsoft sold more than $2 billion worth of the gadgets in the six months ended Dec. 31, and some traditional PC makers have found traction with these combo machines, too.  The Surface was followed by the iPad Pro, a similar tablet-plus-keyboard with the heart of a smartphone. Google software supports stripped-down laptops called Chromebooks that have been a huge hit in U.S. schools. These are all relatively recent and welcome reimaginations of conventional computers.  They're not perfect for everyone or every use, but the mixed-up world of computers gives people more choices to find the right devices for them. A PC-tablet hybrid with a fast wireless internet connection is a welcome addition to that stew of options, although there are unanswered questions about the performance and drawbacks of the new machines backed by Microsoft and Qualcomm.  It's also an odd time to be devoting resources to any new type of computer hardware. Global sales of personal computers have dropped for each of the past six years, according to research firm IDC. The research firm's PC data don't include devices like the Surface that have detachable keyboards. Tablet sales are also declining, and smartphone sales have hit a wall. It's not halcyon days for most companies that make computing gadgets.  Hardware Hits a Wall Global sales of computers, tablets and smartphones all declined in 2017. Change in unit shipments from the prior year: Source: IDC  Still, you can see the appeal of trying new concepts in computing. Even if PCs and tablets aren't growth categories, more than 400 million of these gadgets are still sold each year. And each player in the market has its own motivations. Qualcomm, for example, sees greenfield opportunity if it can displace Intel in more PC-type devices.  The big question now is how much of a push the latest cellular-connected PCs will get from their backers. There\u2019s a lot of enthusiasm for the next generation of cellular technology called 5G, which optimists say will usher in a new era of internet-connected devices of all kinds. Intel said on Thursday that it is also collaborating with Microsoft and others to introduce a line of 5G-connected computing devices. The backing of Microsoft, Qualcomm and Intel should bolster the idea of blending smartphones, tablets and computers. That all means that -- in theory -- there's never been a better, and more confusing, time for the \"computer\" market.

Now, that group is bearing its first fruit: Microsoft Genomics, a gene-sequencing service developed with St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.  Microsoft Healthcare NExT head Dr. Peter Lee says the challenges are hard, but there are lots of benefits, tangible and otherwise, to this healthcare push.  A year ago, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella tasked Microsoft Research NExT \u2014 the company's A-team of troubleshooting scientists \u2014 with a new mission: Take the company's most cutting-edge tech and apply it to improving healthcare.  Microsoft Healthcare NExT head and corporate VP Dr. Peter Lee tells Business Insider that this new mandate was so broad, it was a little bit like being dropped in the middle of the ocean and told to find dry land.  \"There's no sign of which way is the right way, and you could swim really far in any one direction before realizing you were going astray.\" And, of course, he says, healthcare is a field that many tech companies have tried to tackle, and failed. You might think you're making progress, but \"then you look down and see the people drowning.\"  \"There was a time where we were just floundering,\" Lee says.  Now, though, Lee feels like Microsoft's efforts have finally begun to bear fruit, in the form of real, actual products that are making a difference to healthcare organizations, hospitals \u2014 and patients' lives.  For instance, on Wednesday, Microsoft announced the general availability of Microsoft Genomics, a gene-sequencing service available to doctors and researchers via the Microsoft Azure cloud platform. That platform was born directly out of joint research between Microsoft and St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.  Microsoft researchers discuss Microsoft Genomics, the company's new gene-sequencing tool, powered by the Microsoft Azure cloud. Microsoft  \"We already got one product out of this push,\" says Lee.  Similarly, Microsoft is announcing the availability and expansion of other partnership-driven services. Microsoft and India's Apollo Hospitals teamed up for a new artificially-intelligent system for detecting tell-tale signs of heart disease in patient data, for instance; it also partnered up with UPMC for Project Empower MD, a note-taking tool for doctors.  Lee says it's been extremely rewarding: The biggest motivator for his team is getting to make a difference in people's lives. Plus, Healthcare NExT gets to work with cutting-edge technology, like Microsoft's partnership with Seattle-based Adaptive Biotechnologies, which is attempting to use AI to detect cancers and other serious maladies with a simple blood test.  \"It's just cool beyond belief,\" says Lee of Adaptive.  Lee says there are more material rewards, too, as these products open new markets for Microsoft \u2014 important, as some analysts estimate that healthcare cloud computing could be a $35 billion market by 2020.  Doctors, surgeons, and researchers have long needed these kinds of tools, says Lee, and Microsoft is happy to deliver. He says healthcare is becoming a \"very large business\" for Microsoft.  \"We don't talk publicly about the dollars, but it's large,\" says Lee.  Not drowning yet  The key that helped Microsoft Healthcare NExT find its way was to take a bigger-picture approach, says Lee. The starting point was to look at the so-called \"hyperscale\" clouds from Microsoft, Amazon, and Google, and try to picture what the world would be like without them.  With that in mind, Lee says, Microsoft started making bets. The Microsoft NExT \"standard playbook\" revolves around forming individual, internal \"startups\" with their own funding and purpose-driven mandates, so the engineers and scientists on the team got organized and got moving.  Some of those self-styled \"startups\" started using the Microsoft Azure cloud to provide gene-sequencing supercomputing power, resulting in the service now known as Microsoft Genomics. Others focused on neonatal care, or better software for doctors, or improved ways to take patient measurements.  St. Jude researchers use Microsoft Genomics. St. Jude Children's Research Hospital  In all cases, Lee says, the key was for Microsoft to work closely with patients \u2014 as they did with St. Jude for Microsoft Genomics.  \"We appreciate that Microsoft is investing in genomic research and that they took the time to understand and appreciate our unique mission at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital: finding cures and saving children,\" St. Jude CIO Keith Perry told Business Insider via e-mail.  And for his part, Lee says the team has found a lot of \"inspiration\" in working directly with healthcare providers, and the patients they service. In working on Microsoft Genomics, he says, he and his team have made several pediatric cancer patients \u2014 renewing their drive to do better, faster. He says it's \"incredibly motivating.\"  Which is good, because he says Microsoft has \"found its way forward.\" There's no more floundering, he says, just promising movement in the right direction. For instance, Lee's group is now working on an intelligent chatbot for pharmacies that can help patients reorder prescriptions and answer questions about their medications.  As for himself, Lee describes himself as a \"second-year grad student\" \u2014 he's accumulated enough knowledge in the healthcare space to understand what the experts on his team are talking about and make decisions, but not enough to weigh in and participate in the research himself.  Still, he says, he's learning fast. And if he hasn't quite found dry land, he says he's beyond just treading water.  \"I haven't drowned yet,\" says Lee.", "stock": "MSFT"}, {"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/01/18/microsofts-new-drawing-bot-is-an-a-i-artist/", "label": 1, "source": "techcrunch", "date": "2018-01-18", "article": "Microsoft today is unveiling new artificial intelligence technology that\u2019s something of an artist \u2013 a \u201cdrawing bot.\u201d The bot is capable of creating images from text descriptions of an object, but it also adds details to those images that weren\u2019t included the text, indicating that the AI has a little imagination of its own, says Microsoft.  \u201cIf you go to Bing and you search for a bird, you get a bird picture. But here, the pictures are created by the computer, pixel by pixel, from scratch,\u201d explained Xiaodong He, a principal researcher and research manager in the Deep Learning Technology Center at Microsoft\u2019s research lab in Redmond, Washington, in Microsoft\u2019s announcement. \u201cThese birds may not exist in the real world \u2014 they are just an aspect of our computer\u2019s imagination of birds.\u201d  The bot is able to generate a variety of images, researchers say, including everything from \u201cordinary pastoral scenes,\u201d like those with grazing livestock, to the absurd \u2013 like \u201ca floating double-decker bus.\u201d  Microsoft says the bot was trained on datasets of paired images and captions, allowing it to understand how to match up words to images. It learned to draw a bird, for example, when the caption says \u201cbird,\u201d and it learned what a picture of a bird should look like.  \u201cThat is a fundamental reason why we believe a machine can learn,\u201d said He.  The drawing bot\u2019s technology consists of two machine learning models \u2013 one to generate images from text descriptions, and another that uses text descriptions to judge the authenticity of the generated images. The former tries to get fake pictures past the latter, but the latter doesn\u2019t want to be fooled. Combined, the two work together to create higher-quality images.  In particular, it\u2019s good at drawing images from more complex sentences. While other technology could draw a bird from a caption that said \u201cbird,\u201d for instance, the quality would decline if you told it to draw a bird with a green crown, yellow wings and red belly. Before, this would have led to a blurry \u201cgreenish-yellowish-reddish bird,\u201d Microsoft explains.  What\u2019s especially interesting is how the bot can fill in the blanks when specific details aren\u2019t mentioned \u2013 basically, it has a little common sense and imagination of its own, thanks to its training data. In the bird example, the bot will usually draw a bird sitting on a tree branch even if that\u2019s not stated in the text, because the images originally fed to it often showed something similar.  According to a recent research paper, this new bot represents a nearly three-fold boost in image quality compared to prior technology, Microsoft also notes.  This isn\u2019t the first technology to combine AI with art, of course.  The intersection of the two sometimes leads to fantastic results, such as when Google\u2019s artificial intelligence drew those trippy machine-generated images that got their own art show. Google also has a neural net that guesses what you\u2019re drawing and an automated drawing bot, and regularly details the research it\u2019s doing in helping machines learn how to draw.  Facebook, too, has worked on teaching neural networks to make small images of things like airplanes, cars and animals, and even creating your own Bitmoji-like avatar from a photo.  Nvidia researchers created computer-generated celebrities, using A.I.  And there have been a slew of recent advancements in this space from others, as well.  For Microsoft, teaching a bot to draw an image from text completes the circle of other work its been doing in this computer vision and natural language processing space.  This includes the development of CaptionBot which automatically writes photo captions, and a technology that can answer questions people ask about images, like the location or attributes of objects \u2013 things that can be helpful for blind people.  As to what purpose an AI artist may serve in the real world, Microsoft has some ideas.  It suggests the bot could act as a sketch assistant for painters or interior designers, or could be implemented as a tool for voice-activated photo refinement. (\u201cCortana, draw a bird,\u201d perhaps?)  Further down the road, He says that, with more computing power, the technology could possibly generate animated films from screenplays to reduce the manual labor required today from animators.  But the technology isn\u2019t there yet.  If you look closely at the images, they\u2019ll almost always have flaws that indicate they were created by machines, not humans \u2013 like birds with blue beaks or fruit stands with odd-shaped bananas (see above).  However, with its touted 3-fold improvement, the bot represents an AI milestone of sorts, Microsoft says.", "stock": "MSFT"}, {"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/02/14/microsoft-revamps-its-startup-programs-with-500m-commitment-and-new-co-selling-program/", "label": 1, "source": "techcrunch", "date": "2018-02-14", "article": "Over the last few years, Microsoft has launched a number of programs for startups that range from free BizSpark credits for Azure and Microsoft\u2019s developer and productivity tools, to Microsoft Ventures and the Microsoft Accelerator programs around the world. These different programs never quite told a cohesive story about Microsoft\u2019s commitment to startups, though. Now, however, the company is launching Microsoft for Startups, a program that aims to bring technology and marketing expertise to startups and that \u2014 maybe most importantly \u2014 includes a co-selling program that allows startups to piggyback on Microsoft\u2019s existing sales force.  In addition, Microsoft is tweaking some of its existing programs to better support the startups in its ecosystem.  In total, Microsoft is committing $500 million over the course of the next two years to run joint sales engagements and offer to startups access to technology and community spaces.  But let\u2019s get the bad news out of the way first: The number of credits for startups in the BizSpark and BizSpark Plus program will go down (though not for startups currently enrolled in these programs). Microsoft argues that this isn\u2019t a big deal, though, and that its free offerings are still competitive with those of its rivals.  Charlotte Yarkoni, Microsoft\u2019s corporate VP of growth and ecosystem, told me that she spent quite a bit of time with startups in and outside of the Microsoft ecosystem after she took this new role about a year ago. What she heard wasn\u2019t that startups wanted more free credits \u2014 instead, they wanted more help from Microsoft to bring their products to market.  At the same time, Microsoft was also looking for ways to differentiate its startup programs from those of its competitors. \u201cWe started building around this concept of helping to broaden the reach for startups and go beyond the typical cloud credits to how we build a different program,\u201d said Yarkoni. \u201cHow can we evolve our accelerator program and pull that forward and also think through how we can build more of a campus and neighborhood feel.\u201d  The result of this is Microsoft for Startups, which includes a number of different components. The first is an expansion of the Microsoft Reactors project. These are physical spaces where entrepreneurs, developers, investors and others can meet and where Microsoft hosts a number of different social events and classes. Microsoft currently operates these in Redmond, Seattle, San Francisco and New York. It\u2019s now looking to open new ones in London, Sydney, Tel Aviv, Berlin, Shanghai and Beijing, and Yarkoni tells me that it may move its existing Reactors to larger spaces as their leases come up.  Microsoft Ventures, the company\u2019s vehicle for investing in startups at the Series A to D stage, won\u2019t see any major changes. \u201cVentures continues to expand and is run by a team that is very focused on our near-, mid- and long-term horizon needs,\u201d Yarkoni said. \u201cThat program continues on as it is.\u201d  The largest change will come to the Microsoft Accelerators program. This program is now called Microsoft ScaleUp, and for those startups that qualify for it, this program will now include the option of co-marketing and co-selling through Microsoft\u2019s sales force.  \u201cWe tried to build a way to plug our startups into our sales engine,\u201d Yarkoni said. Startups will get all the usual accelerator benefits, including access to Microsoft\u2019s technology and expertise, but in addition, Microsoft is training and incentivizing its own sellers to sell these startups\u2019 tools to its customers. These startups do need to be ready for this, of course, and for the most part, we are talking about B2B startups here that target the enterprise market.  One of the first companies in this program, which Microsoft has been quietly testing for a few months now, is the marketing intelligence platform Affinio. Affinio CEO Tim Burke, whose company went through the Microsoft Accelerator program in Seattle in 2016, told me that Microsoft is not just giving his company a clear playbook to follow, but also providing help with creating collateral like content, case studies and video content. He also stressed that Microsoft didn\u2019t just give him a checklist to follow but that he had plenty of check-ins and meetings with Microsoft to push this ahead. \u201cThe unique thing with this is that Microsoft has this down to a science \u2014 all the way down to the playbook,\u201d Burke said. He also stressed that he has seen a shift in how Microsoft approaches startups. \u201cYou can see and feel the shift,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how the organization as a whole has bought in. Everybody knows the goal and direction.\u201d  Affinio, which mostly targets larger enterprises, has already made a sale through this program, with 20 more in the pipeline. The plan is to push more than 100 sales opportunities into this system by the end of the quarter.  This is obviously exactly the success story that Yarkoni is talking about. It\u2019s worth mentioning that this isn\u2019t Microsoft\u2019s first foray into cross-selling third-party products. It also recently launched a somewhat similar program for ISVs, and it\u2019s taking its lessons from this to Microsoft for Startups.  Just as important as this new project, though, is the overall revamp of Microsoft\u2019s startup programs. Instead of the somewhat scattershot approach it adopted a few years ago, it looks like Yarkoni plans to make this program into a more cohesive project that gives startups more incentives to work with Microsoft (and potentially Azure, Teams, Visual Studio and its other tools) at an early stage.  For the longest time, startups have also been somewhat wary of working with Microsoft, which wasn\u2019t always known as being the easiest company to work with. At the same time, competitors like Google have been expanding their work with startups through similar accelerator programs.

Microsoft, No. 17-2, has been closely watched by the technology industry, which sometimes has a testy relationship with the Justice Department.

A federal magistrate judge in New York granted the government\u2019s request to issue a warrant for the data under the 1986 federal law, the Stored Communications Act. A federal district judge agreed.  Microsoft challenged the warrant, arguing that prosecutors could not force it to hand over customer emails stored abroad.  A three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in Manhattan, ruled that the warrant in the case could not be used to obtain evidence beyond the nation\u2019s borders because the 1986 law did not apply extraterritorially. In a concurring opinion, Judge Gerard E. Lynch said the question was a close one, and he urged Congress to revise the 1986 law, which he said was badly outdated.  Michael R.

Joshua Rosenkranz, a lawyer for Microsoft, said the law was focused on where the information is held.  \u201cIf you look at this statute, the focus is on the storage,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the Stored Communications Act.

But Chief Justice Roberts said he was troubled by the prospect that \u201can email from me to somebody on the other side of the building that is going to be stored somewhere else would be protected from disclosure.\u201d  Mr. Rosenkranz said there was another reason to shield the data.

She was racist, xenophobic and downright filthy. At one point, she said the Holocaust did not happen. But she was old technology.  Let loose on the internet nearly two years ago, Tay was an experimental system built by Microsoft. She was designed to chat with digital hipsters in breezy, sometimes irreverent lingo, and American netizens quickly realized they could coax her into spewing vile and offensive language. This was largely the result of a simple design flaw \u2014 Tay was programmed to repeat what was said to her \u2014 but the damage was done. Within hours, Microsoft shut her down for good.  Since then, a new breed of conversational technology has emerged inside Microsoft and other internet giants that is far more nimble and effective than the techniques that underpinned Tay. And researchers believe these new systems will improve at an even faster rate when they are let loose on the internet. But sometimes, like Tay, these conversational systems reflect the worst of human nature. And given the history here, companies like Microsoft are reluctant to set them free \u2014 at least for now.  These systems do not simply repeat what is said to them or respond with canned answers. They teach themselves to carry on a conversation by carefully analyzing reams of real human dialogue. At Microsoft, for instance, a new system learns to chat by analyzing thousands of online discussions pulled from services like Twitter and Reddit. When you send this bot a message, it chooses a response after generating dozens of possibilities and ranking each according to how well it mirrors those human conversations.  If you complain about breaking your ankle during a football game, it is nimble enough to give you some sympathy. \u201cOuch, that\u2019s not good,\u201d it might say. \u201cHope your ankle feels better soon.\u201d If you mention house guests or dinner plans, it responds in remarkably precise and familiar ways.  marcy79  conversational_bot  Closest match to human speech Closest match to human speech Lower-ranking potential responses Lower-ranking potential responses  Despite its sophistication, this conversational system can also be nonsensical, impolite and even offensive at times. If you mention your company\u2019s C.E.O., it may assume you are talking about a man \u2014 unaware that women are chief executives, too. If you ask a simple question, you may get a cheeky reply.  marcy79  conversational_bot    Microsoft\u2019s researchers believe they can significantly improve this technology by having it chat with large numbers of people. This would help identify its flaws and generate much sharper conversational data for the system to learn from. \u201cIt is a problem if we can\u2019t get this in front of real users \u2014 and have them tell us what is right and what isn\u2019t,\u201d said a longtime Microsoft researcher, Bill Dolan.  But there lies the conundrum. Because its flaws could spark public complaints \u2014 and bad press \u2014 Microsoft is wary of pushing this technology onto the internet.  The project represents a much wider effort to build a new breed of computing system that is truly conversational. At companies like Facebook, Amazon and Salesforce as well as Microsoft, the hope is that this technology will provide smoother and easier ways of interacting with machines \u2014 easier than a keyboard and mouse, easier than a touch-screen, easier than Siri and other digital assistants now on the market, which are still a long way from fluid conversation.  For years, Silicon Valley companies trumpeted \u201cchatbots\u201d that could help you, say, book your next plane flight or solve a problem with your new computer tablet. But these have never lived up to the billing, providing little more than canned responses to common queries.  Now, thanks to the rise of algorithms that can quickly learn tasks on their own, research in conversational computing is advancing. But the industry as a whole faces the same problem as Microsoft: The new breed of chatbot talks more like a human, but that is not always a good thing.  \u201cIt is more powerful,\u201d said Alex Lebrun, who works on similar conversational systems at Facebook\u2019s artificial intelligence lab in Paris. \u201cBut it is more dangerous.\u201d  The new breed relies on \u201cneural networks,\u201d complex algorithms that can learn tasks by identifying patterns in large pools of data. Over the last five years, these algorithms have accelerated the evolution of systems that can automatically recognize faces and objects, identify commands spoken into smartphones, and translate from one language to another. They are also speeding the development of conversational systems \u2014 though this research is significantly more complex and will take longer to mature.  It may seem surprising that Microsoft researchers are training their conversational system on dialogue from Twitter and Reddit, two social networking services known for vitriolic content. But even on Twitter and Reddit, people are generally civil when they really fall into conversation, and these services are brimming with this kind of dialogue.  Microsoft researchers massage the conversational data they load into the system in small ways, but for the most part, they simply feed the raw dialogues into their neural networks, and these algorithms therefore learn from interactions that are very human. According to Mr. Dolan, in analyzing this data, the system learns to perform well even in the face of poor spelling and grammar. If you type \u201cwinne tonight drink resttaurant,\u201d it might respond with: \u201ci\u2019m not a fan of wine.\u201d It can engage in a real back-and-forth dialogue, asking for everything it needs to, say, connect with you on Linkedin. And for the most part, it behaves with civility.  Top 25 Responses to \u201cwho's Adele?\u201d  When Microsoft\u2019s conversational system receives a message, it generates dozens of possible responses and ranks each according to how well it mirrors human dialogue.

Though these conversational systems are generally civil, they are sometimes rude \u2014 or worse. It is not just that the technology is new and flawed. Because they learn from vast amounts of human conversation, they learn from the mistakes we humans make, and the prejudice we exhibit.  Mr. Lebrun estimated that once in every thousand responses, this new breed of chatbot will say something racist or aggressive or otherwise unwanted. Researchers can fix these problems, but that involves gathering more and better data, or tweaking the algorithms through a process of extreme trial and error.  This is a problem for A.I. services in general. More than two years ago, a software developer noticed that the new Google Photos service was identifying black people as gorillas. Google promptly barred the service from identifying gorillas and similar animals, and it has yet to provide a fix.  But identifying and solving problems with conversational systems is harder, just because the scope of these systems \u2014 general dialogue \u2014 is so large. Image recognition is a single task. Conversation is many tasks, because it bounces back and forth, and each response can affect all the responses to come.  For this reason, Adam Coates, a partner at the venture capital firm Khosla Ventures who previously oversaw the Silicon Valley A.I. lab attached to the Chinese internet giant Baidu, warns that building a truly conversational system is far more difficult than building services that can recognize giraffes, say, or translate between German and French. \u201cThere is a huge technical barrier here. We really don\u2019t know how to build a personal assistant,\u201d he said. \u201cIt may not be simply a matter of more data. We may be missing a big idea.\u201d  In the short term, many believe, conversational systems will be most effective if they are limited to particular tasks, like asking for IT help or getting medical advice. That is still a long way from a bot that will respond well to anything you say. But Mr. Dolan believes these systems will continue to evolve over the next few years, provided companies like Microsoft can get them in front of the public.", "stock": "MSFT"}, {"url": "https://www.techradar.com/reviews/microsoft-surface-laptop-uae", "label": -1, "source": "techradar", "date": "2018-03-20", "article": "Microsoft continues its winning streak with the brilliant Surface Laptop, which combines a thin and light design with powerful components.  There is little doubt that the efforts put by Microsoft in hardware design has resulted in the entire PC industry producing better computers. Looking at the Surface Laptop, one could argue that Microsoft has now matched Apple, or even surpassed it in terms of design.  While Microsoft's first attempt at a non-covertable clamshell notebook was released in the US and other parts of the world last year, it has now officially landed in the Middle East. Its appeal lies to fans of the Surface Pro who wanted a larger screen and included keyboard without alienating those who can\u2019t afford the Surface Book.  Without the hybrid form factor, Microsoft has been able to remain focused on creating a laptop above all else, ditching all the frills it\u2019s hardware has been known for since the original Surface Pro. It isn\u2019t too expensive either, but it comes with the catch of leveraging a new operating system you may or may not be familiar with \u2013 Windows 10 S.  For home users buying the Surface Laptop from retail outlets, out of the box, you\u2019ll only get access to Windows Store applications. Business users on the other hand, get the Surface Laptop with Windows 10 Pro, which, an end-user can also upgrade to for free right now. Microsoft has claimed in the past that this offer is set to expire in March 2018, though the exact time and date isn\u2019t quite clear.  That, and all else considered, let\u2019s take a look at how the Surface Laptop stacks up to its main competitors. Could the Surface Laptop finally be the one to give Apple's MacBooks a run for their money?  Price, availability and value  A premium device commands a premium price tag, and the Surface Laptop starts at AED 4,199 and comes with an 2.5GHz Intel Core i5-7200U processor, 4GB of RAM and 128GB of SSD storage. Add AED 1,200 to that if you prefer 8GB RAM and 256GB storage, which is the model we received for review.  The next configuration up includes the more powerful Intel Core i7 processor, 8GB of RAM and 256GB SSD for AED 6,499. You can also pick up a Core i7 model with 16GB of RAM and 512GB storage for AED 8,600, or go all out with 1TB storage for AED 10,599.  Surely, 16GB of RAM will be tempting to some people who want to use the Surface Laptop for running demanding software or multitasking numerous applications at once. Those users will likely want to upgrade from Windows 10 S \u2013 which only allows apps to run if they've been downloaded from the Windows Store \u2013 to Windows 10 Pro.  The price of the Surface Laptop puts it in the same bracket as last year\u2019s MacBook, as well as the HP Spectre x360 and Dell XPS 13, while offering slightly better specs and power for the base model than the MacBook, but less than the HP and Dell machines.  All three of these competitors are worthy adversaries, appearing high up in our list of the best laptops in 2017 \u2013 so the Surface Laptop definitely has its work cut out for it.  The Surface Laptop in traditional 'Platinum'  Design  The Surface Laptop is quite possibly the most attractive computing product Microsoft has ever created and shows that Windows laptops can be just as gorgeously designed as Apple products.  It features a full aluminum lid and body reminiscent of the Surface Book's, which give it a sturdy yet premium feel. While these keep the Surface Laptop feeling light, they also give you confidence that this expensive bit of kit isn\u2019t going to break or dent easily at the merest of knocks.  A cool design feature places the Surface Laptop\u2019s speakers behind the keyboard, using the gaps between the keys as a sort of grille.  It means the body can remain slim, with no speakers to add to the overall size, and this compromise works very well, with sound from the Surface Laptop coming through loud and clear \u2013 though we noticed a bit of muffling when typing at the same time. This may be an issue if you enjoy listening to Spotify while working, but at least the included audio jack allows you to hook up the Surface Laptop to an external speaker.  Those strange strips of plastic on the base? They're Wi-Fi antennae  Speaking of ports, the Surface Laptop comes with a USB 3.0 port, Mini DisplayPort and Microsoft's proprietary Surface Connect power and docking port, as found on other Surface devices.  It\u2019s a shame to not find a USB-C port, as an increasing number of peripherals are coming out with this connection, and many of the Surface Laptop\u2019s competitors include it.  On the other hand, though, we\u2019re also relieved that Microsoft hasn\u2019t followed Apple\u2019s USB-C or nothing approach.  The limited number of ports mean the Surface Laptop can maintain a thin profile \u2013 in fact it measures just 14.48mm thick, making it thinner than the Dell XPS 13\u2019s 15mm, though slightly thicker than the MacBook at 13.1mm and the HP Spectre at 13.7mm.  So, while it\u2019s not the thinnest laptop around the Surface Laptop is still pretty darn slim, and it weighs just 1.25kg, which is lighter than the Dell\u2019s 1.29kg, though again it\u2019s more weighty than the MacBook, which tips the scales at 1.08kg.  Still, it\u2019s impressively light, and easy to hold in one hand. For carrying around, this is one of the most comfortable laptops you can buy.  A comparison with the Surface Book  Keyboard and Trackpad  Unlike the Surface Book, the Surface Laptop doesn\u2019t feature an aluminum keyboard \u2013 instead Microsoft has opted for plastic keys. Before you start to worry that this could lead to the Surface Laptop feeling a bit cheap, it also features Alcantara fabric material, which is imported from Italy and laser-cut to fit the keyboard and which gives the Surface Laptop a very pleasant and premium feel.  The key travel on the Surface Laptop is satisfying, with 1.5mm of travel giving you a decent physical response when typing.  The trackpad also felt good, and the longer vertical size of the body (due to the 3:2 aspect ratio of the screen) gives you a comfortable place to rest your palms as you type on the keyboard.  Display  The screen is a bright and vibrant 13.5-inch PixelSense touchscreen display, which is reinforced with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 for protection against scratches. The resolution is 2256 x 1504, which gives it a pixel density of 201ppi (pixels per inch).  Resolution fans out there (come on, there must be some) will notice the slightly unusual resolution here, which is due to the Surface Pro\u2019s screen having a 3:2 aspect ratio \u2013 most laptop (and monitor) aspect ratios are 16:9 (with MacBooks being 16:10).  What this means in practice is that the Surface Laptop\u2019s screen is taller, which gives you a bit more screen room when working \u2013 though it does mean that if you\u2019re watching widescreen videos you\u2019re going to get larger black bars running along the top and bottom of the screen.

Alphabet, the parent company of search-engine giant Google, became the second publicly traded U.S. company ever to reach a market value of $800 billion Monday, joining iPhone maker Apple. Alphabet\u2019s Class A shares rose 1.8% to $1,164.00.  Meantime, Microsoft was on track Monday to become the third public U.S. company ever to close with a market value of $700 billion, joining Apple and Alphabet. Shares rose as much as 1.4% to $91.23 and were recently up 1.2%. On Jan. 16, Microsoft briefly touched $700 billion before falling back below that level.  Alphabet has already added about $74 billion in market capitalization this year as of midday Monday, while Microsoft is up about $43 billion, a combined total of $117 billion in added market value for the two tech giants since the start of 2018.  Apple crossed the $700 billion threshold in February 2015 and passed $800 billion and $900 billion last year. It hit that last milestone shortly after Alphabet hit $700 billion.  Monday\u2019s fresh highs are the latest major markers hit by U.S. internet giants in the past year. Investors have flocked to the largest technology firms for their ability to grow revenue despite mixed economic data. Some analysts have said they expect recent gains and lofty valuations in the S&P 500 information technology sector\u2014which is up 42% in the past year\u2014have left the grouping vulnerable to a pullback, but technology stocks have still been among the best performers at the start of 2018.  On Jan. 8, e-commerce firm Amazon.com crossed $600 billion for the first time.  Microsoft\u2019s recent rise has come as the software giant continues to prioritize cloud computing. Microsoft\u2019s next earnings report is expected at the end of the month.  Alphabet has surged over the past year as advertisers spend more and more money on its platforms. Google and Facebook controlled nearly two-thirds of total digital ad spending last year, according to eMarketer, and Alphabet has taken another leg higher in the first days of 2018 as Facebook shares have stumbled on speculation that the retooling of its platform will hurt its advertising revenue.

But the measure drew widespread criticism from privacy and human-rights activists, who suggested U.S. tech companies\u2014under pressure in Washington\u2014had retreated on the issue. They also suggested the bill could leave data stored in the U.S. vulnerable to demands by authoritarian foreign governments.  The measure, known as the Cloud Act, would create a legal framework for resolving the frequent conflicts that have sprung up recently over the issue.  It would amend U.S. law to make clear that law-enforcement warrants can apply to data that U.S.-based tech companies store anywhere in the world. But the act also would give companies a right to challenge warrants in court based on privacy laws in the specific country where the data are stored.  It also would allow for bilateral agreements between the U.S. and other countries over how to deal with disputes in the future, including other countries\u2019 requests for data in the U.S.  The issue has come up more frequently in recent years, as big U.S. tech companies have stored more data overseas. One problem fueling the conflicts is that the 1986 federal law in question, the Stored Communications Act, is ill-suited to current cross-border data-storage practices.  In one case pending before the Supreme Court, a federal appeals court sided with Microsoft Corp. in holding that warrants for customer data can\u2019t be enforced on U.S. providers if the data are stored overseas.  The Justice Department and state attorneys general say the lower-court ruling has hindered investigations into an array of crimes, from narcotics trafficking to arson to child pornography. Electronic evidence is now critical to virtually every criminal investigation, they say.  But Microsoft, Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google unit and other technology companies have argued the Justice Department\u2019s position would leave them caught in the middle between U.S. law-enforcement demands and their obligation to abide by privacy laws in foreign jurisdictions.  The Justice Department applied for a warrant requiring Microsoft to turn over email information from an account allegedly tied to illegal drug activity in the U.S. Microsoft handed over some account data that were stored in the U.S. but said it shouldn\u2019t have to hand over the emails, which were stored on a server in Ireland.  The companies say the case ultimately could threaten American dominance in the $250 billion cloud-computing industry, because foreign clients won\u2019t use U.S. firms if their data aren\u2019t protected.  The enactment of the Cloud legislation might leave little for the Supreme Court to decide in the Microsoft case. When the court heard oral arguments in February, multiple justices said congressional intervention would be welcome.  \"It would be good if Congress enacted legislation that modernized this,\u201d Justice Samuel Alito said.  Tech groups criticized the new measure\u2019s implications for privacy in several respects, casting it as a surrender of sorts in the wake of the Microsoft case.  \"The Cloud Act is a disappointing outcome after so many human-rights groups weighed in on the Microsoft case at the U.S. Supreme Court,\u201d said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center.  EPIC and other groups had pushed for many updates to the 1980s-era privacy law, he said, \u201cbut they were ignored.\u201d Greg Nojeim of the Center for Democracy and Technology said the deal gives the Justice Department too much leeway to open up U.S. data to authoritarian foreign governments.  \u201cDOJ could use this legislation to diminish privacy rights world-wide, or to persuade other governments to raise their surveillance standards in order to qualify for an agreement,\u201c he said. \u201dWe fear the U.S. Congress hasn\u2019t done enough to require DOJ to make the right decisions.\u201d  \u201cThe internet industry applauds Congress for including the Cloud Act in the omnibus spending bill,\u201d said Melika Carroll, a senior vice president for the Internet Association, a trade group representing big tech companies. \u201cIt\u2019s critical that we modernize U.S. privacy laws to reflect current realities of how data is stored around the world. Passing the Cloud Act will enable law enforcement to gather data stored abroad for the purposes of investigating serious crimes, while still protecting individual privacy rights.\u201d  \u2014Brent Kendall contributed to this article.

Moskowitz said IBM\u2019s revenue may prove stable or even grow over the next 12-18 months.  He also argued that recently disclosed Spectre and Meltdown processor security flaws could allow IBM to gain share in the mid-range and high-end server market.  IBM last month launched Power9 processors, designed for cloud computing and machine learning, to better compete with the likes of Intel and Advanced Micro Devices Inc.  A fix for Meltdown, which only affects Intel chips, could lower performance by 30 percent in some cases, pushing customers to look for new processors, potentially lifting both IBM\u2019s market share and revenue, Moskowitz wrote.  In a blog post dated Jan. 15, IBM said firmware patches for Power9 platforms were available to fix the security flaws.

The lawsuit alleges McIntyre violated a one-year non-competition agreement and could disclose IBM\u2019s diversity data and hiring plans.  IBM\u2019s stance puts it at odds with trends in the tech industry and broader corporate world towards sharing diversity success stories and best practices, instead seeming to view diversity as a zero-sum game.  The lawsuit is unusual because IBM is arguing its diversity data and strategy are economically valuable \u201ctrade secrets,\u201d a legal term typically associated with closely guarded formulas like that for Coca-Cola. It appears to be the first company to bring such a lawsuit against a rival over diversity efforts, legal experts said.  IBM cited in its complaint McIntyre\u2019s knowledge and oversight of its plans to hire 50 diverse candidates to executive positions and its development of artificial intelligence-based tools to track the career development of women and minorities at the company.  According to IBM, knowledge of this \u201chighly confidential, proprietary, and competitively sensitive information\u201d would allow Microsoft to compete for the same talent and business from customers that value diversity.  Once synonymous with white men in dark suits, IBM created task forces in 1995 to address the issue and soon greatly increased the diversity of its management.  Y-Vonne Hutchinson, an Oakland, California-based diversity consultant and lawyer who works with the tech industry, said IBM has had a legitimate edge over its industry rivals when it comes to diversity.  IBM\u2019s tools for reaching it diversity goals could qualify as trade secrets if it can show they are valuable to competitors, said Villanova University law professor Michael Risch.  IBM said in a statement that it \u201chas a long history of being recognized for leadership in a diverse and inclusive workplace.\u201d  Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft, which is not named in IBM\u2019s lawsuit, said it had no interest in IBM\u2019s confidential information.  \u2018PUBLIC CONDEMNATION\u2019  Russell Beck, a lawyer specializing in trade secrets law, said he was surprised to see IBM make such nakedly economic arguments about diversity, noting that corporations more typically cast their efforts as benefiting society as a whole.  Most large tech firms have long faced criticism for the lack of diversity of their staffs. IBM took a shot at Microsoft in its lawsuit, noting that the latter company has faced \u201cpublic condemnation and class action litigation\u201d for its struggles to recruit and promote women.  Microsoft is seeking to dismiss as without merit a class action alleging pay and promotion discrimination.  Microsoft and IBM both derive much of their revenue from selling software and cloud computing services to big companies, a number of which have said they seek diversity in their vendors and suppliers.  Other tech companies have previously argued for the confidentiality of diversity information, though more out of fear of public criticism and litigation than competition, said John Cary Sims, a professor at McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento, California.  But more have recently embraced transparency. In 2014, Google released diversity data after previously trying to keep it private. Apple and Microsoft have also made their data public.  Joelle Emerson, a consultant who has advised Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and Airbnb Inc on diversity efforts, criticized IBM\u2019s position.  \u201cIf you truly want to build a better industry, sharing learnings is actually a really helpful part of that,\u201d she said.  \u201cUltimately, a more diverse tech industry benefits every company within that industry.\u201d", "stock": "IBM"}, {"url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ibm-microsoft-data/ibm-settles-legal-dispute-with-diversity-officer-hired-by-microsoft-idUSKBN1GH3B9", "label": 1, "source": "reuters", "date": "2018-03-05", "article": "(Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp on Monday said it settled a trade secrets lawsuit it brought against its former chief diversity officer who left for a similar job at Microsoft Corp.

IBM will license Watson Assistant to enterprises so they can build personalized, interactive experiences into their own products and services that appeal to their customers.  IBM's announcement follows Amazon's November 2017 launch of Alexa for Business platform, which enables businesses to create their own Alexa skills for both practical and business use cases.  Watson Assistant has a heightened focus on customization and privacy over voice competitors like Google and Amazon, which could make it more likely to win over businesses than Alexa or Google Assistant.  It allows for personalization to help businesses better tailor their voice interactions . Developers can create custom voice activation commands and triggers for Watson Assistant, eliminating the need for a standard universal wake word, such as \"Alexa\" or \"OK Google.\" Additionally, businesses can train their assistants using their own datasets, making it easier to build actions and commands.

Microsoft  IBM wanted Microsoft to provide games for its original PC \u2014 so Bill Gates took the task upon himself, working late into the night to produce the first PC game ever.  The game Gates and company came up with was \"DONKEY.BAS,\" an extremely simple and silly game about a car dodging donkeys in the road.  When Apple got their first look at the IBM PC, they thought \"DONKEY.BAS\" was particularly embarrassing, to the point where they couldn't believe Gates put his name on it.  It's the stuff of Silicon Valley legend: In 1980, a young Bill Gates convinced IBM that his tiny startup, Microsoft, was the perfect choice to provide the operating system for its new PC.  The problem was that Microsoft didn't actually have an operating system to sell. So Gates scrambled to buy one from a startup working on an operating system called 86-DOS, or \"disk operating system.\" It renamed the software PC DOS and sold it to IBM for $430,000 total.  As part of the deal, though, IBM wanted Microsoft to provide a version of BASIC, a programming language for beginners, along with a few simple games to show it off. What it came up with was \"DONKEY.BAS,\" a silly game about a car that has to avoid donkeys in the road.  It also happens to be the first PC game ever developed. Behold:  (The \".BAS\" part just means that it was written in BASIC.)  Here's how Gates described the process of building \"DONKEY.BAS\" in a 2001 keynote:  \"Actually, it was myself and Neil Konzen at four in the morning with this prototype IBM PC sitting in this small room. IBM insisted that we had to have a lock on the door, and we only had this closet that had a lock on it, so we had to do all our development in there, and it was always over 100 degrees, but we wrote late at night a little application to show what the BASIC built into the IBM PC could do. And so that was DONKEY.BAS. It was, at the time, very thrilling.\"  Andy Hertzfeld, an early Apple employee, memorably recalled the first time the Macintosh team saw an IBM PC and being especially unimpressed with the selection of games onboard. He singled out \"DONKEY.BAS\" as the \"most embarrassing game,\" saying that \"the concept of the game was as bad the crude graphics that it used.\"  Hertzfeld said of discovering this terrible game was made by none other than Gates:  \"We were surprised to see that the comments at the top of the game proudly proclaimed the authors: Bill Gates and Neil Konzen. Neil was a bright teenage hacker who I knew from his work on the Apple II (who would later become Microsoft's technical lead on the Mac project) but we were amazed that such a thoroughly bad game could be coauthored by Microsoft's cofounder, and that he would actually want to take credit for it in the comments.\"  In 2001, to show off how far the company had come, Microsoft built a 3D version of \"DONKEY.BAS,\" called \"DONKEY.NET,\" where the aim is to hit donkeys with a car. You can download a version of it, but it's difficult to get running on modern systems.  The IBM PC. Wikimedia Commons  But if you want to play the original \"DONKEY.BAS,\" you're in luck. MIT is hosting a browser-based version, while an enterprising developer built an iPhone and Apple Watch version that you can buy for 99 cents. You can also play another early DOS game, \"GORILLAS.BAS,\" in the browser.  Gates became a massive fan of another classic Microsoft game: He was such a fan of Minesweeper that he had to delete it from his computer to stay productive \u2014 still, he would end up sneaking into his executives' offices to play it.", "stock": "IBM"}, {"url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/ibm-blockchain-enterprise-customers-walmart-visa-nestl-2018-3", "label": 1, "source": "business-insider", "date": "2018-03-08", "article": "IBM CEO Ginni Rometty IBM  IBM told investors Thursday that it has over 400 clients with projects on its blockchain platform.  Among its biggest clients are companies like Walmart and Nestl\u00e9. It also disclosed a list of banks and trade companies using its blockchain.  Blockchain technology is often associated with cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, but enterprises are taking it on as a new tool for trade and payments.  IBM's foray into blockchain technology is catching on with customers, according to an investor briefing shared by the company on Thursday.  At least 400 IBM customers are now running blockchain-based projects, according to the briefing. Among those customers are 63 that work together with certain themes: 25 companies in global trade, 14 companies in food tracking, and 14 companies in global payments. Some of IBM's most recognizable blockchain clients include Nestl\u00e9, Visa, Walmart, and HSBC.  While blockchains continue to be widely associated with startups and crypto-millionaires, IBM's client list shows that large enterprises are truly embracing the technology.  IBM and Walmart actually launched a joint food safety blockchain project globally last year, which enables the grocery chain to figure out where specific produce originated in a matter of seconds.  Why the blockchain?  Blockchains, the technology that underlies cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, have caught on in enterprise as an efficient and comprehensive way of tracking both physical and digital items \u2014 from inventory to online payments. Often, these blockchains are decentralized, meaning they're spread across many machines on a network. This redundancy makes it difficult for any one party to falsify the information contained on the blockchain.  Conventionally, blockchains like the one that powers bitcoin are public, so that anyone can see the changes that are made. It's an important aspect of most cryptocurrencies that the blockchain is accessible to all, to eliminate the possibility of shady dealings.  But IBM's product, which is built on top of an open-source blockchain called Hyperledger Fabric, uses \"permissioned networks.\" This means companies can have some of the information on their bespoke blockchain be publicly viewable, and some of it locked behind a password or other security mechamism.  A global trader like the Dow Chemical Company (an IBM blockchain user) may want to have an immutable receipt between itself and its trade partners in order to guarantee that no one is being scammed. But it doesn't necessarily want that information to be viewable by its competitors \u2014 or, say, the media.  In global shipping, IBM's clients include Maersk, Du Pont and Dow Chemical. Its food trust customers include Walmart, Nestl\u00e9, Kroger and Unilever. Its global payment customers include Visa, the Polynesian payments company KlickEx, EarthPort, Nab,, BBVA and CIBC. And in trade finance, IBM's customers include Societe General, WeTrade, HSBC, Unicredit, and Santander.  They're not the only ones rushing towards the blockchain, either. JD.com, the Amazon of China, is launching a project to put high-end beef imports on a blockchain so that its customers can see where their meat has been.  Editor's note: The original headline for this story said IBM has at least 63 blockchain clients. The actual number is over 400. There are 63 companies in IBM's blockchain consortiums, which are groups that work together on thematic blockchain projects.", "stock": "IBM"}, {"url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-basis-the-school-where-silicon-valley-tech-workers-send-kids-2018-2", "label": -1, "source": "business-insider", "date": "2018-02-02", "article": "Students at Basis Independent Silicon Valley conduct a science experiment.

Anne McKee started coding just three years ago with a class at a local community college.  McKee was one of three global winners among 17,000 students that participated in this year's competition.  Mainframes are still widely in use at banks, insurance companies, and other big businesses that handle lots of credit card transactions.  You might think of the mainframe computer as long-gone relic of the Cold War. But banks, especially, still rely on modern versions of the old classic: They're huge and old-fashioned, sure, but they're also proven to be mega-reliable.  Fast forward to today, and meet Anna McKee, a 22-year-old college senior at the University of North Texas, who was named the winner of the IBM Master of the Mainframe programming contest last week \u2014 making her the first woman from North America to take the title.  \"I started saying 'oh my gosh' repeatedly and my poor parents who I was on the phone with thought I got into a car accident or something,\" McKee told Business Insider, of the moment she won. \"And then they just started yelling on the other end. They were so excited. It was awesome.\"  McKee was, truly, shocked that she would win. She had only started coding three years earlier, starting with a class at a local community college. She entered the contest thinking she would have a hard time even completing it. She never thought she actually stood a chance. In fact, she only competed because both of her parents work with mainframes, and urged her to enter.  Her prizes: A $2,750 travel stipend to go to the closest IBM head office to meet with executives and recruiters; an HTC Vive virtual reality headset; a \"Master of the Mainframe\" hoodie.  The learning curve  The mainframe might have fallen out of favor, as PCs, smartphones, and now cloud computing give people access to so much computing power in much smaller packages. The problem is that, even though mainframes are still so critical at many businesses, programming novices are getting drawn to the newer platforms, causing a huge skills shortage.  That's part of why IBM has run the Master of the Mainframe competition since 2005, as a way to entice students to learn the intracicies of the mainframe.  \"We really want to give students a learning opportunity on one of the world's biggest enterprise IT platforms,\" Meredith Stowell, director of community engagement and skills for IBM's Mainframe team, told Business Insider.  One of IBM's more modern zEnterprise mainframes. IBM zEnterprise System mainframe  This year saw the biggest turnout in the contest's history: 17,000 students, 23% of which were women, all competed McKee was the only woman to place among the 15 global and regional winners.  \"I had no idea I was the the first female win in North America,\" said McKee. \"I was just trying to do the best I could.\"  Master of the Mainframe  The Master of the Mainframe competition takes the form of three rounds of challenges, culminating in a stage that requires contestants to build their own application by sorting and tracking data from over 600 companies. Contestants connect to a IBM mainframe virtually, from a terminal on their own computer.  Contestants have three months to complete the Master of the Mainframe challenge. McKee finished in two weeks.  \"I worked day and night to complete it,\" McKee said. \"Everything else, my homework and everything, was put on the back burner.\"  In high school, McKee was particularly adept at math and music, but didn't know how that could translate into a career. On a whim, during the summer after her freshman year of college, McKee enrolled in a basic C++ programming course at a nearby community college. She struggled through it, but she was \"intrigued\" and decided to sign up for a class in the Java programming language. IBM  That's when things changed. She enjoyed programming in Java so much, she declared a major in business computer information systems. She also joined the Association for Information Systems, a professional association for the IT industry.  And she's noticed a promising change, too. Over the past year, McKee said, more women have been attending AIS meetings. A few weeks before IBM told McKee she won Master of the Mainframe, she noticed something unusual at the latest AIS meeting: the room was about 50% women.  \"It's something that really surprised me and I really hope that things are shifting so that more women are getting into technology,\" she said.", "stock": "IBM"}, {"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/01/25/ibm-brings-mendixs-low-code-platform-to-its-cloud/", "label": 1, "source": "techcrunch", "date": "2018-01-25", "article": "IBM today announced a partnership with low-code development platform Mendix that will bring Mendix and native integration with many of IBM\u2019s Watson IoT and AI services to the IBM Cloud. This deal is an evolution of a previous partnership that involved what was then called IBM Bluemix (now IBM Cloud).  With this partnership, IBM is bringing Mendix to the IBM Cloud and integrating it deeply with its own tools. As Don Boulia, the general manager for the IBM Cloud Platform, told me, the typical developer on the IBM platform doesn\u2019t quite fit the profile of somebody who would opt for a low-code/no-code platform like Mendix, but this move allows IBM to go after a segment of the developer population that includes exactly this group of users who currently don\u2019t have the option/ability to use IBM\u2019s cloud services (as well as more advanced developers who simply want to build a quick prototype).  By bringing Mendix to its cloud, IBM clearly hopes to attract more users to the wide variety of services it now offers. Specifically, this includes deep integrations with Watson AI services like Conversation for building chatbots, translation services, text to speech, the Watson Tone Analyzer for understanding emotions in text and the Watson Visual Recognition service. Using the Mendix connector kit, developers also will be able to access IBM\u2019s IoT and blockchain services.  Once you start getting into IBM\u2019s IoT and blockchain APIs, though, chances are that you\u2019ll have to go beyond the visual development tools to get the full value out of these tools.  The promise of Mendix is that it speeds up application development by 10x (for some reason, all low-code platforms seem to make the same 10x promise\u2026).

Why does that matter? Running containers on bare metal has some performance benefits and development teams will be able to choose the kid of machine they want to run their containers on. But at the same time, knowing that you are running your containers on a machine that you don\u2019t share with other customers also adds another layer of security and isolation that you don\u2019t get from running on a regular container service.  As IBM\u2019s CTO for Watson and Cloud Bryson Koehler told me, this now also opens up the ability to attach GPUs to these machines, which in turn enables the kind of machine learning and high performance computing workloads that many enterprises are now starting to experiment with. \u201cIf you look at the types of workloads that enterprises are moving to the cloud, bare metal is a huge benefactor in terms of isolation and flexibility,\u201d Koehler told me.

Mr. Vadukul attended Enfield Grammar School, but by age 15 he had decided to pursue a career in photography instead of higher-level studies, hoping to build on his pocket-size portfolio of Kodachrome slide transparencies.

By 1985, Mr. Vadukul was pursuing freelance advertising and editorial assignments in London, and later in Paris. While he continued to shoot ads for companies like Nike and IBM, by the mid-1990s he had moved to New York and was also taking on assignments for the youth-focused magazine Details.

Using Watson as the base of its AI calculations and formerly known as \u2018Watson Conversation,\u2019 the Watson Assistant will be accessible via text or voice. IBM\u2019s partners can also choose to incorporate the assistant into their devices or services.  Herein lies the purported beauty behind Watson Assistant.  IBM isn\u2019t tying its Watson Assistant to any one device or category, but rather licensing out the technology to its countless business partners to implement into their own products and services. With this, IBM\u2019s goal is to get Watson into all sorts of artificial intelligence or machine learning applications.  Whether in your smart home or in your car \u2013 as IBM demonstrated at its inaugural Think conference in Las Vegas through a concept Maserati GranCabrio\u2019s digital cockpit, Engadget reports \u2013 or even in your hotel room, the idea is for Watson to make those experiences easier.  For instance, in IBM\u2019s example scenario a Watson-powered hotel automatically checks in guests while the room spools up the user\u2019s favorite music and temperature preference; the service could also supply users with a rental car before their arrival. In this scenario, you\u2019d unlock your hotel door with an electronic key in your phone, natch.  The guerrilla fighter in the smart assistant wars  This is clearly IBM\u2019s move to beat its more consumer-bent competitors to a smart assistant for commercial partners, and a follow-up to its Watson for Cybersecurity service. Smart assistants like Amazon\u2019s Alexa and Google\u2019s Assistant may have all but conquered the smartphone, tablet, and corners of the smart home, but not so the professional world.  That\u2019s because these assistants have only recently began branching out into other products, almost all of which are consumer-oriented devices and services. Watson Assistant, on the other hand, was built expressly to power businesses\u2019 smart assistant efforts.  On top of that, IBM touts that its approach to smart assistants is, well, smarter, with Watson Assistant promising to learn from your commands and actions and how you carry them out, remembering your preferences. If you allow these Watson-based devices or services to share data over the IBM Cloud that makes the assistant work, Watson Assistant can engage in more realistic conversations with context.  Of course, this assumes mass adoption, not to mention your comfort level with Watson-based services and products sharing your data amongst themselves. IBM promises that Watson is ready and able to protect your data, naturally.  We\u2019ll have to wait some time to see whether Watson Assistant can present a challenged to Alexa and Google Assistant, especially in the car and home categories. Regardless, more choice never hurt anyone.", "stock": "IBM"}, {"url": "https://www.engadget.com/2018/01/24/ibm-watson-grammys/", "label": 1, "source": "engadget", "date": "2018-01-24", "article": "IBM and the Recording Academy announced their partnership to use the Watson Media suite at the Grammys today. Want to quickly see who has the coolest looks on the red carpet? Want to gain AI-generated insights into the \"emotional tone\" of songs by this year's nominees? Watson's got you covered.  Behind the scenes, Watson's AI will be used to help streamline the academy's digital workflow. In the past, the Grammys relied on third-party photography services to aggregate and distribute images from the five-and-a-half-hour red carpet pre-show. This process is cumbersome and much too slow in a social-media-fueled era of instant gratification. But with thousands of photos taken at the red carpet each year, manually sorting, tagging and tweeting is pretty much a nonstarter. So Watson is stepping in to make the Recording Academy's life much easier.  \"At the end of the day, it really boils down -- especially on Grammy Sunday -- to making sure the fan experience is as deep and as engaging as it possibly can be,\" Evan Greene, the Recording Academy's chief marketing officer, told Engadget.  Greene added that the academy's partnership with IBM offers an opportunity to use Watson's ever-expanding platform of services to synthesize all the information coming out of the red carpet in a digestible way. It's just the latest example of IBM using Watson to enhance fan experiences for major live events. For instance, Watson's capabilities were used to generate tennis highlight videos at the US Open last year.  For Grammy night, IBM created a system that ingests red carpet images from Getty and analyzes them in real time to identify the people in the photos, the colors of the outfits being worn and the people's emotions. This information is then added to the metadata for each image as the Academy sends them out to the media and through its own social channels.  Watson will also cross-reference outfits worn this year with looks from red carpets past, giving fans a connection to some of their favorite moments in the show's history, said John Kent, the program manager for IBM Worldwide Sponsorship Marketing.  The company's Watson Tone Analyzer API will also analyze the lyrics of nominated tunes and albums and group them into five categories: joy, fear, disgust, anger and sadness. As with the red carpet looks, these will be compared to past music from this year's nominees, Kent added.  IBM and the academy launched a website where fans can check out these features over the course of Sunday's red carpet show. The goal is to make watching the Grammys feel more interactive for viewers, said Noah Syken, vice president for sports and partnerships at IBM. By digging into past awards looks and getting a better understanding of the musicality of nominated songs, fans can have a better understanding of this year's nominees and where they fall in the Grammys' storied pop culture history.  So what is the development process like for adapting Watson's capabilities to an event like this? For Kent, it involves an assessment of what Watson can and cannot do, and how it could be most useful to a client like the Recording Academy.  \"We do an overview of what Watson is and what Watson isn't. What are the challenges? What is the audience? The big challenge with the red carpet is 'how can we help the Recording Academy deal with the hundreds of thousands of photos taken on the red carpet?'\" Kent said. \"So in developing programs, we always make sure we are checking efficiency boxes and checking fan-experience boxes and making those happen.\"  It essentially boils down to \"getting the most value out of the data\" being gathered, Syken added.  Kent said that just as with serving up real-time highlights for US Open fans, Watson's visit to the Grammys red carpet offers a template for how this kind of data analysis could be used for less-splashy projects.  While this time Watson is being used to contextualize viral pop culture moments, Kent stressed that the supercomputer's suite of programs can be applied to any number of businesses. In the past, Watson's ability to aggregate and interpret large swaths of data has been used to create innovative recipes and even diagnose a rare form of leukemia.  \"It's important for Watson to help real businesses, and that's really what we are doing here,\" he said. \"The Grammys happen to be a great cultural experience, but it all goes back to 'how is Watson going to drive new value for partners and clients? How will they be able to harness insights from all these photos, for instance, to create all these new experiences? To create meaningful experiences?'\"  When Watson first won Jeopardy in 2011, the capabilities of artificial intelligence weren't obvious to much of the public. But after its time in the spotlight on a game show stage, suddenly what once felt like science fiction became accessible. Flash forward seven years and Syken said that partnerships like this one at the Grammys continue to underscore just how useful AI can be. We'll have to wait and see where Watson goes next.", "stock": "IBM"}, {"url": "https://www.engadget.com/2018/02/16/how-security-became-more-important-than-convenience/", "label": 0, "source": "engadget", "date": "2018-02-16", "article": "According to IBM Security's new \"Future of Identity Study,\" users of both mobile and desktop are wide awake to what's happening with each new high profile breach, and it's made them change their priorities. Strong security and privacy are now at the forefront of the average user's concerns, especially when it comes to banking, financial, online marketplaces, and their email accounts.  That's a sharp contrast to research from Gartner in 2008, which also surveyed 4,000 people and found that most consumers didn't want to change the way they did passwords or security, and were highly resistant to using password managers or adopting additional security measures around log-ins.  \"Despite widespread security concerns,\" Gartner concluded ten years ago, \"consumers continue to rely on service providers to protect their safety and persist in using unsafe password management practices, preferring to maintain the status quo rather than exploring new security methods.\"  IBM's 2018 report surveyed nearly 4,000 adults from around the world. Most respondents were in the US. Over half said they would never trade security for convenience. Like, never.  That sentiment increased with age. IBM's findings showed that 53 percent of 18-23 year olds were in the \"no trade-offs\" camp, whereas this sentiment increased in older people. At the end of the spectrum where the olds were, 84 percent of people 55 and older said that nope, they'd never ever sacrifice security for convenience.  Sadly it was only people who said this, and not corporations, who are sometimes people, but are always sacrificing our security for their convenience.  Additionally, IBM found that 74 percent of consumers said they'd prefer to use extra security like two-factor authentication, extra passwords, or any other additional step for added protection. If they could, they would. Interestingly, the study said that \"36 percent of those ages 18 - 20 say they use password managers to keep passwords and avoid having to memorize them, compared to only 26 percent of users in the general population.\"  It all comes down to trust. Between Yahoo's flaming 3 billion user security disaster, Equifax's negligent ongoing dumpster fire, and Facebook's endless compromises of our personal security, consumers have turned a corner from thinking that large companies have their security acts together.  Perhaps what's surprising is not that people would choose better security over letting some company make their logins \"frictionless,\" but that they're willing to do something about it. That includes rage-quitting whoever screwed up their security. IBM's report found that in the wake of a breach, one in five users will stop using an affected app or service, or move to a competitor's service. The younger the user, the more likely they'll dump whoever got breached and take their trust somewhere else.  I can only imagine the amount of resentment building against companies people can't switch away from, like Equifax, Anthem (BlueCross BlueShield), or government agencies such as the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).  The debate about trade-offs between security and convenience is an old one. But now it looks like the idea that users do whatever is easiest is just as dated. Now people know the risks. And no one trusts companies with their security or privacy anymore.  \"For apps related to finances (banking, investing and budgeting),\" the study detailed, \"people vastly ranked security as top priority (70 percent on average) over privacy or convenience (16 percent and 14 percent respectively) -- yet when it came to social media, convenience took a slight lead (36 percent convenience, 34 percent security, 30 percent privacy).\"  One of the extra security steps making its way into mainstream use is biometrics, like fingerprint, face, retina, and palm scanning. Samsung is working on phones that scan your palm; LG wants to use your voice; the Galaxy S8 already uses retinal scans. A Dubai airport plans to replace security counters with facial recognition scans. Mastercard is adding fingerprint scanners to its credit cards. And of course, flagship Androids and iPhones all come with fingerprint and Face ID options.  It's all been met with conflicting reactions of excitement and anxiety from consumers, security professionals, and privacy pundits. Their concerns are all well-founded, and as my colleague Cherlynn Low put it, \"After Apple first put Touch ID on the iPhone 5s in 2013, people pointed out that it didn't work very well and that it wasn't secure.\"  Yet IBM's study shows biometric security to be an inevitability consumers are starting to embrace. Its data showed that 67 percent of respondents are comfortable with using biometrics for security, with a whopping 87 percent willing to consider using different types of biometric authentication in the future.  Even still, everyone's biggest concerns with biometrics are privacy and security. According to IBM, 55 percent of respondents are worried about how their data will be collected and used, with 50 percent saying they're concerned about people using faked biometric credentials to break into their accounts.  So maybe it's time for companies and their infosec advisors to start trusting users with more options for individuating the ways we can lock down our own security on their services. Instead of trying to corral us into whatever must-be-numbers-and-letters half-baked password recipe voodoo they think is best. While their own IT decision makers bump around in the dark prioritizing patches instead of actually applying them. I dunno. It's just a thought.

Many people are waiting [for] me to announce that we are, uh, partnership with a carrier. Many of you guys have seen the newspapers that something is happened. That, uh, unfortunately this time, we cannot, uh, have this, uh, uh, to sell this phone, you know, from the carrier channel.\" Yu laughs nervously as he says this. \"Everybody knows that in the US market, that, uh ... over 90 percent of smartphones are sold by the carrier channels,\" he adds. Whether it's due to nerves or frustration, his almost-candid rantlet is refreshing, his motivation clear. Yu has had enough.  For years, Huawei has made phones that are well-received by global and American media alike. In the US, however, the company's devices are consistently criticized for not being sold through a carrier. Like Yu says, a vast majority of phones bought in the US are from carriers, and the apparent inability to make a phone that passes stringent carrier requirements not only limits Huawei's access to American customers but also makes the company seem incompetent.  The thing is, Huawei is anything but. In recent years, its phones have greatly improved in quality, especially when it comes to design. It seemed to have finally gained enough momentum to achieve carrier buy-in, with multiple reports saying the company had clinched AT&T's approval to sell the Mate 10 Pro. Yu's speech seems to confirm this, although he never mentions the reason for the dissolution of the partnership. The Information reported that political reasons were behind the last-minute pullout while Reuters said shortly after that Congress lobbied for AT&T to drop the deal.  In its official statement, Huawei doesn't directly address the deal and why it fell through. \"We have the strongest confidence in our products and will continue to innovate and break new ground. At the same time, we believe that U.S. consumers deserve equal opportunity and the choice to enjoy the best technology and more smartphone options through more channels, just like other satisfied Huawei users around the world,\" the company writes.  Huawei isn't the only major Chinese company with its eyes locked on America. Baidu, which is Google's equivalent in China, showed off a trio of smart speakers at CES, and company reps told Engadget that it definitely wants to bring its products to the US. Alibaba, also known as China's Amazon, also wants to establish a presence in America. But there are many challenges clouding these companies' ability to forecast a timeline.  In Baidu's case, tweaking its smart speakers for the US involves a complete overhaul. Its natural language interface DuerOS not only needs to be tailored for different consumer behavior but also has to learn an entirely new language (and all the associated nuances). Basically, American and Chinese people have different habits and tastes, and a product for one market cannot simply be reskinned to suit the other.  Chinese companies simply don't have a good reputation in the US.  Chinese companies also frequently have names that Americans find hard to pronounce, like Xiaomi and Huawei. This affects the consumer's ability to recall the brand when deciding what to buy, making it even more difficult for Chinese companies to appeal to the US market. The problem is so bad that Huawei has had to launch a massive ad campaign teaching Americans how to pronounce its name (\"who-ah way\" in Chinese, \"wah-way\" in Cantonese, \"wow way\" in the company's unfortunately inaccurate marketing material). Xiaomi, which is frequently mispronounced as \"show-me\" actually sounds closer to \"see-ow me.\"  But it's not just language and cultural differences that get in the way. Chinese companies simply don't have a good reputation in the US. Right after Yu's press conference at CES, Congress quickly proposed a bill to ban government agencies from working with Huawei and ZTE. These two companies were also the subject of a 2012 report from Congress claiming they \"cannot be trusted.\"  Huawei writes in its official statement that \"privacy and security are always our first priority. We are compliant with the world's most stringent privacy protection frameworks, including all GAPP and GDPR privacy protection requirements.\" Both ZTE and Huawei also stated back in 2012 that they felt they were being unfairly singled out in Congress' inquiry.", "stock": "IBM"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/maersk-and-ibm-partner-on-blockchain-for-global-trade-1516111543", "label": 1, "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "date": "2018-01-16", "article": "Shipping giant A.P.

More corporations, including General Motors Co. and Procter & Gamble Co. , have expressed interest in the platform and are exploring ways to use it to streamline supply chains and customs clearance. Singaporean and Peruvian customs also are exploring collaborating with the platform to facilitate trade flows and enhance supply chain security.  The move comes as Maersk and IBM have been attempting to reinvent themselves. IBM, the 106-year-old technology giant, has been looking to new lines of business including blockchain as sales in its legacy business of selling hardware and software slow. Maersk has been trying to transform itself to into a global supply-chain major like United Parcel Service Inc. and FedEx Corp. by integrating its transport and logistics units and spinning off its oil business.  The new company will be headquartered in the New York metropolitan area and led by former president of Maersk Line in North America Michael White.  Solutions from the joint venture are expected to become available within six months of regulatory clearance.

A bit of growth, as it turns out, isn\u2019t quite enough to assuage concerns about how the company gets there. Fourth-quarter gross margins slipped below the 50% line for the first time in five years for what is typically the company\u2019s strongest seasonal period. And, while IBM did project annual revenue growth for 2018, it is unclear if the company can do that without continued help from favorable exchange rates.  Given that IBM\u2019s stock had jumped more than 15% since its last quarterly report, some disappointment was bound to set in.

Blockchain has the power to transform all these industries for three reasons. First, it\u2019s genuinely well-suited to transactions that require trust and a permanent record. Second, blockchain typically requires the cooperation of many different parties. In cases where it\u2019s implemented as open source software, it avoids the collective-action problem\u2014the disincentives that prevent individuals from adopting something that would benefit them collectively\u2014that occurs when a single company tries to push, and benefit from, a new standard.  The third reason is that hype I mentioned. The current excitement around cryptocurrency gives blockchain the visibility to attract developers and encourage adoption. Companies that have taken an \u201cIf it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it\u201d attitude toward back-office processes and logistics IT might be ready to spend big on updating those systems when they hear the buzzword \u201cblockchain.\u201d  In this way, blockchain resembles another buzzword, \u201cthe cloud.\u201d While detractors argued that the cloud was just \u201csomeone else\u2019s computer,\u201d it gave many industries new business processes, new ways to charge for services, disruptive startups and new divisions within existing companies and an ecosystem of supporting technologies. Blockchain has the same potential.  Blockchain All the Things  Take logistics. Already, 1.1 million items sold or on sale at Walmart are on a blockchain\u2014including chicken and almond milk\u2014helping the company trace their journey from manufacturer to store shelf. Global shipping giant Maersk uses the same technology from IBM to track shipping containers, making it faster and easier to transfer them and get them through customs.  While these projects are still a fraction of the overall tracking that goes on at these giants, they are expanding rapidly both within the organizations and across their industries. Other companies using blockchain technology to track goods include Kroger, Nestl\u00e9, Tyson Foods and Unilever, with many more yet to be announced, says Bridget van Kralingen, senior vice president of platforms and blockchain at IBM.  Everledger, a company started in April 2014 with the intention of creating a blockchain-based registry of every certified diamond in the world, already has 2.2 million diamonds in its registry. It\u2019s adding about 100,000 diamonds a month, says Leanne Kemp, chief executive and founder.

Dubai, for example, has declared its intent to make itself the \u201cfirst blockchain-powered government in the world by 2020.\u201d That could streamline things in real estate, says Stephen McKeon, an associate professor of finance at the University of Oregon who studies blockchain. By moving the central record of all real-estate transactions onto a blockchain, Dubai could make it faster and easier to transfer property titles.  Because such \u201csmart contracts\u201d on a blockchain are code, they can contain rules about how they can be modified or transferred. In this way, blockchain could become a way to transfer the obligation of enforcement from bureaucrats to computers. For example, to prevent fraud, titles could be transferable only to certain accounts, or might transfer only after another condition, such as the transfer of funds in escrow, is met.

The most justifiable skepticism is that blockchain is incremental rather than revolutionary. In some cases, it isn\u2019t much more than a marketing term imposed on systems that hardly differ from existing databases. (There\u2019s a healthy debate about what blockchain even means, and even companies like CartaSense call their system a \u201cblockchain-like technology.\u201d)  But if it works, it has the potential to be a fundamental enabling technology, the way new standards for transmitting data across networks led to the internet. More concretely, it could someday underlie everything from how we vote to who we connect with online to what we buy.
