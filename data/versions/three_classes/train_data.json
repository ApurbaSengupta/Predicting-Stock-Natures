You know the refrain: They're just copycats of U.S. counterparts, ripping off larger rivals and protected by trade barriers such as censorship and investment laws.  Frankly, this is an intellectual crutch.  Witness the overuse of descriptive cliches -- X, the Netflix of China; Y, the Amazon.com of China; Z, the blah, blah of China. It's as if observers just can't give credit where credit is due.  Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. shouldn't be known as anything but the Alibaba of China. Same goes for Tencent Holdings Ltd.

Pick Up the Pace Alibaba is growing much faster than Amazon.com Source: Bloomberg  There's not much either company has copied from an overseas counterpart. Both don't have any fundamental technology that's crucial to their business, let alone something they stole from offshore.  What they do have is innovation, flexibility and the ability to develop new products at great speed whenever they spot a market opportunity. That's why they've become China's biggest companies by market value, at $532 billion for Tencent and $465 billion for Alibaba.  The pair's business models are also incredibly different. Alibaba gets most of its money from advertising, not e-commerce, whereas Tencent's WeChat has only just started tapping the ad market.  Alipay and WeChat Pay are good examples of how they stand out. No Western company has achieved even a sliver of what these products have managed. Mobile payments are ubiquitous in China in a way that makes the U.S. look like it's stuck in the Stone Age.  More Connected The U.S. and China have similar levels of internet access, yet the Chinese are much more engaged on mobile Source: 2018 Global Digital report by WeAreSocial and Hootsuite  Alibaba's was born out of an online sales platform that is itself ubiquitous. Equate Jack Ma's empire to that of Amazon if you like, but first tell me about Amazon Pay. Tencent's version, meanwhile, came from WeChat, the most powerful communications tool in China. No company worldwide has come close to the depth and breadth of WeChat usage.  Exhibit A: WhatsApp. Bought by Facebook Inc. for $19 billion four years ago, Mark Zuckerberg has barely done anything with it. Don't blame Chinese censorship and protectionism for the fact that you can't book and pay for a doctor's appointment over WhatsApp.  Similar can be said not only for Alibaba but its affiliate Ant Financial, which has become a vehicle for money market investments, bill payments and loans. It's only recently there have been reports from the Wall Street Journal about Amazon considering offering checking accounts.  On hardware, people often accuse Chinese brands Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo and others of copying Apple Inc. That was once a valid observation. Xiaomi's business model is unique, though, and it has since gone on to develop its own designs based on technology developed and sold by U.S. companies.  It's also made a significant mark in India, which no Western smartphone company has managed. To complain that Chinese hardware vendors have the benefit of cheaper labor is a non-starter. Nokia Oyj and Motorola Solutions Inc. had access to the same factories (run by Foxconn) before they went belly up, while Apple still thrives.

There's a reason Alibaba is buying an equity stake, but it's not that.  A mega IPO from the world's largest fintech unicorn? Don't bet on it.  Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. said Thursday it plans to acquire 33 percent of its affiliate Ant Financial in exchange for certain intellectual property rights. When the deal closes, the companies will end the profit-sharing arrangement by which Ant pays royalty and other fees equaling 37.5 percent of its pretax profit to Alibaba.  The news sparked speculation Alibaba may be planning to take Ant public. The owner of Alipay was last valued at $60 billion, making it the world's second-most-valuable startup after Uber Technologies Inc.  Not So Tiny Ant Financial is the world's second-largest unicorn after Uber, valued at $60 billion Source: Crunchbase  But a look at Ant's earnings doesn't make the case that it's ready for a share sale. In the quarter through Dec. 31, Alibaba received a payment of 193 million yuan ($31 million) from Ant, down from 2 billion yuan in the September period. That's a 90 percent drop. Alibaba said that subsidy payments to acquire new Alipay users were behind the decline.  Squashed Ant Financial's profit contribution to Alibaba tumbled in the December quarter Source: Alibaba company filings  The nagging question is why Alibaba is doing this now, when it's had the option to buy into Ant since 2014.  Ant's business is facing some challenges. My guess is Alibaba management can see this is a company that can't afford to be paying out 37.5 percent of pretax income in the form of a dividend. In taking an equity stake, it's lending a helping hand.  As I wrote in December, Ant must navigate an increasingly complex web of rules covering everything from micro loans to the billions of dollars of client money it holds in escrow. Regulators in China tend to leave flourishing sectors like fintech alone, until they don't -- then out comes the wooden paddle.  Until recently, micro lending was very lucrative. Ant's two micro-lending subsidiaries have over the past year packaged up thousands of consumer loans and sold them to institutional investors in the form of asset-backed securities. As a result, in the first nine months of 2017, one of the units, Jiebei, generated 5.3 billion yuan of operating profit on just 3.8 billion yuan of capital. According to Bernstein Research, consumer lending accounts for almost 20 percent of Ant's income.  Empire Building Ant's revenue streams span payments to consumer lending to insurance distribution Source: Bernstein Research  The milk in that cash cow turned sour in December, when Beijing said Ant couldn't issue ABS exceeding 2.3 times its total capital. Now, to grow its micro-lending business, Ant needs to inject cash. In mid-December, Ant raised Jiebei's registered capital to 12 billion yuan.  Other areas of Ant's empire are under pressure. Because of Alibaba's dominance in e-commerce, Ant holds billions of dollars of client money in escrow, on which it can earn substantial interest income. But 12 months ago, the People's Bank of China ruled that all third-party payment platforms must deposit 20 percent of those funds in non-interest-earning reserves at designated banks. That threshold may be raised to 50 percent this year. This easy money used to comprise about 17 percent of Ant's revenue.  Don't think I'm all down on this deal, however.  Were Ant to IPO, investors in Asia, and possibly beyond, would have a chance to buy into China's dominant mobile-payments provider. And while middle-class consumers may not want the cheap stuff on Alibaba's Taobao, no doubt we'll all be using Alipay one day for everything from train tickets in Hong Kong to taxis in Singapore and clothes shopping in Osaka.  U.S. investors have been advocating for years for an Ant IPO to unlock the so-called conglomerate discount. What they need is patience. Ant's financials may not be looking so rosy now but this is a company with huge potential. It could one day become even bigger than Alibaba itself. Now that would be a share sale worth waiting for.

The online bazaar now spends more on marketing than technology.  For all the talk of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. being a massive online bazaar, the Chinese behemoth once spent large sums of money on its technology.

Investors poring over the latest financials will salivate at the company raising its full-year revenue forecast, or finally swapping its profit-sharing agreement with Ant Financial for an actual equity stake. They're both important headline items, but they paper over a deeper change in Alibaba's strategy that could have a longer-term impact.

But marketing executives don't build AI, and ad spend doesn't produce technological breakthroughs -- in fact, it's often the other way around.  Alibaba is already China's king of e-commerce, yet there are plenty of Davids ready to slay this Goliath in both existing and new industry categories.

It has also made investments in traditional retailers, including department store chain Intime Retail Group Co. and China\u2019s largest operator of Walmart-style hypermarkets.  \"If the Ele.me distribution network is integrated with Cainiao it can become a more efficient asset and bring it to break-even quicker,\" said Kirk Boodry, an analyst with New Street Research.

The deal won\u2019t be reflected in the Tokyo-based company\u2019s debt, which may help shield it from a ratings downgrade, and could help its plans to sell shares in a domestic subsidiary, the people said.  The participation of the world\u2019s biggest banks in the trade reflects their continued appetite for complex share-based trades linked to their most-prized clients even after banks lost more than $1 billion combined on a margin loan linked to Steinhoff International Holdings NV. The South African retailer has lost more than 90 percent of its market value following disclosures of accounting errors that dated back several years.  \u201cTo my knowledge, I would agree that $8 billion is the largest margin loan ever,\u201d said Bethany Knight, a former Deutsche Bank executive who now advises on equity derivatives at Riverside Risk Advisors LLC in New York. \u201cThere are only a handful of sizable margin loans due to the significant ownership stake needed in a large, liquid, public company.\u201d  SoftBank couldn\u2019t immediately be reached for comment. Shares in Alibaba fell 2.2 percent to $168.86 at 12.25 p.m. in New York.  BNP Paribas SA, Deutsche Bank AG, Nomura Holdings Inc., Societe Generale SA, UBS Group AG and ING Groep NV were among other lenders on the deal, the people said. Representatives for the banks either declined to comment or didn\u2019t return calls and emails.  The margin loan\u2019s interest rate is the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, plus about 150 basis points, or 1.5 percent, two of the people said. Softbank sold $2 billion of 10-year bonds last year that had a yield of 5.7 percent in London.  The margin loan may also remove an obstacle to the initial public offering of its domestic telecommunications unit SoftBank Corp., which had been used as collateral for its earlier debt, one of the people said. A successful IPO -- possible only after the division proves its independence by canceling debt guarantees -- could help the parent raise capital and relieve some of its debt burden, which reached 15.8 trillion yen ($147 billion) at the end of last year. A Tokyo listing could raise more than 2 trillion yen, people with knowledge of the matter said this year.  Masayoshi Son Photographer: Akio Kon/Bloomberg  Billionaire founder Masayoshi Son, who has said he aims for a listing within a year, is seeking to separate SoftBank\u2019s activities into investing and telecommunications arms as it branches out into businesses ranging from ride-hailing to insurance.  SoftBank Group\u2019s debt risk last month jumped to the highest in almost two years following a successful exchange of its dollar- and euro-denominated bonds for new securities, allowing the mobile-phone unit to release its loan guarantee. That swap eases the way for the IPO, prompting concern among bondholders that the unit\u2019s listing may reduce the amount of cash flow for the parent company.  In a margin loan, a borrower secures the debt by pledging an asset with the understanding that they\u2019d need to pay up if the value of the collateral declines. The lender can typically sell some of the collateral if the borrower is unable to provide the cash. Banks compete for these deals because of the fees associated with structured financing.", "stock": "BABA"}, {"url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-20/alibaba-is-said-to-mull-buying-rocket-internet-s-pakistan-unit", "label": -1, "source": "bloomberg", "date": "2018-03-20", "article": "Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is considering acquiring Rocket Internet\u2019s online retail unit in Pakistan to help China\u2019s biggest e-commerce company expand its reach in the South Asian nation, a person with knowledge of the matter said.

To be the first to know, please click here.  Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba upgraded the AI platform powering its Tmall Genie X1 smart speaker to include visual recognition capabilities, according to Ciol.  The AI platform, dubbed AliGenie 2.0, offers visual recognition capabilities via \"Genie FireEye,\" a new function in the Tmall Genie's mobile app. Consumers can attach their phones to a phone holder, called the \"Xholder,\" that's connected to the smart speaker, and then use their phone camera to scan items, which the device will recognize. It will then read aloud information associated with those items.  A robust AI platform with visual recognition capabilities could help Alibaba continue to grow its share of the global smart speaker market. Alibaba released the Tmall Genie X1 exclusively for the Chinese market in July 2017. It then captured 2.6% of the global smart speaker market in Q4 2017, making it the third-largest smart speaker vendor after Amazon and Google in terms of shipments, according to Strategy Analytics. The smart speaker is also the top-selling voice-controlled smart speaker in China, with 2 million units shipped since its release, and it's been connected to over 45 million smart home devices.  Bringing visual recognition to the Tmall Genie X1 is key to Alibaba's approach to the market. Alibaba is looking into retail, travel, and especially hospitality as areas for smart speaker growth, while its competitors are primarily focused on securing a place in the home for their smart speakers. With the new visual function, the Tmall Genie X1 will be able to scan and read over 40,000 medicine boxes, which could be crucial for individuals with visual impairments.  The device will also be capable of scanning book covers, and can currently read aloud over 117 books by Chinese publishers. Additionally, the Tmall Genie X1 will be able to interact with consumers through more than 20 simulated animations and facial expressions, allowing its users to enjoy an immersive experience that includes voice, visual, and touch interaction. Alibaba reportedly plans to implement facial recognition capabilities in a separate rollout to make the speaker even more engaging.  The addition of visual recognition to smart speakers marks the next logical step for vendors looking to expand use cases. The creation of new and immersive experiences with the addition of visual functions presents new avenues for businesses to interact with consumers, and will likely boost user engagement as a result. Visual interactive elements can also help businesses leveraging smart speakers to find new monetization structures, like visual-based advertisements and app subscriptions that are based on higher quality and more interactive experiences.", "stock": "BABA"}, {"url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/alibaba-stock-price-wants-to-dominate-food-delivery-in-china-2018-2", "label": -1, "source": "business-insider", "date": "2018-02-27", "article": "Ruben Sprich/Reuters  There's speculation that Alibaba is looking to buy out the remaining stake of Ele.me, its food delivery unit.

The talks were reportedly not CEO level, and they're not guaranteed to lead to any type of cooperation, but a potential partnership could hold a lot of value for both parties.  For Kroger, a partnership with Alibaba may help it revolutionize its e-commerce and in-store experiences. Alibaba has a number of technologies that would benefit Kroger if the partnership comes to fruition. And Kroger may have an interest in such innovations, as it recently embarked on its Restock Kroger initiative to improve its digital and omnichannel capabilities.  Alibaba has expertise in e-commerce, which means that it can both advise Kroger as it looks to revamp its digital offerings, and provide some of its algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI) to help Kroger better personalize its online shopping experience.  Brick-and-mortar has been a focus for Alibaba recently, and it's developed some in-store innovations that would be valuable to Kroger. Technology including in-store AI for recommendations, in-store data analytics, automated grocery delivery help, and more could all help Kroger's in-store operations and improve its performance.  Working with Kroger could give Alibaba the ability to sell more American goods or gain data on the US market. If the potential partnership results in Kroger selling products through Alibaba's marketplace in China, Alibaba would be offering more US goods to Chinese consumers, who are very interested in them, likely bringing in new sales. But if a deal sees Alibaba working with Kroger in the US-based retailer's stores, Alibaba would be able to collect data on US consumers, a market it's shown an interest in.  Regardless of whether they ink a deal, this meeting displays Alibaba's interest in expanding its relationship with US retailers and potentially entering the market.Previously, Alibaba has been building its relationships with US merchants, and even hosted a conference in Detroit to launch an initiative to help them sell to Chinese consumers. Meeting with Kroger may mean that Alibaba is looking to bring more retailers to its marketplace to get more cross-border sales, or it could be building up its partners to make an entrance into the US market. Working with Kroger would be a significant step in both directions.  Jonathan Camhi, research analyst for BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has laid out the case for why retailers must transition to an omnichannel fulfillment model, and the challenges complicating that transition for most companies. This omnichannel fulfillment report also detail the benefits and difficulties involved with specific omnichannel fulfillment services like click-and-collect, ship-to-store, and ship-from-store, providing examples of retailers that have experienced success and struggles with these methods. Lastly, it walks through the steps retailers need to take to optimize omnichannel fulfillment for lower costs and faster delivery times.  Here are some of the key takeaways from the report:  Brick-and-mortar retailers must cut delivery times and costs to meet online shoppers' expectations of free and fast shipping.  Omnichannel fulfillment services can help retailers achieve that goal while also keeping their stores relevant.  However, few retailers have mastered these services, which has led to increasing shipping costs eating into their profit margins.  In order to optimize costs and realize the full benefits of these omnichannel services, retailers must undertake costly and time-consuming transformations of their logistics, inventory, and store systems and operations.  In full, the report:  Details the benefits of omnichannel services like click-and-collect and ship-from-store, including lowering delivery times and costs, and driving in-store traffic and sales.  Provides examples of the successes and struggles various retailers have experienced with omnichannel delivery.  Explains why retailers are having trouble managing costs with their omnichannel fulfillment efforts, which are eating into their profits.

The company's domestic and international growth efforts came at a heavy price:  Alibaba, Tencent, and JD.com spent billions to carve up China. In an effort to counter rival Alibaba as it forces physical retailers to give up partnerships with its competitors, JD.com and Tencent, JD.com's largest shareholder, embarked on a spending spree throughout 2017.

Marketing costs to compete on Singles' Day are rising.JD.com's marketing expenses grew to 4.7 billion yuan ($0.7 billion) in the fourth quarter, up 35% YoY. A major factor behind those rising costs was marketing for Singles' Day 2017, which paid off in the form of $19.1 billion in transaction volume for JD.com, more than 50% higher than a year earlier. The leading beneficiary of Singles' Day is Alibaba, which generated $25.3 billion in revenue on that day.  International growth plans are key to JD.com's success in 2018. Outside of China, JD.com's war against Alibaba is fiercest in Southeast Asia. The region is critical because it will see its internet economy grow to $200 billion by 2025, according to Google estimates cited by TechCrunch. In 2017, JD.com's investments in Southeast Asia expanded beyond its beachhead in Indonesia, for example, through large investments in e-commerce companies in Thailand and Vietnam. A key factor behind JD.com's overall success in 2018 will be whether the firm can grow its volume in Southeast Asia against mounting competitive pressure form Alibaba and others.", "stock": "BABA"}, {"url": "http://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/alibaba-stock-price-reaping-rewards-skyrocketing-china-online-sales-2018-3-1018765242", "label": -1, "source": "business-insider", "date": "2018-03-15", "article": "Thomson Reuters  Shares of Alibaba are up more than 3% Thursday thanks to strong sales data from the Chinese government.

Gideon Mendel/Corbis via Getty Images  Taobao, the Alibaba-backed online retailer, has launched a customized version of its app for elderly users.  China has 255 million people aged over 60, a largely untapped market potentially worth billions in revenue.  The company recently began recruiting for two elderly workers to improve its app for older users.  Nestle, IBM, and Apple have all begun targeting older consumers in China and Japan.  While most companies are still figuring out how to capture the millennial market, Taobao, the Alibaba-backed online retailer, has its focus set on China's growing population of senior citizens.  Last week the company launched an \"elderly-friendly\" version of its app that the company hopes will capture the attention of aging Chinese. There are currently 222 million people aged over 60 in China and, by 2020, that number is expected to hit 255 million\u2014 almost 20% of the country's population.  To gain access to this growing consumer base,Taobao's customized app is designed to be easier for older shoppers to use and can link straight to their children's account who have the \"pay-for-me\" option if they are inclined to cover their parents' purchase costs.  The customized app also displays a photo of their child on every page so users can easily share products or start a conversation via phone or text. Italso has a larger, less crowded interface, and uses more shortcuts for navigation.  \"By launching this simple and user-friendly option for the Taobao App, we will make online shopping easier for our senior citizens and help them stay connected with the younger generation and the community,\" said Ding Jian, Senior Product Manager at Taobao, who heads the development of this new channel, said in a statement emailed to Business Insider.  It's a sound financial move by Alibaba.  Last year, according to Taobao, shoppers over age 50 in China bought, on average, 44 products spending nearly $800 shopping online. Accounting for just senior citizens over 60 puts a possible total spend at around $200 billion a year.  Currently, Taobao has just 6 million users aged 60 to 69.Last month it began recruiting for two employees aged 60 or over who will work to get feedback from elderly users to improve the customized app.  But the company isn't alone in trying to tap the \"silver economy.\"  After Nestle previously launched a milk line for Chinese drinkers over age 50 and in Japan, where senior citizens account for more than a quarter of the population, Apple and IBM developed a modified iPad for the elderly which also had larger text, simpler interfaces and a modified FaceTime to easily speak to family.", "stock": "BABA"}, {"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/04/01/alibaba-to-buy-all-remaining-outstanding-shares-of-local-delivery-service-ele-me/", "label": -1, "source": "techcrunch", "date": "2018-04-02", "article": "As expected since February, Alibaba will buy all outstanding shares of Ele.me that it doesn\u2019t already own.

Nexar\u2019s dashcam app relies on computer vision and sensor fusion to detect accidents and analyze road conditions, then sends real-time alerts to other vehicles on its network. Its tech is also used by insurance companies for collision reconstructions to help with claim investigations.  The Tel Aviv-based company also made two big leadership announcements. Yoad Shraybom, the former chief financial officer of the Walt Disney Company in Turkey, Israel and Greece, is now its CFO, and Incapsula founder and former general manager Marc Gaffan will serve as its chief business officer. Though Nexar\u2019s newly-minted CFO and CBO positions might prompt speculation that it is eyeing a stock offering (Mobileye, another road safety tech company, went public in 2014), co-founder and CEO Eran Shir said there are no current plans for an IPO. Instead, the addition of Shraybom and Gaffan is meant to help the company\u2019s global expansion. Ibex partner Elan Zivotofsky also joined its board.  Nexar has now raised $45 million in total funding and is using its new capital to build its vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) network by signing partnerships with insurance companies, drivers on ride-sharing services like Uber or Lyft, automakers and municipalities that use its tech to monitor traffic and street infrastructure. For cities, Nexar\u2019s tools helps them find ways to fix traffic bottlenecks or spot potholes, cracks and other potentially dangerous road damage by creating a \u201cdigital MRI of the city,\u201d said Shir in an email.  Nexar\u2019s app launched in 2016 and is now used by drivers in 740 cities across 160 countries, the company claims. Its biggest markets are currently New York City (Nexar says its used by more than 10% of ride-sharing drivers there), San Francisco, Tel Aviv and Las Vegas. The addition of Alibaba as an investor may help Nexar add some Chinese cities to that list, too.  \u201cChina is an incredibly exciting market for us which we always have our eye on.

Bloomberg reported yesterday that Alibaba plans to purchase the roughly-60 percent of Ele.me that it currently doesn\u2019t own from the other investors, which include search giant Baidu. TechCrunch has confirmed that with sources close to Alibaba, who told us that a proposal to buy the remaining stakes was submitted to investors yesterday.  Alibaba first invested in Ele.me in 2016 and it doubled down to lead a $1 billion investment last year. Ele.me consolidated its position as one of China\u2019s largest food on-demand platforms when it picked up Baidu\u2019s rival business back in August, which explains how Baidu became an investor.  The acquisition could value Ele.me at as much a $9.5 billion, according to Bloomberg, and the deal would be significant since it would once again pit Alibaba against its key rival Tencent.  While Alibaba\u2019s core business is e-commerce and Tencent\u2019s is online content and messaging, the two have overlapped into a myriad of verticals, each time coming up against each other either through startups they have invested in or independent business unit they own.  Tencent tends to favor the investment approach while Alibaba has bought businesses outright \u2014 including Weibo, Youku Tudou and UC Web.  In the food delivery case, Tencent\u2019s horse is Meituan Dianping, the local services business formed when China\u2019s two largest on-demand platforms came together via a 2015 merger. To add additional complication to that, Alibaba and Tencent briefly both held stakes in the merged entity since Alibaba backed Meituan and Tencent previously put money into Dianping. Alibaba moved to sell its share of Meituan Dianping in early 2017, leaving it free to double down on Ele.me as it did last year.  Assuming Alibaba is successful with its latest offer, Ele.me will form part of its \u2018new retail\u2019 push that\u2019s designed to combine the best of e-commerce with offline retail. The company has bought expensive stakes in physical retail stores and opened its own hybrid retail locations.

Cloud revenue was $553 million, an impressive 104 percent year-over-year increase. That comes out to a run rate in the range of $2.2 billion, well behind Google which announced it is pulling in a billion dollars a quarter and still buried behind the market leaders all of whom reported around $4 billion+ a quarter.  While the growth was impressive, keep in mind when you have a small market share, it\u2019s much easier to grow a big number than when you have a larger market share. In other words, it gets harder to grow, the larger you get.  It is worth noting, however that the growth spurt allowed Alibaba to show up in the top five of Synergy Research\u2019s most recent Cloud Infrastructure Market Share report for the first time. While the market share was only around 3 or 4 percent. it\u2019s still significant because no longer being lumped together with \u201cnext 10\u201d or \u201crest of market.\u201d  Synergy reports that the cloud market grew 46 percent in the fourth quarter, and each of the biggest cloud companies benefited over the smaller ones. \u201cIn large part the expansion was driven by aggressive growth of Amazon (AWS), Microsoft, Google and Alibaba, who all increased their share of the worldwide market at the expense of smaller cloud providers,\u201d Synergy wrote in their report.  The fact that smaller players continue to struggle in the cloud market isn\u2019t that surprising, but it makes Alibaba\u2019s rapid rise all the more remarkable. That Alibaba has shown up at all is a testimony to how fast it has grown. Even though Alibaba launched its cloud business in 2009, just a few years after AWS, the company really only began taking it seriously as a business in 2015 with a billion dollar investment. That didn\u2019t seem like enough at the time, but it has taken some big leaps to get to this point so quickly.  While the majority of its business is in China and Asia more broadly, that is a huge market and gives Alibaba enough lift to grow fast and move up in the market more quickly. In another report from Synergy published last year, it found to no one\u2019s surprise that the Chinese cloud market was dominated by Chinese cloud companies. Alibaba was at the top of the cloud services market tier, which wasn\u2019t the most lucrative, but was the fastest growing.  For Alibaba to really expand its share and move up the graph, it probably needs to build a bigger market in the west, particularly in the US. It currently runs 14 data centers worldwide with just two in the US, one in Silicon Valley and one in Virginia. It is expanding rapidly with plans to build several new data centers in China, Malaysia, India and Indonesia.  For Alibaba, the explosive growth numbers are positive news, but it still remains far behind market leader AWS and other big players like Microsoft, IBM and Google. Whether it can sustain that level of growth over the long term remains an open question, but for the short term it surely has been impressive.", "stock": "BABA"}, {"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/04/03/softbank-leads-450m-investment-in-paytms-e-commerce-business/", "label": -1, "source": "techcrunch", "date": "2018-04-03", "article": "SoftBank is at it again giving money to companies that rival startups it has already invested in.

Beijing Easyhome operates 223 physical home furnishing and DIY-style stores across 29 provinces in China, which it claims makes it the country\u2019s second largest in its field.  The second outlay is for a 38 percent stake in Shiji Retail Information Technology, Reuters reports, which works with hotels and high-street retailers on data-related services to increase customer footfall, grow engagement and more.  The Beijing Easyhome deal is the fourth major investment that the e-commerce giant has made in a brick and mortar chain.

Other participants in the round, which consists of equity and debt financing, included Ant Financial (Alibaba Group\u2019s financial affiliate), Haofeng Group, Tianhe Capital and Junli Capital. Alibaba Group also led Ofo\u2019s $700 million Series E round last year, which was announced one month after Mobike disclosed that it had received a $600 million Series E led by Tencent.

Even two years ago, the potential was evident, with Lee explaining that teaching, medicine and healthcare were obvious areas for disruption.

China\u2019s tech giants like Alibaba and Tencent are some of the most valuable in the world, and upcoming potential IPOs by the next generation of startups like Xiaomi are causes for celebration. Most Chinese citizens would be thrilled, however, there is a deep irony behind their success. These Chinese tech companies can actually not be purchased on a Chinese stock exchange, nor can Chinese retail investors buy a share in them.  Chinese workers build these companies up, and the value accretes to American capitalists (\u201cSocialism with Chinese Characteristics,\u201d I guess?)  Now, the central government is proposing new rules that would allow these companies to come back to the mainland through the use of Chinese Depositary Receipts, or CDRs. That\u2019s big news, and could completely transform not only the market caps of some of the largest tech companies in the world, but also increase competition between trading houses like the New York Stock Exchange and Chinese stock exchanges in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Shenzhen.  WTF is a CDR then? Before we get to that, we first need to understand why they are needed in the first place.  Domestic buyers buying domestic stocks is really, really hard in China  In economics theory, stock exchanges are epitomized as a shining exemplar of the notions of free trade and efficient markets. Each company is selling a standard unit (a share), prices are transparently disclosed and buyers and sellers can connect in a central market (an exchange) to buy and sell their securities at voluntary prices.  In reality of course, governments strongly regulate financial securities to ensure that those exchanges are well-ordered. The Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States is just one of several public and private bodies that regulate the conduct and operation of the nation\u2019s exchanges.  Now up that regulation by 100x when you enter China. Listing on a stock exchange must be approved by the central government, and regulators have been aggressive in blocking listings over the past few years. Due to robust capital controls, Chinese citizens may only buy local securities, and can\u2019t invest in companies outside of China through foreign stock exchanges. Likewise, foreign investors face daunting challenges in investing in local companies, even with liberalization programs over the last two decades. The government regularly intervenes in the operation of the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges through trade freezes and other machinations. Local securities regulations can be highly burdensome, and force companies to engage in \u201cparty building\u201d activities.  For Chinese companies looking to raise capital from private investors, there are two paths forward. One is to offer multiple types of shares traded in different places. Classically, this has meant an \u201cA-share\u201d that was traded in say Shanghai and only available for purchase by locals, and a \u201cB-share\u201d that was only available to foreigners. Some companies chose to have an \u201cH-share,\u201d which was listed in Hong Kong, which has none of the securities regulations of domestic Chinese exchanges. These different classes of shares are priced independently, and there can be wide discrepancies between them (A-shares have traditionally had massive premiums compared to other share types, and researchers still don\u2019t know exactly why).  This path is convoluted, so large Chinese companies \u2014 including Alibaba and Tencent \u2014 are often incorporated in places like the Cayman Islands to avoid domestic securities requirements, while also giving them access to foreign capital markets. According to an analysis by offshore incorporation specialist law firm Walkers, nearly half of all Hong Kong-listed stocks are based in the Cayman Islands, with another quarter based in Bermuda. That is financially prudent for executives, but deeply unpopular with Chinese authorities, which both loses corporate control and also loses the future growth that these stocks attain when they list on a foreign exchange.  WTF is a CDR?  That\u2019s where Chinese Depositary Receipts (CDRs) come in. Modeled after American Depositary Receipts, which were invented almost a century ago, CDRs are a way for local buyers to own foreign shares in a way that both fits within local securities regulations and reduces friction in the trading process.  A bank acts as a middleman broker between a foreign issuer and local buyers. This institution, known as the depositary, holds foreign shares of companies in trust, and then offers a new security to the local market linked to those deposited shares by a ratio (say one receipt per six shares). We now have two securities: the receipt, held by a shareholder which is connected to a depositary bank, and the original foreign share, which is held by the bank on behalf of a foreign issuer.  This is where the \u201cmagic\u201d happens: Securities regulations apply to the new security targeting local buyers, and not to the shares of the original company (massive asterisk here since the reality is thousands of pages of policies and laws, but this is the general idea). By intermediating the transaction, everyone can win: Local buyers get access to foreign investments, while also still coming under the purview of domestic regulations.  It\u2019s important to note that there are a bunch of peculiarities that I don\u2019t want to dive too much into. There are more fees than standard shares in order to pay for custody of the shares and the trading logistics to maintain them. There are tax implications and other accounting issues that can be quite complex depending on the investor.  Despite such complications though, depositary receipts are quite popular in the United States. The market in 2016 was worth an estimated $2.9 trillion, with roughly 3,500 such securities available to be traded, and dozens more launched that year, according to BNY Mellon, which is among the largest depositary bank institutions in the country. Given that the Chinese economy is already larger than America\u2019s today by some economic measures, the scale of a CDR market could well pass a trillion dollars.  Share the wealth at home  The concept behind depositary receipts may not be new, but their use in China has not previously been formalized, and that is liable to change now. This past Friday, the central government circulated a draft policy of new securities regulations that would allow for Chinese Depositary Receipts to be issued on local stock exchanges.  According to China Banking News, tech companies look like the major focus here. \u201cThe Opinions will allow some tech companies or enterprises in strategic emerging industries to perform listing via the issuance of either shares or depository receipts, with a focus on sectors including big data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, software, integrated circuits, high-end manufacturing and bio-tech.\u201d That focus on technology would match other initiatives of the Chinese Communist Party, namely the country\u2019s roadmap for technological dominance, known as Made in China 2025.  Once the CDR mechanism is in place, Chinese companies listed overseas are expected to face significant pressure to utilize it and open up their ownership to local buyers. Already, companies like Baidu, Sogou, Alibaba, Tencent and Xiaomi have said publicly that they are interested in finding a channel to return to the mainland (or in the case of Xiaomi, to potentially launch its initial offering at least partially there). As Bloomberg wrote a month ago, \u201cEnticing mega-corporations to list locally will help burnish the reputation of China\u2019s twin bourses in Shanghai and Shenzhen, notorious for spotty regulation, volatility and periodic government intervention.\u201d  Furthermore, having more domestic Chinese shareholders ensures that corporate control of these local companies stays in Chinese hands. The Chinese Communist Party has been particularly aggressive on this front, proposing taking a point of equity in top firms and potentially installing party cadres on corporate boards. Changing the shareholder structure of these firms then should be seen as an extension of control by the party into the private sector.  While the changes are still being promulgated, we should be prepared for large changes in the ways that companies \u2014 particularly those in the technology sector \u2014 are capitalized. Alibaba and Tencent\u2019s combined market cap is nearly a trillion dollars. There are dozens of other Chinese stocks listed exclusively in U.S. and Western exchanges, so if CDRs become popular, it could be a massive market.

In particular, it hopes to gather more detailed user data, which could help it offer more personalized services and ads to its customers online and off.  In that respect, the company has a head start on Amazon, which paid more than $13 billion for Whole Foods last year. In 2015, Alibaba struck a deal to buy a stake in Suning, an electronics retailer. It took control of Intime Retail, which runs department stores and malls, early last year. In November, it bought a $2.9 billion slice of Sun Art, one of China\u2019s largest grocery operators.

It also runs WeChat, China\u2019s most popular messaging and social media app.  But Tencent is also charging into the old-fashioned shopping business. In December, it bought a stake in Yonghui Superstores, a large supermarket chain. It is weighing an investment in the China operations of Carrefour, the grocer and retailer headquartered in France. It is also leading the purchase of a $5.4 billion stake in Dalian Wanda Commercial Properties, a mall operator and part of the troubled Dalian Wanda conglomerate.

Tencent primarily seems to want to create more opportunities for people to use its mobile payment service, WeChat Pay. It is also hunting for new clients for its cloud computing business.  \u201cIt\u2019s very hard for me to imagine that Tencent would fully own and operate a supermarket on its own,\u201d Mr. Shi of Nomura said.  For both Alibaba and Tencent, though, creating more points of contact with their customers helps them amass more user data. This is one reason the companies are investing heavily in artificial intelligence, which helps them make sense of the boatloads of user information they are hauling in every minute.  \u201cThey not only have the largest data sets, but they have data sets tied to customers that they can identify,\u201d Kirk Boodry, an analyst with New Street Research, said. \u201cThe potential for A.I.-led monetization growth, we think, is still at a very early stage.\u201d  Also on Thursday, Alibaba said it would acquire a one-third stake in the parent company of Alipay, one of China\u2019s two main online payment services.

As businesses and governments around the world look for ways to skirt the traditional news media, The Post has become a test case for how a new owner can co-opt an established brand to promote certain viewpoints. Alibaba executives say they want to present a \u201cfair and balanced\u201d alternative to foreign media, a mission statement that echoes Fox News.  Gary Liu, a Harvard-educated technology entrepreneur who is The Post\u2019s chief executive, said the newspaper could offer a more nuanced portrait of China than Western news outlets, with a staff of 350 journalists in Asia, including about 40 in the mainland.  \u201cWe are not here, certainly, to promote the views and wishes of Beijing,\u201d said Mr. Liu, who was previously chief executive of Digg, a news aggregation site in New York.  Photo  But a culture of self-censorship at the newspaper predates its purchase by Alibaba, said Wang Feng, who served as The Post\u2019s online editor from 2012 to 2015. He said top editors routinely rewrote, played down or withheld critical stories for fear of offending influential Chinese officials or business executives.

Last year, The Post retracted a business column that suggested an investor in Hong Kong had ties to a trusted adviser to President Xi Jinping and had used his connections to amass wealth. The editors said the column made \u201cinsinuations beyond the facts.\u201d  Its author, Shirley Yam, a well-respected financial commentator, resigned. In a statement, Ms. Yam defended her column, saying that editors had vetted the piece extensively before its publication.  Some critics said the more notable change under Alibaba may be The Post\u2019s ramped-up production of articles that present China in a friendly light.  Photo  In February, Post journalists said, the Ministry of Public Security pushed the paper\u2019s top editors to send a reporter to interview Gui Minhai, a political critic and Swedish citizen whom the Chinese police had snatched from a train.  Mr. Gui was then quoted saying he had broken Chinese law and did not want help from the outside world. In its coverage, The Post said that the interview with Mr. Gui was \u201cgovernment-arranged.\u201d  \u201cThe Post risks being a vehicle in Beijing\u2019s overall propaganda machinery,\u201d said Willy Wo-Lap Lam, a scholar at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and a former Post journalist.

Mr. Xi, China\u2019s most powerful leader in decades, has all but eliminated critical reporting in the mainland, placed new pressure on Hong Kong media and ordered a vast expansion of China\u2019s publicity machine, with state broadcasters merged into a single entity called the \u201cVoice of China\u201d to strengthen China\u2019s international messaging.

The Post\u2019s leaders say that Alibaba executives, who have offices a few floors above the newsroom, are not involved in editorial decisions. But Mr. Tsai, the co-founder who spoke at the celebration last month, maintains a close connection, offering occasional feedback on coverage and new products.  There has been at least one noticeable change since the sale: an outpouring of coverage of Alibaba and its leader, Jack Ma, one of China\u2019s richest men. Articles mentioning Alibaba reached an average of about 3.5 per day last year online and in print, roughly double the number in 2016, according to an archival search.  Alibaba appears to be willing to lose money on The Post, which is not profitable, according to newsroom leaders. Mr. Tsai has said The Post, with a circulation of about 101,000 and more than 10 million monthly active users on its website, may not become a self-sustaining business for at least five more years.  Traffic to The Post\u2019s website has roughly tripled over the past year, the company said. Alibaba made access free when it took over.  But Alibaba has abandoned ambitions of expanding the audience for The Post\u2019s journalism in the mainland, where its website is blocked. Even with its pro-China mission, articles in The Post still touch on topics that are off limits to mainland readers, like the 1989 Tiananmen massacre.  Photo  While many of its approximately 850 articles a week appear tailored for a Hong Kong or Asian audience, The Post has gone on a hiring spree of journalists from outlets like the BBC and The New York Times to help bring an international tone to its coverage.

That\u2019s up to three years in the slammer,\u201d read one recent headline on an Inkstone article about penalties for mocking the Chinese national anthem in Hong Kong.

Now Mr. Delaney, a former China correspondent for Bloomberg News, makes a point of clarifying.  \u201cWithin the first minute, I just want to let them know, \u2018Just so you know, we\u2019re not a mainland Chinese newspaper, even though we have China in our name,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThat gets kind of awkward.\u201d", "stock": "BABA"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/31/technology/amazon-china-health-care-ai.html", "label": -1, "source": "the-new-york-times", "date": "2018-01-31", "article": "Alibaba and Tencent, which already dominate China\u2019s e-commerce and mobile payments sectors, are at the forefront. Among their goals: building diagnostic tools that will make doctors more efficient.  Amazon and its partners, JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway, see technology as a way to provide simplified, affordable medical services. Although the alliance is still in the early stages, it could create online services for medical advice or use its overall heft to negotiate for lower drug prices.  \u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that across the board, the Chinese tech companies have all embraced being involved in and being active in the health care space, unlike the U.S., where some of them have and some have not,\u201d said Laura Nelson Carney, an Asia-Pacific health care analyst at Bernstein Research.  Photo  \u201cFew of them have made moves as big as in China,\u201d Ms. Carney said, referring to Alibaba and Tencent\u2019s American rivals.  Those big moves have had varying degrees of success.  In 2014, Alibaba announced a \u201cfuture hospital\u201d plan intended to make treatment more efficient by allowing patients to consult with doctors online and order drugs via the internet. But two years later, Chinese regulators stopped the sale of over-the-counter drugs on Tmall, Alibaba\u2019s e-commerce website. They also suspended a drug-monitoring system that the company had created. And last year, the search engine company Baidu scrapped its internet health care service, which allowed patients to book doctors appointments through an app, in a bid to focus solely on A.I.  But some of the more recent initiatives have made inroads. Last year, Alibaba\u2019s health unit introduced A.I. software that can help interpret CT scans and an A.I. medical lab to help doctors make diagnoses. About a month later, Tencent unveiled Miying, a medical imaging program that helps doctors detect early signs of cancer, in the southwestern region of Guangxi. It is now used in nearly 100 hospitals across China.  Tencent has also invested in WeDoctor Group, which has opened its own take on Alibaba\u2019s \u201cfuture hospital\u201d in northwestern China. The service allows patients to video chat with doctors and fill their prescriptions online.

Dr. Yu Weihong, an ophthalmologist at Peking Union Medical College Hospital, said she used to take up to two days to analyze a patient\u2019s eyes by scrutinizing grainy images before discussing her findings with colleagues and writing up a report.

The software has been developed by VoxelCloud, a start-up has raised about $28.5 million from companies including Tencent and the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Sequoia Capital. It specializes in automated medical image analysis, helping eye doctors like Dr. Yu screen patients for diabetic retinopathy, the leading cause of blindness among China\u2019s working-age population.  There are just 20 eye doctors for every million people here, a third of the proportion in the United States. In April, Beijing announced an ambitious plan for the country\u2019s 110 million diabetics to undergo eye tests.  \u201cIt\u2019s impossible for one person to read that many images,\u201d said Dr. Yu.  Ding Xiaowei, whose grandparents were doctors, founded VoxelCloud in 2016, three months after completing his doctorate in computer science at U.C.L.A. The company, which has offices in Los Angeles and the Chinese cities of Shanghai and Suzhou, is awaiting the green light from China\u2019s version of the F.D.A. for five diagnostic tools for CT scans and retina disease.  Photo  The sheer size of China\u2019s population \u2014 nearly 1.4 billion people who could provide a vast number of images to feed into their systems \u2014 provides a potential advantage for the development of artificial intelligence. Also helping: China has fewer concerns about privacy, allowing for easier collection of data that could result in smarter and more efficient A.I. systems. Regulation here isn\u2019t as strict as in the United States, either.  In all, more than 130 companies are applying A.I. in ways that could increase the efficiency of China\u2019s health care system, according to Yiou Intelligence, an industry consultancy based in Beijing. They range from behemoths like Alibaba and Tencent to domestic champions iFlyTek, which invented a robot that passed a Chinese medical licensing exam, and an array of smaller start-ups.  Money is flowing in. As of last August, venture capitalists such as Sequoia and Matrix Partners had invested at least $2.7 billion in such businesses, according to Yiou. Analysts at Bernstein estimated that spending in China\u2019s health tech industry will reach $150 billion by 2020.  Behind this push is a realization that the country\u2019s health care system is in crisis. With no functioning primary care system, patients flock to hospitals in major cities, sometimes camping out overnight just to get treatment for a fever. Doctors are overworked, and reports of stabbings and assaults by frustrated patients and their relatives are not uncommon.

Yitu is working with Zhejiang Provincial People\u2019s Hospital, the best medical facility in eastern Zhejiang province, to develop software that automates the identification of early stages of lung cancer.  While it initially focused on facial recognition, Yitu has branched out into more complex image-recognition challenges, like cancer scans. Lin Chenxi, who left Alibaba to establish the company in 2012, said he hoped to use the technology to ensure equal access to medical treatment across China.  \u201cIn China, medical resources are very scarce and unequally distributed so that the top resources are concentrated in provincial capitals,\u201d he said. \u201cWith this system, if it can be used at hospitals in rural cities, then it will make the medical experience much better.\u201d  Trying to identify cancer nodes \u2014 shifting black-and-white splotches that look something like a Rorschach test \u2014 is grueling work, and China\u2019s doctors have far less time and resources than their counterparts in the United States and elsewhere.

So far, those concerns have been largely theoretical \u2014 inflation has mostly stayed below the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2 percent target.

A scary U.S. inflation print in February sent shares sliding and raised fears of four, rather than three, interest rate rises in 2018. Since then though, inflation has failed to spook markets the same way; worries about trade and Big Tech regulation have instead come to the fore. Next week, with U.S. CPI data due, markets may find themselves back thinking about price rises and wondering if those February fears were justified.  There is no sign yet of those fears resurfacing. Latest jobs data showed the United States created the fewest jobs in six months, even if higher wage gains signalled tight labour markets. Bond markets' inflation expectations gauge -- 10-year inflation breakeven rates -- extended a recent drop.  CPI next week is expected to be up 0.2 percent, the same as its as-consensus rise in February. That could soothe volatile stocks -- if earnings hold up and trade tensions abate.

Next week's March trade data from China will probably show the economy extending its impressive run-up in exports: it's too early to see any impact from the tit-for-tat tariff salvos the Trump administration and Beijing have been firing off in recent days. China's Feb exports rose 44.5 percent versus year-ago levels -- well above the forecast 13.6 percent gain -- and another strong print may evoke fresh ire from Trump.  Global stocks have been volatile but on the whole, seem to believe all this is just noise. Discerning equity investors with shares in Chinese tech giants Baidu, Tencent or Alibaba also know the Sino-U.S. trade balance vastly overstates China's direct stake in those exports, which include components from Taiwan, Korea and elsewhere in Asia. Which means that U.S. tariffs on Chinese telecoms and electronics are negative for Asia as a whole.  In a worst-case scenario, trade wars may affect Japanese markets more than China if they boost the safe-haven yen and depress the Nikkei.

January's current account deficit was $7.096 billion, worse than forecast, highlighting how dependent Turkey is on foreign capital. Higher interest rates could help fix that by luring overseas flows and reducing inflation, which is in the double digits. But there are fears President Tayyip Erdogan -- a self-declared \"enemy\" of interest rates -- is escalating his campaign for lower borrowing costs.  The lira has already fallen 6 percent to the dollar this year and a bigger current account gap than expected could tip it lower still. The central bank has little firepower to support it.

Richardson, who has taken a less active role in league proceedings in recent years, has not attended the meetings here.

Soon after Sports Illustrated published a report detailing those allegations, Richardson, 82, said he would sell the team.  Certain N.F.L. owners have already started to make their preferences known. Many owners have said that, all bids being equal, they prefer Tepper because he already owns a stake in the Steelers, which he would have to sell if he bought the Panthers, and because he has the financial wherewithal, with a net worth of roughly $11 billion.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Rubin, who teamed up on his bid with Joe Tsai, the co-founder of the Alibaba Group, is also known to N.F.L. owners because Fanatics is the official retail partner of team merchandise.  While both Tepper and Rubin appear willing to continue bidding for the team, neither are prepared to pay $2.5 billion, according to several people with knowledge of the auction, though they could be posturing.  Representatives for Tepper, Rubin, Kestenbaum and Navarro all declined to comment.  At the meetings here, three owners who declined to be identified because they did not want to be seen injecting themselves into the process, said that Navarro\u2019s holdings in companies that lend to subprime borrowers might be a stumbling block for them.  Navarro\u2019s company, Sherman Financial Group, has stakes in financial services companies around the world, but 90 percent of the revenue and income comes from Credit One Bank, which issues credit cards to credit-challenged customers. Credit One has been sued for using aggressive collection techniques.  Among other things, Sherman Financial also buys and manages consumer debt. Sherman Financial also paid a $175,000 penalty to settle a case brought by New York attorney general Eric Scheiderman for unlawful debt collection.  Additionally, Sherman Financial also owns about half of a joint venture with the Chedraui family in Mexico that provides similar lending services. The company, Consupago, offers loans that are among the most expensive in Mexico to a captive market of government employees.  On Sunday, Bob McNair, the owner of the Houston Texans, voiced support for Navarro. He cited his philanthropic giving and said he had no issue with his line of work. \u201cHis business is a legitimate business,\u201d McNair told reporters. \u201cFor me, that wouldn\u2019t be a problem.\u201d", "stock": "BABA"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/20/opinion/xi-jinping-china-west.html", "label": -1, "source": "the-new-york-times", "date": "2018-03-20", "article": "However, over the past five years, the pace of reform has slowed, in large part because the party has feared losing control. The 13th National People\u2019s Congress has promised to accelerate the reform program once more, with a renewed commitment to put \u201cthe market\u201d at the center of the economy. We will see.  Perhaps the greatest analytical error across the West has been the view that Xi Jinping would want to continue to sustain the liberal, international rules-based order once its economic power began to rival that of the United States. Again, this hope goes against the well-known facts: China has long said that it sees the existing order as one invented by the victors of the last world war, one in which China did not have a seat at the table.  China has never shared the West\u2019s view of human rights. It has long sought to weaken the powers of the United Nations Human Rights Commission. China has at best had an ambivalent attitude to free trade \u2014 just look at its qualified support for the World Trade Organization, its opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership and its own long history of mercantilism.  And as for the global security order, China has never changed its hostility to the global system of American military alliances, in particular those in the Asia Pacific, which it has long attacked as legacies of the Cold War. That\u2019s in addition to China\u2019s assertion of its territorial claims in the South China Sea.  For these reasons, Mr. Xi has explicitly called for \u201ca new type of great power relations,\u201d \u201ca new type of international system\u201d emerging out of the \u201ccurrent struggle for the international order\u201d and a new type of activist Chinese diplomacy that puts to bed Deng Xiaoping\u2019s dictum of \u201chide your strength, bide your time, and never take the lead.\u201d Hence its efforts to foster an alternative multilateral system with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Belt and Road Initiative.  Over time Mr. Xi would like to turn the page on the liberal Western order and write a new chapter in world history. If China in the next decade becomes the largest economy in the world with Mr. Xi still likely its leader, the country\u2019s economic success would be based on a form of state capitalism that rejects the notion that rising income parallels broader economic liberalization and political democracy.  None of us knows how much Mr. Xi will seek to apply the principles of this \u201cChina model\u201d to the wider international order. There will be tensions here. But we should be very clear about what Mr. Xi wants for China itself, rather than seeing it through the rose-colored glasses of the West, still shaped by the images of Deng Xiaoping\u2019s China, a quarter of a century ago.

It's not there yet, but it has real potential to one day be the smart home command center Google wants it to be.  It\u2019s hard finding a good roommate. Some leave dishes in the sink. Others stiff you on rent. But Google, or more specifically, the Google Assistant, isn\u2019t like that at all. Everything considered and as far as roommates go, it\u2019s actually one of the best you\u2019ll ever have.  (Update: Google Home can now make calls to landlines in the UK! This was a feature unveiled at last year's Google IO, and has now finally made its way into the home.)  That\u2019s because Google Assistant, the smart artificial intelligence that\u2019s built into the Google Home, actually makes life easier rather than more difficult for you. You can ask it to lower the thermostat for you when you leave, diagnose your symptoms when you\u2019re feeling ill or have it locate that funny clip from Colbert last night and throw it onto your Chromecast without any hesitation.  It\u2019s smart enough to tell you how much plane tickets cost from where you live to any exotic destination you can think of, or prattle off oddly specific information like how much a Macaw weighs (2.6 to 3.3 pounds, apparently) or how much a new piece of technology costs (\u201cAccording to TechRadar, the PlayStation 4 Pro costs $399 or \u00a3349\u201d).  But, ask that very same question using different words or in a slightly different tone, and Google\u2019s ultra-smart assistant suddenly forgets what it just told you.  That general problem \u2013 \u201dit works sometimes but not all the time\u201d \u2013 isn\u2019t just symptomatic of the $129 (\u00a3129/AU$199) Google Home; the Amazon Echo, the current smart home incumbent, is far from immune to them as well. In due time, both devices will get smarter, but as it stands both are more novelty than pragmatic purchases.  Google Home is far from perfect at the moment, but it\u2019s sure to get better over time as Google continues to work on its voice assistant technology, and we\u2019ll be updating our review regularly as new functionality continues to be added.  What's new for Google Home in 2017?  Google might not have shown up with new Home hardware to Google IO 2017, but its latest software update will make the six-month-old Google Home feel like a new machine. To that end, Google announced four major changes coming to the smart speaker in 2017: proactive assistance, hands-free calling, Bluetooth and visual responses. Read on for additional details.  Let\u2019s start off by covering the two biggest announcements first: hands-free calling and Bluetooth. The way calling is going to work when Google rolls out the feature later this year is that you\u2019ll import contacts from your phone and then, when you want to make a phone call, all you\u2019ll need to do is ask.  The Home will make the call from either a private phone number or, if you have your Google account tied to your cell phone, using your own number. From the sounds of it, all you need is an active internet connection to make the calls \u2013 that means you won\u2019t need a landline or even a cell phone to make calls at home.  Another big update, Home will now be able to use Bluetooth to sync up to other devices \u2013 a feature the Home\u2019s competitor, Amazon Echo, has had since it launched and had so far been strangely absent on Google\u2019s smart speaker.  In addition to the Bluetooth announcement, Google announced that the Home will support the free version of Spotify, SoundCloud and Deezer in addition to the music streaming services it already supported later this summer.  The other two announcements \u2013 proactive assistance and visual responses \u2013while neat, aren\u2019t going to radically change how you use Home.  Visual responses, a new feature on Google Home that leverages Google Assistant to send visual information to either your phone, tablet or TV, definitely feels like a swing at the Amazon Echo Show. However, while Amazon\u2019s device comes with a built-in screen to show you events on your calendar or what the weather outside looks like, voice requests on the Home go through Assistant which spits the results onto any Chromecast, Android TV and TVs.  Speaking of the Assistant, Google has recently added a useful new assistance function to its smart assistant that brings it in line with Amazon's Alexa: voice reminders. It's now possible for English speaking Google Home owners in the UK, US, Canada and Australia to set one-off or recurring reminders using their voice, even months in advance of events.  Any reminders you set using your Google Home device will also appear on your Android device as long as it's running software from Android M on. Even if your Google Home has more than one user, you'll only ever hear reminders for you.  Design  Now, because \u201cair freshener\u201d can be a varied description depending on where you are in the world, a more apt description of its shape might be a small vase \u2013 it has a wide bottom and a tapered top. Each Google Home comes with a standard, gray fabric base with a rubber bottom that can be swapped out for a different material or color for around $20 (\u00a318/AU$29).  So far, Google offers two types of bases to match your home decor: metallic and fabric, each with different colors and finishes. Metallic bases are made out of either painted steel or polycarbonate and come in copper, snow or carbon colors. On the fabric side, the three colors are mango, marine and violet, in addition to the standard white mesh listed above.  Pick up a new base for your Google Home on the Google Play Store  From a pure aesthetic point of view, Google Home is the far more attractive option when compared to the Amazon Echo\u2019s all-black canister shape. It\u2019s less ominous than the black monolith and it\u2019s also a fair bit shorter at 5.62 x 3.79 inches (142.8 x 96.4mm; H x D), which means it\u2019s easier for the Home to blend into its surroundings.  There\u2019s also some function to this form, however. The top, flat, inclined surface of the Google Home acts as a touch-capacitive panel, allowing you to change the volume, play and pause the music or activate the Google Home assistant with a tap. Once activated either by pressing the top panel for a couple of seconds or saying the wake word (\u201cOK Google\u201d or \u201cHey Google\u201d), four multi-colored lights twist and whirl to indicate that you\u2019ve caught its attention.  While Amazon\u2019s Echo has a physical control to change its volume, Google Home\u2019s touch controls feel less precise. We do however appreciate the inclusion of a physical button to mute the speaker, which means you can be sure when it is, and is not, listening.  Google Home generally does an ok job of picking up your voice with its two built-in microphones located on the top half of the chassis, but it doesn\u2019t work 100% of the time. Whether this is down to Google\u2019s software, or its reliance on two microphones rather than the Amazon Echo\u2019s five, it means you\u2019ll definitely end up repeating yourself or raising your voice to get its attention more.  Uncap the bottom base and you\u2019ll find a speaker and two passive radiators, which, considering the sheer volume the little device can put out, is impressive. The Amazon Echo has a few more speakers inside its chassis, and can therefore sound a bit better at higher volumes, however what\u2019s under the hood here is enough to get the job done.  Audio performance  While Google Assistant, the voice and smarts inside the speaker, might be the main attraction here, Google Home is actually a pretty capable audio device as well.  It can access all sorts of streaming services \u2013 Google Play Music, YouTube Music, Spotify and Pandora \u2013 and works as a Wi-Fi speaker thanks to its built-in Google Cast capabilities.  What that means in practice is that you\u2019ll be able to ask it to play nearly any song you can think of, and it will either find it on Google Play Music\u2019s 30-million-plus catalogue or, if you\u2019ve taken it up on its free trial offer, pull it up YouTube Music. Think about that for a second. Unlimited access to music on YouTube? Yeah, by far and away, Google Home probably has the largest song library of any audio device on the market.  We tried for an hour to find a song that Google Home couldn\u2019t pull up \u2013 recalling some seriously obscure music, like the theme song from 1998\u2019s Banjo-Kazooie game on N64 to the title track for Requiem for a Dream \u2013 to no avail. Of course, you\u2019ll likely stumble across something that Google Home can\u2019t find, but the fact that we couldn\u2019t stump it after arming ourselves with dozens of songs is absolutely unheard of.  Less impressive is how much difficulty the Google Home had with recognising band names that sound similar to one another. Try as we might, we couldn\u2019t get the speaker to play any music by the band \u2018Brontide\u2019. Sometimes it would claim that their music wasn\u2019t available (it\u2019s on Spotify), or else it would play music or playlists from completely unrelated artists.  It\u2019s also too bad the expansive library of songs is stuck \u2013 for the most part \u2013 inside a less-than-amazing-sounding speaker.  Compared to Bluetooth speakers in its price range like, say, the Creative Sound Blaster Roar 2 or Razer Leviathan Mini, music on the Google Home comes off as less robust with little separation and little punch in the low-end or clarity in the mids and highs.  Now, it\u2019s not completely incapable for playing decent-sounding music \u2013 it does have some bass and some mids \u2013 but, if you\u2019re expecting Google Home to replace your Hi-Fi setup, you\u2019ll be severely disappointed. (Audiophiles, keep in mind that a vast majority of the time Google Home sources its music from YouTube, a site infamous for its audio compression.)  But Google Home makes up for its less-than-pristine audio quality with a feature that other speakers don\u2019t have, and that\u2019s its ability to both receive and send Google Cast signals, making it the only audio device that can not only stream music from your phone, but send video streams to any Google Cast-compatible connected devices as well.  Google Cast and Chromecast performance  One of our smaller frustrations with the Amazon Echo Dot, Amazon\u2019s smart speaker that\u2019s designed to be plugged into an existing audio setup, was that there was no way to control which speaker was used as its output using voice commands.  In theory, Google Home doesn\u2019t have this issue. Simply set up a Chromecast with a name that\u2019s easy to pronounce, and you can tell your Google Home to cast your favourite songs or even videos to your Hi-Fi and TV respectively.  At launch in both the UK and Australia, it supported a number of local streaming services. For example, in the UK we were able to play BBC Radio 4 on the speaker directly, which it was intelligent enough to automatically stream from iPlayer, and it was also capable of streaming from Channel 4\u2019s All 4 streaming app.  In theory it\u2019s a great streaming solution, but in practice we had trouble with the functionality.  Take as an example the phrase, \u201cWatch Rick and Morty from Netflix on Jon\u2019s Projector.\u201d If your pronunciation is perfect then the command will work most of the time, but if the speaker fails to hear any part of the instruction then it will fail completely.  Then there\u2019s the issue of selecting specific episodes, which Google Home is unable to do. Ask it to play a show and it will start from where you last left off, but you can\u2019t ask it to play a specific episode. Skipping between episodes, meanwhile, works well.  We\u2019d love it if the speaker was intelligent enough to remember part of the command and ask for clarification on the parts that it didn\u2019t understand, but as it stands you have to get the whole command right in one go.  It\u2019s also a pain to control playback once you\u2019ve started casting. Instructing the speaker to \u2018play\u2019 or \u2018pause\u2019 works well, but if you tell it to play another song then it suddenly forgets that it\u2019s casting and will instead play the new song from the Home\u2019s own speaker.  The big promise with Google Assistant was that it would be contextually aware, but from our experience it has a long way to go. You\u2019ll find yourself repeating a lot of information that the Home should be able to work out itself.  Google Home as the center of your smart home  Of course, Chromecast isn\u2019t the only device that Google Home can talk to. There are a half-dozen devices that can hook into Google Home right now, or will be able to do so soon. (We\u2019ve compiled a list of the best Google Home smart home devices so you don\u2019t have to waste time tracking each one down.)  The highlights of what Google Home can connect to right now are Nest thermostats, Philips Hue lightbulbs and Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform, while support for even more third-party devices like LIFX lightbulbs and LG MusicFlow speakers should be coming soon.  Google Home will also integrate with thermostats from Netatmo and Tado.  Although you\u2019ll frequently need to sign into these third-party products, once you\u2019re in the functionality works well. We tested the Google Home with a Nest setup and found that its commands were easy and intuitive to give.  Recently, Google announced that Home would support several new smart home ecosystems including products from August, Wink, LIFX, TP-Link, Rachio, Vivent, First Alert, Frigidaire, Logitech, Geeni, Anova and US-retailer Best Buy\u2019s Insignia brand. Together, these should give you far more options for which devices you can string together and give you more control of your burgeoning smart home.  While further hardware integration is nice, one of the largest problem Google Home faces is that it can\u2019t integrate with many of Google\u2019s own services \u2013 like Gmail, Voice and Docs \u2013 which have been its bread and butter for years.  Take Gmail, for instance. You\u2019d think Google Home might be able to rattle off the subjects of your top 10 emails \u2013 but, surprise, it can\u2019t. The same goes for Google Calendar where it\u2019s unable to create new events (although it will happily read out existing events in your calendar), make phone calls with Google Voice or jot down some quick notes in a Google Doc. Google has a dozen services that the Home should be able to link into and yet, in its current state, simply cannot. Not only is this a big disappointment, but it makes us wonder why this functionality wasn't given more of a priority.  And while it\u2019s easy to hammer this point home and point out all Google Home\u2019s shortcomings in one long-winded tirade, we\u2019re not going to. That\u2019s not because we\u2019re avoiding the harsh criticism or defending the Home, we\u2019re not.  But we\u2019ve already fallen into that trap of being overly critical of a smart platform once before with Amazon Echo, and since then it has flourished into an amazingly smart, connected platform that can answer hundreds more questions than it could two short years ago. It can order pizza or restock the refrigerator or call an Uber or check what time a restaurant closes, and the list of everything it can do grows week over week.  Google Home can do some of that already, making it far and away a better system now than the Echo was when it first launched. Some of that it can\u2019t. But, speaking from experience, it\u2019s only going to get better, smarter and more robust in the coming weeks, months and years.  It\u2019s just not there yet.  We liked  One thing\u2019s for sure: You might never appreciate just how much music is on YouTube without buying a Google Home. While some of the biggest music streaming services in the world boast libraries of 25, 30 and even 40 million songs, they\u2019re far from complete. We\u2019re not saying Google Home is capable of playing any song you can think of, but after dredging the depths of the \u201990s we still couldn\u2019t find a tune Google Home couldn\u2019t find.  And while Google Home excels as a DJ, it\u2019s also a surprisingly intelligent smart home hub. It already hooks into some of the largest platforms now by including Nest, Philips and Samsung\u2019s SmartThings, and given a few months that number will grow even more.  Its Google Cast functionality is excellent, and has real potential.  We disliked  Clearly the lack of integration into Google\u2019s own services is a huge issue. The fact that it can\u2019t shoot an email to someone in your contacts or help you schedule events through Google Calendar are massive oversights that vastly reduce how useful the Home could be.  The other problem with Google Assistant is how precise you have to be when asking your questions. Asking what year a song was written might not turn up any results, while asking what year a song was released might unveil the exact answer you were looking for. Follow up any inquiry with a simple request like \u201cOK Google, tell me more about it\u201d and it suddenly forgets what you\u2019ve been talking about for the past 30 seconds.  A lack of contextual awareness is also a massive problem for its Google Cast functionality right now. Be prepared to reiterate where you want your music to play from a lot when using Google Home.  Admittedly, this lack of contextual awareness isn\u2019t something that Alexa deals with \u2013 which is surprising considering that the Echo doesn\u2019t come from the company with 20-plus years of search engine experience.  Final verdict  It\u2019s easy to feel disappointed with Google Home when you buy one and expect it to be the coveted center of the smart home Google has marketed it as. It\u2019s just not there yet. It\u2019s a bit too rigid in its language comprehension, its list of smart home devices is growing but still a bit underwhelming, and, perhaps the biggest disappointment of all, it doesn\u2019t have many of Google\u2019s core services built into it.  The best comparison for Google Home, obviously, is the Amazon Echo. They both have identical functions, fetch music from similar sources and are stumped, largely, by the same set of questions. While the Echo is still the more formidable of the two thanks to the dozens of developers who have created bespoke commands, the Home is \u2013 at worst \u2013 about six months behind in development.  There\u2019s also the issue that although the Home is more ambitious with its media playback, it hasn\u2019t worked out a way for you to access this functionality in a way that\u2019s simple enough to be done with your voice. There\u2019s little point in having all that functionality when it\u2019s a chore to use.  Given the same attention from hardware and software developers and some of those additional Google services, the Home could quickly grow from a nascent smart speaker with Chromecast integration to the first and most critical piece of the ever-expanding smart home.  For now, the Google Home is simply a smart novelty with access to YouTube Music, built-in Google Cast and the ability to save you a trip to the light switch.", "stock": "BABA"}, {"url": "http://www.techradar.com/news/the-beloved-nokia-3310-is-back-with-4g-lte-and-android", "label": -1, "source": "techradar", "date": "2018-01-31", "article": "One of the bombshell announcements of MWC 2017 was the revamped Nokia 3310. Following up on the buzz at MWC 2018 will be tough for manufacturer HMD Global, but it will give it a try with a 4G-enabled version of the phone called the Nokia 3310 4G.  Unlike the top-secret Samsung Galaxy S9, the 3310 4G has actually already been announced in China, but isn\u2019t confirmed for arrival elsewhere \u2013 these are the sort of details we look forward to being revealed at MWC.  Even so, the device is in the open and as such, we know a lot about it. The 4G-friendly 3310 will look the same as last year\u2019s model, but the software inside is reportedly improved over a Java-based platform to an Android-based operating system made by Chinese retail giant Alibaba \u2013 though that could change if it makes it to the US, UK or AU regions.

Since the phone doesn\u2019t appear to have changed, the same can presumably be said about its battery life. Based on projections, 4G looks to take a heavy toll on the 3310, bringing the lifespan down to about five hours of talk time compared to the 2G version\u2019s 15-hour target.  Global availability of the Nokia 3310 4G is unconfirmed, as is its price, but we expect at least a $20-30 premium for the feature compared to the 3G version, which sits at $59 in the US, \u00a359.99 in the UK and AU$89.95 in Australia.  If it shows up at MWC at the end of February, Nokia\u2019s nostalgia trip of a phone might not capture hearts and minds that it did last year, but a 4G-enhanced classic will certainly appeal to good amount of people.

At the time, Reliance Jio was preparing to launch the JioPhone in India, something many thought would be a \u201crevolution\u201d.  However, the Nokia 3310 turned out to be a phone that tried to monetise nostalgia. It was a 2G phone in a 4G world, and reviewers like me were quick to dismiss it.  Admittedly, we don\u2019t have statistics on how much this phone actually sold. Yet, it\u2019s fair to say that the Nokia 3310 (2017) was a failed product, at least from a critics point of view. In this case, mine. But HMD Global is now said to be working on a 4G version of the product, apparently tying up with Reliance Jio for the same. Have they finally come to their senses?  But, do we need it now?  A year hence, the JioPhone is among us, as are a plethora of other 4G feature phones or low-cost 4G smartphones. As with Nokia\u2019s entire smartphone line, the Nokia 3310 is also late to the party.  Admittedly, the JioPhone has been out of stock for the better part of its life cycle, while there\u2019s no word on how many Micromax Bharat phones have been sold. But we do have many options already in the 4G feature phones and low-cost  In 2017, a 4G Nokia 3310 would have been the perfect mix of nostalgia and usefulness. It would have been the damage-proof feature phone with modern aesthetics and connectivity. It can still be that, but no one\u2019s really asking that question anymore. Instead, the questions HMD Global will be faced with are,  Does this have WhatsApp?  Can I browse Facebook?  And so on\u2026.  And the answers to all those questions will be no. The Nokia 3310 (2017) doesn\u2019t support WhatsApp, and there\u2019s no reason to think this new one will either. But herein lies a twist.  Will the Nokia 3310 support WhatsApp?  YunOS  Last year\u2019s phone ran Nokia\u2019s Series 30+ OS, a seriously hamstrung software for 2017. But this new one runs on YunOS, a fork of Android made by Chinese giant Alibaba. I\u2019ve had the good fortune to interact with YunOS in my many trips to China, and I have to admit it\u2019s impressive software. YunOS is on televisions, phones, and even home cleaning robots. While Series 30+ lacks app support of any real sign of modernism, YunOS is at the forefront of today\u2019s software, at least from a feature phone point of view.  But then, YunOS has never been seen outside China either. Would this be the phone that finally gets Alibaba\u2019s software across borders? Unlikely, but it could mean HMD Global will run a forked version of Android (much like Micromax\u2019s Bharat 1) here in India. And it would make all the sense, if the company wants to take advantage of 4G connectivity. If not, it\u2019s just a handy Internet dongle that costs you three-odd thousand bucks.  With Android at its core, the Nokia 3310 could actually be a \u201cpremium\u201d 4G feature phone, something this market truly lacks. A huge chunk of the Indian market still uses feature phones, and for that market, the Nokia 3310 could suddenly become a sign of affluence. \u201cFeature phones remain the dominant category in the total mobile phone market, with annual shipments of 136.1 million units. The category declined by only 9.4 percent in CY2016 as compared to 16.2 percent in CY2015,\u201d said a report by the International Data Corporation, in February last year.  4G connectivity is not enough  Essentially, if Nokia, or HMD Global, is to sell a 4G Nokia 3310 in India, it has to be running Android. If not, it\u2019s really the feature phone equivalent of the OnePlus 5 and 5T. It\u2019s an upgrade for the sake of an upgrade. At the very least, HMD Global will have to add support for apps like WhatsApp and vastly improve the apps it does have. Given that Series 30+ isn\u2019t capable of much more, it\u2019s unlikely that that will happen. For a company that sells smartphones on the \u201cPure, secure and always up to date\u201d, it shouldn\u2019t take much to realise the importance of Android here.", "stock": "BABA"}, {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/654d1ed0-f6ce-11e7-88f7-5465a6ce1a00", "label": -1, "source": "financial-times", "date": "2018-03-28", "article": "Experimental feature Listen to this article Play audio for this article Pause 00:00 00:00 Experimental feature Report a mispronounced word What was mispronounced?

Not surprisingly, the region has a tenuous relationship with Beijing, which is more than 1,400 miles away. Protests, riots and even terrorist attacks have been connected to the Uyghur struggle, which gives cover to Chinese authorities to implement the harshest strategies there.  \"Abuses are most apparent in Xinjiang because of the lack of privacy protections but also because the power imbalance between the people there and the police is the greatest in China,\" said Maya Wang, China researcher at Human Rights Watch.  \"The power imbalance between the people there and the police is the greatest in China.\"  That is why security investment in Xinjiang skyrocketed after the riots. According to Adrian Zenz, a lecturer at the European School of Culture and Theology who has written extensively about the police presence in Xinjiang and Tibet, the region's security forces doubled between 2009 and 2011 to more than 11,000 people. And it kept growing: In 2017, he documented more than 65,000 public job advertisements for security-related positions in Xinjiang, and last year Amnesty International estimated that there were 90,000 security staff in the region, the highest ratio of people to security in any province in China.  Several new tools and tactics accompanied this rise in security personnel, most notably the implementation of \"convenience police stations,\" a dense network of street corner, village or neighborhood police stations designed to keep an eye out everywhere and rapidly respond to any threat, perceived or real. But there were also corresponding investments in security technology on a globally unprecedented scale. It started with a drive to put up security cameras in the aftermath of the 2009 riots before evolving into something far more sophisticated, as Xinjiang turned into a place for state-connected companies to test all of their surveillance innovations.  \"The rule of law doesn't exist,\" said William Nee, China researcher at Amnesty International. \"They are able to pioneer new methods of control that, if successful, they could use elsewhere in China.\"  Today, Xinjiang has both a massive security presence and ubiquitous surveillance technology: facial-recognition cameras; iris and body scanners at checkpoints, gas stations and government facilities; the collection of DNA samples for a massive database; mandatory apps that monitor messages and data flow on Uyghurs' smartphones; drones to monitor the borders. While there's some debate over how advanced the system tying these technologies together is, it's clear that China's plan is for a fully integrated system that uses artificial intelligence to rapidly process massive amounts of information for use by the similarly massive numbers of police in convenience stations.  \"[Xinjiang] represents a very new frontier and approach when it comes to online surveillance and oppression.\"  For Uyghurs, it means that wherever they go, whomever they talk to and even whatever they read online are all being monitored by the Chinese government. According to The New York Times, \"When Uighurs buy a kitchen knife, their ID data is etched on the blade as a QR code.\" BuzzFeed documented stories of family members too scared to speak openly to relatives abroad. And the combination of all of these tools through increasingly powerful AI and data processing means absolute control and little freedom.  \"It's one thing to have GPS tracking. It's another thing to monitor social media usage of large populations,\" said Feldstein. \"But to do that in combination with a large DNA database of up to 40 million people and to integrate those methods with other modes of surveillance and intrusion -- that represents a very new frontier and approach when it comes to online surveillance and oppression.\"  The result, at least for China, is a massive success. Violence in the region has fallen as riots, protests and attacks are now rare in Xinjiang. Part of that is due to the presence of the state, but it's also related to a rise in fear, as no one is sure how pervasive the Chinese surveillance apparatus is.  \"People can never be sure if they are free from monitoring,\" said Nicole Morgret, project coordinator at the Uyghur Human Rights Project. \"The fear is such that even if the surveillance is not complete, people behave as if it is. The technology is being rolled out so quickly.\"  That is because access to the actual platforms being used by the Chinese authorities is limited, and much of the knowledge about surveillance technology comes from observations by the few journalists who can report from Xinjiang or through looking at public tender and budget documents. Or, increasingly, the knowledge comes from observing how other regions in China are being monitored and how Chinese tech companies abroad are deploying or marketing similar tools.", "stock": "BABA"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/alibaba-earnings-jump-35-1517488507", "label": -1, "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "date": "2018-02-01", "article": "A sign for Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. at the fourth World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, Zhejiang province, China, Dec. 3, 2017.  A sign for Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. at the fourth World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, Zhejiang province, China, Dec. 3, 2017. Photo: aly song/Reuters  SHANGHAI\u2014Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. said it will acquire a 33% stake in its financial services affiliate Ant Financial Services Group, in a move that could signal that Ant is being readied for a public offering.  The Ant equity purchase was announced as Alibaba reported robust third-quarter earnings of 24.1 billion yuan ($3.82 billion), up from 17.9 billion yuan in the like quarter the previous year. That topped a forecast of 21.6 billion yuan by analysts polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence.  Revenue for the quarter increased 56% from the year-earlier period, to 83.0 billion yuan.  Ant, which was carved out in 2011 during the run-up to Alibaba\u2019s own IPO, runs the fast-growing Alipay mobile payment platform used by Chinese consumers to purchase goods and services, including items on Alibaba\u2019s online shopping sites.  Alibaba said it will acquire the Ant stake as part of a deal approved in 2014. In return, the ecommerce company would transfer intellectual property to Ant, with no cash impact to Alibaba.  The acquisition of the one-third stake in Ant would put Alibaba in a position to benefit if Ant were to go public, which has long been anticipated. Ant Financial was last valued at $60 billion in a 2016 financing round, and the company has grown significantly since then.  Scott Freeze, chief investment officer at Sabretooth Advisors in Pennsylvania, whose fund owns Alibaba stock, said the move suggests Alibaba is preparing its Ant affiliate for a public offering and wants to profit from the company\u2019s mobile payments business as it expands in India, Japan and Korea and other countries.  Alibaba shares were down about 3.8% in recent trade in New York. Mr. Freeze said the sell off was an overreaction to the news, as the stake would give Alibaba access to direct revenue from Ant and more authority over decision-making.  Alibaba\u2019s Chief Financial Officer Maggie Wu declined to comment on IPO speculation.  The companies said that following Alibaba\u2019s stake acquisition, they would terminate their current profit-sharing arrangement which entitles Alibaba to 37.5% of Ant\u2019s pre-tax profit, paid in the form of royalty and technology fees. There would be no cash impact to Alibaba.  Ant paid Alibaba $30 million in such fees in the three months to December, down sharply from amounts in recent quarters because Ant spent heavily to grow its Alipay user base.  Ant paid Alibaba a total of $735 million during the 2017 calendar year, implying that Ant\u2019s pre-tax profit last year was roughly $2 billion.  In a call with investors, Alibaba Vice Chairman Joe Tsai said the Ant stake would allow Alibaba to expand its role of providing value-added services such as mobile payments to upgrade traditional brick and mortar businesses.  The agreement would also give Alibaba more firepower to expand overseas, as payment methods are a key component of online retail, he said.  In its third-quarter report, Alibaba said revenue from its core ecommerce unit\u2014which runs China\u2019s two most popular online retail sites, Taobao and Tmall\u2014remained strong. Sales rose 57% to 73.2 billion yuan.  Alibaba is seeking to expand beyond online commerce into physical retail stores as well, expanding its chain of supermarkets and making a $2.9 billion investment in China\u2019s second-largest big-box retailer Sun Art Retail in the quarter.  Alibaba said its cloud-computing business revenue more than doubled to 3.6 billion yuan, as it attracted more paying customers and introduced more paying services.  Sales from Alibaba\u2019s digital-media and entertainment division, which includes mobile browser UCWeb, video-streaming site Youku Tudou and Alibaba Pictures Group , rose to 5.4 billion yuan. Analysts say intense competition in the digital-entertainment space will weigh on the company going forward, as Alibaba seeks to invest in more content to attract new viewers.  Alibaba\u2019s Youku video-streaming platform attracted about 374 million monthly active users as of Dec 2017, behind Baidu-backed iQiyi and Tencent Video, according to Quest Mobile figures.  \u2014Chuin-Wei Yap contributed to this story  Write to Liza Lin at Liza.Lin@wsj.com", "stock": "BABA"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-alibaba-adds-to-food-delivery-bet-1522662784", "label": -1, "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "date": "2018-04-02", "article": "Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, which with an affiliate currently owns 43% of food-delivery service Ele.me\u2014whose drivers here prepare for a morning shift in Beijing last September\u2014said Monday that it will buy the rest.

The region is home to about 600 million people, and is increasingly attracting the interest of global e-commerce companies eager to get a foothold as more people get internet access and shop online, largely via smartphones.  U.S. e-commerce behemoth Amazon.com Inc. launched its Prime Now fast delivery option in Singapore last July. Chinese online retailer JD.com and Tencent Holdings Ltd -backed Sea Holdings Ltd. also operate e-commerce platforms or have joint ventures in the region.  Southeast Asia\u2019s e-commerce market has grown more than 40% annually since 2015 to reach $10.9 billion in revenue last year, according to a December report co-written by Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and Temasek Holdings. The market is expected to grow to $88.1 billion by 2025, the report forecast.  Alibaba owns about 83% of Lazada. The subsidiary helped Alibaba almost double its international commerce retail revenues to $727 million in the quarter ended Dec. 31, the company said in a statement in February, describing markets in the region as \u201cin the early innings of the game\u201d and pledging to continue investing there.

Wanda is now in business with China\u2019s two largest internet giants as it moves to shore up its balance sheet. The company struck an agreement in late January to sell a 34-billion-yuan stake in its property business, which mainly comprises shopping malls, to a group that included Chinese social-media titan Tencent Holdings Ltd.  Last year, Wanda came under fire from Beijing for its aggressive overseas deal-making, which curtailed the company\u2019s ability to pay for overseas acquisitions and repay debt.

The $522-billion Chinese firm said Thursday that its revenue last quarter grew 56% from a year ago to $12.8 billion\u2014the highest ever. The December quarter always has been big for Alibaba because of Singles\u2019 Day, an annual shopping bonanza in China on Nov. 11.  But part of the increase came from acquisitions as well as its big push into physical retail. This is the first quarter that Alibaba included revenue from Cainiao, its logistics subsidiary, after it increased its stake to 51% in October. It took private department store operator Intime last May. Alibaba also has opened 26 supermarkets, named Hema, in seven cities.  Stripping all those out, revenue would have grown only 41%\u2014still impressive but slower than usual over the past two years. Taking its toll last quarter: China\u2019s crackdown on internet finance and the expulsion of migrant workers in Beijing. Alibaba\u2019s aggressive expansion in physical retail also weighed on margins. Operating profit margin for its e-commerce segment shrank to 48% from 59% from a year earlier.  Alibaba also said it would acquire a 33% stake in Ant Financial, its affiliate that operates China\u2019s largest mobile payment system Alipay. This was expected, according to a 2014 agreement. It will, however, hurt Alibaba as it is receiving 37.5% of Ant\u2019s pretax profits as royalty and technology services fees. But such profit share fell last quarter because of Ant\u2019s aggressive spending to acquire new users. Faced with strong competition from Tencent, profit at Ant may continue to be under pressure.  While Alibaba is still growing fast, much of that has been priced in\u2014the stock trades at 42 times this year\u2019s expected GAAP earnings, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence, after doubling in the past year. As Alibaba pushes aggressively on brick-and-mortar, it may be time for investors to take a pause on the stock.

Spotify Technology SA\u2019s first day of trading wasn\u2019t as volatile as some market observers had feared\u2013although its stock price swung more than other big tech companies that took a conventional approach to going public.  After opening at 12:43 p.m. New York time, shares of Spotify traded as high as $169 and as low as $148.26 before closing at $149.01\u2013a trading range of 13.99%.  That\u2019s slightly wider than Twitter\u2019s trading range on the day of its 2013 initial public offering, when shares in the social-media company traded in a band of 13.84%.  Other big IPOs have seen narrower day-one ranges. The trading range of Snap on its first day was 10.85%, while for Chinese technology giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. it was 10.84%. Snap\u2019s IPO took place last year, while Alibaba\u2019s was in 2014.  Spotify had \u201cfairly low volatility for the first day of trading for a technology IPO,\u201d said Cameron Stanfill, an analyst at PitchBook.  Spotify used an unusual maneuver called a direct listing to go public. The company warned investors that the process could result in greater volatility than a traditional IPO.  In a direct listing, a company simply floats its shares on the stock market. Unlike in a typical IPO, there is no underwriting bank to act as a \u201cstabilizing agent\u201d and prop up the company\u2019s share price if it tumbles out of the gate. There are also no underwriters to market the company\u2019s shares to big investors ahead of the listing, a process called \u201cbook-building\u201d that helps gauge demand in a standard IPO.  \u201cWith a direct listing, you\u2019re coming into the process with less certain supply and demand,\u201d said Joe Mecane, head of execution services at Citadel Securities.  As Spotify\u2019s designated market maker at the New York Stock Exchange, Citadel Securities oversaw the opening of trading in Spotify\u2019s shares, in consultation with one of the company\u2019s financial advisers, Morgan Stanley.  Still, it remains to be seen how Spotify performs over the next few days. One of the other quirks of the direct-listing process is that \u201clock-up\u201d restrictions\u2013which restrict sales of shares by insiders in a normal IPO\u2013are much looser in the case of Spotify. That means shares in the music-streaming company could tumble if many of its existing shareholders decide to sell.", "stock": "BABA"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ant-financials-mysterious-valuation-inflation-1523449320", "label": -1, "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "date": "2018-04-11", "article": "Ant Financial\u2019s mascot on display in an office in Hangzhou, China.

JD -1.97% is spending 34 billion yuan ($5.37 billion) for a 14% stake in Chinese billionaire Wang Jianlin\u2019s commercial-property company as he faces a deadline to relist the business in China.  Wanda, China\u2019s largest mall developer, is benefiting from an escalating war for consumers and data between Tencent and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA -2.21% , the country\u2019s two largest internet companies.  Alibaba has already established several partnerships with department-store and supermarket chains in China, and is seeking to integrate online retail with physical stores.  Tencent has invested in Alibaba\u2019s online shopping rival JD.com, and the deal announced Monday gives both a partner in China\u2019s shopping-mall business as they seek to blunt Alibaba\u2019s move into physical stores. The traditional stores are seen as a way to attract new customers and, for Tencent and Alibaba, as a means to expand their mobile payment platforms.  \u201cThe deal represents one of the world\u2019s largest single strategic investments between internet companies and brick-and-mortar commercial giants,\u201d parent company Dalian Wanda Group and the others said in a joint release. Other investors include electronics retailer Suning Commerce Group and fellow property developer Sunac Holdings Ltd.  This month, Tencent signed a partnership agreement with French retailer Carrefour S.A. and a local supermarket chain, agreeing to take a stake in Carrefour\u2019s Chinese entity. In Shanghai, it also is testing an unmanned pop-up store with consumers using mobile payments to complete the sale.  JD will invest 5 billion yuan into Wanda Commercial Properties Co., the company said in a regulatory filing. JD took part in the deal to create multichannel approaches to shopping, a JD spokesman said.  In announcing the investment, Wanda said the aim was to speed up the adoption of its \u201casset-light\u201d model that would allow it to earn income from managing properties instead of owning them.  Wanda Commercial raised 34.5 billion Hong Kong dollars ($4.34 billion) from private investors to delist the company\u2019s Hong Kong shares in 2016, in the biggest take-private deal on the city\u2019s exchange. Wanda\u2019s aim was to relist the company in China, where big appetite from retail investors helps companies fetch higher valuations.  Last year, Wanda came under fire from Beijing for its aggressive overseas deal-making, which curtailed the company\u2019s ability to pay for overseas acquisitions and repay debt. To shore up its balance sheet, the company since has sold billions of dollars in assets both in China and abroad. Wanda\u2019s Hong Kong-listed unit said Monday in a regulatory filing that it was selling two Australian real-estate projects as part of those efforts.  Wanda faced a September deadline to relist Wanda Commercial or repay investors in full plus interest of up to 10%, a person familiar with the transaction said.  The investors\u2019 stake, which collectively equals 14%, will be transferred to the new group and could clear a path for regulators to approve Wanda Commercial\u2019s relisting in Shanghai. The sale also represents a 22% premium over what investors originally paid to delist the stake.

TCEHY -3.15% \u2014dominant forces in e-commerce, mobile payments and social media\u2014now are elbowing their way into autos, threatening established car makers.  These three companies\u2014the so-called BATs\u2014are plowing millions of dollars into electric-vehicle startups, car-sharing services and online retailers, as well as software platforms for autonomous driving and online car selling.  U.S. tech companies, notably Alphabet Inc. and its self-driving car unit Waymo, also are pushing into the auto sector. But the BAT companies have a big advantage in China, where tight government internet controls make it difficult for foreign enterprises to compete. For example, non-Chinese companies aren\u2019t allowed to operate digital mapping systems needed for autonomous driving.  BAT-Mobiles Chinese tech giants Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent have become major players in the auto business. Their interests span from electric-vehicle startups to smartcar software and online retail channels. Major BAT activities since 2013 Baidu Baidu Alibaba Alibaba Tencent Tencent Filter by Type All Partnership Software EV Ride-hailing Car-retail \u2014 TAP HOVER FOR DETAIL\u2014 Sources: Dealogic, staff reports  That has prompted both foreign and domestic auto companies like Ford Motor Co. , BMW AG , SAIC Motor Corp. and Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co. to seal tech partnerships with the BAT firms. This month, Renault SA said it is aiming for a fivefold increase in Chinese sales by 2023 as the result of a deal to sell cars on Alibaba\u2019s online retail platforms. Renault also said it would start using Alibaba\u2019s connectivity software in its cars in China.  The threat posed by China\u2019s internet giants was underscored when Li Shufu, the founder of Zhejiang Geely, announced last month that the company would invest $9 billion in a 9.7% stake in Mercedes-Benz parent Daimler AG .  \u201cThe competitors that challenge the global car industry in the 21st century technologically are not part of the automotive industry today,\u201d Mr. Li said in a statement. \u201cNo current car industry player will be able to win this battle against the invaders from outside independently.\u201d  Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent are betting that the auto industry is going to shift from selling hardware to selling services, with revenues derived mainly from selling subscriptions to features like shared autonomous vehicles and high-speed mobile internet.  \u201cThe BATs want people in cars using their online services. They see mobility as an on-ramp into their ecosystems,\u201d said Bill Russo, an ex-Chrysler executive who now runs Shanghai consultancy Automobility. \u201cSo they\u2019re all actively investing in mobility... This is a game that\u2019s not happening anywhere else. It\u2019s what makes China so unique.\u201d  Baidu Chief Executive Robin Li has made developing self-driving cars a priority for the search and mapping company. \u201cIn future commutes, you won\u2019t have to focus much on driving anymore,\u201d he said, on the sidelines of China\u2019s annual legislative session in Beijing this week. \u201cYou\u2019ll be able to have hot pot and sing karaoke on the ride.\u201d  Chen Hong, chairman of SAIC Motor, China\u2019s biggest car maker, speaking separately at the legislative session, acknowledged the tech giants\u2019 threat but said traditional auto makers have an edge in understanding drivers and their needs.  Still, these auto makers need partners. SAIC has launched an internet-connected car powered by AliOS, Alibaba\u2019s in-car operating system. Two big state-run car makers, Beijing Auto and Guangzhou Auto, are developing similar so-called smartcars with Baidu and Tencent respectively. Last year, Ford and BMW both said they, too, would launch smartcars using Alibaba\u2019s software.  The BATs are also generously bankrolling startups that are making smartcars slated to hit the China market later this year.  Alibaba-backed startup Xpeng Motor\u2019s new G3 SUV comes loaded with maps, music apps, Mandarin voice recognition and even a camera mounted on the roof, for buyers looking to post their travels on social media. Alibaba\u2019s technology and its knowledge of the consumer, accrued over nearly two decades as China\u2019s biggest e-commerce player, is helping Xpeng develop and grow quickly, said founder Xiaopeng He.  Traditional car makers need the BATs\u2019 strategic insights in a fast-changing marketplace, said Freeman Shen, whose electric-vehicle startup WM Motor is backed by Baidu and Tencent. Unless auto makers work with the BATs, said Mr. Shen, a former Geely executive, \u201cI don\u2019t think they can survive.\u201d  Baidu and Tencent are also investors in Shanghai-based NIO, whose debut electric vehicle has a voice-operated personal assistant, is able to park itself and comes loaded with apps provided by its two big tech backers.  The automobile is turning into a \u201cmobile living space,\u201d said NIO founder William Li. The passenger is a captive audience for internet services\u2014hence the BATs\u2019 interest in autos as potential channels for everything from online shopping to videogames to mobile TV.  All three companies have also invested in Didi Chuxing, China\u2019s answer to Uber. And Tencent, hedging its bets beyond China, last year bought 5% of Tesla Inc . for $1.78 billion.  For now, auto makers and tech companies can coexist by marrying car-making expertise with software innovation. \u201cWhen you put these two together you get a fantastic chemical reaction,\u201d said Simon Hu, who runs Alibaba\u2019s AliOS car operating-system division.  But as China\u2019s tech giants permeate the auto industry from all angles, the big question is: How much of the sector\u2019s revenues will they manage to commandeer? \u201cThe BATs have the bucks required to get into this game and stay in the game for however long it takes to win,\u201d said Michael Dunne, a Hong Kong-based auto consultant.  \u2014Yoko Kubota in Beijing contributed to this article.

A billboard ad on Los Angeles\u2019s Sunset Strip can cost $140,000 per month, said Barry Lowenthal, president of The Media Kitchen, a New York-based media buyer.  \u201cThis is a smart move for Netflix because it is a very important viewing market,\u201d Lowenthal said. \u201cLos Angeles matters to the people in the industry.\u201d  Tech firms Amazon.com Inc, Hulu and Facebook Inc and traditional media companies such as Walt Disney Co are all vying with Netflix to win subscribers.  Netflix is just one of the bidders for Los Angeles-based Regency Outdoor and there is no certainty that its offer will prevail, the sources said this week, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential.  Netflix declined to comment. Its shares were close to unchanged in a slightly lower market. Regency Outdoor did not respond to a request for comment.  ANALOGue ADS, DIGITAL CONTENT  The world\u2019s leading streaming media company still uses physical advertising space such as billboards to promote its shows. Billboards are holding their own compared to other forms of traditional advertising such as ads in newspapers or TV that are easy to skip.  Regency Outdoor, owned by brothers Drake and Brian Kennedy, owns billboards on Sunset Strip, a portion of Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles known for its live music and night clubs and filled with splashy billboards promoting upcoming TV shows and movies.  It also has billboards at Los Angeles International Airport, on major freeways, near the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) campus, and close to the Los Angeles Angels baseball stadium, according to the company\u2019s website.  Netflix said in a letter to shareholders earlier this year that its marketing spending was growing \u201ca little faster\u201d than its revenue.  As a result of the bigger marketing expenditure, Netflix\u2019s expenses per subscriber will jump around 25 percent to $16 per subscriber, up from $13 per subscriber, according to a recent MoffettNathanson report. The company reported it had 117.6 million worldwide streaming subscribers at the end of 2017, more than any direct competitor.  \u201cAs the marketplace for original content becomes more crowded, Netflix is turning up the volume to promote the increasing number of Netflix originals,\u201d Michael Nathanson, a MoffettNathanson analyst, wrote in the research note.  Netflix\u2019s first known acquisition was last year\u2019s purchase of comic book publisher Millarworld for an undisclosed sum.

It has also spurred rivals like Walt Disney Co. to invest more in online services and acquire competitors. Yet Netflix enjoys a head start on all those players.

That sparked the ire of Canadian media companies that must apply the tax, including on streaming units they set up to compete with Netflix.  \u201cFor services, Netflix and others, we are proposing legislative measures that will force these companies to register for our provincial sales tax regime,\u201d Leitao said Tuesday at a press conference in Quebec City. \u201cThey will need to collect the sales tax and to send it to us.\u201d  For companies selling goods online, Quebec will follow the approach recommended by the Organization for Economic Co- Operation and Development, which is to collect taxes at the border, Leitao said.  Starting Jan. 1, foreign companies that sell more than C$30,000 a year in taxable supplies of goods or services to Quebec consumers will be required to register for the provincial sales tax, budget documents show. Until now, suppliers without a physical or significant presence in the province weren\u2019t required to register for the tax, or to collect or remit it.  Canadian companies that don\u2019t have a physical or significant presence in Quebec will get eight more months to adjust: they won\u2019t be required to register for the provincial sales tax until Sept. 1, 2019.  \u201cGiven the Canadian economy\u2019s high level of integration, a potentially significant number of businesses of all sizes may be impacted,\u201d the finance ministry\u2019s document says.  Premier Philippe Couillard, who is running for re-election in October, is following up on a pledge to collect the money from online sellers after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau ruled out additional taxes. The C$270 million that is eluding Quebec\u2019s coffers represents about 1.3 percent of annual sales tax receipts, according to the government.  Other countries that have adopted similar taxes on foreign companies include Australia and Singapore, according to the budget.", "stock": "NFLX"}, {"url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-23/netflix-seeks-to-woo-debt-buyers-with-100-billion-stock-cushion", "label": 1, "source": "bloomberg", "date": "2018-01-23", "article": "Netflix Inc. is using its newly minted $100 billion market capitalization to tout a return to the junk-bond market, but debt investors may cast a skeptical eye on the online TV network.  \u201cWhen will the company ever produce positive free cash flow?\" Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Stephen Flynn said in an interview. \"The challenge for a bondholder is your upside is not the same as it is for an equity holder.\u201d  Netflix has tapped debt markets before to fund the production of TV shows and movies, and said Monday it would increase the budget for marketing of programs, as well as technology.

At 6 percent, its ratio is significantly lower than those of higher-rated media companies such as Walt Disney Co. and Viacom Inc.  \u201cIf you\u2019re in Netflix\u2019s position, it\u2019s something you should talk about,\u201d Flynn said. \u201cIt\u2019s the best way to position your credit profile.\u201d  A representative from Netflix declined to comment.  Subscriber Growth  The world\u2019s largest online TV network reported its strongest year of subscriber growth to date, propelling its market capitalization in line with the likes of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Qualcomm Inc. Its shares jumped as much as 13 percent to $257.71 in New York.  Yet splurging on new shows comes at a cost. The company has said it will spend as much as $8 billion on programming this year, and disclosed Monday it will shell out another $2 billion for marketing. Long-term debt stood at $6.5 billion at year-end, while long-term content liabilities totaled $3.33 billion.  The stock surge prompted multiple equity analysts to raise their price targets on the stock, but the optimism wasn\u2019t shared by all. Matthew Harrigan, an analyst at Buckingham Research Group, downgraded the stock to neutral from buy, saying he\u2019s skeptical that the company can replicate its domestic success abroad, especially in Asia where the local competition is dense and Netflix lacks pricing power.  \u201cYou\u2019ve got to step back and do a sanity check on this,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a great product and are competing with other great media companies. But this isn\u2019t like Amazon, where it has the opportunity to take over the world with AI and penetrate every retail category.\u201d  Chief Financial Officer David Wells said on an earnings call late Monday that as the company continues to build its content, some of the factors influencing its working capital needs have started to moderate.  \u201cAs our operating profit grows, we\u2019ll be able to pay more for that organically,\u201d he said.  Content and subscriber growth are the roots to Netflix\u2019s success, which is why it\u2019s hard to see the company pulling back from that to help turn cash flow positive, said Rahim Shad, a high-yield analyst at Invesco Ltd.  \u201cWith Hulu and Amazon making their own strides in original content, you almost have to spend your way to remain relevant and successful at this game,\u201d Shad said in an interview. The upside case for the bonds would be a takeover by an investment-grade company like Apple Inc., as Disney plans to acquire a majority of 21st Century Fox Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. is already developing its own content, he said.  Netflix also said it doesn\u2019t expect the new limitation on interest deductibility in the recently passed U.S. tax law to affect its business. That aspect of the law has been seen to deal a blow to junk-rated companies, especially those rated B and lower. Netflix is rated B1 by Moody\u2019s Investors Service and an equivalent B+ by S&P Global Ratings.  \u2014 With assistance by Sridhar Natarajan, and Lucas Shaw", "stock": "NFLX"}, {"url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-27/-deletenetflix-campaign-erupts-in-brazil-over-corruption-show", "label": -1, "source": "bloomberg", "date": "2018-03-27", "article": "While the world rebels against Facebook Inc., Netflix Inc. is stirring up controversy in Brazil.  A small but loud #DeleteNetflix campaign has burst forth on Twitter since \"The Mechanism,\" a show that is a work of fiction based on the real-life, multi-year corruption probe dubbed Carwash, was added to the streaming service Friday. Ex-users are posting proof of their now-defunct accounts in one of Netflix\u2019s most successful international markets.  Former President Dilma Rousseff, who was impeached in 2016 amid fallout from the scandal, called the show \"underhanded and full of lies.\" Prominent movie critic Pablo Villaca said he canceled his subscription after six years and encouraged others to do the same, saying the decision to air the show was \"irresponsible.\"  \"The director invents facts. He doesn\u2019t merely reproduce fake news. He has turned himself into a creator of fake news,\" according to a post on Rousseff\u2019s website. \"It would be like if a movie about the last moments of John Kennedy inserted a Lee Harvey Oswald character making accusations against the victim. Or a movie where Winston Churchill makes a deal with Adolf Hitler to attack the United States.\"  The debacle took over local media, with director Jose Padilha, who also produced the Netflix hit \"Narcos,\" responding that critics are too focused on the details and missing the bigger picture.  While this isn\u2019t the first portrayal of the corruption probe that continues sweeping through Brazil\u2019s political and business elite, the timing of the release -- on the day the operation hit its 50th phase -- has helped fuel some of the reaction.  After successive scandals that almost took down a second president in as many years, most of Congress and the presidency will be up for grabs in general elections in October. On Monday, former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva had a 12-year prison sentence for corruption confirmed by an appeals court. He awaits a Supreme Court ruling that will determine whether or not he will be arrested, and with that, influence the role he will play in the elections.  Lula leads all voter polls, and he has repeatedly reiterated his innocence and denounced the Carwash investigation as political persecution, saying he will fight until the very end.  Sergio Moro, the judge who became the face of the Carwash probe and hailed by some Brazilians as a savior of sorts for locking up corrupt politicians and businessmen, said in an TV interview Monday that while there are artistic liberties in both the movie and the show, drawing attention to Brazil\u2019s issue with corruption is important.  The show changed the names of those involved in the case -- Petrobras, as the state-run oil company at the center of the investigation is known, became Petrobrasil. Alberto Youssef, Brazil\u2019s black-market central banker who was one of the to be caught up in the probe, is portrayed as Roberto Ibrahim.  One of the biggest points of controversy is a conversation in which a politician -- who resembles Lula -- talks about an agreement to prevent the corruption probe from proceeding. The episode alludes to a political crisis surrounding President Michel Temer, which took down then-Planning Minister Romero Juca after a recording of a similar conversation between himself and a former executive linked to Petrobras emerged.  \"The left was and is just as corrupt as the right. \u2018The Mechanism\u2019 has no ideology,\" Padilha is cited as saying in Estado de S.Paulo newspaper.  Netflix is no stranger to Brazilian political drama. The company placed large ads at the Brasilia airport -- the nation\u2019s capital, where much of the Carwash probe has taken place -- to promote the latest season of House of Cards. When news broke in May that a businessman had secretly recorded the president allegedly discussing hush money in a fresh round of scandal that almost took down the government, that show\u2019s profile tweeted -- in Portuguese -- \"It\u2019s getting hard to compete.\"  On Tuesday, Netflix\u2019s official Twitter account in Brazil posted a video with a mock ad for a \"corruption store\" featuring products such as fashionable covers for ankle monitors and underwear with pockets to better store bribes.  Netflix didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment on the impact of the show, viewership or subscription data.  \u2014 With assistance by Paula Sambo, and Fabiola Moura", "stock": "NFLX"}, {"url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-09/obamas-in-talks-for-a-programming-deal-with-netflix-nyt-reports", "label": 0, "source": "bloomberg", "date": "2018-03-09", "article": "Netflix Inc. is in talks to pay Barack and Michelle Obama for a series of original shows, the New York Times reported, a potential return to the global limelight for the former president and first lady.

The rapid pace of subscriber additions is impressive, but so is the amount of cash going up in flames.  Netflix Inc. is the Uber of the entertainment programming business. Whether Netflix investors recoil or cheer at the comparison depends on their risk tolerance.  Netflix doesn't share Uber's inclination to push boundaries, and it has a well-functioning business. But both companies are impressive growth machines that rely on outside funding to maintain the momentum. And in both cases, it's not clear what the real trajectory of the business would look like if access to capital dried up.  First, let's run through the impressive growth part of the Netflix machine.  Growing Like a Weed Netflix keeps adding streaming video subscribers rapidly Source: Bloomberg  Netflix said on Monday that it added 8.3 million more subscribers than it lost for its streaming service. That was the most new streaming customers in Netflix's history. Even in the U.S., where analysts believe more than half of households with fast internet service already subscribe to Netflix, the company added more net new streaming customers in 2017 than it did the year before. The continued pace of customer additions validates both Netflix's recent decision to raise prices on many subscribers in the U.S. and to go all-in on a globalization strategy the company unveiled two years ago.  But just like at Uber, growth comes at a cost for Netflix. That cost is the piles of money Netflix has set alight for three years to finance its globe-trotting ambitions, and to purchase -- rather than rent -- more of the TV shows and movies the company makes available to streaming subscribers. The cash costs for Netflix's streaming programming reached $8.9 billion in 2017, about double the costs from two years earlier. The number of Netflix streaming customers hasn't increased as much, at about 60 percent, over that period.  Bonfire Netflix's free cash flow has turned negative in the last three years as the company splurged on programming and international expansion Source: Netflix  Netflix also said its free cash flow would widen to as much as negative $4 billion in 2018, compared with an already stunning negative $2 billion in 2017. Netflix has already been clear it won't generate positive cash flow for years as it tries to become the preferred entertainment source for the world, and one that has profitable economics. But potentially burning through $4 billion in cash is staggering. Netflix and Uber are betting that the companies should lean into their growth and spend even more to get bigger fast. It could turn out to be a stellar bet. Or fail spectacularly.  Netflix's strategy means two things: The company must keep churning out shows compelling enough to persuade more people to subscribe, and it needs to be able to continue borrowing money at low cost to finance its losses.  So far, Netflix stock and debt investors aren't worried. Netflix bonds due in 2026 have been trading just below 100 cents on the dollar. Netflix shares shot up about 9 percent in after-hours trading after the company released its financial results. Already the company's enterprise value is more than 50 times estimated 2018 earnings excluding interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and employee stock compensation costs. Those are not characteristics indicating signs of worry.  It's hard to find fault with Netflix's execution or its track record. The company is making a rational decision to splurge while it can and borrow money while it's cheap. But no one knows what Netflix looks like in normal funding times. What happens if the debt market isn't as compliant in coming years? The Netflix growth machine suddenly looks less like a sure thing. I'd call it a roller-coaster ride, but at least roller coasters tend to follow a predictable trajectory and wind up exactly where they started.

Netflix, which released its first original series just six years ago, has now lured two of the most successful producers in TV -- Murphy and Shonda Rhimes -- from two of the industry\u2019s most valuable companies. Rhimes, the producer of \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d and \u201cScandal,\u201d bolted from Walt Disney Co.\u2019s ABC in August.  No longer content to license shows from other media companies, Netflix and fellow technology giant Amazon.com Inc. are throwing money at Hollywood\u2019s top talent to lure them away from those studios. They are upending the TV business in the process, driving up the cost of talent and weakening many of the traditional powers.  Ryan Murphy Photographer: Monica Schipper/Getty Images for Entertainment Weekly  Hollywood studios have endured threats from outsiders before, but the list of talent making the jump grows by the day.  Horror Story  Netflix, with an annual budget of $8 billion, is paying Murphy, the producer of \u201cAmerican Horror Story,\u201d about $300 million over five years to make shows and movies for the streaming service. The money will support overhead for Ryan Murphy Productions along with his fees for writing, directing and producing.  Murphy was in the process of negotiating a new deal at Fox when Disney agreed to buy its crosstown rival for more than $52 billion. Disney Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger made a personal call to Murphy, assuring him that \u201cthe reason Disney was interested in buying Fox is they believed in the assets and the executives and their creators,\u201d the producer recalled. \u201cHe was very sweet and transparent and kind.\u201d  Shondaland  Shonda Rhimes Photographer: Bryan Bedder/Getty Images for Vulture Festival  Rhimes was the biggest name to leave traditional TV for streaming when she announced she was signing a long-term deal with Netflix. She\u2019d worked at ABC for more than a decade, becoming one of the few showrunners and TV writers known to the public.  Rhimes is also one of the few prominent black showrunners in Hollywood, and has led the way in creating more diversity onscreen. Netflix gave her more than $100 million to ease the transition in a multiyear deal.  Zombies  Robert Kirkman Photographer: Tommaso Boddi/Getty Images for AMC  Robert Kirkman, the creator of cable TV\u2019s biggest hit, \u201cThe Walking Dead,\u201d signed a two-year deal with Amazon last August, days before Netflix announced its deal with Rhimes. Amazon spent an estimated $4.5 billion on video programming last year and plans to increase its budget this year. Amazon\u2019s \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u201d won the Golden Globe award for best TV comedy.  Millarworld  Mark Millar Photographer: Karwai Tang/WireImage via Getty Images  Netflix knows its customers love comic book movies and TV shows thanks to a pair of deals with Disney, owner of Marvel Studios. So last year it acquired the company that published graphic novels \u201cWanted\u201d and \u201cKick-Ass,\u201d both of which were adapted into hit movies for Universal Pictures.  Netflix and Millarworld founder Mark Millar will jointly produce films, series and children\u2019s shows based on comic-book characters for the streaming service, while the publisher will also continue to make comics under the Netflix label. The streaming service will turn some of Millar\u2019s other creations into film and TV properties that can replace Marvel when its deal with Disney ends.  New Golden Boy  Shawn Levy Photographer: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images  Shawn Levy rose through the ranks of Hollywood by directing comedy films for major studios, including \u201cCheaper by the Dozen\u201d and \u201cNight at the Museum.\u201d Yet he has since been reborn as one of the hottest producers in TV thanks to \u201cStranger Things,\u201d the surprise Netflix fantasy hit. The streaming service locked up Levy\u2019s TV business last year, and now funnels all kinds of high-concept projects his way.  Amazon has also allied itself with Sharon Horgan, the British comic and actress who created its critically beloved comedy \u201cCatastrophe.\u201d Though Horgan has a show on HBO (\u201cDivorce\u201d), Amazon gets first dibs on all future work.", "stock": "NFLX"}, {"url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-27/help-wanted-netflix-movie-publicist-400-000-including-options", "label": -1, "source": "bloomberg", "date": "2018-03-27", "article": "Netflix Inc. has turned heads in Hollywood by spending billions of dollars to lure filmmakers and viewers from rival TV networks.

Recruits are securing as much as double their pay, including stock and other benefits, people familiar with the matter say.  Hiring Spree Netflix's payroll jumped with the company's global expansion and original programs Source: Company reports  With $10 billion for programming and marketing this year -- and a stock that\u2019s vying again to lead the S&P 500-- Los Gatos, California-based Netflix is upending the way people get paid in Hollywood. TV networks and studios are struggling to keep up with a rival who will spend $300 million on a top producer like Ryan Murphy and pay lavishly further down the food chain.  \u201cWith combinations of base, bonus, equity and long-term incentive, new-media companies are figuring out ways to beat traditional studios,\u201d said Neal Lenarsky, founder of STI Management, which represents executives in the media industry.  Old Hollywood is trying to respond. Some studios have pulled back from selling shows to the online service. Walt Disney Co. went so far as to yank its movies from the company and is launching streaming services of its own. 21st Century Fox Inc. sued in 2016, claiming the company induced executives to breach their contracts. Netflix countersued, and the case is inching along.  Few Titles  None of that is stopping Netflix from attracting publicists with as much as $400,000 in salary and other compensation, or about double their prior paychecks, according to the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private compensation data. More senior professionals are seeing similar increases, said one executive who was approached by Netflix.  In making offers, Netflix estimates a candidate\u2019s value based on experience and title, according to employees who asked not to be identified discussing company policy. Then it pays the recruit at the top of what the corresponding range might be. The company also allows candidates to take as much a 50 percent of their compensation in options, they said. A recent change in California law bars employers from asking applicants about their prior salary.  Titles at Netflix don\u2019t necessarily correspond with Hollywood convention. For the most part, the company has just three executive roles -- director, manager and vice president -- and some represent real promotions for people jumping over. Netflix also lets some staffers see what co-workers earn via an internal database, according to the people.  And while many studios reward employees with amenities like a large personal office and titles that seem to confer prestige, almost no one at Netflix has an office. Not even Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings, who co-founded the company.  Netflix employed more than 5,400 people at year-end, fewer people than its competitors in media, and sales are projected to reach $15.8 billion this year. CBS Corp., owner of the CBS and Showtime TV networks, has a payroll of more 12,000 and revenue projected at $14.5 billion this year.  Perhaps nowhere is Netflix more aggressive than in marketing and public relations. The company will spend about $2 billion promoting its service and shows this year. The company lists almost 500 openings on its website, with about a third in Los Angeles and more than 50 in marketing and PR.  Where the Jobs Are Locations of recent job openings listed at the Netflix website Source: Company website  Once wholly dependent on older movies and TV shows licensed from other companies, Netflix will release 700 original programs this year, including 80 movies. A growing share is produced in-house by Netflix Studios, based in the company\u2019s Hollywood offices.  Producing and promoting those shows requires an expanding legion of employees, from colorists to sound engineers to publicists. Netflix is looking to hire dozens of executives for production and post-production jobs, and still more for marketing.  Experienced staffers are in short supply, forcing Netflix to raid rivals who also happen to be programming suppliers. Last year, Netflix hired Bela Bajaria, formerly with Comcast Corp.\u2019s Universal Television, to oversee unscripted TV, as well as Scott Stuber, a producer based at Universal Pictures, to run feature films. Julie Fontaine, executive vice president of movie publicity at Lions Gate Entertainment Corp., jumped to a similar post. The company has recruited dozens of PR people from agencies and studios including Fox and Disney.  Pleasing Investors  Some analysts have questioned Netflix\u2019s outlays, arguing there\u2019s no way the company can turn a profit while spending at its current pace. But CEO Hastings and his team have satisfied investors by delivering record subscriber growth.  \u201cThere are fewer and fewer services a TV studio can provide an artist or producer that Netflix can\u2019t,\u201d said Anthony DiClemente, an analyst with Evercore ISI. \u201cWall Street investors right now don\u2019t care how much they spend on content and infrastructure as long as subscribers are growing and beating estimates.\u201d  Hastings was asked about sky-high talent spending at a recent event at the company\u2019s Hollywood offices. Besides Ryan Murphy, Netflix also snared Shonda Rhimes, at producer at Disney\u2019s ABC, in a deal valued at more than $100 million.  \u201cDo we worry about overpaying?

Bloomberg\u2019s Alex Barinka reports. (Source: Bloomberg)  Spotify made no direct comparison to Netflix in a filing Wednesday announcing its plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange, but its pitch to investors rests on a similar thesis to the one driving Netflix shares, which are the best-performing on the S&P 500 this year. Spotify even has the same chief financial officer who took Netflix public -- Barry McCarthy -- and Netflix\u2019s chief content officer Ted Sarandos sits on Spotify\u2019s board.  Read more about the Spotify filing in this Gadfly piece.  The internet has changed the way people consume entertainment, creating an opening for new players to upend sclerotic businesses. Much as Netflix offered customers a cheaper, more convenient alternative to DVDs and pay TV, Spotify has given consumers a reason not to buy CDs from Walmart or songs from iTunes.  \u201cSpotify has transformed the way people access and enjoy music,\u201d the company said in the filing. \u201cToday, millions of people around the world have access to over 35 million tracks through Spotify, whenever and wherever they want.\u201d  Like Netflix, Spotify offers consumers access to a head-spinning selection of content, personalized to their tastes. And like Netflix, Spotify carved out a huge lead, and is now being chased by the biggest players in technology and media.  Big Opportunities?  The world is still in the early stages of the shift to online distribution of movies, TV and music, and the race is on to sign people up all over the world. Netflix, with almost 118 million subscribers worldwide, has allayed concerns about its slowing growth by reminding analysts there are more than 700 million broadband households. Spotify, with 71 million paying users, touts an even larger number in its filing: 1.6 billion payment-enabled smartphone owners expected by 2021.  Being the biggest comes at a cost. Netflix is burning through cash to acquire more programming, telling investors it\u2019s to fund future growth. Spotify delivers more than 70 percent of its sales to music rights holders, despite efforts to improve profit margins.  Sarandos is where the comparisons between Netflix and Spotify get tricky. Netflix, which already forsook DVDs for online streaming, is in the midst of another great evolution. It is building its own studio to produce shows on its own.  Breaking Through  Spotify says it has no interest in signing artists, or paying for artists to record. However, it has another plan to reduce its reliance on its main suppliers: by making them less relevant.  \u201cThe old model favored certain gatekeepers. Artists had to be signed to a label,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Daniel Ek wrote in a letter included in the filing. \u201cThey needed access to a recording studio, and they had to be played on terrestrial radio to achieve success.

Netflix joins the array of U.S., European and Asian companies whose earnings are getting a lift from quickened global economic growth. Meanwhile, U.S. tax cuts should give American companies like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. the chance to reward investors with goodies such as buybacks on top of bonuses they\u2019ve already sprinkled out to workers.  Not every CEO will have as pleasant news to deliver as Netflix\u2019s Reed Hastings. Stung by an October earnings call that went awry, Oscar Munoz on Tuesday afternoon is scheduled to report United Continental Inc.\u2019s second straight annual profit decline. And speculation is mounting that John Flannery will have to cut General Electric Co.\u2019s 2018 profit outlook on Wednesday due to deep problems in the company\u2019s industrial and finance operations.  With more than a tenth of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 companies already reported, profit\u2019s up 14 percent from a year earlier while sales have risen about 8 percent. Here are a few things to watch:  The Tax Man cometh and he\u2019s got good news  The lower corporate tax rate Congress approved late last year has already helped some companies boost profit forecasts for 2018 -- and they\u2019ve entered earnings season willing to share the largess. Macquarie Research estimates most U.S. airlines will see an average 20 percent increase in earnings per share. The benefits will hit first for cash taxpayers like Southwest Airlines Co., which reports Thursday and has already announced bonuses of $1,000 for its workers.  Wal-Mart is getting a roughly $2 billion tax benefit, and analysts expect it to boost share buybacks and potentially cut prices in addition to the worker raises and bonuses it\u2019s already announced. The world\u2019s largest retailer reports Feb. 20.  While Verizon Communications Inc. reported earnings that missed estimates Tuesday, it said it expects a massive windfall from the tax cut to boost 2018 cash flow by $3.5 billion to $4 billion. The largest U.S. wireless carrier hinted it may also reward bonuses, saying in a statement that it will make an announcement later in the day on \u201chow employees will further share in the company\u2019s success.\u201d  Lower tax = more growth = more shovels  The U.S. tax cut contributed to expectations for faster global growth, and that should help companies that sell goods and services worldwide. The International Monetary Fund this week said it expects the world economy to jump 3.9 percent this year and next -- in each case a 0.2 percentage point bump from its projection in October.  With that growth comes more digging, paving and loading, and analysts have raised 2018 forecasts for Caterpillar Inc. even as it wraps its strongest earnings year since 2012 with Thursday\u2019s report. Those roads need more cars, and IHS Markit predicts global auto sales will rise about 1.5 percent in 2018. General Motors Co. has forecast its profit this year will be consistent with a record of as much as $6.50 a share for 2017.  Global Growth Bodes Well for Earnings The fastest global growth in seven years should help lift corporate profits in 2018 Source: IMF economic forecast  Heady times don\u2019t prevent FX headwinds  The strong global economy can only go so far -- corporate earnings are also exposed to the whims of foreign exchange. The euro gained against every major currency in 2017 and strengthened further in January, so expect more profit warnings from European companies like the one last week from Paris-based distiller Remy Cointreau SA. Luxury conglomerate LVMH, which reports Thursday after the Paris stock market closes, and German software maker SAP AG, which reports Jan. 30, are among others that may be hurt by the euro. The question is how big of a hit, and whether it\u2019s already reflected in stock prices.  Euro Beat All Major Currencies Last Year The strengthened euro is likely to hurt European company earnings this season  The flipside? The dollar\u2019s decline against most major currencies should give a boost to U.S. exporters and companies that translate foreign sales back into dollars. PPG Industries Inc. said last week, for example, that the weaker greenback would increase the paint-maker\u2019s 2018 revenue by as much as $300 million. Post-it Notes maker 3M Co., which generates about 60 percent of its sales overseas, reports on Thursday and expects favorable exchange rates to add 10 cents a share to profit this year.  Can profits stay ahead of energy costs?  While surging oil prices will benefit energy companies, they\u2019re also having a wider effect. Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. last week said fourth-quarter earnings got a boost from rising crude prices and growing shipments of other commodities. For chemical makers like DowDuPont Inc., which reports Feb. 1, a big question is whether product prices can rise fast enough to recoup higher costs for oil-derived raw materials.  An iPhone\u2019s ring is heard round the world  And as always, investors will be watching Apple Inc., the world\u2019s most valuable company, when it reports Feb. 1 for signs of how demand is faring for the iPhone X. The results are likely to affect Asian suppliers. South Korea\u2019s LG Display Co. reported Tuesday that operating profit missed the lowest analyst estimate. The news came about a week after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. forecast revenue that fell short of expectations, as waning smartphone sales in China and a strong local currency outweighed booming demand from cryptocurrency miners. Samsung Electronics Co., a supplier and rival to Apple, reported lower-than-projected profit this month as it lost momentum in memory chips.  \u2014 With assistance by Dave McCombs, Nick Turner, Tara Patel, Crayton Harrison, Rebecca Penty, Rick Clough, Julie Johnsson, Jack Kaskey, Mary Schlangenstein, Joe Deaux, Scott Moritz, and Jessica Brice", "stock": "NFLX"}, {"url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-15/cbs-overcomes-ad-slump-with-gains-in-subscriber-fees-show-sales", "label": 1, "source": "bloomberg", "date": "2018-02-15", "article": "CBS Corp., owner of the most-watched TV network in the U.S., has come up with a solution to investor concerns about the future of the TV business: make more shows like \u201cStar Trek: Discovery.\u201d  The media company has doubled the number of programs it produces in recent years, creating shows for its own TV channels and streaming services, and others for tech giants Netflix, Amazon and Apple.

To be the first to know, please click here.  As Netflix continues to ramp up its annual content investment, the streamer has effectively changed the paradigm for content producers in a way that both expands and limits opportunities for producers and studios as well as for rival networks competing for the best content and talent, per Digiday.  Netflix CFO David Wells said recently that in 2018, Netflix will spend $8 billion and produce 700 pieces of original content, including 80 full-length original movies and 80 foreign-language original productions from local international territories where Netflix operates.  Thanks to its massive spending, Netflix has created a seller's market for producers and studios. Here are some of the fundamental ways that the new paradigm initiated under Netflix has benefited content producers:  There are more opportunities to sell content because Netflix is such a major buyer. In addition to buying more shows than other platforms and networks, Netflix also buys more episodes.  Netflix pays producers more money upfront than other programmers.  Netflix is mostly hands-off once it agrees to buy a piece of content, and will largely give producers creative free rein over their projects.

Netflix has poached prolific US TV producer Ryan Murphy from 21st Century Fox in a deal worth up to $300 million, making it one of the biggest TV production deals ever signed, the Financial Times reports.  Murphy will begin creating content exclusively for Netflix in July, and the series he created at 21st Century Fox, including \"American Horror Story\" and \"Feud,\" will remain on the company's networks. The deal will deepen the existing relationship between Netflix and Murphy, who previously signed a deal to executively produce a Netflix series in February 2017.  Fox bid aggressively to retain Murphy, but the producer's decision to move to Netflix makes sense for two key reasons:  Murphy's dodging the uncertainty surrounding the Disney-Fox acquisition. Murphy maintains close relationships with Fox Television Group Chairman Dana Walden and 21st Century Fox President Peter Rice. However, should Disney's landmark acquisition of most of 21st Century Fox's assets close as expected, it's not guaranteed that Walden and Rice will remain in their roles. This uncertainty factored into Murphy's decision to move.  Murphy maintains close relationships with Fox Television Group Chairman Dana Walden and 21st Century Fox President Peter Rice. However, should Disney's landmark acquisition of most of 21st Century Fox's assets close as expected, it's not guaranteed that Walden and Rice will remain in their roles. This uncertainty factored into Murphy's decision to move. He's gaining the creative freedom that comes with producing for a video streaming service. Murphy is known for his graphic and shocking work, and although the producer had virtually full creative freedom at Fox, working at Netflix will likely allow him to further explore his creative boundaries \u2014 creators generally have to worry less about profanity and nudity when creating for Netflix, as it's not a platform driven by ad revenue.  The deal is representative of the intensifying battle between digital video services and traditional media companies for top Hollywood talent. In addition to Fox's bid, Amazon also made a serious bid for the top Hollywood producer, according to The New York Times. Video streaming services like Netflix and Amazon are aggressively pursuing top creators and entertainers as eyeballs shift away from linear TV in favor of digital platforms.  Netflix has been successful in luring top Hollywood talent in the past year. The company poached accomplished producers Shonda Rhimes and Betsy Beers from ABC in August 2017. Additionally, Netflix has been able to sign separate deals with former Late Show host David Letterman, and big-name stand-up comedians Chris Rock, Dave Chappelle, and Amy Schumer. Netflix plans to spend up to $8 billion on original content in 2018, up from $6 billion in 2017, and its budget eclipses those of rivals like Amazon and Hulu, positioning Netflix well to continue to court top Hollywood talent.

The international video-streaming market is large and unaddressed, and Netflix could eat much of it.  Netflix's original and exclusive content positions it well in many markets.  Follow Netflix in real time here.  Netflix is not even close to being finished growing, according to Morgan Stanley's Benjamin Swinburne, one of the company's biggest bulls on Wall Street.  Swinburne thinks Netflix is \"still in the early stages of global adoption,\" citing the largely untapped international market as one key area of growth potential.  Morgan Stanley, Netflix  But Netflix shares haven't been without their problems as of late. In late March, they were pressured after President Donald Trump announced plans to crack down down on Chinese investment in US technology. They were also hit hard in the wake of Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal. In all, they've fallen more than 10% from their record high of $334 to their current price of $298.  But Swinburne says fear not, Netflix will be hit a fresh record high in no time. He has a $350 price target and a bull-case-scenario target of $440, both of which are well above the Wall Street consensus of $288.  Netflix has roughly 120 million subscribers, but the total addressable market for video streaming is much larger \u2014 more than 660 million by Swinburne's count. He says that, coupled with Netflix's \"history of successfully scaling in a wide variety of markets,\" makes him optimistic on the company's future.  Of those 660 million+ addressable subscribers, Swinburne believes Netflix will capture more than 300 million by 2028. That would represent one third of global broadband, compared to the roughly 20% Netflix has captured thus far, according to the note.  One reason Swinburne thinks Netflix will take much of that large market is not simply because of its superior brand perception as the leader in movie streaming, but also because of the content it can poach. Swinburne identified Netflix's \"ability to maintain exclusive content offering to differentiate product from competitors, and to a lesser extent, success of original programming,\" as core \"key value drivers.\" Netflix is known for winning bids for top original content producers who can make new content, exclusively for its platform.  Swineburne also says not to forget the markets that got Netflix to where it is today. \"There remains a big opportunity in many of Netflix's older markets, as evidenced by continued strong growth in the US,\" he wrote.

The company reported earnings of $0.41 per share after the bell Monday on revenue of $3.29 billion, which sent the stock up over 10% in after hours trading.

High yield has rarely seen an equity cushion so thick.\"  The spending should help Netflix stave off any new competition as other companies develop their own streaming products, namely Disney, which is already pulling its content from Netflix and plans to launch its own service in 2019.  \"The market for entertainment time is vast and can support many successful services,\" Netflix said. \"In addition, entertainment services are often complementary given their unique content offerings. We believe this is largely why both we and Hulu have been able to succeed and grow.\"  So far, this strategy appears to be paying off, with smash hit originals like \"Stranger Things\" continuing to draw in new subscribers and offset any pushback from the price hike that went into effect in the fourth-quarter.

The Asian market has been notoriously difficult for Western companies to break into due to the challenges of local rivals, protectionist regulations, and cultural barriers to surmount. But Netflix could find a way in through Japan.  Japan is one of the largest markets the video-streaming company has entered, and has been considered \"the vanguard of Netflix's entrance into Asia \u2014 a market with not only a large user base but also different cultural dynamics surrounding content streaming,\" according to RBC Analyst Mark Mahaney.  The Japanese market has been hard for streaming companies to crack into because it is usually ahead of the US in terms of technology, meaning there's already a plethora of established \"freemium\" options for consumers to choose from.  However, recent trends show that Netflix is gaining some traction in the country, which could set the stage for a deeper penetration into Asia.  Though only 5% of respondents to an RBC survey said they watched Netflix \u2014 up from 3% in February 2017 \u2014 63% of Japanese subscribers said they were \"Extremely\" or \"Very\" satisfied with Netflix, and a record-high 31% of Japanese subscribers said they were \"Extremely,\" \"Very,\" or \"Moderately\" likely to pay for the streaming service, compared with 24% in the same month a year ago.  \"We believe that these results highlight that Netflix\u2019s entry into Japan is still early, but materially improving,\" Mahaney said.  Mahaney also looked at Google Trends data across the continent and found there were \"consistent upward trends\" in search results for \"Netflix\" in 2017 and into 2018. There have been studies that found a correlation between Google searches of the term \"Netflix\" and Netflix viewership numbers.  \"2017 appears to have been an early pivot year for Netflix in Asia and 2018 is showing good momentum so far,\" Mahaney wrote in a note.  There is also an opportunity to appeal to this large segment of the global population through its slate of new and original content planned for this year, Mahaney says.

With some of its recent successes, such as \"Bright,\" featuring Will Smith, the German production \"Dark,\" and the Oscar award-winning documentary, \"Icarus,\" Netflix has proven that it produces original content that will keep driving new and loyal subscribers back to its platform.  This is also helping the video streaming company draw some key Hollywood talent such as Ryan Murphy, the man behind \"American Horror Story\" and \"Glee,\" and Shonda Rhimes, the producer behind such hits as \"Grey's Anatomy\" and \"Scandal.\" The fact that Netflix is able to pull such high-profile names also keeps them away from competitors, Juenger notes.  \"While the price tag is high, the value of a 'hit show' for Netflix is also high, and it's nice to have your $12 billion in capable hands,\" Juenger said.  Netflix plans to spend billions of dollars on roughly 700 new original TV shows in 2018 as part of its strategy to build \"a global moat\" that would widen its competitive advantage, according to another Wall Street analyst.  In fact, investor confidence was so high for Netflix that a Stifel analyst downgraded the stock, claiming the \"share price may have sprinted ahead of fundamentals in the short-term.\"  Netflix was up 3.78% on Friday at $328.84 per share. It was up 63.62% for the year.

Kayenta is integrated into the Netflix-incubated Spinnaker continuous delivery platform, which works across virtually every public and private cloud. While Spinnaker is the focus of this release, though, Kayenta can also be adapted to other environments.  The general idea behind canary analysis is pretty straightforward. Like the name implies, this is an early warning system that is all about prevent major issues when you roll out an update to a service or your infrastructure. As you roll out an update to a subset of new users (or servers, or parts of your network), the canary analysis service checks whether the new system behaves as it should \u2014 or at least as well as the old one. At every step, the system performs its checks and ensures that you don\u2019t roll out an upgrade that may pass all of your regular tests but creates issues when thrown into a more complex production system.  As Google product manager Andrew Phillips told me, a lot of developers already do this, but it\u2019s often a rather informal process. Teams often build their apps, deploy it to a few servers, wait for a few minutes and then check their dashboards to look for obvious issues. That introduces the chance of human error and brings in the potential for bias. A canary analysis system, on the other hand, can evaluate the metrics and then (ideally) make an objective decision on whether the code is ready to ship or not. While most companies run automated tests to check their code for obvious errors, that kind of testing is often not enough when you want to put your code into production, especially if that production environment consists of a set of microservices that may end up interacting with each other in unexpected ways.  As is so often the case these days, with Kayenta, the Netflix team wants to open up its own system to bring the service to the wider community (and in return benefit from the community\u2019s advances, too). To do this, Netflix and Google also worked to rewrite the parts of Kayenta that were specific to Netflix, where the system grew rather organically. That doesn\u2019t necessarily make for good code, though, so with Kayenta, Google and Netflix also spent some time cleaning up the code and making it more modular. Indeed, as Netflix director of delivery engineering Andy Glover told me, the Google and Netflix teams spent about a year to get the code ready for today\u2019s release and one of the major areas of focus for both teams was making sure that the code was as modular as possible.  The fact that Google and Netflix already did some joint work on Spinnaker surely helped their efforts to get Kayenta off the ground, too. It also helps that canary analysis isn\u2019t exactly a competitive advantage for either company. As Phillips stressed, there is really no need for every enterprise to reinvent the wheel and this kind of project is all about \u201cgiving space-age tech to the masses.\u201d  Looking forward, the plan is to grow both the Kayenta and Spinnaker community. \u201cThe goodwill of Netflix and Google together has attracted a certain crowd of developers that have embraced Spinnaker,\u201d Glover noted. The Kayenta project will surely benefit from that. The Spinnaker Slack room already has over 4,000 participants, after all.  As Phillips also stressed, part of that interest is due to the simple fact that people need software delivery solutions and while there are plenty of options, a project that has the backing of Google and Netflix attracts a lot of attention by default. And given the backing of these two companies, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we saw some kind of commercial distribution of Spinnaker and Kayenta in the near future.", "stock": "NFLX"}, {"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/02/14/ryan-murphy-joins-netflix/", "label": 1, "source": "techcrunch", "date": "2018-02-14", "article": "Another high-profile TV producer is going all-in with Netflix: Ryan Murphy has signed what the streaming service describes as \u201ca multi-year deal to produce new series and films exclusively at Netflix, starting July 1, 2018.\u201d  Murphy\u2019s credits include Glee, American Horror Story, American Crime Story and The Normal Heart.

We\u2019ll get to the financial numbers in a minute but, as usual, the big story here is that it continues to wow Wall Street with impressive growth in its subscriber numbers. The company said it added more than 8 million new subscribers total after already setting pretty robust targets for the fourth quarter this year, giving it a healthy push as it crossed the $100 billion mark after the report came out this afternoon.  Here\u2019s the rundown:  Netflix\u2019s biggest challenge has been to aggressively invest in good original content that\u2019s going to bring in new subscribers. While its shows may clean up at various awards shows like the Emmys, it still has to show that it can convert those awards into raw subscribers. But thanks to what appears to be continuing success with its original content like Stranger Things, as well other returning seasons for shows like The Crown, it\u2019s been able to continue its staggering run.  While the company\u2019s core financials actually came in roughly in line with what Wall Street was looking for (which is still important), Netflix\u2019s subscriber numbers are usually the best indicator for the core health of the company. That recurring revenue stream \u2014 and its growth \u2014 is critical as it continues to very aggressively spend on new content. The company said its free cash flow will be between negative $3 billion and negative $4 billion, compared to negative $2 billion this year.  And that aggressive spend only seems to get more aggressive every time we hear from the company. Netflix is now saying that it expects to spend between $7.5 billion and $8 billion on content in 2018 \u2014 which is around in line with what it said in October when it said it would spend between $7 billion and $8 billion. It\u2019s the same range, but tuning up that bottom end is still an important indicator.  Netflix shows picked up 20 Emmy awards last year, but just having a shiny object on a shelf isn\u2019t something that\u2019s going to indicate that the company is going to continue to grow at a healthy clip. In the face of an increasingly crowded market, Netflix has to demonstrate its ability to continue to offer lasting value for subscribers \u2014 especially as it continues to grow abroad. The company, of course, has plenty of benefits in terms of how it handles its shows when it makes them itself.  The company also has to make sure its brand also fits that narrative, as it now finds itself dealing with issues like having to cancel House of Cards \u2014 and that has a monetary impact as well. Netflix said it took a $39 million \u201cnon-cash charge in Q4 for unreleased content we\u2019ve decided not to move forward with.\u201d The company didn\u2019t specify what content, but it\u2019s dealt with some issues in the past several months that might necessitate the need to recalibrate its slate.  Netflix also tucked another newsy bit into the report: the addition of new board member Rodolphe Belmer, former CEO of Canal+. As the company continues to expand internationally, bringing on people with experience like Belmer of course makes sense.

The roots of the company\u2019s bug hunting concept go back to 2013 when Netflix launched what it called a,\u201dresponsible vulnerability disclosure program.\u201d The idea continued to develop over the years and they launched a private bug bounty program on Bugcrowd in 2016. They started small with 100 researchers and today at the launch of the public program they have increased that number to 700, according to the blog post.  They report since inception they have been able to solve 145 issues, paying out a variety of bounties with the highest being $15,000. \u201cWe have attempted to fine tune things like triage quality, response time and researcher interactions to build a quality program that researchers like to participate in,\u201d the company wrote in the blog post announcing the program.  Netflix is far from alone in running these kinds of programs. Many big organizations like Facebook, Google and many others use bug bounty programs to pay researchers to find security holes on their platforms before black-hat hackers do. The idea is to provide financial incentive to find the bugs, rather than going in and exploiting the vulnerability for personal gain.  There is generally a leader board, so in addition to financial remuneration, the researcher also gets bragging rights and public acclaim for tracking down bugs. And it\u2019s not just traditional tech companies running these programs. General Motors has one running on the HackerOne platform and MasterCard has one on Bugcrowd.  Bugcrowd and other bug bounty platforms like HackerOne provide a way to administer the program, providing a way to recruit researchers, then letting them know which vulnerabilities they are looking for and how much they are willing to pay. To give you a sense of how lucrative these programs can be to hackers, Google released a report last month indicating it paid out almost $3 million in bounties last year with rewards ranging from $500 to $100,000.

Which, from a consumer point of view, sounds great. Unfortunately it\u2019s not quite as great as it sounds. Especially if you were imagining it would apply to popular digital media streaming services like Spotify and Netflix . Nope, sorry.  Geoblocks for digital media are not being vanquished in this round of EU Digital Single Market regulation chess.  What is being agreed by EU lawmakers is an end to geoblocks for the sale of goods and services \u2014 just not if the electronic services in question happen to be stuff like, er, streaming music, TV, video and so on\u2026  Don\u2019t be fooled if a speaker says that we abolished #geoblocking, though. We didn\u2019t. Only for buying goods & services, but not for digital media like videos, games, ebooks. Progress is slow. https://t.co/T9LnFEul1y \u2014 Julia Reda (@Senficon) February 5, 2018  A crumb of comfort on that front is last year agreement was reached among EU institutions on new rules around the portability of digital content for travelers \u2014 meaning that from this year EU citizens traveling across the 28 Member State bloc can now access the online media services which they have already subscribed to when they are on holiday in another EU country.  But if you want to actually subscribe to \u2014 and continuously consume \u2014 those sorts of audio-visual digital services across EU borders, well, you\u2019re going to be out of luck. Copyright being the major blocker here.  What does this mean in practice? Well, EU geoblocks are certainly alive and well if you try to sign up to \u2014 for example \u2014 Netflix from a different Member State to the EU country where you live (or where your bank cards were issued).  Or even if you attempt to buy a Spotify gift card for a person who lives in a different EU country to the country you do.  The digital service providers will simply deny these kind of transactions \u2014 and the notion of an EU \u2018digital single market\u2019 will be shown up as rather more aspiration than actual at this point. Nor is that situation going to change this year.  The Commission does know this \u2014 because it\u2019s at least making an attempt to address the regulatory dissonance. In September 2016 it proposed additional EU legislation aimed at facilitating the provision of cross-border audiovisual services.  But an EC spokeswoman confirmed to us that those provisions remain under negotiation.  And, as MEP Julia Reda tweeted yesterday, progress is slow. The progress-blocking culprit? Take a bow Hollywood et al\u2026  That\u2019s why we will still vote in favour. It\u2019s important to note though that also the Parliament position would have left copyright and licensing regimes completely intact. It\u2019s just excluded because nobody wants to fight the powerful entertainment industry. \u2014 Julia Reda (@Senficon) February 5, 2018  In a 2016 impact assessment document attached to the Commission\u2019s proposal \u2014 and specifically discussing the licensing of video on demand rights \u2014 the EC wrote that its preferred option \u201cincludes a European stakeholders\u2019 dialogue and a negotiation mechanism that would facilitate the conclusion of licences for the online exploitation of audiovisual works by removing contractual blockages\u201d.  Which is a long-winded way of saying they need to get the entertainment industry to agree to cross-border licensing. So, frankly speaking, I wouldn\u2019t hold your breath for the arrival of that truly seamless digital single market dream.  The EC\u2019s VP for the # DigitalSingleMarket recognized the problem in comments made at a plenary meeting yesterday \u2014 saying it intends to pay \u201cparticular attention\u201d to the \u201cnon-audio visual copyright protected services like software, games, e-books and music\u201d, and admitting the current regulation only partially covers this sort of digital content.  His comments also confirm that services like Netflix represent the hardest digital content cross-border portability problem to fix. (Even \u2014 and here\u2019s the consumer kicker \u2014 as they\u2019re likely to be the kind of services EU citizens really do want \u2018seamless\u2019 access to\u2026 )  What about #geoblocking of content protected by #copyright?  \u27a1\ufe0fWe'll review the scope of #geoblocking rules 2 years after entry into force  \u27a1\ufe0fI urge MEPs & Member States to agree on #satcab rules on cross-border access to audiovisual content online & keep level of ambition pic.twitter.com/AwMSi6cPxY \u2014 Andrus Ansip (@Ansip_EU) February 6, 2018  So, for the circa 20 million EU citizens the EC says were born in a different EU Member State from the one where they live now, there will be around three years\u2019 wait before the Commission is even going to take a closer look at the kind of geoblocks they\u2019re still being saddled with.  And the Christmas 2018 consolation prize of a partial end to geoblocks is just that: A piecemeal offer that doesn\u2019t change much.  Instead of seamless cross-border access to popular streaming media services this year, EU citizens might be able to shop online for physical goods from another EU Member State which they then have to go and pick up themselves (or arrange their own shipping).  They may also be able to purchase an electronic service like web hosting from another Member State without having to pay any additional fees (though not necessarily obtaining the service at the same price).  And they could perhaps be able to purchase a service provided in a specific physical location without being redirected to a local website to do so.  All thanks to the Commission\u2019s \u2018unjustified geoblocks\u2019 regulation. (\u2018Might\u2019, \u2018may\u2019 and \u2018could\u2019 because the EC notes the regulation does not impose an obligation on companies to sell. Nor does it harmonise prices, as noted above.)  The point of this piecemeal regulation, says the EC, is to address discrimination in access to goods and services \u201cin cases where it cannot be objectively justified (e.g. by VAT obligations or different legal requirements)\u201d.  It\u2019s just a shame it\u2019s the Commission has failed to embrace a meaningful reform of digital copyright rules across the bloc.

The changes are notable in light of Disney\u2019s planned entry in the streaming market in 2019, when it will launch a Netflix competitor, specifically aimed at families, and lacking R-rated content.  Netflix already offers a fairly robust set of parental controls, which followed the company\u2019s decision to focus more on kids, with launch of its \u201cKids\u201d user interface back in 2011. In addition to setting up individual profiles for each Netflix user in a household, parents could also set PIN controls for all content at a given maturity level. For example, anything rated \u201cAdults\u201d (R, NC-17, NR, UR) could be set to require a PIN code in order to view it.  Now, Netflix is adding the option to set PIN codes by individual movies and series, to give parents more control over specific items.  This decision may have been inspired by the controversy surrounding Netflix\u2019s series, \u201c13 Reasons Why,\u201d which tackled issues like sexual assault and suicide. While some parents believed the series helped them have difficult conversations with their teens about these important topics, other parents (and some mental health experts) said it glorified suicide, and was \u201cdangerous.\u201d  This series is precisely the sort of thing parents want to choose if (or when) their children watch; and they\u2019d like to make that decision without necessarily having to set system-wide PIN controls.  In addition to the new PIN option, Netflix says it will also now display the maturity level rating for a series or film once the title begins to play. This will appear at the top-left corner, and will bring increased visibility to the content\u2019s intended audience and why it received that rating (e.g. language, sexual content, etc.).  Ratings have become even more helpful in the streaming era, when so much new content is released on a regular basis, much of its originals, all of which is available in one destination \u2013 the streaming service itself. In the cable era, kids content would generally be found on its own channel, which made knowing what\u2019s appropriate a lot easier.  Netflix says it\u2019s also exploring other ways to make information about ratings more descriptive and easier for users to understand at a glance \u2013 which could signal more user interface tweaks are still ahead.

This Gravity meets Event Horizon flick mashes up the scariest things outside our planet to provide an answer. A new Netflix original film, \u201cThe Cloverfield Paradox,\u201d is now available after a surprise announcement during the Super Bowl. Producer J.J. Abrams is back for a third-installment that\u2019s tense and eerie, leaving you worrying how far director Julius Onah will push the frights.  The Cloverfield Paradox explores a world set to run out of energy in five years. A space station is created to test an experimental particle accelerator that could generate enough power to solve the crisis. But turning it on unleashes terrifying, reality-warping changes.  The film follows 2008\u2019s found monster footage collage Cloverfield, and 2016\u2019s 10 Cloverfield Lane, where survivors end up losing their minds in a shelter. But while those films felt zoomed into a tight set of characters, The Cloverfield Paradox encompasses a whole earth on the brink of panic.  Trapped on the space station, the film does meander a bit, but the spooky occurrences it pursues add to the film\u2019s overwhelming atmosphere of disorientation. It never fully forges a connection between the audience and many of the characters, though star Gugu Mbatha-Raw handles intense emotional weight as a grieving crew member.  Those looking to geek out on the science of global warming worst case scenarios will find The Cloverfield Paradox tantalizing. There are a few unresolved phenomena that are unnecessary, but it\u2019s powerful to see the crew crack under the pressure of a world looking to be saved.  The Cloverfield Paradox stumbles trying to cram climactic action into its claustrophobic quarters. This isn\u2019t an action blockbuster by any means. But an entertaining ending makes you want another film in the series back on the ground.  Netflix has managed to launch both a passable one-off, and a movie that keep Abrams fans subscribed until they can get another Cloverfield fix.

You do start to wonder about how quality can be maintained when you\u2019re aiming for that much original programming in that span of time.

Squeezed by Facebook and Google on one side, and impossible consumer expectations created by Netflix, Amazon and other streaming services on the other, the idea of an ad-supported entertainment business is under siege.  This chart from the analyst firm MoffettNathanson shows just how grim the situation is for companies not named Google or Facebook.  But in a wide-ranging conversation at the Code Media conference in Huntington Beach, Calif., the top executives of Turner and A+E Networks elaborated on how their app businesses and investments in startups are driving new growth.  While it\u2019s not a revelation that apps are a great way to make money and build a deeper relationship with consumers, and that technology is the future for networks (frankly the tech companies that have overrun Hollywood in the past few years are a stark example of this new reality), the success of Turner\u2019s Boomerang service and the investments that A+E has made in companies like Atlas Obscura and Vice highlight alternative ways to make money (I\u2019m also looking at you, Vox and Recode).  Turner launched Boomerang last year as a subscription service for cartoons in a joint venture between Cartoon Network and Warner Brothers. The app now counts roughly 150,000 subscribers, according to Turner chief executive John Martin. Martin also said the company was seeing success with its FilmStruck service, which leverages the Turner Classic Movies brand to offer a curated slate of movies to watch.  Martin said FilmStruck \u201cprovides a learning experience into what the future of this business is going to be, which is tapping into fandom.\u201d  For Martin, the idea of curation is going to be increasingly important as the amount of available distractions and stories explodes across different media properties. If the future of Turner is, as Martin says, \u201cbeing responsible for controlling the consumer experience from start to finish,\u201d then guiding people to apps where Turner can control that experience just makes sense.  Meanwhile, A+E has leveraged its investments in Atlas Obscura and Vice to provide new types of marketing dollars and open the network to an entirely new audience, according to chief executive Nancy Dubuc.  Dubuc pointed to the company\u2019s investment in Atlas Obscura as being a great way to move its audience from television at the History Channel, through Atlas Obscura to experiential marketing campaigns for a credit card company like American Express that would give benefits to new applicants.  Dubuc also said that Vice Media has been a success for the company. \u201cVice came to be around converting a channel so that you can reach a millennial audience,\u201d Dubuc said of the A+E decision to convert its H2 channel over to Viceland.  \u201cThey have the second most upscale audience to Bravo,\u201d Dubuc says of the Viceland channel. While the channel hasn\u2019t seen tremendous subscriber growth, it\u2019s reaching an audience of 18-34-year-old males with household incomes over $60,000, she said.  Those numbers will appeal to any marketer.  Nor are the two networks alone in looking to technology for returns. According to people with knowledge of the situation, that\u2019s one of the reasons why Fox bought TrueX four years ago \u2014 to improve the experience for consumers watching ads online.  \u201cPutting aside the investments in other companies, it\u2019s about having deep relationships with consumers however you get there,\u201d says one technology exec at a major studio. \u201cHaving an app on somebody\u2019s phone is perhaps the best way to get there\u2026 There\u2019s a fundamental thesis there.

It\u2019s hard to imagine Mr. Rock releasing a club set after hardly any time to refine it, the way Mr. Chappelle did over New Year\u2019s. Mr. Rock is too much of a perfectionist.

Whereas Mr. Chappelle escapes tricky territory through sweeping history lessons or literary flourishes, Mr. Rock builds forceful arguments that culminate in precise and memorable epigrams. \u201cPressure makes diamonds, not hugs\u201d is the pithiest defense of bullying you will hear.  Mr. Rock\u2019s booming act has always been built for bigger rooms, but he goes smaller for this special, with the help of the comic Bo Burnham, whose artfully idiosyncratic direction emphasizes intimacy and studiously avoids clich\u00e9. The show begins with a casual shot of the back of Mr. Rock\u2019s head while he is chatting backstage and ends abruptly. When the star drops the microphone, Mr. Burnham fades to black before we hear the familiar sound of it hitting the floor. Crisp images of the front row of the theater, juxtaposed with smoky backdrops and ghostly lighting, make the audience appear on the same level as the performer, creating unusually striking images for stand-up comedy.  In filming just the first joke \u2014 \u201cYou would think that cops would occasionally shoot a white kid, just to make it look good\u201d \u2014 Mr. Burnham shifts angles four times, but he also knows when to stop moving the camera. As Mr. Rock confesses he cheated on his wife, he goes in for the close-up and lingers.  This risks heavy-handedness but displays a perceptive eye for the importance of a pivot point where the star could lose his audience. Kevin Hart, who recently confessed to cheating on his wife before announcing a tour called \u201cIrresponsible,\u201d might face a similar onstage moment soon.  When I saw Mr. Rock play Madison Square Garden in December, he took a few glancing shots at Matt Lauer, the \u201cToday\u201d host who was fired over allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior, but the comic mostly avoided #MeToo as he does in the new special. Though Mr. Rock evoked the movement at one point by shifting from his mistakes with his wife to a broader question: \u201cWhat is wrong with men?\u201d  Over the course of his career, mixing the voice of a preacher with that of a litigator, Mr. Rock has built up an authority skewering the foibles of the world while keeping his own offstage. This special represents a shift in that dynamic. In describing his flaws, Mr. Rock says he was hooked on pornography. There is a lot of comedy about pornography, but to hear a superstar break down how watching it made him \u201csexually autistic\u201d is bracing, and may even provide grist to certain warnings against online porn.

His tone is contrite, but it also suggests he has recovered, both from porn addiction and cheating, which he says he\u2019s done with. In an hour dense with jokes, he gets serious. \u201cWhen guys cheat, we want something new,\u201d he says, still in close-up. \u201cBut you know what happens? Your woman finds out and now she\u2019s new. She\u2019s never the same again. You got new but you got a bad new.\u201d  Offstage, Chris Rock is soft-spoken, thoughtful, even shy \u2014 an alter ego to the strutting superhero he becomes in his stand-up specials whose titles (\u201cBigger & Blacker,\u201d \u201cNever Scared\u201d) telegraph swagger. In the age of Trump, he has shifted to something quieter, more humble, and yet, with the same old confidence, with lessons learned at the end.

Their characters become close friends and rely on each other for survival, which becomes a wonderful (nonromantic) relationship to watch.  \u2014  A scene from \u201cThe Iron Giant.\u201d Warner Bros.  \u2018The Iron Giant\u2019  Starts streaming: April 1  April 1 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Although the robotic star of this movie makes a big cameo in Steven Spielberg\u2019s \u201cReady Player One,\u201d his role in a fight scene in that film presents a sharp contrast with how audiences first met the gentle Iron Giant in 1999. In the original animated film, a boy named Hogarth finds the large robot from outer space during the paranoia-filled age of the Cold War. He is forced to keep his new best friend a secret even though the giant comes in peace. Unloved at the box office during its first run, \u201cThe Iron Giant\u201d later gained a devoted following and helped get its director, Brad Bird, into Pixar Studios, where he went on to make \u201cThe Incredibles.\u201d  \u2014  From left, Roberto Benigni, Giorgio Cantarini and Nicoletta Braschi in \u201cLife Is Beautiful.\u201d Sergio Strizzi/Miramax Films  \u2018Life Is Beautiful\u2019  Starts streaming: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  In this three-time Oscar-winner (one of which resulted in this moment), a Jewish Italian father tries to protect his young son from the horrors of a concentration camp after they are captured by Nazis.

It is delightfully \u201980s in every respect: the hair, the clothes, the kinds of mischief the kids get up to. And then there\u2019s the cast, which includes \u201980s stars like Corey Feldman, Corey Haim, Alex Winter, Dianne Wiest and Kiefer Sutherland, as the leader of the vampire pack.  \u2014  Michelle Pfeiffer and Al Pacino in \u201cScarface.\u201d Universal Pictures, via Everett Collection  \u2018Scarface\u2019  Starts streaming: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  This is the Brian De Palma movie that launched a handful of catchphrases, many bad Al Pacino impressions and countless movie posters on dorm rooms across the country. Written by Oliver Stone, the film follows the ruthless Cuban gangster Tony Montana as he climbs his way up from being a low-level hood to ruling a slice of the Miami drug scene in the decadent \u201980s. In his perverted sense of the American dream, nothing is off limits. It\u2019s a mentality that eventually leads to so many scenes of violence and drug use that it makes \u201cMiami Vice\u201d look like a kid\u2019s show.  \u2014  Netflix Original TV Series  A scene from \u201cChef\u2019s Table: Pastry.\u201d Martin Westlake/Netflix  \u2018Chef\u2019s Table: Pastry\u2019  Starts streaming: April 13  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  TV\u2019s prettiest-looking cooking series gets its second spinoff, focused on four of the world\u2019s most acclaimed dessert-makers: the Milk Bar\u2019s Christina Tosi, Room 4\u2019s Will Goldfarb, El Celler de Can Roca\u2019s Jordi Roca and Caff\u00e8 Sicilia\u2019s Corrado Assenza.

Netflix\u2019s new remake appears to be keeping most of what worked the first time out, albeit with updated special effects and a more modern outlook on gender roles. The comically dour Dr. Smith, for example \u2014 played by Jonathan Harris in the original \u2014 is a woman in this version, and she\u2019s played by a cleverly cast Parker Posey.  \u2014  Robert F.

The four-hour docu-series \u201cBobby Kennedy for President\u201d is an effort to correct that imbalance, using the landmark cultural moment of Kennedy\u2019s 1968 White House run \u2014 and its abrupt, tragic end \u2014 as a lens through which to observe what he stood for and what he meant to a generation of young idealists.  \u2014  Also of interest: \u201cThe Boss Baby: Back in Business\u201d Season 1 (April 6), \u201cThe Magic School Bus Rides Again\u201d Season 2 (April 13), \u201cThe Chalet\u201d Season 1 (April 17), \u201cDope\u201d Season 2 (April 20).

Directed by Joshua Marston and written by Marcus Hinchey, the film is intended as a bracing challenge to fervent Christian believers, asking them to consider the true purpose of their faith.  \u2014  From left, Ed Harris, Elizabeth Olsen and Jason Sudeikis in \u201cKodachrome.\u201d Christos Kalohoridis/Netflix  \u2018Kodachrome\u2019  Starts streaming: April 20  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Based on a true story, the indie dramedy \u201cKodachrome\u201d stars Ed Harris as a cranky, ill old man who takes a road trip with his compassionate nurse (Elizabeth Olsen) and his estranged son (Jason Sudeikis), in order to drop off some undeveloped rolls of film at the last lab in the country that can process them. Similarities to the recent Oscar nominee \u201cNebraska\u201d are unmistakable, but this move has its own tone and rhythm, paying off in some satisfyingly emotional moments.  \u2014  0  A scene from \u201cMercury 13.\u201d via Netflix  \u2018Mercury 13\u2019  Starts streaming: April 20  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  In 1960, not long after NASA publicly announced the names of the seven pilots who became the first American men in space \u2014 the so-called Mercury Seven \u2014 a private organization started recruiting women to undergo some of the same psychological and physical tests administered to those men. The purpose: to see if the challenges of flying beyond Earth\u2019s atmosphere differed by gender. The documentary \u201cMercury 13\u201d is a look into this lesser-known project, considering the way the codified sexism of the post-World War II era denied a one-of-a-kind opportunity to some would-be (and perfectly capable) adventurers.  \u2014  Chris Rock, left, and Adam Sandler in \u201cThe Week Of.\u201d Netflix  \u2018The Week Of\u2019  Sarts streaming: April 27  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  For the most part, the movies that Adam Sandler has delivered to Netflix as part of his recent four-picture deal have been embarrassingly broad. But there\u2019s reason to hope that this last film in the batch will be the best \u2014 in part because it is directed by the incisive veteran comic Robert Smigel (who also wrote the film with Sandler), and in part because it also stars Sandler\u2019s old \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d castmate Chris Rock. Sandler and Rock play parents who spend an anxious seven days leading up to their kids\u2019 wedding.

In the not-too-distant future (1997 \u2014 the film was released in 1981), Air Force One crash lands in the prison colony of Manhattan, and Plissken is enlisted to rescue the president before the crooks who kidnapped him seek revenge. Along with \u201cThe Thing,\u201d this is one of the best 1980s collaborations between Russell and the movie\u2019s director, John Carpenter. Between Russell\u2019s gruff macho-man character, exaggerated villains and dystopian view of New York City, this movie is pretty out there. Breaking up all the seriousness, the classic-movie star Ernest Borgnine shows up for comic relief as an old-school cabdriver looking to help Plissken with his mission.  \u2014  Robert De Niro in \u201cThe King of Comedy.\u201d 20th Century Fox  \u2018The King of Comedy\u2019  Starts streaming: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  In his mind, Rupert Pupkin (Robert De Niro) is a TV star, and he\u2019ll do just about anything to make his dream come true \u2014 including stalking and kidnapping. This is perhaps one of Martin Scorsese\u2019s more understated movies. It doesn\u2019t have the same amount of violence that movies like \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d or \u201cGoodfellas\u201d have. It\u2019s a psychological drama that is tense and sometimes tragically funny.  \u2014  Michelle Pfeiffer and Alec Baldwin in \u201cMarried to the Mob.\u201d MGM  \u2018Married to the Mob\u2019  Starts streaming: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Angela de Marco (Michelle Pfeiffer) has a husband in the mafia (a young and dashing Alec Baldwin), and she wants out. Unfortunately, leaving the mob is harder than breaking a marriage, and Angela is left to defend for herself from gangsters and the feds. The premise sounds bleak, but \u201cMarried to the Mob\u201d is a lively Jonathan Demme romantic comedy that gives Pfeiffer a chance to play for laughs. It\u2019s funny but poignant, bubbly but still dark at times \u2014 all in equal measure so nothing is out of whack.  \u2014  A scene from \u201cParanormal Activity.\u201d Paramount Pictures  \u2018Paranormal Activity\u2019  Starts streaming: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  This is the low-budget found-footage horror film that helped kick off a craze in the late 2000s. Suspecting there\u2019s something strange lurking in their new home, a young couple sets up stationary cameras to capture whatever might be creeping around at night. But the cause of the disturbances is more terrifying than they anticipated. For best results, watch this movie at night, right before you go to bed.  \u2014  Sally Field, left, and Julia Roberts in \u201cSteel Magnolias.\u201d TriStar Pictures  \u2018Steel Magnolias\u2019  Starts streaming: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  This is both a great mother-daughter movie and a good one to watch with girlfriends. \u201cSteel Magnolias\u201d is about a group of women in the South and the many highs and lows of their collective experiences. The central story follows a hard-to-please mother (Sally Field) and her diabetic daughter (Julia Roberts), who despite her fragile health still wants kids. Field and Roberts are amazing, but there isn\u2019t a bad performer in a cast that includes Shirley MacLaine, Daryl Hannah, Olympia Dukakis and Dolly Parton in one of her best onscreen roles.  \u2014  Chavela Vargas as seen in \u201cChavela.\u201d Music Box Films  \u2018Chavela\u2019  Starts streaming: April 2  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  For those not familiar with the Mexican musician Chavela Vargas, let this inspiring documentary be your guide. She was a pants-wearing pioneer in an era when Mexican women didn\u2019t sing ranchera music onstage without wearing super frilly dresses. But Vargas ditched the costume, picked up a guitar and sang haunting songs of longing and loss. This documentary goes to great lengths to explain the mysterious Vargas through old interviews and recordings, but it can sometimes feel as if she\u2019s just out of reach. She\u2019s keeping some secrets to herself.  \u2014  0  From left, Christopher Rivera, Brooklynn Prince and Valeria Cotto in \u201cThe Florida Project.\u201d A24  \u2018The Florida Project\u2019  Starts streaming: April 6  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Sean Baker made a splash at Sundance a few years ago with \u201cTangerine,\u201d a sun-drenched, foul-mouthed comedy starring two transgender actresses and shot with an iPhone. His follow-up, \u201cThe Florida Project,\u201d is no less daring. Set amid a string of pastel-colored roadside motels in Orlando, Fla., just outside the Happiest Place on Earth, the movie follows a precocious 6-year-old troublemaker named Moonee (Brooklynn Prince) as she and her friends wreak havoc and her quick-tempered mother (Bria Vinaite) tries to keep up with the rent. Willem Dafoe gives a career-best performance as their motel\u2019s beleaguered manager, who becomes a kind of surrogate father to Moonee.  \u2014  Also of interest: \u201cBasic Instinct\u201d (April 1), \u201cCarrie\u201d (April 1), \u201cFor a Few Dollars More\u201d (April 1), \u201cFriday the 13th\u201d (April 1), \u201cThe Karate Kid\u201d (April 1), \u201cMarathon Man\u201d (April 1), \u201cMystic River\u201d (April 1), \u201cPhiladelphia\u201d (April 1), \u201cProject Nim\u201d (April 1) and \u201cSpaceballs\u201d (April 1).

In it, Cage plays a convict and former soldier who is on his way out of jail when the plane he is on gets hijacked by his fellow inmates. Of course, it wouldn\u2019t be a \u201990s Cage action movie without lots of fighting, over-the-top explosions and some pithy one-liners.  \u2014  Meryl Streep in \u201cDeath Becomes Her.\u201d Mary Evans/Universal Pictures, via Everett Collection  \u2018Death Becomes Her\u2019  Starts streaming: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Meryl Streep is at her funniest in this little black comedy about jealousy and magic. In it, Streep plays Madeline, a gorgeous movie star who steals the handsome fianc\u00e9 (Bruce Willis) of the much plainer Helen (Goldie Hawn), thus setting a disastrous course for both women. Their jealousy drives them to dark magic, which has some interesting physical side effects. \u201cDeath Becomes Her\u201d has a lighthearted, macabre sense of humor, full of morbid slapstick stunts and neck-twisting pratfalls. But it is also a bittersweet comedy about female friendships and impossible beauty standards.  \u2014  From left, Omar Sharif and Peter O\u2019Toole in \u201cLawrence of Arabia.\u201d Columbia Pictures  \u2018Lawrence of Arabia\u2019  Starts streaming: April 1  April 1 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  This 1962 war epic from director David Lean is on a lot of \u201cbest movies\u201d lists \u2014 and with good reason. The film is among the best of its genre, with its sweeping views of windswept battlegrounds and its penetrating look into the ways that war drives men mad. It\u2019s the story of T.E. Lawrence, who during World War I goes from being an insubordinate officer to a troubled leader. \u201cLawrence of Arabia\u201d is celebrated for Lean\u2019s stunning direction, for Maurice Jarre\u2019s unforgettable score, for Anne V. Coates\u2019s brilliant editing and for its remarkable cast, which includes Peter O\u2019Toole, Omar Sharif, Alec Guinness and Claude Raines. Don\u2019t let the three-and-a-half-hour run time scare you off.

But it isn\u2019t. As Polley peels back the layers of her own family\u2019s history, there\u2019s a kind of \u201cRashomon\u201d effect that happens as old family myths unravel and stories shift perspective. What results is a touching and breathtaking investigation into ideas of family, narrative and memory.  \u2014  Also of interest: \u201cCarrie\u201d (April 1), \u201cFor a Few Dollars More\u201d (April 1), \u201cFriday the 13th\u201d (April 1), \u201cMarried to the Mob\u201d (April 1), \u201cParanormal Activity\u201d (April 1), \u201cProject Nim\u201d (April 1), \u201cSpaceballs\u201d (April 1), \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d (April 1), \u201cLife is Beautiful\u201d (April 15) and \u201cLoving Vincent\u201d (April 19).

The chauvinist boss to the characters played by Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton is one of the worst onscreen employers in moviedom. After so many degrading incidents, the women get their righteous revenge on him, serving him a well-overdue comeuppance. The three women are wonderful together, and \u201cGrace and Frankie\u201d fans will really get a kick out of seeing an early pairing of Tomlin and Fonda.  \u2014  0  Harvey Stephens in \u201cThe Omen.\u201d 20th Century Fox  \u2018The Omen\u2019  Starts streaming: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  There are certain movies that make you happy that you don\u2019t have kids.

There are sequels, of course, but nothing gets quite as unnerving as watching the original Son of Satan scare the daylights out of Peck.  \u2014  From left, Lew Temple, Keri Russell and Cheryl Hines in \u201cWaitress.\u201d Alan Markfield/Fox Searchlight  \u2018Waitress\u2019  Starts streaming: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Written and directed by Adrienne Shelly, \u201cWaitress\u201d is a comedy-drama about a young mom-to-be (Keri Russell) who wants out of her small town and her loveless marriage.

The premise sounds a little cheesy, but Russell is endearing in her role and carries the story well.

Thus truly began a long-promised deluge of what the kids call \u201ccontent,\u201d and just how much original content Netflix will put up before the year is over is something not even Netflix can say.  The influx of original programs coincides with news reports about Netflix\u2019s thorny relationship with cinema. The Cannes Film Festival, making good on a pledge last year, has codified its ban on Netflix-produced films in its competition. (If it\u2019s a Netflix movie, it will not screen in competition.) This is because of what Cannes regards as Netflix\u2019s intransigence about showing its films in theaters. Add to that a recent interview with the director Steven Spielberg in which he said that films produced by Netflix and other streaming platforms ought not to be eligible for Oscar consideration but compete for the Emmy Awards instead. That brings the immortal question \u201cWhat Is Cinema?\u201d to the forefront yet again. Along with it are the debates over the ostensibly sacrosanct value of the Communal Theatrical Experience.  It\u2019s not this column\u2019s job to provide definitive answers to the questions these debates raise.

It\u2019s a peculiar grab bag of ideas and visual modes, and Mr. Jones has said it was influenced by his impressions of Berlin during his childhood, when he spent time there with his father, David Bowie, in the \u201970s.

Last season we shot in the winter, and it got darker in many ways. And now in Season 5, even more than in 4, it\u2019s very much more serialized and intense, while still obviously maintaining comedy first. It goes deeper than we ever have in the friendship.  Amy Poehler is an executive producer of the show. And until this coming season, so was her manager, Dave Becky, who has been criticized for ignoring sexual misconduct allegations against his client Louis C.K.  It just didn\u2019t feel right to have his name on a show that represents the exact opposite of what was going on with Louis.  Do you have your own #MeToo moment?  I don\u2019t have a major story particularly to tell, but there are so many stories within my story. The world of comedy is definitely a boys\u2019 club.

But it is a kind of alternative TV dimension, overlaying and replicating the known world of traditional television, that tries to acquire one of everything that exists in the universe of TV.  Initially, the company did this through literal acquisition: buying streaming rights to hit TV series. Then it did it through imitation: reviving Fox\u2019s \u201cArrested Development\u201d and creating originals, like \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d in the mold of premium cable. Now it\u2019s imitating through acquisition, spiriting away the likes of Mr. Murphy and Ms. Rhimes to its well-remunerated plane.  The history of TV is one of upstarts and competitors, and my first instinct was to liken Netflix to something like cable, which rose as a serious competitor to broadcast TV in the 1980s.  But there\u2019s an important difference between cable channels and Netflix (besides whom you write your check to). Cable channels have brands. That was what made them different from broadcast networks, which tried to be, and had to be, everything. Cable channels had specialties and sensibilities: CNN was news; ESPN was sports; HBO was adult sophistication (give or take an \u201cEntourage\u201d).  Photo  A cable brand might evolve \u2014 Bravo went from an arts channel to the \u201cReal Housewives\u201d channel \u2014 but the idea was to offer a specific aesthetic to a specific audience.  Netflix doesn\u2019t have that; in fact, it is specifically anti-that. Its brand is \u201cstuff that you like to watch on TV.\u201d It developed a vast library of reruns, and with that, a proprietary trove of data on who likes to watch what and how much. Then it made more of that, or bought it. If you liked \u201c30 Rock,\u201d here\u2019s \u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.\u201d If you liked \u201cDamages,\u201d here\u2019s \u201cBloodline.\u201d  Look at just the past few months of Netflix programming.

The obvious analogy, then, is that Netflix isn\u2019t cable at all; it\u2019s a broadcaster, pitching a big tent.  But, as I\u2019ve written before, there\u2019s one very important difference. Broadcasters, whose advertising model required millions of eyeballs on every individual show, had to make sure that everything they aired appealed to a broad range of people.  That business imperative had aesthetic results: It gave us family sitcoms and comfort-food cop dramas. It\u2019s less true today, in the era of smaller audiences \u2014 but it\u2019s still much more true of NBC than, say, of IFC.

It\u2019s selling a platform to everyone, but by providing products for very specific tastes.  Netflix assumes a future in which we\u2019re watching our faves on our own screens, rather than gathering around an electronic fireplace \u2014 and as long as the monthly payment clears, it\u2019s all the same to the company. It\u2019s less a big tent than a Dothraki tent city, to borrow a metaphor from \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d  What does this mean for Ryan Murphy and Shonda Rhimes? Maybe not much at all. They were both powerful producers with a lot of freedom who will now have a lot of freedom and more money.  Photo  Mr. Murphy was, in a way, the Netflix-iest of producers to begin with: He\u2019d made everything from a broadcast network sitcom (\u201cThe New Normal\u201d) to an action show (\u201c9-1-1\u201d) to a marquee cable drama (\u201cFeud\u201d) to an HBO film (\u201cThe Normal Heart\u201d). He may be able to branch out even more, but he was hardly fettered.  What Ms. Rhimes does at Netflix will be interesting. She\u2019s the consummate network TV producer, having essentially defined the current voice of ABC with \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d and \u201cScandal.\u201d  She might do something very different with the license of streaming \u2014 but if she doesn\u2019t, that will fit in all the same at Netflix, which resurrected the broadcast favorite \u201cGilmore Girls\u201d with much the same tone, give or take a few curse words. One curious thing about Netflix is that every sensibility \u2014 niche and mass, G-rated and NSFW \u2014 exists on the same platform and the same plane.

Whether Netflix is emptying its deep pockets wisely by making itself into a Hall of Fame for established stars (see also Dave Chappelle) isn\u2019t my concern as a TV critic.  What I do care about is whether Netflix can nurture original, distinctive art, especially if it continues growing into a huge, all-encompassing alterna-TV.  And I worry whether it can do that when derivation is the business strategy itself: selling people new versions of things they already like. It\u2019s fine that Netflix can toss around enough money to reactivate David Letterman. But does it have the kind of culture that could discover a new David Letterman?  In its short life as an original programmer. Netflix has made a few series I\u2019d consider legitimately great. But most of them have involved making deals with creators with limited track records (\u201cBoJack Horseman,\u201d \u201cAmerican Vandal\u201d) or talented artists relatively new to creating series (\u201cMaster of None,\u201d \u201cLady Dynamite\u201d). (As I\u2019ve also written before, these shows tend to be comedies, which may translate more directly and easily to the streaming format.)  A more familiar experience on Netflix is the good-enough version of a drama you\u2019ve seen elsewhere. \u201cGodless,\u201d say, was a perfectly decent dark western, but no \u201cDeadwood.\u201d \u201cStranger Things\u201d is a joy, but it\u2019s a pastiche by design: It\u2019s the Netflix ethos in story form, reproducing and remixing memories in ways that tickle just the right nostalgia pleasure centers.  It may be that Netflix\u2019s approach means more competence and fewer out-and-out stinkers. And I have no reason to believe that Mr. Murphy and Ms. Rhimes will become any less creative because Netflix backed up a money truck.  But if Netflix is truly becoming a parallel TV universe, I hope its algorithm finds room for the experimental and untried.

It suggests that if a viewer is struggling with these issues, he or she may want to avoid the show or watch it with a trusted adult.

The restaurant visits and chef interviews are broken up with fake commercials, animations, film clips and parodies of Japanese TV comedies or the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d Julia-Child-bleeds-out skit. The season finale is structured as a debate between Mr. Chang and the chef Mario Carbone over the relative merits of Italian filled pastas and Asian dumplings.  These techniques, and a generous Netflix budget, are on display in the pizza episode, which was filmed in Brooklyn, Tokyo, New Haven, Copenhagen, Naples, Los Angeles and Las Vegas. Demonstrating his trademark contrarianism, Mr. Chang praises Domino\u2019s \u2014 even donning the company vest and delivering pies \u2014 and declares New Haven and then Tokyo as the homes of the world\u2019s best pizza.  The visual curlicues and the attempts to impose a larger thematic structure and narrative \u2014 there\u2019s an awful lot of tired talk about how food tells stories \u2014 don\u2019t hide the reality that there isn\u2019t a whole lot new or surprising about \u201cUgly Delicious.\u201d (The exception: the openness with which it discusses racism as a fundamental force in culinary culture.) Its primary influence, as with other food shows, will probably be to max out reservations at impossibly cool-looking restaurants like the Tokyo pizzeria Seirinkan or the locavorish Salare in Seattle.  What the show is really selling is the Chang attitude and mystique, a combination of ego, exactitude, foul-mouthed rebelliousness and self-deprecatory nerdiness. With the opening of Momofuku Noodle Bar 14 years ago, he fortuitously caught the waves of both millennial casualness and fangirl-fanboy-style fetishization (of ingredients, of methods, of chefs) that swept through the restaurant business.

View all New York Times newsletters.  An important part of Mr. Chang\u2019s persona at the start was his outsider status, casting stones at (or at least making withering remarks about) the bastions of haute cuisine where he had learned his trade. That became problematic as he built an international restaurant empire that recently added the 200-plus-seat Momofuku Las Vegas.  And in \u201cUgly Delicious\u201d he moves with a band of insiders that includes Mr. Meehan, the superstar Danish chef Ren\u00e9 Redzepi and Mr. Ansari, Mr. Chang\u2019s fellow Netflix star. It\u2019s also a boy\u2019s club. An episode about home cooking is the only one with an equal representation of women and men among the significant speaking roles. In all the others men outnumber women by 2 or 3 to 1; in the pizza episode it\u2019s 8 to 1. This may reflect the state of affairs in the food industry, but it\u2019s surprising for a series that wants to talk about diversity and representation.  (African-American chefs and commentators are even less present, appearing almost exclusively in an episode about the coded meanings and cultural signifiers of fried chicken.)  The show often allows Mr. Chang\u2019s rough edges to show, and sometimes its picture of him is unflattering in ways that don\u2019t seem intentional. His jibes can cross over into meanness, and his pontifications can appear oblivious, as when he compares the art of barbecue to the art of jazz in an episode focused entirely on white and Asian cooks.  \u201cI don\u2019t know how the hell it all happened,\u201d Mr. Chang says, contemplating the franchise that he has become. The claim seems unlikely, and one way to see the show, with its focus on pizza and tacos and dumplings, is as a branding exercise \u2014 a pivot away from high-intensity cooking toward the ugly deliciousness of comfort food. The penultimate episode ends with him holding a plate of kimchi and Spam fried rice toward the camera. In the Chang vernacular, it looks bonkers, and you\u2019ll want to crush it.", "stock": "NFLX"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/23/watching/leaving-netflix-tv-shows-movies-march.html", "label": 1, "source": "the-new-york-times", "date": "2018-02-23", "article": "Watching is The New York Times\u2019s TV and film recommendation website.

A scene from \u201cJaws.\u201d Universal Pictures  \u2018Jaws\u2019  Leaving Netflix: March 1  : March 1 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  This 1975 horror thriller from Steven Spielberg did nothing less than revolutionize the movie industry \u2014 once studio executives realized exactly how much money could be made by a single summer blockbuster, it changed the way movies were released and advertised. But that\u2019s not the reason to see it (or see it again); it was a hit then, and it has endured for more than four decades because it is a masterfully constructed adventure ride, filled with bruising set pieces, eerily convincing effects, quotable dialogue (they are, in fact, gonna need a bigger boat), and memorable characters. Ultimately, we care about this ragtag crew of would-be shark hunters, which renders their breathless encounters with the great white all them more compelling.  \u2014  Guy Pearce in \u201cMemento.\u201d Danny Rothenberg/Newmarket Films  \u2018Memento\u2019  Leaving Netflix: March 1  : March 1 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Christopher Nolan\u2019s second feature \u2014 and first big hit \u2014 is an expertly constructed windup toy of a movie, spinning an exhilarating 113 minutes out of a fairly simple premise: A man with short-term memory loss (Guy Pearce), tries to solve his wife\u2019s murder. But Nolan augments the storytelling with an appropriate stylistic flourish, presenting it in reverse chronological order, so that in each new scene, the viewer is as uncertain about what\u2019s happening as the protagonist. Replete with neo-noir styling and a cast of top-notch character actors (including Joe Pantoliano, Carrie-Anne Moss, and Stephen Tobolowsky), \u201cMemento\u201d is a deliciously inventive mystery with a potent dose of melancholy right under its surface.  \u2014  Kitty Winn and Al Pacino in \u201cThe Panic in Needle Park.\u201d 20th Century Fox  \u2018The Panic in Needle Park\u2019  Leaving Netflix: March 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Before \u201cSerpico,\u201d before \u201cDog Day Afternoon,\u201d before even \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d Al Pacino made his big-screen breakthrough in this 1971 drug drama from director Jerry Schatzberg (\u201cStreet Smart\u201d). As a heroin addict and street hustler whose nights and days are an endless search for money, drugs or both, Pacino is both scarily convincing and offhandedly charismatic; you get a sense of why his new girlfriend, Helen (Kitty Winn, also terrific), would fall for him, and also why she should stay far away. Joan Didion and John Gregory Dunne\u2019s low-to-the-ground script and Schatzberg\u2019s gritty, neorealist-inspired photography create scenes that feel less written and staged than overheard and captured, resulting in an uncomfortable but powerful viewing experience.  \u2014  Natasha Lyonne in \u201cSlums of Beverly Hills.\u201d Fox Searchlight Pictures  \u2018The Slums of Beverly Hills\u2019  Leaving Netflix: March 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  American comedies don\u2019t deal in matters of class nearly as much as they could (and should), which is part of what makes this 1998 comedy from the writer-director Tamara Jenkins (\u201cThe Savages\u201d) unique, and valuable. Set in 1976, it concerns a lower-income family\u2019s attempts to keep the kids in good schools by dwelling in sketchy apartments right on the edge of Beverly Hills. Alan Arkin is a marvel as the hyper-neurotic patriarch, and David Krumholtz is uproariously funny as the unreasonably confident older son. But the showcase performer is Natasha Lyonne, warm and winning as the teenager daughter in the midst of a poorly-timed sexual awakening.  \u2014  0  A scene from \u201cThe Craft.\u201d Columbia Pictures  \u2018The Craft\u2019  Leaving Netflix: March 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Misfits and weirdos will love this 1996 supernatural thriller-drama, in which a nervous new girl (Robin Tunney) at a Catholic boarding school turns to a trio of outcasts (Neve Campbell, Fairuza Balk and Rachel True) for friendship, and their tight-knit group turns into a witches\u2019 coven. The witty script (by Peter Filardi and director Andrew Fleming) nicely quenches one\u2019s thirst for teenage vengeance, with all the proper parties getting their deserved comeuppance. But it\u2019s not just a gimmick movie; all four protagonists create distinctive characters of genuine depth, lending weight to what could have been a throwaway genre exercise.  \u2014  Eva Mendes and Will Smith in \u201cHitch.\u201d Columbia Pictures  \u2018Hitch\u2019  Leaving Netflix: March 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Between \u201cIndependence Day,\u201d \u201cMen in Black\u201d and \u201cI Am Legend,\u201d Will Smith got so good at saving the world, he rarely got the chance to flex his considerable romantic charm. This 2005 hit filled that niche a bit, casting Smith as a relationship expert and one-on-one date coach whose latest client (a sweet and likable Kevin James) is something of a challenge \u2014 one that arrives just as he meets (and finds himself atypically tongue-tied around) the woman of his own dreams (Eva Mendes). Director Andy Tennant mines plenty of laughs from Smith\u2019s built-in swagger and James\u2019s customary oafishness, and he also has a great time turning those personas inside out. Smith and Mendes generate real chemistry, provoking a genuine rooting interest in the midst of this lightweight romp.  \u2014  Marlon Brando in \u201cThe Chase.\u201d Horizon Pictures  \u2018The Chase\u2019  Leaving Netflix: March 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  A knockout ensemble cast \u2014 including Marlon Brando, Jane Fonda, Robert Redford, Robert Duvall and Angie Dickinson \u2014 assembles for this swampy, boozy, atmospheric thriller, in which a small town is rocked by a prison escape that unlocks their secret affairs, desires and lesser instincts. The pacing is a little punchy and the proceedings are a tad overheated, but it\u2019s worth a watch for the skill of the performers (Brando is particularly strong as a sheriff who\u2019s rapidly approaching the end of his rope) and for the inventive direction of Arthur Penn, whom we see tinkering with some of the thematic and stylistic interests he harvested to greater effect for his next film, \u201cBonnie and Clyde.\u201d  \u2014  Mireille Enos and Joel Kinnaman, right, in \u201cThe Killing.\u201d Chris Large/AMC  \u2018The Killing\u2019 (Seasons 1-2)  Leaving Netflix: March 13  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Normally, the removal of the first two seasons of a mystery serial would be a real bummer. But this four-season crime drama is something of an exception, as the split between Season 2 and Season 3 signaled the end of one story (and the end of an era, changing out all but two of the key cast members, which happened again for the fourth) and the beginning of the next. The first two years of the series, based on the Danish crime show \u201cForbrydelsen,\u201d tell a story about the murder of a Seattle teen in meticulous detail \u2014 each episode covers just 24 hours of the investigation. Taut and disturbing, intricate and moody, \u201cThe Killing\u201d is the kind of meaty crime drama that sticks to your ribs.  \u2014  Clockwise from top left: Cyril Figgis, Krieger, Cheryl, Pam Poovey, Sterling Archer and Ray Gillette in \u201cArcher.\u201d FX  \u2018Archer\u2019 (Seasons 1-7)  Leaving Netflix: March 14  : March 14 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  When it began in 2009, this animated FX comedy from Adam Reed sounded like a one-joke premise, and not exactly a fresh one either: an extended spoof on James Bond-style spy stories, set at a secret intelligence agency during an indeterminate and anachronistic pseudo-Cold War period. And yet it took flight (eight seasons and counting) thanks to the show\u2019s frisky writing, winking self-awareness, willingness to reboot itself entirely (full seasons have reset the narrative as a \u201cMiami Vice\u201d spoof and a private eye yarn), and most of all, the skills of the uproarious voice cast, including the \u201cArrested Development\u201d star Jessica Walters as another unstable mother and the \u201cBob\u2019s Burgers\u201d gem H. Jon Benjamin as the boozing, womanizing title character.  \u2014  From left, Judy Hopps (voiced by Ms. Goodwin) and Nick Wilde (voiced by Jason Bateman) in \u201cZootopia.\u201d Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures  \u2018Zootopia\u2019  Leaving Netflix: March 20  : March 20 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  On the surface, there shouldn\u2019t be anything particularly revelatory about a Disney movie with cuddly talking animals. What\u2019s fresh and fascinating about this 2016 smash Byron Howard and Rich Moore, however, is the way it takes the conventions of those movies and injects them with a subtle dose of social commentary \u2014 without turning preachy or detracting from its surface pleasures. Ginnifer Goodwin is plucky and charming as Judy Hopps, a bunny cop in a utopian city who is drawn into a mysterious case wherein tame animals are reverting to their wilder instincts. Jason Bateman is a marvelous counterpoint as the con-artist fox who leads her into the city\u2019s criminal underworld, creating a buddy cop dynamic that recalls \u201c48 HRS.\u201d as much as \u201cBambi.\u201d  \u2014  From left, Roger Rabbit (voiced by Charles Fleischer) and Bob Hoskins in \u201cWho Framed Roger Rabbit.\u201d Walt Disney Studios  \u2018Who Framed Roger Rabbit\u2019  Leaving Netflix: March 24  : March 24 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  \u201cZootopia\u201d wasn\u2019t Disney\u2019s first tale about crime-solving anthropomorphic mammals in the big city. One of its biggest hits of the 1980s was this clever story about cartoon animals and cynical humans who exist together in 1940s Los Angeles, where the movie star Roger Rabbit is accused of murdering a local tycoon. He hires Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins), a hard-boiled private eye, to clear his name, and they embark on a hilarious investigation of the animated movie industry, with cameo appearances by iconic characters from not only the Disney stable but also those of Warner Brothers, Max Fleischer and Walter Lantz. It\u2019s a treat for movie buffs and cartoon aficionados. It\u2019s also an entertaining potboiler, dipping into the juicy, \u201cChinatown\u201d-like mysteries and scandals of postwar Hollywood.  \u2014  From left: Waris Ahluwalia, Michael Gambon, Anjelica Huston, Noah Taylor, Bud Cort, Bill Murray, Matthew Gray Gubler, Seu Jorge, Jeff Goldblum, Cate Blanchett, Willem DaFoe in \u201cThe Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou.\u201d Phlippe Antonello/Touchstone Pictures  0  \u2018The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou\u2019  Leaving Netflix: March 26  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Bill Murray stars as Steve Zissou, a Jacques Cousteau-style oceanographer and documentarian, in this frisky yet bittersweet comic drama from director Wes Anderson. Working for the first time with Noah Baumbach (\u201cThe Squid and the Whale,\u201d \u201cFrances Ha\u201d) as his co-writer, Anderson indulges in an absurdist streak that meshes nicely with the familial discord and dry wit of his previous pictures. He also marshals one of his most impressive casts to date, which includes Cate Blanchett, Willem Dafoe, Michael Gambon, Jeff Goldblum, Anjelica Huston and Owen Wilson, who is both touching and goofy as Zissou\u2019s estranged son.  \u2014  Interested in getting suggestions on what to watch?

Here are 11 great movies and TV shows leaving Netflix in April.  Tom Hanks in \u201cApollo 13.\u201d Universal Pictures  \u2018Apollo 13\u2019  Leaving Netflix: April 1  April 1 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  There\u2019s no greater testament to the skill and craft of this 1995 smash from Ron Howard than the fact that he manages to build (and sustain, for two-plus hours) tension and suspense around an event with a widely known outcome. That event is the Apollo 13 lunar mission in 1970, intended to be the third manned landing on the moon but aborted after a mechanical failure that put the lives of its three astronauts in jeopardy. Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon and Bill Paxton project credible professionalism in those roles, finding the proper, fleeting moments to let their understandable fear and frustration blast through; an Oscar-nominated Ed Harris is brilliant as the flight director on the ground, marshaling the minds tasked with bringing their boys home.  \u2014  Michael Keaton, left, and Jack Nicholson in \u201cBatman.\u201d Warner Bros., via Everett Collection  \u2018Batman\u2019 / \u2018Batman Returns\u2019  Leaving Netflix: April 1  Once upon a time, a big-budget, big-screen adaptation of a popular comic book was actually a big deal. But the attraction to Tim Burton\u2019s 1989 \u201cBatman\u201d wasn\u2019t just its subject, but its style: The Gothically-inclined Burton (\u201cBatman\u201d was released between \u201cBeetlejuice\u201d and \u201cEdward Scissorhands\u201d) followed the lead of the graphic novels by Frank Miller, eschewing the fizzy, cartoon-pop sensibility of the \u201960s television series (and its film spinoff) and crafting a decidedly darker take on the Dark Knight, casting Michael Keaton against type in the title role opposite a riveting (and scenery-chewing) Jack Nicholson as the Joker. It was so successful, Burton was given more even freedom on its 1992 follow-up, which takes Gotham into grimmer territory thanks to Danny DeVito\u2019s freakish take on the Penguin and Michelle Pfeiffer\u2019s sizzling turn as Catwoman.  \u2014  A scene from \u201cCaddyshack.\u201d Warner Bros.  \u2018Caddyshack\u2019  Leaving Netflix: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  One of the most quotable comedies of the modern era (\u201cCinderella story,\u201d \u201cBe the ball,\u201d \u201cSo I got that goin\u2019 for me, which is nice\u201d), this 1980 favorite from director Harold Ramis (\u201cGroundhog Day\u201d) often feels like channel surfing between several movies at once: a W.C. Fields-style personality comedy starring Rodney Dangerfield; a wiseguy, post-\u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 vehicle for Chevy Chase; a slapstick farce starring Bill Murray; and an earnest coming-of-age comedy-drama featuring Michael O\u2019Keefe. But the inconsistency and incongruity somehow mesh, due in part to the picture\u2019s spirit of cheerful, slobs-vs.-snobs anarchy, resulting in something akin to a coked-up Marx Brothers movie.  \u2014  A scene from \u201cCool Runnings.\u201d Buena Vista Pictures  \u2018Cool Runnings\u2019  Leaving Netflix: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  One of the highlights of the 1988 Winter Olympics (from a storytelling perspective, if not a sporting one) was the debut of the Jamaican national bobsled team, which quickly became a fan favorite for their clear discomfort with an event not exactly common to their tropical home. But it soon became a feel-good underdog story of teamwork in the face of adversity \u2014 in other words, ideal fodder for a big-screen dramatization by Disney. And what could have been a one-joke physical comedy play instead became a warmhearted \u201990s classic, thanks to the energetic direction by Jon Turteltaub (\u201cNational Treasure\u201d) and the charismatic turns by Doug E. Doug, Leon, Malik Yoba, and Rawle D. Lewis as the team members, and (in one of his final performances) the great John Candy as their coach.  \u2014  0  John Mulaney on \u201cJohn Mulaney: New in Town.\u201d Comedy Central  \u2018John Mulaney: New in Town\u2019  Leaving Netflix: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  This 2012 special from John Mulaney, the former \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d writer and stand-up comic extraordinaire, which originally aired on Comedy Central, was only his second such showcase, but he already showed an old-timer\u2019s mastery of the form. His deceptively simple persona, of a meek but good-hearted soul doing his very best to navigate a complicated world, proves durable and reliable as he explores dating, doctor\u2019s visits and basic social interactions. The show\u2019s funniest (if somewhat specialized) bit, however, may be his lengthy rumination on the pleasures of \u201cLaw & Order: Special Victims Unit\u201d and its resident skeptic, Ice-T.  \u2014  Alex Bailey/Fox Searchlight Pictures  \u2018Never Let Me Go\u2019  Leaving Netflix: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Kazuo Ishiguro\u2019s 2005 dystopian romance novel gets the big-screen treatment in this 2010 drama from director Mark Romanek (\u201cOne Hour Photo\u201d). Keira Knightley, Carey Mulligan and Andrew Garfield star as three students and occasional romantic partners who discover, in their teens, that all of them are clones \u2014 born and raised for the eventual harvesting of their organs. Screenwriter Alex Garland displays the thoughtful, chamber-music approach to science fiction of his subsequent \u201cEx Machina\u201d and \u201cAnnihilation\u201d (both of which he directed). Romanek, meanwhile, pulls off the neat trick of creating a cold, sterile world that is nonetheless infected by warmth and humanity \u2014 attributable in no small part to the skillful work of his crackerjack cast.  \u2014  Morgan Freeman in \u201cThe Shawshank Redemption.\u201d Columbia Pictures, via Everett Collection  \u2018The Shawshank Redemption\u2019  Leaving Netflix: April 1  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Removing this 1994 prison drama from Netflix probably won\u2019t dent its ubiquity \u2014 it\u2019s a regular topper of IMDb\u2019s Top 250 list and it seems to pop up on TNT or TBS on a near-weekly basis. But it still smarts not to have this cinematic comfort food a mouse-click away, as it features the quintessential Morgan Freeman performance (wise, calm, and narrating for clarity) and some of Tim Robbins\u2019 most complicated work (as a man who says little and reveals even less). Frank Darabont\u2019s patient filmmaking, in which a series of seemingly casual vignettes crescendo into an emotionally overwhelming climax, makes this a particularly re-watchable film, in which little throwaways and asides take on extra meaning upon second (and third, and tenth) viewings.  \u2014  David Bowie in \u201cThe Prestige.\u201d Touchstone Pictures  \u2018The Prestige\u2019  Leaving Netflix: April 21  April 21 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  Between his first and second cracks at Batman, director Christopher Nolan slid in this twisty, stylish exercise in sleight-of-hand moviemaking, as if to assure the fans of his breakthrough movie \u201cMemento\u201d that he was still up to his old tricks. This time around, the term \u201ctricks\u201d is literal: In \u201cThe Prestige,\u201d Nolan tells the story of two stage magicians in 1890s London, whose friendly rivalry first becomes fraught, then deadly. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale scheme and connive appropriately in the leading roles; a standout supporting cast includes Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall and David Bowie.  \u2014  Banksy in a scene from \u201cExit Through the Gift Shop.\u201d Paranoid Pictures  \u2018Exit Through the Gift Shop\u2019  Leaving Netflix: April 22  April 22 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  The enigmatic and eccentric street artist Banksy directs this Oscar-nominated 2010 documentary, in which he profiles the rise of Thierry Guetta, known by the street-art name \u201cMister Brainwash.\u201d Frisky and funny, it casts a cynical insider\u2019s eye on the art world, as well as on Banksy\u2019s place inside it \u2014 particularly in retrospect because of rumors that Guetta was, in fact, a creation of Banksy\u2019s and that the entire story is a made-up prank. The director (who never reveals his face in the film) has denied the rumors, but they lend an extra dimension to this film, in which everything (and perhaps everyone) could be a bluff.  \u2014  Mark Ruffalo and Keira Knightley in \u201cBegin Again.\u201d Andrew Schwartz/Weinstein Company  \u2018Begin Again\u2019  Leaving Netflix: April 27  Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like  The Irish writer and director John Carney revisited his microbudget, Oscar-winning indie sensation \u201cOnce\u201d with a well-financed, star-cast exploration of the same themes: the magnificence of pop music, the semi-romantic charge of collaboration and the power of a song to say what can\u2019t be put into words alone. Keira Knightley is charming (and believable) as a songwriter who finds an unexpected champion in a burned-out record executive (Mark Ruffalo). The musical numbers are stirring, and the dramatic beats land, but its best scene is its simplest: its two protagonists, wandering through New York City with their headphones, playing each other their favorite songs. Sweet but not saccharine, it is full of tiny moments of truth.  \u2014", "stock": "NFLX"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/07/arts/television/marvel-jessica-jones-review-netflix.html", "label": 1, "source": "the-new-york-times", "date": "2018-03-07", "article": "Photo  The plan to have every episode of the second season of Marvel and Netflix\u2019s \u201cJessica Jones\u201d directed by women was conceived a year before the Harvey Weinstein revelations. But now that season arrives like a presciently timed herald of the #MeToo-Time\u2019s Up revolution, with 13 female directors and 9 of 13 episodes written or co-written by women. For added emphasis, it begins streaming on Thursday, which is International Women\u2019s Day.  This concentration of female creators is unusual, of course, particularly for a high-profile, comic-book-based drama. But \u201cJessica Jones\u201d was already one of the more women-centric dramas around when its first season appeared more than two years ago.  Its creator and showrunner, Melissa Rosenberg of the \u201cTwilight\u201d movies, focused tightly on Jones (Krysten Ritter), a moody private eye who had super strength forced on her as a child, and a few other female characters: Trish Walker (Rachael Taylor), a talk-radio host who is Jones\u2019s only friend, and Jeri Hogarth (Carrie-Anne Moss), a ruthless lawyer who helps Jones when it aligns with her own agenda.  In the first five episodes of Season 2 (an atypically small number for Netflix to provide for review), that triumvirate is even more central to the plot. And their portrayals have taken on new shades. Already isolated \u2014 none has children or a spouse \u2014 they are defined even more than before by their pain and rage and their desperate efforts to assert control over their lives. Jones is an emotional cripple unable to confront her past; Hogarth\u2019s monomaniacal focus on her career leaves her unprepared to face mortality. The relatively well-adjusted Walker is an abuse victim and recovering addict who can\u2019t commit to a relationship.

We\u2019ve seen a powerful person\u2019s downward spiral play out in a room with multiple hookers, cocaine and embarrassing dancing, but that person usually isn\u2019t a woman. We\u2019ve seen protagonists whose bottled-up anger turns them sullen, violent and heedless of others, but they\u2019re usually men. We\u2019ve seen the heroes of mystery-thrillers worry about their investigations putting loved ones in danger, but heroines not so much. (Conversely, traditional roles are preserved in a plot element involving Walker\u2019s past as a child star that explicitly invokes #MeToo.)

But a clich\u00e9 is still a clich\u00e9, whether it\u2019s presented from a female or male point of view. And the early episodes of the season make a lot of room for fairly static character development, with proportionally less attention paid to the traditional genre pleasures, like atmosphere and action, which were central to the first season\u2019s invigorating noir-superhero synthesis. (The noir part of the equation is still present, but dimly, in Jones\u2019s occasional voice-overs and in a preponderance of detective work that\u2019s pretty basic and arbitrary, a step or two above Googling when it isn\u2019t simply Googling.)", "stock": "NFLX"}, {"url": "http://www.techradar.com/reviews/audio-visual/av-accessories/netflix-1289024/review", "label": 1, "source": "techradar", "date": "2018-01-24", "article": "Netflix is without a doubt the best streaming service in Australia. It's affordable and works flawlessly. It's easy to see why Netflix is the gold standard in streaming.  Streaming has taken off in a big way in Australia since the launch of Netflix and Stan in 2015, changing the way that Aussies approach entertainment consumption, while also paving the way for the likes of Foxtel Now.  If you're having trouble deciding on which streaming service to choose, we're here to make that decision as easy as possible for you.  Netflix has evolved quite a bit since its launch, having added more functionality and content to keep up with customer demands and the constant innovation seen in the smart TV market.  While all of the SVOD services in Australia have terrific content on offer, Netflix remains the undisputed king of streaming. Read our in depth review to find out why!  Cheapest stream around  Netflix Australia starts from $9.99 per month for the entry-level, single-stream standard definition package, all the way up to $17.99 for the deluxe, 4K quality, four-stream package.  While not everyone is going to be able to take advantage of 4K streaming quality, either due to the resolution capabilities of their TV set, or the bandwidth quality that's available to them, the package is unquestionably great value.  If you're worried about the kind of stream quality you're going to get from the service, never fear: you can try Netflix out with an obligation-free 30 day trial period.  While we can't really recommend the standard definition package to anyone who can help it, it is a nice option for those with poor-quality internet connections.  Most people will want to opt for the middle range package, giving customers access to two simultaneous streams of 1080p content for $13.99 a month.  Please note, If you plan to stream Netflix on an Xbox 360 or Xbox One, you'll need to have an Xbox Live account. That isn't a Netflix thing; it's a Microsoft thing, and it applies to Netflix's rivals, too.  There's also an added bonus for Optus and iiNet customers \u2013 Netflix usage is completely unmetered for those internet service providers.  Compatible devices  Though its competitors are slowly improving in terms of device compatibility, Netflix remains king, playable on just about everything.  Like Stan and Presto, Netflix can be viewed with the use of a Google Chromecast, Apple TV, iOS device, Android device, PC, Sony' PS4 and PS3 consoles, and a range of Smart TVs. Unlike those services, you can also watch Netflix on Microsoft's Xbox 360 and Xbox One, Nintendo's Wii U. It can also be watched on a range of set-top boxes and media players like Roku player and Fetch TV.  Though Netflix was previously viewable on WD TV Live media player devices, that functionality has since been patched out, with Western Digital choosing to focus on what it's good at \u2013 streaming content from your computer to your TV.  Speaking of Roku, Netflix is now also available on the Roku 2-powered Telstra TV streaming box, which. along with the PlayStation 3 and 4, can provide access to all three of Australia's major SVOD services.  It should be noted that not all devices can stream Netflix in 4K. This functionality depends on your 4K smart TV has an in-built Netflix app, or if you've got 4K-ready device, like the Xbox One S or Xbox One X, the PS4 Pro, an Ultra HD Blu-ray player, or the Fetch TV Mighty.  Netflix also offers some of its content in HDR and Dolby Vision, depending on your television supports the high dynamic range formats.  Setting up Netflix  Getting Netflix up and running is remarkably straightforward, and should be easy enough for even your tech-illiterate mum and dad to set up without any problems \u2013 simply create an account and use your login details to sign in to any of the devices listed above.  The signup process involves the usual entering of your details, moving on to choosing one of the three packages Netflix offers.  Because Netflix prides itself on its recommendation algorithm, you will be asked to pick three shows or films that you'd like to watch or know that you enjoy from a range of options.  Choose carefully, because these choices will form the foundation of your Netflix recommendations experiences for the foreseeable future.  While Netflix will continually tailor its recommendations for you based on what you actually watch, your initial choices will still be used to recommend you stuff years later.  Once you've created a profile, you can start adding shows and films to your Netflix 'My List'.  You can make multiple profiles, of course, so everyone in your household can get a personalised set of recommendations and keep their own queue of shows.  There's even a ready-made profile exclusively for kids, with all the inappropriate stuff filtered out.  The Netflix user experience  Those who've used an overseas Netflix service before can rest assured that Netflix Australia's interface is completely identical (aside from its content selection).  Those who are using Netflix for the first time shouldn't have any trouble navigating its user-friendly interface, which separates Netflix's content into a number of different genres and categories that you can swipe through to see what's on offer.  The shows and movies you've watched most recently are at the top of your Netflix screen, allowing you to jump right back in and continue watching, and following right after is the 'My List' category, giving you easy access to all of the shows you've queued up for later perusal.  From here, you'll get categories that show you what's currently popular on Netflix, the service's 'Top Picks' for you, which are based on 'thumbs up/thumbs down' ratings handed out by people with similar viewing habits to you. Eventually, genres and recommendations become more specific to your interests as you continue to watch different kinds of programmes and movies.  Admittedly, it can be annoying to have to scroll through several layers of categories to get to the sections you actually want to browse.  Rather than show you everything the service has on its front page, Netflix would rather maintain a level or mystery surrounding the size of its library, opting instead to give you a taste of what it has, and then keep springing new suggestions on you based on what you watch. If you do want to see everything the service has to offer, you'll need to visit each individual genre separately and scroll through its offerings.  Thankfully, it's been revealed that you can now unlock a huge number of oddly specific categories on the web version of Netflix by adding a numerical code to the end of a certain URL. The trick gives you access to such genres as 'Understated Movies based on real life' and 'Gory Italian Movies from the 1980s.  The constantly shifting nature of Netflix's suggestions gives the service the illusion of having more content than it actually does \u2013 it's like this in every territory.  Hop into a programme and either choose a specific episode from a specific season or continue from where you were last at \u2013 Netflix will always remember your spot.  Unlike Stan, Netflix gives you subtitle options on pretty much every single show in its range, as well as different language tracks where available \u2013 this is a huge win for the hearing impaired and those with a language barrier.  When it comes to actually watching content however, Netflix completely outclasses its competitors.  Even on a moderate broadband connection, our streams began almost immediately after hitting the play button \u2013 we only ever experienced two or three seconds of loading before the start of a show, and within ten seconds of it starting, Netflix's variable bit rate had already cleared the image up into a pristine, high-definition presentation.  That variable bit rate is the truly what makes Netflix so special, allowing the quality of your stream to seamlessly go up and down depending on your connection, rather than stopping your show dead in its tracks in order to buffer.  While watching Netflix through a VPN and Smart DNS has always been a fast and smooth experience, local Netflix feels even faster and smoother.  Best of all, Netflix has finally introduced offline viewing, meaning that users can now download certain TV shows and films to their iOS and Android apps. On top of this, it is now possible to use Netflix's offline viewing functionality in the Windows 10 PC app. It's worth noting that this will only work within the app \u2013 offline viewing is not available through your PC's browser.  This changes absolutely everything when it comes to enjoying Netflix, as subscribers can now use the app outside of Wi-Fi networks without worrying about data consumption.  To download shows and films, you must first have the latest version of the Netflix app. Once you've got that, tap on the drop down menu and head to the new section, Available for Download.  Here, you'll find a selection of shows and movies that content holders have deemed acceptable to download. Not everything is available yet, but there is a decent selection to choose from. You can also head to your app settings to choose whether you want to download shows in SD or HD \u2013 the choice will really come down to how much space you have on your smart device.", "stock": "NFLX"}, {"url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/sky-q-tv-bundles-will-soon-include-netflix", "label": 1, "source": "techradar", "date": "2018-03-01", "article": "It's a big week for Sky Q.

If you're an existing Sky and Netflix customer you'll be able to open the app on your Sky Q box and sign into your Netflix account as you would on any other device. This will, of course, mean your Netflix and Sky accounts remain separate, and you'll be paying the same separate monthly fees.

No prices for the new bundle have been announced yet; they'll be confirmed closer to the launch.

The move, which Sky is calling a \"major development\", will allow the broadcaster to cut its costs while also offering more affordable and convenient packages to customers.  With younger audiences used to the convenience and cost of cheaper streaming-only services, and the fact that younger generations are increasingly relying on rental properties where the installation of a satellite may not be permitted, the move has the potential to massively expand Sky's user base.

If so, then you might want to give Tubi a shot \u2013 like Sony's Crackle , it's a totally free, ad-supported streaming video service that you can access on loads of devices.  Tubi (a.k.a. Tubi TV) is stocked with an array of licensed movies and television shows from across the years, and much like Crackle, the selection is decidedly hit-or-miss. But Tubi really does have a lot of compelling movies on offer, and there's no premium element in play: you'll never have to reach for a credit card. There's no original content and little in the way of recent releases, but the selection is large and seems to be updated on a regular basis.  Ready to give it a shot? Here's how to drop the monthly fee and get started with Tubi TV.  How much does Tubi cost?  Truly, it's nothing: you won't hit a paywall at any point, nor can you toss in a credit card to eliminate ads or access premium content or perks. Tubi is 100% ad-supported, which means you'll see commercials before and also during content.  Luckily, the ads are usually pretty short and innocuous, and pop up inconsistently within and around the content. When watching an episode of a TV show, you'll probably see a short (30-second) commercial beforehand, and maybe a 15-second or 30-second ad in the middle. It varies, though: We watched Cowboy Bebop and didn't see any ads beforehand, but then it had two commercials for a total of 45 seconds at the middle point.  With movies, we've encountered different results, as well. A viewing of Arnold Schwarzenegger's The Running Man via the PlayStation 4 app began with a single short ad, but then continued uninterrupted for the next 45 minutes or so. There would also be an ad any time that I resumed the film after stopping, though.  On the other hand, Oldboy on the iPad app began without an ad, but then it played one every 12-15 minutes over the course of the flick. That's a little awkward, since the ad break won't always come at an opportune pause in the action, but overall the ads seem less prevalent than with Crackle.  How can I access Tubi?  Luckily, Tubi is pretty much everywhere in terms of platforms and devices. You can watch it via the website on your computer or elsewhere, while native apps are available on smartphones and tablets, not to mention set-top boxes and game consoles.  You'll find iOS and Android apps, for example, as well as apps for Roku, Apple TV, and Amazon Fire TV boxes. The PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Xbox 360 have native Tubi apps, too, and they're all pretty easy to use and navigate through.  Tubi doesn't require a login to watch some videos on the service, but anything that's rated R or otherwise has a Mature designation will require a free account. There's other value to using an account, however, such as queuing up interesting movies and shows, getting smart recommendations based on your viewing habits, and resuming something you started on any device.  What are Tubi's key features?  As mentioned before, Tubi is totally free and accessible from nearly any modern device you're likely to wield \u2013 so it has both of those things going for it.  More importantly, Tubi has a lot of free content available \u2013 quite a bit more than Crackle, based on browsing the extensive listings. According to the company, Tubi has more than 50,000 titles in its library, with key partnerships with Lionsgate, Paramount, MGM, and Starz helping to keep its content coffers full.  Granted, you might not be compelled to watch everything on Tubi, and that's about more than just preference. Tubi has a fair amount of random junk filling up its listings, with straight-to-DVD movies and a lot of other generic-looking fare that you've never heard of before. It's not anywhere near as curated for quality as premium services tend to be, and you'll have to dig around to find the good stuff.  But it does have a lot of stuff, and there are some solid gems in the mix. In terms of feature films, the selection as of this writing includes picks like Young Adult, Oldboy, True Grit (2010), School of Rock, Mulholland Drive, and Glengarry Glen Ross.  Tubi doesn't have a lot of high-profile TV shows, unfortunately, unless you're into Alf ... and why wouldn't you be? It has some cult favorites, too, like The IT Crowd and Spaced, plus Tubi's anime selection is pretty stellar, with series like Cowboy Bebop, Naruto, and Revolutionary Girl Utena available as of this posting.  Tubi seems to add new movies and shows gradually throughout the month, as well, so it's worth checking back and having a browse from time to time.  Why choose Tubi over Netflix?  It's all about the money, really, or the lack thereof. Netflix's monthly subscription fee has gradually risen over the years, particularly as the company pours billions into original shows and movies, and you're paying for exclusive content and a strong selection of newish movies and TV shows from elsewhere.  Tubi TV offers no high-profile exclusives, and the vast majority of the noteworthy content is at least several years old at this point. But Tubi TV has a surprisingly large library on offer, and it's all completely free \u2013 with a totally reasonable amount of video ads along the way.  Not finding what you're looking for on Netflix? Have a look on Tubi: it won't cost you anything, and maybe you'll stumble upon an old favorite flick or something appealing that you haven't seen before. Tubi probably won't replace Netflix for the average paying customer, but if you're not keen on spending for streaming video, then it's a strong ad-supported alternative.  Watch these shows  The IT Crowd: The cult-favorite British show nearly came here in an Americanized version, but thank goodness it didn't. Luckily, you can watch the entire hilarious original series \u2013 about the goofballs running a company's IT department \u2013 for free on Tubi.  Cowboy Bebop: One of the most beloved anime series around, Cowboy Bebop follows a ragtag bunch of space bounty hunters. It has wonderful characters, brilliant animation and music, and a potent blend of action, drama, wry humor, and emotional punch.  Spaced: Do you like Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz? If so, then don't miss Spaced, another UK cult favorite from director Edgar Wright and star Simon Pegg. Like their flicks, this sitcom is endlessly quotable and packed with pop culture adoration.  Watch these movies  Battle Royale: Haven't seen the original Japanese film that inspired everything from The Hunger Games to PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds? Well, this tale of a class of students all trying to kill each other is delightfully ultra-violent, and it's free on Tubi.  True Grit: The Coen Brothers' 2010 remake of the classic Western was a critical smash, paying loving tribute to the genre with a star-studded cast featuring Jeff Bridges, Matt Damon, Josh Brolin, and a young Hailee Steinfeld.  Oldboy: Speaking of super-twisted Japanese flicks: Oldboy is an incredibly intense film about a man secretly imprisoned for 15 years, and then set loose to find and destroy his unknown captor. It's a revenge film that you won't soon forget, assuming you can stomach it all.", "stock": "NFLX"}, {"url": "http://www.techradar.com/news/google-assistant-can-now-open-your-personal-netflix-profile-with-your-voice", "label": 1, "source": "techradar", "date": "2018-01-24", "article": "Netflix has supported Google Assistant for a while, but as it only started up the main user profile, the hands-free benefits of the voice assistant were somewhat limited if you lived in a busy household.

While it's perhaps easy to sympathize with the mega-director's lamentations regarding the decline of the cinematic experience, it strikes us as somewhat elitist to suggest that a film's distribution method somehow makes it less worthy of praise because it didn't have a significant theatrical run.  It's not just Spielberg that feels this way \u2014 it's been announced that Netflix Originals will no longer be eligible to compete in the Cannes Film Festival. Netflix's films can still be shown at the festival, but they won't be up for the prestigious Palme d'Or. It's a huge blow for the streaming service, considering that its film Okja was nominated for that very same award last year.  So is the Ready Player One director right about the original films on Netflix and other streaming services? Or does 'The Beard' just need to get with the times and accept that cinema has changed?  Steven Spielberg and the Sundance bid  Coming so shortly after Netflix's first Academy Award win with its feature-length documentary Icarus, it comes as a bit of a slap in the face to filmmakers and producers who opted for the best distribution approach available to them. This is part of the problem, according to Spielberg.  \"I\u2019m just saying fewer and fewer filmmakers are going to struggle to raise money in order to compete in Sundance and possibly get one of the specialty labels to release their films theatrically, publicly.\"  However, looking at the history of Netflix Original films to date, it's clear that very few of those films deliberately set out to be released on a streaming service \u2014 most Netflix Originals are purchased by the streaming giant at film festivals long after they've been completed. Many of them were actually acquired at Sundance.  Last year, Netflix spent $12.5 million at the Utah-based film festival for the acquisition of Mudbound, a film that would go on to be nominated for four Academy Awards. This year, the streaming giant came away from the Sundance film festival with a number of films that will be released as Netflix Originals, including the hotly-anticipated Seeing Allred and White Fang.  Filmmakers are still taking their films to Sundance, but Netflix is the distributor that's willing to buy them.  It's not just smaller festival flicks that Netflix is interested in, either. While not exactly a hit with critics, the Will Smith-starring Netflix Original Bright had a production budget worthy of any blockbuster, costing upwards of $90 million \u2014 far from what you'd consider a TV-movie budget.  Though Spielberg recognised that \"television is thriving with quality and heart,\u201d he remained firm on his stance. \"I\u2019ll still make The Post and ask an audience to please go out to theaters and see The Post and not make it for Netflix,\" he said.  The film industry \"implosion\"  In 2013, Spielberg and fellow beard George Lucas predicted an \"implosion\" in the film industry, telling USC students that, \"There's going to be an implosion where three or four or maybe even a half-dozen mega-budget movies are going to go crashing into the ground, and that's going to change the paradigm.\"  That change they spoke of predicted a world in which trips to the theater would be a more costly, prestige event, and where smaller films would either be shown at a vastly-reduced ticket price or would have to find alternative distribution avenues. \"The pathway to get into theaters is really getting smaller and smaller,\" said Lucas.  In response to a comment offered by Lucas, Spielberg spoke specifically about how his Academy Award-winning film Lincoln was very nearly an HBO movie.  \"I think eventually the Lincolns will go away and they're going to be on television,\" said Lucas regarding his friend's most recent film at the time. \"As mine almost was,\" chimed-in Spielberg. \"This close \u2013 ask HBO \u2013 this close.\"  By that reasoning, would this mean that Daniel Day-Lewis' incredible performance as Abraham Lincoln would've been less worthy of the Oscar it earned because of the film's ultimate distribution method? Of course, an Emmy is basically the television equivalent of an Academy Award, and carries its own kind of esteem, but the Oscars undeniably carry more gravitas and prestige.  And if we really are heading towards a future where only tentpole blockbusters are released in theaters and smaller dramas and independent films are relegated to the small screen, does that mean only Marvel and Star Wars films will be deserving of Oscar's praise in 20 years?  Had 2016's Best Picture winner Moonlight been made five years from now, it probably wouldn't receive the same 1,100 theater-release it had a couple of years ago by virtue of its smaller, more intimate nature \u2013 especially when you consider that that it's one of the lowest-grossing films to ever win the coveted award. No, five years from now we'd probably be watching it on Netflix or Amazon, because the big studios wouldn't want to take a chance and release such a risky proposition at the box office.  Either we get with the times and accept that streaming is here and can be a compelling option for many smaller, character-driven films \u2013 providing them with a home they likely wouldn't find otherwise \u2013 or we prepare ourselves for a future where Pirates of the Caribbean XII is up for serious awards contention.", "stock": "NFLX"}, {"url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/sky-and-netflix-finally-chill-and-pave-the-way-for-the-future-of-broadcasting", "label": 1, "source": "techradar", "date": "2018-03-01", "article": "When Sky Q launched two years ago, it was positioned as the ultimate home entertainment package but it had one big thing missing: Netflix.  The streaming service, already available on Sky-rival Virgin for some time, was nowhere to be seen. It was clear a deal wasn\u2019t done and it\u2019s taken longer than most thought for something to be put in place. But now it's official: Netflix is coming to Sky, in a first-of-its-kind partnership.  It\u2019s been revealed that Netflix won\u2019t just be available as a standalone app through Sky Q but a brand-new entertainment package. And if you are already a Netflix subscriber, then you just sign in and off you go.  This is significant, as it ties the two services together and should mean that the experience is that bit more seamless. We expect Netflix will still keep some of its identity but you only have to look at what Sky has done with the BBC iPlayer - another streaming service that is very protective of its IP - to make sure it blends in with the Sky UI.  This makes the deal somewhat different to the one Virgin Media has, where it pretty much just offers the Netflix app within its user interface, albeit in a dedicated section. It will also mean that Sky\u2019s great voice search functionality will now work with Netflix.  Sky and Netflix up a tree  Why is Netflix joining Sky so important? Well, there are myriad reasons. It marks a sea change for how Sky operates.  It overhauled its platform to take on the streaming giants. Sky Q was all about opening up its channels so they can be watched on TV, through an app, pause and played throughout the house. Sky was no longer tied to the TV experience but device agnostic.  This was functionality new to Sky customers but familiar to anyone who uses Netflix (or Amazon Prime) which comes at a far lower price than Sky subscription service.  Sky has been consistently updating its Sky Q service  Sky housing Netflix will mean it can now boast to being one of the largest holders of UHD and, subsequently, HDR content around - a key feature that's needed if you truly want to be a next-gen TV offering.  Then there\u2019s the small business of how you pay for Netflix. Currently, if you pay for Netflix direct then Netflix gets all your money. But there are deals around. For instance, you can get Netflix or Spotify through certain Vodafone contracts. And Sky is now doing a similar thing; getting both Spotify and Netflix through Sky will mean your payment will be migrated to Sky\u2019s service and that\u2019s a very powerful thing for Sky to have.  Keeping it simple  For the user, it simplifies things. It may feel like everyone and their dog has a Netflix account but it\u2019s likely many Sky customers have yet to make the leap as they are already paying a premium for a huge amount of content. We certainly haven\u2019t yet seen the mass migration away from the likes of Sky and Virgin to Netflix, which shows the services are still treated quite differently by users and proves maybe they can actually live alongside each other.  Netflix has been very clever to go after cord cutters in the way they market the service - no contract, you can stop at any time... these are important messages to have. This link-up with Sky reattaches the cord and opens up potential new customers for Netflix, though, ones that perhaps dismissed it before.  Having Netflix also on the Now TV Smart Stick will mean that it's building up its app ecosystem which is certain to help it long term, if and when it does eventually get rid of the satellite dish.  Stranger Things will be one of the shows available through Sky Q  The TV landscape is changing and Sky is doing all it can to stay relevant. It\u2019s investing heavily in original content but can\u2019t match Netflix\u2019s promise of \u2018700 new shows\u2019 this year. This tie-up means it doesn\u2019t have to, it can piggy back on Netflix's investment.  It also means that Netflix is no longer a choice over Sky but one that sits alongside. Oh, and those who already have both Sky and Netflix will finally be able to stop the HDMI swapping or Smart TV app hunting to watch Netflix when the link-up happens later in the year.  Making things easier for the viewer is one feature that should never be underestimated.", "stock": "NFLX"}, {"url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/best-shows-on-netflix-australia", "label": -1, "source": "techradar", "date": "2018-03-27", "article": "Since its arrival on Australian shores, we've enjoyed unfettered access to all of Netflix's critically-lauded original shows.

Rapture  Fans of hip-hop will definitely want to check out Rapture, the new Netflix Original documentary series which spends each episode with a different major player in the rap game, kicking off with Logic and featuring T.I., Just Blaze, 2 Chainz and more over the course of its entire run. in Rapture, the artists themselves are tasked with describing their careers, how they got to where they are, and what kind of cultural legacy they think they'll leave behind. Candid interviews with the artists and the people around them provide an eye-opening insight into a world that's not quite as it seems on the surface.  Seasons on Netflix: 1  2. Wild Wild Country  This six-part documentary series tells the almost-unbelievable story of a utopian cult that was founded by a charismatic Indian guru and went on to build its own city in the Oregon desert. Told using news stories and archival footage from the city\u2019s heyday in combination with present-day interviews with those who were there, the slowly-escalating series jumps from free love to stoushes between cult members and local Oregonians and culminates in attempted assassinations, legal battles, bombings and mass poisonings. It\u2019ll leave you wondering who\u2019s really in the right \u2014 and pondering what rules people are willing to break as they attempt to hold on to power. Wild Wild Country is one wild, wild ride.  Seasons on Netflix: 1  3. Santa Clarita Diet  Like a cross between Modern Family and The Walking Dead (with a spattering of Dexter thrown in for good measure), Santa Clarita Diet is a hilariously gory Netflix Original series that sees suburban mum Sheila (Drew Barrymore) suddenly acquire an insatiable hunger for human flesh. Though shocked at first, Sheila's loyal husband Joel (Timothy Olyphant) and daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) are determined to keep this family together, even if it means covering up a number of murders...  Seasons on Netflix: 2  4. Riverdale  Set aside any pre-conceived notions that you might have about a 'sexy Archie' series and get ready for one of the most addictive new shows of the year with Riverdale. First things first \u2014 this ain't your grandpappy's Archie show. A modern day re-imagining of the beloved comics franchise that has spanned almost eight decades, this Twin Peaks-inspired version of Riverdale is fraught with murder, deception and small town scandal. Famous characters like Jughead, Veronica, Betty and even Josie and the Pussycats are all present and accounted for, only with a decidedly millennial twist. The question on everybody's lips: Who killed star quarterback (and most popular kid in school) Jason Blossom? With new episodes fast-tracked from the US every Thursday, your only problem will the seven day wait between episodes.  Seasons on Netflix: 2  5. The Defiant Ones  Charting the rise of one of the world's most successful business partnerships, The Defiant Ones delves into the lives of Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre \u2014 two men who not only conquered the music industry, but whose famous Beats Electronics brand went on to become a $3 billion player in the tech world with its sale to Apple in 2014. Featuring a huge number of candid interviews from major music industry titans, including Bono, Eminem, Tom Petty, Stevie Nicks, Bruce Springstein, Gwen Stefani, Trent Reznor and more, this three-part documentary series (which is considered a Netflix Original in Australia despite being made by HBO) is a must-watch for music lovers and people fascinated by those who display an incredible business acumen.  Seasons on Netflix: 1  6. Marvel's Jessica Jones  In retrospect, it would seem impossible for Marvel to surpass its first Netflix Original series, Daredevil, with a show about a hard drinking ex-superhero that's little known outside of comic book circles, but that's pretty much what it's done with Jessica Jones. Though the show doesn't quite reach the action heights of Daredevil, Jessica Jones manages to be even more compelling in terms of story and character. Based on the comic Alias by Brian Michael Bendis, the first season of the show sees private investigator Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter), bar owner Luke Cage (Mike Colter) and celebrity Trish Walker (Rachael Taylor) do battle with a mind-controlling creep named Kilgrave (David Tennant), whose incredible obsession with Jessica is causing everyone around her to die. The second season follows on from the events of Marvel's The Defenders, and finds Jones delving into her past in order to make sense of her latest case. Dark, violent and quite sexual for a Marvel show, Jessica Jones is required viewing for fans of the MCU.  Seasons on Netflix: 2  7. Queer Eye  Queer Eye is back! While the original Fab Five are nowhere to be seen, a new team has been put together with the same ultimate mission: to remodel individuals into the best possible version of themselves, whether it be their wardrobe, living arrangements, grooming, diet or even their confidence. We know, makeover shows are usually pretty lame, but this one is fantastic in the way that the guys really get to the emotional heart of each subject they undertake. Often, there's a reason these men (who aren't all straight this time around) have let themselves go or have put up defensive walls against the outside world. Because the Fab Five really seem to care about them, it becomes incredibly rewarding to watch them go from unhappy to full of life. Chances are you'll cry at least once per episode.  Seasons on Netflix: 1  8. Everything Sucks!  Don't be put off by its twee trailers and the 1990s nostalgia-bait that lies therein \u2014 Everything Sucks! is actually a very endearing series that follows a group of young high schoolers (and their parents) as they struggle with new found feelings of love. It's the first day of high school for Luke (Jahi Di'Allo Winston) and his geeky friends, and the boys immediately meet Kate (Peyton Kennedy), the principal's daughter, in AV Club. Luke falls for her right away, but there's one problem \u2014 Kate is starting to realise that she actually likes girls. Meanwhile, Kate's widower dad (Patch Darragh) and Luke's single mother (Claudine Mboligikpelani Nako) have started a secret relationship, and it's only a matter of time before everything blows up in their faces. Funny and surprisingly heartfelt, Everything Sucks! is much more than a '90s-set Freaks and Geeks clone.  Seasons on Netflix: 1  9. Altered Carbon  Based on the science fiction novel of the same name by Richard K. Morgan, Altered Carbon explores a futuristic world where death has become an inconvenience rather than a permanent state. A human's entire life can be backed up onto a chip in their neck, so when they die, they can move onto to a different body and continue on in another form. But when a wealthy man's chip is destroyed by a would-be assassin (lucky he's rich enough to have a 24-hour satellite backup), he brings Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman) out of digital prison after 250 years to solve his murder. Kovacs is the last remaining Envoy, a super soldier who is now tasked with working for the very people he fought a war against. With an epic scope and a visual style influenced by the cyberpunk classic Blade Runner, Altered Carbon is the most epic show that Netflix has produced to date.  Seasons of Netflix: 1  10. Ugly Delicious  A documentary series that simultaneously celebrates food while asking why we like it in the first place, Ugly Delicious is a must-watch for any food lover. World-renowned chef David Chang takes us on a culinary journey, exploring the foods we cherish, from pizza to barbecue and everything in between. Rather than just show us the best forms of each dish, Chang's approach is entirely different, looking back at the history and ethnography of each meal and asking us to do away with our food elitism. It's only then that we can open our minds up to the endless possibilities of what food can actually be.  Seasons on Netflix: 1  Want to know more about Netflix's take on binging?

That's apparently the thinking behind a new feature currently being tested on the video streaming service, which rewards children with stickers when they watch certain shows.  According to a report from Variety, those involved in the test see red padlocks on the top of TV shows that can earn them a badge. At the moment at least, that's all the reward that they get \u2013 there's no other incentive to race through a whole series of Paw Patrol.  It would seem that only a small subsection of Netflix users have the feature enabled for the time being, so it's by no means definite that this is going to roll out for everyone. Netflix is always keen for viewers young and old to spend as much time as possible on the platform though, so it would make sense.  \"A more interactive experience\"  \"We are testing a new feature on select kids titles that introduces collectible items for a more interactive experience, adding an element of fun and providing kids something to talk about and share around the titles they love,\" Netflix told Variety. \"We learn by testing and this feature may or may not become part of the Netflix experience.\"  Some parents have taken to social media to complain that the scheme is going to make it harder to pull kids away from their various screens, while others have reported that the introduction of badges is definitely working for Netflix.  Netflix recently introduced improved parental controls so moms and dads can block specific TV shows or movies they don't want their kids watching. Maturity ratings are also going to become more visible before a title starts playing, giving parents a better idea of what to expect before they start watching.", "stock": "NFLX"}, {"url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/vodafone-enters-the-aussie-video-streaming-arena-with-its-own-android-tv-box", "label": -1, "source": "techradar", "date": "2018-03-28", "article": "In a market that\u2019s already saturated with streaming devices like Telstra TV and Optus\u2019 Fetch TV , another Australian telco has joined the fray.

One of the most notable things the Netflix chief mentioned is that his streaming service doesn't have any plans whatsoever to do live TV, even if rivals like Hulu and Amazon's Prime Video are investing heavily in that space. \"To follow a competitor, never, never, never,\" he said. \"We have so much we want to do in our area, so we're not trying to copy others, whether that's linear cable, there's lots of things we don't do. We don't do [live] news, we don't do [live] sports. But what we do do, we try to do really well.\"  He said that while \"all of these media companies\" are trying to get into video, specifically newcomers such as Facebook, Netflix has been competing with seasons rivals like Amazon for a decade and he's happy with the success of his company thus far. Earlier this year, during its Q4 2017 earnings report, Netflix announced that it added 8.3 million new customers that quarter, its largest single-quarter growth ever. Those numbers certainly seem to bolster Hasting's confidence. He said that, while it's a very competitive market at the moment -- and it's only going to get tougher with others like Facebook and YouTube joining the fray -- he believes that if Netflix continues to produce great series and content, it has nothing to worry about.  \"If we do our own Prime service, we'll never succeed,\" he said, referring to the idea that Netflix could offer something beyond its on-demand content. He added that what hurts Netflix's competitors is that \"their strategy is to win by being broad, you know, a little bit of everything.\" Hastings said it's also key to ensure customers that they're never going to see ads on a Netflix product, despite the potential for lower prices and creating more revenue. Hastings didn't have to mention Hulu or YouTube by name to know those are the platforms he was referring to. \"Really having great experience -- no advertisements or chopping up all of the content -- vastly outweigh the fact that one company is gaining a lot of influence.\"", "stock": "NFLX"}, {"url": "https://www.engadget.com/2018/04/04/netflix-orders-an-adult-animated-show-about-terrible-cops/", "label": 1, "source": "engadget", "date": "2018-04-04", "article": "If you ever wanted to watch an edgy comedy about a wildly incompetent police force and their talking dog attempting to take down a drug ring in small town America, then we have good news for you.

Photo: facundo arrizabalaga/epa-efe/rex/EPA/Shutterstock  The world\u2019s media titans are locked in battle over Sky. The company driving the multibillion-dollar bidding drama is happily sitting on the couch: Netflix . NFLX 0.78%  Comcast gate-crashed an already lively party Tuesday by offering \u00a312.50 ($17.50) a share for Sky. That is 12% more than the \u00a310.75 on offer from 21st Century Fox and, by extension, Disney , DIS -0.04% which wants to buy Sky along with other Fox assets.  Including debt, the Comcast offer values Sky at $41 billion, which works out at 13 times expected earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, according to FactSet. Dish Network, traditionally a satellite distributor like Sky, trades on roughly five times Ebitda, after stripping out its spectrum assets, according to Will Milner at research house Arete.  Admittedly, Sky has a much stronger market position than Dish. It was the U.K.\u2019s first pay-TV company, with an offer anchored by Premier League soccer, and it has kept at the forefront of industry innovations like the set-top box and \u201cover-the-top\u201d streaming. As a result, it still serves more than twice as many U.K. households as its closest peer, Liberty Global\u2019s Virgin Media cable network.  This is Sky\u2019s essential appeal to both Comcast and Disney. It has a direct relationship with 23 million customers, not far from Comcast\u2019s 29 million. And they are mainly in markets\u2014the U.K. and Ireland\u2014that are already familiar with the kind of English-language TV content that both Comcast and Disney own and produce. In this Sky has no real peers.  Streaming giant Netflix\u2019s high stock-market valuation shows the appeal to investors of a global \u201cdirect-to-consumer\u201d platform. Something of this high valuation is now rubbing off on Sky as Disney and Comcast are both feeling increasing pressure to roll out something that competes with Netflix.  Both U.S. cable-and-media groups look set to be major beneficiaries of U.S. tax cuts, giving them cash to splurge. And given the antitrust uncertainty surrounding AT&T\u2019s bid for Time Warner, it is easy to see why Comcast has opted to focus on Sky rather than Fox. For regulators, Comcast may be the preferred bidder, with none of the issues about concentration of ownership in British media that have dogged Fox\u2019s bid.  The irony here is that Sky is itself being disrupted by streaming. Its growth has become increasingly dependent on its own over-the-top product, Now TV, which is much cheaper than its old full-service package. Some 2% to 3% of households are trading down from the premium package to Now TV a year. Stripping out mobile-phone contracts, research firm New Street Research estimates that Sky\u2019s U.K. subscription revenue\u2014the bedrock of its business\u2014rose just 0.8% year over year in the most recent quarter. Meanwhile, heavy technology investments have weighed on cash flows.  Sky shares rose to \u00a313.40 in afternoon trading Tuesday, suggesting investors expect a counteroffer from Fox or Disney. But the U.S. media giants should be wary of engaging in a bidding war for what is essentially an incumbent TV provider. Sky could end up part of the problem, not part of the solution.  The cable industry is undergoing a major transformation, as more Americans cut the cord on their cable subscriptions and flock to streaming services like Hulu and Netflix. So how did we get here?

He and his cast sampled the Mexican staple everywhere from the Yucat\u00e1n to Copenhagen.  One of his favorite tacos came from a food truck in L.A. It featured ingredients usually associated with the Middle East\u2014shawarma (meat sliced from a turning spit) and a thick, pitalike flour tortilla. In the show, he traced the history of these \u201cArab tacos\u201d back to the city of Puebla, about 80 miles southeast of Mexico City. There, Mr. Chang learned, immigrants from the Middle East helped to create the tacos decades ago.  He came across plenty of other cross-cultural connections in exploring other iconic dishes for the show. In Houston, he tasted Viet-Cajun crawfish, a combination of a New Orleans Creole dish with Vietnamese seasoning. In Italy, he noted how much tortellini look like wontons. \u201cEvery type of food came from somewhere else,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that just sprouted from someone\u2019s head.\u201d  Mr. Chang, 40, is best known for founding the Momofuku Group, with over a dozen Asian-inspired restaurants around the world, as well as six locations of the fast-casual chain Fuku and 13 Milk Bar dessert stores. He\u2019s still expanding his restaurant empire, which offers indulgent, sometimes oddball dishes such as kimchi bacon burgers and his much-imitated barbecued pork-belly buns. The chef and his restaurants have won five James Beard Awards, and one of the New York locations, Momofuku Ko, has carried two Michelin stars since 2009.  \u201cI think Momofuku has always tried to be a merger of things that don\u2019t always go together,\u201d Mr. Chang says. As for his show, \u201cwhen you say the word \u2018ugly delicious\u2019 it made sense.\u201d Many of his favorite dishes, such as curries and noodles, look ugly, he says.  The show\u2019s eight thematic episodes range from fried chicken to pizza to barbecue. The series asks why some cultures and not others readily assimilate new foods and dishes from afar. An area\u2019s tradition and its immigration history are major factors, Mr. Chang discovered. New Orleans, he found, was hesitant to accept new flavors and experimentation, in part thanks to a proud Creole culinary past. Houston, on the other hand, embraced waves of immigrants and their cooking techniques.  Mr. Chang now appreciates his own culture more, he says, partly because he \u2018ran away from it to begin with.\u2019 Photo: Austin Hargrave for The Wall Street Journal  For Mr. Chang, such stories have a strong personal resonance. The son of Korean immigrants, he grew up outside of Washington, D.C., in suburban Virginia. His mother made fried rice and chicken soup and his grandmother would make Korean dumplings, he remembers. His father used to take him to local pho and ramen spots, where Mr. Chang would watch in wonder as the chefs worked the dough and pulled it into long strands. \u201cThat\u2019s how my dad expressed love to me, by going out to eat,\u201d he says.  His parents were in the restaurant business for a time, but their two establishments served American fare\u2014 salads, soups and steaks. Mr. Chang never thought he would grow up to be a chef. \u201cI knew restaurants were in my dad\u2019s blood,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand until later that it could be a profession.\u201d  Mr. Chang was a champion golfer in high school, and his father wanted him to try being a professional, but he didn\u2019t enjoy the sport. Unsure of a career, he spent two years after college teaching English in Japan, where he fell in love with the local ramen shops. He kept copious notes of what he saw there, right down to the flavorings in the first slurp of soup.  When he returned to the U.S., he took a desk job in finance\u2014and hated it. He quit after six months and enrolled at the French Culinary Institute (now the International Culinary Center) in New York, with stints afterward at high-end restaurants in the city such as Craft and Caf\u00e9 Boulud.  When he finally decided to strike out on his own, it was to embrace the Asian food of his childhood: \u201cI think part of it is accepting being me.\u201d He now appreciates his own culture more, he says, partly because he \u201cran away from it to begin with.\u201d  In 2004, Mr. Chang started Momofuku Noodle Bar as a casual ramen spot. In six months, once he adjusted the menu to his liking, lines started forming out the door. His restaurant empire has expanded relentlessly since then.  Critics heaped praise on Mr. Chang\u2019s early restaurants but have not been as enthusiastic about one recent venture. A 2016 review of his new Italian-inflected restaurant by New York Times food critic Pete Wells was headlined: \u201cDavid Chang\u2019s Magic Shows a Little Wear.\u201d  Mr. Chang responded to the review in a New Yorker profile of Mr. Wells, saying, \u201cHe\u2019s being a [expletive] bully.\u201d These days, Mr. Chang thinks that customer reviews on services such as Yelp carry just as much weight as the opinions of professional critics.  Mr. Chang has experienced some failures as his business has expanded. Last year, he attempted to launch his own meal-preparation and delivery service, and a few years before that he invested in another. Both have since closed. Mr. Chang has said that delivery services were difficult to get right.  But the chef is still creating new concepts for restaurants and figuring out where to start them. Majordomo, which opened earlier this year in L.A., offers creative takes on basics and recently included short ribs with beef rice and shiso rice paper, and macaroni and chickpeas with black pepper.  Mr. Chang remains committed to experimenting and expanding. \u201cIt\u2019s this giant thing, and I don\u2019t know how it grows, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s going to grow.\u201d But he worries, too: \u201cEvery day feels like it\u2019s all going to end simultaneously.\u201d  Write to Alexandra Wolfe at alexandra.wolfe@wsj.com", "stock": "NFLX"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-medicare-could-learn-from-netflix-1519168902", "label": 0, "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "date": "2018-02-20", "article": "Matters that seem arcane are often vitally important, because they can be worth tens of billions of dollars. Such is the case with \u201crisk adjustment\u201d in health care. Medical spending is not spread evenly across all people in society. Half the population uses hardly any care in a given year\u2014only 3% of total spending. Conversely, 10% of Americans consume about two-thirds of all health-care spending.  Consequently, when someone buys an ObamaCare plan or enrolls in a Medicare Advantage managed-care plan, the federal government needs to adjust the fixed premium (or subsidy) it pays to account for how sick the person is. Patients who have serious conditions come with bigger government payments. Without this adjustment, insurers and health-care providers would have a strong incentive to care only for healthy people.  Photo: istock/getty images  While the concept sounds simple, risk adjustment is among the factors that make health care so maddeningly complicated. For an \u201caverage patient\u201d in Erie County, N.Y., the government will pay a private insurer offering a Medicare Advantage plan roughly $9,500 a year. But for a patient with lung cancer, diabetes with complications, depression and macular degeneration, risk adjustment triples the amount to just over $27,000 a year.  That large difference is intended to ensure that the sick patient can continue to get care. But consider the incentives it sets up. As every physician knows, many diseases are diagnosed and their severity assessed based on clinical judgment as opposed to objective criteria. Others may be under control or no longer relevant and aptly characterized as \u201cpast medical history.\u201d Finally, many conditions emerge in almost everyone with age.  Risk adjustment gives doctors and Medicare Advantage insurers a financial reason to ignore these nuances. Instead they have incentives to find every possible diagnosis\u2014and then to make the patient\u2019s conditions sound as severe as possible\u2014so as to raise government payments the most.  This gaming is pervasive enough to have a name: up-coding. In 2016 the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services audited 37 Medicare Advantage health plans. Thirty-five had overcharged the government, commonly by overstating the severity of diabetes and depression. A 2016 study from the Government Accountability Office suggests this practice costs taxpayers billions of dollars a year in overpayments.  Because Medicare cannot police every plan, it has attacked the problem with a sledgehammer, enacting an annual \u201ccoding intensity adjustment,\u201d which in 2018 will reduce premiums by \u201cat least 5.91%.\u201d But this adjustment, which insurers aggressively lobby to minimize, penalizes honest Medicare Advantage plans, too. Ultimately, it does not solve the problem because insurers build the \u201cpenalty\u201d into their premiums.  Up-coding also diverts providers and insurers from finding ways to improve care and reduce costs. This effect is reinforced by the Affordable Care Act\u2019s \u201cmedical loss ratio\u201d rules, which require insurers to spend at least 85% of premiums on clinical care. The only way to increase profits, then, is to raise revenues while keeping administrative costs the same. Gaming risk adjustment is an easy way to do that.  Doctors find risk adjustment incredibly frustrating. Medicare Advantage plans torment them with reminders to do annual visits, in the guise of \u201cwellness visits,\u201d to code every disease in every patient. A whole industry of opportunistic intermediaries like Inovalon, hired by health-insurance companies, support up-coding by retrieving patient charts, mining them for abnormal lab values or prescriptions indicative of diseases that aren\u2019t being billed, and then faxing back \u201csuggestions\u201d for added diagnoses. This distracts doctors, provides no value for patients, and sucks tons of money out of the system.  How to clean up this mess? Begin by acknowledging that current methods of risk adjustment are not very good. On average, the factors used by Medicare today\u2014mainly data from past claims\u2014can account for only about 36% of the true variation in patient spending due to disease. That means lots of extra money is flowing for diagnoses that do not necessarily imply the assumed increased costs.  One way for Medicare to do better would be to emulate Netflix . Beginning in 2006, Netflix ran a world-wide contest to improve Cinematch, its proprietary algorithm for predicting how users would rate films they\u2019d never seen. The grand prize was $1 million. Within a year, over 2,000 separate teams from 150 countries had submitted more than 13,000 algorithms. Eventually, the winning team, which included researchers from AT&T Labs, Yahoo and an Austrian consulting firm, improved the algorithm by more than 10%. For a tiny cost, Netflix got a huge amount of computer-science research that even its highly skilled employees could not perform.  Medicare should do the same: create a contest open to anyone in the world who can beat its current risk-adjustment model. To ensure fairness and encourage competition, administering it should be outsourced to the X Prize Foundation or a similar group. The winner should be able to use objective patient data to account for at least 45% of the spending variation caused by disease. Medicare could award a $10 million grand prize and several million for second and third place. It also should be required to adopt one of the top methods. (There may be practical reasons not to pick the winner.)  To prevent insurers from figuring out how to game this updated risk-adjustment model, Medicare should run a new contest every five to seven years. Tens of millions in prize money could save taxpayers tens of billions a year in up-coding gimmicks.

The streaming video giant\u2019s stock is down 4.9% in the first two days of the week to about $316, a rare pullback for shares that have more than doubled over the last 12 months and climbed 22% in the last month alone. The gains have outshone many of Netflix\u2019s high-flying tech-focused peers.  The recent drop followed remarks by short-seller Andrew Left of Citron Research, who said in a tweet Monday that shares, \u201ccan be shorted back to $300,\u201d after the company\u2019s market cap surged in the preceding week.  \u201cI think the market has become over-enthused by the product and not realistic about the economics,\u201d he said in an interview. Mr. Left, who is known for shorting such companies as Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc., said he is currently betting against the stock.  Netflix shares have a long history of momentum-driven growth that\u2019s drawn passionate arguments from both bulls and bears. The company has posted consistently strong subscriber growth and invested heavily in its original content. It\u2019s also been burning through cash and borrowing heavily. It faces a slew of upstart rivals, from Amazon.com Inc. to Walt Disney Co.  Scott Devitt, an analyst at Stifel, recently dropped his rating on the company to \u201chold,\u201d from \u201cbuy.\u201d In a report to clients last week, he wrote that the \u201cshare price may have sprinted ahead of fundamentals in the short-term.\u201d  The company\u2019s chief executive, Reed Hastings, has counted himself among the stock price skeptics in the past. In the summer of 2015, when the stock was at about $100, Mr. Hastings said in response to a question about whether the stock is overpriced: \u201cwhen the stock was half this price, I described it as euphoric. So it\u2019s a mystery to me.\u201d  Still, the recent surge has its benefits, the company has said. In a recent quarterly letter, the company noted that a thick \u201cequity cushion\u201d has been good for its borrowing in the junk bond market. The company has about $6.5 billion in total debt, according to FactSet, and its bond prices have held up relatively well recently. A spokesman for the firm declined to comment.  The Netflix critics have had a tough run recently. The stock had an average short position worth $5.5 billion so far this year, which has sustained paper losses of nearly $3 billion in 2018 through the end of last week, according to financial analytics firm S3 Partners. So far this week, they\u2019ve made back about $319 million.  Short sellers bet against a stock by borrowing from a lender and selling it, hoping to buy it back at a lower price when they return it later on. They pocket the difference if the stock has fallen, but can expose themselves to sharp losses if it rises, as Netflix has done.  The number of shorted shares has fallen recently as investors pared their positions. Many have bumped up against limits on how much risk they can take as the stock price has risen, according to Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3. Short interest as a share of float hit an all-time low of just under 5% last month, as fewer shares were shorted and the number of outstanding shares increased.  \u2013 Ken Jimenez and Sam Goldfarb contributed to this article", "stock": "NFLX"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-ts-south-park-argument-1521397501", "label": -1, "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "date": "2018-03-18", "article": "The biggest antitrust trial since U.S. v. Microsoft begins Monday in a federal court in Washington. The Justice Department seeks to block the $108 billion merger between AT&T and Time Warner. But the government doesn\u2019t stand a chance\u2014like Wile E. Coyote chasing Road Runner off a cliff and ending up suspended in midair.  What may have started as a Trumpian jab at #FakeNewsCNN has tragically turned into a serious antitrust action. The Justice Department\u2019s case stands on such modern foundations as Section 7 of the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, which can block mergers whose effect \u201cmay be substantially to lessen competition.\u201d  The crux of the case is that AT&T\u2019s subsidiary DirecTV, with its 21 million U.S. subscribers (about a fifth of the cable and satellite market), should not be combined with Time Warner\u2019s HBO, with its 54 million U.S. subscribers. The result would be a \u201cvertically integrated programmer\u201d with the alleged ability to raise prices at will on other cable operators. It could even (horrors) withhold HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d from DirecTV\u2019s competitors.  I\u2019ve got to admit, even four or five years ago, I might have agreed. The cable industry has abused geographic monopolies to raise prices almost since the first coaxial cables were strung on telephone poles. Comcast \u2019s 2011 merger with NBCUniversal was potentially anticompetitive, which is why the government imposed 150 different conditions on it. But the landscape has changed since then. A lot.  AT&T Inc. and DirecTV signage at a store in Newport Beach, Calif., Aug. 10, 2017. Photo: Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg News  If I were AT&T\u2019s attorney, I\u2019d introduce as evidence a clip from the \u201cFranchise Prequel\u201d episode of \u201cSouth Park,\u201d which makes fun of Netflix for funding so many new TV series. A Netflix employee answers the phone saying: \u201cNetflix, you\u2019re greenlit. Who am I speaking with? . . . Would you like a pilot or just go straight to an order of six episodes?\u201d  Since \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d took off in 2013, Netflix has run amok, releasing an estimated 126 original series and films in 2016, and maybe 200 last year. That\u2019s something on the order of 1,000 hours, or 40 full days, of binge watching. Some of these efforts are great, some are good, and most are just filler, like \u201c Bill Nye Saves the World.\u201d But so what? The point is they are distributed on the internet, via cable modems or mobile phones. AT&T and Time Warner have little influence, and nobody\u2014from ABC to HBO\u2014has a lock on entertainment these days.  Netflix has 55 million American subscribers and, gulp, raised its prices in November. Netflix doesn\u2019t license its shows to anyone else in the U.S.! Should the government break it up? By the way, that \u201cSouth Park\u201d episode is available on Viacom \u2019s Comedy Central, though Hulu\u2019s 17 million subscribers can also watch it online.  Amazon Prime has something like 80 million subscribers in the U.S., and 26 million of them watch the company\u2019s original content. Google\u2019s YouTube is now offering streaming TV, basically a $40-a-month substitute for cable. Similarly, Hulu has Live TV and Sony has PlayStation Vue. All March Madness games can be streamed online. Consumers have choices.  And we\u2019re just getting started. Worried about cord-cutting, Disney has paid $2.5 billion for a 75% stake in BAMTech, Major League Baseball\u2019s streaming company. RBC analyst Steven Cahall suggests Disney could spend $15 billion a year on streaming shows. That partially explains why Mickey Mouse is chasing 21st Century Fox .  Or look at the raw figures. Programming is a $90-billion-a-year business. Both Fox and Time Warner spend around $8 billion on nonsports content. Netflix spent $6 billion last year and hopes to hit $8 billion in 2018. Amazon spends $5 billion. Where is the market dominance?  Apple has sold more than a billion iPhones and is spending $1 billion this year getting its feet wet with original programming. The company recently put up millions for two seasons of a show about, ugh, a TV morning show, produced and starring Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston. If anything, extreme competition has shifted the balance of power to actors\u2014or, as some in Silicon Valley call them, meat puppets.  The AT&T antitrust case smells quite similar to the arguments for net neutrality, which also ignore real competition and emerging technologies. The feds are chasing ghosts. As they should be well aware, vertically structured companies tend to fall ill or die from natural causes\u2014see General Motors , IBM and, well, AT&T. No one pays 25 cents a minute for long-distance calls anymore.  Still, I\u2019m not sure why AT&T needs to get in bed with Hollywood, which year after year degrades the meaning of \u201cBest Picture.\u201d AT&T should instead return to a focus on technical excellence. I\u2019d rather that it run fiber on every highway and byway in America than peddle mediocre sitcoms.", "stock": "NFLX"}, {"url": "https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2018/02/06/stocks-to-watch-boeing-netflix-gm-lululemon-micron-skyworks-pfizer-adm/", "label": 1, "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "date": "2018-02-06", "article": "Here are some of the companies with shares expected to trade actively in Tuesday\u2019s session.

VZ -0.17% and Comcast Corp. CMCSA -0.33% are in tight competition for least-inspiring telecom company.  Cable network subscribers have gone from single-digit growth, to flat and now to declining. For Verizon and Comcast, both of which reported fourth-quarter earnings this week, those losses are getting worse as subscribers opt for streaming services like Netflix.  Verizon lost 29,000 Fios video customers this quarter, up from 18,000 in the third quarter and 15,000 in the second. Comcast similarly reported a loss of 33,000 video customers, an increase from 22,390 last quarter.  The erosion is unlikely to slow soon. \u201cWe don\u2019t expect the level of competition to diminish,\u201d Comcast said of the video sector.  \u201cWhy watch live TV?\u201d says Rich Greenfield of BTIG Research. \u201cThe amount of content on demand has gotten really good, really fast. And cable networks are competing not just against new shows, but against every great show ever made.\u201d  Verizon offset these losses as more customers signed up for wireless plans and high-speed internet. It narrowly missed analysts\u2019 expectations, reporting 86 cents per share, rather than 88 cents, and revenue of $33.96 billion. Savings from tax cuts will give it $3.5 billion to $4 billion in extra cash, boosting full-year earnings. Shares are up 1% since it announced results on Tuesday.  Comcast\u2019s results were stronger, reporting 49 cents per share above the 47-cent estimates, and revenue of $21.92 billion. It will use its tax windfall to increase its dividend by 21% and buy back $5 billion in stock this year. Investors are likely disappointed that the company wasn\u2019t more aggressive in its share buybacks. Shares were flat after the announcement on Wednesday.  \u201cIt\u2019s impolitic to buy back too much at once. Trump has said he doesn\u2019t want that to happen,\u201d said Craig Moffett, a media analyst at MoffettNathanson.  The buyback also leaves little room for acquisitions. Despite a deal-making rush in the industry, Verizon similarly insisted that it will not seek a merger.  Neither company looks compelling for the foreseeable future. But with strong growth in its NBCUniversal business and the Super Bowl and Winter Olympics expected to bring in $1.4 billion in ad revenue, Comcast remains slightly less uninspiring.  The cable industry is undergoing a major transformation, as more Americans cut the cord on their cable subscriptions and flock to streaming services like Hulu and Netflix. So how did we get here?

Image: Netflix/Beta Films  The roaring 1920s are given a German twist in \u201cBabylon Berlin,\u201d a lavish television series that chronicles the social turmoil leading up to the Third Reich.  It premiered last October in Germany and became one of the country\u2019s most-watched shows, just behind the seventh season of \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d On Tuesday it begins streaming in the U.S. via Netflix , with subtitles. The show\u2019s depiction of crime, corruption and political unrest led German newspaper Die Zeit to note its \u201calmost eerie parallels to the present.\u201d  \u201cAt the time people did not realize how absolutely unstable this new construction of society which the Weimar Republic represented was,\u201d says series co-director Tom Tykwer. \u201cIt interested us because the fragility of democracy has been put to the test quite profoundly in recent years.\u201d  Hitler\u2019s name is only mentioned once during the German-language show\u2019s first season, and then only when he is referred to as a joke candidate. In the German federal election of 1928, Nazis won a mere 2.6% of the vote. Five years later, they took 44%.  Tom Tykwer previously directed \u2018Run Lola Run\u2019 and other films before tackling \u2018Babylon Berlin.\u2019 Photo: Axel Schmidt/REUTERS  Based on novels by the German crime writer Volker Kutscher, \u201cBabylon Berlin\u201d cost about $40 million, making it one of the most expensive German TV series ever made, according to a spokeswoman for Beta Film, which sold the series in 60 countries. It is also the first German co-production between a public broadcaster, ARD, and a private one, Sky, she said.  Co-written and co-directed by Mr. Tykwer and fellow German filmmakers Henk Handloegten and Achim von Borries, the show required 180 days of shooting, nearly 300 locations, 5,000 extras and features a jazzy soundtrack from Bryan Ferry. It stars 37-year-old Volker Bruch \u2014one of the leads in the Emmy-winning \u201cGeneration War\u201d\u2014as Gereon Rath, a haunted, self-medicating police commissioner from Cologne who is transferred to the vice squad in Berlin, a city he knows little about.  \u201cFrom the first day the city swallows him up in a big breath,\u201d says producer Stefan Arndt, who helped develop the show. \u201cCologne is old-fashioned, while in Berlin there\u2019s sex, drugs and women with short hair.\u201d  One of these women is Charlotte Ritter (Liv Lisa Fries) who supports her impoverished family by working as an archivist for the police by day and a prostitute by night. Her dream is to become the first woman to be employed as a detective in the all-male Berlin police force.  Liv Lisa Fries plays Charlotte Ritter in \u2018Babylon Berlin.\u2019 Photo: X Filme Creative Pool  \u201cBy 1929, new opportunities were arising,\u201d says Mr. Tykwer, whose fast-paced direction is reminiscent of his 1998 breakout film \u201cRun Lola Run.\u201d \u201cWomen had more possibilities to take part in society, especially in the labor market as Berlin became crowded with new thinking, new art, theater, music and journalistic writing.\u201d  Nonetheless Mr. Tykwer says that he and his co-directors were determined not to idealize those days. \u201cPeople tend to forget that it was also a very rough era in German history,\u201d the 52-year-old director says. \u201cThere was a lot of poverty, and people who had survived the war were suffering from a great deal of trauma.\u201d  Mr. Rath\u2019s first case when he arrives in Berlin is to bust a pornography ring whose members have been covertly filming prominent public figures having sex with prostitutes. The show also examines police brutality toward communists in the Weimar Republic and the stealthy, post-World War I buildup of a secret army that is far greater than the one permitted by the Treaty of Versailles.  \u201cFrom an historical perspective the series is very acute in showing how Weimar democracy was under attack both from the communist left, as well as by traditional conservatives, in a kind of unholy alliance,\u201d says Thomas Weber, a German historian not involved with the show but whose 2010 book \u201cHitler\u2019s First War\u201d is in development as a TV series.  By the end of season two of \u201cBabylon Berlin,\u201d which has already aired in Germany, the Nazi Party is beginning to make its xenophobic presence felt, as citizens grow disillusioned with the Weimar Republic\u2014a period Mr. Weber sees as mirrored in Germany today with the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany party.  The AfD has rejected any comparison with the Nazi party. But it is robustly anti-immigration and some of its leaders have called for a reassessment of 20th-century German history.  On Netflix, the two eight-episode seasons of \u201cBabylon Berlin\u201d are joining other foreign-language shows available to U.S. subscribers, including France\u2019s \u201cThe Frozen Dead,\u201d South Korea\u2019s \u201cBlack\u201d and Spain\u2019s \u201cLa Casa de Papel.\u201d  Mr. Handloegten says that the show\u2019s third season, currently being written, will encompass the 1929 stock market crash, which was devastating to Germany\u2019s working class.  \u201cOne of the main reasons to make \u2018Babylon Berlin\u2019 was to show how all these Nazis did not just fall from the sky,\u201d he says. \u201cThey were human beings who reacted to German society\u2019s changes and made their decisions accordingly.\u201d  Write to Tobias Grey at wsje.weekend@wsj.com", "stock": "NFLX"}, {"url": "https://in.reuters.com/article/alphabet-google/google-aims-to-get-diverse-perspectives-into-search-results-idINKBN1FK0D5", "label": -1, "source": "reuters", "date": "2018-01-31", "article": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google will put more of a premium on \u201cdiverse perspectives\u201d in its search results, saying in a blog post on Tuesday that answers highlighted at the top of result pages would soon display multiple viewpoints on topics for the first time ever.

Other changes announced by Google last year were aimed at helping stem conspiracy theories and offensive information from making it into the highlighted results, which Google calls \u201cfeatured snippets.\u201d  Google typically plucks snippets from third-party websites and shows them in a large box before the traditional list of links in search results.

Google tries to answer with information \u201cstrongly aligned\u201d with the search so a webpage contending reptiles are nice pets would likely be shown, Sullivan said. But users ultimately want to know how reptiles rate as pets one way or the other. The featured snippet for \u201care reptiles bad pets\u201d would be valuable too even if it contradicts the first snippet, he said.

Now it wants to take a cut of their purchases, too.  The U.S. technology company is teaming up with retailers including Target Corp, Walmart Inc, Home Depot Inc, Costco Wholesale Corp and Ulta Beauty Inc.  Under a new program, retailers can list their products on Google Search, as well as on the Google Express shopping service, and Google Assistant on mobile phones and voice devices.  In exchange for Google listings and linking to retailer loyalty programs, the retailers pay Google a piece of each purchase, which is different from payments that retailers make to place ads on Google platforms.  The listings will appear under sponsored shopping results and will not affect regular search results on Google, the company said.  Google\u2019s pitch to retailers is a better chance to influence shoppers\u2019 purchasing decisions, a move that is likely to help them compete with rival Amazon.com Inc. Google hopes the program helps retailers capture more purchases on desktop, cell phones and smart home devices with voice search \u2013 the next frontier for e-commerce.  The previously unreported initiative sprang from Google\u2019s observation that tens of millions of consumers were sending image searches of products, asking \u201cWhere can I buy this?\u201d \u201cWhere can I find it?\u201d \u201cHow can I buy it?\u201d \u201cHow do I transact?\u201d Daniel Alegre, Google\u2019s president for retail and shopping, told Reuters exclusively.  Over the past two years, mobile searches asking where to buy products soared by 85 percent, Alegre said.  But the current default choice for many consumers is a Google search that ends with an Amazon purchase, analysts said. The new Google program, Shopping Actions, will be available in the United States to retailers of all sizes and could help retail chains keep those customers.  \u201cWe have taken a fundamentally different approach from the likes of Amazon because we see ourselves as an enabler of retail,\u201d Alegre said. \u201cWe see ourselves as part of a solution for retailers to be able to drive better transactions ... and get closer to the consumer.\u201d  For consumers faced with a surfeit of choices, the idea is to make online buying easier by giving them a single shopping cart and instant checkout \u2013 a core feature of Amazon\u2019s retail dominance.  Retail chains can also offer products through the Google Home voice shopping device, holding on to those who may be headed to Amazon for better deals and giving them personalized recommendations based on previous purchase history.  For example, a shopper looking for sneakers on Google on his phone can see a retailer\u2019s listing and add that to his Google Express cart. Later, the customer can stand in the kitchen, and use the Google Home voice device to add paper towels to the same cart and buy everything at once.  Retail partners saw the average size of a customer\u2019s shopping basket increase by 30 percent, Alegre said, pointing to early results from the Shopping Actions program.  Ulta Beauty\u2019s average order value has jumped 35 percent since partnering with Google, Chief Executive Officer Mary Dillon said. Ulta sells makeup and skin care products from brands such as MAC, Estee Lauder and Clinique.  Over the past six months, Target said the number of items in shoppers\u2019 Google Express baskets have increased by nearly 20 percent, on average, as a result of its tie-up with the internet company.  ENEMY OF MY ENEMY IS MY FRIEND  The retailers are also eager to get in on the rapidly growing voice shopping market dominated by Amazon\u2019s popular Echo home device, analysts and consultants said.  Both Walmart and Target last year struck deals to appear in search results via Google Home.  Smart voice devices like Amazon Echo and Google Home will be installed in 55 percent of U.S. households by 2022, according to Juniper Research. Amazon\u2019s Alexa platform could generate $10 billion in revenues by 2020, a separate report from RBC Capital Markets estimated.  \u201cBrands are looking at Google as the enemy of the enemy and that makes Google their friend,\u201d said Guru Hariharan, CEO of retail technology firm Boomerang Commerce, referring to the competition between Amazon and chains like Walmart and Target.  Target shoppers \u201clove the ease and convenience of making their Target run without lifting a finger by using a voice interface,\u201d Chief Information and Digital Officer Mike McNamara said.  \u201cThis is just the beginning for Target and Google,\u201d he added.  Target shoppers will soon be able to link their online account and loyalty card with their Google accounts and get 5 percent off on purchases and free shipping, McNamara said.

Yet Google almost pulled it off in just under seven years.  On March 5, nine-year-old restaurant guide Infatuation announced it was buying the Zagat brand for an undisclosed amount. The company\u2014best known for its #eeeeeats hashtag\u2014now controls the 35-year-old Zagat name and its international catalog of reviews.  For some, the question isn\u2019t why Google sold off Zagat; it\u2019s what took so long. The relationship between the two companies had been troubled for years. The 2011 purchase was championed by former Google executive Marissa Mayer, who saw Zagat as an asset for the maps division she controlled. But by 2013, some reviewers panned the release of the Zagat app, which had a difficult user interface and seemed designed to push content such as \u201cRose for Every Mood: What to Bring to Any Summer Occasion,\u201d rather than help people find a good place to eat.    Then, a few years ago, Google chose to infuse its mapping services with features such as user-generated restaurant reviews, rather than leveraging Zagat and its resources. It was a defensive move to ward off rivals such as Yelp Inc. and Apple Inc., which were then credible threats to Google\u2019s dominance in local information. Zagat, meanwhile, was left to wither.  The end of an era.  How did this happen? When Mayer departed in 2012, Zagat was left without a champion at Google, according to a former Zagat contractor who requested anonymity. Instead of hiring additional full-time staff, Google relied on contractors for content and assigned a minimal number of engineers for such major projects as the app launch and a 2017 web redesign, according to several people who worked for Zagat at the time. Gradually, the number of contractors working on Zagat content decreased\u2014there were just over a dozen to cover the globe\u2014and coverage of notable cities such as London and Toronto was suspended.  Google declined a request for comment.  Eventually, the staff was told to de-emphasize reviews, which were the backbone of the business. Instead, employees were directed to focus on boilerplate guide lists, such as \u201cBest Brunch\u201d and \u201cBest After Work Drinks.\u201d The changes left the remaining staff frustrated, according to the former contractor.  Tim and Nina Zagat founded their eponymous guide as a hobby in 1979. The couple, having met at Yale Law School, started the business after a guest criticized a newspaper\u2019s restaurant reviews at a dinner party. The Zagats began soliciting friends\u2019 opinions and found 200 amateur critics to rate 100 restaurants for food, d\u00e9cor, service, and costs. An empire was born. For years, the Zagat guide was part of the calculus of figuring out where you were going to eat.    Those days are long gone. By 2017, Zagat failed even to send out its annual survey\u2014the basis for its restaurant rankings. No guide was produced, and no explanation was given.  Flashback. Photographer: Paul Taggart  Zagat freelancers weren\u2019t notified of the Infatuation deal beforehand, according to a current contractor who requested anonymity. Instead, they were told on Friday night that security was being updated and that they would be locked out of Zagat tools, the contractor says. By Monday morning, they were given the press release.    Infatuation didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. In a statement, the site said it will operate Zagat as a separate brand, with a new, tech-driven platform that will be an alternative to other crowdsourced restaurant reviews.  In October, Google held its second Local Guides Summit in San Francisco. The program encourages users of the company\u2019s Maps app to upload photos and write reviews of places such as restaurants and to submit new locations. During the summit, Google announced that 50 million people were contributing to the program, a 1,000 percent increase from the 5 million it tracked in early 2016. More than 700,000 venues are being added to Maps each month, according to the company. Maps has more than 1 billion users, making it a lot more efficient and broader than Zagat\u2019s restaurant-review system.  \u201cI assume Google figured out that they didn\u2019t need the brand name in order to surface the information,\u201d said restaurateur Nick Kokonas, whose Alinea dining room topped the list in the 2012 Chicago Zagat guide. \u201cAt the end of the day, Google can get all that Zagat information without actually owning Zagat, right?\u201d  \u2014 With assistance by Mark Bergen", "stock": "GOOGL"}, {"url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-15/google-buys-xively-to-expand-in-the-market-for-connected-devices", "label": 1, "source": "bloomberg", "date": "2018-02-15", "article": "Google said it plans to acquire Xively, a unit of LogMeIn Inc., in a bid to capture sales from businesses that manage a growing number of devices connected to the internet.

Publishers will keep 85 percent to 95 percent of revenue when readers first buy subscriptions via Google, up from 70 percent previously, according to people with knowledge of the matter.  Publishers\u2019 feelings toward Silicon Valley are starting to shift as some technology companies are showing they want to compete for content. Last week, Apple Inc. offered an olive branch to the media industry by buying Texture, a digital service that lets users subscribe to more than 200 magazines for $9.99 a month. Apple and Google are trying to seize on a moment when Facebook\u2019s ties with news outlets have soured.  The relationship between news providers and \u201cthe major digital platforms -- how they think about content, how they think about publishers, how they think about data -- feels more in flux right now than it has in a long time,\u201d Mark Thompson, chief executive officer of the New York Times Co., said in an interview.  The new financial terms are part of \u201cSubscribe with Google,\u201d a feature that gives media companies data and tools to find and keep subscribers. It was one of several announcements the search giant made in New York on Tuesday to appease publishers whose content helps Google sell advertising.  \"Our mission is inherently tied to your mission,\" Philipp Schindler, Google\u2019s chief business officer, told a room of media executives.  Subscriber Tool  When consumers sign up for a subscription using \u201cSubscribe with Google\u201d at a publisher\u2019s website, Google will keep just 5 percent of the revenue, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing nonpublic information. If they use the tool at the Google Play Store, that goes up to 15 percent.  On Tuesday, Google said it would share data to help identify potential paying readers and that users\u2019 search results would more prominently feature publications they subscribe to. The company also said it would dole out $300 million to support digital journalism globally over the next three years.  \u201cWe welcome the fact that Google has listened to and responded to some of our asks about our subscription business,\u201d Thompson said. He also said he\u2019d like to see Google and others share advertising revenue with publishers, since the tech companies make big profits by selling online ads around other providers\u2019 news content.  \u201cAny kind of comprehensive solution to do with sustaining quality journalism on these major platforms will have to consider the advertising side of the equation as well,\u201d Thompson said.  Boost Relations  Apple\u2019s purchase of Texture last week was that company\u2019s latest effort to boost relations with news outlets. Apple once touted the iPad as a potential savior for the industry, which has struggled for years with declining subscribers and print advertising. In 2011, News Corp. created an iPad-only newspaper called The Daily, but shut it down in less than two years after failing to find a big enough audience.  Conde Nast President Bob Sauerberg said he\u2019s optimistic Apple\u2019s acquisition will start a new chapter that will benefit his stable of glossy magazines, which include Wired and The New Yorker. Conde Nast was a co-owner of Texture.  \u201cThey have big ambitions,\u201d Sauerberg said.  Sauerberg said not all tech giants have put publishers at the top of their priority lists, but for now, \u201cI feel really good we\u2019re at the top of the list for Apple and for Google.\u201d  IPhone App  Apple\u2019s focus with publishers has been on distributing their stories on Apple News, an app that comes installed on millions of iPhones. Media executives say Apple News could be a significant source of online readership. But so far they\u2019ve seen little money from it.  Apple News is a way to attract more Times readers, especially outside the U.S., \u201cbut without significant economics attached,\u201d Thompson said. The Times distributes articles on Apple News, but is not participating in the subscription program.  Facebook, meanwhile, has sent mixed signals to publishers. In October, the world\u2019s largest social network began a test to support paywalls in Instant Articles and letting publishers keep all the revenue from subscriptions. In February, it launched a three-month pilot program to help local newspapers attract more subscribers.  But the company has also said its algorithm will start prioritizing News Feed posts from friends and families, hurting publishers\u2019 web traffic.  \u201cGoogle has been the most responsive of the major platforms in terms of listening, trying to understand what we need, and changing their business rules,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cWe\u2019ve not seen that kind of responsiveness from Facebook at all, actually.\u201d  \u2014 With assistance by Mark Gurman", "stock": "GOOGL"}, {"url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-02/google-shakes-up-management-at-top-of-powerful-search-ai-units", "label": 0, "source": "bloomberg", "date": "2018-04-02", "article": "John Giannandrea, the head of Google\u2019s cornerstone web-search unit, is stepping down from his role.

The end-goal is to grow this group to a size similar to Google\u2019s existing team of 120 engineers who do applied research in Paris, working on developments for Chrome and YouTube, a company spokeswoman said.  Facebook, which already has an artificial intelligence lab in Paris, said it will double the team there to 100 people by 2022 and spend 10 million euros ($12.2 million) on items including hardware equipment. Both announcements came as part of a broader series of promises by these companies to increase budgets in France, with Google and Facebook also separately vowing to train citizens on digital tools.  \u201cFrance has all the assets to succeed. It has top engineers, great  entrepreneurs, one of the best education systems in the world, great infrastructure, and successful global companies,\u201d Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai wrote in a blog post. He reaffirmed a broader hiring target to reach 1,000 employees at Google\u2019s headquarters in the French capital, from 700 today.  Pichai and Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg are guests of Macron\u2019s on Monday, among 140 top executives from a variety of industries. In Versailles, company chiefs were invited to attend presentations by ministers, as well as private meetings and dinner with the president -- a full-fledged investor roadshow meant to convince CEOs to invest more in France, as they prepare to head to Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum.  SAP SE CEO Bill McDermott is also on the guest list. Europe\u2019s biggest software company said it will invest 2 billion euros over five years in France on research and development, as well as backing and acquiring startups.  SAP also announced Monday it\u2019s buying a French company called Recast.AI that specializes in artificial intelligence. Recast.AI, which develops conversational chatbots, will be part of SAP\u2019s efforts to add voice recognition to its products.  Macron\u2019s strategy to woo investors and bring more funds to the French ecosystem dates back before his days as president, and tech has always been at the core of it. When he was still economy minister two years ago, Macron used the grandeur of Versailles to try and convince technology-focused venture-capitalists, including Andreessen Horowitz and Accel Partners, that France is a good place for their money.  The French president has also expressed the goal of establishing France and Europe as leaders in global artificial intelligence innovation, to rival the U.S. and China. France is waiting for a report by member of Parliament, Cedric Villani, expected soon, before it unveils a national strategy on AI.  Still, Macron has toughened his stance on technology companies in recent months on issues like taxes. He brought it up with Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook during a meeting at the French presidential palace in September.  Taxation of tech companies will be part of talks in Versailles Monday, but they\u2019re not the reason for Macron\u2019s meetings with Pichai, Sandberg and others, according to an official at the president\u2019s office.

The deal will help Google design more of its own consumer hardware and could set it up to wade deeper into special-purpose chips -- like Apple. Google\u2019s most recent Pixel model came with a new image processor to improve the device\u2019s camera. More of this \"custom silicon\" will come in the future, Google\u2019s hardware chief Rick Osterloh said in an interview.  Osterloh brought in HTC engineers and designers to help Google control more of the design and production of its products, including working more closely with suppliers. Google previously focused on software and let manufacturers including Samsung Electronics Co. and HTC handle the hardware. But modern phones offer features like augmented reality and artificial intelligence-based services that require close integration of software and hardware.  \"You have to be vertical in some cases to really push the envelope for consumers,\" Osterloh said. \"Our intention is to invest in this for the long term. You\u2019ll see a steady increase in investment from us.\"  HTC said in a separate statement that it plans to proceed with its next flagship smartphone and will focus its efforts in the segment. \u201cToday marks the beginning of an exciting new chapter at HTC as we continue to drive innovation in our branded smartphone and VIVE virtual reality businesses,\u201d Cher Wang, chairwoman at HTC said in the statement.  For Google, a bigger step would be to create its own \"system-on-a-chip\" -- the main processors inside phones that Apple now inserts into its devices. Qualcomm Inc. provides the bulk of these chips to Android phone makers, and Osterloh said Google will keep working with the supplier for the foreseeable future.  Still, by designing more silicon itself, Google could cut business for other suppliers. Apple released its first system-on-a-chip in 2010, and has added special chips to store fingerprint and payment data, track motion, crunch graphics and run AI algorithms on mobile devices.  Google\u2019s Pixel sales have been a fraction of Apple\u2019s, but another phone maker designing more of its own components is a bad sign for suppliers. Dialog Semiconductor Plc slumped last month after telling investors that Apple, its biggest customer, could design its own power-management chips. Imagination Technologies Group Plc suffered a similar fate last year after Apple stopped buying the U.K. company\u2019s graphics chips in favor of in-house designs.  The HTC deal is also bad news for manufacturers of phones based on Google\u2019s Android operating system. Most of these companies have struggled to make money selling premium handsets that compete with the iPhone, while Google benefited from distributing search and other lucrative software services on those devices. Now Google is making its own high-end smartphones. The Pixel phone sold 1.5 million phones in 2017, up from 1 million the year before, according to Counterpoint Research. By contrast, Samsung is estimated to have shipped more than 300 million smartphone units last year.  If Android partners aren\u2019t alienated by Google\u2019s entrance, they are at least uneasy. After the Pixel arrived, some major Android manufacturers, like Samsung and Huawei Technologies Co., began to roll out more of their own services on their phones.  Other Android manufacturers \"know why we\u2019re doing this,\" Osterloh said. \"Quite honestly, Apple is doing really well in developed markets.\"  After the HTC deal, Google plans to expand research and marketing, cut deals with more phone carriers and retailers, and move into new markets. Sales remain limited to nine countries, including the U.S., Germany and Singapore.  \"China is obviously a very attractive smartphone market and we\u2019re certainly interested in going back to China in the future, but we don\u2019t have any plans to discuss and frankly it\u2019s complicated for the company,\" he said. Google pulled its services from mainland China in 2010 after refusing to censor its search results.  If Google\u2019s push into smartphones sounds familiar, that\u2019s because the latest deal echoes Google\u2019s $12.5 billion acquisition of Motorola Mobility in 2012. That experiment flopped. Google never integrated the business and sold most of it to Lenovo Group Ltd. for $2.91 billion. In a blog post, Alphabet CEO Larry Page said Motorola would be better off with a company that\u2019s \"all-in when it comes to making mobile devices.\"  Osterloh knows the history well.

Google\u2019s firing of an engineer over his controversial memo criticizing its diversity policies and \u201cpolitically correct monoculture\u201d didn\u2019t violate U.S. labor law, a federal agency lawyer concluded.  Statements in James Damore\u2019s 3,000-word memo \u201cregarding biological differences between the sexes were so harmful, discriminatory, and disruptive\u201d that they fell outside protections for collective action in the workplace, an associate general counsel for the National Labor Relations Board wrote in a six-page memo disclosed Thursday.  Damore withdrew his complaint in January and his lawyer has said she\u2019s focusing instead on the engineer\u2019s lawsuit accusing the internet giant of harassing him and others over their conservative political views.  When he was dismissed in August, Damore accused Google of violating the employee right to engage in \"concerted activity\" to address workplace issues, a category which the labor board has found can include forms of activism ranging from lawsuits to strikes to social media posts.  \u201cMuch of\" Damore\u2019s memo was probably protected under the law, the labor board\u2019s attorney, Jayme Sophir, said in the Jan. 16 memo. But Sophir went on to find that Google discharged Damore only for his \"discriminatory statements,\" which aren\u2019t shielded by labor law.  Because companies have a duty to comply with equal employment laws and an interest in promoting diversity, \u201cemployers must be permitted to \u2018nip in the bud\u2019 the kinds of employee conduct that could lead to a \u2018hostile workplace,\u2019 rather than waiting until an actionable hostile workplace has been created before taking action,\" Sophir wrote.  The company \u201ccarefully tailored\" its messages in firing Damore and in addressing employees afterward \"to affirm their right to engage in protected speech while prohibiting discrimination or harassment.\" Google also disciplined one of Damore\u2019s co-workers for sending him a threatening email in response to the memo, Sophir said.  Fired Google Engineer Faces Headwinds Seeking Legal Recourse  Google declined to comment on Sophir\u2019s memo. Damore\u2019s attorney didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.  The labor board lawyer\u2019s conclusion is \"consistent with board precedent for decades, which has viewed speech which creates a hostile environment likely to produce both discord and divisiveness as unprotected,\" said William Gould IV, who chaired the board under President Bill Clinton.  \"In the course of protesting working conditions you can be profane and aggressive and unpleasant, you can be militant, and it\u2019s still protected,\" Gould said.

The big question is whether investors are overestimating the companies' ability to keep expanding their dominance.  The Alphabet Inc. unit and Facebook Inc. pulled in a combined $114 billion in revenue from advertisements in 2017, excluding the money that Google turns over to partners such as Apple. That means more than one out of every five dollars in the $500 billion global advertising market goes to Google and Facebook, based on Magna Global estimates of worldwide ad spending. Excluding advertising sales in China, where neither company has made much headway, Google and Facebook are responsible for about 25 percent of annual advertising revenue.  That's impressive, right? The companies grew into beasts because they changed how businesses from Ford to the corner coffee shop pitched to their customers. The local Yellow Pages, newspapers and magazines all lost advertising sales to varying degrees to Google and Facebook, which offered businesses a more efficient and effective way to persuade people to buy pickup trucks or drop by the store. In 2017, about 40 percent of all global advertising revenue was spent online, up from 20 percent six years earlier, the Magna estimates show. Google and Facebook led that shift and benefited from it more than any other companies.  Ad Assault Google and Facebook's combined advertising revenue is equivalent to 22 percent of the global ad market Data: Magna Global, Bloomberg Intelligence and company disclosures; graphic by Bloomberg Gadfly  But it gets harder for Google and Facebook from here, and it's not clear that the companies' stock market values reflect the difficulties of their mission. Both companies need to continue to grab advertising from television, radio and other places where businesses try to reach customers and expand into areas other than what is considered conventional consumer advertising. I'm more sanguine about the former than the latter.  First, I'll tackle the companies' market share task. The Magna data show that global advertising spending has increased an average of less than 5 percent annually since 2011, a bit faster than the expansion of the global economy over that period. Google and Facebook ad revenue has grown much faster -- 18 percent and 49 percent in 2017, respectively. In other words, the growth of Google and Facebook hasn't come so much from an increase in the total advertising pie but from grabbing bigger slices from other media.  To keep growing, Google and Facebook need to continue to expand their market share of the advertising pie. That's one reason why Google and Facebook are each trying to encroach on the turf of television, the source of $175 billion in annual advertising spending worldwide. But increasing their ad market share isn't enough.  Let's assume Google and Facebook expand their share of global advertising revenue excluding China to 40 percent in 2022 from the current 25 percent. That would work out to an estimated $216 billion in combined advertising revenue for Google and Facebook, based on Magna's ad market forecasts. That's a 14 percent compound annual growth rate for the companies, which would be a significant deceleration. Google and Facebook's combined advertising sales have grown 22 percent to 28 percent a year since 2014.  Advertising Royalty Google and Facebook's ad sales are growing much more quickly than the total advertising market. Growth rates for each: Data: Company disclosures and Magna Global via Bloomberg Intelligence; graphic by Bloomberg Gadfly  To grow at the rate investors expect, then, Google and Facebook need \"moonshots.\" I'm not necessarily talking about autonomous cars, technology to let people hear through their skin and other projects the companies are cooking up in their science labs. Google and Facebook need moonshots in their primary business of advertising, too.  That could mean expanding into what is thought of as marketing, such as the email messages and coupons that companies pay to send to their customers. It could be selling software used by marketing departments, as Adobe and Salesforce provide now. Or Google and Facebook could find ways to take a slice of revenue when they refer people to buy from local merchants. Those are all ways Google and Facebook could tap large pools of revenue outside of but adjacent to their core advertising businesses.  It's possible each company could continue to thrive just by sticking to advertising. The companies have grabbed more ad market share than many people expected, and that could continue. Both companies are also trying to diversify into non-ad areas such as virtual reality and cloud computing.  For the foreseeable future, though, Google and Facebook are reliant on advertising. Alphabet generates 86 percent of its revenue from advertising; at Facebook the figure is 98 percent. The companies may be running out of room to grow before they hit a ceiling in advertising. And that may flip their iron grip on advertising from a strength to a vulnerability.

Columbus actually wanted to find a faster way to India and discovered America. The situation is similar for a German asset manager in the 21st century. For years, he has been trading successfully on the basis of an options strategy. Then he asks his IT administrator to test new strategies. Unplanned they develop an artificial intelligence that has recently become the manager of a new fund by the company.  The Frankfurt based asset manager Wallrich Wolf Asset Management AG has been in business with their short-options-fund for ten years. The portfolio managers regularly sell put options and earn the option premium. Until 2011 the fund was fully invested most of the time, which provided steady income, but did not allow scope for new positions when volatility increased.  Managing director Stefan Wallrich was keen to know, what strategies and optimizations work and asked his IT administrator, who is actually responsible for the maintenance of computers and servers, to support him in a so-called backtest. A backtest is a common practice in portfolio management to try new ideas or optimize existing ones. 20 strategies were calculated by Wallrich back to the year 2008. Among other things, this showed that, in principle, a variable degree of exposure in the portfolio, depending on the current market volatility, produces good results.  \"Until then, I was happy with the results, because I just wanted to backtest some strategies to optimize our existing fund,\" says Wallrich, who manages more than 350 million euros ($427 million) with his team in various portfolios. But then came the big \"enlightment\".  Which degree of investment is the right one? Wallrich\u2019s IT expert Marcel Heintz developed an artificial intelligence that constantly calculates different investment levels, checks them and questions the results. The machine is given the requirement to keep a portion of the portfolio permanently invested in order to generate regular income through the option sale and at the same time, depending on the level of volatility, to move the investment level up or down. With low volatility, less investment should be made and, with high volatility and thus high premiums, even more than 100 percent of the portfolio should be invested. Otherwise the machine is free to decided on the degree of investment by itself.  \"The AI \u200b\u200bconstantly assesses its results and questions how it came to the conclusion and how it can do even better in the future,\" explains Sebastian Franz, who was involved in the development as a DHBW-student.  Artificial intelligence technology differs from the more traditional quant investment approch, in that it mimics the human brain\u2019s learning capacity. When new data comes in, the algorithm modifies its behavior. A machine detects non-linear patterns, without the help of a human being.  More about AI with asset managers:  This AI-Robot Picks Stocks Based on Millions of Human Emotions  \u2019Warren in a Box\u2019 Picks Stocks for First Nordic AI Fund  QuickTake: Artificial Intelligence  After a year of research and convincing results, Wallrich decides to give it a try and in December 2017 launches a new fund, which is managed only by the AI.  \"We could have used the computer in our traditional strategy, but in order to give the topic the attention it deserves, we decided to launch a new fund,\" says Wallrich. \"Also to distinguish the AI from the old fund and to be able to evaluate the success in the long term.\"  The fund currently manages 7 million euros ($8.5 million) and, like most AI funds, is still at the beginning. For Wallrich, the AI topic is not a revolution, but an evolution, and he wants to further improve the \"intelligence factor\" in the coming months.  New Intelligence AI funds are still young but already manage millions Source: Bloomberg  For example, one could extend the AI \u200b\u200bby additional volatility variables or check how exchange rates or macroeconomic data change the decision path of the machine. In addition, it would be possible to launch several funds with basically the same strategy but different risk-return profiles. With the AI \u200b\u200bit is possible to manage several different portfolios cost-effectively and with less highly qualified portfolio managers.  In 2018 he aims for a fund volume of 15 million euros. In the medium term, \"it can and should become significantly more,\" says Wallrich. However, that depends on the success of the AI \u200b\u200bstrategy. \"If it works, of which I\u2019m very confident, the volume could sky rocket.\"  One has to go with the time and competition makes it necessary to stay innovative, Wallrich says. He could think of abandoning the classic portfolio management completely at some point and leave the money management fully to the machine. \"The machine is simply better at many things, while we have emotional discussions in our portfolio management team,\" Wallrich says.

Google co-founder Larry Page and futurist Ray Kurzweil could be among your lecturers in the Graduate Studies Program at Singularity, named for the notion that humans will someday merge with machines. You\u2019d work in a kind of combination think tank and startup incubator, trying to address challenges as grand as renewable energy and space travel. Kurzweil announced the program during a TED Talk in 2009, adding that the Singularity team had leased its campus from NASA, just east of the agency\u2019s historic Hangar One in Mountain View, Calif. The team received 1,200 applications for its first class of 40 later that year.  Reality hasn\u2019t matched the hype. Previously unreported police files, other documents, and interviews with current and former students and staff paint the picture that almost from the beginning, some Singularity staffers weren\u2019t able to curb their worst impulses. A teacher allegedly sexually assaulted a former student, an executive stole more than $15,000, a former staffer alleges gender and disability discrimination, and Singularity dismissed 14 of about 170 staffers and suspended GSP, now called the Global Solutions Program, after Google withdrew funding last year.  Alumni say for-profit Singularity is becoming just another organizer of conferences and executive seminars. It\u2019s weighing buying the seminar company Abundance 360, started by Singularity co-founder Peter Diamandis. \u201cIt\u2019s lost its soul,\u201d says Vivek Wadhwa, who ran the faculty until 2013 and is at Carnegie Mellon University. \u201cIt\u2019s become a moneymaking corporation.\u201d  \u201cIf we want to make true impact \u2026 we need to do it in a sustainable fashion\u201d  While Singularity says it takes seriously its community\u2019s security and any related allegations, most of those matters are far in the past, says Chief Executive Officer Rob Nail. He says he was already planning to suspend and reevaluate GSP before Google ended its annual grant of $1.5 million. The grant covered about half the costs of the program, which was free for participants. Google, whose senior manager Jen Phillips left Singularity\u2019s advisory board late last year and won\u2019t be replaced, says it plans to focus on Singularity\u2019s entrepreneurship programs instead.  Nail says although GSP may be reborn largely online, conferences and executive education (tuition: $14,500 for a weeklong program) will become the bulk of Singularity\u2019s work. It held 10 conferences last year and has 18 planned for 2018. On Feb. 15 it announced it raised $32 million in venture funding led by Boeing Co. and investment firm WestRiver Group. Erik Anderson, WestRiver\u2019s CEO, is replacing Diamandis as Singularity\u2019s chairman. These changes, Nail says, will help the company turn a profit and thereby aid more people. \u201cIf we want to make true impact,\u201d he says, \u201cwe need to do it in a sustainable fashion.\u201d  Singularity had NASA connections beyond its rented buildings. Early GSP students speak highly of a lecture by former astronaut Dan Barry, a physician who got into the space shuttle program after 13 rejections. Several say they saw him as a mentor. Barry hasn\u2019t taught GSP students since 2013, when the company investigated him for allegedly sexually assaulting Yasemin Baydaroglu, a French student who attended GSP in 2011.  Baydaroglu says Barry arranged a 2013 meetup in Paris. They went for a bike ride, during which she complained of back pain, and then went to his hotel to chat. He reminded her he was a doctor, she says, and offered her a massage, speaking in strictly medical terms. Because he was a mentor, she trusted him\u2014until, she says, he touched her breasts and genitals, and she fled. \u201cI really didn\u2019t see it coming, and I\u2019m so careful,\u201d she says. \u201cThis time my guard was low.\u201d She reported the incident to police several days later, then visited a doctor.  \u201cI completely deny her accusations,\u201d Barry says, adding that the inquiries that followed led to \u201ca distressing time for me and my wife.\u201d  Baydaroglu showed signs of psychological distress that she said were linked to a physical assault, according to a copy of a May 31, 2013, doctor\u2019s report reviewed by Bloomberg Businessweek. According to a copy of a letter sent from France\u2019s Office of the Prosecutor, it declined to pursue the case because authorities hadn\u2019t been able to find Barry.  Singularity began its internal investigation after Baydaroglu separately reported the alleged assault to the company. Barry left that summer\u2019s program in June; his wife was ill, and the company told students he left for personal reasons. In a June 22, 2013, email to Baydaroglu reviewed by Bloomberg Businessweek, a Singularity human resources official told her Nail believed \u201cthe facts around the central allegation of unwanted sexual touching are inconclusive\u201d but that he told Barry the circumstances indicated \u201cpoor judgment.\u201d The official wrote that Barry wouldn\u2019t be present for the remainder of the 2013 GSP and asked Baydaroglu not to discuss the matter with other parties.  \u201cWe respectfully request that within the SU community, you keep our discussions and this conclusion confidential,\u201d the HR official wrote. She added that Baydaroglu shouldn\u2019t allow the company\u2019s investigation to influence her decision about civil or criminal legal processes, and offered company support for services such as counseling.  The email outlined steps Singularity was taking to reduce the likelihood of staffers being in \u201cpotentially intimate situations\u201d on campus, including prohibiting them from being alone with a student at the end of a program day and installing webcams to monitor classrooms. Baydaroglu says Singularity\u2019s response left her feeling deeply depressed and betrayed. Particularly galling, she says, was \u201casking me not to talk about it.\u201d The company declined to discuss the case except to say Barry hasn\u2019t been an active faculty member since 2013.  Singularity leaders have a history of shady financial practices. When the organization was in its infancy in 2009, Alicia Isaac, the financial controller, used its credit cards to make $13,500 in personal purchases; she also kept the cash from a $2,000 check to Singularity, according to a subsequent police report. And she helped the president of an artificial intelligence institute try to steal almost $80,000. Police arrested Isaac in 2009; she pleaded no contest to felony fraud charges. Isaac didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.  Another early Singularity architect, Bruce Klein, was convicted in 2012 of running a credit fraud operation in Alabama. He\u2019s no longer associated with the company. Board member Naveen Jain was convicted of insider trading in 2003. He appealed a $247 million judgment and ultimately settled.  Nail, who previously helped found an automation company, arrived in late 2011 with Chief Strategy Officer Gabriel Baldinucci, a former Virgin Group executive. They soon changed Singularity from a nonprofit to a for-profit B Corporation, which means a private accreditor certifies it meets certain social and environmental standards.  For years several staffers close to Baldinucci lived alongside him in a series of rented houses nicknamed the SU Villa, in Atherton and Woodside, Calif. Other employees say the group got favorable treatment and the general atmosphere was unfriendly to women. Eleanor Schuermann, a lawyer at Kastner Kim LLP, is representing a staffer who alleges Singularity discriminated against her because of her gender and disability, paid her less than men in the same position, and retaliated against her for complaining. The attorney\u2019s filings with state regulators, the first steps toward a lawsuit, aren\u2019t yet public record. Schuermann, who wouldn\u2019t name her client, says she\u2019s heard from two other Singularity employees about similar claims. The company declined to comment on the case but says it works hard to support women.  Singularity is a long way from 2009, when the first GSP led to the creation of Getaround, a car-sharing company that\u2019s raised $85 million from investors including Toyota Motor Corp. \u201cIt is amazing what all has happened here,\u201d Google\u2019s Page said during the program\u2019s opening ceremony the following year. \u201cIt exceeded all my expectations.\u201d These days, Page isn\u2019t involved with Singularity. Kurzweil doesn\u2019t dispute that while he attends board meetings, he rarely speaks.  Anderson, the new chairman, says the company expects to meet its revenue and social goals. Nail says it\u2019s making good on some of its grander ambitions, citing work on United Nations anti-hunger efforts. Still, he says, Singularity can do better: \u201cWe\u2019re nowhere near impacting the billion people our students talk about.\u201d", "stock": "GOOGL"}, {"url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-03-05/harmeet-dhillon-wants-silicon-valley-to-be-safe-for-conservatives", "label": 1, "source": "bloomberg", "date": "2018-03-05", "article": "On a recent night in San Francisco, the woman representing the Google engineer famously fired for arguing women aren\u2019t genetically suited to work in tech doesn\u2019t have it in her to attend a dinner of her peers. Those peers\u2014other San Francisco judges and attorneys\u2014run the spectrum, in her view, from liberal to far lefty. The sort of people she\u2019s surrounded by and specializes in riling up. But it can be exhausting.  \u201cIf I go today, I\u2019ll be devoured by judges and attorneys asking me how I could represent James,\u201d Harmeet Dhillon says of the annual bar association dinner. This was in January, months after her new client, James Damore, became an inescapable flashpoint in the workplace-gender war. Dhillon had just finished an interview on Fox News, where she makes regular appearances. She ditched the dinner and sat down for another interview instead.  Dhillon is a Republican in the People\u2019s Republic of Northern California. She\u2019s an outspoken supporter of President Donald Trump, and one of three elected leaders of the state\u2019s Republican National Committee.  She\u2019s a free-speech lawyer who argues the University of California at Berkeley stifled the First Amendment when it bumped a speech by conservative Ann Coulter. She doesn\u2019t believe in fake-news conspiracies and, in an appearance on Fox News, has denounced Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation as \u201cabsolutely\u201d corrupt. \u201cI didn\u2019t say Mueller was corrupt. But the investigation itself, it appears to be corrupt on many levels.\u201d  \u201cShe\u2019s a person of some dichotomy. On the one hand, she was on the board of the ACLU and fights for many individual rights,\u201d says Neel Chatterjee, a San Francisco lawyer who\u2019s known Dhillon since the 1980s. \u201cOn the other hand, she\u2019s a staunch Republican Trump supporter.\u201d And as Chatterjee notes: \u201cShe likes fighting political fights.\u201d  \u201cWhen Harmeet decided to lend her voice to the Trump campaign, there were, especially in the South Asian community, a lot of people who really questioned her integrity and her good faith,\u201d says Paul Grewal, a childhood friend and Facebook Inc.\u2019s general counsel. \u201cShe made very clear in the toughest moments of that campaign that what she was standing up for were her own conservative ideals.\u201d  In the legal complaint against Google, Harmeet Dhillon positions her client, James Damore, as someone in her own mold\u2014a conservative in a liberal bubble defending his rights. Photographer: Michael Liedtke/AP  Dhillon, 49, is in America\u2019s progressive hub summoning her own life experience to craft a novel legal argument that posits Damore in her own mold: a conservative in a liberal bubble demanding and using free-speech rights.  Dhillon won\u2019t say whether she agrees with her client\u2019s 3,000-word manifesto, the one Damore used to blast Google\u2019s diversity policies before he was fired. In it he asserts, among other things, that biological variances are a likely explanation for Silicon Valley\u2019s lopsided gender gap. But Dhillon does agree that Google\u2019s work culture crushes conservative ideology while promoting a liberal echo chamber. That ethos, she argues, is ultimately what fueled her client\u2019s termination.  Central to her case are a pair of 81-year-old sections of California\u2019s Labor Code that prohibit employers from controlling employees\u2019 political expression at work or firing them because of it. Where the U.S. Constitution\u2019s First Amendment ends, says Dhillon, California\u2019s statute begins.  Dhillon argues that Google\u2019s work culture changed in November 2016, after Trump\u2019s electoral victory. Within days the reality of his victory set in, and many Google employees were in a panic, \u201chaving expected a different outcome fully in line with their political views,\u201d Dhillon wrote in the 161-page complaint. The document mentions Trump nine times and uses the word \u201cconservative\u201d 101 times.  The lawsuit appears designed to maximally embarrass one of the world\u2019s biggest companies. One section of her complaint\u2014under the heading \u201cGoogle Failed to Protect Employees from Workplace Harassment Due to Their Support for President Trump\u201d\u2014decries unnamed managers for sabotaging the careers of conservative employees while promoting like-minded progressives, and in another instance, Google employees allegedly encouraged \u201cunambiguous social pecking\u201d of conservative white men. Later, she accuses Google of welcoming a diverse realm of alternative lifestyles on its internal message boards, including mailing lists for employees identifying sexually as \u201cyellow-scaled wingless dragonkin.\u201d But, she notes, the tech giant neglected to create or encourage such a venue for \u201ctraditional monogamy.\u201d  Dhillon says she\u2019s the advocate for a true underdog here. While Google welcomes the \u201cfurries and transgender,\u201d she says, conservative men are blacklisted. Among the loudest voices demanding social equality for conservative white males is, of course, President Trump.  Her approach to equality in Silicon Valley is an obvious deviation from the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements that have dominated social media in tandem with growing calls for gender equality for women in tech, Hollywood and elsewhere. In fact, while Dhillon sues Google for plotting to hire and promote women instead of men, the U.S. Department of Labor has filed suit against the company for quite the opposite: not hiring enough women.  Dhillon describes them as two different problems. Finding more women in the industry is a pipeline challenge. So long as American universities are churning out four male tech candidates for every one woman, she says, the supply issue can\u2019t be solved. To achieve balance in Silicon Valley, employers cannot stop hiring men: \u201cThat\u2019s not legal.\u201d  Harmeet Dhillon offered a Sikh prayer to open the second day of the 2016 Republican National Convention. Photographer: John Taggart/Bloomberg  Her ideals were born out of her tiny hometown in rural North Carolina, at her dinner table where her devout parents taught her about tort reform, taxation and what it meant to be an immigrant in Jimmy Carter\u2019s America. Coming from India\u2019s socialized democracy in the 1970s, when Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was on the cusp of temporarily suspending the nation\u2019s constitution, the idea of intense government intervention and regulation didn\u2019t resonate with the tax-averse, gun-holding Dhillon family. They fled India for the United Kingdom, then to America\u2019s promise of free-market capitalism, only to be miffed by the Carter administration\u2019s tax rates on capital gains. Discussions often centered on the U.S. gas shortage, flaws in socialism, foreign policy and family values.  Senator Jesse Helms, a leading North Carolina conservative at the time, was central to the family\u2019s political identity. As he spoke out against the Indian government\u2019s persecution of Sikhs, he won favor with the Punjabi diaspora in his own backyard. In the 1980s the Dhillon household became a political hub for Helms, who found wealthy donors among the state\u2019s hundreds of Sikh families.  While mulling her career path, Dhillon considered following her father into medicine. He never discouraged her, but he did describe surgery as physically taxing while asking her to contemplate her own physical strength and endurance. \u201cWomen have a lot of choices, and they frequently choose not to go into certain fields, which is totally legitimate,\u201d she says.  \u201cMy father was a turban-wearing man of faith when he decided to be a Republican in a Democratically controlled, Klan-heavy state in the South.\u201d  Instead, Dhillon studied classics at Dartmouth before going to law school at the University of Virginia. Her politics began to take shape as she served as editor-in-chief of the Dartmouth Review, a biweekly conservative newspaper, where in 1988 she published a satirical column likening the school\u2019s president to Adolf Hitler. She told the New York Times then that the column sought to shine light on \u201cliberal fascism,\u201d while demonstrating how the school had mistreated conservative students.  Now, as a Republican Party official in California, she applies her professional stature as a free-speech lawyer to advocate for conservatives. For example: She\u2019s representing the UC Berkeley students who are suing the school for snubbing Coulter.  Damore\u2019s class-action case fits that mold, arguing that he and other conservatives have been ostracized because their ideology was \u201cun-Googley\u201d at a place where there\u2019s an incentive for discriminating against whites, males and conservatives.  Dhillon was one of Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019s candidates to help run the Department of Justice\u2019s civil rights division, and she was reportedly considered for other political appointments in California and D.C. Had she gotten the civil rights job, Dhillon says, she would have prioritized First Amendment violations against conservatives, chased down human traffickers and fought for free speech at abortion clinics.  \u201cI\u2019m a supporter of the administration and the president, and that\u2019s my position. As a member of the RNC, if I couldn\u2019t support them on important issues, then I would resign my position,\u201d she says.  At a June 2016 Trump rally in San Jose, Dhillon witnessed city police ushering his supporters into the teeth of what would quickly boil over into a bloody confrontation with anti-Trump demonstrators. Stones and fists flew; red hats burned. The lawsuit, on behalf of 20 pro-Trump protesters, was Dhillon\u2019s reintroduction to national politics. The headlines opened doors for Dhillon, making her a fixture on Fox News as its only South Asian contributor. (Dhillon defeated San Jose\u2019s bid to dismiss the case, which is under appeal in federal court.)

Trump accepted the party\u2019s nomination the next day. In response, she says, she received death threats from fellow Sikhs and Indians.  Dhillon is soft-spoken about the ways in which she differs from her party and, particularly, the president. She does say America needs immigrants\u2014legal immigrants. An advocate for federalism, she\u2019d prefer to leave the federal government out of marriage and abortion rights. \u201cLife begins at conception,\u201d she says. \u201cAbortion should only be allowed in limited circumstances\u2014life of the mother and rape.\u201d She hates talking about that time she wrote now-Democratic Senator Kamala Harris a $250 check for a city campaign. \u201cIt was a nonpartisan race,\u201d she says, sounding like she has made this case before.  In 2012 she ran her latest political campaign, vying for a seat in the California State Senate. She was trounced in San Francisco\u2019s famed Castro neighborhood, but the 54,887 votes she won were the most ever for a Republican in the state\u2019s 11th District. She credits that small victory and her subsequent success to bending her California environment to her family, her party and her own ideals.  \u201cMy father was a turban-wearing man of faith when he decided to be a Republican in a Democratically controlled, Klan-heavy state in the South,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not Nikki Haley, and I\u2019m not Bobby Jindal.

The effort has had mixed results, at best, in the past.  With a trade war brewing between the world\u2019s two largest economies, the goal has gotten loftier still.  Tim Cook, chief executive officer of Apple, Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, and Ginny Rometty, head of IBM, are scheduled to attend the China Development Forum, an annual gathering that helps Western corporations build relationships with the country\u2019s government officials.  Cook is co-chairing the event this year, and Apple has the most at stake in China among U.S. tech companies. Its iPhones and other gadgets have sold well in the country, but revenue from the region fell in Apple\u2019s last fiscal year. The Cupertino, California-based company has also been criticized recently for relocating the data of Chinese iCloud users to state-controlled server farms.  Last year, International Business Machines Corp. announced a deal with Chinese company Wanda Group at the forum. The deal was meant to help IBM expand in the country\u2019s cloud market, though Caixin reported recently that Wanda would stop working with the U.S. company.  Google pulled out of mainland China in 2010 over government censorship of its search results. The company has been trying to return in recent years, but has made little progress.  These hurdles will only get higher if a trade war erupts between the U.S. and China. On Thursday, President Donald Trump ordered 25 percent tariffs on at least $50 billion of Chinese imports, including information and communication technology. He also accused China of stealing intellectual property. China responded with its own duties on some U.S. imports.  Apple could see a negative effect on about 15 percent of its business if China were to retaliate with duties on imports of U.S. products, Loup Ventures\u2019 Gene Munster said in an email earlier on Thursday.  Steve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm\u2019s CEO, will attend the conference but has canceled his plan to speak.  The conference comes just days after Bloomberg News reported that Chinese regulators are seeking more protections for local companies before approving Qualcomm\u2019s proposed purchase of NXP Semiconductors NV. China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce isn\u2019t satisfied with the remedies that Qualcomm has offered so far and has told the company to propose more, people familiar with the matter have said.  China is the world\u2019s biggest market for smartphones and a crucial customer base of Qualcomm\u2019s chips for mobile phones. The San Diego, California-based company won the right to extend its technology licensing business in China in 2015 after paying a fine and agreeing to charge lower rates to local customers on phones for that market.  \u2014 With assistance by Mark Bergen, Ian King, and Gerrit De Vynck", "stock": "GOOGL"}, {"url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-18/google-braced-for-england-s-first-right-to-be-forgotten-trial", "label": 1, "source": "bloomberg", "date": "2018-01-19", "article": "Google Inc. is set for its first battle in a London court over the so-called \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d in two cases that will test the boundaries between personal privacy and public interest.  Two anonymous people, who describe themselves in court filings as businessmen, want the search engine to take down links to information about their old convictions.  One of the men had been found guilty of conspiracy to account falsely, and the other of conspiracy to intercept communications, Judge Matthew Nicklin said at a pre-trial hearing Thursday. Those convictions are old and are now covered by an English law -- designed to rehabilitate offenders -- that says they can effectively be ignored. With a few exceptions, they don\u2019t have to be disclosed to potential employers.  \u201cThis is the first time that the English court is going to decide the issue of the right to be forgotten,\u201d Nicklin said.  The search-engine giant has already become embroiled in battles at the European Union\u2019s top court over the right to be forgotten. The principle -- created by the EU\u2019s highest court in a precedent-setting ruling in May 2014 -- allows people to ask for links to online information about them to be removed from search results if it\u2019s outdated or irrelevant. The ruling is only valid in the 28-nation bloc, but Google has clashed with privacy regulators over attempts to apply it beyond the EU.  \u201cWe work hard to comply with the right to be forgotten, but we take great care not to remove search results that are clearly in the public interest and will defend the public\u2019s right to access lawful information,\u201d a Google spokeswoman said.  Lawyers for the plaintiffs didn\u2019t comment.  Not Celebrities  Nicklin said Thursday that while the two cases were not related, they raised the same legal issues. The first trial, in which the person challenging Google to remove information is known as NT1, will start on Feb. 27 and the second, in which the plaintiff is known as NT2, will start on March 13. Nicklin said the plaintiffs weren\u2019t celebrities or politicians and have been \u201crehabilitated\u201d since their convictions.  NT1 has been threatened in public places by people referring to the content that Google links to, \u201cand seeking to extract money from him in consequence,\u201d his court filings say. He \u201chas been and continues to be treated as a pariah in his personal, business and social life and has been unable to form any new friendships or personal relationships,\u201d they say.  \u2018Adverse Attention\u2019  NT2\u2019s papers say some financial institutions are unwilling to deal with him \u201con private or commercial business\u201d after looking him up on Google. The search engine results have attracted \u201cadverse attention\u201d to him and by association to members of his close family.  The case concerns an \u201carea of the law in which two human rights come into conflict,\u201d Nicklin said. \u201cThe right to be forgotten is a dimension of the right to privacy and it conflicts with the right of freedom of expression.\u201d  He said a U.K. law from 1974 meant that, for all but the most serious offenses, people with convictions shouldn\u2019t \u201chave a lifelong \u2018blot\u2019 on their record but should be able to live without that shadow.\u201d The internet \u201cprovides a challenge\u201d to that right, he said, but also noted that some people were concerned that the right to be forgotten \u201cmight lead, in effect, to censorship.\u201d  Google has \u201cstaked quite a lot of resources\u201d on trying to do a good job of deciding when to approve requests for links to be taken down, said George Brock, a journalism professor at City, University of London and the author of a 2016 book about the right to be forgotten. He said Google had been \u201copaque\u201d about its approach to making those decisions. If this case shed light on how it reached the decisions, \u201cit would be a real breakthrough,\u201d he said.  Super-Injunctions  The men are being represented by the law firm Carter Ruck. It has defended clients in privacy and libel actions and was one of the first firms to use super-injunctions, court orders that prevent publication of any confidential information relating to a person or an issue and also any existence of the order itself.  The pair\u2019s court papers say that revealing their identity would \u201cdefeat the object of the claims.\u201d  Google has publicly raised the alarm about risks to freedom of speech that it says are posed by the right to be forgotten. Two separate European Court of Justice cases about that right \u201crepresent a serious assault on the public\u2019s right to access lawful information,\u201d Google\u2019s general counsel, Kent Walker, said in a blog post in November.

Google Assistant actions are similar to Amazon Alexa skills.  The new features \u2014 Custom Device Actions, push notifications, and support for media playback \u2014 could incentivize more developers to create actions for Google Assistantand drive consumer engagement, ultimately making Google Assistant a stronger competitor in the voice assistant landscape. That's because the more voice apps out there, the more useful \u2014 and appealing \u2014 the voice platform is for consumers.  Here are some of the new features for actions that Google is hoping will win over more voice developers:  Custom Device Actions to enable developers to implement native functionality that's specific to their devices. Currently, developers are limited to universal commands that Google implemented. But with Custom Device Actions, developers have the flexibility to extend Google Assistant to fully support their devices by adding their own custom actions. For example, a manufacturer of a smart dishwasher could add a command for an action that's not universal across other dishwashers, like \"start a hypercycle.\"  Currently, developers are limited to universal commands that Google implemented.

A new push notification API enables apps to send out alerts to users about the latest content available. Google is likely relying on notifications to bolster user retention and engagement, as they have been successful for smartphone apps. For example, push-enabled app users logged 53% more monthly sessions in mobile apps compared with users who hadn't engaged with a push message, according to Localytics.

For example, push-enabled app users logged 53% more monthly sessions in mobile apps compared with users who hadn't engaged with a push message, according to Localytics. Support for media playback and improved content carousels. Actions will now support media playback \u2014 such as meditation sessions, relaxing sounds, and clips from TV shows \u2014 on speakers and Android phones. Additionally, actions that are highly visual-based, such as those on smart speakers with display screens, can include a browse carousel that enables users to visually browse content (see below).  The new features will be key in bolstering user engagement and retention for Google Actions, which are two sore spots for voice app developers. One of the main issues with voice assistants is discoverability of voice apps \u2014 only 48% of smart speaker owners have used a third-party voice app, according to Voicebot.ai. And once they find a voice app, there's only a 6% chance that the user will continue using that voice app within two weeks, according to a September 2017 report from VoiceLabs. The new features could help to reduce the friction associated with voice app discovery and, in turn, drive engagement and retention.  Business Insider Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has written a detailed report on voice apps that explores the two major viable voice app stores. It identifies the three big issues voice apps are facing \u2014 discoverability, monetization, and retention \u2014 and presents possible short-term solutions ahead of industry-wide fixes.  Here are some of the key takeaways from the report:  The market for smart speakers and voice platforms is expanding rapidly. The installed base of smart speakers and the volume of voice apps that can be accessed on them each saw significant gains in 2017. But the new format and the emerging voice ecosystems that are making their way into smart speaker-equipped homes is so far failing to align with consumer needs.  Voice app development is a virtuous cycle with several broken components. The addressable consumer market is expanding, which is prompting more brands and developers to developer voice apps, but the ability to monetize and iterate those voice apps is limited, which could inhibit voice app growth.  Monetization is only one broken component of the voice app ecosystem. Discoverability and user retention are equally problematic for voice app development.  While the two major voice app ecosystems \u2014 Amazon's and Google's \u2014 have some Band-Aid solutions and workarounds, their options for improving monetization, discoverability, and retention for voice apps are currently limited.  There are some strategies that developers and brands can employ in the near term ahead of more robust tools and solutions.

Google was a big early investor in Uber.  Kalanick described his early relationship with Google founder Larry Page as little brother/big brother.  And then he discussed how it disintegrated as Google started to compete with Uber.  Uber's former CEO Travis Kalanick took the stand this week in San Francisco to defend Uber in a lawsuit brought by Waymo. Waymo, the self-driving car startup spun out of Google parent Alphabet, is suing Uber, alleging Uber stole its trade secrets. Uber contends it did not steal those trade secrets.  In some ways, this trial is like an ugly Silicon Valley divorce. Google was actually one of Uber's early big investors. Back in 2013, Google Ventures invested $258 million into Uber, which was its largest investment to date. Google senior vice president David Drummond also joined Uber's board.  \"We got an investment from Google. I was meeting with Larry Page. They picked me up in a self-driving car and I was like, 'that's pretty cool,'\" Kalanick testified, according to the live tweets from the trial by Recode's Johana Bhuiyan\u200f.  \"The general understanding is Google is doing this self driving thing. Uber is doing this ride share thing. Maybe we can partner up,\" Kalanick testified.  In those days, Kalanick looked up to Page and Drummond, he said.  \"It was kind of like little brother/big brother ... kind of hard to grok now. I looked at David Drummond and Larry Page kind of like big brothers ... maybe trying to get more time than they were trying to give.\"  But then Google grew increasingly interested in launching its own Uber competitor. Kalanick grew worried about Google's plans when its star self-driving engineer Chris Urmson was openly talking about creating a self-driving robot taxi fleet at the Detroit auto show in January 2015. Kalanick asked Drummond to set up a meeting with Larry Page about it, according to emails shared at the trial.  A few months later, an increasingly freaked out Kalanick asked for a meeting again, telling Drummond, \"A meeting with with Larry could calm this down if it's not true, but he has been avoiding any meeting with me since last fall. Without any dialogue, we get pushed into the assumption that Google is competing in the short term and has probably been planning to do so for quite a bit longer than has been let on.\"  Meanwhile, Kalanick wasn't waiting for that meeting. Uber had gone on a hiring binge of robotics engineers from Carnegie Mellon University.  When Kalanick did finally meet with Page, the two were already at odds, Kalanick testified, describing the meeting like this: \"Larry was fairly upset with us about us acquiring the CMU team ... He was sort of a little angsty and said 'why are you doing my thing?'\"  By August 2016, with the Waze carpooling service expanding in the Bay Area and Uber going fully into developing self-driving cars, Drummond left Uber's board, citing increasing conflicts of interest.  Later that month, Uber bought the self-driving truck startup of former star Google self-driving engineer Anthony Levandowski. Shortly after that, Waymo sued Uber.  Fast forward to the middle of 2017 and this lawsuit was one of the major reasons Kalanick lost his job as CEO of Uber last year, according to Benchmark, the investor that orchestrated his ousting.", "stock": "GOOGL"}, {"url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/crazy-google-patents-2016-7", "label": -1, "source": "business-insider", "date": "2018-02-04", "article": "Google is known for pursuing ambitious projects it typically dubs as \"moonshots.\"  From self-driving cars to drone delivery, the tech giant always seems to have a futuristic project in the works.

It has a few too many divisors to write out here \u2014 33 proper divisors in total \u2014 but the sum of its proper divisors does in fact come back up to itself.  In addition to their defining curious property, perfect numbers are relatively rare. They are closely connected to a certain class of prime numbers called Mersenne primes, or prime numbers that are one less than 2 raised to some prime number. Each even perfect number has a corresponding Mersenne prime.  Mersenne primes are interesting because it's relatively computationally easy to check whether a candidate Mersenne prime is in fact prime. Because of that, most of the largest prime numbers yet discovered are Mersenne primes, including the largest currently known prime number, 2 77,232,917 - 1.  Only 50 Mersenne primes have been found so far, which means because of their correspondence, only 50 perfect numbers are known so far. That makes Google's buyback choice quite a special number.  Google has a history of making mathematical references. In 2011, the company bid a multiple of pi in an auction for Nortel Networks' tech patents. Shortly after renaming itself Alphabet in 2015, the company announced a buyback in the amount of $5,099,019,513.59, which happens to be the square root of 26 x 10 18\u2014 26, of course, being the number of letters in the alphabet. Google's name itself comes from the massively large number called a \"googol\" \u2014 10^100, or a 1 followed by 100 zeros.", "stock": "GOOGL"}, {"url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/google-loretta-lee-lawsuit-alleges-harassment-2018-3", "label": -1, "source": "business-insider", "date": "2018-02-28", "article": "Business Insider Australia  A former Google software engineer has filed a lawsuit full of disturbing allegations of harassment by male colleagues and discrimination by Google.  Loretta Lee worked at Google for eight years before being fired in 2016.  She said she was the subject of lewd comments and once found a male colleague hiding under her desk.  Lee said she only reluctantly reported the desk incident to human resources, fearing retaliation, and was subsequently ostracized by colleagues who she said revised her software code and stalled her projects.  Google says it takes the allegations seriously. The company is dealing with multiple lawsuits accusing it of discriminating against employees on the basis of gender or political views.  A former Google engineer named Loretta Lee has filed a lawsuit against her former employer full of disturbing allegations of harassment \u2014 including one in which she said she once found a male coworker hiding beneath her desk.  In that incident, according to Lee's suit, she had been away from her desk and returned to find the man on all fours under her desk. The suit claims he popped out and said \"You'll never know what I was doing!\"  Lee said the colleague was a relative stranger and she feared he had installed a camera under her desk. The same coworker, she said, approached her the following day, grabbed her lanyard, asked her name, and in doing so grazed her chest.  In her suit, Lee characterized the incident as just one example of repeated harassment during her eight years with Google, a unit of Alphabet.  The former Google engineer Loretta Lee. LinkedIn  \"In a male-dominated workplace, Plaintiff was frequently subjected to sexual harassment as her male co-workers engaged in inappropriate behavior and made lewd remarks to her,\" the lawsuit says, adding that Google \"failed to prevent this severe and pervasive sexual harassment.\"  She said male colleagues would \"spike\" her drinks with whiskey and then \"laugh about it.\"  One man texted her asking whether she wanted a \"horizontal hug,\" she said, adding that another once turned up at her apartment unannounced with a bottle of alcohol, asking whether she needed help fixing a device. She also said one man slapped her at a party for no apparent reason.  Some of the other allegations described more childish behavior, with Lee accusing colleagues of firing Nerf guns at her.  Lee said she joined Google when she was 26 and its \"bro culture\" was the only working environment she knew.  She said when the desk incident happened in January 2016 she was encouraged to report it to Google's human-resources department \u2014 but did so only reluctantly. She said she was then ostracized by her managers, who she claims made unnecessary revisions to her code and stalled her projects. Eventually, she said, Google persuaded her to take medical leave in February. When she returned, she was fired for \"performance issues,\" her suit claims.  Lee's suit claims she had been a good performer at Google, winning coding competitions and receiving good feedback from managers before her firing.  Lee said Google discriminated against her after she was in a serious car accident  Things started to fall apart, according to the suit, in July 2015, when Lee said she was overworked and took some time out for her mental health. She returned in November but was almost immediately in a serious car accident and needed more time out to recover.  Until that point, she said, Google had been supportive but her managers were not. When she wanted time out for physical-therapy appointments, she said, a senior manager told her she had \"better be doing that on [her] own time.\"  The lawsuit said: \"Google's bro-culture contributed to Plaintiff's suffering frequent sexual harassment and gender discrimination, for which Google failed to take corrective action. Additionally, Google discriminated against Plaintiff on the basis of her disability, failed to accommodate her, retaliated against her, and terminated her.\"  Google has yet to give its side of the story. \"We have strong policies against harassment in the workplace and review every complaint we receive,\" the company said in a statement. \"We take action when we find violations \u2014 including termination of employment.\"  Lee's suit follows a similar lawsuit filed by another ex-Google engineer, Tim Chevalier.

This little city was designed to show off all the different types of things the Google Assistant can do. Alex Wong/Getty Images  Google was aggressively pushing its Assistant at CES 2018, with a marketing blitz and a party with a performance by John Legend.  Google announced a bunch of new, key partnerships with companies including LG, Sony, and Lenovo to integrate with the Google Assistant.  However, Amazon's Alexa, and its line of Echo smart speakers, still dominate the market, with no signs of slowing down.  At last week's Consumer Electronics Show, the Google Assistant was inescapable.  There was a \"Hey Google\" ad on the side of the Las Vegas monorail, a reference to the magic words for invoking voice commands with the Google Assistant. The search giant also had a massive booth with a slide, which infamously got flooded out during an unseasonably intense storm on the first day of the show.  Indoors, many, if not most, of the internet-connected appliance vendors at the show boasted \"Works with Google Assistant\" emblems on their booth, or some variation. And then there was Google's CES party where John Legend performed for a very exclusive audience.  Google had some big news at the show, too: It was partnering up with companies including Lenovo, LG, and Sony to launch a line of Google Assistant-powered \"smart displays,\" which are basically just Google Home speakers with a screen. Plus, companies like Bose and LG are building Assistant into their headphones and TVs, respectively.  This was all clearly Google's way of striking back at Amazon Alexa, the market leader in this new category of voice-command devices.  Amazon was far and away the winner of last year's CES, with Alexa the star of many show-floor demonstrations. Google was at last year's CES, too, promoting its Google Home speakers. But all anybody wanted to talk about was Alexa.  At the 2018 show, Google Assistant grabbed the spotlight.  \"It is too early to measure the impact of Google's presence at CES, but they certainly made an impression,\" says Gartner Research Director Werner Goertz, who was at the show.  People lined up for hours at CES 2018 to try out this Google Assistant-powered vending machine, which dispensed prizes just for trying out the technology. Matt Weinberger/Business Insider  Indeed, Google has made great strides in catching up with Alexa in a very short time. The first Amazon Echo, which introduced Alexa, dropped in 2014. Google Home was released in late 2016, and within a year, had established itself as the most meaningful opponent to Alexa. I, personally, prefer Google Assistant to Amazon Alexa in my everyday life.  Google's \"smart displays\" are a direct answer to the Amazon Echo Show and Echo Spot, the first-ever Alexa devices with screens. And all of those new partner product integrations make the Google Assistant way more competitive with Alexa, which used its head start to establish itself as a dominant standard in the smart home.  This is all fine, as far as it goes. But the problem for Google as it rushes to play catch-up: Amazon hasn't stood still.  Amazon Echo is also getting better  First and foremost are the numbers; Amazon hints that Alexa products are outselling Google's. While Google says that it sold about 7 million Google Home speakers over the holiday season, Amazon said that it sold \"tens of millions\" of Alexa products over the same period. Without exact figures, it's hard to get a direct comparison, but the message is clear, and Google is lagging.  A big reason for that success is that Amazon keeps iterating and releasing new products. Just last year, Amazon released an all-new Echo, the Echo Plus home hub, the fashion camera Echo Look, the Echo Show, the Echo Spot, and even Echo Buttons, simple Bluetooth game controllers for the Echo.  Google, for comparison, released two new Home speakers, the $50 Mini and the $400 Max. And while Google claims the former is selling quite well, the latter is definitely more of a niche product for higher-end audiophiles (or wannabe DJs).  Those new Home products are good in their own right, but they're not as interesting as Amazon's Echo experiments. For instance, Amazon is playing around with new ways to interact with Alexa \u2014 the Echo Look camera helps you create a fashion look book for yourself; the Echo Plus streamlines the complicated process of adding smart home gear. Meanwhile, the Google Home Mini and Max are just variations on the same basic concept for a smart speaker that Amazon pioneered with the original Echo back in 2014.  Lots of companies were proudly promoting their Google Assistant integrations at CES 2018. Matt Weinberger/Business Insider  On the software side, both companies are getting better and at a fast rate. This is actually where Google shines, as its investments in artificial intelligence means that Google Home is getting better by the day at playing music, mapping a route, or even letting you know when a flight is cheap.  Gartner's Goertz lauds the progress Google has made with building out the Google Assistant ecosystem, but says there's still a ways to go, partnership-wise, to really catch up with Alexa.  Meanwhile, Amazon is making serious investments in turning Alexa into a platform. This year, as we previously reported, Amazon has big plans to start paying developers of the 30,000 Alexa \"skills,\" or apps, which could turn Alexa into an economy and ecosystem all on its own.  Google hasn't quite gotten to that point with Assistant yet, and so developers could well feel like there's a bigger incentive to stick with Alexa.  In short, Google is making serious inroads and has become the biggest roadblock to Amazon just completely running away with this young market. But Amazon is proving once again that it can move faster than its rivals. Google will have to pick up the pace if it wants to go beyond dominating CES, and into dominating the market.", "stock": "GOOGL"}, {"url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/google-hangouts-is-now-available-2018-2", "label": -1, "source": "business-insider", "date": "2018-02-28", "article": "Google Hangouts Chat on the PC web browser. Google  Google is finally releasing Hangouts Chat, its messaging app for business.  It's going right up against Microsoft Teams, Cisco Spark, and the $5 billion Silicon Valley startup Slack.  This is yet another attempt by Google to create a successful messaging platform. However, competition in this space is steep.  On Wednesday, Google is expected to make Hangouts Chat, its long-promised workplace chatroom tool for businesses, available to enterprise users of its G Suite productivity service. Google shared the news in a blog entry.  Hangouts Chat is available from the web browser, or from iOS and Android apps.  The service was first announced almost exactly a year ago, right alongside Hangouts Meet, a videoconferencing tool. Hangouts Meet has been available to the public for months, but Chat has so far only been available to a relative few G Suite customers in the Early Adopter Program.  Now, Hangouts Chat will go right up against some of tech's biggest guns. $5 billion startup Slack provides what many consider the gold standard in team communication software, while the similar Microsoft Teams is a key part of the Office 365 cloud productivity suite for businesses.

However, all of that competition means Google has its work cut out for it.  Google Hangouts Chat on the smartphone. Google  Like Slack, Hangouts Chat is built for intra-company communication. Each chatroom can support up to 8,000 members. Google bills integrations with the rest of the G Suite services \u2014 including Google Docs, Google Drive, and Google Sheets \u2014 as key selling points for Hangouts Chat.  Like Slack and Microsoft Teams, Hangouts Chat supports chatbots. It comes with a total of 25 bots built in, including bots to tell you when a Google Drive file is updated, or when you have a Google Calendar appointment. You can also install bots that integrate with outside services, like Atlassian Jira or Salesforce CRM.

A malfunction in Google's devices could cause WiFi routers to become overwhelmed and temporarily shut down.  TP-Link has confirmed the issue, and WiFi routers from other companies are also reportedly affected.  Several of Google's hardware devices, including the popular Chromecast video streaming dongle and the new top-of-the-line smart speaker, appear to suffer from a glitch that can temporarily freeze a consumer's home wireless network.  Numerous owners of the devices have recently reported experiencing WiFi network issues, and several tech blogs say Google is to blame.  On Tuesday, a maker of networking products by the name of TP-Link wrote in a blog post that its routers have been affected by Google devices that use the Google \"casting\" feature. The company said a glitch caused a WiFi network to become temporarily unresponsive or disconnect from other devices that were connected to the network.  WiFi routers from other companies, including Linksys, Asus, Netgear, and Synology are also reportedly affected.  It's not clear whether the problem stems from a flaw in Google's hardware, or whether it's the result of a broader software issue.  But the news represents the latest blow to Google's efforts to enter the hardware market, where it has limited experience and competes against longtime gadget makers like Samsung and Apple. In October, Google was forced to disable a button on the Home Mini smart speaker before the product even shipped due to a privacy problem.  Google \"casting\" devices come out of sleep mode and cause disruptions  According to TP-Link's blog post on the WiFi issue, the problems began in October 2017.  Google The company explained that under normal circumstances, Google's casting devices are designed to wake from a sleep state every so often to communicate with a WiFi router with small bits of data, called \"packets.\"  The problem is that some of Google's devices were malfunctioning and wouldn't rise out sleep mode for longer periods of time. When they did awake from their slumber, they flooded a WiFi router with huge amounts of data packets at a \"very high speed,\" which would overwhelm certain routers and cause the disruptions. The amount of data that would be sent to a WiFi router depended on how long a Google casting device was in sleep mode.  TP-Link has issued firmware updates for its affected WiFi routers, and a statement from Google to Engadget said \"We're aware that a small number of users are having issues and our team is working quickly to share a solution.\"  One of the ways to prevent WiFi network issues is to disable the casting feature in your Google casting devices. Of course, if the product is a Chromecast, that means you're effectively making the product useless.  Business Insider has contacted Google for comment, as well as a clarification of which devices can become affected, but the company hasn't yet replied.  There are several devices that support Google's casting feature, like smartphones, tablets, media streamers, and smart TVs. It's unclear if its specifically Google's own casting hardware causing the disruptions, or if it's Google's casting software feature found in several devices, too.", "stock": "GOOGL"}, {"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/03/06/google-brings-lens-to-all-google-photos-users-on-android/", "label": 1, "source": "techcrunch", "date": "2018-03-06", "article": "Google Lens, the company\u2019s visual search engine that can recognize what\u2019s in your images and scan business cards, among other things, is now rolling out to all Google Photos users on Android.

Sure, it may be called Clips and it does, in fact, have a clip on the back. But do not clip it to your clothing. Google was very insistent about this bit.  Second, it is not an action camera. There are plenty available, if you\u2019re in the market. Google Clips is not that. Don\u2019t attach it to your skydiving helmet or motorcycle handlebars. Third, Clips is unequivocally not a security camera. Again, there are plenty of those. Here\u2019s one you can buy for $20.  So then what, precisely, is Clips? A \u201csmart camera,\u201d according to Google. It\u2019s a new category, of sorts. One that really couldn\u2019t have existed in this form without the current on-board technology. The device is actually a deceptively sophisticated collection of tech wrapped up in an adorable little package that looks like an Instagram icon that a fairy godmother turned into a real boy.  It\u2019s not exactly the \u201cset it and forget it\u201d device that we thought we were getting when the company first announced it way back when at its Pixel 2 event. As advertised, Clips is intended to capture little moments it might otherwise be tough to photograph. The system uses a combination of AI and ML to identify familiar people and animals and determine the moments worth capturing.  All of that happens through a robust combination of AI and ML, all processed directly on the device itself \u2014 rather than sending it off to a server for processing. This helps cut down on the processing time and maintains some privacy, with nothing you shoot leaving the camera until you choose to transfer it.  It\u2019s an interesting concept \u2014 and one that could certainly appeal to parents looking to capture those little moments without having to keep a smartphone or camera screen at the ready all the time. But is it $249 worth of interesting?  Fixed lens  A lot of thought clearly went into making Clips as simple as possible to operate. The result is an extremely minimalist object, roughly the size of a silver dollar. On the front is a large, fixed lens. Twisting it turns the camera on an off, while a trio of white lights let you know that it\u2019s on. Google says it purposely designed the Clips to be immediately recognizable as a camera, so people are aware that they\u2019re being recorded if they\u2019ve never seen one before. And, indeed, it looks like a real-world shorthand for the basic idea of a camera.  Below the lens is a single button \u2014 the only one on the device itself. This is the shutter. Something the company apparently only added after getting feedback from users. Sure, the system is built around the notion of using machine learning to take the perfect photos and videos, but sometimes you want to override that and not leave it up to chance.  On the bottom is a USB-C port for charging the battery and a small hole used to manually reset the system. The back of the device, meanwhile, is empty, save for a Google \u201cG\u201d logo. There\u2019s no built-in viewfinder, for several reasons, including, but not limited to: price, battery life and the desire to simplify the product as much as possible.  That means you\u2019ll have to sort of eyeball the ideal spot to place the camera to get the right shot. Given the fact that it\u2019s got a fixed focal length, there isn\u2019t a ton of wiggle room there. Google recommends placing it around three to eight feet from your subject. You also can tap into Live Preview on the accompanying app to get a better idea of what the camera is seeing. The feature also will let you know whether the camera is on a flat surface for better shots. Of course, staring at that sort of defeats the whole \u201cnot having to keep a smartphone or camera screen at the ready all the time\u201d thing.  A river runs through it  The Clips app is similarly simple, to a fault. By default, everything is captured in a seven-second video called\u2026 wait for it\u2026 a Clip. If you\u2019ve ever used Vine, Apple Live Photos or Google Motion Photos, you know the deal here. In fact, the videos shot on device can be saved as either of the latter two and, even more handily, an animated GIF.  Everything captured by the device is served up in a river. All of the shots appear as static images, until you scroll over them, at which point you can view the full seven seconds of action.  Tap on a Clip to edit it either as a still image or motion video. The device actually saves every Clip as a series of stills. Using the Photo option, you can scroll through to grab the perfect frame and save that as a JPEG. The video editing option, meanwhile, has built-in scrubbers that let you edit the length of the Clip.  Machine learning  Once you start capturing shots, you\u2019ll notice that some sport a sparkle icon in the upper-right corner. That shows up on \u201cSuggested Clips\u201d \u2014 when the system identifies the face of a familiar person or pet. If you want to utilize the functionality, you can connect your device to your Google Photos account and the system will cull facial information from there.  You also can just put the camera to use and it will pick up faces pretty quickly. That aspect did seem to be pretty hit or miss in our testing. There wasn\u2019t really much consistency with regard to which Clips of a particular subject the system identified as \u201csuggested.\u201d So far, it\u2019s been trained to capture humans, dogs and cats.  I also can confirm that it does a pretty decent job on rabbits. The Google team wasn\u2019t really sure how it would fare on that front, given some of the complexities of the artificial intelligence on board. For example, the system is trained to identify certain aspects, like standing on four legs, whereas rabbits tend to sit on their hind legs. But Google\u2019s AI managed to prevail here, so kudos to them, and congrats to the dozen or so people looking to pick up a Clips to grab photos of their bunny.  One perfect shot  Clips mostly does a good job capturing key moments. It\u2019s not perfect, of course. And really, it requires a bit of good-old-fashioned human curation. That\u2019s where you come in. Odds are you\u2019re only going to end up sharing a fraction of the shots the camera ends up capturing.  The device has 16GB of storage on board, so it\u2019s going to take you a while to fill the thing up with all of those 1080p videos \u2014 meaning it will be a while before you have to worry about going through and deleting things. The battery, meanwhile, should last around three hours on a charge. It also will go into sleep mode if it gets bored and doesn\u2019t spot any action.  The videos are captured in 1080p and the stills are roughly what you\u2019d expect from a standard smartphone camera. And as with many smartphones, Clips struggles in low-light situations. Images come back grainy and motion is blurry. The device will auto-adjust color settings like the default on a handset. You can\u2019t futz with those levels in the camera app \u2014 and honestly that level of control probably runs counter to the sort of plug and play functionality Google\u2019s shooting for here. Though extra control is never a bad thing.  Money clips  The first time I tested a smart security camera in my home, I ended up disabling the notifications. I was just getting way too many false positives. Every time my rabbit would move at home, the app would alert me, even if I was on the other side of the world. It was really annoying \u2014 but thankfully, the company added AI functionality that was able to distinguish animals and other movement from people.  Clips sort of works on the opposite principle, operating on the idea that the right combination of image smarts can scientifically capture the perfect moment in time. It\u2019s a new piece of technology designed to free you from being constantly tethered to another piece of technology. It\u2019s an odd proposition, and ultimately one that will likely be searching to find its audience for a generation or two.  Sure, there\u2019s appeal for parents looking to capture as many perfect moments with their kids before they get too old. And certainly plenty of pet owners need another excuse to fill their social media feeds full of adorable action shots. Clips certainly delivers as a GIF delivery service, but $249 is a steep price to pay for such novelty in an era when we\u2019ve all got a camera within arm\u2019s reach 24 hours a day.", "stock": "GOOGL"}, {"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/03/19/google-introduces-shopping-actions-to-help-retailers-in-their-battle-with-amazon/", "label": -1, "source": "techcrunch", "date": "2018-03-19", "article": "Google announced this morning a new plan to help retailers take on Amazon \u2013 and give Google a cut of their sales in the process. The search giant will allow retailers to list their products across Google Search, in its Google Express shopping service, and in the Google Assistant app for smartphones and on smart speakers, like the Google Home.  The program offers online shoppers a universal cart whether they\u2019re shopping on mobile, desktop or via a voice-powered device. That latter item is especially important to retailers, given that Amazon has tied voice shopping to its Echo devices, and has claimed the majority of market share in smart speakers for the time being. And you aren\u2019t able to shop Walmart from an Echo, of course.  Google is working with a range of top retailers on the new effort, including Target, Walmart, Ulta Beauty, Costco, and Home Depot. Some of these were detailed in the company\u2019s official announcement of Shopping Actions, as the program is called. A report from Reuters noted the others.  Walmart and Target were both already partnered with Google on voice-based shopping, which includes integrations with Google Express and Google Assistant. This allows customers to shop their site through the Google Express app or by saying things like \u201cbuy peanut butter from Walmart,\u201d to place a quick voice order with Google Assistant\u2019s help.  Those partnerships, and the new program being introduced today, also allows retailers to increase shopper loyalty by supporting things like 1-click re-ordering, personalized recommendations, and basket-building, says Google. For example, if a customer integrates their Ultamate Rewards account (Ulta\u2019s loyalty program) with Google, it will know what other products to recommend based on past order history when the shopper is searching for a particular item.  Google says it will use a pay-per-sale model, which means it\u2019s only taking a cut of the sale when a shopper makes a purchase. That\u2019s different from Google\u2019s pay-per-click ads, where businesses pay when a web searcher engages with an ad by visiting the website or calling the business.  According to Google, retail partners saw the average size of a customer\u2019s shopping basket increase by 30 percent after joining the program, and Ulta saw average order values increase 35 percent. Target, which has been live for 6 months, says its Google Express shopping baskets increased nearly 20 percent, on average.

Google has been promising Routines were in the works for some time.  The feature, which lets Google Assistant users string together multiple commands, was first announced back in October 2017. With Routines, you can create personalized commands and responses \u2013 for example, saying \u201cOK Google, I\u2019m home,\u201d could turn on the lights, adjust the thermostat, and play some music.  It\u2019s a feature that rival Alexa announced in September 2017, and launched the following month. Google is playing catch up here, but it\u2019s doing it quickly.  This isn\u2019t the only way that Google Assistant can multitask, however. Before, you could say two commands in one sentence \u2013 like \u201cturn on the TV and what\u2019s the weather?\u201d, and the smart assistant could perform both actions.  However, Routines will support tying together more than two commands, and will associate them with a trigger phrase.  According to Google, Routines will first launch in the U.S. in the weeks ahead, and will allow users to personalize six routines that help with morning commutes to and from work, and their evening at home.  In addition to Routines, location-based reminders is another new feature set to roll out in the near future.  This option is already available in Google Assistant on smartphones, but it will now be integrated into Google Home devices, as well.  Of course, the Google Home smart speaker stays in one location itself \u2013 but it can be used to create the location-based reminders you want to be alerted about later on your phone.  For example, you could tell your Google Home device to remind you to buy milk when you\u2019re at the grocery store.

But now, you\u2019ll be able to use your Google Home Mini which doesn\u2019t exactly have the most impressive built-in speakers, to control the Bluetooth-enabled bookshelf speakers you have in your living room.  Indeed, as Google notes in today\u2019s announcement, the company decided to add this feature because its Google Home Mini users requested it.

On Android, however, the Android Pay app stuck with its existing brand. That\u2019s changing today, though, with the launch of Google Pay for Android. With this, Google is rolling out an update to Android Pay and introducing some new functionality that the company hopes will make its payment service ubiquitous \u2014 both in stores and on the internet.  In addition, Google is also launching a redesign of the Google Wallet app for sending and requesting money, and it\u2019s now called Google Pay Send. Users in the U.S. and U.K., though, will also soon be able to use the Google Pay app for sending and requesting money. New users can download the Google Pay app today and existing Android Pay users will get updated over the course of the next few days.  At first glance, the new Google Pay app is basically a redesign of Android Pay, with a look and feel that adheres closer to Google\u2019s own Material Design guidelines than the original. In terms of functionality, there isn\u2019t all that much here that\u2019s new. One notable change, though, is that the Google Pay home screen now shows you relevant stores around you where you can pay with Google Pay. That list is personalized, based on previous stores where you used the service, as well as your location. In addition, the home screen shows you all of your recent purchases and you can still add all of your loyalty cards to the app.  As Google\u2019s VP of Product Management for Payments, Pali Bhat, told me, the team really wanted to make it extremely easy to get started with Google Pay and use the service to pay for goods online and in the real world \u2014 and to do so with as little friction as possible. That means that users who bank with Bank of America in the U.S. or a Google partner like Mbank in Poland can set up Google Pay right from their bank\u2019s app without having to install Google Pay. Once that\u2019s set up, you can simply pay with Google Pay online and out in the real world.  Similarly, if an online app or website wants to support this, developers can call a Google API to see if a given user has Google Pay enabled and can then accept payments through Google Pay (which still get routed through the developers\u2019 regular payment processors like Stripe or Braintree).  \u201cWe give developers a very simple API to implement Google Pay,\u201d Bhat noted. \u201cThe API is simple because we are not processing that payment.

The feature is available within the Google Photos iOS application, where it can do things like identify objects, buildings, and landmarks, and tell you more information about them, including helpful details like their phone number, address, or open hours. It can also identify things like books, paintings in museums, plants, and animals. In the case of some objects, it can also take actions.  For example, you can add an event to your calendar from a photo of a flyer or event billboard, or you can snap a photo of a business card to store the person\u2019s phone number or address to your Contacts. (Turning photos into Contacts is something that Microsoft just added to its Pix app, too, with the option of also locating the person on LinkedIn.)  Google Lens was first announced last year at Google\u2019s I/O developer conference, and is made possible by the recent advancements in machine learning and image recognition technologies. The eventual goal is to allow smartphone cameras to understand what it is they\u2019re seeing across any type of photo, then helping you take action on that information, if need be \u2013 whether that\u2019s calling a business, saving contact information, or just learning about the world on the other side of the camera.  During the demo at I/O, Google showed off how Google Lens could do other things, too. It could be used to help you configure your Wi-Fi, for instance. That is, if you took a photo of the sticker on your router, it could help you to paste that information in your Wi-Fi settings to get you connected. The company also demonstrated a translation feature that converted signs in a foreign language to English.  It doesn\u2019t seem we\u2019re quite there yet with all these promised features, but they could become possible in the future as Google Lens matures.  According to a tweet from the Google Photos\u2019 Twitter account, Google Lens in Google Photos on iOS began rolling out on Thursday to those who have the latest version (3.15) of the app installed.

The smart assistant was first launched on iOS at Google I/O 2017, following its earlier introduction on Android devices, led by Google\u2019s Pixel phone.  At the time, however, it had only been available in English. Today, it\u2019s offered on iOS in English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese (Brazil) and Spanish, Google notes.  The arrival on iPad offers a similar experience as on iPhone, the only real difference being the larger screen and support for iPad-only features, like multitasking with a split screen.  While there\u2019s a lot of talk of the growing traction of smart speakers, like Amazon Echo, Google Home and Apple\u2019s HomePod, voice assistants have the potential for even broader reach by way of mobile devices. That\u2019s why it\u2019s critical for apps like Google Assistant or Amazon\u2019s Alexa app to support all platforms, and not just their own hardware \u2014 like Android devices or Fire tablets.  We\u2019ve seen the iPad, in particular, receiving attention on this front in recent days.  In fact, only yesterday, Amazon announced its Alexa app for tablets, including iPad, was being updated to support Alexa calling and messaging features which route communications through the Alexa platform.  Of course, neither the Alexa app nor Google Assistant are as accessible on iOS devices like iPad, compared with Siri, which can be activated with a press of a button or the voice command, \u201cHey Siri.\u201d  That said, for those who prefer Google\u2019s services on Apple hardware, the launch on iPad will be welcomed.  When you ask Google Assistant to text or call a friend, it will pull that information from your iOS Address Book, after you authorize it to do so. It also can help you compose emails, set reminders and calendar events, play music, help you navigation, answer questions, cast to your TV and control connected smart home devices, among other things.  The new app also will take advantage of multitasking on iPad with iOS 11, allowing you to chat with the assistant while performing another task in the other window, like checking your calendar or planning a trip, Google says. The app works in either portrait or landscape mode, too.

In an effort to more deeply integrate Google\u2019s search engine on iOS devices, the company announced today that its Search app for iOS has added an iMessage extension, allowing iPhone and iPad users to search the web, then quickly add those search results to their iMessage conversations.  The extension itself is clearly inspired by Google\u2019s experiments with Gboard, Google\u2019s own third-party keyboard app for iOS devices, and comes at a time when the popularity of alternative iOS keyboards seems to be declining. Nuance, for example, just shut down its Swype keyboard app; and Swiftkey had exited to Microsoft a couple of years ago.  With Google\u2019s iMessage extension, users can type a query in the search box, or tap a button below for a specific type of search \u2013 like Weather, Food, Nearby (venues/businesses), Trending (news), or Videos \u2013 all very similar to Gboard.    Google highlights restaurant search in particular in its announcement, as deciding where to eat is a common theme in iMessage chats. Tapping \u201cNearby\u201d can help quickly pull up business listings or points of interest near your current location, which is also useful when communicating about a particular location.  Each search result includes a \u201cShare\u201d button that, when tapped, adds the item directly into an iMessage conversation as card. When the recipient taps on the card, they\u2019ll go to the Google search result.  In addition, Google\u2019s iMessage app offers a GIF search engine. This is available by tapping on the \u201cGIF\u201d button to the right of the search box, which will immediately load a selection of GIFs from sites like Giphy and Tenor, which you can then filter further by performing a search.  GIF search is a popular feature in Gboard, following that app\u2019s update last year.  Making Gboard\u2019s features available via an iMessage extension makes sense because not everyone wants to swap out their default keyboard on their iOS device.  It also give Google another way to reach users on iOS, even when they\u2019re not in Google\u2019s app itself. This is important because Google\u2019s traffic acquisition costs have been climbing due to the shift to mobile devices, where apps and assistants like Siri serve up many of the answers users once turned to Google for, when on desktop. It also has to pay Apple billions to be the default search engine on iOS.  The app, like other iMessage extensions, is available by tapping the iMessage apps drawer in iMessage, then scrolling over to the Google app icon. (If you have a lot of iMessage apps already installed, it may be tucked away under \u201cMore.\u201d)  The iMessage extension is one of three new features Google announced today for iOS users. However, it has actually been available in the Google app since February 7, 2018, according to Sensor Tower, indicating more of a soft launch.  Google also added two other features that integrate its search engine into iOS in new ways. One is a new share sheet option \u2013 now, when you share a webpage from Safari with Google, it will also show you suggestions for related content. A similar feature launched last year in the Google Search app, but is annoying as it pops up over the content when you reach the bottom of the page. With the new Share with Google functionality, it makes a bit more sense as the idea is that you could move from a webpage in Safari directly into a set of Google search results on the topic/  Also new is support for drag and drop on iPad. You can use the feature to move text, images, and links to and from the Google app, share articles from Google into iMessage, or save them into Notes for later reading.

The company had been rumored to be courting a buyer since early this year. As Reuters noted at the time, Zagat has increasingly become less of a focus for Google, as the company began growing its database of restaurant recommendations organically. Zagat, meanwhile, has lost much of the shine it had when Google purchased it nearly a decade ago.

That also makes Google Play\u2019s download lead over iOS its largest ever, at 145 percent.  Specifically, the downloads were driven by markets including India, Indonesia, and Brazil, which all contributed to Google Play\u2019s 10 percent year-over-year growth in total downloads as well.  India, notably, also surpassed the U.S. for combined iOS and Android downloads for the first time in Q4.  As to what these new mobile users are downloading? Games, finance and personalization apps, says the report. Finance apps were also booming on iOS, where they ranked second in terms of downloads in Q4, thanks to users shifting their banking and investment activities to mobile, in addition to the growing interest in cryptocurrencies.  App Annie predicts the category will continue its strong growth in Q1 2018 as tax season approaches in the U.S., and more banks invest in their mobile presence.  Meanwhile, the Shopping category led on iOS in Q4, thanks to holiday m-commerce activity including Alibaba\u2019s Singles Day and Cyber Monday.

With the regard to delays, Google Flights won\u2019t just be pulling in information from the airlines directly, however \u2013 it will take advantage of its understanding of historical data and its machine learning algorithms to predict delays that haven\u2019t yet been flagged by airlines themselves.  Explains Google, the combination of data and A.I. technologies means it can predict some delays in advance of any sort of official confirmation. Google says that it won\u2019t actually flag these in the app until it\u2019s at least 80 percent confident in the prediction, though. (Of course, you should still get to the airport on time, but at least you\u2019ll know what you\u2019re about to face once there.)  It will also provide reasons for the delays, like weather or an aircraft arriving late.  You can track the status of your flight by searching for your flight number or the airline and flight route, notes Google. The delay information will then appear in the search results.  The other new feature added today aims to help travelers make sense of what Basic Economy fares include and exclude with their ticket price.  These low-cost fares are often the only option for travelers on a budget, but they have a number of restrictions that can vary by airline.  Google Flights will now display the restrictions associated with these fares \u2013 like restrictions on using overhead space or the ability to select a seat, as well as the fare\u2019s additional baggage fees. It\u2019s initially doing so for American, Delta and United flights worldwide.  These changes come only a month after Google Flights added price tracking and deals to Google Flights as well as hotel search features for web searchers.  The additions seem especially targeted toward today\u2019s travel startups and businesses, like Hopper which had just added hotel search, and uses big data to analyze airline prices and other factors; or TripIt, a competitor of sorts to Google\u2019s own travel app Google Trips, which most recently introduced security checkpoint wait times. (Given that Google already knows the busy times for area businesses by tracking people\u2019s movement via Google Maps, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see it implement security wait times next.)  The features are also a real-world demo of Google\u2019s machine learning and big data capabilities, especially in the case of predicting flight delays.

The new service is part of a widespread effort to expand the power of modern A.I. to businesses that are largely unfamiliar with this rapidly evolving technology. Like Google, a New York start-up called Clarifai offers an online service that helps customers train computer vision algorithms.  At the same time, several other start-ups, like Boston\u2019s DataRobot and Silicon Valley\u2019s H2O.ai, offer services designed to help businesses analyze the way products, customers, markets and employees behaved in the past and predict how they will perform in the future.  \u201cThey aim to automate data science in general,\u201d said Randy Olson, a data scientist at Life Epigenetics, a company in Portland, Ore.

A Google product manager, Rajen Sheth, said the company would work with these customers to determine the price.  Risto Miikkulainen, a professor of computer science at the University of Texas at Austin who has long explored the kind of technology that underpins Google\u2019s new service, agreed that it had the potential to help other businesses build their own A.I.  \u201cIt is really powerful technology,\u201d said Mr. Miikkulainen, who is also vice president of research at Sentient Technologies.  But sometimes, there is no substitute for good old human labor. With Google\u2019s new service, humans must label the data before the system can learn from it. Google can provide the human labelers, as do companies like CrowdFlower.  And even when an online service successfully automates a task, it\u2019s not necessarily worth using.  James Bradley and his London company, NMT Vision, once used Clarifai to train and operate algorithms to identify websites that are selling products that infringe on copyrights. But he and his company now handle this on their own, mainly because the cost is lower.

But when American Express appealed, the Second Circuit reversed, relying on a new concept to create a special set of rules. The concept is that players in \u201ctwo-sided\u201d markets are unique because they serve different sets of customers in distinct but related markets, effectively facilitating transactions. American Express, for example, charges both merchants who accept its cards and consumers who use them. Using this concept, the Second Circuit held that the government would have to show that any price increases for merchants also harmed cardholders, or at least didn\u2019t benefit them. In effect, the court introduced a dramatically new rule, making it much more difficult to win important antitrust cases and to stop anticompetitive behavior.  The case is now at the Supreme Court. If affirmed, the Second Circuit decision would create de facto antitrust immunity for the most powerful companies in the economy. Since internet technologies have enabled the growth of platform companies that serve multiple groups of users, firms like Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Uber are set to be prime beneficiaries of the Second Circuit\u2019s warped analysis. Amazon, for example, could claim status as a two-sided platform because it connects buyers and sellers of goods; Google because it facilitates a market between advertisers and search users. (An industry trade group representing the tech platforms filed an amicus brief in support of American Express.) Indeed, the reason that the tech giants are lining up behind the Second Circuit\u2019s approach is that \u2014 if ratified \u2014 it would make it vastly more difficult to use antitrust laws against them.  The fact that the tech platforms could effectively be shielded from antitrust is troubling because, in several respects, these firms enjoy dominant market positions that makes antitrust scrutiny of their conduct especially important. By virtue of providing increasingly critical services, tech giants wield immense leverage over the sellers and buyers that rely on their platforms. This power is ripe for abuse. If the Supreme Court ratifies the Second Circuit\u2019s approach, platforms will be able to engage in anticompetitive activity with one set of users, so long as they can plausibly claim that harmful conduct enabled them to benefit another group. Say, for example, that Uber prohibited its drivers from also serving rivals like Lyft, suppressing driver income. Under the current approach, these exclusive agreements would likely violate antitrust law. But under the Second Circuit\u2019s analysis, the case would go nowhere unless plaintiffs could show that this practice also harmed riders.  This danger is compounded by the slipperiness of the concept underlying this analysis: the idea of a \u201ctwo-sided\u201d market. While reports paid for by the credit card industry introduce \u201ctwo-sided\u201d markets as a novel concept that requires special analysis, markets serving different groups of users have been around for centuries. They include, for example, grain futures exchanges (connecting farmers and buyers of farm products), banking (linking depositors and borrowers) and newspapers (serving advertisers and readers). For decades, courts have recognized that anticompetitive conduct imposed by a newspaper on readers, for example, is no less illegal if it can be shown to benefit advertisers.  Indeed, almost all markets can be understood as having two sides. Firms ranging from airlines to meatpackers could reasonably argue that they meet the definition of \u201ctwo-sided,\u201d thereby securing less stringent review.", "stock": "GOOGL"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/23/technology/trolls-step-ahead-facebook-youtube-florida-shooting.html", "label": 1, "source": "the-new-york-times", "date": "2018-02-24", "article": "The resilience of misinformation, despite efforts by the tech behemoths to eliminate it, has become a real-time case study of how the companies are constantly a step behind in stamping out the content.

The difficulty of dealing with inappropriate online content stands out with the Parkland shooting because the tech companies have effectively committed to removing any accusations that the Parkland survivors were actors, a step they did not take after other recent mass shootings, such as last October\u2019s massacre in Las Vegas. In the past, the companies typically addressed specific types of content only when it was illegal \u2014 posts from terrorist organizations, for example \u2014 Mr. Morgan said.  Facebook and YouTube\u2019s promises follow a stream of criticism in recent months over how their sites can be gamed to spread Russian propaganda, among other abuses. The companies have said they are betting big on artificial intelligence systems to help identify and take down inappropriate content, though that technology is still being developed.  The companies have in the meantime hired or said they plan to hire more people to comb through what is posted to their sites. Facebook said it was hiring 1,000 new moderators to review content and was making changes to what type of news publishers would be favored on the social network. YouTube has said that it plans to have 10,000 moderators by year\u2019s end and that it is altering its search algorithms to return more videos from reliable news sources.

The sites have automated detection systems that often search for specific terms or images that have previously been deemed unacceptable. So to evade those systems, people sometimes can alter images or switch to different terminology.  Sam Woolley, an internet researcher at the nonprofit Institute for the Future, said far-right groups had started using internet brands to describe minorities \u2014 like \u201cSkype\u201d to indicate Jewish people \u2014 to trick software and human reviewers.  Those who post conspiracy theories also tend to quickly repost or engage with similar posts from other accounts, creating a sort of viral effect that can cause the sites\u2019 algorithms to promote the content as a trending topic or a recommended video, said David Carroll, a professor at the New School who studies tech platforms.  That duplication and repackaging of misinformation \u201cmake the game of snuffing it out Whac-a-Mole to the extreme,\u201d he said.  That game played out across the web in the past few days, after a video suggesting that one of the most vocal Parkland survivors, David Hogg, was an actor became the No. 1 trending video on YouTube. After a public outcry, YouTube removed the video and said it would take down other \u201ccrisis actor\u201d videos because they violated its ban on bullying.

Last year, James Damore, a little-known engineer on Google\u2019s search infrastructure team, incited outrage at the company and across Silicon Valley for making an argument that seemed to rationalize the pay and opportunity gap between genders at technology companies.  Before he was fired by Google, Mr. Damore filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board saying that the company had violated his right to engage in concerted activity to address a workplace problem.  But Jayme L. Sophir, an associate general counsel at the labor agency, said that Google\u2019s actions were acceptable because they made clear that Mr. Damore was being fired for comments that advanced stereotypes \u2014 not for speaking out about the company.

The companies have also been accused by lawmakers, critics and activists of monopolistic tendencies and manipulative product design.

In some ways, the complaints from the right about Big Tech mirror the grumblings of legacy news organizations, which have expressed concern that online algorithms wield too much power over how readers gain access to their content.  Jeffrey A. Zucker, the president of CNN, derided Google and Facebook as \u201cmonopolies\u201d and called for regulators to step in during a speech in Spain last month, saying the tech hegemony is \u201cthe biggest issue facing the growth of journalism in the years ahead.\u201d And former President Barack Obama said at an off-the-record conference at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology last month that he worried Americans were living in \u201centirely different realities\u201d and that large tech companies like Facebook were \u201cnot just an invisible platform, they\u2019re shaping our culture in powerful ways.\u201d The contents of the speech were published by Reason magazine.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  In the right\u2019s more internet-savvy quarters, tech platforms have been a regular \u2014 and fruitful \u2014 subject of discussion since before the 2016 election. In May that year, Facebook was forced to respond to claims that the curators of its Trending Topics feature had suppressed conservative news sources, a controversy that called attention to Facebook\u2019s editorial power.  That charge of editorial bias was echoed last weekend by Alex Jones, the conspiracy theorist behind Infowars, who accused YouTube of planning to delete his organization\u2019s account, a claim that was widely shared among conservatives.  YouTube did delete some videos that accused teenage survivors of the Parkland, Fla., school shooting of being \u201ccrisis actors,\u201d and it issued \u201cstrikes,\u201d or warnings, to the accounts of Infowars and Jerome Corsi, a conservative author and Infowars contributor. (YouTube denied that it had plans to delete the Infowars account.)  Facebook has also caught flak for adjusting the algorithm for its News Feed to emphasize posts from \u201cfriends, family and groups\u201d over content from public pages. The change was part of an effort by the company to answer criticism, but also to reinvigorate its oldest and most profitable product, which recently recorded a decline in American daily users for the first time in its history.  The Facebook adjustment has affected virtually every media organization that is partly dependent on the platform for audiences, but it appears to have hit some harder than others. They include right-wing sites like Gateway Pundit and the millennial-focused Independent Journal Review, which was forced to lay off staff members last month.  The social news giant BuzzFeed recently bought ads on Facebook with the message, \u201cFacebook is taking the news out of your News Feed, but we\u2019ve got you covered,\u201d directing users to download its app. Away from the political scrum, the viral lifestyle site LittleThings, once a top publisher on the platform, announced last week that it would cease operations, blaming \u201ca full-on catastrophic update\u201d to Facebook\u2019s revised algorithms.  Right-wing media has pounced. In late February, citing statistics from the social analytics firm NewsWhip, Breitbart published an article on the effects on the president\u2019s Facebook page with the headline \u201cEXCLUSIVE: Trump\u2019s Facebook Engagement Declined By 45 Percent Following Algorithm Change.\u201d The drop, the article insinuated, occurred \u201cfollowing a year of pressure from left-wing employees and the mainstream media for \u2018allowing\u2019 the president to win the 2016 general election.\u201d  Still, the brewing backlash did not stop Google and Facebook from courting the very crowd that now seems ready to declare them enemies. Both companies were sponsors at this year\u2019s CPAC, leading to a few awkward moments.

But the company was forced to apologize for including a first-person shooter simulation, given that the conference took place a week after the Parkland massacre.  Google, which has co-sponsored CPAC three of the past six years, held a lavish reception for attendees featuring an open bar and a roaring outdoor fireplace.  Mr. Marlow, the editor of Breitbart, was asked in an interview what he thought about Google\u2019s giving a party in the midst of a crowd that is gunning for it.  \u201cThe least they can do,\u201d Mr. Marlow said, \u201cis buy us a drink.\u201d", "stock": "GOOGL"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/24/technology/personaltech/drones-netflix-andes-google-maps.html", "label": 0, "source": "the-new-york-times", "date": "2018-01-24", "article": "How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives?

However, what\u2019s clear after four days of using this, is that it\u2019s an early adopter\u2019s product. In the Indian context, it\u2019s not a product that will serve any real purpose in your life, at least not yet.  I have always maintained that AI platforms become slightly dumber in India. Yet, if we were to compare the level of intelligence these platforms are capable of, the Google Assistant would almost always come out shining, just ahead of Amazon\u2019s Alexa and followed by Microsoft\u2019s Cortana.  Yeah, let's not even talk about Siri here.  In India, smart assistants are still learning. If these were real people, the Indian versions of these assistants would be the equivalent of school children, while global/US versions feel more intelligent, like college kids. It's a long way to adulthood either way.  And on that note, let's talk about the Google Home. A smart home product, that, like the Amazon Echo, has been talked about in some detail. So much so that you may even be expecting the one speaker to rule them all here.  Alas! Amazon couldn't do it and neither can Google. I'll skip over the bits about design here since my global colleagues have written about it already.  Using the Google Home in India  Like the Echo before it, the Home is very much an early adopter\u2019s product in India. The primary difference is that unlike other such products, it's not big riddled and gives you the full experience of what you can expect.  That said, there's work to be done as far as app support etc. are concerned. The Home plays music from Play Music only right now. So, when you ask for a song, it will search through Google's catalogues and find the best match. Often, that isn't close to being right. A tad too often to be honest.  I asked the Home to play \u2018New York, New York\u2019 by Frank Sinatra. It played \u2018One For My Baby\u2019 by the same artist. Google\u2019s My Activity page shows what the Home heard: \u201cPlay up the road by Frank Sinatra\u201d. So, it found the closest match.  The My Activity page also tells me that I asked it to \u201cplay tennis\u201d once. I surely didn't. However, it was up to the task when I asked it to \u201cplay some Michael Buble\u201d or \u201cplay Havana\u201d. The margin for error here is the same as the Echo, and having used the Echo for just over six odd months now, I'm pretty accustomed to it.  In hindsight, the Echo started off similarly, before getting used to my accent and pronunciation. And it still misses at times. I'm hoping Google's AI copes better and learns faster.  What I don't like though is how often the Home just doesn't register a command. I've had to modulate my voice quite often with the Home. That's especially frustrating when you wake up in the middle of the night and ask for something.  The Home just sat there often, while I screamed - \u201cHey Google\u201d, \u201cOk, Google\u201d, \u201cOii! Google\u201d and more. To be clear, only the first two commands would and should have woken the speaker up. The Home seems to go into a slumber at times and refuses to wake up.  When it does listen, I can ask for reminders to be set, jokes to be told, time, travel info and more. Pretty much anything that the Google Assistant can do, the Home can do, too.  Smart Home  I had a lone Philips Hue Ambiance bulb to test the Home with. The Hue\u2019s smart home Bridge needs to be set up before the Google Home can control it. The Home and Hue Bridge have to be on the same WiFi network for this to work.  You can toggle the intensity of the Hue Ambiance or turn it on/off using the Home. Once set up, you can control it from anywhere using the Google Assistant, as long as you're connected. I had the Home and Echo dot placed side-by-side on the same network, and the lag time between command and activity are the same on both.  Setting up the Hue is obscenely easy. The Home app by Google has a \"Home Control\" section. You head over here, tap on the \"+\" icon and add devices. Done. The Home asks for your Philips Hue account and automatically connects the Hue Bridge you set up earlier.  The Hue Ambiance is rather limited in what it can do, but the Home can control the full suite of things other Hue bulbs can do.  Controlling smart homes though is a niche utility in India, to say the least. The Hue Ambiance, which is the cheapest in Philips' portfolio, is priced at just over Rs 2,000 here. Other Hue bulbs often touch upwards of Rs 10,000. If you're already invested in IoT products, the Home might be a good idea.  What remains to be seen is whether the ecosystem develops around this. Google boasts extensive support for smart home products, though most of the brands aren't doing business in India just yet. Like Amazon, the company will have to push for these brands to start selling here.  App support  Amazon boasts over 10,000 skills for Alexa in India, so Google needs to catch up. That said, the Assistant already has a bunch of usable skills in the country.  Yet, the Home lacks app support. It has support for Gaana and Saavn at the moment and Google says it wants to add more. However, apps like Uber and all others need to be added.  The brightside is that support for Google Cast covers a lot of your media requirements. Apps like Pocket Casts, Wynk and some others can stream to the Home directly via Google Cast.  Audio Quality  The Home and Echo aren't meant to be audio products. Yet, if you do buy a speaker, the audio experience is worth noting. What I can confirm here is that the Home sounds decidedly better than the Echo. Michael Buble's baritone voice sounds better and more detailed on the Home when compared to the Echo. The music experience, in general, is richer too.  As a standalone speaker, the Home is more versatile than the Echo. It's loud enough to fill a room or two - though that would really depend on the size of your rooms. I have 10x10 rooms in my house, which are well served.  That said, don\u2019t go expecting UE Boom/Wonderboom-level audio quality.  Summing up  It's been just four days with the Home, so I can't quite pass a weighty verdict yet. But, as I said before, the Google Home is an early adopter's product. If you're buying this, you're either gifting it to a geek or a geek yourself.  It doesn't have real usage that will change your life. It's not a product you NEED, it's a product you really, really want. For those who do buy it, the novelty will wear off in a few weeks, after which we'll have to wait till India catches up with the global standards in smart homes.  If Google is to sell this to the general public, it will have to have offline stores to show the Home. It\u2019s an experiential product. One that you want only after you\u2019ve...umm...spoken to it.  Price and offers  The Google Home is priced at Rs 9,999 in India, while the Home Mini will sell for Rs 4,499. Both products are available on Flipkart and retail stores like Croma, Reliance Digital, Vijay Sales and more.  Google is also bundling a JioFi router and \u201cstreaming music subscriptions\u201d with the Home. If you buy the product at Reliance Digital stores, you will get a JioFi router with 100GB 4G data, while Croma outlets will bundle the Philips Hue with the Home and Home Mini.", "stock": "GOOGL"}, {"url": "https://www.techradar.com/reviews/google-wifi", "label": 1, "source": "techradar", "date": "2018-04-11", "article": "Google Wifi is the easiest and most manageable router that we\u2019ve ever set up, period. It might not be the most powerful or offer precise controls, but it more than makes up for any lack of depth in unmatched simplicity.  As devices like Netgear Orbi and Eero have shown: the age of routers and range extenders has ended. The future is tri-band or Wi-Fi mesh systems. And, surprising no one, the smart-home obsessed Google is all over it with the eponymous Google Wifi  And, it turns out that Google may have very well crafted the best Wi-Fi mesh system yet. Google\u2019s managed to create a system that offers more mesh units than competitors at a lower price, and a focus on simple setup and management. The result? We never want to look at another router again.  Price and availability  Unsurprisingly, Google doesn\u2019t ask for a lot of money for what\u2019s on offer. Google Wifi costs $279 (about \u00a3197, AU$360) for a set of three units \u2013 that\u2019s one primary \u2018WiFi Point\u2019 (the one you hook up to the modem or gateway) and two secondary WiFi Points.  In the UK, Google Wifi comes with a two unit set costing \u00a3229.  A single Google Wifi unit can be had for $119 (around \u00a384, AU$153). Google promises that three Wifi Points can cover up to 4,500 square feet (418 square meters) in a home.  Unfortunately, at the time of writing, Google has made no mentions of pricing or availability in Australia. However, when we spoke to Google just before the UK launch, it suggested that it was looking to release Google Wifi globally in the future.  Google offers more units for less money than any competitor, like the Netgear Orbi, with all others costing at least $400 (about \u00a3320, AU$520) for the same amount.  Spec Sheet Wireless Connectivity: IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, AC1200 2x2 Wave 2 Wi-Fi (expandable mesh; dual-band 2.4GHz and 5GHz, TX beamforming); Bluetooth Smart ready Processor: Quad-core ARM CPU (each core up to 710MHz) Memory: 512MB RAM Storage: 4GB eMMC flash Beamforming: Implicit and Explicit for 2.4 & 5GHz bands Ports: 2 x Gigabit Ethernet ports per Wifi point (1 WAN and 1 LAN port each) Dimensions: 4.1 x 2.7 inches (106.1 x 68.7mm; D x H) each Weight: 12oz (340g) each  Design and setup  Not only does Google have the clear advantage of pricing on its hands, but it also has the best-designed individual units and easiest setup of any offering. Each Google Wifi unit, a tiny, unassuming cylinder with a simple white LED band in its center, is capable of the same functionality.  This means that any of the three units could function as the \u201crouter\u201d of the system, while the others can bestow wired internet (which is beamed to the unit wirelessly) with their included Ethernet ports as well as wireless internet. All three units are powered via USB-C.  Setup is as sublime as Google\u2019s hardware design, using a free iOS and Android app to facilitate the process. While we won\u2019t belabor you with the entire procedure, but the app configures your Wi-Fi network by first scanning the QR code on the Wifi Points connected to your modem or gateway and power.  From there, the app tells you to name your network and set a password, then pair the additional Wifi Points and label them in the app for reference. Again, it takes seconds for the \u201crouter\u201d to recognize the Wifi Points and for them to begin broadcasting.  But, you\u2019re not going to get the same depth of access as even Netgear Orbi provides, so no band switching for you. However, Google Wifi handles this in the background automatically.  However, the app offers plenty more useful features, like constant monitoring of your network, its Points and the devices connected to it. The app has an included internet speed test similar to that of Ookla\u2019s, a mesh test that measures the health of your Points\u2019 connections as well as a Wi-Fi test that measures your connection strength from within the network.  You can also prioritize bandwidth to one device for a time, control smart home devices and pause internet access to certain devices in a family setting \u2013 all from within this app.  By far, this is the most complete and elegant suite of control settings we\u2019ve seen from a Wi-Fi mesh system so far, despite its lack of dropdown boxes and toggles.  Benchmarks Here is how the Google Wifi fared in our brief suite of tests (conducted on a 100Mbps service): Ookla Speed Test 5GHz (Download | Upload): Within 5 feet/1.52 meters; no obstructions: 101.41 | 117.83 Mbps Within 13 feet/3.96 meters; three plaster walls: 97.05 | 118.67 Mbps Ookla Speed Test 2.4GHz (Download | Upload): Within 5 feet/1.52 meters; no obstructions: 47.53 | 96.72 Mbps Within 13 feet/3.96 meters; three plaster walls: 50.95 | 82.98 Mbps 1.5GB Steam download 5GHz (peak speed): Within 5 feet/1.52 meters; no obstructions: 12.6 MB/s Within 13 feet/3.96 meters; three plaster walls: 12.2 MB/s 1.5GB Steam download 2.4GHz (peak speed): Within 5 feet/1.52 meters; no obstructions: 7.2 MB/s Within 13 feet/3.96 meters; three plaster walls: 8.8 MB/s  Performance  We\u2019ve seen just as impressive, if not better, performance from the Google Wifi system as we have Netgear Orbi. Google Wifi draws the absolute most from our 100Mbps Wi-Fi service that we\u2019ve seen any router able to, but can do so from every room of our, albeit small, house.  We\u2019ve been able to stream 4K video through Netflix to our Roku Premiere in the basement as well as we\u2019ve been able to play Overwatch in the office where the modem is located: without issue. Wi-Fi mesh systems like Google Wifi aren\u2019t focused so much about throughput as they are coverage, but this product delivers regardless.  The traffic prioritization feature can ensure that your gaming session is getting more of that crucial bandwidth than the other devices in your house that are Facebooking and streaming HD video.  Plus, the network can automatically repair itself should one or more of the Wifi Points be accidentally unplugged or otherwise lose power.  While we know that Google Wifi operates its mesh system over existing Wi-Fi bands (2.4GHz and 5GHz) over the 802.11s mesh protocol rather than Netgear Orbi\u2019s tri-band system that communicates over a second 5GHz Wi-Fi band, we haven\u2019t found a terrible difference between either\u2019s performance. We do see slightly faster download speeds in MB/s on the 2.4GHz band from the Orbi over the Google Wifi, but that could also be an anomaly.  The true benefit of Google Wifi over others is, simply put, its coverage for the price. You can get equal amounts of coverage in pure square footage from competing systems with fewer units, but the versatility having more units gives you in terms of shoring up dead spots can\u2019t be ignored.  We liked  Google Wifi is incredibly easy to setup and manage on a day-to-day basis despite its lack of some finer control. The fact that the system includes three units for less than some competitors charge for two or fewer is also a huge benefit. Finally, these units look even better in terms of design than systems like Netgear Orbi, and are much easier to hide in plain sight.  We disliked  While there isn\u2019t much to gripe about regarding Google Wifi, some might like finer control over Wi-Fi settings, like controlling which bands are broadcast and when. Also, as it uses AC1200 technology, Google Wifi isn\u2019t capable of the AC3000 or even AC2200 throughput that Netgear Orbi and Linksys Velop are, respectively, which might turn off those paying big for super-fast internet speeds.  Final verdict  Google Wifi is the easiest router that we\u2019ve ever set up, period. And, that\u2019s considering the two extra devices required to complete it. For a relatively affordable price, Google offers more units than most competitors and the best setup and management app by far.  For all of the finer hardware controls it lacks, Google considered every toggle and test it could present in an easily understandable way through its app. (There\u2019s even bandwidth priority control.)

The Google Assistant-powered speakers were first showcased in October, where Google also announced a bigger Google Home Max AI-based speaker. However, the Home Max has not made it to India alongside its smaller siblings.  Both the smart speakers function on voice commands and can perform tasks like cast audio and video, play music, get answers from Google, set reminders, tell you about your day, control smart home devices and lot more.  To make Google Assistant more relevant for Indian users, Google has added Indian customisations to the speaker. The company recently introduced Hindi language support with 10 other regional languages. Also, the Assistant now is better at recognising the Indian accent. To expand the content on Google Home, the company has partnered with multiple homegrown companies.  Google Home and Home Mini price and availability  Google Home and Google Home Mini will be priced at Rs 9,999, and Rs 4,499 respectively and will be available for purchase online exclusively on Flipkart, and in over 750 retail stores across the country including Reliance Digital, Croma, Bajaj Electronics, Vijay Sales, Sangeetha, and Poorvika.  Google Home Mini is available in two colours \u2013 Chalk and Charcoal \u2013 while Google Home will be available in Chalk. Coral will be coming soon.  Launch offers  Customers buying Google Home or Google Home Mini on Flipkart you get a free JioFi router along with special offers on exchange and streaming music subscriptions. Buying a Google Home at Reliance Digital or MyJio stores will get you a free JioFi router with 100GB of high-speed 4G data (worth Rs 2,499), and at select Philips Hue and Croma outlets you get a Philips Hue + Google Home Mini at a special bundled price.  Also ACT Fibernet retail customers subscribing to 12-month advance rental plans of 90MBPS and above, will receive a Google Home Mini.

As a Google handset it\u2019s also got a big name behind it, and like any big-name smartphone there\u2019s a wide range of cases available for the Pixel.  These range from the sleek and minimalist, to the strong and bulky, to multi-purpose cases, arty covers and more, so there\u2019s sure to be one that fits your needs and tastes.  Below, you\u2019ll find several recommendations that cover a wide range of budgets and style preferences. While some of these options are untested, they are each a cut above the rest due to their value and design, and are backed by positive consumer feedback.  Note: we've ranked these from cheapest to most expensive according to prices at time of writing.  Spigen Liquid Crystal Case  A cheap, slimline option  Colors: Crystal Clear | Material: TPU  Shows off your phone  Cheap  Minimal protection  Made of plastic  The Spigen Liquid Crystal case has a lot going for it, starting with the fact that it\u2019s very cheap, which is handy for anyone who\u2019s already stretched their budget buying the Pixel.  But despite its low price the Liquid Crystal is well-designed, with a slim and light form-fitting build, that maintains the shape of your handset, and being transparent it also maintains the Pixel\u2019s looks, so if you\u2019re a fan of the phone\u2019s unusual metal and glass design you won\u2019t have to hide it away.  It\u2019s not the most protective case around, but it\u2019s easy to put on, resists smudges and should keep your Pixel safe from minor scrapes and falls.  Spigen Rugged Armor Case  Serious protection at minimal cost  Colors: Black | Material: TPU  Durable  Carbon fiber accents  Only comes in black  Chunky  Another Spigen case, but this one has a little bit more going on. You lose the slim transparent design of the Liquid Crystal case, but in its place you get a case which has passed military grade drop tests (which apparently means being dropped 26 times from a height of 48 inches and surviving).  The Spigen Rugged Armor achieves this thanks to a spider web pattern and air cushioned corners on the inside of a TPU shell.  The case isn\u2019t much to look at, but textured carbon fiber accents mean it\u2019s more than just a nondescript black block.  Credit: Amazon  Caseology Parallax case  Stylish protection that doesn't add too much bulk  Colors: Black, Burgundy, Navy Blue | Material: TPU and PC  Lots of protection from every angle  Stylish for a low price  May be too bulky for some  Cases that offer lots of protection are usually bulky as all get out, but Caseology has basically mastered the art of doing the exact opposite. This dual-layer case protects the Google Pixel at every angle, even lifting the screen off a tablet to avoid micro scratches, and it looks good to boot.  This case's price has fallen since it debuted, meaning that it's now very affordable to pick up one of Caseology's Parallax cases in the color of your choice on the cheap.  Credit: VRS Design / Amazon  VRS Design High Pro Shield  A protective case for mobile media fans  Colors: Dark Silver, Really Blue, Satin Silver | Material: Polycarbonate and TPU  Lots of protection  Kickstand  Not slim  Made of plastic  The VRS Design High Pro Shield isn\u2019t the slimmest case around, but it\u2019s thinner than you might expect given the level of protection it provides.  The case is certified as offering military grade protection, so you can feel confident that your Pixel is safe, and while made of plastic the High Pro Shield sports a brushed metal effect that helps it stand out from the crowd.  Speaking of metal, there\u2019s also a metal kickstand built in, so you can prop your phone up when watching movies.  Credit: Tetded / Amazon  Tetded Cowhide Leather Case  Real leather with a slim design  Colors: Black | Material: Leather  Genuine leather  Slim  No card slots  Only comes in black  If only real leather will do, then check out the Tetded Cowhide Leather case. It\u2019s one of very few genuine leather Pixel cases at time of writing, and predictably you do pay a premium for it.  But the case undeniably looks good, with a slim profile that avoids adding too much bulk, and a microfiber lining to keep your screen protected when the case is closed.  Pixel Phone Case by Google  A colorful case that fits like a glove  Colors: Gray, Blue, Green, Peach, Coral | Material: Silicone, polycarbonate and microfiber  Lots of color choices  Good fit  Looks cheap  Fairly pricey  If you want a case that\u2019s guaranteed to be a good fit, then look no further than the Pixel Phone Case. This is created by the same team as the Pixel itself, so it fits like a glove.  It also comes in a range of colors to suit almost any style and provides three layers of protection, with a silicone exterior for shock absorption and grip, a polycarbonate core for support and a soft microfiber interior.  Incipio Carnaby Case  An unusual case that's comfortable to hold  Colors: Black, Gray, Olive | Material: TPU, polymer and cotton  Interesting design  Soft feel  Expensive  Mostly plastic  Making a case stand out, without making it look weird, can be a tricky job, but we\u2019d say the Incipio Carnaby succeeds, as on top of the fairly standard plastic shell there\u2019s a layer of cotton, which looks different (in a good way) and makes the case soft to the touch.  Available in three distinct shades, the Carnaby is also strong and shock absorbent, so as well as looking good it does the vital job of keeping your Pixel safe.  OtterBox Commuter  A strong case that protects from damage and dust  Colors: Black, Pink | Material: Polycarbonate and rubber  Drop protection  Keeps dirt and dust out  Bulky  Pricey  OtterBox is a big name in cases and for good reason, with its Commuter case providing serious levels of protection.  An inner rubber cover and outer polycarbonate shell provide two layers of protection, deflecting shocks away from your phone, while port covers keep dirt and dust out.  All of which sounds great on paper, but OtterBox has extensively trialled the case, over more than 238 hours and 24 tests, so you can be sure it lives up to the billing.  Artworks Live Case  Turns your phone into a work of art  Colors: Various | Material: Polycarbonate  Customizable  Unusual  Middling protection  Quite expensive  Most cases are quite plain, but the Artworks Live Case isn\u2019t most cases. As an official Google case you can be confident that it\u2019s well-built, but the real selling point is the ability to apply an artwork to it, for a truly eye-catching cover.  There\u2019s a fairly wide range of images available to choose from, and you can position your artwork of choice however you want on the case, for a unique, custom finish.  Photos Live Case  A case with unlimited options  Colors: Various | Material: Polycarbonate  Can make it your own  Slim fit  Not the most protective case  Could look tacky  If you want even more creative freedom than Google\u2019s Artwork cases offer, then check out the Photos Live Case. This is a similar idea, except you can upload one of your own photos as an image for the case, meaning the possibilities are endless and your Pixel can truly reflect you.  Or if you\u2019re lacking inspiration you could look at the Places Live Case, which lets you select a location from Google Maps, then pick from a range of styles and colors to print it in.", "stock": "GOOGL"}, {"url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/google-images-changes-make-it-better-for-image-creators-worse-for-everyone-else", "label": 1, "source": "techradar", "date": "2018-02-16", "article": "Google has made a significant change to its Google Images search engine, in a bid to prevent people from downloading and copying copyrighted images.  When you now search for an image, you won\u2019t see the \u2018View image\u2019 button. This used to allow people to view just the image on its own, and allow them to download the image without visiting the site.  This caused concern from the people who created and published those images, as not only were their images viewed and downloaded without people having to visit the site, potentially robbing them of an audience, but it also meant the images were viewed out of context, and without any information on usage rights or who to credit if you re-use the image.  Getting those clicks  As the Google search team said on Twitter, while the View Image button is gone, the \u2018Visit\u2019 button remains, hopefully encouraging people to visit the website before downloading the image.  Today we're launching some changes on Google Images to help connect users and useful websites. This will include removing the View Image button. The Visit button remains, so users can see images in the context of the webpages they're on. pic.twitter.com/n76KUj4ioDFebruary 15, 2018  However, you can still right-click the image and select \u2018Open image in new tab\u2019 and download it that way. Still, it\u2019s hoped that this move will make people more aware of where their images come from.  As the Google search team explains, \u201cHaving a single button that takes people to actionable information about the image is good for users, web publishers and copyright holders\u201d, while also revealing that these changes have come about in part due to a settlement earlier this week with Getty Images.  Getty Images filed a competition law complaint against Google with the European Commission in 2016, which accused Google of \u201ccreating captivating galleries of high-resolution, copyrighted content. Because image consumption is immediate, once an image is displayed in high-resolution, large format, there is little impetus to view the image on the original source site.\u201d  Google and Getty Images have now embarked on a multiyear global licencing partnership to solve this issue. While this change will be welcomed by many image creators, it may prove frustrating for day-to-day users who are searching for images for legitimate purposes.  The \u2018Search by image\u2019 button has also been removed, making it harder to search for similar images, however, reverse image search still works.", "stock": "GOOGL"}, {"url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/the-google-pixel-is-no-longer-sold-on-the-google-store", "label": 1, "source": "techradar", "date": "2018-04-10", "article": "Your search for the original Google Pixel just got more difficult as the phone maker has confirmed to TechRadar that it delisted the 2016 phone from its global online storefront.  Sold alongside the Google Pixel 2 and Google Pixel 2 XL as the more affordable option, the first-gen Pixel phone has now made way for what is likely to come this October (or sooner): the Google Pixel 3.  It\u2019s news to nobody that products get older and are removed as company\u2019s see fit, and in this case, the Pixel\u2019s delisting isn\u2019t unique. But your search to find a Pixel may get tougher in the near future.  Should you still buy a Pixel?  The price for the Pixel had dropped considerably since its successor launched in October 2017, bringing the Google Pixel down to a much more palatable $549 on the US Google Store in recent months. Despite its disappearance on Google\u2019s store, some carriers like Verizon still stock the phone.  But at this point, is it worth your money? The Pixel is still a great phone by today\u2019s standards and will be updated to Android P later this year, but in hindsight, while we miss the 3.5mm headphone jack, the lack of waterproofing is a big knock against it.

You\u2019ll be able to check on the status of your alarm system from anywhere if you\u2019ve got a connected Google Assistant device, which should include Android phones and Android Wear devices.  What this means is that if you\u2019ve left the house in a rush and forgotten to set your alarm you'll be able to arm the system by giving a voice command to your smartwatch. You can even toggle between the different security modes you\u2019ve got set up on your Secure.  As Nest is a Google company (originally bought by Google, then an Alphabet company, then re-absorbed into Google ), it\u2019s surprising that Google Assistant integration has taken this long to come to the device.  Some set-up required  In February 2018 Google Assistant worked its way into the Nest Cam IQ , effectively turning it into a smart speaker. You won\u2019t get the same functionality here as the Secure lacks the two-way audio that the Cam IQ has, but the feature is live now if you\u2019ve got a Google Assistant speaker and a Nest Secure.  It\u2019s worth noting that the Google Assistant feature won\u2019t work if you\u2019ve got your Nest Secure set up to only arm with a PIN, so you may have to fiddle with your settings a little to take advantage of this new feature.  If you're worried about burglars taking advantage of the voice control feature to disable your alarm the amount of voice control is fairly limited, with the deactivation feature only available in the moments directly after the alarm has been set.

The software update follows on from its introduction in Google Photos for Android, which happened earlier this month.  For those of you not familiar with the tool, it's basically a clever visual search engine: point Lens at a celebrity, or a landmark, or a famous piece of artwork, or a QR code, and it'll give you the necessary information about it. Snap Ed Sheeran in the street, for example, and you get links to his YouTube and Facebook pages, and so on.  As part of Google Photos for Android and iOS, Google Lens can only work on photos you've taken. If you own a Pixel phone, you can get Lens to identify what you're looking at before the shutter button gets pressed (it's in Google Assistant).  Seeing is believing  Google has big plans for Lens, as it made clear at Google I/O last year. Over time the AI underpinning the app will get more sophisticated \u2013 maybe analyzing your meals and counting calories, or something similar.  Apparently, it's also going to be clever enough to remove objects from photos, Photoshop-style \u2013 though that feature and some of the others Google has mentioned haven't been launched yet. Eventually, any kind of AI task related to photos will fall under the Lens job description.  To get your hands on it now and give it a whirl, make sure you're running the latest version of Google Photos for Android or iOS, and open up a picture from your gallery.

The audiobooks will work on Android, iOS, Chromecast, as a web-based application and in any device with Google Assistant. That last one is particularly interesting, as Google\u2019s voice assistant is becoming fairly ubiquitous.  This means you\u2019ll be able to listen to your audiobooks on a vast array of first and third-party smart speakers like the Google Home range, plus Android Wear-powered wearables. It's also coming soon to Android Auto, so you can be entertained while driving, and the service will remember where you are in your novel so you can transition from one to the other without restarting the chapter.  Smarter speaking from your smart speaker  Google is putting the same level of computer learning that you\u2019ll find in its other features into the audiobooks service, allowing you to interact with your books so that rather than just \u2018Track 12\u2019 showing up on your dashboard's display, you\u2019ll get the chapter title, and with the Google Assistant interaction, you can ask for pertinent information about the book like the author\u2019s name.  Smart speakers are well known for their timers, and Google Play audiobooks takes full advantage of this, allowing you to set a countdown timer for when to stop reading, so if you want to delegate the reading of your child\u2019s bedtime story to your Google Home, you can. Although there\u2019s nothing to stop the little nipper from requesting more stories.  Talking of family, one of the things that sets Google\u2019s offering apart from Amazon\u2019s Audible is the family sharing feature. With Audible, you\u2019re able to share an audiobook with one other adult in your Amazon Household. With Google, you can share with up to five other people in your family.  The Google Home Max speaker  We asked Greg Hartrell, Google Books Product Manager, about Google's definition of family, if you had to be biologically related to them, he had this to say:  \u201cWe don't have an opinion on the various definitions of families. You set up a family account by going to Google Play, the head of the household puts on a payment instrument, and up to five people can get added to that family account. And since there are many definitions of a family, we hope that people use that experience to have their family enjoyed their audiobooks together.\u201d  So if your family happens to be your book club, that looks like it\u2019s all part of the plan. That\u2019s not the only differentiator, and the next is probably going to be the most appealing for those that aren\u2019t regular readers but want to dip their toe in to the world of audiobooks:  \u201cThis is an a la carte model with prices below list,\u201d continued Hartrell, \u201cmaking it affordable and easy to try, and there's no commitment meaning that you can listen to as many or as few as you want without a subscription.\u201d  Available titles in the US include Ready Player One ($6.99), Fire & Fury: Inside the Trump White House ($8.99), Murder on the Orient Express ($4.99), Lincoln in the Bardo ($8.99), 1984 ($5.99) and The Girl on the Train ($6.99).  Okay Google, why now?  It makes sense for Google to be getting into audiobooks now, with Google Assistant looking set to live within all sort of smart home devices, and as Hartrell puts it:  \u201cThe audio publishers association in America published a statistic that the sales of audiobooks have grown double digits year over year and that's growing faster than any other book format.\u201d  In the smart speaker market, Google managed to release the Home range long after Amazon\u2019s Echo range hit the shelves and still became a major competitor.

Google Assistant in Hindi is not as skilful as the English one, but it is likely to improve in coming months. The search giant has not made an official announcement on the update, but Google\u2019s confirmation on JioPhone and Assistant integration is a hint.  To start using Google Assistant in Hindi, you must have an Android Phone running Android 5.0 or later. The phone language must be set to English (India).  When I first heard about the update, my expectations were totally opposite of what Google Assistant did. Sadly, the Hindi support is more like an irritating gimmick where you\u2019ll end up speaking in English.  For instance, when I ask Assistant \u2018Kaise ho\u2019 meaning how are you in Hindi, Google replies with \u2018I\u2019m fine\u2019, which is good. Upon asking \u2018Mausam kaisa hai\u2019, meaning how\u2019s the weather in Hindi, Google shows the weather. But sadly, during my experience, Assistant replied English every time I asked something. Moreover, it failed to understand my speech 60% of the times and showed random results.  Since Google hasn\u2019t given a word on this update, it is too early to be critical about the feature.

Sadly, October came and went with no such announcement. Sure, there are Chromebooks like the Pixelbook that can run Android apps through the Google Play store, but Andromeda, referred internally as Fuchsia at Google, runs deeper than that.  We\u2019re expecting Google Fuchsia to take over as Google\u2019s singular, united OS for phones, tablets and laptops.  Whether it supports the full-fat version of Google Docs, fully utilizing Google Drive or finding your favorite app on the Google Play Store, you\u2019ll be able to do whatever from whichever Google Fuchsia powered device you choose. Even better, you\u2019ll be able to pick up wherever you left off on any app from any other Fuchsia device.  For as excited as we are for Fuchsia, even after running early versions, we\u2019re still in the early days of Fuchsia \u2013 likely far out from seeing Google laptops and phones running on this OS. Until then, you can try it out for yourself if you have a spare bootable USB stick lying around.  Cut to the chase  What is it? An Android-meets-Chrome, multi-device operating system  An Android-meets-Chrome, multi-device operating system When is it out?

Likely nothing, as is with Android and Chrome  A Google Pixelbook running an early version of Fuchsia OS (Image Credit: Ars Technica)  What is Google Fuchsia?  Again, Google Fuchsia is a hybrid OS that is still very much in development. The entirety of Fuchsia OS is comprised of two distinct but connected user interfaces (UI): a phone-centric one codenamed \u2018Armadillo\u2019 and a traditional desktop UI known as \u2018Capybara\u2019 internally, according to 9to5Google .  So far, more is known about the mobile version of Fuchsia than the laptop one, but ArsTechnica was recently able to get Fuchsia running on a Google Pixelbook in an awfully early state. Furthermore, 13-year-old indie developer Noah Cain has since created a working version of Fuchsia\u2019s Capybara design, 9to5Google has more recently reported.  'Fuchsia is going to accomplish much of what Microsoft and Apple already have in Windows 10 and iOS-to-macOS Sierra Continuity, respectively, but in a very Google way.'  Dividing the OS up into two separate UI based on the hardware it\u2019s being used with is a classically Microsoft-inspired move. Windows 10 already scales depending on whether it\u2019s being used with a desktop computer, phone, tablet or game console. In fact, Windows 10\u2019s only unifier is its kernel, the root code that controls the bulk of the operating system.  In the case of Fuchsia, that kernel is known as \u2018Zircon\u2019, and it\u2019s designed to be consistently upgradeable in addition to being safe from applications accessing it constantly, adding an extra layer of security and eliminating situations in which apps are rendered incompatible with OS updates.  Whether it\u2019s in the mobile or desktop orientation, Fuchsia is laden with Google\u2019s Material design found all over its Android and Chrome OS products. Shadows are a big focus on the design aesthetic, using a new Vulkan-based graphics renderer known as \u2018Escher\u2019 to do the job. The result is an interface with more depth to its look than traditionally flat OS products.  Google Fuchsia as it appears on a smartphone device.  Fuchsia is also heavily focused on a cards-based interface, in which every app you open appears inside one of these cards \u2013 plus, you can place multiple apps into a single card. This orients the user around tasks at hand rather than apps. Those apps are expected to look the same across different devices because of a new cross-platform mobile app development framework, developed by Google, known as Flutter.  Beyond that, Google Fuchsia revolves around Google Assistant more deeply accessing and working with your apps and information to provide even more actions and insights. Google has referred to these apps and pieces of information as \u2018entities\u2019, according to a GitHub developer page, and they\u2019re all accessible by Google Assistant on Fuchsia. We\u2019ve even seen a recent demo that further illustrates how deeply ingrained Google Assistant is on Fuchsia.  Finally, Fuchsia wants to be the best cross-device OS to date. To achieve this, Fuchsia uses a new tool known as \u2018Ledger\u2019 by the GitHub community. Ledger, once you\u2019re signed into a Google Account on a Fuchsia device, will automatically save your place in all installed apps across all Fuchsia devices.  All in all, Fuchsia is Google\u2019s attempt to get the best of Chrome and Android into a single operating system that\u2019s more efficient both while you\u2019re using it and when you\u2019re away \u2013 not to mention in between those states or between devices.  This is likely where Fuchsia will make its debut.  Since August 2016, the Google Fuchsia release date has been rumored several times \u2013 only to turn out untrue. These rumors have generally cropped up before Google\u2019s big Google IO developer event in California or, in the case of last October, when we know a big hardware release is imminent.  In February 2018, it was revealed that Google\u2019s former head of Android platform security, Nick Kralevich, had left the Android team to \u201cdefine security\u201d over in the Fuchsia department. Describing it as a \u201cnew, experimental operating system,\u201d Kralevich doesn\u2019t hint at any specific launch window, however it does show where Google is choosing to put its most crucial resources.  This should help frame our expectations for when we should expect to see Fuchsia on shelf-ready devices: most likely not before 2019. However, that doesn\u2019t mean that Google Fuchsia will be absent in 2018, as Google may decide to preview it this year in preparation for a mainstream release in 2019.  At any rate, keep it locked to this page as we draw closer to a possible release date and therefore might have some new information for you.  Is Fuchsia the end of Android as we know it? (Image: \u00a9 GE)  What could Fuchsia mean for Android and Chrome \u2013 and Windows and macOS?  From what we're hearing, Fuchsia seems to be Google's response to Microsoft and Apple's united platforms with one of its own. In turning Android into one of the two biggest smartphone platforms and later popularizing Chrome OS \u2013 and its extensible web-based productivity programs \u2013 in the classroom and workplace, Google itself has become a major player on all platforms.  Again, from the sound of it, Fuchsia is going to accomplish much of what Microsoft and Apple already have in Windows 10 and iOS-to- macOS Sierra Continuity, respectively, but in a very Google way. It's easy to expect access to Google's inimitable search and data-tracking at your fingertips \u2013 Google Assistant and \u2018entities\u2019, anyone? \u2013 which it would tout as better than Microsoft and Apple's, and an interface that changes based on the device from which it's accessed.  Will this eventually mean the end of Android and Chrome? In name, most likely, but their principles will almost certainly live on \u2013 there's too much solid foundation not to build on top of them. Just look at the Material design language found throughout these early builds of either version of Fuchsia.  The end result, likely to be seen in a preview form later this year and in purchasable devices in 2019, will be just one platform for Google to worry about. With Fuchsia, Google will be able to push new updates and features to all versions at once, simplifying support as well as user understanding.  With that, Google will become that much more formidable a foe to Microsoft and Apple, and that much appealing an option to Android and Chromebook users all over. Who knows, perhaps it will be enough to bring people over from the other side of Microsoft and Apple\u2019s fences.  These are the best Chromebooks we\u2019ve tested to date  Gabe Carey has also contributed to this report", "stock": "GOOGL"}, {"url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/google-pixel-2-cases", "label": -1, "source": "techradar", "date": "2018-03-01", "article": "The Google Pixel 2 and Google Pixel 2 XL aren\u2019t the most fragile phones around, thanks to their partially metal backs and IP67 protection. But like most flagship phones, they don\u2019t come cheap: starting at $649 (\u00a3629, AU$1,079) for the smaller Pixel 2 and $849 (\u00a3799, AU$1,399) out-of-pocket for the Pixel 2 XL.  As such, it\u2019s wise to find some protection for your investment. Most enthusiasts don\u2019t want to cover up the lush design of their phone, and we totally understand why, but the last thing you want is to send it away for repair.  Below, you\u2019ll find several case recommendations that cover a wide range of budgets and style preferences. While we\u2019ve personally used most of the following cases, some of these options are untested. Nevertheless, we\u2019re confident that each entry is a cut above the rest due to their value and design.  Image 1 of 4 A paper-thin case Image 2 of 4 Fits the Pixel 2 like a glove Image 3 of 4 Peel's case leaves buttons and curved glass exposed Image 4 of 4 You can barely tell it's there  Super Thin Case from Peel  If you\u2019re reluctant to cover up the slim design of the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL, you won\u2019t find a case that\u2019s more trim and thin than Peel\u2019s. It snaps right onto the phone and hugs its curves without adding extra bulk.  Due to this case\u2019s ultra-skinny profile, it\u2019s not a case that you want to put through much turmoil. It prevents micro-scratches, but it likely won\u2019t prevent damage from a drop, and in the case of the Pixel 2 XL, its curved glass isn\u2019t protected in the slightest.  All said, Peel\u2019s cases make an excellent impression on design geeks, and so long as you\u2019re cool with its flimsiness, you won\u2019t find a case that better accentuates the Pixel 2\u2019s look.  Check out the case right here: (Pixel 2) (Pixel 2 XL)  Incipio Multi Stripes case  It's surprisingly hard to find a Pixel 2 case that adds some wild flair, but Incipio's fits the bill, but for more than just being vibrant.  At its affordable asking price, it cradles Google's phone real close \u2013 even providing a lip over the screen to prevent scratches or cracks from accidentally sliding it on the table face-first.  Let's be honest, the best thing about this case is that it just looks nice. Most of us here consider the Pixel 2 to be a good-looking phone, but if you've got to protect it, you might as well add some style.  Image 1 of 4 This case doesn't add much bulk Image 2 of 4 It matches the look of the Pixel 2 nicely Image 3 of 4 The buttons preserve their 'click' through the case Image 4 of 4 The case raises above the glass to protect the screen  Fabric Phone Case from Google  Google\u2019s own case for Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL does well at maintaining the slim look and feel of the phones. Unlike the other options on this list, this one adds microfiber material to the list, giving it a classy look that enhances the grippiness in hand.  We like this case for several reasons. Its price is tolerable, it\u2019s available in a few different colors (Carbon is pictured, but Cement, Midnight and Coral are for sale) and it makes all of the Pixel 2\u2019s features easily accessible. The buttons are effortless to push, making it feel like there\u2019s no case on at all. It also raises the phone\u2019s front so that the glass display isn\u2019t grazing any surfaces.  The only downside in our experience is that fuzz from your pocket gets into the grooves near the screen. Simply wiping it away cleans things up, but it\u2019s annoying to have to do that each and every time you pull it out. Also, the bottom of the phone near the charging port isn\u2019t protected on the front, which subjects it to scratching.  This one's currently available on Amazon in a few different color varieties, but if you can't find it, head to the links below.  Image 1 of 4 See the cases's two layers? Image 2 of 4 Image 3 of 4 Makes the buttons nice and clicky Image 4 of 4 Protects the phone from all corners while maintaining a low profile  Live Case from Google  It should be no surprise that Google\u2019s cases don\u2019t fuss with their phones\u2019 design too much. The Live Case is a more durable option over the Fabric Case, giving it two levels of protection. To pop it on, there\u2019s a silicon case that\u2019s protected by a tough shell that has the design of your choice on it.  Every angle of the Pixel 2 is protected here, including the camera and screen. The buttons feel nice to press and better yet, the Live Case functionality is interesting. Your phone's wallpaper can match the look of the case by downloading the Live Case app and putting in the code that's printed on its inside.  Removing and reapplying the Live Case takes a bit of practice, though we never felt like it was close to breaking. All in all, this case is best if making something custom is a high-priority for you.  You should be able to find a nice variety of pre-designed Live Cases on discount through Amazon, but should you want to customize, head to the links below.  Image 1 of 4 This case has quite the bumper Image 2 of 4 You'll encounter a bit of bulk here Image 3 of 4 The buttons feel a bit stiff under the protective layer Image 4 of 4 This case adds bezels to an otherwise bezel-lite phone  Evo Check Case from Tech21  While not the most rugged case in its design, the Evo Check case by Tech21 is taking us into options that add a fair amount of bulk to the Pixel 2.  This case fits the Pixel 2 snugly, adding on the company\u2019s FlexShock barrier to make it drop-friendly from distances up to 10 feet. Overall, it strikes a nice balance between form and function, showing off the Pixel 2\u2019s design highlights while making sure to protect it from all sides.  Google\u2019s cases on this list provide better button feedback. Here, the phone\u2019s buttons felt a little too difficult to push in, though it\u2019s possible that they might loosen up over time. But we\u2019re a fan of this case\u2019s added grip factor and the mesh design.  They're also available from the Tech21 site: Pixel 2 | Pixel 2 XL  Image 1 of 4 This case looks low profile without the Pixel 2 inside Image 2 of 4 But the phone looks fossilized in amber once popped in Image 3 of 4 The buttons are a little too tough to press, but still functional Image 4 of 4 A smaller, slightly less protective barrier than Tech21's case  Presidio Clear Case from Speck  This clear case from Speck is durable, yet simplistic in design \u2013 an impressive feat given how robust of a protector it is. If you\u2019re after a rugged case that has hints of a slimline look and feel, this is one to look out for.  Once the Pixel 2 is slid into the Presidio Clear, it\u2019s protected from dropping from up to eight feet. Sure, it\u2019s less than the 10 feet guaranteed by Tech21\u2019s option, but Speck\u2019s case shows off the design of the phone a bit better.  Some complain that this case makes holding the phone a more slippery affair, however, we haven't noticed this yet in our testing. This sort of thing certainly depends on how oily the case becomes, either through body oils or from touching it after eating.  Incipio Reprieve Sport 2.0 case  The low-profile build of a slimline case combined with a textured rim and bumper-packed corners describes the look and feel of the Incipio Reprieve Sport 2.0.  It's not the cheapest case around, but unlike slimmer options, this one will offer protection from every angle without masking the Pixel 2's look.  We always appreciate when a rugged case yields responsive buttons and easy access to ports, and to that end, this one is worth checking out in your favorite color.  Bellroy Leather case  Google has partnered up with Bellroy as one of its premium 'Made for Google' providers, and the fruits are stunning.  The Bellroy Leather case comes in a variety of color options for both the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL, and doesn't really cost as much you might think.  The leather on its back is supple and smooth, transitioning into matte plastic running around the trim of your device. Bellroy's case doesn't provide button extenders, but pushing them in doesn't require any additional effort.  This case gives off a really high-end look and those looking to suit the Pixel 2 up as nice as you dress yourself, you'll be pleased with Bellroy's latest.  Kerf wood case  There's something that your Pixel 2 or Pixel 2 XL is missing. It's wood, yep wood. Kerf makes its own phone cases by hand, complete with a flattering design, and backs it with a lifetime warranty.  Not just any regular wooden case would impress us, but this one \u2013 even at the low-end $69 walnut option \u2013 is a top option if you want to protect your Pixel 2.  The buttons are responsive, the suede inside cradles the form factor perfectly and heck, it just smells good.

Google makes money by licensing its apps (including Gmail, Google Maps, Google Play Music and the Google Play Store) to manufacturers, letting them pre-install them on devices on the condition that they meet a set of stringent compatibility requirements. However, the apps are often distributed illegally on third-party sites \u2013 an activity the company wants to stop.  When a user tries to log into one of Google's apps on an uncertified device, they will now be shown an error screen advising them to return it to the retailer if it was sold that way, or register it with Google if they're running a custom ROM.  Registration involves tying the device to your Google account by logging in and entering your Android ID \u2013 a string of characters generated each time you perform a factory reset. You can do this up to 100 times, which will be fine for most people, but might prove awkward for hardcore Android fans.

Not only is it beefing up its phones with \"neural engine\" chips to power AI efforts like augmented reality and machine learning, it's also building out its Siri team. The company recently listed 161 open positions and hired Carnegie Mellon's Russ Salakhutdinov last year to head up AI research. Earlier this week, Apple confirmed perhaps its most important hire yet in the space: former Google AI chief, John Giannandrea.  According to Apple, Giannandrea will head up Apple's \"machine learning and AI strategy\" and report directly to CEO Tim Cook. Seeing as Giannandrea was responsible for making AI central to Google's overall strategy, his new role as Apple's AI lead seems to indicate Siri might be getting a serious makeover. And maybe, just maybe, Siri might just learn a few of the following Google Assistant tricks in the process.  Better search  When it comes to search, it'll be difficult for Apple's Siri to really go head-to-head against Google Assistant, simply because Google is the king of search. But there are other ways that Siri could become smarter here. Even though Siri has contextual search -- the ability to answer follow-up questions -- it's wildly inconsistent.  For example, when I asked Siri \"Who is the president of the United States?\" and then followed it up with \"Who is his wife?\" it sometimes misunderstood or misheard me, giving me definitions of the word \"wife\" instead. (It did respond with \"Melania Trump\" once, but only once). When I asked the same question to Google Assistant, it was completely flawless, even offering me a list of Trump's former wives. When I asked more follow-up questions like her age or her height, Google was much more accurate here as well.  Sometimes Siri doesn't give direct answers at all. When I ask Siri \"what sound does a dog make?\" it brings up a list of search results. But when I ask Google the same question, it literally plays an audio file of a dog barking. Sure, I don't expect Siri to answer complicated questions, but it should at least know the answers to basic kindergarten-level queries without bringing up basic search results. Since Giannandrea has experience in both voice-recognition and search, he might be able to influence improvements in this area.  Siri could also stand to improve the overall search experience. Right now, if you ask a question, you'll either get a single page or a list of results. Google presents a list of related answers in a menu underneath, just in case you want to know more about a topic.  Another area that Siri can learn from Google Assistant is simply a better understanding of who you are and have that inform search results. For example, if I tell Google that my favorite team is the San Francisco Giants, it'll simply return the scores of last night's game if I say \"how are the Giants doing?\" or just \"how did my favorite team do last night?\" Siri, on the other hand, would ask me \"Do you mean the New York Giants or the San Francisco Giants?\" every single time. That's just tiresome.  Smart-home integration  Perhaps one of the smartest moves Google has made in recent years is to make its assistant central to its overall hardware strategy. It's not only in phones; it's also in a variety of smart speakers and most of the Nest lineup. This kind of wide cross-platform and cross-disciplinary approach is what Giannandrea was known for, and he could very well implement the same philosophy to Apple as well.  One area that certainly needs a lot of help is how Siri works in the latest Apple HomePod. Sure, it has great audio quality, and it works well with some HomeKit compatible products like the Phillps Hue lights, but its functionality just doesn't compare with Amazon's Echo or Google's Home.  Siri on the HomePod can't even handle multiple timers or, shockingly enough, initiate phone calls. It also doesn't play well with a few key third-party apps -- it can't order an Uber or a Lyft, and it doesn't work with any other streaming music service except for Apple Music. Yes, Siri does work with some apps like WhatsApp, WeChat and Evernote but the list of third-party apps is pretty small compared to its rivals.  Also, Google's Home can recognize people by their voice, Siri on HomePod can't. That means that any ol' stranger can come up to your speaker and access your iMessages unless you set up a restriction beforehand. Seeing as Siri on the iPhone is able to discern voices pretty well, it's surprising that this function was not carried over to the HomePod.  Third-party support  Last but not least is third-party support. Apple traditionally has a walled garden philosophy when it comes to a lot of its products, as you can tell from the HomePod and Apple Music example above. But it might have to eventually let it go. One of the most frustrating things with Siri on the iPhone is that it seems pretty stunted if you use anything that's not Apple. If you ask it to play a certain song on Spotify, it'll just launch the app without playing anything. If you ask it for directions on Google Maps, the app will open, but you're on your own from there.  Though Google does favor its own apps for some things -- it'll automatically play podcasts from Google Play, for example -- it's at least better with third-party integration than Apple.  Still, it doesn't mean Siri is worse than Google Assistant at everything. As we discovered in our week with Google Assistant, Siri seemed better at pronouncing names and was a little better in the back-and-forth sass department. It was also really good at recognizing voices on mobile -- not just anybody can activate your phone with \"Hey Siri,\" only you can (We should note that Google Assistant can do this too). Plus, since Siri is already baked into your iPhone, it's by far the easiest voice assistant to use if you have an iOS device.  While it's still early days yet in Giannandrea's Apple tenure, if he even takes a few of the lessons he learned from Google and brings them to Apple, it will be an improvement. Let's hope that happens.", "stock": "GOOGL"}, {"url": "http://de.engadget.com/2018/03/28/google-ubernimmt-gif-plattform-tenor/", "label": 1, "source": "engadget", "date": "2018-03-28", "article": "When we started Google Images, we focused on making it easy to find photos and images from across the web.

Despite what Google maintained was a \"non-offensive\" involvement with the Pentagon project, the letter to Pichai claimed that involvement would tarnish the corporation's brand.  \"Amid growing fears of biased and weaponized AI, Google is already struggling to keep the public's trust,\" the internally-circulating petition read, according to The New York Times. \"The argument that other firms, like Microsoft and Amazon, are also participating doesn't make this any less risky for Google.

Two former Google workers allege as much in a class-action lawsuit they filed against the company last week. While they may have difficulty prevailing in court, they make a strong case that Google aggressively promotes a political agenda and is far from a neutral broker of information.  Former Google engineers James Damore and David Gudeman claim they were fired for failing to conform to the company\u2019s progressive culture. Last summer Mr. Damore published what was initially an internal cri de coeur against Google\u2019s \u201cideological echo chamber\u201d that criticized its intolerance for alternative views and suggested biology may make men better suited, on average, for tech jobs. Many Google employees demanded Mr. Damore\u2019s termination and a purge of those who shared his views. Senior managers allegedly told Mr. Damore that he was fired for \u201cperpetuating gender stereotypes.\u201d  Mr. Gudeman was fired after he questioned a Muslim co-worker who claimed he was being targeted by the federal government because of his religion. According to the lawsuit, Google claimed Mr. Gudeman had accused the colleague of terrorism.  Messrs. Damore and Gudeman claim to be victims of sex, race and political discrimination. Discrimination in employment on the basis of race, sex, national origin and religion are prohibited by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. But federal law doesn\u2019t forbid employers to discriminate based on their political or cultural views. So the plaintiffs are suing under California labor law, which prohibits employers from \u201cforbidding or preventing employees from engaging or participating in politics.\u201d Employers also cannot discharge or threaten to terminate employees to coerce them into political action.  To win certification as a class action, the plaintiffs must demonstrate that numerous Google employees suffered a common injury. To win their case, they\u2019ll have to show that Google itself adopted or enforced a policy that forbade employees from engaging in politics and led to systematic discrimination against white, conservative men\u2014or alternatively that Google fired Messrs. Damore and Gudeman to force employees to adopt progressive views.  Google\u2019s likely defense will be that it pledges to \u201ccreate a respectful culture that is free of harassment, intimidation, or unlawful discrimination of any kind,\u201d and that the firing of Messrs. Damore and Gudeman was in furtherance of this policy. But the plaintiffs make a good case that Google has selectively and unfairly enforced its policy, and in doing so has promoted a hostile workplace.  Mr. Damore alleges that after he and some co-workers complained about Google\u2019s ideological conformity and diversity training\u2014\u201cbias busting\u201d seminars on \u201cwhite male privilege\u201d and the like\u2014they were shunned, denounced and punished. One manager sent out a mass email describing Mr. Damore\u2019s memo as \u201crepulsive and intellectually dishonest\u201d and allegedly \u201cpromoted posts that advocated for physical violence\u201d against him. A co-worker emailed Mr. Damore: \u201cYou\u2019re a misogynist and a terrible person. I will keep hounding you until one of us is fired. [Expletive] you.\u201d Mr. Damore says he forwarded the email to the human-resources department and was told to work from home. He was fired soon after. Another manager allegedly threatened to ask Google\u2019s employee-relations department to sift through old posts on Google\u2019s \u201cconservatives@\u201d mailing list for code-of-conduct violations.  The plaintiffs also include nearly 100 pages of employee postings on Google\u2019s chat system that disparage conservatives as well as white men. Several employees circulated a meme asserting that \u201c \u2018America First\u2019 is a slogan for American Nazis\u201d and \u201cyou should absolutely punch Nazis.\u201d  Others posted: \u201cIf you want to increase diversity at Google, fire all the bigoted white men\u201d and \u201cby being a white male you are in a privileged class that is actively harmful to others.\u201d One described Mr. Damore and his supporters as \u201ca cancer within our culture.\u201d Many demonstrated an animus toward Christianity\u2014for instance: \u201cPeople in Indiana are bigots, but they don\u2019t call it bigotry. What do they call it? Religious freedom.\u201d  Managers allegedly maintained \u201cblacklists\u201d of conservatives who were blocked from working on their teams, which thwarted their advancement. One manager who blacklisted an intern because he refused to alter his political views allegedly wrote to a fellow manager: \u201cI don\u2019t think he was aware that there were real consequences for his actions. That might have given him the right motivation to change his beliefs or at least to keep his mouth shut.\u201d  According to the lawsuit, Google \u201crelies on crowdsourced harassment and \u2018pecking\u2019 to enforce social norms (including politics) that it feels it cannot write directly into its policies.\u201d It\u2019s as if the company were using machine learning to program its employees\u2019 politics.  Even if Google prevails in the lawsuit, it may consider whether this is any way to run a business. Ideological uniformity can undermine the ability to connect with disparate consumers and generate innovative ideas. That\u2019s especially true for a company like Google, whose founding mission was to make information \u201cuniversally accessibly and useful.\u201d People with divergent political views may have different ideas about what information is useful.  Silencing alternative views and sheltering employees from uncomfortable ideas, as many colleges do, will surely undermine Google\u2019s own ability to attract creative thinkers. Employee intolerance might have also contributed to its subsidiary YouTube\u2019s censorship in 2016 of conservative PragerU videos. And the Daily Caller reported last week that the search engine was providing selective and inaccurate \u201cfact checks\u201d for conservative, but not liberal, sites.  Google\u2019s Orwellian conceptions of inclusivity and diversity also ought to raise questions about its commitment to an \u201copen internet.\u201d How exactly does it define open?

Photo: Richard B. Levine/Zuma Press  One problem the brilliant minds at Google have yet to solve: How to beat Amazon.com AMZN -1.22% at its own game.  It isn\u2019t for a lack of trying. Over the last couple of years, the internet search giant has aggressively built up its own cloud-computing business and pumped out its own line of smart speaker products\u2014two relatively new businesses that have been wildly successful for Amazon. And that hasn\u2019t been without some success on Google\u2019s part. Its cloud-computing arm is now generating more than $1 billion in revenue every quarter. And its Home line of smart speakers now has about 31% of the U.S. market, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners.  But investors are lukewarm on Google at best. Such was evident on Friday, when the shares of parent company Alphabet Inc. GOOGL -0.12% slid 5% in the wake of its fourth-quarter results, though that only wiped out gains made since the first of the year. By contrast, Amazon\u2019s own results helped its stock defy the market\u2019s brutal selloff to gain nearly 3% for the day\u2014having already run up 17% for the year. For Alphabet, the main issue for investors is the rising costs that Google has to pay partners to direct traffic to its sites. Those traffic acquisition costs totaled $21.6 billion in 2017\u2014up 29% from the previous year. That outpaced the 20% revenue growth for Google\u2019s core advertising business for the year, which weighs on the company\u2019s profitability. Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat noted that the growth rate of these costs should start to moderate early this year. But profitability isn\u2019t why investors favor the retailer over the search engine. Google\u2019s $26.1 billion of operating income last year is about 40% more than Amazon has earned in its entire existence. Nor is it the propensity to make big gambles. The difference is that Amazon has figured out how to make more of its big gambles, such as Prime and its AWS cloud service, drive its accelerating growth. Since 2010, Amazon\u2019s larger revenue base has averaged 28% growth annually while Alphabet\u2019s has averaged 21%. In textbook investing, profits matter over revenue growth, but that doesn\u2019t always hold in tech. Investors won\u2019t return to Google just because it is so profitable. Instead, the company can emphasize successful new businesses like the cloud and better articulate how its ubiquitous Android mobile operating system contributes to growth. If it can do that while keeping its wildly profitable core business clicking, Google can catch up to its rival. Amazon wants to deliver everything you want to your doorstep, anywhere in the world. But the e-commerce giant faces several challenges in its pursuit of a global empire. WSJ's Karan Deep Singh breaks down the basics with the help of an Amazon delivery box.

Get past the absurdity of his framing his grievance in terms of identity politics\u2014he\u2019s a victim of Google\u2019s failure to honor \u201cviewpoint diversity.\u201d Apparently under California law this is a legitimate claim.  Last year\u2019s firing episode at first seemed a case of Google clumsily suppressing dissent over race and gender policies adopted after the company\u2019s workforce was found to be overwhelmingly white and male. Now it seems like something else.  If the postings and emails cited in Mr. Damore\u2019s lawsuit are a reliable indication, founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page have lost control of the culture. Google\u2019s leaders may even be a little afraid of their employees.  Mr. Damore\u2019s firing last year by CEO Sundar Pichai certainly rang of panic at the time. Google explicitly invites freewheeling discussion and provides internal forums for it. Mr. Damore did not, in his famous memo, object to Google\u2019s diversity goals. His ruminations on biology may be jejune, but unwelcome facts are still facts. Witness the work of David Lubinski at Vanderbilt, which goes a long way toward explaining the recruiting frustrations of many a tech and engineering-based company. Prof. Lubinski and colleagues find that women who are gifted in math and science tend to be broadly gifted, and consequently have lots of opportunities in a wide range of fields, whereas men with math talents tend to be narrowly gifted, and all end up in math-science-engineering fields.  Not that Mr. Damore\u2019s lawsuit, in which he is joined by another recently fired male engineer, turns on the validity of his Darwinian musings. In the postings and emails he quotes, colleagues spew hate at Mr. Damore, apparently without consequence.  We see them giving each other employee-awarded \u201cpeer bonuses,\u201d supported by Google\u2019s \u201cRecognition Team,\u201d for denouncing him. We see Google employees explicitly reject talking to, listening to or working with colleagues whose politics they don\u2019t share.  We see them proposing blacklists. One paints as incapable of coming up with anything \u201ccreative or innovative\u201d any meeting consisting of \u201c40-something white men,\u201d and Google HR approves the sentiment. An employee asks if \u201cmen\u201d were changed to \u201cwomen,\u201d would the post still be approved? No response.  Another posting calls on Googlers to decline to participate in industry panels alongside \u201ccheesy white males.\u201d  One Googler who says he refuses to \u201ctolerate\u201d broad categories of people (e.g., Trump voters) might seem regrettable, especially after it turns out he\u2019s German and lives in Switzerland. When it becomes a competition, a cultural disease is at work. Incipient here is a world that people in Google\u2019s home state are already familiar with. It\u2019s the world of California\u2019s maximum-security prison system, where inmates survive only by kneeling to one identity-based gang or another.  If there is a lesson here for other companies\u2014and don\u2019t take this the wrong way\u2014it\u2019s the value, broadly, of \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell.\u201d  To work together on software, people don\u2019t need a company-supplied forum to discuss their politics, their sexual interests, their cultural antipathies. Offering it seems pointlessly divisive.  Perhaps the most symbolically disturbed posting is one demanding that control of Google be wrested from the \u201chorde of racist and sexist people we\u2019ve already hired.\u201d  To be white and male is not to be sexist and racist. The statement \u201cI don\u2019t want to be denied an opportunity because of my gender and race\u201d is as valid for a white male as it is for a black, gay, female or furry. (Yes, Google\u2019s internal discussion board includes consideration of the \u201cfurry\u201d lifestyle, which involves dressing up in animal costumes.)  Some predict Google will quickly settle to avoid discovery of more emails and postings, including from top management. What seems worse, from a public-relations perspective, is a culture inveterately hostile to the liberal principle \u201cI may disagree with what you say but defend your right to say it.\u201d This can\u2019t be good in a business whose mission is to organize the world\u2019s information.  Messrs. Brin, Page and Pichai likely feel a tad helpless. The U.S. legal system imposes a need to be race-aware, gender-aware, etc.\u2014to require quotas in all but name, since quotas are illegal. Google simultaneously faces lawsuits and regulatory investigations directed at its alleged shortchanging of women on pay and promotions.  Its internal mood may also partly be a victim of self-esteem run amok. It\u2019s a wonder many Googlers don\u2019t worship Donald Trump \u2014he also can\u2019t tolerate to be disagreed with. A good, old-fashioned Presbyterian horror of self-righteousness, once a feature of American life, is nowhere to be seen.  Part of growing up is learning to live with your emotions; today\u2019s shortcut is to believe whatever your feelings are, they\u2019re justified. Humanity never met a dictator or demagogue who said, \u201cI\u2019m a bad person.

The time for doubt is over. Last week\u2019s news that Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, is in talks to build a tech hub in the kingdom is only the latest sign. Look for more such initiatives when the crown prince visits the U.S. in early March.  Whatever one may think about Saudi Arabia or its new young strongman, there is no longer any dispute as to his resolve. Prince Mohammed is determined not just to reform the country but to wrench Saudis out of a 30-year torpor that he rightly sees as inexorably leading them toward poverty and instability. The radical change he is imposing isn\u2019t a choice: It is the only choice.  He has inherited a nation of 22 million spoiled children, each of whom wants a cushy life in the national nursery that oil-rich Saudi Arabia used to be. But with crude oil crashing to $26 a barrel in 2016\u2014and even now at almost $70 a barrel\u2014Riyadh can no longer afford the pacifiers to tranquilize its population, not to mention the 10 million foreign workers who have tended to Saudi citizens\u2019 every need.  Prince Mohammed\u2019s Saudi Vision 2030 is a push away from dependence on government and toward self-reliance. To jump-start the transformation, he has instituted social changes no one could have imagined only a few years ago: Saudis are now free to attend concerts and cinemas, and in June women will be driving, all of which were previously forbidden by religious authorities backed by royal rulers.  More significantly, Prince Mohammed has rounded up prominent people accused of financial corruption\u2014royal cousins, cabinet ministers, businessmen\u2014and forced them to turn over what the government says will be $106 billion in exchange for their freedom.  These are shocking tactics in a country accustomed to royal rule through laborious consensus-building among the senior princes. But the truth is that most of these senior princes are now dead. More to the point, that unwieldy method of governance failed for 30 years to wean the country off oil dependence, despite repeated commitments to that end. Prince Mohammed knows the folly of doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result.  Almost since the founding of modern Saudi Arabia in 1932, its stability has rested on three pillars: unity among the royals, their symbiotic cooperation with the Wahhabi religious establishment, and oil wealth. The new crown prince has upended each of these pillars\u2014arresting and humiliating his royal relatives, insisting on moderate Islam and a more open society, and imposing high taxes on the cheap oil that Saudis regard as their birthright.  During my January visit, Saudis were in shock at the social, political and economic changes. In a single week last month, electricity prices tripled, gasoline prices doubled (to roughly $2 a gallon), and the first-ever value added tax, of 5%, was imposed. If asked Ronald Reagan\u2019s famous 1980 debate question\u2014\u201cAre you better off than four years ago?\u201d\u2014almost all Saudis over 30 would say \u201cno.\u201d  The arrests of elite princes and businessmen, as well as conservative religious sheikhs, have chilled older Saudis. During my visit, more than one old acquaintance declined to meet me for \u201chealth\u201d reasons and other polite excuses. But Prince Mohammed\u2019s constituency is not the royal family or the religious sheikhs. It\u2019s the 70% of Saudis who are under 30. He essentially is playing generational Robin Hood\u2014taking from the elite who for decades helped themselves to the nation\u2019s oil revenues, while freeing the young from the smothering hand of Wahhabi sheikhs who sapped Saudi initiative by controlling every aspect of daily life. The crown prince clearly hopes that if citizens are allowed to manage their lives, they will take responsibility for their livelihoods.  This is a brave gamble, but without significant change Saudi Arabia\u2019s future looks dark. The economy is growing more slowly than the population. Domestic oil consumption is rising nearly 6% a year, a trend that would leave Saudis consuming all the Kingdom\u2019s oil production\u2014with none left for export\u2014by 2030. The economy shrank 0.5% last year and is estimated to grow only 1.6% in 2018, according to the International Monetary Fund, though the Saudi government projects faster growth of 2.7%. The official unemployment figure is 12.7% nationally, but it\u2019s nearly double that for men between 20 and 29 and 33% for young women in that age group.  Prince Mohammad\u2019s economic transformation represents a huge task. If that isn\u2019t enough, he also confronts a hegemonic and meddling Iran, a feud with Qatar, and a war in Yemen. Knowing the price Saudi Arabia has paid for decades of dithering, the crown prince has dared to impose rapid top-down change. Inevitably he will make some mistakes. Those he can repair. More troublesome is that some Westerners whose investment and support he seeks may insist on seeing Saudi Arabia as stuck like a fossil in its past Wahhabism and limited personal freedoms. While the Saudis are far from perfect on human rights, the West should acknowledge that the recent progress is real.  The biggest risk remains the economy: It is far from clear that Prince Mohammed can transform the country fast enough to meet the pent-up ambitions of young Saudis. The West has a stake in doing what it can to assure his success. A collapse that turns Saudi Arabia into another chaotic Iraq or theocratic Iran would be a disaster for the region and the world. Right now, the young prince with his agenda for radical change is Saudi Arabia\u2019s best, and probably only, shot at moderate\u2014and modernizing\u2014reform.

The Duopoly now captures 83% of all digital ad revenue growth and 73% of U.S. digital advertising, according to a CNBC report. As a result, newspapers\u2019 online audience growth does not produce revenue to match. According to data from Pew, newspaper advertising revenue fell from $22 billion in 2014 to $18 billion in 2016 even as web traffic for the top 50 U.S. newspapers increased 42%.  Local news is most at risk. As print circulation declines, community news publishers have the hardest time adapting to the ever-changing demands of Facebook and Google algorithms. We think of \u201cfake news\u201d as a national phenomenon, but in the absence of a workable news business model, wild rumors and conspiracy theories could become more influential at the local level, too.

Photo: Elise Amendola/Associated Press  Google and Facebook have become the primary and de facto regulators of the news business, and governments around the world are starting to recognize the danger. British Prime Minister Theresa May announced earlier this month that her government would review the economics of internet news consumption. Regulators in Germany, Israel and South Korea are investigating how Google\u2019s business practices have disrupted the media market and harmed publishers and consumers. U.S. regulators, on the other hand, have rarely looked into Google or Facebook\u2014and never at their influence in the news marketplace.  Some voices on the left and right are calling for Google and Facebook to be regulated as utilities. But there is an easier solution: exempt news publishers from certain aspects of antitrust regulation.  U.S. antitrust laws, designed to promote fair competition and prevent consolidation, actually make it harder for traditional news outlets to compete with Silicon Valley giants. Under current law, for instance, news publishers cannot get together and agree to withhold their product unless they receive a return on their investment. Let\u2019s start by changing that simple inequity. News publishers should be able to use their collective leverage in negotiations with big tech.  Rep. David Cicilline, top Democrat on the House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee, is expected to introduce a bill to do that next week. The Journalism Competition and Preservation Act of 2018 is a low-regulation, pro-market way to unleash the news industry\u2019s negotiating power. If antitrust enforcers can\u2019t protect society from the outsize influence of modern-day trusts, the least the government can do is get out of the way and let publishers protect themselves and their readers.

Photo: baz ratner/Reuters  Google is following Facebook \u2019s FB 0.40% lead by banning ads for cryptocurrencies and other \u201cspeculative financial products\u201d across its advertising platforms.  Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google said the new policy will become effective in June across ads bought on its search and display-advertising network, as well as its YouTube unit. The policy also will restrict ads for nontraditional methods of wagering on the future movements of stock prices and foreign-exchange, such as binary options and financial spread-betting, Google said.  Facebook updated its ad policy to ban ads for similar financial products on Jan. 30.  The rise in popularity and price of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies has led to scammers using online ads to promote fraudulent cryptocurrency schemes via online ads. One new tool in the scammer\u2019s arsenal is so-called crypto-jacking, or putting lines of code in websites or ads to surreptitiously harness the computing power of the web surfers who look at them. The power is used to mine cryptocurrency, a digital form of money that has no government or central-bank printing it or standing behind it. Google said last year it removed more than 130 million ads that were used by hackers to mine for cryptocurrency. That is a very small percentage of the ads run on Google\u2019s ad network. The company\u2019s director of sustainable ads, Scott Spencer, declined to comment on how much potential ad revenue the company would be turning away by enacting the new policy, saying the decision was made to prevent consumer harm. The company has long banned ads promoting counterfeit goods or dangerous products, such as weapons or recreational drugs. Financial regulators are taking a close look at the multibillion-dollar U.S. market for raising funds in cryptocurrencies, raising questions about how these assets may be regulated in the future. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission warned earlier this month that cryptocurrency exchanges risk being deemed illegal because they don\u2019t disclose how they determine what currencies can be bought and sold on their sites. In addition to its cryptocurrency ad-policy announcement, Google said in a blog post published Wednesday that it took down more than 3.2 billion ads that violated its wider policies in 2017, such as those that attempted to send people to sites loaded with malware or phishing scams. The company said it removed 1.7 billion bad ads in 2016. Some bad ads did get through its defenses\u2014which comprise a combination of technology and thousands of human content reviewers\u2014but Mr. Spencer said those that slipped through the net can be measured in the hundreds, as opposed to the billions. Overall, Google said it removed 320,000 publishers from its ad network for violating its various publisher policies in 2017, while about 90,000 websites and 700,000 mobile apps were blacklisted.

Google executives were among the most influential voices on its committees and helped steer its decision making to favor its own ad formats, the people said.  Google began conducting research on what types of ads consumers found most annoying in 2015. The following year, Google executive Scott Spencer met with advertising and publishing executives to gather support for a new initiative that would essentially curb the role played by ad blockers, according to people who were present.  In the meetings, Mr. Spencer proposed blacklisting certain types of ads, the people said. The ad standards could be voluntarily adopted by industry groups, or even enforced by browsers or ad-blocking software, he said. Executives were asked to sign nondisclosure agreements barring them from discussing the meetings.  Venable LLC, a Washington-based law firm, was hired by three ad trade groups including Interactive Advertising Bureau to set up and manage the coalition, said the firm\u2019s chairman Stuart Ingis.  Soon after the coalition was established, it voted to adopt Google\u2019s research, Mr. Ingis said. Google had surveyed consumers on dozens of ad formats and ranked them by how \u201cannoying\u201d they found each one. Long, skinny rectangles on the side of the screen were found the least annoying; full-screen messages with countdown timers were among the most annoying.  The coalition worked with Google to improve the research, including deciding on a number of additional ad formats to test, said one person involved in the process. Google tested 55 desktop ad formats and 49 mobile formats and presented the findings to the group.  The coalition ultimately deemed 12 ad formats unacceptable.  Google\u2019s leading role in the standard-setting process troubled some of the coalition\u2019s members, who observed that the blacklisted ad formats generally don\u2019t apply to Google\u2019s own business, according to people who were part of the process. Google generates most of its revenue from text search ads and rectangular display ads, rather than the visually rich media ads that will be banned by the coalition.  \u201cThey are creating a standard that doesn\u2019t apply to them,\u201d said Ryan McConville, president of mobile-ad startup Kargo, one of 17 members on the coalition\u2019s board.  Some of the members lobbied the coalition to make exceptions, including Facebook, which argued that the social network should be excluded from a rule banning videos that automatically play with sound. Bounce Exchange Inc., a pop-up ad maker, argued the pop-up ad rule should be changed to exclude ads that appear when a user is idle for more than 30 seconds. Both efforts were successful.  Google didn\u2019t test one of its own most prominent ad formats, the ads that run on YouTube videos for several seconds before users can skip them.  The Google spokeswoman said the coalition plans to test video ads in the future. Some of Google\u2019s own ads are likely to be blocked by Chrome since non-compliant sites will have all ads blocked, she added.  Mr. Spencer said Google has given ample warning to the affected publishers. He said that less than 1% of the web\u2019s most visited sites\u2014under 1,000 of them\u2014are currently out of compliance with the rules.  \u200bGoogle handles 90% of the world's internet searches, and it increasingly is promoting a single answer for many questions. Even subjective or unanswerable queries sometimes get seemingly definitive answers. Here's how the algorithms are -- and aren't -- working.

We\u2019re back after taking a short break over the Easter weekend. The Villanova Wildcats stormed to victory against the Michigan Wolverines to win their second college basketball championship in three seasons Monday night. TBS\u2019s ad sales team was probably celebrating, too. The average cost for a 30-second spot during the game ranged between $1.4 million and $1.7 million, a 3% jump over last year, according to media-research firm SQAD.  Plenty of popcorn-grabbing moments over the past few days as our tech overlords took potshots at each other. Apple CEO Tim Cook threw some barbs in Facebook\u2019s direction last week during a taping of an MSNBC interview with Recode\u2019s Kara Swisher slated to air April 6. Mr. Cook called for more privacy regulation and said he\u2019d never be in the same situation Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is currently in because Apple\u2019s business model relies on the sale of devices and services users, rather than essentially selling users to advertisers. Mr. Zuckerberg fired back in a must-read interview with Vox\u2019s Ezra Klein, saying Mr Cook\u2019s comments were \u201cextremely glib and not at all aligned with the truth.\u201d The killer quote: \u201cIt\u2019s important that we don\u2019t all get Stockholm syndrome and let the companies that work hard to charge you more convince you that they actually care more about you.\u201d Sharing\u2019s caring!  \u2014Chickity Check Yo Self Before You Wreck Yo Self\u2014  You\u2019ll remember Facebook last week said it was curbing the information it exchanges with data brokers and shutting down its \u201cPartner Categories\u201d ad targeting tool. Now changes are coming to Custom Audiences, where marketers upload their own customer data lists in order to target them with ads across Facebook\u2019s platform. TechCrunch reported Facebook is building a more prominent permission tool for advertisers to certify they have permission to use the data they\u2019re uploading and that it\u2019ll prevent the sharing of Custom Audiences data between different Business Manager accounts. Facebook\u2019s policies always stated that advertisers should have consent for the data they\u2019re uploading, but by making those terms more obvious it\u2019s hoping to prevent the kind of illicit data sharing we saw in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. And, like everyone else, Facebook\u2019s also preparing for the EU\u2019s new General Data Protection Regulation that goes into effect in May. Meanwhile, in a similar vein, Facebook-owned Instagram has suddenly limited how much data some developers can collect from its API, Recode reported.  The Magic Number  Google-owner Alphabet reports its quarterly earnings on April 23, but this time it\u2019s different, Bloomberg reports. Google has long tracked the amount of money it makes from ads using \u201ccost-per-click,\u201d a metric that\u2019s closely watched by analysts. That makes a lot more sense on search than on the network of third-party sites it sells ads across because most advertisers tend to buy display and video ads based on impressions rather than clicks. So, in Q1, Alphabet will report on percentage changes in impressions and cost-per-impressions metrics for its Network business. Speaking of impressions, YouTube is launching a new \u201cTrueView\u201d ad product that advertisers will pay for on an impression (CPM) basis, even if users skip at the five-second mark, Ad Age reports. What\u2019s the sell here? The blog post announcing \u201cTrueView for Reach\u201d suggests that brands that are good at getting their message across in just a few seconds can potentially reach more people and drive down their CPMs.  Laura, Can\u2019t You Give Me Some Time  Fox News has responded to advertisers\u2019 withdrawals from \u201cThe Ingraham Angle\u201d over a tweet by the show\u2019s host, Laura Ingraham, that mocked Parkland shooting survivor David Hogg. Ms. Ingraham, who apologized, is now off on a scheduled vacation and due to return next Monday, according to Fox News Co-President Jack Abernethy. Mr. Abernethy said in a statement, \u201cWe cannot allow voices to be censored by agenda-driven intimidation efforts,\u201d reports the Los Angeles Times. As the Wrap reported, \u201cThe Ingraham Angle\u201d had just 7 minutes of paid commercial time on Friday, down from an average of 14 minutes 33 seconds between January 1 and March 28, according to data from Kantar Media. The show lost five of its top 20 advertisers: Bayer, Hulu, Johnson & Johnson, Liberty Mutual and Wayfair. What\u2019s not clear is whether the network is taking a financial hit or whether advertisers have simply shifted to other Fox News shows. A source told Variety that Fox News is accommodating sponsors who want to move their ads elsewhere in the schedule. (Reminder: Fox News parent 21st Century Fox and Wall Street Journal parent News Corp share common ownership.)  Sumnertime Blues  CBS and Viacom are advancing in their merger talks. So who will have the final say on whether to do a deal? Sumner Redstone, the 94-year-old mogul whose health has declined so badly that he can\u2019t speak much beyond grunts, is still the most powerful figure, in theory \u2014 with an 80% voting interest in National Amusements, the holding company that itself owns nearly 80% voting stakes in Viacom and CBS. But WSJ\u2019s Keach Hagey has new details on the current chain of command: National Amusements updated its bylaws in 2016 to make clear that Mr. Redstone had a single vote among seven NAI directors in decisions tied to the Viacom and CBS stakes. That move, meant to clarify procedures partly due to questions about Mr. Redstone\u2019s mental capacity, hasn\u2019t previously been disclosed. Mr. Redstone\u2019s holding still gives him the power to replace NAI board members. A decision on whether to combine Viacom and CBS could come as soon as this month. And as Reuters first reported, CBS is close to making an all-stock offer that values Viacom below its current stock price.  Best of the rest  21st Century Fox said Tuesday it could sell British TV channel Sky News to Disney in order to ease the passage of its bid to acquire the 61% of Sky it does not already own. Its other proposed remedy is to establish Sky News as a separate company within the bigger Sky group, with an independent board and a 15-year funding guarantee.

The monopolies of old and of today were built on proprietary technology and physical networks that drove down costs while locking in customers, erecting formidable barriers to entry. Just as Standard Oil and AT&T were once critical to the nation\u2019s economic infrastructure, today\u2019s tech giants are gatekeepers to the internet economy. If they\u2019re imposing a cost, it may not be what customers pay but the products they never see.  In its youth Standard Oil was as revered for its technological and commercial brilliance as any big tech company today. John D. Rockefeller began with a single refinery in Cleveland in 1863 and over the next few decades acquired other, weaker refineries. Those that wouldn\u2019t sell, he underpriced and drove out of business. By 1904, companies controlled by Standard Oil produced 87% of refined oil output, according to Mike Scherer, a retired Harvard economist who has written extensively on antitrust.  This wasn\u2019t superficially bad for consumers. The price of kerosene, the principal refined product from oil, fell steadily as Standard Oil\u2019s market share expanded, thanks to falling crude oil prices and Standard Oil\u2019s economies of scale, bargaining power with suppliers such as railroads, and innovation, such as the Frasch-Burton process for deriving kerosene from high-sulfur oil in Ohio.  Standard Oil's refinery in Richmond, Calif., in 1911. Photo: Library of Congress/Corbis/VCG/Getty Images  When the federal government sued to break up Standard Oil, the Supreme Court acknowledged business acumen was important to the company\u2019s early success, but concluded that was eventually supplanted by a single-minded determination to drive others out of the market.  In a 2005 paper, Mr. Scherer found that Standard Oil was indeed a prolific generator of patents in its early years, but that slowed once it achieved dominance. Around 1909 Standard\u2019s Indiana unit invented \u201cthermal cracking\u201d to improve gasoline refining to meet nascent demand from automobiles, but the company\u2019s head office thought the technology too dangerous and refused to commercialize it. After the Indiana unit was spun off when the company was broken up in 1911, it commercialized the technology to enormous success, Mr. Scherer wrote.  Big Spenders Top tech companies owe their market position in part to heavy investment in new products and technology. R&D spending as a share of revenue Intel 21.5% Facebook 21.2% Alphabet  15.5%  Microsoft  13.8%  Johnson & Johnson  12.5%  Amazon*  11.8%  Apple  5.1%  General Motors  4.9%  General Electric  4.0%  Procter & Gamble  2.9%  AT&T  1.0%  Exxon Mobil  0.5%  The story of AT&T is similar. It owed its early growth and dominant market position to Alexander Graham Bell\u2019s 1876 patent for the telephone. After the related patents expired in the 1890s, new exchanges sprung up in countless cities to compete.  Competition was a powerful prod to innovation: Independent companies, by installing twisted copper lines and automatic switching, forced AT&T to do the same. But AT&T, like today\u2019s tech giants, had \u201cnetwork effects\u201d on its side.  \u201cJust like people joined Facebook because everyone else was on Facebook, the biggest competitive advantage AT&T had was that it was interconnected,\u201d says Milton Mueller, a professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology who has studied the history of technology policy.  Early in the 20th century, AT&T began buying up local competitors and refusing to connect independent exchanges to its long-distance lines, arousing antitrust complaints. By the 1920s, it was allowed to become a monopoly in exchange for universal service in the communities it served. By 1939, the company carried more than 90% of calls.  Though AT&T\u2019s research unit, Bell Labs, became synonymous with groundbreaking discoveries, in telephone innovation AT&T was a laggard. To protect its own lucrative equipment business it prohibited innovative devices such as the Hush-a-Phone, which kept others from overhearing calls, and the Carterphone, which patched calls over radio airwaves, from connecting to its network.  After AT&T was broken up into separate local and long-distance companies in 1982, telecommunication innovation blossomed, spreading to digital switching, fiber optics, cellphones\u2014and the internet.  Just as AT&T decided what equipment could be used on the nation\u2019s telephone systems, Google\u2019s search algorithms determine who can be found on the internet. If you searched for a toaster online in the mid 2000s, Google would probably have taken you to comparison shopping sites such as Nextag. They pioneered features such as showing consumer ratings in search results, how popular a product was and how prices had changed over time, recalls Gary Reback, an antitrust lawyer who represented several competitors against Google.  Google\u2019s Eric Schmidt testifying at a Senate Judiciary Committee antitrust hearing in September 2011. Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images  But when Google launched its own comparison business, Google Shopping, those sites found themselves dropping deeper into Google\u2019s search results. They accused Google of changing its algorithm to favor its own results. The company responded that its algorithm was designed to give customers the results they want. \u201cIf consumers don\u2019t like the answer that Google Search provides, they can switch to another search engine with just one click,\u201d Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt told Congress in 2011.  At that same hearing Jeffrey Katz, then the chief executive of Nextag, responded, \u201cThat is like saying move to Panama if you don\u2019t like the tax rate in America. It\u2019s a fake choice because no one has Google\u2019s scope or capabilities and consumers won\u2019t, don\u2019t, and in fact can\u2019t jump.\u201d  In 2013 the U.S. Federal Trade Commission concluded that even if Google had hurt competitors, it was to serve consumers better, and declined to bring a case. Since then, comparison sites such as Nextag have largely faded.  Last year the European Commission went in the other direction and fined the company $2.9 billion and ordered it to change its search results.  The different outcomes hinge in part on different approaches. European regulators are more likely to see a shrinking pool of competitors as inherently bad for both competition and consumers. American regulators are more open to the possibility that it could be natural and benign.  In new industries, smaller players are frequently bought up or vanquished by deeper-pocketed, more-innovative rivals. Google\u2019s general counsel, Kent Walker, wrote in response to the European Commission decision that even as smaller sites have retreated, Amazon has grown to become a huge player in comparison shopping.  Internet platforms have high fixed and minimal operating costs, which favors consolidation into a few deep-pocketed competitors. And the more customers a platform has, the more useful it is to each individual customer\u2014the \u201cnetwork effect.\u201d  But a platform that confers monopoly in one market can be leveraged to dominate another. Facebook\u2019s existing user base enabled it to become the world\u2019s largest photo-sharing site through its purchase of Instagram in 2012 and the largest instant-messaging provider through its purchase of WhatsApp in 2014. It is also muscling into virtual reality through its acquisition of Oculus VR in 2014 and anonymous polling with its purchase of TBH last year.  Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg speaks at a developers conference last year in San Jose, Calif. Photo: Stephen Lam/REUTERS  What Facebook doesn\u2019t acquire, it copies. Snap Inc.\u2019s Snapchat, a fast-disappearing photo and video sharing app hugely popular with teenagers, was widely seen as a challenger to Facebook. But in 2016, Facebook introduced its own Snapchat-like feature, Stories, on Instagram, which now has more users and advertisers than Snapchat. That has undercut Snap\u2019s growth and profits by reducing the number of new users \u201cinterested in trying Snap for the first time,\u201d says Peter Stabler, an analyst at Wells Fargo.  There\u2019s nothing wrong with copying, especially if the copy is better than the original. Snapchat\u2019s app was originally difficult to use, says Mr. Stabler, and \u201cyou can\u2019t discount [Facebook\u2019s] quality of execution.\u201d Moreover, even as Facebook copies its competitors, it continues to expand and enhance its own services such as Pages, which 70 million businesses world-wide have used to design their own webpages on Facebook.  Snap\u2019s shares have sunk below the price at which the company went public last March as losses have mounted, which won\u2019t encourage new entrants. Once a company like Google or Facebook has critical mass, \u201cthe venture capital looks elsewhere,\u201d says Roger McNamee of Elevation Partners, a technology-focused private-equity firm. \u201cThere\u2019s no point taking on someone with a three or four years head start.\u201d  Amazon hasn\u2019t yet reached the same market share as Google or Facebook but its position is arguably even more impregnable because it enjoys both physical and technological barriers to entry. Its roughly 75 fulfillment centers and state-of-the art logistics (including robots) put it closer, in time and space, to customers than any other online retailer.  The company says size makes it possible to deliver millions of items free of shipping charges to isolated communities with little retail presence. Amazon makes that network available to third-party merchants who pay a 15% commission and, typically, a $3 pick-pack-and ship-fee, says Greg Mercer, founder of Jungle Scout Inc. which advises third-party merchants how to sell on Amazon. \u201cWe have tons of examples of small entrepreneurial-type people who are really good at creating new inventions but have no idea how to distribute to the masses,\u201d he says. \u201cThey create products and Amazon can take care of the rest.\u201d  An Amazon warehouse in Britain. Photo: Jane Barlow/PA Images/Getty Images  As the dominant platform for third-party online sales, Amazon also has access to data it can use to decide what products to sell itself. In 2016 Capitol Forum, a news service that investigates anticompetitive behavior, reported that when a shopper views an Amazon private-label clothing brand, the accompanying list of items labeled \u201cCustomers Who Bought This Item Also Bought,\u201d is also dominated by Amazon\u2019s private-label brands. This, it says, restricts competing sellers\u2019 access to a prime marketing space  Mr. Mercer says he doesn\u2019t see Amazon favoring its own products, and indeed his own firm helps merchants target profitable niches on Amazon. Nonetheless, he says many would prefer to sell through their own sites, but with so many shoppers searching first on Amazon, they feel they have little choice.  In the face of such accusations, the probability of regulatory action\u2014for now\u2014looks low, largely because U.S. regulators have a relatively high bar to clear: Do consumers suffer?  \u201cWe think consumer welfare is the right standard,\u201d Bruce Hoffman, the FTC\u2019s acting director of the bureau of competition, recently told a panel on antitrust law and innovation. \u201cWe have tried other standards. They were dismal failures.\u201d  Still, Ms. Scott Morton notes, \u201cthe consumer welfare standard covers today and tomorrow,\u201d and the potential loss of innovation is something both the law and the courts can and have weighed in an antitrust case. The Justice Department sued Microsoft to ensure that an innovation, the internet browser, remained a potential competitor to Microsoft\u2019s monopoly over the user\u2019s interface with the personal computer.  Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates appeared at an antitrust hearing in Washington federal court in 2002. Photo: STEPHEN JAFFE/AFP/Getty Images  What would remedies look like? Since Big Tech owes its network effects to data, one often-proposed fix is to give users ownership of their own data: the \u201csocial graph\u201d of connections on Facebook, or their search history on Google and Amazon. They could then take it to a competitor.  A more drastic remedy would be to block acquisitions of companies that might one day be a competing platform. British regulators let Facebook buy Instagram in part because Instagram didn\u2019t sell ads, which they argued made them different businesses. In fact, Facebook used Instagram to engage users longer and thus sell more ads, Ben Thompson, wrote in his technology newsletter Stratechery. Building a network is \u201cextremely difficult, but, once built, nearly impregnable. The only possible antidote is another network that draws away the one scarce resource: attention.\u201d Thus, maintaining competition on the internet requires keeping \u201csocial networks in separate competitive companies.\u201d  How sound are these premises? Google\u2019s and Facebook\u2019s access to that data and network effects might seem like an impregnable barrier, but the same appeared to be true of America Online\u2019s membership, Yahoo \u2019s search engine and Apple\u2019s iTunes store, note two economists, David Evans and Richard Schmalensee, in a recent paper. All saw their dominance recede in the face of disruptive competition. If someone launched a clearly superior search engine, social network or online store, consumers could switch more easily than they could telephone or oil companies a century ago. Microsoft has long dominated desktop operating systems but has failed to extend that dominance to internet search or to mobile operating systems.  It\u2019s possible Microsoft might have become the dominant company in search and mobile without the scrutiny the federal antitrust case brought. Throughout history, entrepreneurs have often needed the government\u2019s help to dislodge a monopolist\u2014and may one day need it again.

Google has made a deal with Tencent that could help expand its small footprint in China. Photo: mike blake/Reuters  Alphabet Inc.\u2019s GOOGL -0.12% Google and Tencent Holdings Ltd. TCEHY -3.15% will license each other\u2019s technology patents, a deal that could help the former broaden its toehold in the Chinese market and accelerate the global expansion of the latter.  They entered a long-term patent cross-licensing agreement for a broad range of products and technologies, the two companies said Friday, adding they were open to more cooperation in the future.  \u201cBy working together on agreements such as this, tech companies can focus on building better products and services for their users,\u201d Mike Lee, Google\u2019s head of patents, said in a statement.  Financial terms weren\u2019t disclosed, and neither company commented beyond their statements.  Cross-licensing deals allow companies to license each other\u2019s technology for use in different markets, said Lester Ross, an attorney at WilmerHale in Beijing. Mr. Ross said that cross-licensing deals can restrain competition, but that they also create market efficiencies\u2014for example, reducing the cost of having to file for patents in multiple countries.  Companies such as Samsung Electronics Co. and Apple Inc. have signed such agreements in the past to prevent infringing each other\u2019s technology and regional patents and therefore avoiding expensive lawsuits.  The arrangement is the latest in a string of moves by Google to expand its reach into mainland China, after it pulled out its main search business in 2010 due to concerns about hacking and censorship. Several weeks ago, the Mountain View, Calif.-based company opened an artificial-intelligence lab in Beijing, and this week said it is opening a new Chinese office\u2014in Shenzhen, the city near Hong Kong, where Tencent is based.  Google already operates offices in Beijing and Shanghai, employing about 600 staff. Although Google\u2019s search engine is blocked in China, the offices are used mostly for its ad sales staff and engineers working on its global products. Google will use the new base in Shenzhen in part to tap into the region\u2019s electronics hardware supply chain, according to an email sent to its Chinese employees.  Tencent is China\u2019s largest tech company by market capitalization, and it makes most of its money from videogames. Its WeChat social network app is dominant in China, but has scant reach beyond.  Chris DeAngelis, China general manager for technology consultancy Alliance Development Group, sees the tie-up with Google as a sign of Tencent\u2019s global ambitions.  \u201cIt represents that China\u2019s technology giants have grown up,\u201d Mr. DeAngelis said. \u201cTencent is now a global player.\u201d  Write to Liza Lin at liza.lin@wsj.com and Alyssa Abkowitz at alyssa.abkowitz@wsj.com", "stock": "GOOGL"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/macron-woos-big-names-like-facebook-and-google-for-investment-1516639161", "label": 1, "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "date": "2018-01-22", "article": "French President Emmanuel Macron attends a hearing to mark the beginning of the year in Paris on Monday.  French President Emmanuel Macron attends a hearing to mark the beginning of the year in Paris on Monday. Photo: LUDOVIC MARIN, PRESS POOL  VERSAILLES, France\u2014French president Emmanuel Macron wined and dined Davos-bound business leaders inside the Palace of Versailles on Monday in an effort to shake off the country\u2019s image as a guillotine for foreign investment.  Some 140 executives, including Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai, met with Mr. Macron at the sprawling palace just outside Paris before traveling on to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.  The event, dubbed \u201cChoose France\u201d by Mr. Macron, is an attempt to persuade business leaders that France has finally changed its ways. Long criticized as a land of excessive red-tape and government meddling in the private sector, France is striking a different pose under Mr. Macron.  The investment banker-turned-president has adopted myriad pro-business measures during his first eight months in office, from looser labor laws to tax cuts. Now he is under pressure to show these changes can spur investment.  So far the results are mixed. While the French economy is growing again and economists expect unemployment to fall in the coming months, the latest figures showed the jobless rate rose to 9.7% at the end of the third quarter of 2017 from 9.5% in the second.  Mr. Macron used the Versailles meeting to announce a handful of investment projects officials said are \u201csignificant or emblematic\u201d for France\u2019s economic future, in areas from auto manufacturing to technology.  Facebook pledged Monday to double the size of its artificial intelligence lab in France to 60 researchers. Google said it would open an artificial intelligence research center in France and confirmed plans to increase staff at its Paris office to just over 1,000 from 700. Toyota said it would invest \u20ac300 million (about $367.3 million) at a site in the north of France, creating 700 permanent jobs.  Prior to the summit, Mr. Macron told businesses leaders they would only be invited to Versailles if they came promising a new investment project.  \u201cIt\u2019s not about asking for advice on such and such measure. We\u2019re saying: come and invest in France and create jobs,\u201d a French official said ahead of the visit.  Surveys show Mr. Macron has reasons to be optimistic. An annual poll by Ipsos of 200 France-based executives at international firms showed in November that 60% consider the country an attractive place to do business compared to 36% a year earlier. According to the same poll, 62% say the government is overhauling the economy at the right pace compared to 2% in the fall of 2016.  \u201cThe proof is here that France has once again become attractive for the biggest foreign investors,\u201d said Economy and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire.  France\u2019s changing image, however, will take time to show in quantitative measures of investment and hiring as companies need to adjust to new labor laws and changes to tax, business leaders say. The French government is also worried the U.S. tax overhaul could make it less attractive for U.S. firms to invest in Europe.  Business leaders held short meetings with Mr. Macron\u2019s cabinet in the afternoon in a format officials describe as \u201cspeed dating.\u201d Before hosting a dinner with all the delegates, Mr. Macron had 20-minute one-on-one meetings with Ms. Sandberg, Mr. Pichai, Novartis Chief Executive Vasant Narisimhan and SAP SE Chief Executive Bill McDermott.

Under the deal, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL -0.12% entered a contract to buy the Chelsea Market building at 75 Ninth Ave. from Jamestown LP, according to a person familiar with the transaction.  The potential acquisition comes as Amazon.com Inc., narrows its search for a second headquarters, and underscores the large impact the two companies can have on cities, raising real-estate values and adding high-paying jobs. The Alphabet deal also highlights New York City\u2019s ascendance in the past decade as one of the country\u2019s leading technology hubs.  Amazon has named New York City among the 20 finalists to host a second headquarters.  Technology companies have been increasing their share of office space in the Manhattan market over the past several years, with household names such as Amazon, Facebook Inc., Spotify USA and others signing large lease deals.  In the San Francisco Bay Area, tech companies have been gobbling up more space than they need in the short term to ensure they have enough capacity for workers and equipment down the line.

In addition, it has leased more than 200,000 square feet at Pier 57, a former freight terminal.

The unexpected compensation arrangement - announced in the middle of the night in California - involves no salary or cash bonus but sets up rewards for Musk multiplying Tesla\u2019s market value as much as ten-fold to $650 billion over the next 10 years.  That ambitious target implies Tesla stock will grow by 1,000 percent over a decade, or about 27 percent per year, a feat achieved by only a handful of major U.S. companies recently, including Amazon.com Inc, Priceline Group Inc and Domino\u2019s Pizza Inc. Netflix has surged 6,600 percent in the past 10 years.  Tesla\u2019s current market value of $60 billion is about the same as General Motors Co, but far below Apple Inc\u2019s $921 billion.  The plan comes after Tesla\u2019s much-anticipated Model 3 sedan missed several production targets and as many on Wall Street expect the company to launch another round of capital raising.  \u201cWe see Elon Musk\u2019s ambitious long-term awards plan as an aspirational marketing tool to attract talent and capital ahead of an upward inflection in competition\u201d for electric and autonomous vehicles, said Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, who has been bullish on Tesla shares.  Musk could earn more than $70 billion in incremental compensation through the deal, Jonas estimated. Tesla itself put Musk\u2019s maximum gain at $55.8 billion.  With the new plan, Tesla effectively quietened speculation that Musk may be planning to quit as the targets require him to remain as chief executive or serve as both executive chairman and chief product officer.  Tesla noted, however, that the deal provides \u201cthe flexibility to bring in another CEO who would report to Elon at some point in the future.\u201d The company added that there was no current intention for this to happen.  Some investors worry that Musk\u2019s ambition to build Tesla into a behemoth will severely stretch its production capabilities, aggravating production delays and stretching Tesla\u2019s high cash burn rate.  Meanwhile, a host of global automakers from Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) to Ford Motor Co plan to introduce new electric vehicles into the marketplace in coming years, posing a major threat.  Tesla\u2019s shares, which gained 46 percent last year, closed 0.3 percent higher at $352.79.

The company\u2019s market value must increase to $100 billion for the first tranche to vest and must continue to increase in additional $50 billion increments for the remaining 11 tranches.  Musk, also Tesla\u2019s chairman, was an early investor in the company and is now its biggest shareholder, owning about a fifth of all shares outstanding.  He has founded several companies, including rocket maker SpaceX and The Boring Company - leading some to speculate that his interest in leading Tesla could eventually wane. His net worth is about $20 billion, according to Forbes.  Musk has vowed that Tesla will become \u201cthe best manufacturer on Earth,\u201d helped by a new, highly automated assembly line and a simpler design for its Model 3 sedan. However, production woes have slowed deliveries.  While Tesla\u2019s luxury Model S sedans and Model X SUVs have earned it a legion of fans for its technical innovations and respect from the automotive industry, it is the more mass-market Model 3 sedan that is key to the company\u2019s long-term viability.  The company said on Tuesday it must meet a set of escalating revenue and adjusted EBITDA targets for Musk to earn compensation tied to the operational milestones.  For each tranche, Musk will vest in stock options that correspond to about 1.69 million shares, or 1 percent of Tesla\u2019s current total outstanding shares.  The performance award was created by the company\u2019s board in consultation with third party compensation consultant Compensia Inc. It requires the approval of Tesla\u2019s shareholders.

Tesla requires users to agree to keep their hands on the wheel at all times before they can use Autopilot. Users, however, routinely brag they can use the system to drive hands-free.  Tesla said a week after the accident that vehicle logs showed no action had been taken by the driver right before the crash and that he had received earlier warnings to put his hands on the wheel.  The driver, who was 38, died at a nearby hospital shortly after the vehicle hit a concrete highway divider near Mountain View, in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Trump\u2019s order, signed into law on Tuesday, imposes a 30 percent tariff on fully assembled imported solar panels as well as the cells of which the panels are made - a move intended to protect American jobs but which the solar industry worries will raise costs and trigger thousands of layoffs.  But in a twist destined to help the California company, the solar cell tariff only kicks in after 2.5 gigawatts worth hit U.S. shores each year.  Tesla uses solar cells in its nascent solar roof tile business. The tiles generate electricity without the need for a traditional panel. Tesla also has plans to build conventional panels using imported cells for its U.S.-based residential installation business, which it also hopes to grow over the coming years.  Tesla said on Tuesday it expects to be able to import \u201csome or all of our non-U.S. cells for Solar Roof and solar panel modules free of tariffs.\u201d  Only 500 MW worth of solar cells were imported into the United States in total last year, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, a fifth of what is being exempted from Trump\u2019s tariff.  Baird analyst Ben Kallo agreed the tariff was generally positive for Tesla as it will make its domestic products more competitive with imports - though he noted its installation business will pay higher prices for imported panels in the short term. Tesla shares rose $1.23, or 0.3 percent, to close at $352.79 on Tuesday.  Tesla had been part of a group of domestic manufacturers that lobbied against tariffs on solar products.

Tesla.  Does Elon Musk control Tesla Inc.? Colloquially speaking, sure he does: He is Tesla's chief executive officer, the chairman of its board and its largest shareholder. He is also its co-founder, even though he didn't found it, which is a hard trick to pull off at a company that you don't control.  But there is also a narrower question, which is: Is Elon Musk the controlling shareholder of Tesla? That is less obvious. He owns about 22 percent of the stock, which is rather less than a majority, and it's all just normal stock, with no super-voting rights or anything. This narrower question matters because, under Delaware law (Tesla is a Delaware company), there are limits on what a controlling shareholder can do to enrich himself at the expense of a company that he controls. For instance, when Tesla acquired SolarCity Corp. in 2016, when Musk was SolarCity's chairman and largest shareholder (and his cousin was its CEO), and when SolarCity was financially troubled and needed to be bailed out by someone, that looked, to a lot of people, like kind of an awkward transaction.  But Delaware law does not have a category for \"kind of an awkward transaction.\" It has basically two relevant categories: If Musk was the controlling shareholder of Tesla, and caused Tesla to buy SolarCity, then a judge will review the transaction for \"entire fairness\" and, if he finds that the process or price was unfair, he can award damages for shareholders against Musk and the directors. But if Musk was not the controlling shareholder -- if he was just a CEO who happened to own some shares, and who was answerable to the board of directors and shareholders -- then the board's decision to buy SolarCity is subject to \"business judgment\" review, which basically means that the board can do whatever it wants. (Also even if he was the controlling shareholder, he could have avoided entire fairness review \"if at the outset of a self-dealing transaction the controlling stockholder effectively relinquished control over the outcome to an independent committee of disinterested directors and a nonwaivable, fully informed vote of a majority of the minority stockholders.\")  So is he the controlling shareholder? Yesterday a Delaware judge ruled on a motion to dismiss a shareholder lawsuit over the SolarCity deal and decided that it's a \"close call\" but that Musk might have controlled Tesla, so the lawsuit can go forward. The reasons for Musk's control are all the sort of obvious things: He owns a lot of shares, not a majority but enough to sway the vote; he dominates the board of directors and, in particular, dominated the board's discussion of the proposed SolarCity deal (bringing it to the board three times, and curiously never discussing the possibility of buying another solar company instead of SolarCity); he \"has demonstrated a willingness to facilitate the ouster of senior management when displeased\"; and he is central to the company's business, raising money for it and acting as its public face and authoring its \"Master Plan.\" (And while Tesla did require a majority of the non-Musk shareholders to approve the deal, and allowed independent directors to negotiate the price -- which I thought was rather good governance, considering -- Musk was fully involved in the board decisions about whether to do the deal.) You can't really object too much to that conclusion. Intuitively, Tesla is Musk's company, while also being a public company, and using a public company you control to bail out another public company that you also control seems like the sort of thing that controlling-shareholder rules are supposed to be suspicious of.  Still it's a little weird. Musk is the charismatic founder-CEO-visionary of Tesla, sure. But he owns 22 percent of the shares, with 22 percent of the vote. Plenty of other tech-company founder-CEO-visionaries have found much stronger ways to formalize their perpetual control. Mark Zuckerberg owns about 16 percent of the shares of Facebook Inc., but he controls almost 60 percent of the vote, and almost got the company to give him voting control forever even if he sells more of his stock. Evan Spiegel and Robert Murphy are the charismatic founder-visionaries of Snap Inc.; they own less than 40 percent of the stock between them, but control more than 88 percent of the vote. Meanwhile, just being a founder-CEO-visionary who dominates the board, has the ideas, and is the public face of the company is not necessarily enough to keep control, as Travis Kalanick can tell you. The voting power usually doesn't matter, when things are good for the founder-CEO-visionary, but when it matters it matters.  There seem to be two models of governance in large technology companies run by founder-visionaries: There is the founder-visionary-CEO as perpetual owner and controlling shareholder, who jealously guards his rights so that he can't be unseated by insurgent shareholders or directors, and there is the founder-visionary-CEO who actually does give shareholders a vote, and who relies on his charisma and vision to keep the shareholders and directors in line. Those models often come to more or less the same place, but they don't always; Musk has to wake up every day and persuade his shareholders and directors that his charismatic vision is the right one, in a way that Zuckerberg just doesn't. It's a little rough on Musk that he's not actually the controlling shareholder and the law treats him like he is anyway.  In other Tesla news, its bonds are cratering. \"You can see quickly that Tesla is singularly unsuited to using debt,\" wrote Aswath Damodaran back in August, when it was issuing debt. But \"bond investors pretty much ignored the carmaker\u2019s prolific cash burn and repeated failures to meet production targets and lent it $1.8 billion at record-low interest rates.\" I guess investors saw the unsuitability slowly: The bonds \"plunged to a low of 86 cents on the dollar\" yesterday, and Moody's Investors Service downgraded them to a Caa1 rating this week. I have to say that as I spend time this month reading financial-crisis anniversary pieces, I cannot get that worked up about a low-junk-rated money-losing company's bonds trading down to a 7.8 percent yield. As these things go, that's still pretty good.  A warning shot.  How are things at Deutsche Bank AG? Oh great, great, except that it has been widely reported that Chairman Paul Achleitner has grown tired of Chief Executive Officer John Cryan and is openly searching for his replacement. Yesterday Cryan sent out a staff memo saying that he is \"absolutely committed\" to staying, which is not quite the question that was being asked:  \u201cThe fact that Cryan must write his own defense and doesn\u2019t get any backing from Achleitner is a sign of weakness for the CEO,\u201d said Florian Sauerburger, a portfolio manager at Aramea Asset Management, which owns Deutsche Bank stock.  It's true. It rather seems like the intended audience for the memo was Achleitner and the board, and that its message was \"back off.\" \"We need to focus on executing on the strategy that was agreed and signed off by both the management and supervisory boards,\" wrote Cryan, who mentioned the \"destabilizing effect\" of \"widespread rumors\" and urged, \"Let\u2019s not allow ourselves to be thrown off course.\" They're all employee-appropriate sentiments, I guess, but also interpretable as an argument that the noisy search for his replacement should quiet down. Meanwhile there is this:  The person close to Mr Achleitner stressed that replacing Mr Cryan \u201cis not a foregone conclusion at this point\u201d, adding that the chief executive should take the debate as \u201ca warning shot\u201d and redouble efforts to cut costs.  Is that a thing? Is it normal for a board of directors to go around noisily auditioning replacements for their CEO in order to light a fire under the incumbent? It seems rather tough for the incumbent's authority, not to mention his morale. Anyway as long as Cryan is still around he is going to do what he does, which is make cuts at the investment bank, though there too Deutsche seems to be of two minds about everything:  As part of the investment bank review, cuts are being discussed at both big trading businesses -- equities as well as fixed income, currencies and commodities -- because they are expensive and haven\u2019t performed well, said one person. However, the extent of a potential retrenchment is unclear because many traders just got big bonuses in an effort to retain top performers, this person said.  I have to say that getting a big retention bonus and then immediately being laid off is ... not the worst way to go.  The crypto.  Here is a profile of Zhao Changpeng, the founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance, who spent \"several years developing trading systems for companies including Bloomberg L.P.,\" and who is now maybe a billionaire, but who has apparently never met a lawyer? Or something, I don't know, what do you make of this explanation for why Binance lists so many initial coin offerings that have characteristics of unregistered securities:  Zhao said the exchange\u2019s client identification policies are similar to those of some U.S.-based venues and that Binance takes a venture capital-like approach to evaluating the coins it lists, favoring those that are backed by teams with a track record and real products. He also asks issuers to provide Binance with a legal opinion that the coins aren\u2019t securities.  Look. The way venture capital works is that it invests in companies, specifically by buying securities of those companies. If you evaluate coins by examining their team and their products using a \"venture capital-like approach,\" that is because they are companies and they are issuing securities.  Also I have a feeling we should check in on this guy in six months:  \u201cThe less regulation, the better,\u201d said Zachary Ising, a 24-year-old graduate student at California University of Pennsylvania who relies on virtual currency trading for all his income and has a majority of his assets in a Binance account. \u201cI\u2019m confident in Binance\u2019s ability to secure its own platform.\u201d  Elsewhere: \"Russia says Venezuela has not offered to repay debts in cryptocurrency.\" And: \"Reddit Disables Bitcoin Payments.\" Honestly I didn't know that you could pay for Reddit, but if I had known that you could pay for Reddit, I'd have been pretty confident that you could pay for Reddit with Bitcoin. Now you can't.  Blockchain blockchain blockchain.  Here is \"Blockchain Technology for Corporate Governance and Shareholder Activism\" by Anne Lafarre and Christoph Van der Elst. \"Shares are usually held through complex chains of intermediaries,\" they write, and \"these intermediaries not only add transaction costs to shareholder participation per se, there is also high uncertainty that information, including the record of shareholder votes, is correctly channelled between ultimate shareholders and companies in remote participation.\" The solution is of course the blockchain:  In a private blockchain, managed by the company only accessible for shareholders for example on the Hyperledger of IBM, the company and shareholders that hold sufficient shares can place proposals. Smart contracting allows for the private ledger to be structured so that all relevant information including majority rules and access rights that are contained in the articles of association and the law are taken into account. Once a certain proposal is placed in the blockchain, shareholders that hold shares in the company are immediately notified and can exercise their voting rights during a short period. The voting results may become instantly available after a cut-off point, and majority requirements, necessary to render the decision binding and verifiable, need to be reached in a specified timeframe. Shareholders can verify their own transactions, but none of the shareholders should be able to determine what voting decision was taken by other shareholders.  Look, you know, fine. We have talked about exactly these problems -- the complex chain of intermediation in stock voting that leads to uncertainty and reduced participation -- and in fact I have even gone so far as to mutter the word \"blockchain\" in those discussions. But what if you replaced the word \"blockchain\" in the paragraph above with a word like, say, \"website\"? What if the company had a private website where it could put proposals, and a database where it tracked share ownership, and the shareholders could log in to the website and see and vote on proposals? The call here is for a private blockchain -- one administered by the company -- so the trustlessness and decentralization benefits of public blockchains are not relevant. This is just an argument that companies should have better databases for tracking their shareholders, and better user interfaces to allow those shareholders to vote their shares. The blockchain has nothing to do with it, except that people want to read about the blockchain.  Elsewhere, some of the people who piloted blockchain projects realized they were pointless:  DTCC, known as Wall Street\u2019s bookkeeper, recently put the brakes on a blockchain system for the clearing and settlement of repurchase, or repo, agreement transactions, said Murray Pozmanter, head of clearing agency services at the DTCC. The project, which had successfully tested with startup Digital Asset Holdings (DA), was shelved because banks and other potential users believed the same results could be achieved more cheaply using current technology, he said. \u201cBasically, it became a solution in search of a problem,\u201d he said.  Yes! The blockchain project worked! But also so would a database run by a trusted central counterparty such as, just to throw one name out there, DTCC. You could just about imagine someone, somewhere, saying \"the blockchain is a solution to the problem that we rely too much on DTCC to clear and settle repo trades.\" (I mean, it seems like a niche thing to worry about, but you could.) It is harder to imagine DTCC concluding that. And if DTCC is going to run a centralized blockchain, why not just run a centralized database instead?  Virtual reality.  Are we currently living in a computer simulation run for the entertainment or edification of some far more intelligent beings? Sure, why not. I have to say that the best evidence for it is that when people come up with virtual-reality projects, the reality always seems to be so grimly literal. Microsoft Corp., for instance, developed \"a digital room where we could sit at a digital desk and interact with Microsoft programs such as Word,\" which sounds a whole lot like the actual rooms at my house and my office where I sit at an actual desk and interact with Word. And if a virtual-reality desk job isn't quite existentially terrifying enough for you, now you can virtually die at your virtual-reality desk:  Visitors could don VR glasses and earphones to experience having a seizure at work, a failed paramedic rescue, and entrance into the afterlife. Funeral parlor employee Dong Ziyi told The Beijing News that the immersive experience \u201cenables people to better cherish the beauty of life.\u201d  Now we just need a virtual-reality experience of eating lunch at your desk. We really are building all the components of virtual-reality life, and death, under late capitalism. I would na\u00efvely have thought that people would build virtual reality experiences that are, you know, fun, that you can't really get in your daily life. As opposed to, like, \"do some word processing and then die at your desk.\" But I guess the fact that our simulated reality is so much like our boring reality is an argument that our boring reality is itself a simulation.

A string of executives have headed for the exits, including a surprising number from the company\u2019s finance team, as Tesla is dogged by questions about whether it can meet its production targets.  The chief financial officer left abruptly last year in a curious turn of events, where he was replaced by his predecessor: Deepak Ahuja served as Tesla\u2019s CFO from 2008 to 2015 and then took over the job again in March 2017, according to his LinkedIn. Then late last year, one of Tesla\u2019s audit committee members, Steve Jurvetson, went on leave from the board (following accusations of misconduct, which he has denied). The vice president of business development and director of battery technology both left in the past year. Jon McNeill, one of Tesla\u2019s most senior executives, went to take the chief operating officer job at Lyft Inc. last month. Eric Branderiz, Tesla\u2019s chief accounting officer, departed last week. And Bloomberg reported this week that Susan Repo, the corporate treasurer and vice president of finance, is out.  The press has rightly been focused on trying to figure out how badly Tesla will miss its production targets for the all-important Model 3 electric sedan. After all, actually building cars is pretty important to Tesla\u2019s business.  Bloomberg built a Tesla Model 3 Tracker. The data show Tesla is producing approximately 737 cars a week. In July, Tesla predicted that it would produce 5,000 Model 3s a week by the end of 2017. Oops.  Tesla has steadily rolled back its production targets and still looks like it will be behind schedule. According to Bloomberg\u2019s analysis, Tesla Model 3 output has actually slowed from February when it was producing something like 936 Model 3s a week. My colleague Dana Hull reported that Tesla temporarily suspended production in late February, potentially explaining the slowdown.  CNBC reported Wednesday that many of the vehicles coming off Tesla\u2019s assembly line required more work. One employee estimated that \u201c40 percent of the parts made or received at its Fremont factor require work,\u201d the article said. Some investors surely found Tesla\u2019s response to the article to be laughable. The company\u2019s statement reads, \u201cIn what world is the pursuit of perfection looked down on? Not one we want to live in.\u201d  Ah yes, a story about how Tesla is producing cars in an inefficient fashion is really about a company with high standards.  On Thursday, the Wall Street Journal declared it \u201cTesla\u2019s Make-Or-Break Moment.\u201d That article rightly points out that Tesla had $3.4 billion of cash at the end of 2017 and that last year it burned $1 billion a quarter. Do the math, and Tesla either needs to generate more revenue or raise more money soon.  The Journal\u2019s story observes that Tesla has a so-called Z-Score (a measure of a company\u2019s financial security) of 1.26. \u201cAny company with a score below 1.8 is considered distressed by many investors. A score of 1.0 or lower suggests bankruptcy is likely within two years,\u201d Tim Higgins and Susan Pulliam write.  The financial markets have given Tesla a long leash, but the evidence against the viability of its business continues to mount. About 23 percent of publicly traded Tesla stock is being used to bet against the automaker. That\u2019s a lot of short sellers.  Of course, Chanos has been warning against Tesla since at least October 2016. \u201cThe whole thing is just sort of this m\u00e9lange of publicly traded and privately traded science projects gone awry. So we\u2019ll see how it works out,\u201d he said at the time. Despite his years-long bets against the company, the stock has been climbing. The Tesla Hype Train keeps going.  But I have to end this piece with a necessary caveat. Despite cash flow concerns, Musk\u2019s companies have generally worked out for investors. Peter Thiel issued what has become a sort of Silicon Valley koan: \u201cNever bet against Elon.\u201d  This article also ran in Bloomberg Technology\u2019s Fully Charged newsletter. Sign up here.

Now chipmakers\u2019s former chairman is trying to raise money to buy Qualcomm, according to the Financial Times.  Silicon Valley\u2019s takeaway from Theranos: The SEC is watching you.

Model S sedan that rear-ended a firetruck on a freeway near Los Angeles on Monday, the agency said.  The safety agency has not yet decided whether it will open a formal investigation of the crash, NTSB spokesman Chris O\u2019Neil said in an email. The safety board only investigates a handful of highway accidents each year.  The Tesla\u2019s driver said he had the vehicle\u2019s Autopilot driver-assist system engaged when it struck a firetruck at around 65 miles per hour, a union for Culver City, California firefighters said in a tweet on Monday. \"Amazingly there were no injuries! Please stay alert while driving!\" the union said in the tweet.  The firetruck was parked in an emergency lane at the side of the highway attending to another accident at the time of the morning collision, according to the Mercury News.  Tesla said in a statement that Autopilot is \u201cintended for use only with a fully attentive driver.\u201d The company said it has taken steps to educate drivers about the need to keep their hands on the steering wheel and be prepared to take over from Autopilot, which it calls an \"advanced driver assistance system\" that is not intended to turn the vehicle into an autonomous car.  The NTSB has previously said Tesla\u2019s Autopilot system was a contributing factor in a 2016 fatal crash in Florida. In that incident, a Model S driver died after the car drove underneath a semi-trailer crossing a divided road that the Autopilot\u2019s sensors failed to detect.  The NTSB criticized Tesla and other carmakers for measuring whether a driver is paying attention using steering wheel movement in a September report about the fatal 2016 Tesla crash involving Autopilot.  General Motors Co. last year began equipping some Cadillac cars with its Super Cruise system that allows for going hands-free on the highway. The system monitors whether a driver is paying attention using a small camera on the top of the steering wheel column to track head position.  \u2014 With assistance by Dana Hull", "stock": "TSLA"}, {"url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-16/metal-tycoon-to-leapfrog-elon-musk-with-world-s-biggest-battery", "label": -1, "source": "bloomberg", "date": "2018-03-16", "article": "Sanjeev Gupta plans to snatch the world\u2019s biggest battery crown from Tesla Inc. founder Elon Musk.

Other rivals may also overtake Musk including a South Korean project.  GFG, which last year added steel operations to iron ore mines in Australia, said the battery will help power a 200 megawatt solar farm at its Whyalla steelworks. Simec Zen hopes its Big Battery Project will provide grid stability and act as a buffer to power outages, which have included a state-wide blackout in September 2016.  \u201cAs well as being the most powerful battery in the world, Simec Zen\u2019s storage facility will help underpin the long-term viability of the Whyalla steelworks as well as provide additional benefits to the South Australian grid,\u201d Weatherill said.

The unprecedented pay package has been criticized as too costly by proxy adviser Glass Lewis & Co., which has recommended that investors reject the plan. While it would likely have slim chances of getting passed elsewhere, Tesla isn\u2019t a typical company, and Musk isn\u2019t a conventional chief executive officer.  \u201cWe think what Tesla has achieved so far is pretty remarkable, but there\u2019s more they can do in not just automotive, but the energy markets,\u201d Tom Slater, a Baillie Gifford partner and fund manager, said Wednesday in a phone interview. \u201cElon Musk -- his drive and his vision -- has been a really important part of getting us to this point.

Each tranche equals about 1 percent of Tesla\u2019s outstanding shares. The company\u2019s market value has to reach $650 billion for the award to fully vest -- roughly a 12-fold increase.  Musk Dependence  Musk\u2019s star power has helped vault Tesla to an almost $55 billion market capitalization, exceeding the value of General Motors Co. or Ford Motor Co. While the company has struggled to mass-manufacture cars including the new Model 3 sedan, he\u2019s convinced investors to buy into his vision of consumers converting to electric vehicles in droves.  Tesla lists its dependence on Musk as a risk factor in securities filings, and some analysts and short sellers have raised concern that the carmaker could run into trouble because of the amount of attention he devotes to other ventures including rocket company Space Exploration Technologies Corp.  \u201cI expect to remain CEO for the foreseeable future,\u201d Musk said during Tesla\u2019s earnings call in February. \u201cThere are no plans to make a change at this time.\u201d  Tesla without Elon wouldn\u2019t be the same company, said Joel Grant, an automotive and industrial analyst at T.

The unprecedented pay package proposes Musk won\u2019t get paid unless his company\u2019s stock rises, further tying the 46-year-old chief executive officer\u2019s personal wealth to that of shareholders. It envisions a staggering increase in market value to $650 billion that would put Tesla in the league of tech giants like Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp., now more than 10 times its size. Revenue would expand to $175 billion, ahead of General Motors Co.  The move assures investors that Musk will lead Tesla through its next phase of rapid growth despite his many other commitments and interests. He is also the CEO of Space Exploration Technologies Corp. and has embarked on several other ventures including OpenAI, Neuralink and the Boring Co.  Under the plan, which requires shareholder approval in March, Musk\u2019s pay is tied strictly to stock performance and profit. He will receive no salary or bonus. A 10-year grant of stock options vests in 12 tranches that are linked to market capitalization in $50 billion increments, starting at $100 billion. There are also milestones tied to revenue and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, Tesla said in a statement.  Musk Payday 10-year pay plan means CEO could bag $56 billion -- theoretically Source: Tesla  Musk, who is already Tesla\u2019s biggest shareholder, has a net worth estimated at $21.5 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The new pay plan would add as much as $55.8 billion to that total. The company said that figure was theoretical, given the likelihood of additional employee stock awards, as well as the possibility of mergers or raising new capital.  \u201cWhile Tesla has no way of predicting how much dilution there will be, some amount of future dilution is a certainty,\u201d the company said in a filing.  The agreement requires Musk to remain as Tesla\u2019s CEO or serve as executive chairman and chief product officer -- potentially paving the way for the company to eventually hire another CEO. The plan is aimed at ensuring that Musk \u201cwill continue to lead Tesla\u2019s management over the long-term while also providing the flexibility to bring in another CEO who would report to Elon at some point in the future,\u201d the company said.  Tesla, based in Palo Alto, California, has more than 33,000 employees worldwide and recently launched the Model 3 sedan, a more affordable electric car that is the linchpin to the company\u2019s efforts to reach the mass market and profitability. Tesla, which has struggled to ramp up production of the car, no longer includes vehicle output targets in Musk\u2019s proposed compensation plan.  The company, whose stated mission \u201c is to accelerate the world\u2019s transition to sustainable energy,\u201d also sells its batteries to utilities seeking to integrate renewable forms of energy like solar and wind onto the grid. That product line is expanding to include a solar roof product for homeowners. Musk\u2019s personal brand as a futurist is deeply intertwined with the identity of the company, which has legions of fans and devoted customers but has yet to make an annual profit.  Musk\u2019s previous compensation plan was also tied to stock performance and vehicle development targets set in 2012. The carmaker was valued at $59.1 billion at the close of trading Monday. The shares have jumped 13 percent since the start of the year.

The problem is that a key to its future battery manufacturing is still in Germany.  The electric-car maker -- which still plans to make about 2,500 of the cars a week by the end of March -- designed a new automated system for module production at its battery factory near Reno, Nevada. The line is already working at Tesla\u2019s German manufacturing unit Grohmann but needs to be shipped to the U.S. next month to be put to use, Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said.  \u201cThat\u2019s got to be disassembled, brought over to the Gigafactory, and re-assembled and then brought into operation at the Gigafactory. It\u2019s not a question of whether it works or not. It\u2019s just a question of disassembly, transport and reassembly,\u201d he said on a conference call Wednesday. Once that milestone is completed, Tesla will next need to fix material-handling constraints at its Fremont, California, assembly plant before it can reach its goal to make 5,000 Model 3 sedans a week by the end of June.  Tesla has pushed back targets several times for Model 3, the more affordable car it\u2019s banking on to propel it from niche electric-car maker to more of a mass manufacturer. The slower production ramp has meant less money is coming in the door from customers taking delivery, and Wall Street is watching closely for any signs the targets could slip again.  Tesla shares fell 8.6 percent to $315.23 on Thursday in New York, the biggest one-day drop since June 2016.  Positive News  Other aspects of Tesla\u2019s latest quarterly loss were more positive. The company\u2019s cash balance barely budged in the last three months of the year even as it struggled to make Model 3 sedans.  Paying customers are supporting Tesla through its production struggle -- they\u2019ve put down more than $850 million in deposits for vehicles including the Semi truck and Roadster sports car Musk showed off in November.  \u201cThe business is complex, and there\u2019s almost always something for bears to focus on. But in Q4, we think most of the news was positive,\u201d Piper Jaffray analyst Alexander Potter wrote in a report.  While it\u2019s going to take time to get Model 3 production to targeted levels, the chief executive officer of both Tesla and Space Exploration Technologies Corp. has succeeded in captivating consumers in the meantime. Musk\u2019s latest promotional stunt involved firing off a sports car into the sky atop the world\u2019s most powerful rocket.  \u201cIf we can send a Roadster to the asteroid belt, we can probably solve Model 3 production,\u201d Musk said on the conference call with analysts, shortly after tweeting another photo of his Roadster hurtling through space.  Unconventional Fundraising Tesla's customer deposits jumped in fourth quarter amid Semi truck, Roadster reveals Source: Company statements  Tesla has said it\u2019s putting off spending to double its production rate to 10,000 Model 3s until it reaches the 5,000 unit milestone. It also deferred some Model 3-related capital expenditures in the fourth quarter, which \u201cdressed up the cash flow,\u201d Cowen\u2019s Osborne said.  A closely watched figure indicating how much money Tesla is using up -- negative free cash flow -- was just $277 million in the fourth quarter, the lowest in more than a year.  Easing Concerns  \u201cAll the cash concerns will be alleviated once they get these cars on the road,\u201d said Tasha Keeney, an analyst at ARK Investment Management, which holds Tesla stock.  Tesla is still far from being in the clear with regards to cash. The company finished the fourth quarter with about $3.4 billion, and it\u2019s planning slightly more than $3.4 billion in capital expenditures this year after spending that much in 2017.  Some of the expenditures planned for this year are linked to what\u2019s coming next to Tesla\u2019s lineup. In addition to the Semi going into production in 2019 and the Roadster coming in 2020, Tesla plans to add a crossover called the Model Y.  Tesla will announce the location for where it\u2019ll build that in three to six months, with capital spending toward the vehicle starting later this year.  The company expects to deliver about 100,000 Model S sedans and Model X sport utility vehicles, in line with last year\u2019s 101,312.  The department tasked with pulling that off will now be reporting directly to the CEO after Lyft Inc. hired away Jon McNeill, who had been president of global sales and service at Tesla and an influential figure at the company.

Elon Musk, in a testy Twitter exchange, said he is \u201cback to sleeping at the factory\u201d while trying to fix production delays with the Model 3 electric car. It\u2019s a move reminiscent of Tesla\u2019s last vehicle launch\u2014the Model X\u2014when Musk famously kept a sleeping bag near the production line so he could immediately address any hiccups.  \u201cCar biz is hell,\u201d Musk said.  The posts on Twitter came as investors await Tesla\u2019s first-quarter production numbers, which are expected to fall short of company forecasts. The exchange, with a reporter at the Information, a tech and business news site, followed a story by the outlet that Musk had taken over Model 3 production from Tesla\u2019s head of engineering, Doug Field.  For the past year, Field has managed engineering of both the vehicle and its production. Musk said Field had originally been tasked with both jobs to ensure Tesla doesn\u2019t design cars that are \u201ccrazy hard to build,\u201d but now that the company was back in the thick of production, \u201cit\u2019s better to divide and conquer.\u201d  Tesla Inc. is under enormous pressure to build the Model 3 fast enough to meet customer demand\u2014and to bring in revenue to offset billions of dollars spent preparing for its rollout. An experimental tracking model developed by Bloomberg estimates that Tesla was able to produce 9,285 Model 3s for the quarter and achieved a final burst of production of as many as 2,200 cars a week. Musk had vowed to reach 2,500 a week by the end of the first quarter\u2014a target that was already scaled back from a prior forecast of 5,000 a week by the end of 2017.  See more about the Bloomberg Model 3 Tracker here.  Tesla has built up a die-hard fan base, with some half a million people putting down $1,000 reservations for the Model 3 since it was unveiled two years ago. But the company is still trying to prove it has what it takes to be a true mass-production company. Tesla reports production and delivery results within a few days of each quarter ending.  When Tesla rolled out the Model X in late 2015, it was years behind schedule, and production was marred by problems with its complicated falcon wing doors, custom mono-post rear seats and other unique new high-tech features. Musk told investors in 2016 that he kept a sleeping bag on hand and moved his desk to wherever the factory problems were most troublesome.  It\u2019s not clear where Tesla\u2019s current bottlenecks reside. During a first-quarter earnings call, Musk said the primary holdup was with robots at the company\u2019s battery Gigafactory near Reno, Nevada. A new production line had been built for it at Tesla\u2019s Grohmann Automation labs in Germany and was scheduled to be installed at the Gigafactory last month. If Musk is instead camping out at the automaker\u2019s Fremont, California, car factory, that would suggest his attention has shifted away from the batteries to car assembly. Tesla wants to double production in the next three months, to 5,000 cars a week. Fremont is where that will, or won\u2019t, happen.  Even if Tesla reaches its first-quarter production target, it\u2019s not clear whether the company will be able to sustain and build off of it. According to Musk\u2019s latest posts on Twitter, the company hasn\u2019t emerged from production hell just yet.

On Thursday evening, Tesla filed with regulators to disclose precisely this:  On March 7, 2018, Eric Branderiz left Tesla for personal reasons. Tesla appreciates Eric's service to the company.  Brevity, the soul of wit, is perhaps the specter of foreboding in this case. Branderiz was hired from SunPower Corp. in October 2016 to be Tesla's corporate controller and chief accountant. His base salary was $300,000 a year, but the real draw was a $5 million equity grant to vest over four years. To be clear, I don't know what his personal reasons are. Regardless, that vesting schedule suggests he's leaving a chunk of money on the table.  He isn't the only high-profile departure. The last one was announced a month ago on Tesla's earnings call by none other than CEO Elon Musk, with not just brevity but a hint of insouciance:  Actually, one thing we forgot to mention is John McNeill, who is heading up our sales and service group, is departing the company. We wish him well in his future career. And going forward, I will be having the sales and service report directly to me. There are no plans to search for a replacement.  Just the guy running the sales effort during possibly the most critical launch of a Tesla vehicle yet. No biggie.  Actually, that is kind of how the bond market seems to be taking it. Those bonds mentioned above are now yielding about 6.3 percent, a full percentage point above their coupon. But the spreads betray a more laid-back attitude:  So? Tesla's bond yield is up but that's down to Treasuries selling off rather than a blowout in spreads Source: Bloomberg  These spreads actually looked low even before the news of Branderiz's departure, considering Tesla's growing reliance on negative working capital to fund its operations (see this) and its net debt doubling last year to $6.8 billion (see this).  There's more to be found off the balance sheet, too. According to Tesla's annual filing, which dropped a couple of weeks ago, it's potentially on the hook for an estimated $8.5 billion of contracted purchases over the next three years alone. Most of this relates to batteries coming from Panasonic Corp. and emphasizes the importance of Model 3 production catching up with the vast ambitions set ahead of it.  Much Obliged Tesla's contractual obligations, related mainly to battery purchases, are bigger than its long-term debt Source: Company filing  That fixed-income investors are fine with this is, of course, a function of their primary defense; namely, Tesla's gravity-defying stock price. The potential for an eighth equity sale to refill company coffers serves to salve any wounds inflicted by slipping Model 3 targets or senior managers sipping away. In early trading on Friday morning, the shares were down less than 1 percent.  Like I Said: So? Tesla's share price shrugs off setbacks with remarkable ease Source: Bloomberg  What might cause the market's confidence to crack? It's impossible to say, though the Model 3's woes represent the most acute threat. We are now just over three weeks away from the March 31 deadline to get weekly production up to 2,500; a target that's been reset several times already. Bloomberg's own tracker estimates the current rate at less than 700.  It's worth pointing out that Adam Jonas, Morgan Stanley's usually bullish analyst on Tesla, on Friday morning issued a new report that offered a curious cocktail combining optimism about the company overcoming its immediate problems with the notion that investors might use that outcome to \"exit\" the stock. The rationale is that even if Tesla gets the Model 3 going, competitive pressure and vast infrastructure needs to realize the company's ambitions will constrain it. As Jonas puts it:  We had harbored greater conviction on the long side, as we felt that investors underestimated the scope of the addressable market and the value of Tesla\u2019s platform (hardware, software, people, physical infrastructure and network effect).

But now, after a spate of fresh setbacks in the past week, including a fatal Tesla crash and a credit-rating downgrade, bondholders are asking hard questions about whether Musk can deliver on his bold promise to bring electric cars to the masses before the company runs out of cash.

Tesla\u2019s woes have played out most visibly in the stock market, with its shares suffering a two-day, 15 percent drop that\u2019s the biggest since 2016. But surging borrowing costs, which are now near 8 percent, could hamper the carmaker\u2019s ability to finance itself at a critical time.  For Bloomberg\u2019s Tesla Model 3 production tracker, click here.  A representative for Tesla didn\u2019t immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.  The company, which has never shown an annual profit in the 15 years since it was founded, will need to raise over $2 billion to cover not only its cash burn this year, but also about $1.2 billion of debt that comes due by 2019, Moody\u2019s Investors Service analyst Bruce Clark said in a report Tuesday.  Tesla is burning through money so fast that, without additional financing, it would run out of cash before year-end. To put that into perspective, that amounts to more than $6,500 every minute of every day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  \u2018Crunch Time\u2019  That puts the company in \u201ccrunch time\u201d now to improve margins, Cowen & Co. analysts led by Jeffrey Osborne said in a note Tuesday. Tesla will report first-quarter production figures for the Model 3 early next week. While the company has said it expects to end the quarter making 2,500 Model 3s per week, analysts are skeptical.  The Tesla Model 3. Photographer: Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg  \u201cBased on our own checks as well as user reported registration data found online, Tesla\u2019s model 3 ramp is likely still moving slower than management\u2019s previously pushed out targets,\u201d Osborne wrote.  Another production miss wouldn\u2019t make it any easier for Tesla to persuade bond investors to hand over more money. While shareholders just approved a massive $2.6 billion pay package for Musk, three executives have headed for the exits this quarter, including two from the company\u2019s finance team.  \u2018On The Precipice\u2019  \u201cPeople are looking at the abyss here, they\u2019re looking at it spiral out of control,\u201d said Jack Flaherty, a portfolio manager at GAM Holding AG. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely on the precipice.\u201d  To Diamond Hill\u2019s Zox, who didn\u2019t buy Tesla\u2019s bonds last year, yields are still too low to offset the risks of lending to a business in its early growth phase. They would need be between 10 to 12 percent to get him interested.  And with a junk rating of Caa1 from Moody\u2019s on Tesla\u2019s unsecured bonds -- seven levels below investment grade -- coming back to the market might prove to be too onerous in any case, says Bloomberg Intelligence\u2019s Joel Levington.  The company might need to consider selling equity, issuing convertible bonds and structured debt or taking out bank loans, he said.  \u201cI would think it\u2019d be off the table,\u201d said Levington, referring to another unsecured bond sale. \u201cThey have to look at all options.\u201d  \u2014 With assistance by Austin Weinstein, Dana Hull, Sally Bakewell, Taka Endo, and Claire Boston", "stock": "TSLA"}, {"url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-21/tesla-investors-are-said-to-approve-2-6-billion-award-for-musk", "label": -1, "source": "bloomberg", "date": "2018-03-21", "article": "Here\u2019s what Tesla Inc. shareholders just bought for $2.6 billion: a stronger guarantee that Elon Musk will stick around for at least the next decade.  Investors on Wednesday approved what may be the largest compensation deal in history for its chief executive officer, pegged on ambitions to turn Tesla into one of the world\u2019s largest companies as it ventures beyond solar panels and electric cars. If successful, the award could end up being worth more than $50 billion -- a sum so large it might just ensure that Musk\u2019s array of other passions and esoteric side projects won\u2019t steal too much time from his work at Tesla.  \u201cI expect to remain CEO for the foreseeable future,\u201d Musk said during last month\u2019s earnings call with analysts. But he didn\u2019t rule out handing over the CEO responsibilities if a suitable successor would appear, allowing him to focus on \u201cdesign and engineering, which is what I like doing best.\u201d  Musk is also the CEO of Mars-bound Space Exploration Technologies Corp. and has embarked on several other projects of late, including tunnel digger Boring Co. and a brain-computer interface startup called Neuralink. The new award -- which was approved at Tesla\u2019s special meeting in Fremont, California -- requires Musk remain at the electric-car maker either as CEO or executive chairman and chief product officer.  Tesla said in a filing that about 73 percent of the votes cast in person or by proxy at the meeting were in favor of the award, excluding those owned directly or indirectly by Musk and his brother, Kimbal.  Profit Ahead?  Tesla shares traded higher following news of the vote. The stock closed up 1.9 percent in New York. A spokesman for the company declined to comment.  The pay plan helps ensure Musk will remain at Tesla at least until 2028, but several questions loom. The award contains a number of audacious goals and no detailed plan of how to get there, including when the manufacturer will turn its first-ever annual profit. Additionally, a series of executive exits in the past year has left Tesla without a clear No. 2 -- a potential concern even if Musk stays front and center.  This quarter alone, Tesla has lost Jon McNeill, president of sales and service; its accounting chief Eric Branderiz; and Susan Repo, corporate treasurer and vice president of finance. Going back a full year, Tesla has also lost executives including Chief Financial Officer Jason Wheeler; Chris Lattner, an Apple Inc. hire who left after leading Tesla\u2019s Autopilot engineering team for less than six months; Kurt Kelty, a senior battery executive; and Diarmuid O\u2019Connell, vice president of business development.  Jamie Albertine, analyst at Consumer Edge Research, said he sees Tesla needing to hire a chief operating officer or a new head of service \u201cat some point in the near future.\u201d Musk said on the earnings call last month that McNeill\u2019s department would report directly to him and that \u201cthere are no plans to search for a replacement,\u201d even as some investors fear he\u2019s spreading himself too thin. In 2016, Musk said he was working so hard, he kept a sleeping bag in a conference room adjacent to Tesla\u2019s production line in Fremont.  Billionaire Bait  The award, which won\u2019t vest unless a set of ambitious financial goals are met, had been cheered by some large Tesla investors who said it would help the CEO drive the business forward. Critics, including the two largest proxy advisers, said it was too costly and questioned why Musk, a billionaire who has about half his wealth tied up in company stock, needed more equity to stay motivated.  The board needed majority approval to make the grant, which likely is the largest one-time compensation deal ever awarded. Tesla had said Musk and his brother, who\u2019s a company director, wouldn\u2019t vote their shares.  Tesla Targets Musk's award will pay when Tesla hits pairs of goals, with one tied to market value Source: Proxy filing  Under the new plan, Musk will earn one-12th of the options every time Tesla hits a pair of goals: one tied to its market value and the other linked to either revenue or earnings excluding certain charges. For Musk to get all the options, Tesla would have to become worth $650 billion -- more than Facebook Inc. -- and produce more revenue than Procter & Gamble Co.  Tesla has said in regulatory filings that Musk\u2019s award could yield him more than $50 billion if all goals are achieved. Some investors have said the package aligns with their interests, signaling they don\u2019t mind if Musk gets wealthier, as long as they also see big returns.  Ross Gerber tweet to Elon Musk and Tesla Inc. Source: @GerberKawasaki/Twitter Inc.  Large shareholders including Baillie Gifford & Co. and T.

Rowe Price and shareholder Fidelity, which holds almost 10 percent of Tesla stock, declined to comment.  Potential Dilution  California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, the second-largest pension fund in the U.S., didn\u2019t support the plan, citing concerns about potential dilution and an absence of profitability goals.

The system requires drivers to keep their hands on the steering wheel, and emits escalating alerts if they don't.  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said on Tuesday it was sending two investigators to examine the crash of a Tesla vehicle apparently traveling in semi-autonomous mode and a fire truck in California.  In a post on Twitter, the federal safety agency said the \"field investigation\" would examine both driver and vehicle factors in Monday's accident.  This is the second time the safety board has probed a Tesla crash that may be linked to Autopilot, Tesla's semi-autonomous driver assist system that handles some tasks and allows drivers under certain conditions to take their hands off the wheel for extended periods.  The Culver City, California fire department said in a Twitter post that on Monday an engine was struck by a Tesla \"traveling at 65 mph. The driver reports the vehicle was on Autopilot. Amazingly there were no injuries.\"  The NTSB faulted Tesla in a prior fatal Autopilot crash.  In September, the NTSB chairman said \"operational limitations\" in the Tesla Model S played a \"major role\" in a May 2016 crash that killed a driver using the vehicle's semi-autonomous system.  The limits on the system include factors such as Tesla being unable to ensure driver attention even when the car is traveling at high speeds, ensuring Autopilot is used only on certain roads and monitoring driver engagement, NTSB said in September.  The NTSB recommended auto safety regulators and automakers take steps to ensure that semi-autonomous systems are not misused.  \"System safeguards were lacking,\" NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said.  Tesla declined to comment Tuesday on the new probe. In September the company said, \"Autopilot significantly increases safety,\" citing an earlier government study that suggested the system reduced the incidence of crashes.  The company has emphasized that \"Autopilot is not a fully self-driving technology and drivers need to remain attentive at all times.\"  Joshua Brown, a 40-year-old Ohio man, was killed near Williston, Florida, when his Model S collided with a truck while it was engaged in the Autopilot mode.  The fatal incident raised questions about the safety of systems that can perform driving tasks for extended stretches of time with little or no human intervention, but which cannot completely replace human drivers.  The NTSB said Tesla could have taken further steps to prevent the system's misuse, and faulted the driver for not paying attention. The agency said the Autopilot system operated as designed but did not ensure drivers paid adequate attention.

Falcon Heavy's launch sent Musk's personal 2008 red Tesla Roadster on a voyage toward Mars orbit with a \"Starman\" dummy in the driver's seat.  Planetary scientists are concerned about bacterial contamination on Musk's car in case it crashes into Mars \u2014 a planet that may host alien microbes.  However, new calculations show the Tesla will most likely hit Earth, Venus, or the sun.  On February 6, SpaceX launched the world's most powerful operational rocket, called Falcon Heavy, for the first time.  The launch sent company founder Elon Musk's own red Tesla Roadster on a path that crosses the orbit of Mars. This attracted the attention of researchers worried about an eventual crash into the red planet, which would contaminate the world \u2014 and any alien microbes living there.  But planetary science researchers can now breathe a little easier, if a new study about the Roadster's fate is correct.  Musk put his Roadster on top of the 230-foot-tall rocket with a spacesuit-clad dummy named \"Starman\" in the driver's seat. Launching the car demonstrated Falcon Heavy's capabilities and was reportedly a backup plan for a scientific NASA or military payload.  The Roadster's short-lived yet unparalleled camera feeds, overall silliness (as Musk has described it), and far-flung path through space captured global attention.  But not all of it has proved welcome.  SpaceX founder Elon Musk in a press conference after the launch of Falcon Heavy. Dave Mosher/Business Insider The Planetary Society's Jason Davis bemoaned the planetary protection risk posed by Musk's un-sterilized car crashing into Mars and sprinkling debris coated with bacteria, viruses, and fungi all over the planet. The reason: alien microbes may be hiding out in Martian soil.  \"NASA goes to great lengths sterilizing spacecraft designed to land on Mars, in order to make sure there's no chance of Earthly microbes contaminating the surface,\" Davis wrote in a post before launch. \"Such a contamination could harm existing life and muddle scientific efforts to search for said life.\"  But that risk now appears minimal, according to a new scientific study titled \"The random walk of cars and their collision probabilities with planets.\"  Three researchers at the University of Toronto posted their paper on Tuesday to the pre-print arXiv server and submitted to the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.  Where and when Musk's Tesla will most likely crash  A chart showing the location of Elon Musk's Tesla Roadster in space on February 15, 2018. WhereIsTesla.com  Hanno Rein, an astrophysicist and lead author of the study, said the roughly week-long research came out of advanced orbital-mechanics computer simulations.  \"Earth is the most likely place the car will crash, followed by Venus, and then the sun,\" Rein told Business Insider, and likely within 10 million years \u2014 not hundreds of millions or possibly billions, as Musk has suggested.  To arrive at that conclusion, Rein and his colleagues started with orbital tracking data for the Roadster posted by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Then they plugged that data into simulation software called REBOUND, which allowed them to fast-forward the car's likeliest orbital paths through the solar system over the next few million years.  That data suggest Musk's car will fly out past Mars orbit, spending very little time there, and then swing back around, over and over again.  \"Every 30 years or so, it will come relatively close to the Earth,\" Rein said, where it will get a gravitational tug. \"This causes a change of a few percent in some of the orbital parameters. The distance to the sun would change slightly, for example, and the orbit's eccentricity.\"  The calculations suggest the Roadster will come within one Earth-moon distance of our planet within 100 years, possibly enabling new Earth-based telescope views.  Elon Musk's red Tesla Roadster before launching on a Falcon Heavy rocket toward Mars orbit. Elon Musk/SpaceX; Instagram  But after its third flyby, Rein said the Roadster will take on an increasingly chaotic and somewhat unpredictable path through space. That's because those gravitational tugs near Earth's orbit \u2014 where the car will spend most of its time compared to other bodies in the system \u2014 can \"lead to a huge change afterward,\" Rein said.  By running hundreds of different simulations of those orbital possibilities out to 3.5 million years from today, Rein and his colleagues figured out there's a 6% chance of the Roadster crashing into Earth and a 2.5% chance of crashing into Venus during that time.  \"We've not seen any single collision with Mars in 240 simulations, though we continue to run them and see what happens,\" Rein said. \"The likely outcome is that it will crash, in tens of millions of years, into Earth or Venus or the sun.\"  Astronomers are tracking the car in space  Two other astronomers \u2014 Gianluca Masi of The Virtual Telescope Project and Michael Schwartz of Tenagra Observatories, Ltd. \u2014 also used JPL data to track the Roadster.  Last week, they managed to photograph the car flying beyond the moon moving at a speed of roughly 25,000 miles per hour.  The vehicle is reflective enough to see through a telescope, at least for now, leading to what they called a \"stunning\" animation of several images.  Masi said he and Schwartz will continue to track the Roadster for as long as possible.  \"The object is slowly fading: you can image it now with a 6\" or so scope,\" Masi told Business Insider in an email. \"In one month or so it will need a much larger scope to be imaged (16\" or larger).\"", "stock": "TSLA"}, {"url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-model-3-arrives-at-tesla-stores-nationwide-gigafactory-issues-2018-1", "label": 1, "source": "business-insider", "date": "2018-01-26", "article": "Tesla Model 3.

LONDON \u2014 Tesla on Tuesday announced a new compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk, and he will not get paid a single dollar unless his company's shareholders do extremely well.  Perhaps unfortunately for the 400,000 or so people who have preordered a Tesla electric vehicle, Musk's compensation won't be tied to his company's ability to build cars.  Tesla has a history of struggling with production and has missed key targets. For example, after Musk said Tesla aimed to produce 20,000 Model 3 vehicles a month by this past December, the company delivered only 1,550 in the entire fourth quarter. Musk has also said he wants to build 500,000 vehicles this year, but that now seems unlikely given the now delayed production of the Model 3.  An analyst note from December projected just 100,000 Model S Teslas coming off the line in 2018.  Tesla's stock has continued to outpace its competitors', soaring by over 1,000% since the carmaker went public in 2010.  Rather than focus on building cars, as GM and Ford do, Musk's new compensation schedule is \"entirely contingent on achieving market cap and operational milestones that would make Tesla one of the most valuable companies in the world,\" according to a press release.  For Musk's compensation to fully vest, \"Tesla's market cap would have to grow to $650 billion (an increase of almost $600 billion), and important revenue and profitability goals would also have to be achieved,\" the company said.  \"Elon will receive no guaranteed compensation of any kind \u2014 no salary, no cash bonuses, and no equity that vests simply by the passage of time,\" the release continued.

In a blog post tonight, Tesla said it\u2019s not yet clear what happened in the time leading up to the accident. Tesla also said it does not yet know what caused it.  Tesla did note that, according to its data, Tesla owners have driven that same stretch of Highway 101 with Autopilot engaged about 85,000 times since Tesla first rolled out the automated control system in 2015. Since the beginning of this year, Tesla drivers have successfully handled that stretch of the highway 20,000 times, according to Tesla.  \u201cThe reason this crash was so severe is that the crash attenuator, a highway safety barrier which is designed to reduce the impact into a concrete lane divider, had either been removed or crushed in a prior accident without being replaced,\u201d the company wrote.  Below, you can see what the barrier was supposed to look like versus what it looked like the day before the accident.

The company went on to say it has \u201cnever seen this level of damage to a Model X in any other crash.\u201d  As previously reported, the accident also caused a fire. In the event there is a fire, Tesla says its battery packs are designed so that people have enough time to get out of the car.  \u201cAccording to witnesses, that appears to be what happened here as we understand there were no occupants still in the Model X by the time the fire could have presented a risk,\u201d Tesla wrote. \u201cSerious crashes like this can result in fire regardless of the type of car, and Tesla\u2019s billions of miles of actual driving data shows that a gas car in the United States is five times more likely to experience a fire than a Tesla vehicle.\u201d  The promise of Tesla\u2019s Autopilot system is to reduce car accidents.

The National Transportation Safety Board is currently investigating the crash.  Tesla says it willingly withdrew from NTSB investigation  Tesla says it willingly withdrew from the party agreement with the National Transportation Safety Board, adding that the NTSB is more concerned with \u201cpress headlines than actually promoting safety,\u201d a Tesla spokesperson told TechCrunch via email. \u201cLast week, in a conversation with the NTSB, we were told that if we made additional statements before their 12-24 month investigative process is complete, we would no longer be a party to the investigation agreement,\u201d a Tesla spokesperson said in a statement to TechCrunch. \u201cOn Tuesday, we chose to withdraw from the agreement and issued a statement to correct misleading claims that had been made about Autopilot \u2014 claims which made it seem as though Autopilot creates safety problems when the opposite is true.\u201d This comes after the NTSB said it revoked Tesla\u2019s party status in the investigation regarding the fatal crash involving one of Tesla\u2019s Model X cars. The NTSB said it did so because Tesla, without permission from the NTSB, relayed information to the public regarding the investigation. Tesla went on to note the prevalence of automotive fatalities in the United States in comparison to fatalities involving cars with Autopilot. Tesla says for every 320 million miles cars equipped with Autopilot drive, there is one fatality, including known pedestrian fatalities. That\u2019s compared to one fatality for every 86 million miles driven for all vehicles, Tesla said. \u201cIf you are driving a Tesla equipped with Autopilot hardware, you are 3.7 times less likely to be involved in a fatal accident and this continues to improve,\u201d the spokesperson said. Tesla also alleges its \u201cclear in our conversations\u201d with the NTSB that it cares less about safety and more about press headlines. \u201cAmong other things, they repeatedly released partial bits of incomplete information to the media in violation of their own rules, at the same time that they were trying to prevent us from telling all the facts,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe this is right and we will be making an official complaint to Congress. We will also be issuing a Freedom Of Information Act request to understand the reasoning behind their focus on the safest cars in America while they ignore the cars that are the least safe. Perhaps there is a sound rationale for this, but we cannot imagine what that could possibly be.\u201d Tesla also took time to note how the NTSB is an advisory body, rather than a regulatory one, and how Tesla has a \u201cstrong and positive relationship\u201d with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) \u201cWhen tested by NHTSA, Model S and Model X each received five stars not only overall but in every sub-category,\u201d the Tesla spokesperson said. \u201cThis was the only time an SUV had ever scored that well. Moreover, of all the cars that NHTSA has ever tested, Model S and Model X scored as the two cars with the lowest probability of injury. There is no company that cares more about safety and the evidence speaks for itself.\u201d When reached for comment pertaining to Tesla\u2019s claims, the NTSB says it stands by the press release it issued earlier and has nothing to add. Meanwhile, the NHTSA says its investigation is ongoing. \u201cThe agency is in contact with local investigators, consistent with NHTSA\u2019s vigilant oversight and authority over the safety of all motor vehicles and equipment,\u201d an NHTSA spokesperson said in a statement to TechCrunch. \u201cNHTSA is dispatching its Special Crash Investigation Team and will take action as appropriate.\u201d  Tesla is no longer working with NTSB in fatal Model X crash investigation  In light of Tesla going a bit rogue and disclosing details of the fatal crash that involved Autopilot, the National Transportation Safety Board is removing Tesla as a party in the investigation. \u201cThe NTSB took this action because Tesla violated the party agreement by releasing investigative information before it was vetted and confirmed by the NTSB,\u201d the NTSB wrote in a press release today. \u201cSuch releases of incomplete information often lead to speculation and incorrect assumptions about the probable cause of a crash, which does a disservice to the investigative process and the traveling public.\u201d This is not too surprising, given the NTSB said it was \u201cunhappy\u201d with Tesla following its March 30 disclosure that Autopilot was engaged during the crash. Losing party status means Tesla is no longer able to provide technical assistance to the NTSB. As the NTSB notes, having party status is a \u201cprivilege\u201d that enables two-way information sharing. \u201cIt is unfortunate that Tesla, by its actions, did not abide by the party agreement,\u201d said NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt. \u201cWe decided to revoke Tesla\u2019s party status and informed Mr. Musk in a phone call last evening and via letter today. While we understand the demand for information that parties face during an NTSB investigation, uncoordinated releases of incomplete information do not further transportation safety or serve the public interest.\u201d The NTSB says it\u2019s rare to revoke party status, but that it has happened before. While Tesla is no longer an official party, the NTSB says it expects Tesla to cooperate with any future data requests. While Tesla is no longer a party in this specific case, the company is still working with the NTSB in other investigations, like the one pertaining to a crash in Lake Forest, California and one in Culver City. On Wednesday, Tesla provided Bloomberg with a statement implying Tesla willingly withdrew from the party agreement. \u201cTesla withdrew from the party agreement with the NTSB because it requires that we not release information about Autopilot to the public, a requirement which we believe fundamentally affects public safety negatively,\u201d the company said in a statement to Bloomberg. \u201cWe believe in transparency, so an agreement that prevents public release of information for over a year is unacceptable.\u201d In a lengthy statement, Tesla said it willingly chose to withdraw from the agreement: Last week, in a conversation with the NTSB, we were told that if we made additional statements before their 12-24 month investigative process is complete, we would no longer be a party to the investigation agreement. On Tuesday, we chose to withdraw from the agreement and issued a statement to correct misleading claims that had been made about Autopilot \u2014 claims which made it seem as though Autopilot creates safety problems when the opposite is true. In the US, there is one automotive fatality every 86 million miles across all vehicles. For Tesla, there is one fatality, including known pedestrian fatalities, every 320 million miles in vehicles equipped with Autopilot hardware. If you are driving a Tesla equipped with Autopilot hardware, you are 3.7 times less likely to be involved in a fatal accident and this continues to improve. It\u2019s been clear in our conversations with the NTSB that they\u2019re more concerned with press headlines than actually promoting safety. Among other things, they repeatedly released partial bits of incomplete information to the media in violation of their own rules, at the same time that they were trying to prevent us from telling all the facts. We don\u2019t believe this is right and we will be making an official complaint to Congress. We will also be issuing a Freedom Of Information Act request to understand the reasoning behind their focus on the safest cars in America while they ignore the cars that are the least safe. Perhaps there is a sound rationale for this, but we cannot imagine what that could possibly be. Something the public may not be aware of is that the NTSB is not a regulatory body, it is an advisory body. The regulatory body for the automotive industry in the US is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) with whom we have a strong and positive relationship. After doing a comprehensive study, NHTSA found that even the early version of Tesla Autopilot resulted in 40% fewer crashes. Autopilot has improved substantially since then. When tested by NHTSA, Model S and Model X each received five stars not only overall but in every sub-category. This was the only time an SUV had ever scored that well. Moreover, of all the cars that NHTSA has ever tested, Model S and Model X scored as the two cars with the lowest probability of injury. There is no company that cares more about safety and the evidence speaks for itself.  NTSB is \u2018unhappy\u2019 about Tesla publicly disclosing details of fatal crash  Tesla provided some more details on Friday about the fatal crash involving one of its Model X vehicles, but the National Transportation Safety Board isn\u2019t particularly happy about that, The Washington Post first reported. \u201cIn each of our investigations involving a Tesla vehicle, Tesla has been extremely cooperative on assisting with the vehicle data,\u201d NTSB spokesperson Chris O\u2019Neil told TechCrunch \u201cHowever, the NTSB is unhappy with the release of investigative information by Tesla.\u201d That\u2019s because those involved in an NTSB investigation are required to inform the Board of information releases before doing so. \u201cThe uncoordinated release of investigative information can affect how other parties work with us in the future so we take each unauthorized release seriously,\u201d O\u2019Neil told TechCrunch. \u201cHowever, this release will not hinder our investigation.\u201d Last week, Tesla said Autopilot, the company\u2019s semi-autonomous mode that can change lanes and maintain proper vehicle positions and safe speeds, was engaged in the moments leading up to the crash. \u201cThe driver had received several visual and one audible hands-on warning earlier in the drive and the driver\u2019s hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds prior to the collision,\u201d Tesla wrote in a blog post. \u201cThe driver had about five seconds and 150 meters of unobstructed view of the concrete divider with the crushed crash attenuator, but the vehicle logs show that no action was taken.\u201d While Tesla and the NTSB have made some early observations, there\u2019s still more work to be done as part of the investigation. The NTSB, for example, still needs Tesla\u2019s help to decode the data the vehicle recorded and ultimately determine the \u201cprobable cause\u201d of the crash, NTSB spokesperson O\u2019Neil told the Post. The investigation has also expanded to look into the concerns the driver had previously expressed about Autopilot. Walter Huang, the owner of the car who died as a result of the crash, had previously taken his car into the Tesla dealership, saying his car had a way of veering toward the exact barrier his car hit, ABC7 reported last week. Tesla, however, says it has no record of Huang complaining about Autopilot. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing a thorough search of our service records and we cannot find anything suggesting that the customer ever complained to Tesla about the performance of Autopilot,\u201d a Tesla spokesperson told TechCrunch. \u201cThere was a concern raised once about navigation not working correctly, but Autopilot\u2019s performance is unrelated to navigation.\u201d Tesla declined to comment on the NTSB\u2019s concerns.  Tesla says fatal crash involved Autopilot  Tesla has provided another update to last week\u2019s fatal crash. As it turns out, Tesla said the driver had Autopilot on with the adaptive cruise control follow-distance set to minimum. However, it seems the driver ignored the vehicle\u2019s warnings to take back control. \u201cThe driver had received several visual and one audible hands-on warning earlier in the drive and the driver\u2019s hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds prior to the collision,\u201d Tesla wrote in a blog post. \u201cThe driver had about five seconds and 150 meters of unobstructed view of the concrete divider with the crushed crash attenuator, but the vehicle logs show that no action was taken.\u201d The promise of Tesla\u2019s Autopilot system is to reduce car accidents. In the company\u2019s blog post, Tesla notes Autopilot reduces crash rates by 40 percent, according to an independent review by the U.S. government. Of course, that does not mean the technology is perfect in preventing all accidents. As Tesla previously noted, the crash was so severe because the middle divider on the highway had been damaged in an earlier accident. Tesla also cautioned that Autopilot does not prevent all accidents, but it does make them less likely to occur. No one knows about the accidents that didn\u2019t happen, only the ones that did. The consequences of the public not using Autopilot, because of an inaccurate belief that it is less safe, would be extremely severe. There are about 1.25 million automotive deaths worldwide. If the current safety level of a Tesla vehicle were to be applied, it would mean about 900,000 lives saved per year. We expect the safety level of autonomous cars to be 10 times safer than non-autonomous cars. In the past, when we have brought up statistical safety points, we have been criticized for doing so, implying that we lack empathy for the tragedy that just occurred. Nothing could be further from the truth. We care deeply for and feel indebted to those who chose to put their trust in us. However, we must also care about people now and in the future whose lives may be saved if they know that Autopilot improves safety. None of this changes how devastating an event like this is or how much we feel for our customer\u2019s family and friends. We are incredibly sorry for their loss. This development, of course, comes in light of a fatal accident involving one of Uber\u2019s self-driving cars in Tempe, Arizona.  What Tesla knows about the fatal Model X crash  Tesla has shed some more light on the fatal crash and fire involving a Model X car last week. In a blog post tonight, Tesla said it\u2019s not yet clear what happened in the time leading up to the accident. Tesla also said it does not yet know what caused it. Tesla did note that, according to its data, Tesla owners have driven that same stretch of Highway 101 with Autopilot engaged about 85,000 times since Tesla first rolled out the automated control system in 2015. Since the beginning of this year, Tesla drivers have successfully handled that stretch of the highway 20,000 times, according to Tesla. \u201cThe reason this crash was so severe is that the crash attenuator, a highway safety barrier which is designed to reduce the impact into a concrete lane divider, had either been removed or crushed in a prior accident without being replaced,\u201d the company wrote. Below, you can see what the barrier was supposed to look like versus what it looked like the day before the accident. Tesla says it obtained the image of the more recent photo from the dash cam of a witness who regularly makes the commute. The company went on to say it has \u201cnever seen this level of damage to a Model X in any other crash.\u201d As previously reported, the accident also caused a fire. In the event there is a fire, Tesla says its battery packs are designed so that people have enough time to get out of the car. \u201cAccording to witnesses, that appears to be what happened here as we understand there were no occupants still in the Model X by the time the fire could have presented a risk,\u201d Tesla wrote. \u201cSerious crashes like this can result in fire regardless of the type of car, and Tesla\u2019s billions of miles of actual driving data shows that a gas car in the United States is five times more likely to experience a fire than a Tesla vehicle.\u201d The promise of Tesla\u2019s Autopilot system is to reduce car accidents. In the company\u2019s blog post, Tesla notes Autopilot reduces crash rates by 40 percent, according to an independent review by the U.S. government. Of course, that does not mean the technology is perfect in preventing all accidents.

Few have seen it (the plant is off-limits at present), but we know this: Tesla has spent c.2x what a traditional OEM spends per unit on capacity.\u201d  In addition to automating stamping, paint and welding, the report states, Tesla is also trying to automate the final assembly process, which entails the actual placement of parts into the cars.  \u201cIt talks of two-level final lines with robots automating parts sequencing,\u201d the report states. \u201cThis is where Tesla seems to be facing problems (as well as in welding & battery pack assembly).\u201d  The report describes how automation is expensive and \u201cstatistically inversely correlated to quality.\u201d It goes on to note how if Tesla tries to automate 50 percent of the tasks in final assembly, it would only cut out about five hours of human labor. Warburton and Sacconaghi later write,  But while all that exotic capital might allow Tesla to remove 5 workers, it will then need to hire a skilled engineer to manage, programme and maintain robots for $100 an hour (our estimate of a robotic engineers\u2019 hourly rate). So the net labour saving may be only $50 per unit. Yet putting the automation into the plant seems to involve an apparent capital cost that\u2019s $4,000 higher per unit of capacity than for a normal plant.

The board unveiled a pay deal for Elon Musk, the chief executive, on Tuesday that will make him nearly $60 billion if he hits new targets by 2028. That\u2019s on top of the $100 billion gain the electric-car pioneer would make on his existing stake.  Mr. Musk\u2019s new targets are even more ambitious than the 10-year goals from 2012 that he blew through years early. The potential value of share grants totaling 12 percent of the company is vast, but at least the Tesla board has done much more than the usual lip service in setting a serious challenge.  It involves Mr. Musk hitting two sets of metrics. First, Tesla\u2019s market capitalization has to reach $650 billion \u2014 more than 10 times its current level and a valuation that would be fourth among today\u2019s publicly listed companies behind Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft, and just ahead of Amazon.  Second, he must turbocharge Tesla\u2019s financial performance. That requires either growing annual revenue to $175 billion, almost 15 times 2017\u2019s expected top line, or making $14 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a figure that may come in at just over $500 million for last year. There are 12 steps along the route to the maximum payout.  Reaching the revenue target could mean selling well over 2 million of Tesla\u2019s current and planned vehicles, Breakingviews calculates. That level of sales would be in the same ballpark as BMW \u2014 and last year\u2019s total for Tesla was barely over 100,000 vehicles. That doesn\u2019t allow for any surge in the company\u2019s solar-panel and electric-storage business, which at present contributes a single-digit percentage to the top line. Still, to get close would require Tesla to dominate the market for electric cars even as General Motors, Nissan and others ramp up their efforts.  One model for Musk could be Amazon, whose $177 billion of expected 2017 revenue would mark a 12-fold increase from 2007. Founder Jeff Bezos\u2019s stock has surged to 18 times its value a decade ago. Yet at the level that Mr. Musk is now aiming for, financial incentives can lose meaning. With a 20 percent stake already worth $12 billion, hitting his targets may motivate the entrepreneur more powerfully than money.", "stock": "TSLA"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/29/business/dealbook/tech-stocks-facebook-nvidia-tesla.html", "label": -1, "source": "the-new-york-times", "date": "2018-03-29", "article": "Still, Amazon cannot quietly hope that such criticism just fades away. Amazon\u2019s rapid growth, immense bargaining power, eye-catching initiatives and estimated 44 percent share of U.S. e-commerce sales make the company vulnerable to accusations that it is too powerful.  But if the Trump administration pursues ways to curtail the company, it would meet sizable obstacles.  Amazon accounts for only 4 percent of all retail sales in the United States, a recent survey estimated. Its revenue is a third of Walmart\u2019s and, even after its acquisition of Whole Foods, Amazon\u2019s footing in the grocery business is still small.  All in all, it would be hard to show that Amazon is pushing prices higher for consumers.  Amazon also has a loyal customer base \u2014 it has an estimated 90 million Prime members \u2014 and the public views it relatively favorably. When the Department of Justice\u2019s antitrust lawyers went after the proposed merger of Time Warner and AT&T, it was not targeting companies that were particularly popular with the public.  Still, some Amazon critics see a possible, though small, opening. In theory, an antitrust case could focus on the firms that supply Amazon with goods, according to Christopher L. Sagers, a law professor at Cleveland State University. If a company consistently uses its power to demand a good from suppliers at too low a price, the public could still get hurt. That\u2019s because the supply of the good could decline, its quality degrade, and there may be less innovation in the sector that produces the good, Mr. Sagers said.  But anyone bringing that against Amazon would have to explain why Walmart would not be a target, too.  \u2014 Peter Eavis  Photo  Public pension fund wants changes to Facebook\u2019s board.  The investment adviser to New York City\u2019s pension funds is calling for changes to Facebook\u2019s board to address the fallout from Cambridge Analytica\u2019s improper harvesting of information from 50 million users of the social network.

Stringer, wrote in a letter addressed to Dr. Susan Desmond-Hellmann, an independent director at Facebook and the chief executive of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation:  \u201cFacebook is now among the most valuable and, given the immense power and reach of its platform, most influential companies in the world. The very data collection and sharing practices that made its extraordinary growth possible, and that are the basis of the company\u2019s business model, are now facing potential regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world.\u201d  New York City\u2019s pension funds, which have more than $193 billion in assets under management, own $895 million of Facebook\u2019s shares, according to the letter. Even with the recent tumble in its shares, Facebook is valued at more than $450 billion.  In his letter, Mr. Stringer calls on Facebook\u2019s independent directors to take four steps to help restore investor confidence.  Here are the proposed changes:  1) Add at least three new independent directors to improve the board\u2019s ability to oversee the evolving risks Facebook faces.  2) Name an independent director as chairman, allowing Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive and chairman, to focus on running the company.  3) Create a committee of independent directors to oversee the company\u2019s data privacy policies and risks.  4) Institute a clawback policy so that the board can \u201crecoup executive pay in the event of violations of law, regulation or company policy.\u201d  Photo  Trump tweets Amazon does not pay enough taxes.  President Trump spoke out against Amazon on Thursday, saying that the online behemoth does not pay enough taxes and uses the United States postal system \u201cas their Delivery Boy.\u201d  The president\u2019s commentary, made in a Twitter post, comes amid reports that Mr. Trump has expressed an interest in reining in the e-commerce business.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Amazon and the company\u2019s founder, Jeff Bezos, are among Mr. Trump\u2019s regular Twitter targets. In December, Mr. Trump questioned whether the United States Post Office charges Amazon enough for package deliveries. And in August, Mr. Trump said Amazon hurts taxpaying businesses.  Amazon, however, does pay taxes \u2014 $412 million in 2016, for instance, according to the company\u2019s report to the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Axios reported on Wednesday that Mr. Trump has wondered aloud whether Amazon could be vulnerable to antitrust or competition laws.  \u201cTrump\u2019s wealthy friends tell him Amazon is destroying their businesses. His real estate buddies tell him \u2014 and he agrees \u2014 that Amazon is killing shopping malls and brick-and-mortar retailers.\u201d  Amazon shares fell more than 7 percent following that Axios article but recovered some of those losses after a White House official told Reuters that the company faced no particular policy changes. But the administration is always looking at its options, the official added. The stock closed down 4.4 percent Wednesday.  Shares were down nearly 2 percent in early trading.  Should shareholders worry? The GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives told Bloomberg that this regulatory threat was unlikely to change Amazon\u2019s business model, but it was still \u201cthe last thing nervous tech investors wanted to see today.\u201d  Retailers, at least, already have some reason to be cheerful.  And Amazon has another target market for expansion: housekeeping.  First quarter profits are going to be big.  Corporate American will start reporting first-quarter results in less than two weeks, and earnings are expected to be big.  Analysts estimate that profits at companies in the S.&P. 500 grew 17.3 percent this quarter, according to FactSet. If the forecasts prove accurate that would be highest earnings growth rate since the first quarter of 2011.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Perhaps most surprising, is that analysts have grown more optimistic on corporate earnings as the quarter progressed. The earnings forecast for the index rose 5.4 percent from the start of the quarter to the end. Typically, analysts lower their expectations as the quarter progresses. On average, the profit estimates for the index fall 3.7 percent from the start of the quarter to the end.  But there are reasons for investors to temper their enthusiasm. Analysts have not been as optimistic about the abilities of companies to increase sales. Revenue is expected to have grown 7.3 percent in the first quarter, up from a 7 percent rate at the start of the quarter.  That suggests analysts are not raising estimates because of increased sales. So why are they? Taxes. And the impact tax reform will have on bottom lines should moderate in the coming quarters.  That may already be happening. BofA Merrill Lynch\u2019s earnings revision ratio for the S.&P. 500 fell in March for the first time in three months. Of course, the pullback comes after the ratio hits the highest level on record in February, but it does suggest that earnings lift from tax reform has begun to wane.  Photo  Are we witnessing the end of a tech boom?  Investors, always willing to believe in technology companies, spent the last three years piling into their shares with abandon. Now the intellectual underpinnings of that rally are being tested.  Exhibit A: Facebook, down 20 percent from its recent high.  Exhibit B: Nvidia, off 12 percent from its recent high.  Exhibit C: Tesla, not a tech stock but in the FANG+ index.  Concerns about Tesla\u2019s ability to fund itself can also be seen in the trading of its debt.  The WSJ\u2019s Charley Grant explains:  Tesla can\u2019t simply cut spending to solve its cash challenge if it hopes to ramp up production. The company has racked up about $10 billion in long-term debt and has $23 billion in total liabilities. To survive long term, Tesla needs to stop overpromising and to scale back its ambitions to goals it actually can achieve. Right now, though, it just needs more money.  Peter Eavis notes that the latest problems for tech giants have raised deeper doubts:  After the Uber incident in Arizona, those companies may take a more realistic look at what they have to spend to create a technology that is efficient and safe, and conclude that they have to pull out of the race or pare back. Users of social media and regulators may prevent social media companies from sharing so much of their data with advertisers, and that could restrain revenue growth. And if the passion for two or three big tech companies wanes, the cooling may spread.  Photo  Barclays pays $2 billion to settle mortgage securities suit.

Mr. Musk once envisioned producing as many as 500,000 cars this year, and last summer he was hoping to be able to make 20,000 Model 3s a month by December. More recently, Tesla had aimed to produce at least 2,500 Model 3s per week by the end of the first quarter.

Concern has grown over the safety of Autopilot, its driver-assistance system, after a fatal crash on March 23 that occurred while the system was engaged. It was at least the third fatal crash that has taken place while a driver was using Autopilot.  On Friday, Tesla said the driver had not heeded several visual and audible warnings to put his hands on the steering wheel before his Model X hit a concrete barrier. Neither the driver nor the car appeared to activate the brakes before impact.  Also last week, Moody\u2019s Investors Service downgraded Tesla\u2019s credit rating and said the company risked running short of cash by the end of the year.

Tesla lost $2.24 billion on sales of $3.3 billion, which the market shrugged off, at least until recently. That tells you how the stock market values the future of both companies and of E.V.s in particular.  It\u2019s not a belief that\u2019s universally held.

Yet you want to believe that Mr. Musk can pull this off. He rescued Tesla once before, when the company was days away from running out of cash. And in SpaceX, Mr. Musk has proved that he can run a highly sophisticated private spacecraft company.  Tesla\u2019s problem, unfortunately, isn\u2019t rocket science. In some ways it\u2019s more complex.  Tesla can\u2019t seem to run an auto production line, something that the Detroit auto companies that Mr. Musk mocks are very good at. Ford\u2019s electric vehicles and hybrids, such as the Fusion Energi, may not match the Tesla Model X in style or speed, but Ford can knock out millions of fenders and hoods in its stamping operations with absolute certainty and to tight specifications.  Tesla is operating out of the former G.M./Toyota joint venture plant in Fremont, Calif., which produced more than 400,000 cars annually at its peak.

In recent days, though, Mr. Trump has targeted Amazon in tweets, asserting that the company has an unfair advantage. It\u2019s not clear what he could do to hurt Amazon\u2019s business, but the company\u2019s stock has plunged. Amazon\u2019s shares may well bounce back, but the criticism has added to investors\u2019 concerns about the outlook for large technology companies, whose soaring stock prices spearheaded the rally that took to the S.&P. 500 to its all-time high in January.  Too much blame can be placed on the White House, however.  Before investors began fretting about tech and trade, the underpinnings of the stock market\u2019s ascent were perhaps not as robust as they looked. Wall Street analysts expect earnings for the companies in the S.&P. 500 to increase 25 percent this year, according to data compiled by Standard & Poor\u2019s, an unusually large jump that was reflected in the stock market valuations. Much of that projected earnings increase is coming from tax cuts and some from expectations that companies\u2019 revenue would grow at a nice clip as global growth stayed strong.  The tax cuts are certainly going to improve profits. But rising interest rates around the world could weigh somewhat on companies\u2019 revenue growth. And if wages and other costs come in higher than expected \u2014 a significant possibility when the economy is suffering a shortage of some workers \u2014 profit margins could get squeezed. \u201cI don\u2019t think either of those are in the numbers,\u201d said Jim Paulsen, chief market strategist at the Leuthold Group.  \u2014 Peter Eavis  Photo  Not Funny  A little humor has not cleared the clouds over Tesla.  Shares in the company were once again sliding on Monday after the company\u2019s C.E.O., Elon Musk, joked on April 1 that Tesla had gone bankrupt, an apparent attempt to make light of concerns that the electric car maker is straining under its debt load.  Tesla\u2019s stock is now down 35 percent from its high of last year. A major reason for the slide is the company\u2019s struggles to meet production targets for its lower-priced Model 3 car. Delays, of course, raise questions about Tesla\u2019s ability to become an efficient mass producer of autos. The company needs to sell a significantly higher number of cars to generate the cash to finance its business and meet debt payments. Tesla is expected early this week to release its first-quarter production and delivery numbers.  Electrek, a publication that covers electric vehicles, reported late Monday morning that Mr. Musk had sent out an email to employees saying that the company was producing more than 2,000 Model 3s a week. Tesla\u2019s stock bounced after the report.  Tesla\u2019s technology is also facing intense scrutiny after one of its Model X cars crashed on March 23, killing the driver. Tesla said late Friday that its assisted driving system, called Autopilot, was engaged in the car before its collision with a concrete divider. As our colleague Neal E. Boudette wrote:  The accident renews questions about Autopilot, a signature feature of Tesla vehicles, and whether the company has gone far enough to ensure that it keeps drivers and passengers safe.  Tesla\u2019s website says one of Autopilot\u2019s safety features is \u201cAutomatic Emergency Braking.\u201d But a Tesla owner\u2019s manual warns riders that this feature \u201cis not designed to avoid a collision.\u201d Wired recently reported that systems like Autopilot are not necessarily designed to detect static obstacles. In the words of one expert:  Raj Rajkumar, who researches autonomous driving at Carnegie Mellon University, thinks those assumptions concern one of Tesla\u2019s key sensors. \u201cThe radars they use are apparently meant for detecting moving objects (as typically used in adaptive cruise control systems), and seem to be not very good in detecting stationary objects,\u201d he says.  Doubts about the fundamental capabilities of Tesla\u2019s Autopilot could crimp demand for its cars among a customer base that is often seeking the best technology.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Questions are also swirling around the timing of Tesla\u2019s announcement about the crash. In its first communication about the accident, the company said:  Out of respect for the privacy of our customer and his family, we do not plan to share any additional details until we conclude the investigation.  The investigation is not over. Yet Tesla went ahead and provided its update on Friday. The motive for doing so is not clear. The United States National Transportation Safety Board on Sunday said it was \u201cunhappy\u201d that Tesla had released information about the crash.  - Peter Eavis  Investors are running from FAANG stocks again.  Tech companies are again dragging down stocks on Wall Street.  The S.&P. 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite are off 3.1 percent and 3.5 percent Monday. The continued fall in the share prices of some of the biggest tech companies is weighing heavily on the indexes.  Amazon is down 5.4 percent, Netflix is off 5.9 percent, Facebook fell 3 percent, Google-parent Alphabet slipped 3.6 percent and Apple dropped 5.9 percent.  After leading the market higher for much of the past two years, tech stocks have hit some turbulence. Since March 16, Facebook, Alphabet, Netflix and Amazon are all down more than 12 percent, while Apple is down 7.3 percent.  Over that period the business models of those companies have come under increased scrutiny. News that Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm hired by President Trump\u2019s 2016 election campaign, gained access to private information on more than 50 million Facebook users has weighed not only on the shares of Facebook but on Alphabet as well. Amazon, meanwhile, has come under attack from President Trump.  In all, those companies have lost more than $300 billion in market value the past two weeks.  Photo  Trump continues to go after Amazon.  President Trump attacked the e-commerce again on Monday morning.  Monday\u2019s tweet is the latest over the past five days from Mr. Trump criticizing Amazon. Over that period, Mr. Trump has accused Amazon of not paying enough taxes, of putting thousands of local retailers out of business and of using the United States Postal Service as its \u201cDelivery Boy.\u201d  Mr. Trump\u2019s willingness to again single out Amazon and characterize it as a tax cheat and a job killer is a remarkable use of the presidential bully pulpit that could have serious implications for the company even without any formal moves by the federal government.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Amazon\u2019s shares are down 4 percent and are off nearly 11 percent since Axios reported on Wednesday about Mr. Trump\u2019s anger toward the company.  Context  \u2022 Amazon has said that the Postal Regulatory Commission, which oversees the service, has consistently found that its contracts with Amazon are profitable.  \u2022 The internet giant collects sales taxes on its own products in all 45 states that have one, but third-party vendors who sell products on the site often do not collect sales tax, a fact that rivals say is unfair. In addition, some municipalities complain that the company does not collect local taxes.  Critic\u2019s corner  DA Davidson analyst Tom Forte wrote in a note via Reuters:  \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s comments are consistent with industry sources we have spoken to in the shipping industry, who often label Amazon\u2019s deal with the USPS as a sweetheart deal. An argument, however, could be made that the USPS was losing billions before it expanded its service offerings for Amazon and would, still, likely lose billions if Amazon discontinued its use of the USPS tomorrow.\u201d  Intel isn\u2019t helping, either.  Shares of the chip maker are down 9 percent, their steepest decline in more than two years, after Bloomberg reported that Apple is planning to use its own chips in Mac computers beginning as early as 2020.  Citing anonymous sources, Bloomberg\u2019s Ian King and Matt Gurman report:  \u201cThe initiative, code named Kalamata, is still in the early developmental stages, but comes as part of a larger strategy to make all of Apple\u2019s devices \u2014 including Macs, iPhones, and iPads \u2014 work more similarly and seamlessly together.\u201d  Apple provides Intel with about 5 percent of its annual revenue.  Who says there are no rivalries in the hedge fund world?  Kenneth C. Griffin\u2019s Citadel has just hired Phil Villhauer, a former top trader at Steven A. Cohen\u2019s investment firm. Mr. Villhauer will become deputy head of global equities at Citadel, a newly created position. He will officially join the Chicago-based hedge fund in the middle of April and work out of Citadel\u2019s office in New York, a Citadel spokesman confirmed.  \u201cWe see this as a big hire for us,\u201d said Zia Ahmed, a Citadel spokesman.  Mr. Villhauer left Mr. Cohen\u2019s family office, Point72 Asset Management, in October after working for the billionaire investor for roughly 15 years. Mr. Villhauer had started at Mr. Cohen\u2019s former firm, SAC Capital Advisors, and most recently served as head of global trading at Point72.  The timing of Mr. Villhauer\u2019s departure came just months before Mr. Cohen was to begin managing money for outside investors.  In January, Mr. Cohen reconfigured Point72 as a hedge fund after establishing it as a family office in 2014 to manage $11 billion of his personal wealth. Point72 has said it has raised between $2 billion and $4 billion in outside money.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Mr. Villhauer had been with Mr. Cohen through both the good days and bad days. He was there when SAC turned into a powerhouse hedge fund, and he was there when the fund pleaded guilty to insider trading charges in 2013. The guilty plea required the firm to stop managing money for outside investors.  When Mr. Villhauer left Point72, Mr. Cohen, in a letter to employees, called the departure a \u201cretirement\u201d and said he was sad to see Mr. Villhauer go.  Now Mr. Villhauer will start a new chapter in his career at another well-known hedge fund firm.  ____________________________  Photo  Why Facebook\u2019s rivals have stayed mum  As Facebook lurches from crisis to crisis, other tech leaders like Marc Benioff and Tim Cook have criticized the company. But, for the most part, it\u2019s in their culture to stick together, Nick Wingfield writes.  Part of the silence, people in the industry say, comes from a desire to avoid the business equivalent of bad karma \u2014 knowing that they, too, may one day face the buzz saw of public censure.  Customers have less trouble speaking out, but those looking to punish major tech companies are finding that but boycotts are easier said than done.

Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich recently drew scrutiny for selling about $39 million worth of shares after the company learned of a major security flaw in its chips, but before the news was made public.  Intel said the sale was unrelated to security issues and was part of a prearranged annual trading plan.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Financial advisers said such considerations were left largely to the executives themselves. \u201cWe\u2019re not really in the business of talking to C.E.O.s about the public perception of what they want to do,\u201d said Scott Senseney, head of sales, marketing and communications for Fidelity\u2019s stock plan services group.  Sophisticated financial planners have myriad ways to minimize risk, beyond simply diversifying. Executives with large stock holdings can hedge their positions, minimizing downside risk. Sometimes it\u2019s possible to sell upside call options.  And in so-called exchange funds, executives from various companies will pool their stock into a fund run by an asset manager, diversifying their exposure without having to sell shares and pay any immediate capital gains taxes.  Even then, however, undue complexity can backfire. In 2012, the founder of Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, Robert Stiller, was ousted as chairman of his own company after he sold five million shares, worth about $125 million. His motivation: he had taken out loans against his sizable stake in Green Mountain, now known as Keurig Green Mountain, but when the value of the shares fell, Mr. Stiller was caught in a margin call.  The most common pitfall for executives who are rewarded with stock, however, is simply ignorance. Too often, planners say, executives don\u2019t know what they have, or what options they are entitled to. Frequently, people become aware of their options only at the last minute, or even after the fact.  \u201cThe worst-case scenario is that those options expire in the money,\u201d said Mr. Senseney. \u201cWaiting too long can be devastating. There can be millions of dollars of impact.\u201d", "stock": "TSLA"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/29/business/tesla-elon-musk.html", "label": -1, "source": "the-new-york-times", "date": "2018-03-29", "article": "Tesla shares dropped 8 percent on Tuesday and another 8 percent Wednesday, and though they regained ground Thursday, they have lost almost a quarter of their value in less than three weeks.  Reflecting questions about Tesla\u2019s ability to pay off its debt, its bonds have slumped as well. Those that will mature in 2025 traded at about 88 cents on the dollar on Thursday.  A Tesla representative declined to comment on the company\u2019s finances.  But the company\u2019s recent troubles extend beyond its balance sheet. Federal investigators are looking into a fiery crash that killed a Tesla driver last week in California, including the possibility that Autopilot was in use. (Autopilot was in use during a 2016 crash in Florida that killed a Tesla driver, but safety officials concluded that the crash did not result from a flaw in the system but found it lacked safeguards to prevent its misuse.)  And on Thursday, Tesla said it was recalling 123,000 Model S cars made before April 2016 to replace bolts that hold a power-steering motor in place. The bolts can become corroded and break, leaving drivers with only manual steering. The company said no crashes or injuries related to the issue had been reported.  Tesla\u2019s reversal of fortune is a jolt for both the company and its chief executive, who had built a reputation not only as a visionary but also as an achiever, masterminding an automotive brand, breaking ground on a battery plant that would be the world\u2019s biggest building, and launching rockets through his SpaceX venture.  For years, Tesla has ridden a wave of enthusiastic support from its customers and a certain set of investors, even though it generated barely any profit in the 15 years since its founding. Company events to present new models tend to have the feel of a religious revival, with hundreds or thousands of owners cheering wildly at each new pronouncement from Mr. Musk. Anticipation for the Model 3 prompted nearly 400,000 prospective customers to put down deposits of $1,000 each.  In November, before a screaming audience of several hundred guests, Mr. Musk unveiled a battery-powered semi truck and a two-seat roadster. He vowed to begin producing the truck by the end of 2019, even though the company does not have a factory to build it, and is still trying to work the kinks out of the Model 3 assembly process at its manufacturing plant in Fremont, Calif.

You add all that up and there\u2019s a real question about whether this company can deliver what it promises.\u201d  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  There\u2019s no doubt Tesla has achieved some breakthroughs that have left the established automakers scrambling to catch up. It has proved that there is a viable market for electric cars, and that they can command premium prices. It has pioneered methods of upgrading cars through software updates beamed over the air, the way iPhones can download new operating systems.  And it was Autopilot that set off a race to develop advanced driver-assistance systems that can guide cars under certain circumstances and actively prevent collisions \u2014 though Tesla\u2019s technology appears to have been surpassed by the self-driving systems from other companies, including G.M. and the Google spinoff Waymo.  Along the way, Mr. Musk has also courted controversy, including his move in 2016 for Tesla to take over SolarCity, a maker of home solar panels run by his cousin. A group of investors has filed a lawsuit contending that Mr. Musk had a conflict of interest because he was SolarCity\u2019s chairman, and this week a judge cleared the way for the case to go forward.  In January, Tesla gave Mr. Musk a new compensation plan tied entirely to the company\u2019s market value and other performance goals. If he hits all of the goals, he could be rewarded with stock worth more than $50 billion.  But the company has repeatedly failed to meet its own targets and deadlines, especially with the Model 3. Mr. Musk originally predicted that the Model 3 would arrive in 2017 and that the car would push the company\u2019s sales to 500,000 cars a year by 2018. He later lowered his prediction to 100,000 Model 3s in 2017. Backtracking again, he said last August that the company hoped to make 20,000 a month by December, and added that \u201cpeople should have zero concerns\u201d about Tesla\u2019s ability to increase its output of the Model 3.  But in the fourth quarter of last year, Tesla made only 2,425 Model 3s. In its most recent plan, it hopes to lift production to 2,500 Model 3s a week. The company is expected to release first-quarter production totals in early April.  The Model 3 is crucial. The company needs to ramp up its Model 3 business to generate revenue so that it can pay back investors and fund development of future vehicles including its electric truck.  Moody\u2019s concluded that Tesla probably needed to raise more than $2 billion from investors to be able to finance its operations, continue capital investment and pay debts and other financial obligations that will come due soon. According to Moody\u2019s, Tesla has $200 million in convertible bonds due later this year, and $900 million due in early 2019.  \u201cLiquidity is going to be very tight by the end of the year,\u201d Bruce Clark, a senior vice president at Moody\u2019s, said in an interview. \u201cThey need to re-establish credibility with the capital markets.\u201d", "stock": "TSLA"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/23/business/dealbook/elon-musk-tesla.html", "label": -1, "source": "the-new-york-times", "date": "2018-01-23", "article": "Who is Jay Powell: Here\u2019s a refresher.

Worth remembering: Arguably the wage raises have as much to do with tight labor markets and the desire of companies to keep existing employees or attract new ones as they do with the tax code change.  \u2014 Michael J. de la Merced  Photo  Mick Mulvaney to C.F.P.B. staff: No more envelope-pushing  From a memo that Mr. Mulvaney, who is the acting chief (or one of two, depending on whom you ask) of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, sent to the agency\u2019s staffers today:  Indeed, I think it is fair to say that the previous governing philosophy here was to aggressively \u201cpush the envelope\u201d in pursuit of the \u201cmission;\u201d that we were the \u201cgood guys\u201d and the \u201cnew sheriff in town,\u201d out to fight the \u201cbad guys.\u201d Simply put: that is what is going to be different. In fact, that entire governing philosophy of pushing the envelope frightens me a little. I would hope it would bother you as well.  And:  Writ large, I intend to exercise our statutory authority to enforce the laws of this nation. I intend to execute the statutory mandate of the Bureau to protect consumers. But we will no longer go beyond that mandate. If Congress wants us to do more than is set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act, they can change the law. Until then, we will enforce the law as currently written.  The context: Mr. Mulvaney, a longtime critic of the C.F.P.B., has been working to rein in the bureau, a longtime target of Republican ire.  \u2014 Michael J. de la Merced  Photo  Tension at the top of Airbnb  The home rental company\u2019s C.E.O., Brian Chesky, isn\u2019t always seeing eye to eye with his C.F.O., Laurence Tosi, according to an article in The Information.  In one instance, Mr. Chesky thought about starting an airline as Airbnb weighed a move into the air travel business. Mr. Tosi insisted on a lower-key approach of partnering with an existing app, according to the news site.  The context: Mr. Tosi was brought in from Blackstone to help professionalize one of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest unicorn darlings, much as Ruth Porat joined Alphabet from Morgan Stanley. That was more than likely to foster a clash between Silicon Valley idealism and Wall Street pragmatism.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  More from Cory Weinberg of The Information:  Mr. Tosi, who moved with his wife and two young children to the Bay Area for the Airbnb job, has tried to fit in, swapping Wall Street suits for jeans and vests. But his arrival also was a shock to Airbnb\u2019s culture, with its emphasis on an idealistic brand. Mr. Tosi sent marching orders across the company in 2016 that it had to get profitable. Before Airbnb could go public, it would have to have a better handle on predicting its earnings. \u201cI believe we have built this path but can do more,\u201d he wrote to employees. Mr. Tosi initiated cost-cutting efforts, including cuts to customer service and food staff, that longtime Airbnb employees saw as hurting the culture. But Airbnb\u2019s cost per customer service \u201cticket\u201d fell by 30% to 40% between 2016 and mid-2017 last year, an Airbnb official said, thanks largely to Mr. Tosi.  Why it matters: Airbnb is expected to pursue an I.P.O. as soon as next year. Which vision for the company will win out?  \u2014 Michael J. de la Merced  Was there fraud at KPMG?  The charges against five former employees of KPMG and a former government accountant show the lengths an accounting firm will go to get a good report from the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.  The indictment is a bit odd, though, because the defendants are accused of defrauding both the S.E.C. and the accounting board. They used confidential information to help deal with potential problems in KPMG\u2019s audits. But did getting a sneak peek at how they would be evaluated constitute theft, or just a form of cheating?  Fraud is a type of larceny, and normally the perpetrator obtains something from the victim, who suffers a loss. But in this case, the scheme was to help KPMG clean up its act to get a better grade in pending reviews.  In the world of white-collar crime, most fraud prosecutions involve at least some form of tangible gain to the defendants, and not a better report card. Courts have also required prosecutors to show there was at least some harm to the victim from the misuse of their property.  One way around this issue would be to charge a breach of the honest services statute, but that\u2019s not in the indictment. Nor did the Justice Department charged them under a law prohibiting the theft of government records. The S.E.C. did not accuse the accountants of securities fraud, only that they engaged in unethical or improper professional conduct.  A statement by Steven Peikin, the co-director of the S.E.C.\u2019s enforcement division, said that the defendants were \u201cliterally stealing the exam.\u201d I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s quite accurate, however, as it was more like learning when the teacher would give a pop quiz.  Is that a fraud?  \u2014 Peter J. Henning  What will Twitter do now that Anthony Noto has flown the coop?

Matt Derella, Twitter\u2019s Vice President of Global Revenue and Operations, will continue to lead the company\u2019s advertising sales efforts.

That\u2019s under a new compensation plan that Andrew reported first today. Critics, and there are many, may regard it as yet another publicity stunt by the electric car marker, which has struggled to meet production targets for its Model 3.  But Mr. Musk and the head of the Tesla board\u2019s compensation committee said the arrangement would benefit shareholders, since it\u2019s directly linked to company performance.  Here\u2019s what Mr. Musk told Andrew:  \u201cIf all that happens over the next 10 years is that Tesla\u2019s value grows by 80 or 90 percent, then my amount of compensation would be zero,\u201d he said. (His calculations were based on the stock price at the beginning of this year, when the company was worth about $50 billion.)  Trivia: California law requires that Tesla pay Mr. Musk minimum wage, even though he doesn\u2019t want a salary. So it cuts him a check for a little over $37,000 each year, which he never cashes.

Putting the Model 3 into mass production is a critical task for Tesla. The company has taken $1,000 deposits from about 400,000 customers interested in buying the car. If it can begin producing the car rapidly, its sales and revenue will soar and it could vault into profitability.  Just two years ago, Mr. Musk hoped to make 500,000 by 2018, and the ambitious forecast helped push Tesla\u2019s market value above that of General Motors and Ford Motor for a period in 2017.  In July, as Model 3 production was about to begin, Mr. Musk ratcheted back expectations, resetting his target to 20,000 vehicles a month by December. But difficulties producing battery packs at Tesla\u2019s Nevada plant, called the Gigafactory, and other glitches in the car\u2019s assembly process combined to slow output to a crawl.  Tesla built just 260 by the end of September. In January, it said it had made only 2,425 in the final quarter of 2017, and set a goal of increasing output to 5,000 a month by the end of the first quarter.  Mr. Musk said Tesla had developed a new automated production line that would be installed in the Gigafactory in March, easing hitches in supplying batteries to its assembly plant in Fremont, Calif., which was once operated jointly by Toyota Motor and General Motors.

When investors don\u2019t put any more money into the company, then you will know it\u2019s a problem.\u201d  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  On a positive note, Tesla reported it used up only $277 million in cash in the fourth quarter. That was down from $1.4 billion in the third quarter. On a full-year basis, however, the company used nearly $3.5 billion in cash, more than twice the amount from 2016.  The company\u2019s loss in the quarter amounted to $3.04 per share on an adjusted basis, slightly less than analysts had forecast, and $4.01 unadjusted.  Tesla has lost money in eight of the last nine quarters. Mr. Musk said he was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d that it would begin to generate net income in 2018, as Model 3 production and deliveries rose.  The company\u2019s shares were little changed in extended trading after the earnings report. They had risen 3.3 percent during the regular session.  Even if Model 3 output rises, Tesla will have to spend heavily on two future vehicles \u2014 a battery-powered semi truck and another car, the Model Y.  While working on the Model 3, Mr. Musk has continued to seek new barriers to break in other areas.  On Tuesday, his other company, SpaceX, successfully launched a heavy rocket into space. It was the first time a rocket that powerful had been launched by a private company. The Falcon Heavy is carrying a cherry-red Tesla Roadster. The rocket and the car are intended to go into an orbit around the sun, where they could remain for hundreds of millions of years.  \u201cIf we can send a Roadster to the asteroid belt,\u201d Mr. Musk said Wednesday, \u201cI think we can solve Model 3 production.\u201d", "stock": "TSLA"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/06/business/porsche-mission-e-tesla.html", "label": -1, "source": "the-new-york-times", "date": "2018-03-06", "article": "\u201cOne of our priorities will be to equip our 189 dealerships with 800-volt DC fast chargers,\u201d said Klaus Zellmer, president and chief executive of Porsche Cars North America. \u201cWe have just installed six at our Porsche Experience centers in Atlanta and will roll them out at our experience center in Los Angeles, too.\u201d  As part of its settlement with the California Air Resources Board and the United States Environmental Protection Agency over its diesel emission test cheating, Volkswagen, Porsche\u2019s parent company, is also building a network of 2,800 DC fast chargers by June 2019.  Photo  The Cross Turismo introduced on Tuesday is part of the other half of this two-pronged approach. Although it is officially a concept vehicle, it is expected to be an accurate preview of what buyers will see from Porsche after the Mission E vehicles go into production next year. While no pricing has been announced, the sedan version could run close to the existing Panamera, which begins at $85,000, compared with the $74,500 base price of a Tesla Model S 75D.  The Mission E vehicles are hardly alone in jockeying for position in the premium electric market. Last week, Jaguar unveiled the production version of its fully electric I-Pace crossover, which is scheduled to glide into showrooms in the second half of 2018. The Jaguar I-Pace, the carmaker\u2019s first electric vehicle, will start at $69,500 in the United States; a Tesla Model X starts at $79,500.  Audi has announced it will ship its e-tron quattro to European showrooms this fall and to the United States in early 2019. And Volvo plans an all-electric version of its XC40 crossover in 2019.  Porsche, Jaguar, Audi and other long-established carmakers have watched as Tesla has sprinted ahead, but Tesla will soon lose one crucial benefit that the later arrivals may be able to use to close the gap: tax benefits. At some point this year, Tesla will produce its 200,000th car. (General Motors, which makes the Chevrolet Bolt EV and Volt electric vehicles, will most likely reach that mark in 2018, too.) At that milestone, federal tax credits will begin to phase out.  It\u2019s not clear whether the new upscale choices will hurt Tesla or simply expand the segment. Dave Guilford, a managing editor for Crain\u2019s Automotive News, suggested that \u201cit\u2019s probably a little bit of both.\u201d  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  \u201cYou could see when Porsche unveiled the Mission E it was aiming right at Tesla,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful car. New entries in the premium segment give it credibility.\u201d  The wagonlike all-wheel-drive Cross Turismo could be a compelling alternative to the Model X. Its 440-kilowatt system uses two permanent synchronous electric motors and a floor-mounted lithium-ion battery pack that Porsche claims will propel the Cross Turismo to 60 miles per hour in 3.5 seconds. It will also employ an air suspension that can add nearly two inches of ground clearance and rear-wheel steering that will help it in the corners. At 15 feet long, the Cross Turismo concept is about four inches shorter than the company\u2019s Macan crossover and 18 inches shorter than a Tesla Model X.  The concept\u2019s interior features a free-standing instrument cluster screen with three circular display graphics. A camera with eye-tracking ability recognizes which graphic the driver is looking at and moves it forward while reducing the size of the others. Porsche executives suggested that the technology was being considered for the production car.

For example, when a Tesla is put into Ludicrous Mode, drivers are warned of the possibility of \u201caccelerated wear of the motor, gearbox and battery.\u201d And Teslas will sometimes enter a reduced-power mode under track conditions in order to protect the battery from overheating.  Porsche intends to avoid such limitations, said Albrecht Reimold, a member of the Porsche executive board for production.

There have also been quality issues; Consumer Reports ranked the Model X among the 10 least-reliable vehicles in its survey, and there have been well-documented fit and finish problems.  That has provided an opening not just for the luxury carmakers, but for the rest of the industry to join General Motors and Nissan, which makes the Leaf electric vehicle, in challenging Tesla\u2019s Model 3. Hyundai, for example, has confirmed plans for a fully electric Kona crossover, and Buick is rumored to be gaining a small crossover based on the Chevy Bolt platform.

It is also facing an investor lawsuit related to Tesla\u2019s acquisition of SolarCity, a solar-panel maker where Mr. Musk was serving as chairman. Meanwhile, competition is mounting from other luxury car makers that have developed their own electric cars, while Waymo, the Google spinoff, General Motors and others seem to have passed Tesla in self-driving technology.  \u201cThere\u2019s a lot going on that undermines Elon\u2019s credibility right now,\u201d said Karl Brauer, a senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book.

It can steer, brake and accelerate automatically with little input from the driver. Tesla readily points out that Autopilot \u2014 despite the implications in its name \u2014 is only a driver-assistance system and is not intended to pilot cars on its own.  Drivers are given warnings on the dashboard and in the owner\u2019s manual to remain engaged and alert while using it. Tesla originally described it as a \u201cbeta\u201d version, a term that usually refers to software still in the developmental stage.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  At the time of the Florida crash, it was possible to engage Autopilot and cruise on highways for several minutes without the driver holding the steering wheel. In that crash, the Autopilot\u2019s camera, then the primary sensor in the system, failed to recognize a white truck as it was crossing a rural highway. Tesla said the camera was confused because the truck appeared against a bright sky.  Software modifications introduced that fall included more frequent warnings to drivers to keep their hands on the steering wheel. After three warnings, the new software prevents Autopilot from operating until the driver stops, turns off the car and restarts.  The new version also made radar the primary sensor, and Mr. Musk said the new radar would have been able to see the truck in the Florida crash despite the bright sky.  Autopilot does not use lidar \u2014 a kind of radar based on lasers \u2014 that Waymo and others have maintained are crucial for fully autonomous vehicles. Mr. Musk has said he believes lidar is not necessary for Autopilot to be safe.  At least three people have now died while driving with Autopilot engaged. In January 2017, a Chinese owner was at the wheel of a Model S when the car crashed into a road sweeper on a highway.  The National Transportation Safety Board is now investigating the March 23 crash that killed Mr. Huang. Its investigation of the 2016 Florida accident concluded that Autopilot \u201cplayed a major role,\u201d and said that it lacked safeguards to prevent misuse by drivers.  An earlier investigation, by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration, said that the company\u2019s Autopilot-enabled vehicles did not need to be recalled. That inquiry, however, focused only on the question of whether any flaws in the system had led to the crash; it found no such flaws.", "stock": "TSLA"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/05/business/tesla-model-3.html", "label": 0, "source": "the-new-york-times", "date": "2018-04-05", "article": "Despite this wave of negative publicity, it seems clear that Tesla will rise or fall based on the performance, safety, design and value of its cars. If it gets those things right, all the other issues will sort themselves out. Tesla has already defied skeptics and attracted legions of die-hard fans by surmounting seemingly impossible odds to build all-electric cars that have drawn lavish praise from automotive critics.  That includes the Model 3, which Popular Mechanics named its 2018 Car of the Year. (It was a finalist for Motor Trend\u2019s similar award. That it lost out to the Alfa Romeo Giulia has drawn howls of online protest.)  When my Model 3 test vehicle pulled up to the curb on Eighth Avenue, it didn\u2019t quite stop pedestrian traffic the way opening the gull-wing doors on the Model X had, but I could see why the automotive press is so excited. The interior features a single slab of wood sweeping around the cockpit interrupted only by a touch-screen interface that houses nearly all the controls, many of them voice activated.  With its Zen minimalism, it doesn\u2019t look or feel like any other car I\u2019ve been in. The synthetic-leather seats are comfortable, and there\u2019s ample room for someone my size (6-foot-3). This all comes at a cost: $57,500 for this luxurious long-range version, far from the $35,000 base price that has excited many potential Tesla buyers.  The Model 3 may not have the rocketlike acceleration of the X, but I found it nimble and responsive. I easily accelerated from a full stop into traffic flowing at highway speed, usually a nerve-racking maneuver in a conventional car. Driving the Model 3 was such a pleasure I was reluctant to cede any control to Autopilot.  For someone with decades of experience driving a conventional car, my first taste of semiautonomous driving last fall had come as a shock. The sensation of a vehicle moving on its own was so bizarre that I instinctively gripped the steering wheel, which immediately transferred control back to me.  This time I was more relaxed, willing to see how the car would behave. I gave the voice-activated navigation system a destination (Garden State Plaza, a New Jersey shopping mall about 20 miles away), and the car accelerated, braked, stayed in the center of the lane and maintained a comfortable three-car distance ahead of me, all without my intervention. At the mall, it detected an empty parking place, and flawlessly backed into it.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  One of its most impressive features is the ability for the driver to change lanes simply by pressing the turn-signal lever.

Although I\u2019d been briefed on its limitations, so successful was Autopilot that I was tempted to let down my guard by not bothering to look in the rearview mirror. That would have been a mistake.  For all its vision capabilities (including in darkness), Autopilot became confused when lanes weren\u2019t clearly marked or split in two or at exit ramps. You can\u2019t simply program the destination and let the car find its way. It\u2019s reassuringly cautious about changing lanes, but in heavy traffic, I would have missed an exit while waiting for it to find a suitable opening, and had to assert manual control.  While heading south on the New Jersey Turnpike, I could see in the rearview mirror a BMW bearing down at high speed. I pushed the turn signal for a lane change, and despite its ultrasonic sensors, the Tesla seemed oblivious to the onrushing car. It started to move into its lane; the driver laid on his horn, and I had to grab control to avoid an accident.  Blog posts indicate that other drivers have experienced the same issue.  The Tesla owner\u2019s manual describes this situation as one that the system can\u2019t yet manage. Tesla said it expected future upgrades to solve the problem, but for now, drivers need to be as attentive to the rearview mirror as with any other car.  Tesla had no comment for this column.  At this juncture, Autopilot is a misnomer, as many others have observed. \u201cThis is not self-driving technology,\u201d said Bryan Reimer, a research scientist and expert on autonomous vehicle technology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cIt\u2019s a collaborative system that leaves responsibility for safety in the drivers\u2019 hands and isn\u2019t intended to let them sit in the back seat or pursue other activities while driving.\u201d Even though some companies have said they plan driverless ride services in as little as two years, Mr. Reimer said full automation was likely to be many years or even decades in the future.  Self-driving automation systems are ranked from zero (no automation) to 5 (full automation). Tesla\u2019s Autopilot is Level 2. It requires drivers to keep at least one hand on the wheel. The car issues a prompt if it doesn\u2019t detect a hand on the wheel, and Autopilot shuts down if there\u2019s no response. In the Mountain View accident, Tesla has said, the driver \u201creceived several visual and one audible hands-on warning,\u201d but \u201cthe driver\u2019s hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds prior to the collision.\u201d  Given that this was my first extended drive using Autopilot, I was hypervigilant, maybe even more so than in a conventional car. I\u2019m told that wears off in time, as using Autopilot becomes second nature. The risk is that complacency contributes to driver inattention. Mr. Reimer and other experts are conducting research into the issue.  \u201cAs technology supplants human performance,\u201d Mr. Reimer said, \u201cthe bigger question is how safe is safe enough. If lane-changing technology is 50 percent more effective than humans, is that good enough? That\u2019s the big question no one wants to answer.\u201d  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  At the same time, he said, he worries that \u201cintense media coverage of accidents like Mountain View will scare people off.\u201d He said it was too soon to draw any conclusions from that fatality, but noted that Tesla\u2019s excellent safety record over the many millions of miles its cars have now traveled suggested that using Autopilot \u201ccan\u2019t be substantially more risky than conventional controls.\u201d (There were more than 40,000 traffic fatalities in the United States last year.)  After investigating a fatal 2016 crash involving a Tesla S and a tractor-trailer in Florida, the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration found no flaws in the Autopilot system. The National Transportation Safety Board concluded that Autopilot had performed as intended, but that the driver had become overly reliant on the technology.  After my drive in the Model 3, my sense is that even with its flaws, Tesla\u2019s Autopilot is a vast improvement over conventional controls, and enhances (rather than supplants) the driving experience. I\u2019m tempted to join the Model 3 waiting list, which numbers over 400,000 customers.  Investors, too, seem to have reassessed Tesla\u2019s recent bad news. This past week, Tesla said it had succeeded in ramping up production of the Model 3, though it still fell short of targets, and had adequate capital for the rest of the year.

The thought of never having to fill up your car at a gas station may sound like a dream, but it\u2019s very much a reality that plenty of Tesla owners enjoy already.  Unlike a hybrid, Tesla is an electric vehicle that will need to be charged up in order to be driven. While a Hybrid vehicle can operate on battery power for a short period, it primarily still requires regular petrol to operate on the roads.  Charging infrastructure is still very much in its infancy in the UAE, it\u2019s only set to grow in the coming years, as more and more people start to embrace electric vehicles.  So if you\u2019ve got some burning questions about Tesla, here\u2019s a handy guide to everything you\u2019ll need to know about owning a Tesla in Dubai.  Does it really not need any fuel? How much would I save in fuel costs?  That\u2019s right \u2013 you\u2019ll never need to put a drop of petrol in your Tesla. It has practically zero emissions, and runs 100% off battery power. What\u2019s more, the front space where you\u2019d normally find a car engine is now replaced by a front trunk, so you get extra storage space for your things.  For a single charge at home, you would pay approximate AED 23 for a full charge. Compare that with about AED 160 for a full tank for a Mercedes E-Class E350 Sedan 3.5L, 2017 model for approximately the same range, and you can see how much you can save in a month.  Charging: How do I charge a Tesla, where do I charge it and how long does it take to charge?  There are three main ways to charge a Tesla:  Standard Wall Charger: This comes with any Tesla car, and allows you to plug your car into any standard 3-pin socket and recharge it. This is also the slowest way to recharge your Tesla.  Destination Charger: These chargers are available at places like certain hotels or shopping malls. They charge your Tesla much faster than a Standard Wall Charger, and will add about 100km of distance with a single hour of charge. You can also get a special home version of the Destination Charger installed for your personal use for around AED 2,000.  Supercharger: This is the fastest way to charge your Tesla, with a full charge taking a little under an hour. Superchargers are generally installed at the borders of most cities, and are designed so that on long journeys your Tesla has enough charge to get from one Supercharger to another.  Destination charging stations are available at most shopping malls in Dubai and in Abu Dhabi. There is one Supercharger available in Masdar City in Abu Dhabi, and one available at Last Exit at Jebel Ali in Dubai.  Assuming a 100 kWh battery with 565km of mileage, a Standard Wall Charger would take about 22 hours, a Destination Charger would take about 5 hours, and a Supercharger would take about 72 minutes.  Charging at a Destination Charger is completely free. Each year, owners receive 400 kWh of free Supercharger credit, enough to drive about 1600 km \u2013 any charging above this is charged at a nominal fee. For charging at home, you\u2019ll incur any charges to your normal electricity bill, but these again will be much cheaper than filling your car with petrol.  How far can I drive on a full charge and what happens if I run out of charge?  A 100D Model S is quoted as having about 594km of range on a full charge. However, this is purely on paper \u2013 this distance is dramatically reduced when you take into account the outside temperature and what speed the air conditioning is on. With an outside temperature of 40C and the air conditioning running at a medium speed, you\u2019ll get about 548km of range on a full charge.  Just like with a normal car that runs out of petrol, you\u2019ll have to call a service truck and get your car towed. The only difference is that you\u2019ll have to get it towed to a nearby charger, rather than a gas station.  Lets talk numbers: How much does a Tesla cost and what about insurance and maintenance?  A Tesla Model S starts from around AED 270,000, while the Model X starts from around AED 330,000. These are base model prices, which will obviously increase as you customize or add more features to your car.  With regards to insurance, according to Jonathan Rawling, CFO, of compareit4me, \u201cFor the Model S, based on its value and power, we\u2019d estimate that a fully comprehensive insurance policy would cost between AED 8,000 and AED 12,000 for the Model X. However, that number could vary wildly depending on the primary driver\u2019s age, nationality and no-claims record. The spare parts issue would also come into play, too.\u201d  These approximate insurance costs are on par with say a Mercedes E-Class E350 Sedan 3.5L, 2017 model.  At the moment service costs aren\u2019t quite apparent as Tesla is only just launching, but given that there are less moving parts in a Tesla than a standard car engine, we\u2019d expect services to be less frequent and be less expensive. A Tesla\u2019s battery lasts around ten years before needing to be replaced, which in theory would be the only major part that you\u2019d replace.  Does the Autopilot feature work in Dubai?  To some extent, yes. When driving long distances you\u2019ll be able to switch on Autopilot to have the car stay within your lane and maintain a safe distance from the car in front of you. It\u2019s a system that is still under testing in the UAE, so there will be some restrictions in place and Tesla has already warned that drivers are still expected to keep their hands on the wheel and stay alert at all times.

The problem affects cars made before April 2016 and is particularly likely to happen in colder climates where calcium or magnesium road salt is used. However, no accidents or injuries have been recorded in connection with the defect, Tesla says \u2013 this is a proactive move designed to stop the defect from developing.  \"If the bolts fail, the driver is still able to steer the car, but increased force is required due to loss or reduction of power assist,\" says Tesla. \"This primarily makes the car harder to drive at low speeds and for parallel parking, but does not materially affect control at high speed, where only small steering wheel force is needed.\"  Bad timing  If your Model S is affected and you have been sent an email, Tesla says you're still okay to carry on driving \u2013 just make sure you schedule an appointment with a local Tesla garage.

More than a year since the I-Pace Concept was unveiled, the British car manufacturer has now launched its first full-electric car.  It slides into the SUV (Sports Utility Vehicle) category, which means it'll be going head-to-head with the Tesla Model X.  It's not quite a big as the Model X, with the new Jaguar offering seats for up to five adults, while the Tesla can go to seven seats.  What you do get though is a 90kWh battery capable of delivering up to 298 miles per charge - although the likelihood is it'll be a little less in real life unless your driving is textbook economical.  Jaguar also says the I-Pace will be able to do 0-60mph in 4.5 seconds, ensuring that it has enough punch from the get-go. It's not quite as brisk as Tesla's 0-60 in 2.9 seconds Ludicrous Mode - but that is a pricey optional extra.  In terms of charging, from 50kW chargers you'll be able to replenish from 0% to 80% in 85 minutes, while a 30 minute charge will be good for around 80 miles of travel. It is also compatible with the 100kW fast chargers, allowing you top up even quicker with the 0% to 80% time slashed to 40 minutes.  Charging at home over a standard 7kW wall box connection will be much slower, with ten hours required to achieve an 85% top up from empty - which is fine for overnight.  Alexa, is my car locked?  Jaguar is also launching an Amazon Alexa skill for the I-Pace, which will allow you to ask your smart home assistant various questions about the car.  Examples include 'is my car locked?', 'what is the charging level?' and 'do I have enough range to get to work?'  The I-Pace is the first Jaguar to offer over-the-air software updates - a service Tesla already offers for all its models - ensuring the car has also the latest patches, fixes and features.  The Jaguar I-Pace isn't cheap, with prices starting at \u00a363,495 (around $87,000, AU$110,000), but the Model X is a touch pricier.

But now Musk is Tweeting about his high-speed transportation project Hyperloop. You know the one \u2013 the vacuum tube, levitating pod, very Jetsons idea.  So far Hyperloop has fallen pretty far short of Musk\u2019s promise of speeds of over 700 miles per hour, with the record being held by Virgin Hyperloop One at 240mph from a speed test in December 2017.

That\u2019s what happened recently after testing a 2018 Cadillac CT6 sedan for a week, driving along a highway during a morning commute and then all the way across an entire state for about three hours, all without using the steering wheel.  Cadillac first announced Super Cruise several years ago, and it was a shot across the bow for competitors like Tesla, Mercedes-Benz and Audi \u2013 companies that are all working on similar tech.  Tesla made the most progress until a fatal accident in 2016 . Before then, it was possible to drive for long periods of time without touching the steering wheel. An update now forces drivers to hand-check to make sure they are paying attention. (Tesla owners have figured out though that they can wedge an orange or a water bottle in the steering wheel to trick the system.)  (Credit: Cadillac)  With Super Cruise, the system goes well beyond the on-board sensors that keep you centered in your lane.  Cadillac mapped out 130,000 miles of highways in the US, but in order for the system to work, you must be on a road that has a barrier between lanes, is a four-lane highway, and entrance and exit ramps (usually with an overpass).  In our tests, we noticed Super Cruise would only activate after driving on a highway that meets those criteria after a minute or so, then disable itself a few minutes before we entered a stretch of road that didn\u2019t meet the criteria.  \u201cOne of the benefits of Super Cruise is to reduce driver fatigue during highway commutes \u2013 especially during heavy congestion on every day commuting and on long distance trips,\u201d says Daryl Wilson, the Lead Development Engineer for Super Cruise. \u201cSuper Cruise combines information from five cameras with a high-definition LIDAR-scanned map database and real-time corrected precision GPS to provide a robust path for the vehicle to follow.\u201d  (Credit: Cadillac)  During one test, a small gray icon appeared to the right of the main speedometer display indicating that Super Cruise was available.  We then pressed the Super Cruise button to activate it, and took our hands off the wheel. It\u2019s a slick, intelligent new technology that helped with the tedium of driving \u2013 you can relax a little more.  You still have to stay alert, but without your hands on the wheel, you can rest your arms and let the car drive itself.  The CT6 drove perfectly during each hands-free test, although there are a few things that are unique to the autonomous mode compared to driving a Tesla Model S.  One is that the lights on the steering wheel help you drive (or, rather, not drive). Green means Super Cruise is activated, red means there\u2019s a warning, and blue means it\u2019s paused.  If you want to change lanes, you activate the turn signal, then wait for the blue light to appear. This tells you that Super Cruise is pausing while you change lanes. Once you do, you wait for the light to glow blue so Super Cruise can resume. It takes some practice, honestly, but it makes sense why it works that way.  Secondly, Super Cruise is constantly monitoring whether you are paying attention; a camera points directly at you from the steering column.  In one drive, turning to look at a passenger for too long caused the system to deactivate. The lights started flashing, and we had to place our hands on the wheel after a few seconds.  In another test, turning to look to the side of the car caused the system to deactivate again. This time, the system flashed but, because we didn\u2019t grab the wheel, it locked the system and made Super Cruise unavailable. (To use it again, you have to pull over, turn the car off for a few seconds, then start the engine again.)  These precautions also make sense. It\u2019s a smart way to allow the driver to go hands-free for even several hours, monitoring attention level the whole time. And, it worked.  Other lane-keeping technologies, autonomous driving modes, and start and stop adaptive cruise systems sometimes feel wonky, as though a computer is in control.  Super Cruise feels natural. Some vehicles \u2013 like the Chrysler 200 \u2013 have somewhat similar tech, but the car feels like it\u2019s moving around and adjusting itself to stay in the lane. The CT6 stayed perfectly centered.  What\u2019s next from here? I imagine Cadillac will map out more highways and even release a patch at some point for two-lane highways and then, eventually, side streets and downtown areas.  A Cadillac representative did not confirm any other plans for additional Cadillac models to use Super Cruise, but autonomous driving will become more and more common.  Google's Waymo already uses autonomous minivans, and is picking up early riders with no driver behind the wheel. However, wider adoption of fully self-driving technology is still a ways off. For now, Super Cruise is a smart system that worked well during our entire testing period.", "stock": "TSLA"}, {"url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/2018-mercedes-benz-e400-reads-and-reacts-to-speed-limit-signs-on-the-fly", "label": -1, "source": "techradar", "date": "2018-03-15", "article": "Image credit: Mercedes Benz  On the road to fully autonomous driving, there are a few milestones that give us some hope. Cars like the Volvo S90 that can adjust speed for the car in front of you on the highway and a Tesla Model S that can go hands-free for short periods have already set the bar.  This year, Cadillac challenged the Tesla throne with Super Cruise, a feature on the 2018 Cadillac CT6 that lets you drive without touching the steering wheel, even for several hours.  Another milestone? A feature on the 2018 Mercedes Benz E400 called Active Speed Limit Assist.  It\u2019s not brand new, and you can find it on other Mercedes models like the S-Class and several BMW models, but it\u2019s a sign of things to come \u2013 adaptive intelligence, machine learning, image recognition, and real-time mapping on major highways.  2018 Mercedes Benz E400 reads road signs and adjusts accordingly (Credit: Mercedes Benz)  As you drive, the E400 will adjust the speed you are driving to match the post limit. (You have to enable the feature in the main display; to activate, just use cruise control.)  It\u2019s an exciting innovation for a few reasons. One is that you don\u2019t have to think about the speed limit (say what you will at this point about going 5 mph over the limit, which many drivers feel is an acceptable risk).  You can pay attention to other things, like the sports-car on your bumper. Of course, you should always be aware of your speed.  More than anything, it shows how cars are becoming more aware of the roadway, the posted limits, and eventually could sense imminent dangers long before you see them yourself.  With Active Speed Limit Assist, it feels like an AI has taken over (Credit: Mercedes Benz)  In testing it, there\u2019s a feeling that an AI has taken over, one that adjusts automatically. On a four-lane highway, the E400 surged gently forward at times before we even realized the limit had changed.  This can help in situations where you are driving slowly and don\u2019t realize why everyone is looking at you. In one case, a jump from an area with stoplights with a speed limit of only 55 mph suddenly changed over to 70 mph.  Road awareness  Mercedes doesn\u2019t do the abrupt speed change common on other vehicles that finally have adaptive cruise control, like the 2018 Toyota Prius Prime . Instead, it\u2019s gradual.  During a longer test outside of a major city, there were times when we forgot the E400 was even changing speeds. It\u2019s easy to see how future cars will also read conditions like construction zones, icy pavement, an accident, and other problems reported either to traffic centers or that the car can identify.  Still, Active Speed Limit Assist isn\u2019t perfect. It worked for us only at normal highways speeds; in a traffic jam on a lonely country road with poor lane markings, it wasn\u2019t available.  Another specification to consider? The optional Premium 3 package adds $10,200 (about \u00a37,320 / AU$13,080) to the $58,900 (about \u00a342,274 / AU$75,538) base price.

We\u2019ll have to wait a little while longer for a GeForce announcement.  However, the way things are shaping up, we wouldn\u2019t expect to see Volta-powered GTX cards any time soon, as the architecture seems to be almost purely built around AI use-cases. And, even if Nvidia may be biding its time due to pricing and VRAM shortages, Turing is the architecture that we believe will be the real GeForce GTX 11 series.  Eager for an upgrade?

It's not a consumer-level device by any stretch of the imagination.    On the other hand, the Nvidia Titan V \u2013 released in December 2017 \u2013 is considered a consumer device, but you might scoff at the $2,999 (about \u00a32149, AU$3800) price point. The Titan V is targeted towards researchers and other high-performance computing needs rather than making PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds look pretty.    But if you are looking for a new graphics card, will you be able to buy a fresh, top-of-the-line GeForce GTX 1180 soon? Honestly, we're not sure. The GTX 10-series line was announced back in May 2016 and began rolling out that month, so we're nearing the two-year mark since Nvidia's Pascal-powered cards first released. But they're still selling like crazy, especially with the current cryptocurrency craze leading to gouged prices and scarce availability.    Furthermore, Nvidia head Jensen Huang suggested last August that it's still too costly to produce consumer-level gaming graphics cards at reasonable prices. Given that we didn't see any GeForce announcements at CES 2018 in January, and since the Titan V just recently rolled out at that eye-popping price, it seems entirely possible that Nvidia isn't going to rush out Volta-powered gaming GPUs anytime soon.    We expect to see them in 2018, but our original expectation of a spring debut doesn't seem terribly firm, and there aren't enough solid rumors or leaks to point to at this time.  Nvidia Volta price  Without a roadmap for releases, we can't say for sure what to expect from pricing for Volta-powered GeForce GTX graphics cards. The Titan V's pumped-up pricing shouldn't scare you, as the card was never intended for gamers. On the other hand, if Volta-powered GPUs were still too pricey to produce for graphics cards a few months ago, how long will it take until they hit a point where Nvidia deems them worth selling?  Until then, we can look back at the base price points for the current 10-series line, although you might find much higher prices due to the cryptocurrency boom.  We'll have to wait and see whether Nvidia releases a similar range of Volta-based cards, as well as whether they'll see any significant price increase from the 10-series starting points.  Given that the prices of Nvidia Pascal graphics cards came at a slightly higher premium \u2013 coinciding with the increased performance \u2013 over the Maxwell cards they replaced, we can imagine that these 11-series parts could be more expensive.  Nvidia Volta specs  Volta introduces a new 12-nanometer manufacturing process, which marks a significant step up from the 16nm process seen with the Pascal GPUs.  What exactly does that mean?  Well, it means that Nvidia's manufacturing partner TSMC can jam a whole lot more transistors into a comparable amount of space, thus yielding a massive surge in computing ability. You'll get better performance, not to mention significant power savings.  The Titan V packs in 21.1 billion transistors, which collectively provide a stunning 110 teraflops of computing power. New tensor cores are designed to speed up deep learning ability, with nine times more peak computing teraflops over the previous Titan Xp card. And it's twice as energy-efficient too.  Additionally, the Titan V has six graphics processing clusters with 5,120 CUDA cores (up from 3,840 in the Titan Xp) and 320 texture units, and a base clock of 1200MHz that can boost up to 1455MHz. With 12GB HBM2 memory onboard, the Titan V boasts a memory bandwidth of 652.8GB/sec.  The last bit on the specs side is surprising from Nvidia, whom just the last year championed the enhanced speed of GDDR5X memory on its high-end GPUs.  The Nvidia Titan V is the first mainline card to feature high-bandwidth memory outside of the company\u2019s Quadro and Tesla parts. Whether this means HBM2 will be a mainstay of Volta remains to be seen.  All told, it's a potentially enormous upgrade over the last generation of Nvidia cards.  But let's step back for a moment, because all we can do right now is compare a $2,999 graphics card to the $1,200 card that came before it\u2014and neither of those figures gives us a whole lot of insight into what we'll actually see from the cheaper GeForce cards that ultimately come our way. We'll likely get scaled-down versions of the Nvidia Titan V at lower prices, so they may not hit the same kinds of peaks as their progenitor is capable of.  Even so, however, the promise of dramatically increased performance on the top end suggests that we'll see similar kinds of improvements at the more approachable price points. And if so, then the GTX 11-series really should provide dramatic boosts in graphical output. On the high end, we should get 4K gaming nearer to the sweet spot of 60 frames per second, while cheaper versions should be more capable of smooth VR performance and strongly support resolutions in excess of 1080p.  Until Nvidia releases a roadmap for its GeForce GTX offerings and hints at what form those cards will take, we're still spit-balling for now.  But based on these initial pro-level renditions, Volta seems capable of so much more than the previous Pascal-powered GPUs \u2013 and even if those are plenty powerful today, Volta appears poised to elevate PC gaming to previously unseen levels.

Just know that, while these incredible visuals were rendered in real time, they cost at least $60,000 to make.  Epic Games detailed the technology behind its awesome demonstration (seen below) in a blog post, name-dropping Nvidia and Disney\u2019s Industrial Light and Magic xLAB as collaborators on the project, with Nvidia\u2019s contribution being one of its $60,000 DGX Station computers.  These high-end workstation computers are equipped with a whopping four Nvidia Tesla V100 graphics cards (with a total of 64GB of video memory), a 20-core Intel Xeon processor, several terabytes of storage and an insane 256GB of DDR4 memory \u2013 all drawing up to 1,500 watts of power.  Ray tracing: a bit more far flung of a future?  Ray tracing is a hyper-realistic, dynamic lighting technology that has long existed in the realm of computer-generated film-making, where visuals are rendered once and then become a simple video file. For this tech to finally be on the horizon for video games \u2013 all of which have to render their visuals in real-time as the game is played, all of the time \u2013 is incredibly exciting.  However, beyond the fact that this feature will be exclusive to Nvidia graphics cards on its Volta architecture and whatever comes after (all of which expected to be mighty pricey even for consumers), graphics of the level you see above will almost certainly not be possible with the consumer-grade, ray-tracing graphics cards that Nvidia releases this year.  It\u2019s refreshing to see Epic be so transparent about the work and tech behind its amazing demonstration \u2013 seriously, that video looks like it\u2019s ripped from the film.  But, it\u2019s important to not only give the supporting cast credit where it\u2019s due, but to intimate that the level of computing power required to generate these visuals simply isn\u2019t within sight of the vast majority of PC gamers, namely when advertising shiny new technology to hopeful consumers.

But Uber Freight and Uber\u2019s Advanced Technology Group (UberATG) have come up with a cool system of shipping goods across the country, while keeping self-driving trucks on the freeway, where UberATG\u2019s AI is most specialized.  In this video, an LA truck driver named Mike heads east to a rest stop in Topock, Arizona, where he meets an Uber trucker named Larry delivering freight from the Midwest. The two truckers park next to each other, disconnect from their trailers, and reconnect to each others\u2019 trailers.  Mike takes the new goods back to his California warehouse \u2014 a four-hour trip instead of days to and from the Midwest \u2014 while the self-driving truck takes the LA-based shipment to its next destination. (For now, Larry engages semiautonomous mode.)  Arizona has been Uber\u2019s self-driving testing ground for a couple of years now, but Uber Freight\u2019s video shows that the company has officially incorporated self-driving trucks into its business \u2014even if they can\u2019t officially use the self-driving tech outside of Arizona.  UberATG\u2019s tech for automating trucks comes from Otto , the self-driving startup they purchased in 2016; Waymo, Google\u2019s self-driving rival, ended up settling a lawsuit with Uber over the purchase, claiming Otto\u2019s ex-Google employees had taken Waymo\u2019s AI technology with them.  Making trucking jobs more appealing  In theory, workers like taxi drivers or pizza deliverers could lose their jobs to AI tech. But Uber\u2019s self-driving trucks would complete jobs that, as NPR reported, no one wants anymore.  The average age for truckers is 55, ostensibly because younger people aren\u2019t attracted to the low wages and long hours away from home. And, according to projections, the need for truckers and cross-country deliveries is only going to increase.  Uber Advanced Technology Group's projections for how self-driving trucks could take on freight payloads without cutting into the job market (Image: \u00a9 Uber)  But, if Uber has its way, truckers wouldn\u2019t need to travel that far from home. In a recent blog post , UberATG described its vision for similar transfer hubs \u201cplaced strategically across the country near cities and towns, bridging the gap between local and long haul trucking.\u201d  Similar to how companies like Amazon keep warehouses strategically close to population centers, Uber would set up transfer points equidistant to as many major cities as possible, and limit the distance that truckers would have to drive to pick up freight. They\u2019d still have to be qualified for a difficult job, but their hours would be much less draining and unhealthy.

In the US, there is one automotive fatality every 86 million miles across all vehicles from all manufacturers.

It doesn't have the neck-snapping speed of Ludicrous mode, but the Long Range version's 307 pounds of torque coupled with 271 horsepower make for a car that's just asking the driver to punch the accelerator and hit a few curves.  The Model 3 also has a very smooth and nearly silent ride. It's quieter than most other EVs, and it glides almost as well as a mid-tier luxury sedan. With a range of 220 miles for the base model and 310 for the Long Range edition, you're going to be spending a good amount of time behind the wheel instead of sitting at a Supercharger.  Yet no matter how engrossed you are in the act of driving, the interior of the Model 3 will probably manage to confound you at some point. Some things are just too complex.  The act of driving is more than just pressing the accelerator and pointing a car toward its destination. While you're on the road you turn things on and off and adjust various settings. At any given moment, I was changing the temperature or the volume of the radio, adjusting mirrors, using navigation, fine-tuning cruise control and sometimes even adjusting my chair. It's a dynamic experience. As you'll quickly find out, Tesla has moved some of these controls to submenus on the Model 3's giant 15-inch display.  To be clear, there are hardware controls in the car, including two buttons on the steering wheel and two stalks on the steering column. The right stalk controls the transmission and turns autopilot on and off. The left stalk is the blinker control and is used for a single wipe and cleaning the windshield. The buttons are programmable by Tesla, but the left one is mostly for controlling your media. But that's it, and the hardware situation (or lack thereof) creates a bunch of issues pertaining to usability.  The first time I noticed this I was using Tesla's semiautonomous Autopilot feature. The controls for adjusting the top speed and follow distance of adaptive cruise control are on the wheel and steering stalk on the Model S and X. They're easy to adjust without looking. On the Model 3 you have to tap the display to adjust the cruise control speed. Even worse, you have to go into a submenu to adjust the adaptive cruise control follow distance. First you tap on the car icon, then find and tap on Autopilot in the screen that pops up. Finally, you adjust the follow distance by tapping plus or minus. That's not even close to a better experience, and it's potentially dangerous, because instead of using muscle memory to find and adjust a physical item, you're reaching and tapping while looking to the right.  Plus, a few times instead of tapping Autopilot, I hit something else because of a bump. That's an ongoing issue with in-car touchscreens that every automaker should be aware of. But it didn't stop Tesla from making that display the car's primary input device.  Adjusting the mirrors also requires a few taps before they become adjustable via the two steering wheel buttons. Typically these are fixed before you start driving, so it's not that bad. But the wipers, that's a different story.  As noted earlier, you can enable a single swipe or a cleaning of the windshield via the left stalk. But anything beyond that requires using the touchscreen. The Model 3 does have automatic wipers, which work well most of the time. During a rainstorm, however, it took longer than I was comfortable with to engage and didn't wipe fast enough for my liking. To speed them up, I had to reach over and tap the speed I wanted.  If this were any other car or automaker, that would be it. I'd tell you that these usability issues make an otherwise amazing car a pain to drive. But Tesla's cars evolve while sitting in your driveway, and apparently, it's already working on these issues.  The ability to adjust the adaptive cruise control speed is coming to the right hardware button on the steering wheel. The wipers are also getting an update that puts a shortcut to start them on the left stalk. Both of these will arrive in the form of over-the-air updates. No word on whether the adaptive cruise control follow distance will also receive hardware-button support.  This is where the company shines: the ability to take feedback from owners and reviewers like myself and fix things with a software update. But I can't review a car based on what it'll do in the future. I have to make my assessment based on what's available now. And right now, I'm bewildered as to why these decisions were made in the first place.  I'm also annoyed by the lack of a dash cluster behind the steering wheel. The display that was in front of the driver on the Model S and X has been relocated to the left side of the touchscreen display. So you're looking to the right not only to see your speed but also what gear you're in and what the sensors see (which is especially important while parking) as well as to check on blinkers. It's weird for the left blinker to be flashing in your right eye.  The lack of a display ahead of the driver is even more noticeable at night. After decades of having something glowing behind the steering wheel, complete darkness from that part of the car is eerie.  Tesla isn't the first automaker to move the speedometer to the center of the dash. Mini did it decades ago. In fact, I own a Mini with the speedo in the middle of dash. I hate it. I'm not a fan. It wasn't enough to dissuade me from buying and enjoying my car. But it's something to keep in mind when you're thinking about the Model 3.  These are dramatic changes from the Model S and X. Thankfully, though, some things do carry over from those two vehicles. Even though this is the affordable Tesla (its starting price is less than half the price of the base model Model S), if you plunk down $5,000 for the Autopilot option, you're getting the same experience as the other models. Tesla continues to refine its semiautonomous system, which is one of the best in the industry. The Model 3 had very few problems staying centered in its lane and tracking cars. The auto-lane-change option felt a bit more aggressive than the last time I drove a Tesla. Most of the time it was fine, but in one instance it quickly changed lanes, then immediately started braking enough to catch everyone in the car and the vehicle behind me off guard. It's a reminder that none of these systems are ready to be left on their own.  Another place where the Tesla excels is its voice control. Even when I flubbed the names of locations, it figured out what I was trying to say. \"Umpire State Building\" was quickly changed to \"Empire State Building\" based on context. It did an outstanding job handling building numbers and parsing the names of friends I wanted to call. Currently, the feature controls navigation, the phone and media playback. But Musk said on Twitter that in the future, voice control would be integrated more into the vehicle's control, which is great news. But it'll be better when that actually happens.  Definitely. You will be able to do pretty much anything via voice command. Software team is focused on core Model 3 functionality right now, but that will be done soon, then we will add a lot more features. \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) Jan. 15th, 2018  In short, there's a lot coming to the Model 3 -- eventually.  That's what's so infuriating, because being behind the wheel of the Model 3 puts a smile on my face. It delivers on so many levels, and yet when I have to do things that would be simple in any other car, here it involves tapping and swiping when I should be looking at the road. That's frustrating. If this were a horrible car, it would be fine: You chalk it up to an overall failure of the automaker. A bad vehicle is a bad vehicle. But it's not. It's a great car held back by weird decisions. Tesla says it's working on these issues. That's great, but I can't judge a car I haven't driven yet.  So I have to caveat the hell out of this car. It's great on the road and the tech is top notch, but using some of the most important features are a pain and potentially dangerous to operate. The plus side (but not really) is that if you order the car today it'll be 12 to 18 months before it's delivered. By then, hopefully, Tesla will have a user interface that's worthy of a car as great as the Model 3. Because right now, it's complicated.", "stock": "TSLA"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-recalls-123-000-model-s-cars-over-bolt-issue-1522361482", "label": -1, "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "date": "2018-03-29", "article": "Attendees at the Bucharest Auto Show in Bucharest, Romania, studied a privately owned Tesla Inc. Model S electric vehicle on display in October 2016. On Thursday, the auto maker said it was recalling about 123,000 Model S sedans over a potential bolt issue. Photo: Vadim Ghirda/Associated Press  Tesla Inc. TSLA 2.13% is voluntarily recalling about 123,000 Model S sedans globally after discovering that certain corroding bolts in cold weather climates could lead to a power-steering failure.  The Silicon Valley auto maker on Thursday said the recall, believed to be the company\u2019s largest ever, applies to Model S sedans built before April 2016. Tesla said the issue is known to have involved less than 0.02% of the potentially affected vehicles in the U.S.  Tesla has sold about 280,000 total vehicles through the end of last year.  \u201cThere have been no injuries or accidents due to this component, despite accumulating more than a billion miles of driving,\u201d according to an email being sent to customers by Tesla. The recall to retrofit the power steering component adds to the string of challenges Chief Executive Elon Musk is dealing with as he tries to boost production of the Tesla\u2019s mass-market Model 3 sedan and conserve the company\u2019s cash supply. Moody\u2019s Investors Service this week downgraded Tesla\u2019s credit rating, concerned that the company won\u2019t meet its first-quarter goal of making 2,500 Model 3s a week. The milestone is important because further delays could crimp Tesla\u2019s cash and threaten to derail Tesla\u2019s bid to build electric cars for the masses. The downgrade, along with news this week that federal investigators were probing a fatal crash of a Tesla car, have led to a heavy selloff of the company\u2019s shares and bonds, making it potentially more difficult to raise capital. On Thursday, Tesla\u2019s stock rose 3.2%, to $266.13, during the regular trading session, and fell slightly in after-hours trading following the recall news. It has been a rough month for the stock, which has fallen about 20% over the 30-day period. Tesla is expected to reveal first-quarter production results early next week. The recall on Thursday only involves the Model S. Tesla said its service center in Montreal began noticing the issue in Model S sedans and attributed the corrosion to the calcium or magnesium salts used to treat roadways during the winter months. If the bolts fail, the car can still be steered but requires additional force. \u201cThis primarily makes the car harder to drive at low speeds and for parallel parking, but does not materially affect control at high speed, where only small steering wheel force is needed,\u201d the company said. The cost of the recall is expected to be minimal, Tesla said, with the supplier paying for the new part.

TSLA 2.13% said it updated the pay package for Chief Executive Elon Musk with a plan that again ties his compensation entirely to key performance benchmarks\u2014albeit this time much larger ones, including an ultimate goal to hit $650 billion in market value.  The pay plan, which shareholders must still approve, is designed to keep Mr. Musk as Tesla\u2019s top leader for years to come\u2014although allows for the prospect that he might evolve away from the day-to-day role of CEO into one of executive chairman and chief product officer.  The plan, which is modeled on an earlier program set for Mr. Musk in 2012, entails a 10-year grant of stock options that would vest in 12 tranches. Each would vest only if a set of two milestones are achieved, one based on market value, the other on a measure of revenue or profit. For each tranche achieved, Mr. Musk would receive shares equal to 1% of the company\u2019s total shares outstanding as of Jan. 21, 2018.  For example, the first tranche would vest if Tesla hits $100 billion in market value and $20 billion in revenue or $1.5 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, after adjusting for stock compensation. For all 12 tranches to vest, Tesla\u2019s market value would have to reach $650 billion.  Tesla, which reported revenue of $7 billion for 2016, had a market value of about $58.8 billion as of Monday\u2019s close. Mr. Musk owns about 20% of the company, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.  \u201cThis ensures that Elon will continue to lead Tesla\u2019s management over the long-term while also providing the flexibility to bring in another CEO who would report to Elon at some point in the future,\u201d Tesla said in a statement about the plan released around 12:30 a.m. on Tuesday in California. \u201cAlthough there is no current intention for this to happen, it provides the flexibility as Tesla continues to grow to potentially allow Elon to focus more of his attention on the kinds of key product and strategic matters that most impact Tesla\u2019s long-term growth and profitability.\u201d  Tesla said that if none of the tranches are achieved, Mr. Musk wouldn\u2019t receive any compensation. That would put him in similar territory to some other prominent Silicon Valley leaders who own enormously valuable stakes in their companies but receive little or no salary.  Mr. Musk\u2019s previous compensation program, granted in 2012, targeted a market value of $43.2 billion along with meeting certain milestones by 2022. It required him to remain as CEO.  Since Tesla overtook Ford Motor Co.\u2019s market value last year, and flirted with that of General Motors Co. , the Silicon Valley auto maker\u2019s valuation has been a continual point of conversation. Critics question why investors are betting so much on a company that has yet to turn an annual profit and that has delivered a fraction of the sales of much larger competitors.  Fans say they are betting on Mr. Musk\u2019s vision for personal transportation that includes electric cars that drive themselves and are powered off the company\u2019s solar panels and charged from its storage batteries.  Investor enthusiasm fueled Tesla\u2019s growth last year, even as Mr. Musk struggled to ramp up production of the Model 3 sedan, which is testing his ability to evolve the company into a more mainstream auto maker from one of a luxury niche player.  Mr. Musk has previously outlined a way for the company to reach a market cap of $700 billion, something he reiterated last year.  \u201cI could be completely delusional but I think I see a clear path to that outcome,\u201d he told analysts in May.  Mr. Musk, who also heads other companies including Space Exploration Technologies Corp., or SpaceX, has hinted that he might want to change his role at Tesla.  In May, an analyst asked Mr. Musk if he still intended to step away from Tesla after bringing out the Model 3, as he had previously suggested.  \u201cI intend to be actively involved with Tesla for the rest of my life,\u201d Mr. Musk said. \u201cHopefully, stopping before I get too old\u2014or too crazy, I don\u2019t know. But that doesn\u2019t mean I should be CEO forever.\u201d He suggested a role contributing in \u201cproduct design and technology.\u201d  Write to Tim Higgins at Tim.Higgins@WSJ.com", "stock": "TSLA"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-earnings-what-to-watch-1517999400", "label": -1, "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "date": "2018-02-07", "article": "Tesla Inc. is expected to release fourth-quarter financial results after the market closes Wednesday. Here\u2019s what you need to know:  EARNINGS FORECAST: Tesla is expected to post an adjusted loss of $3.15 a share, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet, compared with an adjusted 69 cent-a-share loss a year earlier. Adjusted results exclude stock-based and acquisition costs, and other items.  REVENUE FORECAST: Revenue is expected to rise to $3.29 billion, according to FactSet, from $2.28 billion a year earlier. Tesla has said deliveries of the Model X sport-utility vehicle, Model S sedan and new Model 3 sedan totaled 29,870 during the quarter, up 35% from a year ago. The company delivered 1,550 units of the Model 3, which began production in July.  WHAT TO WATCH:  PRODUCTION HELL: \u201cWe believe an update on the Model 3 production ramp will be the first question on many investors\u2019 minds,\u201d James Albertine, an analyst for Consumer Edge Research, said in a note to investors. Investors have watched Tesla fall months behind in its production goals after running into bottlenecks at its Fremont, Calif., assembly factory and Nevada battery plant. Chief Executive Elon Musk once had predicted reaching a rate of production of 5,000 Model 3 vehicles a week by the end of the last year\u2019s fourth quarter\u2014a prediction that had already fallen from 20,000 in December and, at one point, as many as 200,000 in the second half of 2017. Tesla ended up making 2,425 Model 3s in the fourth quarter, the company reported in January as it pushed back the goal of reaching 5,000 a week until the end of June.  CASH BURN: Mr. Musk has long said the ramp-up of the Model 3, a sedan with a $35,000 price tag aimed at making Tesla vehicles more accessible, would generate the cash needed to fund the company\u2019s expansion. The sedan\u2019s delays put that vision at risk. Tesla began the final three months of 2017 with $3.5 billion on hand and planned to spend $1 billion during the period on capital expenditures. Earlier this month, the company raised about $550 million from bonds. Tesla executives have said they need a minimum of $1 billion each quarter for working capital. Colin Langan, an analyst for UBS, estimates Tesla can generate about $1 billion in working capital once it produces 5,000 Model 3s a week. Even so, he and others expect Tesla will need to raise additional money.  WHAT\u2019S NEXT: In recent months, Mr. Musk has generated attention talking about plans for new vehicles\u2014a two-door Roadster sports car, commercial truck and compact SUV\u2014as well as new factories in Europe and China. All would cost billions of dollars. In November, he and Chief Financial Officer Deepak Ahuja hinted at internal discussions about whether Tesla needed to back away from some of its growth plans to rein in spending. Investors are anxious for clarity about the evolving strategy. Excitement over the new products may already be helping Mr. Musk\u2019s cash situation. Deposits in the fourth quarter for the new commercial truck and the sports car, as well as a sell-down in Model S and Model X inventory, may have boosted Tesla\u2019s working capital by $700 million, according to Mr. Langan\u2019s estimates.

Photo: SpaceX/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images  Tesla is literally flying high after Elon Musk\u2019s successful rocket launch, which blasted a vehicle into outer space. Fourth-quarter earnings out Wednesday, however, still point to a number of challenges back here on Earth.  Tesla reported fourth-quarter revenue of $3.3 billion and an adjusted loss of $3.04 a share. That just beat the analyst consensus loss of $3.11. But a year ago, the consensus for the fourth quarter was a loss of 17 cents a share.  There were bright spots besides the earnings. Tesla burned just $277 million in free cash, a significant improvement from recent quarters. And the company managed to avoid lowering its Model 3 production forecast for a third time in three months. The cash burn appeared lower because Tesla included customer deposits for its planned new truck and roadster in its operating cash flow. That is deceiving because these deposits aren\u2019t drawn from current operations.  Meanwhile, an alarming trend of negative operating leverage has yet to reverse itself\u2014the more cars it sells the worse its margins become. Automotive gross margin fell to 13.8%, down more than 8 percentage points from a year earlier. That trend isn\u2019t likely to meaningfully reverse any time soon. Tesla forecasts about 100,000 deliveries of its older Model S and X vehicles this year, which offer better profits than the Model 3. That won\u2019t offer much, if any, growth from the 2017 tally of 101,000 cars.  The Model 3 is supposed to carry prices up to 65% below Tesla\u2019s average selling price on older products; there will have to be substantial cost-cutting and improvements in production efficiency to even hold margins constant. Meanwhile, new industry competition coming this year won\u2019t improve pricing power.  Granted, investor faith in Mr. Musk is as strong as ever, and Tesla still enjoys open access to capital markets. Fears of a crash in the stock price aren\u2019t likely to materialize anytime soon.  However, Tesla\u2019s chances of becoming a sustainable business that doesn\u2019t need constant capital markets access to survive seems less likely than a sports car in orbit.

Tesla on Wednesday said the driver of the car was to blame, while his family said they were exploring legal options following the fatal accident. Photo: /Associated Press  Tesla Inc. TSLA 2.13% defended its semiautonomous Autopilot system in the wake of a fatal crash last month, blaming the incident on the driver after his family hired a lawyer to explore legal options.  Walter Huang died on March 23 after the Model X sport-utility vehicle he was driving southbound on Highway 101 near Mountain View, Calif., collided with a barrier and was struck by two other vehicles. The auto maker a week later said that the SUV\u2019s Autopilot was activated in the moments leading up to the crash and that the driver\u2019s hands weren\u2019t detected on the wheel for six seconds before the crash.  On Wednesday, Tesla more explicitly assigned blame to the driver. \u201cThe crash happened on a clear day with several hundred feet of visibility ahead, which means that the only way for this accident to have occurred is if Mr. Huang wasn\u2019t paying attention to the road, despite the car providing multiple warnings to do so,\u201d a Tesla spokesman said in a statement.  Earlier on Wednesday, San Francisco-based Minami Tamaki LLP announced in a statement that the family had retained its services and plans to file a wrongful-death lawsuit. The family appeared on local television on Tuesday night defending Mr. Huang\u2019s driving.  \u201cThe firm believes Tesla\u2019s Autopilot feature is defective and likely caused Huang\u2019s death, despite Tesla\u2019s apparent attempt to blame the victim of this terrible tragedy,\u201d the law firm said in a statement.  Investigators for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board are probing the crash. On April 1, the NTSB said it was unhappy with Tesla for releasing detailed information about the crash.  NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt and Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk had a recent discussion that appeared to defuse the tension. \u201cChairman Sumwalt had what he described as a very constructive conversation with Mr. Musk over the weekend,\u201d a spokesman for the NTSB said. \u201cThey discussed the investigation of the March 23 Tesla crash, NTSB investigative processes, and Tesla\u2019s work to address the safety recommendations that were issued last year as a result of the May 2016 Tesla crash in Williston, Florida.\u201d \u200bThe latter was a reference to a fatal crash involving Autopilot for which the NTSB determined Tesla shared blame.  Tesla declined to comment on the discussion.  The NTSB declined to comment\u200b on Tesla\u2019s defense of its technology in the most recent fatal crash, while NHTSA had no immediate comment.\u200bSeparately, the NTSB spokesman said the agency was investigating a battery fire linked to a Tesla Model X SUV that crashed into a garage in Lake Forest, Calif., in August 2017. The NTSB is primarily interested in the battery fire in that incident, the spokesman said. Tesla declined to comment on the battery-fire probe.  Tesla\u2019s Wednesday statement intensified its defense of semiautonomous technology amid greater scrutiny of whether humans can remain alert while using these systems. Auto makers are rolling out partially automated systems that pass control back and forth between vehicle and driver, some with technology designed to keep the driver alert, such as eye-tracking technology. Others, like Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Waymo, believe there should be no need for a human to take control in driving situations.  Autopilot, which is a collection of \u201cdriver assistance features,\u201d isn\u2019t a self-driving system. Tesla tells users in its owner\u2019s manual and in-vehicle display warnings that users need to remain alert and maintain control of the vehicle.  \u201cWe empathize with Mr. Huang\u2019s family, who are understandably facing loss and grief, but the false impression that Autopilot is unsafe will cause harm to others on the road,\u201d Tesla said Wednesday. \u201cThe reason that other families are not on TV is because their loved ones are still alive.\u201d  Tesla had said earlier that the driver took no action despite having five seconds and about 500 feet of unobstructed view of the concrete highway divider.  The 2016 fatal crash in Florida put Tesla\u2019s technology into the spotlight. The NTSB said Tesla shared partial blame for the crash, noting Autopilot allowed the driver to go long periods without his hands on the wheel and ignore the company\u2019s warnings. NHTSA, however, said the system wasn\u2019t defective and that Tesla vehicles\u2019 crash rate dropped by almost 40% after the auto-steer feature was installed. The vehicle in the 2016 accident was equipped with the auto-steer feature.  After the NTSB findings in the 2016 crash, Tesla said it would continue to be clear with current and potential customers that Autopilot doesn\u2019t render vehicles fully self-driving and that motorists must always remain attentive.

The wreckage of a Tesla vehicle after it crashed into a barrier on U.S. Highway 101 in Mountain View, Calif., last month. Photo: stringer/Reuters  The National Transportation Safety Board expressed displeasure with Tesla TSLA 2.13% Inc.\u2019s recent disclosure that the company\u2019s semiautonomous driving system was activated before a fatal crash last month in California.  The agency, which dispatched a team last week to investigate the March 23 crash, said Sunday it is \u201cunhappy\u201d that Tesla revealed detailed information it had gleaned from vehicle logs about the collision, including its suggestion that the driver had time to put his hands on the wheel and react.  Tesla declined to comment Sunday about the NTSB statement.  The rare rebuke from the U.S. agency, which investigates significant accidents involving various transportation modes, comes amid mounting scrutiny of partial and fully automated driving technologies. The NTSB is also probing the March 18 death of a pedestrian fatally struck by an Uber Technologies Inc. self-driving vehicle with a safety operator behind the wheel in Tempe, Ariz.  Not long after the NTSB expressed its disapproval Sunday, Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk joked on Twitter that the company was going bankrupt. \u201cDespite intense efforts to raise money, including a last-ditch mass sale of Easter eggs, we are sad to report that Tesla has gone completely and totally bankrupt,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSo bankrupt, you can\u2019t believe it.\u201d  Mr. Musk\u2019s tweet, which doesn\u2019t appear to be in response to the NTSB, was timed for April Fools\u2019 Day and Easter. But it also comes at a particularly sensitive time for Tesla, which is also in a tight cash situation as it tries to ramp up production of its mass-market car, the Model 3.  Tesla is expected to report first-quarter vehicle sales numbers this week, and the market will be carefully examining the company\u2019s guidance on whether or not it can hit its oft-delayed goal, of producing 5,000 Model 3 cars each week, by the end of the second quarter. Analysts say that milestone is an inflection point for Tesla when the company can start generating cash.  Tesla\u2019s shares had surged over the past couple of years on the promise that Mr. Musk could not only deliver an all-electric car for the masses, but also fulfill his vision of creating cars that drive themselves.  Tesla\u2019s disclosure on Friday that the semiautonomous system, called Autopilot, was engaged before the fatal crash near Mountain View, Calif., immediately reignited questions about the technology. A man was killed after his Tesla Model X sport-utility traveling southbound on Highway 101 collided with a barrier and was struck by two other vehicles, according to the California Highway Patrol.  Tesla late Friday said Autopilot was activated in the seconds leading up to the crash. The driver\u2019s hands weren\u2019t detected on the wheel for six seconds before the collision, the company said. Tesla said vehicle logs showed the driver took no action despite having five seconds and about 500 feet of unobstructed view of the concrete highway divider.  On Sunday, the NTSB said it needs Tesla to decode the data recorded by the vehicle. \u201cIn each of our [past] investigations involving a Tesla vehicle, Tesla has been extremely cooperative on assisting with the vehicle data,\u201d an agency spokesman said. \u201cHowever, the NTSB is unhappy with the release of investigative information by Tesla.\u201d  Newsletter Sign-up  The NTSB said it would probe all aspects of the crash, including suggestions the driver had expressed previous concerns about Autopilot. It said it would publish a preliminary report on the investigation, likely within a few weeks of completion of field work.  \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing a thorough search of our service records and we cannot find anything suggesting that the customer ever complained to Tesla about the performance of Autopilot,\u201d Tesla said in a statement. \u201cThere was a concern raised once about navigation not working correctly, but Autopilot\u2019s performance is unrelated to navigation.\u201d  The NTSB probe won\u2019t necessarily lead to sanctions against the electric car company. The NTSB determines probable causes of accidents and makes recommendations to policy makers, but doesn\u2019t issue penalties or take other punitive actions.

The trouble is, raising it suddenly looks a lot more challenging.  Moody\u2019s Investors Service downgraded Tesla\u2019s debt on Tuesday afternoon, citing persistently negative cash flow and continued production issues with the Model 3 mass-market sedan. Moody\u2019s is keeping a negative outlook on the credit due to \u201cthe likelihood that Tesla will have to undertake a large, near-term capital raise in order to refund maturing obligations and avoid a liquidity shortfall.\u201d  Tesla\u2019s bonds due in 2025, issued just last summer, were quoted near 90 cents on the dollar after hours. Meanwhile, the stock is down 23% in about a month, making equity more expensive. There are plenty of reasons that Tesla\u2019s magic touch with the capital markets is fading fast.  For starters, Tesla\u2019s financial statements paint an alarming picture of the group\u2019s long-term viability. Tesla had $3.4 billion in cash and equivalents at the end of the year and raised an additional $550 million from bonds backed by lease payments in February. Not all of that is available for spending. Customer deposits, which are mostly refundable, topped $850 million at last count.  Tesla burned more than $3.4 billion last year in free cash, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures. If that pace were to keep up, Tesla would run out of its usable cash before this year ends. Worse still, there is reason to believe the free cash burn figure was understated.  Tesla booked $666.5 million in upfront payments to install solar-energy systems as an investing cash outflow. That normally would be an operating expense, depressing free cash flow. Tesla also has managed to flatter its operating cash flow picture by stretching its working capital. Accounts payable grew by nearly $530 million in 2017 to about $2.4 billion, while accounts receivable grew by just $15 million. The difference generated more than half a billion in cash. That was a smart move to conserve resources, but the trouble is that eventually these suppliers will demand their money. They won\u2019t be comfortable if Tesla can\u2019t meet its forecast production rate of 2,500 Model 3 cars a week by the end of the first quarter.  Newsletter Sign-up  Production issues are only one part of the Model 3 problem, however. The car doesn\u2019t seem to be in as high demand as Chief Executive Elon Musk once promised investors. Analysts at Bernstein said in a research note last week that fewer than 30% of customers who have been invited to take delivery of the Model 3 have actually done so.  And Tesla can\u2019t simply cut spending to solve its cash challenge if it hopes to ramp up production. The company has racked up about $10 billion in long- term debt and has $23 billion in total liabilities. To survive long term, Tesla needs to stop overpromising and to scale back its ambitions to goals it actually can achieve. Right now, though, it just needs more money.  More debt isn\u2019t a practical solution given the current bondholder losses. An equity raise is still possible, but the recent selloff across the tech sector won\u2019t help\u2014nor will the fact that the reality of the Model 3 has so far proven to be much less attractive than the fantasy of yesteryear.  If next week\u2019s delivery update is worse than feared, the odds of keeping the lights on through this year will get a lot longer.

TSLA 2.13% contractor has sued the auto maker claiming it hasn\u2019t been paid for work at a Fremont, Calif., assembly plant where Tesla is now trying to ramp up production of the Model 3 sedan.  American Integrated Services Inc. claims Tesla hasn\u2019t paid $513,473 for lead and asbestos abatement-related work under a $3.57 million contract signed in January 2016. It filed the lawsuit Tuesday in a California state court in Oakland.  Tesla called the matter \u201ca minor commercial dispute.\u201d  \u201cWe paid AIS for all the work we authorized them to do,\u201d a Tesla spokesman said in a statement Friday. \u201cThe additional payment they\u2019re seeking is for work that we did not authorize and that clearly was unnecessary. When we asked for documentation showing that Tesla had authorized this unnecessary work, they were unable to provide it.\u201d  The claim comes as the auto maker faces questions about its cash level while it spends heavily to ramp up production of the Model 3, a compact sedan that is designed to turn the electric-car maker from a niche player to one that sells to the masses.  Large automotive suppliers are generally loath to file claims against car makers and can often carry unpaid bills while its customer works to improve its situation, betting there will be future business to win. Small companies, however, can\u2019t always make that bet, or aren\u2019t willing to do so, especially if they don\u2019t expect to do further business with the car company.  Dennis Virag, a manufacturing consultant who has worked in the automotive industry for 40 years, said auto makers generally try to pay vendors quickly unless there is a dispute about the quality or fulfillment of a contract.  The lawsuit claims the contractor had an agreement to be paid within 30 days of receipt of invoices.  \u201cTesla purchased furnishing lead and asbestos abatement, demolition and removal and other environmental and remediation services, goods, materials, labor, supplies and equipment from on or about Feb. 19, 2017, to present,\u201d the lawsuit said.  A lawyer for American Integrated Services declined to comment, citing ongoing litigation.  Production of the Model 3 began last July and has failed to reach multiple milestones set by Tesla, including one last quarter to make as many as 2,500 sedans in a single week. Tesla on Tuesday worked to reassure investors about its capital needs for the year, saying it was on track to ramp production to around 5,000 Model 3 cars a week in about three months and that would lay the ground work for \u201cstrong positive operating cash flow\u201d in the third quarter.  \u201cAs a result, Tesla does not require an equity or debt raise this year, apart from standard credit lines,\u201d the company said in the quarterly sales report.  That update followed an April Fools\u2019 Day Twitter post by Chief Executive Elon Musk that joked the company had gone bankrupt and a report from Moody\u2019s Investors Service last week downgrading Tesla\u2019s credit rating, concerned about the company\u2019s cash levels and production delays.  The company finished last year with $3.4 billion in cash on hand after its negative cash flow averaged about $1 billion a quarter on average\u2014a pace analysts have said means the company would need to raise more money this year unless it significantly boosts production.  Tesla has more than $10 billion in debt and its accounts payable has swelled to $2.39 billion at the end of the year from $1.86 billion a year earlier.  Following Tuesday\u2019s assurance that Tesla doesn\u2019t need to raise money, several analysts said they expect the company will do so later this year. Brian Johnson, an analyst for Barclays, wrote in a note to investors that he expected Tesla would need to raise $2.5 billion in the third quarter.  \u2014Andrew Scurria and Lisa Schwartz contributed to this article.

The EU decision is the latest in a series by global regulators that have amounted to billions of dollars in fines and require changes in Qualcomm business. The contract at issue with Apple is no longer in force, and Qualcomm already faces more competition from Intel and other rivals.  Still, the EU decision could make Qualcomm more vulnerable to chipmaker Broadcom Ltd\u2019s $103 billion hostile bid, since Broadcom argues it can smooth rocky relations with customers such as Apple..  Qualcomm said it would appeal the decision immediately.  The European Commission said its investigation, launched in 2015, covered the period from 2011 to 2016 and took into account Qualcomm\u2019s market dominance in LTE baseband chipsets, which enable rapid mobile broadband connections.  \u201cQualcomm paid billions of U.S. dollars to a key customer, Apple, so that it would not buy from rivals. These payments were not just reductions in price \u2013 they were made on the condition that Apple would exclusively use Qualcomm\u2019s baseband chipsets in all its iPhones and iPads,\u201d European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.  \u201cThis meant that no rival could effectively challenge Qualcomm in this market, no matter how good their products were,\u201d she said.  The fine represented 4.9 percent of Qualcomm\u2019s 2017 turnover, the Commission said.  Qualcomm General Counsel Don Rosenberg said in a statement that the company believed its agreement with Apple did not violate EU rules. \u201cWe have a strong case for judicial review and we will immediately commence that process,\u201d he said.  Qualcomm\u2019s shares were down 1.35 percent at $67.42 in midday trade, and analysts saw the fine as good for Broadcom\u2019s approach.  \u201cWhile Qualcomm believes they are in a temporary (albeit perfect) storm of customer and regulatory issues, Broadcom believes that the current problems are a harbinger of further headwinds to come,\u201d Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Bernstein, said in a note to clients Wednesday. \u201cAnd this latest finding continues to support the idea that regulators remain unhappy with the current state of affairs.\u201d  Despite levying fines, EU antitrust regulators recently cleared Qualcomm\u2019s $38 billion bid to buy NXP Semiconductors. Chinese regulators still need to approve the deal, and some NXP shareholders want a higher price.  Qualcomm is required to post a bond for the fine while the appeal unfolds, which will likely result in a charge for the current quarter. When hit with fines in the past, such as $774 million levy last year from Taiwanese regulators, Qualcomm took a charge as it appealed.  RELATIONS WITH APPLE STRAINED  Vestager told a news conference there would be no repercussions for Apple in the case.  EU antitrust regulators have come under pressure after European judges sent a case against U.S. chipmaker Intel back to an EU court for an appeal. Intel was fined 1 billion euros in 2009 for paying computer makers to buy most of their chips from them.  Google has also appealed against a record 2.4 billion euro fine for giving prominent placements in searches to its shopping service and demoting rival offerings.  This is the Commission\u2019s first decision on market abuse since the Intel ruling last September. Vestager said the ruling had given guidance on how to prove its case.  \u201cWe have carefully examined the ruling and the evidence in our case to make sure that our decision fully complies with the guidance given by the court,\u201d she said.  Apple and Qualcomm are meanwhile locked in a wide-ranging legal battle over Qualcomm\u2019s business practices, which started a year ago with Apple suing Qualcomm for nearly $1 billion in patent royalty rebates that the chipmaker allegedly withheld from the phone maker.  Other regulators, including the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, are also investigating Qualcomm\u2019s dealings with Apple. The EU competition enforcer is expected to rule in the coming months against Qualcomm in another case involving British phone software maker Icera, which was later acquired by Nvidia Corp, a person familiar with the matter has told Reuters.

Apple is looking to reassert dominance in U.S. schools, where inexpensive laptops running software from Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google and Microsoft Corp now top iPad by sales, offering a cheap way to get to cloud-based productivity tools.  The new iPad has a more powerful computing chip and an extensive set of new, free software for teachers to manage students and schoolwork. But the unchanged starting price of $299 for students and $329 for the general public, without a keyboard or case, compares with less than $200 for some Windows and Google Chrome models.  Apple shares were down 1.4 percent to $170.26 after the event, slightly better than the NASDAQ Composite, which was down 1.6 percent in midday trading.  Some analysts had believed Apple might cut prices, but the company stuck with its more traditional approach of packing more features into a device.  Despite the new software, Apple faces a tough battle in the educational market given the popularity of Google and Microsoft\u2019s productivity suites, said Carolina Milanesi of Creative Strategies. Google\u2019s G Suite fueled Chromebook sales because it was seen as easy to use to manage assignments.  \u201cMost teachers don\u2019t look past G Suite for education,\u201d she said.  Apple, as part of its response, on Tuesday announced improvements in its iWork suite at an event in Chicago, where school bells and announcements over a public address system directed press and more than 300 teachers into an auditorium at Lane Tech College Prep High School.  The event came during a spring buying season when many schools are making purchasing decisions for the upcoming school year.  \u201cWe\u2019ve been at this for 40 years and we care deeply about education,\u201d Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said at the event.  Apple executives said the new iPad works with its pencil accessory and features an upgraded A10 Fusion chip, the same CPU that powers the iPhone 7. It is available immediately.  The Apple Pencil remains priced at $99 for the public and $89 for schools, though Lenovo will release a device called Crayon for $49, the first third-party stylus to work with the iPad.

REUTERS/John Gress  Apple made up just 17 percent of the K-12 U.S. educational market in the third quarter, according to data from Futuresource Consulting. Meanwhile 60 percent of mobile computing shipments to schools ran Google\u2019s Chrome and 22 percent had Windows.  Chromebooks sold by Dell Technologies Inc cost as little as $189. Microsoft last year introduced an education-focused laptop from Lenovo Group Ltd running Windows 10 S for a similar price.  Acer Inc announced a tablet that runs Chrome OS for $329 on Monday that comes with a built-in stylus.  Apple in recent years made changes to its operating system so that more than one student can log into an iPad, and to its software to let teachers better manage students.  On Tuesday it updated iWork - which includes word processing, spreadsheet and presentation software - to allow students to take handwritten notes more easily, along with adding more free storage on its iCloud service.  Apple also released a new app called Schoolwork to help teachers create assignments and track student progress. Google has a similar app for managing student profiles, but analysts highlighted Apple\u2019s Schoolwork app as unique in helping teachers manage assignments and progress.  The previously iPad-focused Classroom teacher administration app would start working on Mac computers in June, Apple said.  In the fall Apple will roll out \u201cEveryone Can Create\u201d lessons on video, photography, music, and drawing, joining existing \u201cEveryone Can Code\u201d guides for computer programming skills.  The new courses highlight features that some low-priced laptops do not have, such as a camera and microphone.  \u201cIf you look at it as a Chromebook competitor, it\u2019s expensive. But if you look at it and say, I can do music with GarageBand, I can take pictures or use it as a video camera and now I can do (augmented reality) ... it appeals to teachers and schools that want to push the envelope on education,\u201d Milanesi said.

REUTERS/Charles Platiau  Wall Street\u2019s optimism about last year\u2019s 10th anniversary iPhone had propelled Apple\u2019s stock 24 percent higher over the past 12 months, giving it a market capitalization of $893 billion.  That is $141 billion more than the $752 billion market value of Amazon, the world\u2019s third most valuable publicly listed company, but Amazon has been quickly closing the gap.  (For graphic on Market Capitalization: Apple vs Amazon.com vs Alphabet, click: reut.rs/2Fn9hzA)  Amazon\u2019s stock has surged 83 percent over the past year, bolstered by scorchingly fast revenue growth as more shopping moves online and businesses shift their computing operations to the cloud, where Amazon Web Services leads the market.  In January, Amazon announced that it, Berkshire Hathaway Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co would form a company to cut health care costs for their employees, which was widely seen as a threat to the existing U.S. healthcare system and underscored Amazon\u2019s ability to disrupt markets.  Amazon dislodged Microsoft Corp as the No. 3 U.S. company by market capitalization in February.  At $783 billion, Alphabet Inc has the second largest market capitalization. The Google parent company\u2019s stock has grown about 33 percent over the past year, faster than Apple but far slower than Amazon.  Meanwhile, optimism about Apple\u2019s iPhone X has given way to concerns that demand for the $1,000 device may be weaker than expected.  To be sure, past stock gains are not a reliable predictor of future performance, and the surge in Amazon shares in recent years has been exceptional by most standards.  But if Amazon\u2019s stock were to keep growing on the trajectory seen over the past year, the company\u2019s market capitalization would hit $1 trillion in late August. Apple would reach $1 trillion around a week later if its stock price continued to rise at the same pace seen over the past year.  Alphabet would not reach $1 trillion until 2019 if its stock price continued to rise at the same pace seen over the past year.

VirnetX\u2019s stock rose as much as 44 percent on the news in after hours trading. The company closed at $4.10 per share on Tuesday.  Apple\u2019s stock has seen little change on the news given that the $502.6 million award is minuscule compared to the company\u2019s profits. The company generated $20 billion profit in the first quarter, the company said in February.  VirnetX claimed that Apple\u2019s FaceTime, VPN on Demand and iMessage features infringe four patents related to secure communications, claims that Apple denied.  The dispute has bounced between the district court, patent office and Federal Circuit since 2010. There have been multiple trials, most recently one involving earlier versions of the Apple devices. A jury in that case awarded $302 million that a judge later increased to $439.7 million.  Kendall Larsen , CEO of VirnetX, said the damages, which were based on sales of more than 400 million Apple devices, were \"fair.\"  \"The evidence was clear,\" Larsen said after the verdict was announced. \"Tell the truth and you don\u2019t have to worry about anything.\"  Apple lawyers declined to comment.  For VirnetX, the jury verdict in its favor could be a short-lived victory. The Patent Trial and Appeal Board has said the patents are invalid, in cases that are currently before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington.  The Federal Circuit, which handles all patent appeals, declined to put this trial on hold, saying it was so far along that a verdict would come before a final validity decision.  VirnetX, based in Zephyr Cove, Nevada, reported just over $1 million in revenue last year but investors have boosted the stock by more than 70 percent in hopes of an eventual victory over Apple.  The company started within government contractor SAIC Inc., tasked with developing secure communications for the Central Intelligence Agency.

Investors seeking to gauge demand for the iPhone last quarter got clues Wednesday from Qualcomm Inc. and Broadcom Ltd., two of Apple Inc.\u2019s biggest suppliers.  Both companies indicated that orders related to the iPhone tailed off more than normal at this time of year. That helped round out a flurry of reports in recent weeks that suggested demand for the flagship handset hasn\u2019t met rosy predictions, dragging on Apple\u2019s shares.  Qualcomm said that orders from a large customer tailed off at worse-than-typical levels in the quarter. San Diego-based Qualcomm didn\u2019t identify the company, but the remarks were widely interpreted as referring to Apple. Broadcom said it expects a \u201cgreater-than-seasonal decline in wireless\u201d components, indicating fewer-than-anticipated sales of its chips for its fiscal second quarter, which ends in April. Broadcom provides wireless network and Bluetooth components for the iPhone. Christopher Rolland, an analyst at Susquehanna Investment Group, pegged Apple as the reason for the order slowdown in a note Wednesday.  Apple reports earnings after the close of trading. Analysts have projected revenue of $84 billion to $87 billion for the holiday quarter, including from its new flagship iPhone X, which went on sale in November. However, supply chain reports have indicated that the Cupertino, California-based technology giant has cut iPhone X orders in half for early 2018. Multiple analysts also have said the iPhone X was not the holiday smash hit that some expected.  The company\u2019s stock gained 48 cents to $167.91 as of 1:30 p.m. in New York. Through Wednesday, it had declined 6.6 percent since reaching a record Jan. 18 as talk of an iPhone slump set in. BMO Capital Markets downgraded its rating on the stock Wednesday. Ming-Chi Kuo, at KGI Securities, recently warned that iPhone X sales weren\u2019t as strong as anticipated in China. JPMorgan wrote that \"demand has gone sour quickly,\" and a survey by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners found iPhone X models made up just a fifth of iPhone sales in the holiday quarter.  A smaller supplier, Qorvo Inc., predicted current quarter sales of as little as $645 million, missing analysts\u2019 estimates by more than $100 million. Qorvo makes radio-frequency chips and gets about 40 percent of its sales from Apple, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Apple declined to comment on the suppliers\u2019 forecasts.

The Cupertino, California-based company said revenue in the three months ending in March will be $60 billion to $62 billion. Analysts were looking for $65.9 billion on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  For the final quarter of 2017, Apple said it sold 77.3 million iPhones, down 1 percent from a year earlier and below analysts\u2019 projections of 80.2 million units. The average selling price was $796 -- ahead of expectations -- suggesting its flagship iPhone X handset sold relatively well, while cheaper versions weren\u2019t as popular.  The numbers, which would be extraordinary for virtually any other company in the world, underscore the elevated expectations that investors have for Apple. They also highlight concern about lackluster demand for iPhones, sparked by recent reports of Apple cutting orders to suppliers and lower analyst estimates. Fewer new handsets means Apple has to work harder to sell related services, accessories and other devices. It also leaves less time for the company to create its next big hit, potentially in wearable technology, augmented reality or even transportation.  Apple reported fiscal first-quarter revenue of $88.3 billion, and profit of $3.89 a share, beating average analyst estimates.  Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said the 2017 holiday period was a week shorter, compared with 2016, limiting iPhone sales. \"We are very, very happy with the guidance we are providing,\" he added, noting that sales of handsets were strong in all regions.  \"IPhone X was the most popular phone and since we launched it in early November, for every week it\u2019s been the top selling iPhone,\" Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said in an interview. \"Couldn\u2019t be prouder of it.\"  Apple shares fell about 1 percent in extended trading, after closing at $167.78 in New York on Thursday. The stock had dropped about six percent in the days leading up to earnings.  The iPhone X, which went on sale in November, is available in $999 and $1,149 configurations, at least $150 more than any iPhone starting price that came before.

The U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating whether Apple violated securities laws concerning its disclosures about a software update that slowed some handsets, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News on Tuesday. The U.S. government has requested information from the company, according to the people, who asked not to be named because the probe is private.  The inquiry is in early stages, they cautioned, and it\u2019s too soon to conclude any enforcement will follow.

Photographer: Michael Nagle/Bloomberg  Several weeks ago, Apple said a software update released in early 2017 slowed down the performance of older iPhones models as a way to avoid the phones shutting down at random. When it released the update, the company hadn\u2019t said the software would slow down the devices. In December, Apple apologized for not clearly communicating this information and vowed to release another update to mitigate the concern.  Earlier in January, Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook told ABC News that when the company put out the software update that caused the performance issues for older iPhones \u201cwe did say what it was, but I don\u2019t think a lot of people were paying attention. And maybe we should have been clearer.\u201d  The slowdowns occur when an older iPhone\u2019s battery reaches a certain, unspecified point of low health and can be fixed if a user replaces the battery. As part of its public apology, Apple cut the prices of battery replacements in its stores to $29, a $50 discount.  Apple plans to release an iPhone software update, called iOS 11.3, in the next few months with new features that let users monitor the health of their batteries and protect against slowdowns. If consumers turn off the throttling, older iPhones will be more prone to randomly rebooting, Apple has said. The system affects iPhone 7 models and older, but not the iPhone 8 and iPhone X, according to the company.  John Thune Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg  After apologizing to customers in December, Apple was sued by consumer advocacy groups and individual iPhone users in a global backlash. Government officials, including U.S. Senator John Thune, a Republican from South Dakota, have also questioned Apple about the slowdowns.  \u201cEven if Apple\u2019s actions were indeed only intended to avoid unexpected shutdowns in older phones, the large volume of consumer criticism leveled against the company in light of its admission suggests that there should have been better transparency with respect to these practices,\u201d Thune wrote in a January letter to Cook.

Apple will be told to file the transaction to the Brussels-based antitrust authority, who will take over the merger review from Austria, where it was originally declared.  Big technology mergers involving startups with insignificant revenue usually fall through the EU\u2019s usual net for checking whether deals harm competition across the bloc. However, alarmed that it nearly missed Facebook Inc.\u2019s takeover of messaging service WhatsApp, the EU is seeking to change its rules to allow it to take charge of acquisitions where a target company makes no money but holds valuable technology or intellectual property.  Apple announced its purchase of the U.K.-based app in December, for a reported $400 million, according to people familiar with the transaction, which would make it one of Apple\u2019s largest acquisitions. The Shazam app uses the microphone on a smartphone or computer to identify almost any song playing nearby, then points users to places they can listen to it, such as Apple Music or Spotify Ltd.  The acquisition would help Apple embed that capability more deeply into its music offerings. The company\u2019s digital assistant Siri was integrated with Shazam in 2014, so users could ask it what song is playing in the background.  The EU may be worried that once Shazam is under Apple\u2019s control, the iPhone maker could choose to make Apple Music the only option for listening to tracks. That could divert some of the referrals from Shazam that currently go to London-based Spotify. The acquisition also gives Apple access to a large user data base of people\u2019s musical interests.  Apple hasn\u2019t indicated that it plans to make Shazam an exclusive for Apple Music, but in the past the company has sometimes made acquired features compatible only with its products. It also has sometimes kept support for properties it\u2019s bought, for example, when Cupertino, California-based Apple acquired Beats Music to develop Apple Music, Apple released an Android version of the program.  Apple said it would work with the EU on the matter, but declined to provide further detail. The EU took up the review after Austria, Iceland, Italy, France, Norway, Spain and Sweden all asked it to do so.  The EU reviewed and approved the Facebook-WhatsApp deal after several European authorities asked the commission to step in. Facebook was later fined for misleading the EU during the merger probe. It had told the regulators it couldn\u2019t combine WhatsApp data with its other services but moved to do so shortly after the deal was finalized.  \u2014 With assistance by Mark Gurman", "stock": "AAPL"}, {"url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-16/apple-ceo-cook-meets-treasury-secretary-mnuchin-at-headquarters", "label": -1, "source": "bloomberg", "date": "2018-03-16", "article": "Apple Inc.

Apple also told employees Wednesday that it\u2019s issuing stock-based bonuses worth $2,500 each following the new U.S. tax law, according to people familiar with the matter.  In its December approval of the most extensive tax-code revisions since 1986, Congress scrapped the previous international tax system for corporations -- an unusual arrangement that allowed companies to defer U.S. income taxes on foreign earnings until they returned the income to the U.S. That \u201cdeferral\u201d provision led companies to stockpile an estimated $3.1 trillion offshore and many were criticized for the moves, including Apple.  By switching to a new system that\u2019s designed to focus on domestic economic activity, congressional tax writers also imposed a two-tiered levy on that accumulated foreign income: Cash will be taxed at 15.5 percent, less liquid assets at 8 percent. Companies can pay over eight years.  New Jobs  Apple is the first major U.S. technology company to act on the new tax law and it joins others, such as Intel Corp., in responding to criticism by President Donald Trump and others that corporations have been ignoring American workers and manufacturing. Job creation was a key pillar of Trump\u2019s election campaign. That means the new positions created by Apple are likely to have a more significant political impact than its $38 billion tax payment, according to Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business.  \u201cThe thrust here is American jobs, jobs on American soil, build manufacturing here, don\u2019t build everything in China,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cYou can\u2019t have an announcement of a million jobs. But you can have companies like Apple saying that we\u2019re going to have 20,000 new jobs here. If other companies say they\u2019re going to have new jobs too, it does add up.\u201d  For more on Apple, check out the Decrypted podcast:  Later Wednesday, Trump tweeted a response lauding Apple\u2019s announcement. \u201cI promised that my policies would allow companies like Apple to bring massive amounts of money back to the United States,\u201d he wrote. \u201cGreat to see Apple follow through as a result of TAX CUTS. Huge win for American workers and the USA!\u201d  Apple has the largest offshore cash reserves of any U.S. company, with about $252 billion at the end of September, the most recently reported fiscal quarter. The tax rate indicates that Apple is likely bringing back a majority of its overseas cash back to the U.S., leaving only a small portion for international investments like retail stores.  \u201cThey\u2019re going to have well over $200 billion by the end of this year that will be available for incremental investments, capital returns and M&A,\u201d said Matthew Kanterman, a New York-based Bloomberg Intelligence analyst. The new tax law lets U.S. companies bring overseas cash reserves back home in one year and pay the resulting tax bill over eight years. \u201cAnd Apple hasn\u2019t historically done big M&A,\u201d he said.  Five-Year Spending Plan  The $30 billion in capital expenditures will come as part of $350 billion that Apple expects to spend in the U.S. over the next five years. The 20,000 new jobs include additional Apple employees at its campuses, data centers, and retail stores, but not third-party developers for iPhone and Mac apps, an economy Apple has touted in the past.  Apple said that part of the $30 billion in capital expenditures will go toward a new U.S.-based campus, new data centers and additional supplier investments. The company, which opened a new headquarters in Cupertino last year, said its new U.S. site initially will be focused on employees who provide technical support to Apple product users. The new location, which Apple said it will announce later this year, will be similar to the company\u2019s existing campus in Austin, Texas, for supply-chain and technical-support employees.  Can This Tax Proposal Lure Companies and Cash Home?: QuickTake  Apple said it will increase its local manufacturing fund, announced last year, from $1 billion to $5 billion, indicating that it will be sourcing more components for its products domestically. As part of the original fund, Apple invested in Corning Inc. and Finisar Corp., companies that make components for iPhone glass screens and lasers for Face ID and AirPods, respectively.  \u201cThese are probably many capital expenditure initiatives and new site build-outs that Apple was already planning on doing regardless of repatriation,\u201d said Michael Olson, an analyst at Piper Jaffray, who has the equivalent of a buy rating on the stock.  \u201cWhat\u2019s not said in this release is that there is more potential for increased buybacks for shareholders and acquisitions that might not have taken place if it were not for the cash influx from overseas,\u201d Olson said.

Like with its mobile devices -- the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch -- Apple intends to frequently update the AirPods with new hardware features. The Cupertino, California-based technology giant is working on a new version for release as soon as this year with an upgraded wireless chip, the people said. A subsequent model for as early as next year is planned to be water resistant, they added, asking not to be identified discussing private product plans.  Apple Inc. AirPod wireless headphones. Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg  The model coming as early as this year will let people summon Apple\u2019s Siri digital assistant without physically tapping the headphones by saying \"Hey Siri.\" The function will work similarly to how a user activates Siri on an iPhone or a HomePod speaker hands-free. The headphones, internally known as B288, will include an upgraded Apple-designed wireless chip for managing Bluetooth connections. The first AirPods include a chip known as the W1, and Apple released the W2 with the Apple Watch last year.  The idea for the water-resistant model is for the headphones to survive splashes of water and rain, the people said. They likely won\u2019t be designed to be submerged in water. The latest iPhones can survive splashes, while the Apple Watch is considered \"swim-proof.\" Apple\u2019s plans could change or be delayed, the people said. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.  Apple's Other Sales Boom Other Products category is Apple's fastest growing division thanks to devices like AirPods  The AirPods are designed by the same department that produced the HomePod speaker, Bloomberg News reported last year. Apple introduced the first AirPods in 2016 alongside the iPhone 7 as a way to replace the traditional wired headphone jack. Since launch, AirPods have been considered one of the top-performing Apple products and have resonated with both reviewers and consumers.  Apple\u2019s W1 chip in Airpods. Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg  The product helped take wireless headphones mainstream. It was one of the first models to be fully wireless and come in a case that charges the headset. Similar products followed from Google, Sony Corp., Samsung Electronics Co., Motorola and Bose. AirPods accounted for 85 percent of the money spent in the U.S. on wireless headphones since they debuted, research firm NPD Group estimated last year.  Apple\u2019s Other Products segment, which includes AirPods, Beats headphones, the Watch, Apple TV and accessories, generated more than $5 billion in revenue for the first time in the company\u2019s fiscal first quarter, representing 36 percent year-over-year growth.  \"Wearables were the second-largest contributor to revenue growth after iPhone, which is impressive,\" Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said during a conference call with analysts earlier this month, adding that sales jumped almost 70 percent last year.  The category may continue to grow. Apple has said it is releasing an upgraded AirPods case this year that allows the headphones to be recharged wirelessly, like the iPhone X. The company is also working on an augmented-reality headset that would launch in 2020 at the earliest, Bloomberg News has reported.  Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman takes a closer look at Apple AirPods.

Apple runs one of the largest manufacturing chains in the world, but most of the work is done at factories owned by contractors.  Apple audited 756 suppliers in 30 countries, 197 of which it was auditing for the first time.  Apple said in its annual supplier responsibility report that the proportion of \"low performers,\" or suppliers scoring less than 59 points on its 100-point scale, fell to 1 percent in 2017 from 3 percent in 2016 and 14 percent in 2014. \"High performers\" with scores of more than 90 rose to a record high of 59 percent from 47 percent the year before.  Apple found 44 so-called \"core violations\" of its labor rules in 2017, double the previous year. Those included three instances of employees forced to pay excessive fees for a job, a practice Apple banned in 2015.  In one case, over 700 foreign contract workers recruited from the Philippines were charged a total of $1 million to work for a supplier. Apple said it forced the supplier to repay the money.  Compliance with Apple's 60-hour work week fell to 94 percent of suppliers from 98 percent the year before. Moreover, Apple said it uncovered 38 cases of falsification of working hours data in 2017, up from 9 cases the year before.  Apple said the increase was driven by the fact that it brought on a number of new suppliers in 2017 and started tracking the working hours data of 1.3 million supplier employees, 30 percent more than in previous years.  In the report, Apple also said it was launching a new women's' health initiative at its supplier plants, with a goal of reaching 1 million women by 2020. And it said that it had launched a program in China to train workers to become factory line leaders, who often make 20 percent to 30 percent more than line workers.  On Wednesday, Apple also issued its so-called conflict minerals report, which is required by United States securities regulators. The report lists suppliers of sensitive metals such as tin and gold.  Apple company said that 16 smelters and refiners left its supply chain in 2017, 10 of which were dropped because they would not participate in a third-party audit of their practices. Six left of their own accord.  Apple also outlined new rules on student labor after a discovery last year that some Chinese students were working more than 11 hours a day assembling its iPhone X.

That's especially true because a number of customers worry about the safety of electronic payment methods, and might be wary of letting their information sit idly in a wallet they don't often use. Sending intermittent notifications, or timing them based on users' locations or at purchasing opportunities, could be a more effective way for Apple to remind iPhone users of their access to Apple Pay.

Because there are secrets inside the spaceship.  \"The problem with opening up the main facility for tours is we have so much confidential stuff around,\" Cook said. \"It's sort of the bane of my existence to hold things confidential now.\"  Cook's answer echoes a comment about the campus last year from Apple's head designer, Jony Ive, who called it \"our house.\"  \"We didn't make Apple Park for other people,\" Ive said. \"So I think a lot of the criticisms ... are utterly bizarre, because it wasn't made for you.

Fans and tourists are \"the reason we created the visitors center, which has the AR experience,\" Cook said, referring to Apple's augmented-reality space that includes a scale model of an Apple Park that you can animated with an iPad camera.  \"If you haven't been to this, I'd really encourage you to do it,\" he said.  He continued: \"The roof deck gives you a nice visual.

In recent weeks, Wall Street analysts have come to a consensus that iPhone X sales were slower than previously expected for the first quarter that ended in December and may drop off sharply for the March quarter.  Analysts have lowered their expectations for Apple's second- quarter revenue guidance to as low as $60 billion from a previous average of $67 billion.  Combined with concerns about the impact of an imbroglio in which Apple acknowledged slowing down phones with worn-out batteries, the weak iPhone X performance has again raised the question of whether the company can keep up its rapid revenue growth without a new hit product.  With eight different iPhone models priced from $350 to $999 on sale over the holidays, Apple showed that it has moved decisively away from co-founder Jobs' tight lineup of premium-priced products and embraced an iPhone-for-everybody strategy.  Analysts are questioning whether Apple can boost its revenue even as iPhone sales essentially plateau.  \"Apple will have to answer the question of what's next,\" UBS analyst Steven Milunovich wrote in a note to investors. \"More services to monetize the base of one billion customers and eventually enhanced [augmented reality] capabilities may be part of the answer.\"  Analysts still expect Apple to post record revenue, hitting the top of its $87 billion guidance for the holiday quarter. But they have slashed revenue estimates for the March quarter and expect the company to sell fewer iPhones in fiscal 2018 than initially thought.  Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi predicted as few as 220 million iPhones will sell in fiscal 2018, just above the 216.7 million sold in 2017 and well below the 2015 peak of 231.2 million.  BTIG analyst Walter Piecyk spotlighted a steadily lengthening replacement cycle as new iPhones offer only small improvements over prior models. Now that it has become clear that a new battery can give life to an old phone, more customers may choose to delay an upgrade, especially with Apple cutting the price of a battery replacement to $29 from $79.  Analysts still believe Apple will report sales of $272.2 billion for its fiscal 2018, 18.7 percent above its $229.2 billion in fiscal 2017. That will be driven largely by higher average prices paid for iPhones, they said.  'WILD CARD'  But Apple does not give data on specific models, and with the wider lineup, analysts must do more guesswork based on surveys and other tools. They also find it harder to predict how much money Apple makes off each phone.  \"We believe that gross margins are a key wild card for investors, given limited transparency into relative margins across iPhone [models],\" Sacconaghi said in a note to investors.  All in all, it's a far cry from the days of Jobs, who shrank the company's product lineup when he returned to the helm in 1997 and kept it limited to a few models of each product at one time until his death in 2011.  But the Apple of today has something Jobs never had: An imposing user base into which it can sell a host of other products and services.  Trip Miller, managing partner at Gullane Capital and an Apple investor, believes Apple's services segment is the firm's next hit product. Analyst expect it to hit sales of $34.7 billion this year, up 16 percent.

Beck Diefenbach/Reuters  Apple acquired music recognition app Shazam in December for a reported $400 million.  It was clear Apple would integrate Shazam into its streaming service Apple Music \u2014 but neither company has given more detail.  Shazam's earliest big investor thinks Apple could get up to 7.5 million new Apple Music subscribers as a result of the deal \u2014 a nice bump to its existing 30 million subscribers.  Analyst Mark Mulligan said the acquisition is probably a combination of subscribers, plus the valuable data Shazam can give on what streaming services people use and what songs they really like.  To understand what Apple might do with its latest acquisition Shazam, you have to understand its evolving business model, according to early investor DN Capital.  The venture capital firm's chief executive, Nenad Marovac, first invested in Shazam in 2004, when its music recognition tech involved users dialling a number, holding up their phones to a source of music, then receiving an SMS \"tag\" which identified a song. Now, the song recognition is done through an app.  \"The way Shazam started off its business model was that after five [SMS] 'tags' you had to pay for it,\" said Marovac. \"Then it moved into lead-generation for MP3s, then it became an affiliate for streaming companies.\"  In other words, if you identified a song, then clicked a link inside Shazam to buy the song through iTunes, a cut of your payment would go to Shazam. But that became less profitable when streaming took off.  Apple once dominated music consumption, when people bought individual MP3 tracks through iTunes. Since the advent of Spotify, it hasn't kept up. Shazam might be a way to drive growth once again.  \"Since Apple has launched Apple Music, it's still a way behind the curve, behind Spotify,\" said Marovac. \"Shazam has 150 million active users a month, and about 300 million to 400 million uniques per year. If you convert 1% to 5% of those users to Apple Music, the investment will pay for itself in spades.\"  BI Graphics  Apple Music had 30 million paying subscribers, according to statistics released in September. Adding 5% of Shazam's base would add a maximum of 7.5 million paying users \u2014 a nice bump, but also best case scenario.  For long-time music industry watcher and Midia analyst Mark Mulligan, the deal is more than just generating paying users for Apple Music.  Apple really needs data to persuade people to use Apple Music more  Customer acquisition is one reason why Apple might have acquired Shazam, Mulligan told Business Insider. It's also likely Shazam will give Apple Music much needed new features that will keep users sticking around for longer, like Spotify's massively successful playlists.  \"Ultimately Apple will have relatively small concerns about how it will be able to acquire customers for Apple Music in the longer term,\" Mulligan said.  \"In relative terms, it's behind Spotify in terms of playlists and weekly active use,\" he added. \"Those are the metrics it needs to do more to drive. The Shazam dataset will be an important asset.\"  When you open the Shazam app and identify a song, you can then stream that song via Apple Music or rivals like Amazon Music and Spotify. That's valuable insight into how people are using other services.  \"It's a window into billions of data points about Shazam's Spotify, Amazon, and Deezer users, there's some value in that,\" said Mulligan. \"It really comes down \u2014 how short was the iTunes dataset coming up? If iTunes' data on a decade of user preferences wasn't good enough, then maybe Shazam was necessary.\"  Mulligan likened the Shazam acquisition to Spotify's purchase of Echo Nest, which now informs its massively successful playlists. It's the poor man's version though. \"To be frank, if I could choose between Shazam and Echo Nest, I'd pick Echo Nest any day,\" he said.  With so competition in music streaming, Shazam is also a signal that Apple is \"serious\" about music. \"Look at Yahoo,\" said Mulligan. \"That should have died off a decade ago, but they kept going by making big acquisitions that made people think Yahoo was serious. It used its increased market cap to then make another overpriced acquisition. There's a proven business model in making overpriced acquisitions to companies vaguely relevant to the space.\"", "stock": "AAPL"}, {"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/02/27/apple-is-launching-its-own-medical-clinics-for-its-employees/", "label": -1, "source": "techcrunch", "date": "2018-02-27", "article": "Apple isn\u2019t just a tech company as the company is now hiring doctors and other medical staff to create its own medical clinics.

The dashboard, called Apple Music for Artists, is currently available only for select beta users ahead of a broader launch planned for later this spring.  The move is clearly a competitive measure against Spotify, which has been steadily ramping up its products for artists over the past year.  Last April, it launched its own artist dashboard out of beta, allowing artists to dive into streaming insights and analytics, manage their profile and more. In October, Spotify debuted a dedicated app for artists with access to similar data, including real-time data on new releases. That same month, it also announced the launch of its emerging artist program called RISE.  Pandora has a dashboard for artists, too, and offers tools that allow them to connect with fans using short audio messages, or to alert them about new releases, live events, ticket offers and more.  Apple, clearly, needed to catch up.  Apple\u2019s advantage with its new dashboard is that it track both streams and purchases at a granular level.  The dashboard shows the current number of plays, spins, song purchases and album purchases in its interface, going as far back as the 2015 launch of Apple Music itself. An insights panel reveals other milestones, like all-time number of plays and purchases for specific songs, or cumulatively, reports Billboard.  There\u2019s also a global map that artists can click on and drill down to the city level to see how their music is performing in that location and user demographics.

Apple will begin testing the dashboard with beta users who will provide feedback ahead of a public launch. Apple Music for Artists will open publicly later this spring for Apple\u2019s several million artists.  Of course, it\u2019s unlikely that artists will use only Apple Music\u2019s dashboard at this point.

That has involved IBM sharing its enterprise expertise with Apple and Apple sharing its design sense with IBM. The companies have actually built hundreds of enterprise apps running on iOS devices. Today, they took that friendship a step further when they announced they were providing a way to combine IBM Watson machine learning with Apple Core ML to make the business apps running on Apple devices all the more intelligent.  The way it works is that a customer builds a machine learning model using Watson, taking advantage of data in an enterprise repository to train the model. For instance, a company may want to help field service techs point their iPhone camera at a machine and identify the make and model to order the correct parts. You could potentially train a model to recognize all the different machines using Watson\u2019s image recognition capability.  The next step is to convert that model into Core ML and include it in your custom app. Apple introduced Core ML at the Worldwide Developers Conference last June as a way to make it easy for developers to move machine learning models from popular model building tools like TensorFlow, Caffe or IBM Watson to apps running on iOS devices.  After creating the model, you run it through the Core ML converter tools and insert it in your Apple app. The agreement with IBM makes it easier to do this using IBM Watson as the model building part of the equation. This allows the two partners to make the apps created under the partnership even smarter with machine learning.  \u201cApple developers need a way to quickly and easily build these apps and leverage the cloud where it\u2019s delivered. [The partnership] lets developers take advantage of the Core ML integration,\u201d Mahmoud Naghshineh, general manager for IBM Partnerships and Alliances explained.  To make it even easier, IBM also announced a cloud console to simplify the connection between the Watson model building process and inserting that model in the application running on the Apple device.  Over time, the app can share data back with Watson and improve the machine learning algorithm running on the edge device in a classic device-cloud partnership. \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of this combination. As you run the application, it\u2019s real time and you don\u2019t need to be connected to Watson, but as you classify different parts [on the device], that data gets collected and when you\u2019re connected to Watson on a lower [bandwidth] interaction basis, you can feed it back to train your machine learning model and make it even better,\u201d Naghshineh said.  The point of the partnership has always been to use data and analytics to build new business processes, by taking existing approaches and reengineering them for a touch screen.  \u201cThis adds a level of machine learning to that original goal moving it forward to take advantage of the latest tech. \u201cWe are taking this to the next level through machine learning. We are very much on that path and bringing improved accelerated capabilities and providing better insight to [give users] a much greater experience,\u201d Naghshineh said.", "stock": "AAPL"}, {"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/03/27/apples-pencil-now-works-with-its-iwork-toolkit/", "label": -1, "source": "techcrunch", "date": "2018-03-27", "article": "Apple is bringing its pencil to the masses.

The Olympics section will appear in the \u201cFor You\u201d section, the part of Apple News where the platform delivers a more personalised set of stories based on publications and channels that you look at regularly.

The portal will work outside of the US \u2014 everywhere that Apple News is live \u2014 but since NBC only holds the rights to coverage in the U.S. the video links will only appear and work there. The other partners involved are essentially Apple\u2019s other news partners.  While this Winter Olympics section will be appearing in News, the portal will be doing more than just reporting what has happened in the latest events. It will also include a planner for people to figure out what is showing when, and let you add events you want to watch to your calendar.  It will also link to live streams, although these and full replays of specific events will link outside to the NBC Sports app, Apple says. Clips from events can be watched directly within the Apple News app. There will also be a medal tracker and morning roundups for those in timezones that are far from where the games are taking place.  Apple itself has been making several moves to beef up its own content plays. The thinking is that having more exclusivity and ownership of what is provided on its own video and music services could be a way of differentiating them from the rest of the digital media pack, and potentially making them more attractive for consumers to pay to use.  Sports has not really been a huge focus in that context up to now \u2014 a deal with Spielberg and family-friendly comedies and dramas with broad appeal seem to be the order of the day. However, Apple did add a dedicated Sports tab to Apple TV in September, perhaps laying the groundwork for this and many more activities down the line.

Both Google\u2019s and Apple\u2019s news hits speak to how those in the business of tech but outside the traditional business of media are looking to get their own share of audience around the Olympics, which is one of the most-watched sporting events in the world.  One thing that is not clear to me is why Apple has chosen to put its Olympics coverage in \u201cFor You\u201d.  I have two guesses. On the one hand, it will give a little more attention to the section: Apple has never detailed how much \u201cFor You\u201d is used compared to the rest of Apple News, but I\u2019m guessing what\u2019s at the top of the app is used the most when you first open it. On the other hand, the Olympics has mainstream interest and so putting Winter Olympics into the sports section might have meant that a wider range of users may never see it.

Pre-orders start tomorrow and you\u2019ll be able to buy it in Apple stores on Friday.  For iPhone X users, Apple is launching a dark red leather folio. Apple is also sharing some numbers about its partnership with (PRODUCT)RED.

The category has long been a lynchpin in Apple\u2019s strategy \u2014 something that Steve Jobs held near and dear.  Any \u201980s kid will tell you that Apple was a force to be reckoned with \u2014 Apple computers were mainstays in computer labs across the country. It\u2019s always been a good fit for a company focused on serving creators, bringing that extra bit of pizzazz to the classroom. In recent years, however, there\u2019s been a major shift. The Chromebook has become the king of the classroom, thanks in no small part to the inexpensive hardware and limited spec requirements.  Based on Google\u2019s early positioning of the category, it appears that the Chromebook\u2019s classroom success even managed to catch its creators off-guard. The company has since happily embraced that success \u2014 while Microsoft appears to have shifted its own approach in response to Chrome OS\u2019s success.  Apple\u2019s own responses have been less direct, and today\u2019s event was a reconfirmation of the company\u2019s commitment to the iPad as the centerpiece of its educational play. If Apple can be seen as reacting, it\u2019s in the price of the product. Gone are the days that schools\u2019 entire digital strategy revolved around a bunch of stationary desktops in a dusty old computer lab.  But while education has been a piece of the iPad strategy since the product launched eight years ago next month, the tablet was long price-prohibitive. The company has addressed that through school discounts and lowering the overall cost of the line, as the tablet market has started to stagnate, but the last couple of upgrades have dropped pricing down to a far more approachable $299.  A one-iPad-per-child approach is still out of the realm of plenty of public schools, but it\u2019s easy to see how the product could be appealing for school IT managers looking to roll out the iPad cart to classrooms. And additions like Managed Apple IDs have made it easier for multiple kids to share the same device, as a cost-cutting measure.  Along with devoted educational software, the company demonstrated how existing apps like Clips and Garage Band can be repurposed within the educational context to help bring a level of multimedia interactivity to the learning process. The company even sat us down in classrooms today to walk us through some of those projects.  Of course, right now, the market is Google\u2019s to lose. The company reportedly controls around 60 percent of the market. Much like Android, the heart of Chrome OS\u2019s approach is an embrace of third-party manufacturers, which have helped keep the cost down.  Schools with tight budgets can pick up a dirt-cheap Chromebook for $100-$150 less than an iPad. It\u2019s easy to see how that\u2019s an appealing proposition, especially when broken units are just par for the course in the hands of students.  In spite of its success, Google\u2019s certainly not an island. Yesterday\u2019s announcement of the first Chromebook tablet was both a response to Apple\u2019s involvement in the space and a preemptive strike against today\u2019s event, though the new Acer device is actually $30 more expensive than Apple\u2019s educational discount. The company sort of shot itself in the foot on that one, but expect to see more competitively priced slates from other hardware partners.  Microsoft held its own education event in May of last year, showing off its solution to Chrome OS. Thus far, however, Windows 10 S has been kind of a mess, thanks in no small part to some pretty convoluted messaging on the company\u2019s part. The company plans to streamline things a bit by making 10 S a mode inside of Windows 10.  The idea is basically the same, either way, offering a stripped-down version of the operating system that can be locked down from outside apps, so teachers can make sure nothing unseemly makes its way onto the device. It takes less of a toll on the hardware, with the company introducing a new line of PCs starting at $189 \u2014 a clear swipe at the Google\u2019s dominance.  In fact, the company came out and said as much in the accompanying press material, saying the products were \u201cthe same price as Chromebooks, with none of the compromises.\u201d And while Google\u2019s online office applications have grown in popularity, Microsoft software is still nearly ubiquitous in offices, so there\u2019s something to be said for prepping kids for the real world through use of such applications.", "stock": "AAPL"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/23/dining/pastry-chefs-architecture.html", "label": -1, "source": "the-new-york-times", "date": "2018-01-23", "article": "They include Ron Paprocki of Gotham Bar and Grill, a New York restaurant that since the 1980s has taken a structural approach to dishes, like its signature soaring chocolate cake; Rachel Gibeley of Rosebud American Kitchen & Bar in Boston, who oversees a celebrated pie program with creative flavors like grapefruit-caramel meringue; and Brandi Henderson, formerly of Delancey in Seattle, who now runs the adjacent cooking school and community kitchen, the Pantry.  Photo  The best known, though, is Dinara Kasko, a Ukrainian architect-turned-pastry chef who became an internet sensation last year for her sculptural, highly geometric desserts: a cherry cake made to look like shiny red bubbles encased in a cube, and a berry-almond tart with a mazelike surface, constructed with a mold made by a 3D printer.  The link between architecture and pastry dates back at least to 1815, when the renowned French chef Marie-Antoine Car\u00eame wrote \u201cLe Patissier Royal,\u201d a treatise that codified how architectural principles like drawing and planning could be applied in pastry. Chefs have long played with the structural possibilities of sugar, egg whites, flour and other ingredients.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  But today, architectural values and technology are shaping the new norms for dessert. And while the results are carefully plotted and constructed, they are not always towering or eye-popping. In fact, this new school of pastry chefs is trying to rescue the dessert course from the outlandish unicorn cakes and mile-high ice cream sundaes that saturate Instagram.  Photo  \u201cYou have all these photos of desserts covered in rainbows and sparkles, and they might taste like sawdust, but no one knows, because it looks great on social media,\u201d lamented Jansen Chan, a former architect who is now the director of pastry at the International Culinary Center in New York and the Bay Area. \u201cInstagram is a great way for pastry chefs to communicate, but there\u2019s also the danger of people walking away from great pastry just because it\u2019s not totally visually driven.\u201d  Why have he and other chefs made such a radical career shift? In interviews, several said they realized while working in architecture that pastry required a similar skill set, and they found baking a cake a lot more interesting \u2014 and immediately gratifying \u2014 than designing a building.  Ms. Yee, 39, always wanted to be a pastry chef, but went to architecture school to placate her parents, who wanted her to have what she calls \u201ca real job.\u201d She landed a position at the San Francisco design firm Georgina Rice & Co., where she assisted in designing interiors, mostly for high-end apartments.  Photo  Tired of having to abide by mundane building codes and regulations, and wanting something more creative, she began studying pastry in 2002 at Le Cordon Bleu in London, while working as a pastry assistant at the Connaught hotel for the chefs Gordon Ramsay and Angela Hartnett.  She found that her architectural training applied in the pastry kitchen as well. \u201cBeing an architect is not all about the structure,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the intent. How will this improve someone\u2019s life?\u201d  \u201cDesserts are also about thoughtfulness,\u201d she added. \u201cWhat are the ways I can manipulate this apple? What will highlight what\u2019s grown here? It\u2019s about looking at your environment and seeing what will be functional and beautiful in that space.\u201d  Photo  Consider the \u00e9clair, Ms. Yee\u2019s signature dessert when she was the pastry chef at the French restaurant Lafayette in New York from 2013 to 2016.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  \u00c9clairs are highly technical, she said, vulnerable to everything from the level of protein in the flour to the type of oven you are using. The pastry can easily come out overly dry, or completely lose its oblong shape when baked.  But precision, for her, is only one priority. \u201cI wanted some element of spontaneity and approachability,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I garnished them, I would make the glaze a little wonky on the side, or cut the fruit on top in a random way.\u201d  Photo  That attentiveness runs through the sweet creations of Lisa Lu, 49, who oversaw the pastry department at the landmark San Francisco restaurant Boulevard from 2012 to 2017, and is now a production manager at the chocolate company Recchiuti Confections. Two decades ago, as an interior architect, she worked on creative projects like the American Licorice Company corporate headquarters in Bend, Ore., and a mock-up for a shop for the sports apparel brand UltraNectar, in the Bay Area.  \u201cHaving studied architecture,\u201d she said, \u201cI can put together a plated dessert because I understand composition \u2014 the need for balance and a focal point.\u201d  The lime tart she used to serve at Boulevard, like Ms. Yee\u2019s apple strudel, looks nothing like what a diner might expect. Ms. Lu balances a marrow-bone-shaped pastry shell filled with a tangy lime curd and pomegranate seeds on a plate, piping toasted meringue all around the tart, \u201cso that if a server wasn\u2019t careful when transporting the dessert, it would still be intact by the time it got to the table.\u201d The meringue acts like mortar, sealing the tart into place and giving the dessert stability.  Photo  \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect example of balance,\u201d Ms. Lu said. \u201cThe shell, which is designed to be open enough to be able to pipe in a curd, is the focal point. The meringue is piped in a few key areas, and then the scattered pomegranate seeds draw your eye around the plate and connect the whole dessert together.\u201d  To pastry chefs who learned the craft the old-fashioned way and don\u2019t work in the world of high-end restaurants, that kind of talk can sound like an overly cerebral or pretentious way to describe something simple: the joy of creating something sweet.  Stella Parks, a senior editor at Serious Eats and the author of the classic American dessert cookbook \u201cBraveTart,\u201d sees some good in the architectural influence on pastry, noting that it has brought more rigor into the practice.  Photo  \u201cMy worry,\u201d she added, \u201cis always that the culinary element is being forgotten. I have had so many meals at high-end restaurants that were extremely memorable, but more like a trip to a modern art museum, where you would never want those kinds of things in your own home.\u201d  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Agatha Kulaga, a self-taught baker and a founder of the New York City bakery Ovenly, agreed; architectural ideals, she said, often leave out a vital element: nostalgia.  \u201cThe usefulness of an architecture background really depends on the end goal,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can have a dessert made by a pastry chef that feels like looking at a work of art \u2014 or you can have a dessert like a cookie or a slice of cake that doesn\u2019t necessarily feel like art, but creates an experience of joy.\u201d  Photo  But Baruch Ellsworth, the pastry chef at Canlis, in Seattle, who studied architecture at a California community college, said elements like taste and emotion are essential components of the architectural pastry practice. The difference is that they are incorporated more methodically.  Both pastry and architecture, he said, are an equation: \u201cA and B always have to equal C. You can tweak A and B lots of times, but it has to add up. You can\u2019t wing it.\u201d In other words, you can be as creative as you want in your choice of flavors of ingredients, but in the end, the dessert has to be something that people will want to eat, \u201cjust like when you make a building: you can do anything as long as it won\u2019t fall down.\u201d  One of his most popular desserts explores the kaleidoscopic, shape-shifting nature of chocolate. On a single plate, there\u2019s a tobacco-infused chocolate mousse, a Madagascar chocolate brownie, a milk chocolate crisp, a cocoa nib brittle, a caramel cream with caramelized white chocolate, and white chocolate streusel \u2014 all covered in a dehydrated layer of chocolate that elegantly drapes over each component like a silk sheet.  Photo  Mr. Ellsworth compared desserts like that to the Guggenheim Museum in New York. \u201cAt first, you\u2019re like, \u2018I can\u2019t believe this is a building,\u2019 because the outside looks like a tornado,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when you go inside, you realize it is quite functional.\u201d  At the International Culinary Center in California and New York, known for turning out acclaimed pastry chefs like Christina Tosi, of Milk Bar, and Melissa Weller, the founder of Sadelle\u2019s bakery in SoHo, architecture plays a significant role in the curriculum, thanks to Mr. Chan, 42, and his architectural background.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Since 2015, the second half of the school\u2019s six-month pastry program has incorporated lessons on sketching, making timelines and project planning. Mr. Chan added a chapter called \u201cElements of Design\u201d to the school\u2019s textbook; it teaches students about architectural principles like dynamism and scale in relation to dessert.  Photo  Mr. Chan said a number of students have recently come to the school from the architecture world. \u201cThey have a much easier time at adapting because they are used to being asked questions. They are better able to express their creative ideas,\u201d he said. \u201cPastry students with no design backgrounds will be the ones to draw a tall chocolate structure with nothing holding it up.\u201d  Mr. Chan has also introduced technology into pastry education \u2014 tools like lasers, which can be used to bake and pipe batter at the same time, and water-jet cutters, used by architects to slice through sheet metal and by large-scale patisseries and hotels for cutting cakes into precise, programmed shapes in the half the time it would take a person to complete.  Not everyone endorses this approach, though. \u201cArchitecture and pastry are both very human schools of thought,\u201d said Ms. Yee, who makes the un-strudel-like strudel. \u201cYou are always thinking about what people will like. This kind of technology, to me, dehumanizes food. You\u2019re taking away the personal aspect of cooking.\u201d  Some blame technology for the glorification of social-media oddities like clear pumpkin pie, or ice cream wrapped in a cloud of cotton candy.  Mr. Chan recalled encountering a red velvet cake at a bakery in Thailand on a recent trip.  \u201cIt resembled a red velvet cake,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it didn\u2019t have any cocoa. Someone had seen it online but didn\u2019t take the time to look up what, actually, is in a red velvet cake. That\u2019s the problem with social media. You lose context.

When news broke Monday that Mr. Giannandrea was unexpectedly stepping down as Google\u2019s A.I. chief, he immediately became perhaps the most eligible tech executive on the market. By Tuesday, it became clear he was never really on the market.  Apple has made other high-profile hires in the field, including the Carnegie Mellon professor Russ Salakhutdinov. Mr. Salakhutdinov studied at the University of Toronto under Geoffrey Hinton, who helps oversee the Google Brain lab.  Apple has taken a strong stance on protecting the privacy of people who use its devices and online services, which could put it at a disadvantage when building services using neural networks.  Researchers train these systems by pooling enormous amounts of digital data, sometimes from customer services. Apple, however, has said it is developing methods that would allow it to train these algorithms without compromising privacy.  On the debate over whether humanity should be worried about the rapidly accelerating improvements in A.I., Mr. Giannandrea told MIT Technology Review in an interview last year that the concerns were overblown.  \u201cWhat I object to is this assumption that we will leap to some kind of superintelligent system that will then make humans obsolete,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand why people are concerned about it but I think it\u2019s gotten way too much airtime.

Baird & Company, wrote in a research report.  While Amazon\u2019s online store sales grew 20 percent from a year earlier, the company\u2019s total retail growth benefited from its acquisition of Whole Foods Markets. That deal, announced in June, added much of the $4.52 billion in physical store revenue for the quarter.  Yet the biggest revenue growth came from a category generically named \u201cother,\u201d which includes advertising services and rose 62 percent to $1.74 billion from a year earlier.  By far the most profitable big business for the company was Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing unit. Its revenue rose 45 percent to $5.11 billion, and its operating income increased 46 percent to $1.35 billion.  Amazon kept with its tradition of secrecy by refusing to reveal exactly how many of its Echo family of devices it sold, saying only that it sold \u201ctens of millions\u201d of them last year. The company priced the devices aggressively over the holidays \u2014 its cheapest was only $29. The devices probably did not yield much profit, though they are an important part of Amazon\u2019s effort to establish a technology ecosystem that could result in other benefits, such as enabling customers to make impulse purchases with their voices.  Photo  Apple, in contrast, is without equal in making profits from tech hardware.  For the company\u2019s fiscal first quarter, it reported a record for quarterly net income \u2014 $20.07 billion, up 12 percent from a year earlier. Revenue rose 13 percent to $88.3 billion. The gains were notable considering that Apple\u2019s fiscal first quarter was a week shorter than the previous year\u2019s 14-week fiscal first quarter.  While Amazon is content to price its devices near its costs for making them, Apple is known for charging a premium for its smartphones, tablets and computers. The iPhone X, which uses facial recognition to unlock the device, is the most expensive in its history, starting at almost $1,000.

Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said on the company\u2019s earnings call.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Mr. Cook noted that the iPhone X was the company\u2019s top-selling phone in the quarter despite its November release, roughly a month and a half after Apple\u2019s other new iPhones.  The company sold 77.3 million iPhones over the quarter, which was down 1 percent from the longer quarter a year earlier. Yet revenue was higher largely because of the pricing of the new iPhones: In addition to introducing the iPhone X, Apple raised the price of the base model of its iPhone to $699, up from the $649 starting price for past iPhones.  Sales in its \u201cother products\u201d category, which includes the Apple Watch, grew 36 percent to $5.5 billion. Apple declined to disclose sales of the Apple Watch for competitive reasons, but Mr. Cook noted on the earnings call that revenue for the Apple Watch had grown 50 percent.  Apple also highlighted money generated from services, which include the App Store and Apple Music, with revenue rising 18 percent to $8.5 billion. Apple said the App Store continued to be the top destination for smartphone customers to buy apps.  Apple sold 13.2 million iPads, up 1 percent \u2014 notable because iPad sales declined for many consecutive quarters over the last few years. But Mac sales shrank about 5 percent to 5.1 million units.  Despite strong sales of the pricey iPhone X, some analysts remained concerned that its sales were slowing. Ahead of the earnings call, some news reports said Apple was slashing production of the iPhone X for the quarter that ends in March. The reports cited supply chain partners that said Apple had cut orders for parts.  But in years past, Apple has warned investors that activities of its complex supply chain were an unreliable metric for overall sales. The company also typically slows down iPhone production after the holiday quarter, which is the peak shopping season.  Last month, Apple also unveiled plans to bring the vast majority of its $252 billion in cash held abroad back to the United States, paying a one-time repatriation tax of $38 billion. Because the company had already earmarked $36.4 billion in anticipation that it would eventually have to pay taxes on its foreign earnings, Apple did not see much impact from the recent tax code changes.

But even if that definition feels overly broad, the findings reveal just how ubiquitous certain products have become in American life.

The feature is to become part of Apple\u2019s popular Health app. It will enable users to transfer clinical data \u2014 like cholesterol levels and lists of medications prescribed by their doctors \u2014 directly from their medical providers to their iPhones, potentially streamlining how Americans gain access to some health information.  A dozen medical institutions across the United States \u2014 including Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore and Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles \u2014 have agreed to participate in the beta version of the new feature. Apple plans to open the beta test to consumers on Thursday.

Broadcom typically slashes costs, especially research and development, and the company said it would do exactly that if it acquired Qualcomm. \u201cIn the long run that\u2019s not good for the country or for society,\u201d Mr. Dodson said.  He agreed with the Trump administration\u2019s assessment that, by cutting Qualcomm\u2019s research costs, Broadcom would be assisting Chinese rivals in the global race for dominance in 5G communications technology.  But as an investor, his reasoning can pretty much be reduced to one word: Apple.  Apple has traditionally been one of Qualcomm\u2019s biggest customers, along with Samsung and every other major handset company. But the two technology giants are also embroiled in an epic battle over licensing fees for Qualcomm\u2019s patented technology, with profound implications not only for Qualcomm\u2019s business model and Apple\u2019s profit margins, but for the future of wireless communication.  Photo  If Qualcomm and Apple can just bury the hatchet, Mr. Dodson reasons, Qualcomm\u2019s revenues would soar, and its stock price would climb well past Broadcom\u2019s offering price of $79 a share. By Mr. Dodson\u2019s reckoning, once Apple resumes paying Qualcomm, the chip maker will be worth at least $84 a share, \u201cwhich is why Broadcom\u2019s offer didn\u2019t really engage my attention,\u201d he said.  That, however, is a big \u201cif,\u201d given the intractable positions both sides have staked out.  At the heart of the dispute is the way Qualcomm calculates the licensing fee it charges customers, which is a percentage of the cost of the net selling price of the entire handset \u2014 and not the price of the chip. That means that Apple, a high-cost producer whose iPhone X sells for as much as $1,000, has paid much higher licensing fees than low-cost competitors using exactly the same chip set.  Apple has called the arrangement an \u201cextortion scheme.\u201d It infuriates Apple that Qualcomm has, in effect, been subsidizing its low-cost competitors, including the very Chinese companies that Mr. Trump says he is so concerned about.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Qualcomm has countered that its intellectual property makes many of the iPhones\u2019 distinctive features possible, features that low-cost competitors haven\u2019t replicated, and therefore Qualcomm deserves a percentage of the cost of the entire device.  Mr. Dodson made little immediate headway when he met with a delegation of top Qualcomm officials late last month and pressed his case for a settlement with Apple. The officials, including the chief executive, Steve Mollenkopf, and Paul Jacobs, a Qualcomm founder and, until recently, executive chairman, visited Mr. Dodson in San Francisco to make their case against the Broadcom bid.  In Mr. Dodson\u2019s account of the meeting, he urged the Qualcomm executives to settle with Apple rather than risk alienating it as a customer over the long term. But Qualcomm officials said that Apple was demanding more than they were prepared to give and that, on an engineering level, relations with Apple remained good. They assured him that eventually they would reach a settlement, revenues would normalize and Qualcomm stock would respond.

Still, \u201cI\u2019d like to see them budge\u201d on the licensing issue, Mr. Dodson said. \u201cI can see Apple\u2019s point.\u201d  But if Qualcomm stopped charging Apple a percentage of the device\u2019s cost, it would probably have to extend similar terms to all its major customers. It recently amended its agreement with Samsung without abandoning its approach to license fees. At the meeting, Qualcomm officials told Mr. Dodson they offered Apple similar terms, but Apple rejected them.  A Qualcomm spokeswoman declined to comment, as did an Apple spokeswoman.  Long-simmering tensions between Qualcomm and Apple reached a boiling point in 2016, when Qualcomm halted rebates it was giving Apple. Qualcomm claimed Apple had violated the terms of the rebate agreement by cooperating with South Korea\u2019s investigation into what Samsung and others said was exclusionary conduct by Qualcomm. Apple responded by withholding the license fees it paid manufacturers of iPhones, who in turn stopped passing on the payments to Qualcomm.  Photo  Lawsuits and counterclaims erupted, and Qualcomm reduced its revenue estimates by $500 million a year.  While Apple has continued to buy and deploy the latest Qualcomm chips, it also reached out to a rival chip maker, Intel, which began supplying an alternative to Qualcomm\u2019s chip for the iPhone 7. (That phone, the iPhone 8 and the X may contain either a Qualcomm or an Intel chip.)  Qualcomm claims that Apple has compromised the performance of Qualcomm-equipped handsets in order to mask their superiority over the Intel-equipped phones. (Both Intel and Apple have vehemently denied the claims.)  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Numerous lawsuits are now well underway in the United States, with some expected to go to trial later this year. Regulators in the European Union, Taiwan, South Korea and China have ruled that Qualcomm\u2019s licensing practices are unlawful and have levied fines, decisions that Qualcomm is appealing. In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission is conducting its own investigation.  While armies of patent lawyers fight over the rival claims, investors have already rendered a verdict. Qualcomm shares, after peaking at more than $80 in 2014, dropped by nearly 50 percent, hitting a low of $44 in 2016.  Qualcomm\u2019s precipitous decline is what attracted Mr. Dodson\u2019s attention along with other so-called value investors, who look for stocks trading below their intrinsic value. He said his fund\u2019s average cost per share for its Qualcomm position was about $56, so the fund was still ahead even after the deal collapsed this week. On Thursday, Qualcomm was trading at around $60.  Still, Qualcomm\u2019s performance has knocked the Endeavor fund from its perch at the top of the Morningstar rankings. So far this year, it\u2019s 61st.  Now that Mr. Trump has rescued Qualcomm from the imminent threat of a Broadcom takeover, its financial prospects \u2014 and share price \u2014 will largely follow the twists and turns in the Apple standoff. While Mr. Dodson remains optimistic about the outcome, that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s against all potential takeovers of Qualcomm.  Last week, there were rumors that Intel might launch a bid for Broadcom, which made Mr. Dodson wonder: \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t it bid for Qualcomm? If Intel bought it, Qualcomm would be in good hands.\u201d  \u201cAs a citizen, I\u2019d be very comfortable with that,\u201d he said.", "stock": "AAPL"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/01/business/boycott-facebook-apple-google-failed.html", "label": 1, "source": "the-new-york-times", "date": "2018-04-01", "article": "Ms. Cunningham, who has freelanced for The New York Times, added that she had immediately begun missing Facebook as a research tool for her documentaries. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can get out of the ecosystem,\u201d she said.  People looking to punish major tech companies by abstaining from their products have been bedeviled time and again by the difficulty in escaping them. After Google fired an engineer, James Damore, for criticizing the company\u2019s diversity efforts last year, hundreds of people on social media called for a boycott of the company. But an analysis of nearly 7,000 tweets using the hashtag #BoycottGoogle since August showed that 26 percent of the tweets came from devices using Google\u2019s Android software, according to Keyhole, a social-media research firm.  One Twitter account named Milton Prescott tweeted on Aug. 8: \u201cGoogle\u2019s firing of James Damore proves his point completely. I will no longer be using Google for any services. #BoycottGoogle.\u201d The tweet came from an Android device. A message to the account went unreturned.  Even Breitbart is running into the same dilemma. The conservative website is planning to host a panel on how tech platforms like Facebook suppress conservative voices \u2014 and it said it would livestream the discussion on Facebook. Breitbart didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.  Marisa Richardson, a program manager at a life-sciences company, said she began boycotting Amazon recently after learning that it offered the NRA channel on its streaming-video service. So when she needed laundry detergent, she avoided the e-commerce site and instead braved the crowds and traffic \u2014 and spent a few dollars more \u2014 at a nearby Target.  But a few days later she shopped at the Whole Foods near her home in Oakland, Calif. \u201cI completely forgot that they\u2019re owned by Amazon,\u201d she said.  After the shooting in Parkland in February, gun-control activists called for a boycott of certain Apple and Amazon services because they hosted the NRA channel.  Photo  People used the hashtag #March1NRABoycott to spread the message on social media. An analysis of about 58,500 tweets with the hashtag showed that nearly half came from an iPhone or an iPad, according to Keyhole. Those included popular tweets using the #March1NRABoycott hashtag from the actress Alyssa Milano.  \u201cHad I sent the same tweets from an Android phone, the same issue would apply. There is an NRATV app for Android phones,\u201d Ms. Milano said through a spokeswoman. \u201cWe are only just beginning to understand how these companies have infiltrated not only our ideologies, but also our lives in the most in-depth way imaginable.\u201d  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Nearly a third of the 4,700 tweets using the #BoycottApple hashtag since August came from iPhones, according to Keyhole.  \u201cI do have an iPhone, but as a customer of Apple\u2019s, am I not allowed to hold them accountable?\u201d Mr. Knight, the activist who used an iPhone to call for an Apple boycott, said in an interview.

So who\u2019s left?  The same company that always seems to turn up when it\u2019s time to cross into a new era of technology: Apple.  I got to thinking about Apple\u2019s responsibility last week when two large investors wrote an open letter asking the company to do more about its products\u2019 effects on children. I was initially inclined to dismiss the letter as a publicity stunt; if you\u2019re worried about children and tech, why not go after Facebook?  But when I called several experts, I found they agreed with the investors. Sure, they said, Apple isn\u2019t responsible for the excesses of the digital ad business, but it does have a moral responsibility to \u2014 and a business interest in \u2014 the well-being of its customers.  And there\u2019s another, more important reason for Apple to take on tech addiction: because it would probably do an elegant job of addressing the problem.  \u201cI do think this is their time to step up,\u201d said Tristan Harris, a former design ethicist at Google who now runs Time Well Spent, an organization working to improve technology\u2019s impact on society.  \u201cIn fact,\u201d Mr. Harris added, \u201cthey may be our only hope.\u201d  For one thing, Apple\u2019s business model does not depend on tech addiction. The company makes most of its money by selling premium devices at high profit margins. Yes, it needs to make sure you find your phone useful enough to buy the next one, but after you purchase your phone and sign up for some of its premium services, Apple doesn\u2019t really need you to overdo it. Indeed, because it can\u2019t make infinite battery life, Apple would probably be O.K. if you cooled it with your phone a little.

Every tech company needs a presence on the iPhone or iPad; this means that Apple can set the rules for everyone. With a single update to its operating system and its app store, Apple could curb some of the worst excesses in how apps monitor and notify you to keep you hooked (as it has done, for instance, by allowing ad blockers in its mobile devices). And because other smartphone makers tend to copy Apple\u2019s best inventions, whatever it did to curb our dependence on our phones would be widely emulated.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Mr. Harris suggested several ideas for Apple to make a less-addictive smartphone. For starters, Apple could give people a lot more feedback about how they\u2019re using their devices.  Imagine if, once a week, your phone gave you a report on how you spent your time, similar to how your activity tracker tells you how sedentary you were last week. It could also needle you: \u201cFarhad, you spent half your week scrolling through Twitter. Do you really feel proud of that?\u201d It could offer to help: \u201cIf I notice you spending too much time on Snapchat next week, would you like me to remind you?\u201d  Another idea is to let you impose more fine-grained controls over notifications. Today, when you let an app send you mobile alerts, it\u2019s usually an all-or-nothing proposition \u2014 you say yes to letting it buzz you, and suddenly it\u2019s buzzing you all the time.  Mr. Harris suggested that Apple could require apps to assign a kind of priority level to their notifications. \u201cLet\u2019s say you had three notification levels \u2014 heavy users, regular users and lite, or Zen,\u201d Mr. Harris said.  Apple could set rules for what kind of notifications were allowed in each bucket \u2014 for instance, the medium bucket might allow notifications generated by other people (like a direct message in Instagram) but not those from the app itself (Instagram just sending you an alert to remind you that your high school friend\u2019s mom\u2019s brother posted a new picture recently).  \u201cAnd then Apple could say, by default, everyone is in the middle level \u2014 and instantly it could save a ton of users a ton of energy in dealing with this,\u201d Mr. Harris said.  There\u2019s a danger that some of these anti-addiction efforts could get too intrusive. But that\u2019s also why Apple would shine here; building a less-addictive phone is chiefly a problem of interface design, which is basically Apple\u2019s entire corporate raison d\u2019\u00eatre.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Another thing that Apple is good at is marketing, and I suspect it could make a lot of gauzy ads showing people getting more out of iPhones and iPads by unplugging from them for a little while. Note that it already sells a device, the Apple Watch, whose marketing extols the magic of leaving your phone behind.  Done right, a full-fledged campaign pushing the benefits of a more deliberative approach to tech wouldn\u2019t come off as self-interest, but in keeping with Apple\u2019s best vision of itself \u2014 as a company that looks out for the interests of humanity in an otherwise cold and sometimes inhumane industry.  \u201cHow we live with technology is the cultural issue of the next half-century,\u201d said James Steyer, the founder and chief executive of Common Sense Media, a nonprofit group that studies how children are affected by media.  He suggested that the feeling was ripe for Apple to tap into. \u201cIt\u2019s something that everyone cares about \u2014 whether you\u2019re a Republican or a Democrat, liberal or conservative, whether you live in San Francisco or Biloxi, Miss., you know that you and your kids are part of the arms race for attention,\u201d he said.  Apple released a statement last week saying it cared deeply \u201cabout how our products are used and the impact they have on users and the people around them,\u201d adding that it had a few features on addiction in the works.  Apple hardly ever talks about future products, so it declined to elaborate on any of its ideas when I called. Let\u2019s hope it\u2019s working on something grand.", "stock": "AAPL"}, {"url": "http://www.techradar.com/reviews/apple-homepod-review", "label": 1, "source": "techradar", "date": "2018-02-12", "article": "With the HomePod, we're really reviewing two things at once: a premium speaker and a smart home hub. In the former category, the HomePod is excellent, with amazing sound and incredibly intuitive set-up. But in the latter Siri is only middling in its implementation, and the fact that you're not able to break out of the Apple ecosystem for many key functions also rankles.  Apple\u2019s devices have evolved hugely over the last 15 years or so, changing the brand from the rebooted upstart that gave us the iPod to the consumer tech powerhouse of today.  The HomePod takes the name of that iconic portable device, but a decade and a half on we're faced with the same question posed by previous Apple gadgets: how much of a premium should you pay for owning a device that fits seamlessly into the Apple ecosystem?  Let's not forget that the HomePod is a late entry to the smart speaker game, but that\u2019s standard operating procedure for the Cupertino-based brand: let the rest of the industry stride ahead with a new form factor, identify the issues and then offer something that \u2018just works\u2019... and generally for a higher price than the competition.  That\u2019s what\u2019s happened with the HomePod, although not in quite the same way as before. There\u2019s no denying that the sound quality of Apple\u2019s speaker is top-notch, but in a marketplace where Amazon has such an entrenched smart speaker/voice assistant ecosystem and Google isn\u2019t far behind, can a great-sounding-but-imperfect device be worth buying?  The HomePod is understated in the house.  As intimated, the HomePod price isn't a cheap speaker \u2013 the price is a weighty $349 / \u00a3319 / AU$499, and the speaker began shipping on February 9 in selected territories.  That makes it one of the most expensive smart speakers on the market \u2013 and certainly the most expensive mainstream option \u2013 but Apple is hoping to justify that price by embedding Siri inside and offering premium-quality audio.  Set-up  By far the easiest smart speaker to set up  Capable of reading own surroundings  It's a heavy box to bring home...  The Apple HomePod is so, well, Apple in the way you\u2019ll use it. As with the AirPods, simply hold your phone near the unit and your handset will send over your Apple ID and Apple Music preferences, and fill in all the long-winded Wi-Fi passwords that you\u2019re proud you remember but thankfully don\u2019t have to type in.  The set-up process was only delayed for us by the fact that we needed to upgrade to iOS 11.2.5 on our iPhone, which is a prerequisite for making the speaker work.  That highlights one key thing about the HomePod: you\u2019ll need to have an iPhone or iPad to set it up in the first place.  It\u2019s hard to see why you\u2019d buy this speaker without owning one of those already, but it trims the target audience down right from the outset.  The speaker glows pleasantly during setup  However, the set-up process does highlight one of the nice features of the HomePod: the glowing light on the top (which turns into the multi-colored Siri logo when you\u2019re issuing commands to it later on).  The whole process is so swift though \u2013 compare it to the long-long-long-winded set-up process for the Amazon Echo or Sonos One \u2013 and you\u2019ll be so glad that you don't have to spend a minute wafting your iPhone around the room to calibrate the sound levels.  Holding your phone near the speaker calls up this box  Add to that further such conveniences in day-to-day use \u2013 if you need to use a new Wi-Fi network that's already set up on your phone, you just literally hold the phone nearby and it's done \u2013 and you can see how Apple has smashed the competition when it comes to ease of use, one of its real hallmarks.  The HomePod will actually just work out where it is within the room simply by playing some music \u2013 it\u2019ll assess its physical surroundings by hearing how the sound it emits bounces around, and if there\u2019s a wall behind it will send certain sections of what you\u2019re listening to that way, while the main vocals or instruments will fire forwards.  Seven steps and the speaker is ready to go.  If it's not adjacent to a wall then the HomePod will chuck the sound out in a 360-degree space, although in most cases we\u2019d imagine people would use the speaker up against a wall.  After that\u2019s all set up, you can leave the house with your iPhone and your family or housemates will still be able to use the speaker, although you can turn off \u2018personal requests\u2019 based on your information if you don\u2019t want other people meddling with your business.  (Thankfully you can also stop requests to the speaker messing with your music listening history \u2013 if you\u2019re trying to build decent automated playlists on Apple Music, your housemates playing Justin Bieber and Moana on repeat won\u2019t ruin everything.)  Design  Understated design  Much heavier than expected  If you\u2019re thinking of picking up the HomePod you may want to go with both hands to start with. That\u2019s because this speaker is incredibly dense, packing 2.5kg of weight into its 172mm (6.8-inch) high frame.  It feels a good deal heavier than it looks, and that\u2019s because there are so many speakers in there. We\u2019re talking a woofer and seven tweeters, each with its own amplifier, and six microphones spread around to help pick up your voice when you're hailing Siri.  And once its placement is locked in, you\u2019ll need to answer one more question: how are you going to run the power lead that comes out the back? It\u2019s the only wire on this device, and the only thing that resembles a port too. There\u2019s no other physical connectivity on offer, which sadly means no aux-in port for connecting up a record player or other device.  We do not recommend placing your HomePod in front of a fire for any length of time.  All you\u2019ve got is a squat little speaker covered in an \u2018acoustic mesh\u2019 that\u2019s designed to protect the device while letting out as much sound as possible. It looks as unremarkable as you\u2019d expect \u2013 there are no decorative flourishes here \u2013 and the only break in the mesh is on the top, where a round, reflective disc sits.  This is, as we've mentioned, where the glowing light pulses, signifying when Siri is listening and processing commands, and it's also where you'll find the plus and minus icons for adjusting the volume.  Pushing the speaker against a wall brings the best audio performance.  It\u2019s a shame there\u2019s no haptic feedback from the buttons, but given that most of the time you\u2019re going to be controlling the HomePod with your voice it's not a big deal.  The HomePod isn't the most aesthetically pleasing speaker out there, but it's attractive in its simplicity. Some might think that, for the price, it should be more striking, but the speaker is certainly well-made.  And be warned - the Apple HomePod can leave a white ring underneath if you leave it on certain surfaces (mostly more expensive, porous wood). Apple has acknowledged this and says it should wipe off, or disappear after a few days, but other claims state that it can leave a more permanent ring. Either way, think about where you place the speaker, as the vibration causes a reaction between the silicon base to the wood thanks to the deeper bass.  We had our speaker on a wooden surface in our testing, but it was a thinner (well, cheaper) wood, and found no example of the staining... but it seems that more porous, expensive veneers are those in danger.  In terms of processing, the HomePod is equipped with Apple\u2019s A8 chip, created to be used in the iPhone 6 from 2015. That may sound a little old, but given that it was designed to power a whole smartphone, it\u2019s actually quite a lot of power for \u2018only\u2019 a speaker, even one that\u2019s sending and receiving commands to and from the cloud on a regular basis.  Audio performance  Sublime audio performance  No Bluetooth streaming or aux input  The audio quality of the Apple HomePod is, to put it simply, premium. It fills a room easily, with clear separation between all elements of music tracks.  It's certainly at its best when placed against a wall, pulling apart the sounds well, with elements such as voices coming through with incredible breadth.  We're probably all used to hearing music of various quality throughout our day, from poor-quality headphones to whatever speakers our TV has, so using the HomePod will expose a lot of people who aren't audiophiles to new subtleties in music which they may not have heard before.  You can ask Siri to read the news or a message out when in the kitchen if you've got your hands full.  The bass, in particular, is strong, but like most sounds emanating from the speaker the audio is stable, with sharp notes clipping very well. Listening to electronica, in particular, offered a lot of clarity, while bass guitar sounds brought a slight reverberation to the sound \u2013 those with an untrained ear in particular will be blown away.  But it's the fusion of all this that's impressive \u2013 being able to hear thudding bass (a teeny bit too thudding at times, it has to be said) while at the same time being treated to crystal-clear vocals on top is a lovely experience.  Sometimes you'll feel that things can get a little mixed together \u2013 bass guitar can be a touch muddy, or something like a violin can be easily overpowered \u2013 but compared to a cheap, low-end speaker the quality is just miles and miles ahead.  The HomePod is loud too, with Siri asking if you definitely want to do that when you ask the speaker to play at full volume. And if there are any sound effects on a track, be it water splashing, rain or a faux-vinyl sound, the crispness again is amazing.  In fact, the audio quality is so good that the biggest criticism we can level at the audio capabilities of the speaker is how you interact with it. Saying \u2018Hey Siri\u2019 over and over to achieve anything irks, and if you\u2019re in a room with multiple people talking you\u2019ll need others to shush otherwise their words are easily picked up, leading to random songs being played.  The base of the speaker is on the only place you'll find an Apple logo  It would be nice to somehow have your intentions registered without the need for a key phrase.  Comparing the HomePod to the new Amazon Echo and the Sonos One, though, it bests both of them easily. Leaving aside the simple set-up, which is a godsend, the sound from Apple's speaker is the most expansive and clear... it just feels like there's more information flooding into your ears.  The Amazon Echo is obviously the lowest-quality of the three in terms of sound quality, but it's not terrible. Listen to it in isolation and you'll like how it sounds, especially for the price. But the HomePod just destroys it with the level of audio on offer, making music sound, well, 'proper'.  The Sonos One is understandably much closer to the HomePod when it comes to audio performance, but it's not quite as good \u2013 the only way we can describe it is as being 'narrower' in its sound, with the volume and breadth of the audio not matching Apple's efforts.  That's not to say the Sonos One's sound quality isn't hugely clear and evocative \u2013 it thoroughly is \u2013 but there's just more power and depth from the HomePod.  But now we get onto how you actually listen to things on the HomePod, and therein lies the rub. You need a subscription to Apple Music unless you just want to stream stuff from your iPhone \u2013 and even that can only be done using AirPlay.  We say 'only' because you can't stream over Bluetooth to the HomePod. That's not a massive issue if you'll only ever want to play audio from an Apple product, but if you've got something else that can be used to stream Bluetooth music you're out of luck.  Similarly, with no aux input you won't be able to use the premium sound of the HomePod to play your CDs, or your vinyl collection if you've jumped on that particular bandwagon.  We can see the argument for not offering Bluetooth streaming \u2013 despite there being a Bluetooth connection on board to enable the HomePod to talk to other smart home devices \u2013 but not having an aux input is a missed opportunity.  So, given the above, how are you supposed to get the most out of your HomePod? With the aforementioned Apple Music \u2013 meaning you're essentially going to need to pay $10 / \u00a310 a month to keep using your new speaker.  You'll barely use the volume buttons on the top of the speaker.  If you're already paying that, no problem \u2013 but if you're currently a Spotify user you won't be able to use that service without streaming it over your phone, which isn't ideal \u2013 you can still control the music using your voice in this mode, but it's a lot slower to respond.  The fact that you're pretty much locked to Apple Music makes it all the more curious that Apple doesn't have a lossless format, like Tidal, given that the HomePod is tailored for such high-end sound.  Perhaps that's coming in the future. Or perhaps Apple thinks the sound is good enough with what's there \u2013 and as we've said, it is great.  But the fact that you can only use Apple Music rankles, further highlighting how you need to be deeply embedded in the Apple ecosystem to get proper use out of the HomePod.  Speaking of the future, when Apple debuts AirPlay 2 later in the year you\u2019ll be able to link two HomePods together to get stereo sound. We had a brief demo of this, and it sounds, well, pretty much like two speakers making more noise together. The quality was equally as high, just more spread out and that sounded better.  With AirPlay 2 you\u2019ll also be able to spread your sound to other speakers \u2013 not just HomePods \u2013 and other AirPlay 2-enabled devices around the house.  We tried it with the Apple TV, and while the sound was brilliant we had to dive into the settings every time to tell the TV to play the sound through the speaker. Having two HomePods proudly sitting either side of the screen and automatically playing the audio from Netflix or whatever would be great.", "stock": "AAPL"}, {"url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/apple-iphone-x-available-with-a-minimum-buyback-of-rs-20000-and-free-screen-replacement", "label": 1, "source": "techradar", "date": "2018-02-26", "article": "There's a new limited period offer for the iPhone X buyers.

On a support page detailing the \u2018feature\u2019, Apple has confirmed that \u201cThis power management feature is specific to iPhone and does not apply to any other Apple products.\u201d  So why is the iPhone affected and nothing else? Well, we don\u2019t know for sure, but Apple is slowing older phones down to stop them unexpectedly shutting down, which can happen during performance peaks when the battery is older or at a low state of charge.  Bigger is better  GSMArena notes that as iPads have larger batteries than iPhones they\u2019ll be better able to handle performance peaks, and they also tend to be charged less frequently than a phone, which means their batteries don\u2019t wear out as quickly, all of which means that slowing them down should be less necessary. The same should also apply to MacBooks.  The Apple Watch, with its tiny battery, would presumably be susceptible to the same issues as an iPhone, especially since the battery could wear out similarly fast thanks to the regular charges it\u2019s likely to get, but nonetheless Apple won\u2019t throttle it \u2013 at least for now.  There\u2019s no guarantee that the company won\u2019t start slowing down other devices in future though, with the iPhone X, iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus \u2013 all of which are currently too new to need slowing down \u2013 likely to be next in line.", "stock": "AAPL"}, {"url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/apple-2018-announcements", "label": 0, "source": "techradar", "date": "2018-03-28", "article": "Apple's sole focus at today's education event in Chicago was on the new iPad 2018 and the specialized iOS software and accessories it can run. It didn't deviate much.  That's okay. It just means there's another Apple event to come, with the next one being Apple WWDC 2018 on June 4. We expect a lot of newness there \u2013 and at the next iPhone event likely in September \u2013 that we didn't see today.  Specifically, in 2018, we're anticipating new Mac computers, new mobile devices, new wireless accessories, and new software for all of your Apple-made technology.  Here's everything Apple still has to announce this year.  1. The new MacBook Air  A new MacBook Air would have been a great addition to Apple's education event, but it would have also instantly distracted from the new iPad 2018. That's why we feel as though the company's entry-level computer may debut at WWDC instead.  Apple's affordable 13.3-inch laptop is expected to get a refresh, with modern specs (the current Air is stuck at a 5th generation Intel Core i5 and Core i7 processors; other laptops are up to 8th gen) and finally bump the screen resolution up to Retina.  2. AirPower wireless charger  It's not hard to find wireless chargers, but Qi chargers that can recharge multiple devices are a rather new thing. We're seeing a few come onto the scene now, including Lxory Dual Wireless Charging Pad and, soon, the Belkin Boost Up Dual Wireless Charging Pad.  That's all the more why Apple should be weeks away from finally launching the AirPower charging pad it previewed at the iPhone X launch event last year. It can charge up to three devices at once, including an iPhone (iPhone X, iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus so far), an Apple Watch, and the new AirPods case.  3. AirPods 2 with wireless charging  Going along with the AirPower charging pad, if you really want to wireless charge your AirPods, you're going to need the new AirPods wireless charging case. Whether or not Apple calls this AirPods 2 remains a big mystery, but it's definitely going to be a new iteration.  We expect Apple to start selling the new AirPods with and without the untethered EarPods. The latter option is ideal for all of the current AirPods owners who just want the wireless case without the extra expense.  Previous news: Apple AirPods 2 and 3 could be coming in 2018 and 2019  4. iPad Pro with Face ID  Apple's education event wasn't the last we've heard from the iPad in 2018, according to the most recent rumors. We also expect a redesigned iPad Pro before the end of this year.  It was too soon to launch a new iPad Pro today \u2013 we just got the iPad 10.5 and iPad 12.9 tablets at WWDC last year. We're thinking Apple may be ready for a new set of slates at a September iPhone launch event. That's much better timing. New features could include a TrueDepth camera for Face ID and Animoji, and less bezel. Hopefully that makes the bigger 12.9-inch iPad Pro body smaller without actually reducing the screen size.  5. Mac Pro 2018  Apple promised that we'd get a new Mac Pro by the end of 2018, and it's previously teased the new rig as an 'upgradeable\u2019 and \u2018modular\u2019 desktop computer.  This isn't a rumor. Apple called it \"a completely redesigned, next-generation Mac Pro architected for pro customers who need the highest performance, high-throughput system in a modular, upgradeable design.\" That's a big change in direction since the trash can design of the Mac Pro 2013 didn't offer much in the way of upgradeable space. Apple had admitted as much and is out to change that with the new Mac Pro 2018.  6. iPhone XI, iPhone XI and cheaper iPhone  Apple skipped over the iPhone 7S name and we're not sure what's happening with the iPhone 9 moniker. But we fully expect there to be a new iPhone X this year, and it could be called the iPhone XI or iPhone X2. Whatever the name is, expect it to be rather iterative with the same 5.8-inch screen.  The true standouts of 2018 will be a larger iPhone XI, rumored to have a 6.5-inch AMOLED screen, and also cheaper iPhone X with a 6.1-inch LCD at a less intimidating price. The latter option could be Apple's next-generation take on an iPhone SE.  7. Apple Watch 4  The Apple Watch 4 may finally give us a redesign to Apple's iPhone-compatible smartwatch \u2013 the first new look since the original Apple Watch launched in 2015.  It'll have a 15% larger screen and more battery life, according to the most recent report by one noted Apple analyst. That doesn't mean the body will be 15% larger, thankfully. The current Apple Watch 3 (and all Watch models) have bezel to spare. And more battery life could allow Apple to issue its own sleep tracking software, too.  8. New software  The real star every year at Apple's WWDC keynote is software. It's why Apple app developers show up to the San Jose event \u2013 to make good app you'll download.  This year, we expect to see iOS 12 with fewer new features in favor of more stability and allow iOS apps to run on macOS computers. Ideas like a home screen redesign and default app revisions may be saved for iOS 13. Going along with this, we expect to see macOS 10.14, watchOS 5, and tvOS 12 at WWDC, too.", "stock": "AAPL"}, {"url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/cheap-apple-watch-deals", "label": -1, "source": "techradar", "date": "2018-03-14", "article": "Finding the best cheap Apple Watch deals is no easy task simply because this is the newest product category among Apple devices and the Apple Watch 3 version with LTE is is still new and expensive.  Our best tip for April 2018 is to ditch the LTE - as the standard Apple Watch 3 has all of the top features of the new watch without the expensive connection - or just go for the still-excellent Apple Watch 2. There's a lot of money savings to be had.  Yes, the Apple Watch 3 is the best Apple Watch you can buy today; however, the refreshed Apple Watch Series 1 or 2 are just as good for most people. Make sure you pick wisely.  Here\u2019s a list of the best Apple Watch deals for April 2018, from the first version of the Watch to the latest. We also threw in a few places to buy cheap Apple Watch bands a little more cheaply than you can pick them up from Apple.  Apple Watch Series 3  A modest - but impressive - upgrade  OS: watchOS 4 | Compatibility: iOS | Display: 1.65\" OLED | Processor: S3 dual-core | Onboard storage: 8GB | Battery: 18 hours | Charging method: Wireless | IP rating: IPX7 | Connectivity: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC, GPS Cellular  Altimeter  Cellular options  Music streaming with cellular  LTE isn't good value  Battery life needs to be longer  The new regular Apple Watch 3 and Apple Watch 3 LTE delivers a really minimal upgrade, unliked the new iPhone X. The latter version essentially just adds in connectivity to its latest wearable. This basic Series 3 model though can only be called an incremental upgrade over the Apple Watch 2.  If you're not that bothered about being connected wherever you are - or don't want to pay extra for the capability - you might want to look at the older Apple Watch Series 2 deals below and save yourself some money.  Apple Watch 2 deals  Fitness takes over the Apple Watch  OS: watchOS 4 | Compatibility: iOS | Display: 1.53\" OLED | Processor: S2 dual-core | Onboard storage: 8GB (only 2GB and 75MB allowed for music and photos, respectively) | Battery: 18 hours | Charging method: Wireless | IP rating: IPX7 | Connectivity: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC  Water-resistant  GPS onboard  Expensive  Lack of useful apps  The Apple Watch 2 isn't being sold by Apple, but it's still being pushed around by various retailers for those who want the older, but very similar, Watch on the cheap.  It includes specs and features not available for the cheaper Apple Watch Series 1. This includes GPS tracking, a brighter screen and waterproof specs that allow you to wear it in the pool - which can also be found on the Watch 3.  All of that sounds great, until you see the expensive price tag, especially for the Ceramic Apple Watch 2.  Aluminum cases make for the cheapest Apple Watch 2, followed by stainless steel and ceramic. There\u2019s no gold model any more, but more intricate Apple Watch bands do lead to higher prices. In other words, you have to shop smartly when picking out your Apple Watch 2 below - but it's a much better option for most when looking for the more sport-enabled Watch.  Read our full review: Apple Watch 2  Apple Watch Nike Plus deals  The Nike-flavored Apple Watch 2 and 3  OS: watchOS 4 | Compatibility: iOS | Display: 1.53\" OLED | Processor: S2 dual-core / improved in Watch 3 | Onboard storage: 8GB (only 2GB and 75MB allowed for music and photos, respectively) | Battery: 18 hours | Charging method: Wireless | IP rating: water-resistant IPX7 | Connectivity: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC  Water-resistant  GPS onboard  Limited fitness app  Not always accurate  Right - let's clear this up: there are two Nike+ editions of the Apple Watch. The first is the Nike+ Apple Watch Series 2, and the second the Nike+ Apple Watch Series 3.  Both are virtually identical to the 'standard' version of the Watch they're related to, apart from different (and really rather nice) rubberised straps that you can't easily buy separately and new watch faces.  Other than that, they don't really offer a lot more other than a stylistic option - and of course they're 'designed' to be use with the Nike app.  So if you're seeing the Nike+ Apple Watch for cheap, make sure it's not the Series 2 model... although that one is perfectly good enough in our eyes, and offers all the advantages minus the LTE connectivity.  Apple Series 1 deals  The best Apple Watch for most non-runners  OS: watchOS 4 | Compatibility: iOS | Display: 1.53\" OLED | Processor: S1P dual-core | Onboard storage: 8GB (only 2GB and 75MB allowed for music and photos, respectively) | Battery: 18 hours | Charging method: Wireless | IP rating: splash-proof | Connectivity: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC  Best Apple Watch for most  Faster than original Watch  Lacks Series 2's bright screen  No GPS and not waterproof  The Apple Watch Series 1 is actually the best Apple Watch for most people who aren\u2019t all-star runners and avid swimmers, with most of the specs you need on a smartwatch.  This is a 'refreshed' Apple Watch compared to the original Apple Watch below, so it has a faster dual-core processor and better battery life as a result.  It runs all the same WatchOS 4 software, which brings some decent improvements and, best of all, the original Watch costs a lot less than the models above.  If you don\u2019t need to track GPS runs and swim with it on, you\u2019ll save money. The discounted Apple Watch Series 1 still comes in two sizes, 38mm and 42mm, but only has the more economical aluminum case and Sport band, although it's still good value despite the limited choice.  Original Apple Watch deals  The iPhone-tailored smartwatch merely a convenient gadget  OS: watchOS 4 | Compatibility: iOS | Display: 1.53\" OLED | Processor: S1 System-in-Package (SiP) | Band sizes: Varies drastically per style | Onboard storage: 8GB (only 2GB and 75MB allowed for music and photos, respectively) | Battery: 18 hours | Charging method: Wireless | IP rating: IPX7 | Connectivity: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC  Can be cheapest model  Slower performance  Battery life is one day  The cheapest Apple Watch on sale today is the original iWatch, the company\u2019s first smartwatch that came out in April 2015.  No, the Apple Store doesn\u2019t sell this price-reduced Apple Watch 1 anymore, but there are plenty of retailers still hawking the original Apple Watch at a discount.  However, we thoroughly recommend that you look at some of the other options unless the cost is really low, as most places aren't selling the first version of the Apple Watch - one that's rather outdated, don't forget - for a good enough price.  Apple Watch band/strap deals  Bands are not one-size-fits-all-budgets  Wide variety of sizes, colors and prices  Incredibly easy to slide onto your Watch  Can't use normal watch straps  Official Apple Watch bands are pricey  Your Apple Watch literally isn\u2019t complete without the best deals on Apple Watch bands. They make the geeky smartwatch stylish enough to show off to late adopters.  In fact, you\u2019re going to want multiple cheap Apple Watch straps simply because more elegant bands are far from ideal for the gym. Vice versa, Sport Bands don\u2019t cut it at the fancy dinner table.  Everyday in the news, we see new cheap Apple Watch bands trying to become the de facto alternative to the more expensive, official Apple Watch bands, and they\u2019re usually just as good. Trust us, buying a trio of third-party, lookalike Apple Watch bands for the price of one official strap is a relief after paying so much for the smartwatch itself. Plus, you'll want to save up for the eventually Apple Watch 3.", "stock": "AAPL"}, {"url": "https://www.techradar.com/how-to/how-to-disable-emergency-sos-on-iphone-and-apple-watch", "label": -1, "source": "techradar", "date": "2018-03-19", "article": "Hopefully you\u2019ve never had to make an emergency SOS call, but if you need to do so there\u2019s a potentially very handy feature built into iOS 11 and the Apple Watch, which makes calling the emergency services quick and easy.  The problem is that it\u2019s sometimes too easy, with The Verge and other outlets reporting that a number of people have accidentally made SOS calls, in some cases resulting in the police arriving unexpectedly.  That\u2019s because all you need to do to place an emergency call from your Apple Watch is hold down the crown button for long enough. Do this and an Emergency SOS slider will appear, but you don\u2019t even need to swipe this, as simply holding the button down for long enough will eventually place the call.  On the iPhone X, iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus it\u2019s a bit trickier to accidentally trigger, but it can still happen, as you simply have to hold down the side button and one of the volume buttons until a slider appears, at which point you can either drag the slider or simply keep holding.  Emergency SOS can almost be too easy to trigger  It\u2019s even less likely to happen on the iPhone 7 or below, as you need to rapidly press the side button five times, then drag the Emergency SOS slider that appears. But in all cases it\u2019s possible to imagine a situation where it could be triggered accidentally.  You can\u2019t totally disable Emergency SOS, which is fair enough since it\u2019s a potentially life-saving feature, but the good news is that you can make it less likely to trigger accidentally. Here\u2019s how.  Disabling Auto Call on the iPhone X, iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus  Disabling Auto Call makes accidental SOS calls less likely  On Apple\u2019s latest handsets you can disable the function that enables the phone to automatically call the emergency services if you simply holding down the side button and a volume button.  To do this, head into the Settings app, then tap Emergency SOS and set the Auto Call toggle to off. Now if you hold down the side button and a volume button the Emergency SOS slider will appear as normal, but you\u2019ll have to swipe it to place the call \u2013 continuing to hold the buttons won\u2019t do it.  On the iPhone 7 or below there\u2019s no setting to change, as by default you have to swipe the slider.  Disabling Auto Call on Apple Watch  Disable Auto Call on Apple Watch so that the crown button isn't all that's between you and a visit from the emergency services  The process is similar on the Apple Watch. Open the Apple Watch app on your iPhone and tap the My Watch tab, then tap General, then Emergency SOS.  From there you\u2019ll see an Auto Call toggle which you can tap to disable. Doing this will mean you\u2019ll have to swipe the Emergency SOS slider when it appears, rather than just continuing to hold the crown button.  Enabling Auto Call  If you change your mind and want to make it as easy as possible to call the emergency services, just repeat the steps above and enable the Auto Call toggle.

We've also seen a leak that suggests Face ID from the iPhone X may be ready for the wrist.  The Apple Watch 3 is the best wearable Apple has built, and, as it tops our best smartwatch list, it\u2019s arguably the best smartwatch from any manufacturer that you can buy right now.  But, like most things in the gadget world, it\u2019s still not perfect or essential in the way that a smartphone is, so naturally it's expected Apple plans to improve it with a Watch 4.  Below we've put together all of the leaks, rumors and speculation about the Apple Watch 4 we've seen so far, plus a list of things we'd like to see Apple implement in its next generation wearable.  Cut to the chase  What is it? The next generation Apple smartwatch  The next generation Apple smartwatch When is it out? Possibly September 2018 alongside new iPhones  Possibly September 2018 alongside new iPhones What will it cost? Probably upwards of \u00a3329 / $329 / AU$459  The Apple Watch 3 in both black and rose gold  Apple announced the third iteration of its smartwatch on September 22, 2017, so we expect we'll have to wait until at least September 2018 to see the launch of the Apple Watch 4.  As the Apple Watch 2 was released a year earlier in September 2016, that\u2019s our best guess - but it's quite likely. We could be waiting even longer though as the gap between the original Apple Watch and the Apple Watch 2 was over a year at 17 months.  There\u2019s no word on the Apple Watch Series 4's price, but it\u2019s likely to be around the same as the Apple Watch 3 currently is, meaning a starting price of around \u00a3329 / $329 / AU$459 for the smaller 38mm version.  That said, the Apple Watch 3 actually had a lower launch price than the Apple Watch 2, so with all the extra tech likely to be found in the Apple Watch 4 the price could equally increase or decrease a little.  Bear in mind that the price we've mentioned above is just the starting cost. If you choose the larger 42mm band or opt for LTE connectivity, the Apple Watch 3 gets more expensive, as does choosing a pricier case or strap material. All of that is likely to remain true for the Apple Watch 4.  Apple Watch 4 design and display  A trusted analyst that has previous history of predicting Apple products suggests the Apple Watch 4 is set to undergo a big design overhaul.  So far every generation of the Apple Watch has come in either 38mm or 42mm screen sizes, but KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says he believes the Apple Watch 4 will have a 15% larger display.  That doesn't necessarily mean the Apple Watch 4 is going to a much bigger watch - the Watch 3 has a lot of bezel space around the outside of the display, so it may be the company has slimmed this down to fit in the extra screen real estate.  That said, Kuo's report does suggest the company will be including a larger battery inside the Apple Watch 4 that will likely mean the body of the watch will have to be at least a touch bigger to squeeze in the larger cell.  Kuo also notes that the design of the Apple Watch 4 is set to be \"more trendy\", but exactly what the analyst means by this isn't particularly clear yet so we'll have to wait for picture leaks to know more about the look.  Before Kuo's comments, we had seen a patent for a self-adjusting watch strap. This would involve a mechanism that expands and contracts the strap as needed, so that the fit remains comfortable and not too loose at all times, which could also help ensure the sensors on the watch get accurate readings.  The Apple Watch 4 could have a strap that resizes itself. Credit: Apple Insider  It's unlikely to happen on the Apple Watch 4, but back in 2016 we also saw a patent filed by the company for a round smartwatch so we may see that in some future generations of the wearable.  Apple Watch 4 features and spec  One leak suggests Apple will use faster, more versatile circuit boards for its antenna. That's again according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo who speculates it'll mean a more stable LTE signal and better heat and moisture resistance.  Rumors for watchOS 5 (learn more about that below) suggest the upgrades to the OS will be using the LTE signal much more regularly, so it makes sense if the company plans to update it to a faster antenna.  One change that we can predict is the chipset, with a new Apple S4 one likely to be included, though we don\u2019t yet know how much difference that will make.  As for new features on the Apple Watch 4, it looks like you may able to unlock your watch by just looking at it. Apple patents show that the Apple Watch 4 may bring a Face ID camera to make the wearable more secure.  That'd mean you'd just be able to look at your watch to unlock it and avoid having to enter an annoying PIN number to be able to use certain functionalities. Additionally, it would make it a whole lot easier to make quick FaceTime calls from your wrist  Apple Watch 4 fitness  One report from late in 2017 suggests the Watch 4 could get an upgraded heart rate tracker that could embrace EKG technology for the first time.  EKGs, also known as ECGs or electrocardiograms, are more advanced than a standard heart rate monitor and provide more in depth information, by using currents of electricity to analyze your heart's behavior.  The rumor comes from Bloomberg (who spoke to people familiar with Apple Watch 4 plans) but the site also spoke to a cardiologist at the University of California who said the feature isn't intended for those who don't experience heart-related issues.  The cardiologist went as far to say if you\u2019re a \"healthy person\", \u201cthere\u2019s no reason to follow ECG\u201d activity.  There's also an older patent for a wearable that can measure your respiration rate, which could well be a feature on the Apple Watch 4, but considering we've yet to see any further leaks about the feature it may be something included on a future wearable like the Watch 5.  You can expect the return of fitness features we've seen on the Apple Watch 3 including the top-end heart rate monitor and GPS technology as well as the ability to track your swimming with the waterproof design.  Apple Watch 4 OS and battery  It\u2019s also likely that the Apple Watch 4 will run watchOS 5, although again we've got very little information on what that will feature.  One report has said the new software will bring something called StreamKit, which would allow for a Spotify app on Apple Watch. That would be a big deal for those who don't use Apple Music.  StreamKit is a framework that's set up behind the scenes to allow cellular versions of the Apple Watch to receive push notifications from apps. That would mean you'd be able to get Facebook or Twitter messages directly to your wrist, and it's another step toward having a fully functioning phone replacement.  Apple Watch 4: what we want to see  While exact details about the Apple Watch 4 remain a mystery for now, the things we want from it aren\u2019t enigmatic at all. In fact, they\u2019re right underneath these words.  1. Android compatibility  If the Apple Watch 4 supported Android it would have wider appeal  We know this is hugely unlikely to happen, but wouldn\u2019t it be great? It would also help the Apple Watch match Android Wear in one of the few areas where it doesn\u2019t already, since Android Wear offers limited compatibility with iOS devices.  It\u2019s understandable that Apple would want to keep its Watch working only with other Apple devices, since doing so keeps people in its ecosystem \u2013 you\u2019re not going to switch to an Android phone if you already have an Apple Watch.  But that could also put off anyone who doesn\u2019t want to make a long-term commitment to Apple, and it completely rules out anyone who currently uses an Android phone from having one of the best smartwatches on the market.  2. Even better battery life  The Apple Watch 3 actually has quite good battery life, at least by smartwatch standards, easily lasting at least two days if you don\u2019t use LTE.  But that still leaves plenty of room for improvement. Many fitness trackers last around a week or longer and of course a conventional watch will go for years.  It\u2019s not realistic to expect the Apple Watch 4 to do the same, but any gains would be appreciated and help make it feel like less of a downgrade from your analog watch in that area.  Improvements could also make sleep tracking more viable, since currently you\u2019re likely to plug your Watch in overnight.  3. More fitness features  The Watch 3 is a good fitness watch, the Apple Watch 4 could be a great one  The Apple Watch has become more and more a health and fitness device over the years and that\u2019s now one of its main selling points, but there\u2019s still room for improvement here.  Much of this will be handled by apps and software updates, but we\u2019d like to see more health and fitness skills from the actual Apple Watch 4 hardware too, such as sensors that can track your respiration rate and blood oxygen levels.  4. Better Siri  One of our few complaints in our Apple Watch 3 review was about the patchiness of Siri. When it works it\u2019s great, but sometimes commands won\u2019t be heard or interpreted properly and that sort of thing can put people off using it at all, since when it does fail you\u2019d usually be quicker doing the thing by hand.  So we\u2019d like Siri on the Apple Watch 4 to work better. That\u2019s probably largely a software or connectivity hurdle, which could mean any improvements will reach older models too.  Another option would be for Apple to improve the microphone so Siri can hear us better, but that's not really the main issue we faced on the Apple Watch 3.  5. Improved performance  Apple upgraded the chipset in the Apple Watch 3 but it\u2019s still not quite as speedy as we\u2019d like, especially when it comes to loading apps, which often isn\u2019t instantaneous.  Much of the time the Apple Watch\u2019s whole purpose is to be a faster, simpler alternative to getting out your phone, but if you\u2019re waiting for apps to load it\u2019s arguably not.  So we hope the chipset in the Apple Watch 4 \u2013 likely to be called the Apple S4 \u2013 will offer the sort of smooth performance we get with an iPhone 8 or iPhone X.  6. A circular option  Not everyone wants a square watch, so we'd like to see a circular option  On the scale of things that are going to happen this ranks way above Android compatibility but below most other things.  Apple seems happy with the design of the Watch and hasn\u2019t substantially changed it in the various versions it\u2019s launched so far, so we don\u2019t expect a redesign any time soon, let alone a completely different screen shape.  But having a circle as an option would be nice. Conventional watches often have a circular face, as do many Android Wear ones, so to appeal to more buyers it would make some sense to offer the choice.  The issue is it would mean reworking the interface a bit, which Apple probably doesn't want to do.  7. Heart rate insights  The heart rate monitor in the Apple Watch 3 is fairly impressive, as it can keep a record of things like your heart rate ranges when working out, your heart rate variability and your daily resting heart rate, as well as your beats per minute, but it doesn\u2019t do much with the information.  It would be good if the Apple Watch 4 \u2013 or a software update on previous models \u2013 added insights into what these stats actually mean and how you can affect them, because that would turn some graphs into genuinely usable information.  Given WatchOS 4 already brings the ability to poke you to be more active at times that are helpful to you, using this heart rate data to help you get fitter (by suggesting slightly longer walks, or congratulating you on lowering your resting heart rate with reasons it's happened) would be excellent.", "stock": "AAPL"}, {"url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/gudi-padwa-cashback-offer-up-to-rs-10000-cashback-on-apple-products", "label": -1, "source": "techradar", "date": "2018-03-19", "article": "To celebrate Gudi Padwa, the traditional new year for Marathi Hindus, Apple authorized resellers are offering attractive cashback and no cost EMIs on a wide range of Apple products in the country.

Earlier today we reported that clues along the Apple supply line suggest that the device might ship in February , and this afternoon word dropped that Apple had finally gained approval from the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for the device.  In the official FCC filing, the device is referred to as the \"Apple Inc. Wireless Speaker,\" with a code name of A1639. Accompanying product diagrams almost certainly confirm that it's the same device that we've seen discussed since June of last year.  The approval clears the way for Apple to start selling the device on US shelves, and FCC approvals are often considered a reliable indicator that a new Apple product will be heading our way soon. (In some cases, though, as with product A1844 , the approved device turns out to be something as mundane as a door lock that was intended for Apple's new campus.)  As MacRumors notes, for instance, the iPhone X secured FCC approval on October 4 and was available to the public beginning November 3.  A long way to midsummer  It's possible that we won't see that quick of a turnaround for the HomePod, but the FCC approval suggests that Apple might meet its updated \"Early 2018\" HomePod release date for customers in the US, the UK and Australia after all.  As a downside, an \"Early 2018\" release window would still be applicable months after the current rough winter is only a memory. Other complications that prevent the HomePod from releasing in a timely manner could also still be on the horizon, of course.  Considering that smart speakers like the Amazon Echo and the Echo Dot already saw massive sales last December , Apple should probably get its latest device in homes before it gets left in the wake.

Following the macOS 10.13.4 update, the Duet client app hangs without starting.  Duet Display developer Duet Inc. is advising its customers to refrain from upgrading to the latest macOS so as to avoid the issue, according to MacRumors , as well as contact Apple directly through its bug reporting features.  Worse off is that desktop extension apps, like Air Display and iDisplay, are also reportedly experiencing related issues, also according to MacRumors. The website also cites speculation in said discussions around these issues that Apple\u2019s eGPU support in the operating system update is to blame.

It's shorn of the power and performance of the iPad Pro range, but the addition of Apple Pencil compatibility and the A10 chipset bring it pretty close, and for a lot less cash. It irks that you need to buy the Pencil separately to unlock a key feature, and design-wise we're seeing something pretty old-school here\u2026 but for the price it's hard to criticize too much, and this is still the best tablet on the market.  The new iPad for 2018 is designed to achieve one thing: deliver the best of Apple\u2019s tablet efforts at a more affordable price.  Note that we say more affordable, rather than cheap \u2013 because the cost is still higher than many other tablets out there \u2013 but the new upgrades bring a lot to the iPad, bridging the gap between a \u2018standard\u2019 slate and the more impressive iPad Pro range.  Support for the Apple Pencil adds another dimension to the tablet, enabling a new method of interaction and bringing with it a slew of new apps to interact with, and the upgraded chipset inside \u2013 the same one that powered the iPhone 7 \u2013 offers more power than many will know what to do with.  The upshot? You\u2019ve now got a hugely capable tablet, one with more power and offering more possibilities, at a fairly reasonable price point.  You may be thinking that this is a \u2018student\u2019s iPad\u2019, as Apple has made a big deal about the new tablet's classroom credentials, but in reality most of the people who buy it will be those who want something to use on the commute and around the house \u2013 and as you\u2019ll see, it fares pretty well in those respects.  While this might all sound impressive, it\u2019s still not the full picture, as all these features are combined with the best tablet platform out there, iOS \u2013 there\u2019s a reason the iPad has sat atop our best tablet rankings for so long.  The new iPad was launched in March 2018, and comes with a range of storage and connectivity options.  The new iPad 2018 price starts at $329 (\u00a3319, AU$469), but schools will get a discount in the UK and US of around 10%.  At $329 (AU$469) the new iPad price is exactly the same as the starting price of the new iPad (2017) \u2013 and both come with 32GB of storage \u2013 in the US and Australia, while in the UK it looks like consumers are being treated to a discount, as currency fluctuations mean the basic 32GB version is actually \u00a320 cheaper than last year's iPad.  That's for the Wi-Fi only model, with the 32GB slate with cellular connectivity setting you back $459 (\u00a3449, AU$669).  The 128GB version begins at $429 / \u00a3409 / AU$599 for those who want more storage, with an extra premium to pay if you want some bytes of data floating in on the go.  Apple Pencil  Useful addition for artists  Costs extra to buy  The Apple Pencil\u2026 it\u2019s tough to work out whether it\u2019s a genuinely innovative tool or not. We\u2019ve been using it for a few years now, and have found that it\u2019s great for some things, but useless for others.  Also, let\u2019s not forget that it costs \u00a399 / $99 / AU$145, which means you need to pay around 33% of the price of the new iPad, on top of the cost of the slate itself, in order to access the key new feature.  It\u2019s cheaper for those in education, and there is the Logitech Crayon available in the US for half the price (and less functionality), but it\u2019s worth bearing in mind when buying the new iPad.  If you\u2019re looking for something to replace a notepad, we wouldn\u2019t recommend the new iPad \u2013 or any iPad for that matter, as it\u2019s really difficult to write legibly on them, thanks to the way the tip of the Pencil glides across the surface.  Apple could make the glass more matte and ridged to help, but that would make the display harder to see, so it\u2019s not an easily solved conundrum.  The Notepad app is fine, and allows you to write and sketch, and now the iWork Suite from Apple is collaborative, and you can mark-up documents on it (it took Apple far too long to enable this feature, with Microsoft inexplicably adding in mark-up functionality first to its iPad apps.  This would be a lovely feature if, as referenced, writing on it was easy; but notes can't simply be jotted, they require concentrated efforts of penmanship\u2026 and most of the people we work with are on Google Docs, so sharing a marked-up Pages document was useless.  In a classroom environment it will be more useful if a teacher and the students are all on the same platform\u2026 as long as the teacher has immaculate handwriting and patience to write a little slower.  If you\u2019re just underlining sections or pointing to things then the finger is just as good \u2013 so maybe make sure you really need the Pencil before forking out all that cash.  However, where the stylus does become worth the outlay is when you want to be artistic \u2013 there are a few good apps out there for the Apple Pencil that let you color, change the shading of a photo or get pretty deep into some photo / video manipulation.  We had a great time coloring and sketching during our review, and even if you\u2019re bereft of any kind of talent there\u2019s a lot you can do.  The multi-level pressure of the Pencil comes into its own here, and if you\u2019re in any way artistic then you\u2019ve got loads \u2013 and loads, and loads \u2013 of different styles of brush, pen and other drawing implements you can work with.  Just note that most of the time you\u2019ll be charging the Pencil by plugging it into the bottom of the iPad\u2026 it doesn\u2019t look good.  A10 Fusion chip  Impressive power  Comes with 2GB of RAM  We were all expecting Apple to stick with the same \u2018good enough\u2019 A9 chipset from 2017\u2019s iPad and drop the price, but it\u2019s gone up and shoved in the A10 Fusion chip that powered the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, and which is close to the A10X chip in the new iPad Pro range.  That's combined with 2GB of RAM, so there's more than enough power here for nearly any task that most users will want to do with the new iPad, and certainly for emailing, web browsing or watching video.  We noticed some slowdown with heavier apps, for example when processing and opening multiple photos, but we never had to wait too long, and rendering times were still pretty impressive.  That said, if you\u2019re going to do a lot of more demanding work, that\u2019s why Apple has the iPad Pro 10.5 , with the extra power in the CPU and double the RAM.  In our tests, the new iPad (2018) returned a similar single-core benchmarking score to the more powerful iPad Pro 10.5, showing that if you\u2019re not going to be using the cheaper iPad intensively then there\u2019s no reason to spend the extra cash.  It might seem hard to fathom why Apple has thrown in the extra power here, but users will hang onto their iPads for a long, long time (much longer than they would an iPhone), and having more power means they\u2019ll keep running smoothly, and remain upgradeable, for longer.  You\u2019ll be unlikely to use most of the power in the new iPad, to be honest, but the upshot it that it runs incredibly smoothly, and apps open and close with ease\u2026 and it\u2019s likely to keep doing that for longer, so you won\u2019t need to upgrade as soon.", "stock": "AAPL"}, {"url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/apple-carplay", "label": 1, "source": "techradar", "date": "2018-04-10", "article": "Apple CarPlay: everything you need to know  Years ago, no one minded if their car\u2019s dashboard only offered the most basic of digital information.

This means when your iPhone is plugged in, the car\u2019s own system is replaced by the iOS home screen, complete with app icons and a virtual home button.  CarPlay can be interacted with via whatever controls your car already has, whether that be a touch screen, buttons, knobs, voice or a combination of all of these.  CarPlay doesn\u2019t include every app on your smartphone, because playing PUBG on your car dashboard is clearly a disaster waiting to happen, and some elements of apps are replaced by voice and dictation.  For example, incoming iMessages and WhatsApp messages are read out to you by Siri instead of shown on the display.  The 2017 Hyundai Elantra supports CarPlay for under $20,000  Most cars require you to plug your iPhone into the USB port with a Lightning cable, but some newer models (like the latest BMW 5-Series) now support wireless CarPlay, which works via the car\u2019s Bluetooth connection.  This is more convenient, but you\u2019ll want to make sure your iPhone is sat on a wireless charger if using wireless CarPlay, as it can drain the battery quickly if you\u2019re streaming music over 4G and using the Maps app for navigation.  CarPlay is designed to remove the urge to take a quick look at your iPhone behind the wheel. It\u2019s safer, easier and more convenient - or that\u2019s the idea, anyway.  Which cars support Apple CarPlay?  As of March 2018, there are over 300 models of car with CarPlay available either standard or as a paid-for optional extra.  Some cars bundle CarPlay when you opt for the enhanced sound system, for example, or pick a higher level of cabin trim level.  Other manufacturers charge a premium for adding CarPlay on its own, and the price can vary significantly.  For example, Honda includes CarPlay as standard on some models, and Ford includes CarPlay with its \u00a3750 (around $1,000) Sync 3 system in the new Fiesta (along with a larger touch screen and six speakers).  At the other end of the scale, Ferrari charges a huge \u00a32,400 (around $3,000) for adding the software necessary to make it work.  We have included a list of manufacturers currently offering CarPlay at the end of this article. Although it doesn\u2019t include everyone just yet, you\u2019ll be doing well to name a car maker off the top of your head that doesn\u2019t offer CarPlay  Apple CarPlay aftermarket solutions?  If you\u2019re not in the market for a new car, you can still get some CarPlay in your life by installing an aftermarket stereo.  Manufacturers like Alpine, Clarion, JBL, JVC, Kenwood, Pioneer and Sony all sell car stereo systems with CarPlay, as well as other goodies like Android Auto, Bluetooth and DAB digital radio.  The JBL Legend CP100 with Apple CarPlay  Prices start at around \u00a3200 ($280, AU$360) for an entry-level unit from a company like Power Acoustik, and go beyond \u00a3500 ($700, AU$900) for a fold-out system from Pioneer.  What you need to know about these systems is that car stereos come in two sizes; single DIN and double DIN. Single DIN units are usually two inches tall, while double DIN means a system which is four inches tall.  The former, like the Pioneer AVH-Z7000DAB we referred to above, is a single DIN unit with a motorised screen which folds out of your dashboard. Modern cars with their curved dashboards tend to not cater for aftermarket stereos like these without modification to the dashboard - something which is generally not advisable.  Is my iPhone compatible with CarPlay?  If you\u2019re still rocking an old iPhone with a 30-pin connector, then you\u2019re out of luck; any model before the iPhone 5 does not work with CarPlay. No model of iPad or iPod Touch work with CarPlay.  But it also means a lot of iPhones do - and here they are:  iPhone 5  iPhone 5S  iPhone 5C  iPhone SE  iPhone 6  iPhone 6 Plus  iPhone 6S  iPhone 6S Plus  iPhone 7  iPhone 7 Plus  iPhone 8  iPhone 8 Plus  iPhone X  What does CarPlay look like?  CarPlay is designed to look a lot like iOS. Sure, the home screen background is made black and most of your apps are hidden from view, but CarPlay is still the bare bones of your iPhone.  The main screen shows a selection of apps like Phone, Music, Maps and Messages, along with the time, your phone\u2019s signal strength, and a virtual home button.  As you open and close apps, the most recent three appear at the side of the user interface nearest the steering wheel, making it easy to return to the map, for example, without taking your eyes off the road for more than a quick glance.  That really is the point of CarPlay; it offers access to your iPhone\u2019s core features without distracting you from driving.  That\u2019s why most apps are hidden, and why many employ Siri to read things out rather than letting you read them off the screen.  For example, open the Messages app and you\u2019ll see a list of the most recent people to chat with you, but when you tap on a name Siri reads out any unread messages, or asks if you\u2019d like to dictate a reply.  Notifications appear at the top of the screen as they do on your iPhone, but these are limited to apps which can be used by CarPlay. If your phone receives a breaking news alert from the BBC, for example, it won\u2019t show up.  CarPlay also employs several tricks to make you spend less time looking at it. If you scroll through the artists list in your Music app, the interface will start showing large letters instead of every artist. Scroll until you get to the right letter, then pick the artist you want.  The home screen also shows an app to tap on if you want to return to the car\u2019s own infotainment system.  To adjust the layout of apps on CarPlay you have to head into the Settings app on your iPhone itself (when it isn\u2019t connected to the car).  Tap General, then CarPlay, then the car you want to change the home page of, and move the apps around as you would on the home screen of the phone itself.  Third-party apps compatible with CarPlay:  WhatsApp  Spotify  Amazon Music  Google Play Music  iPlayer Radio  CBS Radio  Pandora  Slacker Radio  Tidal  Audible  NPR One  VOX  Clammr  Downcast  While this should cater for most people\u2019s music and messaging needs, mapping is an area where CarPlay could be vastly improved. Only Apple Maps works, so you won\u2019t be able to access Google Maps or Waze while on the move.

Apple put considerable time and effort into making its first smart speaker sound better than its rivals, and Chris Velazco argues they succeeded.

For a number of reasons, EPA should not repeal the Clean Power Plan.\" The company goes on to argue that adopting the plan would help the US become a global leader in the effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and states that through its own efforts, it has shown that the CPP's targets are achievable without negatively impacting reliability or resiliency.  Apple also says that the CPP recognizes the increasingly interconnected and dynamic nature of how power is generated, sold and consumed and that it can give US companies a competitive edge in the market by stabilizing energy costs. \"In addition to the benefit of replacing more polluting, less sustainable forms of energy, investment in clean energy can provide corporate electricity buyers with a hedge against fuel price fluctuation,\" says Apple. \"Unlike traditional forms of energy, clean electricity generation, like solar and wind, is not fuel-price sensitive.

Aside from a handful of analyst estimates, we don't know how many iPhone Xs Apple has sold. The company doesn't break out sales by iPhone model, though we'll learn more about iPhone sales overall in its earnings report next week. The general consensus is that the X sales, while not terrible, fell short of expectations. Let's put these sales forecasts aside -- what's done is done. If Apple does discontinue the existing iPhone X (which seems more than possible), it'll have more to do with future sales than past ones.  Kuo -- who is often hailed as the Best Apple Analyst, Period -- has been saying for months now that Apple will overhaul its iPhone lineup in 2018 with a trio of iPhone X-like devices, complete with expansive screens and those telltale notches for Face ID. At the high end, Kuo predicts Apple will release a sort of iPhone X Plus, with a 6.5-inch OLED screen and a stainless steel body. The low end should be well tended by a new X-like iPhone with a cheaper 6.1-inch LCD screen, a single camera and (in a bizarre twist) no pressure-sensing 3D Touch display. Meanwhile, right in the middle of the pack sits a 5.8-inch, stainless steel-clad iPhone X sequel.  But here's the thing: According to a more recent research note Kuo dropped, that hypothetical low-end iPhone is expected to sell for between $750 and $800 without a contract. Considering that Apple usually keeps selling existing iPhones at reduced prices after new models have launched, it's not hard to see how a discounted iPhone X could eat into sales of Apple's new LCD model. That simply can't happen.  Based on what little we know about the the 6.1-inch iPhone, it's a little less ambitious in every way (save for perhaps its size). That logically means it's cheaper to make, and it's no stretch to imagine that Apple would see bigger margins off those things. Given the choice between making some money off each original iPhone X sold and potentially making more money off a cheap, big X sequel, treating the current model like a sacrificial lamb doesn't seem like a huge stretch. And having a big, relatively inexpensive iPhone with an edge-to-edge screen could be a huge help for Apple in China, where the company is facing intense pressure from homegrown rivals that have proved themselves capable of building high-powered smartphones with budget price tags.  Oh, and let's not forget that Apple just does this sometimes. When it was time to build a sequel for the iPhone 5, the company built the 5s and replaced the existing iPhone 5 with the plastic-fantastic iPhone 5c. People were going to buy a low-cost iPhone that year anyway, and while no one really loved the 5c, the idea still has merit, assuming the hardware is done well.  So yes, the iPhone X will be dead in that you (probably) won't be able to buy last year's model once the sequels arrive. That's the whole point: Regardless of whether it sold as fast or as well as Apple hoped it would, the iPhone X did its job. It showed people what the iPhone could be. Whether Apple's strategy ultimately succeeds remains to be seen, but if it does, putting the first iPhone X to rest is a small price to pay.", "stock": "AAPL"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-taps-european-executive-to-run-global-music-business-1523474035", "label": 1, "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "date": "2018-04-11", "article": "Apple Music is poised to surpass Spotify Technology in paid subscribers in the U.S. Above, an advertisement in Manhattan.

Aetna shares fell 2.6% premarket following the insurer\u2019s quarterly sales and profit beats, though revenue dropped 5.6% in the most recent quarter from a year earlier. Other insurers were also down following the announcement from Amazon, Berkshire and JPMorgan. UnitedHealth Group, Anthem and Cigna all dropped at least 5%.  Shares of Wal-Mart were down 1.4% before the opening bell following a Journal report that the retail giant plans to ask suppliers to deliver more goods to warehouses exactly on time or face fines, another step in its efforts to keep inventory low and shelves stocked as it battles with Amazon.  McDonald's shares declined 0.3% premarket. The fast-food giant posted quarterly sales and profits that beat analyst expectations.  Shares of Maxim Integrated Products shed 11% premarket after Japanese firm Renesas Electronics denied a CNBC report saying that Renesas was in talks to acquire Maxim.  Callidus Software shares added 11% to $36.25 premarket on the news that German software company SAP SE has agreed to buy the firm for $2.4 billion to bolster its cloud-computing business. SAP will play $36 a share for the California-based firm.  Shares of Thomson Reuters climbed 11% before the opening bell following a Reuters report saying private-equity firm Blackstone Group is in advanced talks to buy a 55% stake in its financial and risk business for more than $17 billion. Blackstone was down 1.1%.  Pfizer shares were down 1.9% premarket. The drug company posted quarterly earnings and revenue that topped Wall Street expectations and gave an upbeat guidance for 2018, though sales projections for the year fell below some analyst targets.  Shares of United Continental Holdings climbed 1.1% to $66.50 premarket following a JPMorgan Chase analyst upgrade to overweight from underweight and price target increase to $83 from $60.  Harley-Davidson shares shed 6.4% before the opening bell. The motorcycle manufacturer reported its fourth straight year of declining sales and said it expects shipments to decline again this year.

Longbow Research analyst Shawn Harrison lowered his rating on the technology giant to \u201cneutral\u201d from \u201cbuy\u201d on Wednesday, reflecting the view among some Wall Street researchers that the latest group of iPhones will deliver modest sales performance. He didn\u2019t specify a price target.  \u201cWe now forecast only a good, not great iPhone cycle,\u201d Mr. Harrison wrote in a research note.  He said the more expensive price point of the X model may hinder some demand and the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus models have received a \u201clukewarm\u201d reception, both of which could restrain growth in iPhone shipments. He estimates that iPhone production growth will be in the high-single digits, lower than the consensus view of 10% that he cites.  \u201cAlthough there are now expanded drivers to AAPL\u2019s business, the iPhone continues to wag the dog,\u201d Mr. Harrison wrote. \u201cGiven our change in estimated iPhone growth profile near term, we anticipate this dynamic will limit upside stock appreciation.\u201d  Wall Street analysts have historically been hesitant to bet against Apple Inc., whose shares are up 47% over the last 12 months and 670% in the past decade. Twenty-nine of 37 analysts tracked by FactSet have \u201cbuy\u201d or \u201coverweight\u201d ratings on the stock, with an average price target of $192.73. There are no \u201csell\u201d or \u201cunderweight\u201d ratings.  The average analyst price target has increased each month for the past 14, according to FactSet data. Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts, for example, lifted their price target on the stock to $200 from $180 on Wednesday.  Shares were down 0.2% to $175.88 in recent trading Wednesday.  Many analysts have cited factors that could drive the stock higher, such as a tax-code overhaul, which is likely to encourage companies to bring home cash held overseas and could be handed to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. Apple has also seen higher demand for other products such as its Mac and iPad recently.  Longbow\u2019s downgrade appears to be the second among analysts in the last month. Nomura Instinet analyst Jeffrey Kvaal lowered his rating on the stock to \u201cneutral\u201d from \u201cbuy\u201d in December and dropped his price target to $175 from $185. He suggested that Apple\u2019s stock has historically dropped after new iPhone models come out, and this cycle appears to be no different.

Apple Inc., AAPL 0.34% Alphabet Inc. GOOGL -0.12% and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN -1.22% \u2014with a combined market value of more than $2 trillion\u2014all boosted growth by broadening their reach into new areas.  Apple\u2019s revenue rose 13% to $88.29 billion, fueled by its move to increase smartphone prices behind its new flagship iPhone X, released in November at $1,000. The company, whose profits topped $20 billion for the first time, is also increasingly benefiting from its services business, including App Store sales and music and payments services.  Google parent Alphabet has averaged revenue growth of at least 20% over the past 32 quarters, when adjusting for currency movements, according to RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney. Google is building in other areas, including cloud computing, a business that Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said brings in $1 billion a quarter.  Meanwhile, Amazon\u2014long known for prioritizing growth over earnings\u2014delivered a profit exceeding $1 billion for the first time as its revenue jumped 38% to $60.5 billion.  More than the other two companies, Amazon has spread beyond its core market. The online-retail giant has built the largest cloud-computing business, created a major Hollywood studio and, more recently, become a big bricks-and-mortar retailer with the acquisition of Whole Foods, which accounted for roughly 7% of its sales.  Two of the other largest tech companies by market value\u2014 Microsoft Corp. and Facebook Inc. \u2014reported record sales a day earlier. Revenue at Microsoft rose 12% to $28.92 billion as its cloud-computing division continued to grow, while Facebook\u2019s revenue jumped 47% to $12.97 billion.  Those companies are the five most valuable in the U.S. by market capitalization, the first time a single industry has occupied that position in several decades, according to S&P Capital Inc.  As the tech giants expand their clout across a widening band of commerce, they have increasingly drawn scrutiny from lawmakers and consumers over a range of issues, from their dominance of certain markets, to how they use their vast troves of consumer data, to the impact their products have on society.  The extraordinary runup in their share prices has helped fuel popular awareness of the companies\u2019 power, says Youssef Squali, an analyst with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.  \u201cIt\u2019s a combination of the fact that these have become such huge behemoths that they bear responsibility to society, and on the other hand you have all this lack of control of personal data,\u201d Mr. Squali said.  Facebook is contending with claims that its massive social network has had harmful effects on mental health and is used to disseminate hate speech, violent live videos and fabricated news articles. Lawmakers have scrutinized Facebook and other social-media firms, saying they failed to take more steps to keep Russian-backed actors from sowing division during the U.S. presidential election.  Facebook says it is addressing the issues in a number of ways, including employing more people who handle safety and security issues and ranking publisher posts based on user evaluations of trustworthiness.  Apple is facing criticism from prominent investors over the way smartphones affect children, as well as federal probes over its disclosure that it issued software updates that slowed performance on iPhones with older batteries. Apple apologized and said it would never do anything to harm its customers.  Google drew a $2.71 billion fine from European regulators, who said the search giant favored its comparison-shopping service over rivals. Google\u2019s YouTube, meanwhile, is grappling with a backlash from marketers over the placement of their ads in front of undesirable videos, including YouTube\u2019s curated lineup of \u201cpreferred\u201d content.  Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said on a call with analysts that new controls to review top videos on YouTube and set new limits on which content can run ads will make the site a safe place for advertisers. There have been concerns, he said, but \u201cwe\u2019re working really hard to address them and respond strongly.\u201d  A major shift for the tech industry came with the election of President Donald Trump, who had been critical of the industry in part due to what he said was a lack of U.S. job creation and investments overseas. Tech CEOs a little over a year ago met with the then-president elect. Shortly thereafter, plans for a tech council to advise the president dissolved.  Most recently, Mr. Trump called out Amazon, tweeting that the U.S. Postal Service should charge the online retail giant and other companies more to deliver packages.  The mood extends to Capitol Hill. Sen. Mark Warner (D., Va.) and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.) are working on legislation that would make political advertising with companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google more transparent. Meanwhile, U.S. Senators Jerry Moran (R., Kan.) and Richard Blumenthal (D., Conn.) this week wrote the Federal Trade Commission to ask it to investigate companies that sell fake social-media accounts, mentioning Twitter and YouTube specifically.  At the annual World Economic Forum last month, the world\u2019s largest technology companies defended themselves against complaints about everything from perceived anticompetitive behavior to threats from artificial intelligence. Some critics questioned the companies\u2019 potential elimination of jobs through advanced technology, while others pointed to their control of large amounts of personal data.  Salesforce.com Inc. CEO Marc Benioff, at the Davos, Switzerland, forum, called some tech companies\u2019 behavior \u201cnefarious,\u201d comparing the companies to the cigarette industry and calling for more government regulation. Martin Sorrell, CEO of advertising giant WPP PLC, compared the firms to Standard Oil, a U.S. oil giant that was broken up after regulators determined it was a monopoly.  In response to a question about Amazon\u2019s size, the company\u2019s retail chief, Jeff Wilke, said in an interview late last year with The Wall Street Journal that its businesses are very diverse and horizontally large. \u201cWe have incredible competition,\u201d he added.  Trip Miller, founder and managing partner at Gullane Capital LLC, which owns shares in Amazon, Apple and Alphabet, said management at the companies was strong, and they appear to have good opportunities for continued growth.  \u201cWhile we do understand some of the concerns around data and them potentially having so much information on our lives, I think it\u2019s just a byproduct of the world we live in,\u201d he said.  Apple\u2019s results offered hope that it can sustain its solid performance even amid stagnating global demand for smartphones. Analysts and investors have worried the company is too dependent on the iPhone, which accounts for about two-thirds of its revenue, as customers hold onto their phones longer and therefore buy fewer new ones.  Sales of the iPhone X in the quarter lifted the average selling price for iPhones by nearly 15%, Apple said. The 1.3 billion iPhones and other Apple devices now in active use helped its services business report an 18% jump in revenue. Results also were buoyed by strong growth in the division that includes its smartwatch and AirPods wireless earbuds.  Alphabet\u2019s profit jumped 28% to $6.84 billion, excluding a giant $9.9 billion charge related to the new U.S. tax law which turned its bottom line into the red. While the ad business makes up nearly all of its profit, Alphabet is investing in a dozen businesses such as self-driving cars and cybersecurity in hopes they will drive future revenue.  Amazon\u2019s core retail business was the main producer of its revenue growth in the quarter, as holiday shoppers went online. It also benefited from the company\u2019s $13.5 billion acquisition of Whole Foods, which generated more than $4 billion in revenue.  Amazon is known for reinvesting heavily in its business, and has said in recent quarters it is in an investment phase focusing on international expansion and building out its video content, among other initiatives.  Contributing its profitability in the fourth quarter was a tax benefit of $789 million, part of the tax overhaul. Still, Amazon\u2019s cloud-computing division put in a strong performance, as did its growing advertising business. And the company also worked on efficiency at its warehouses.

Apple Inc. said it is acquiring Texture, a digital-magazine-subscription service. Photo: Yui Mok/Zuma Press  Apple Inc. AAPL 0.34% said it will acquire Next Issue Media LLC and its digital-magazine-subscription service Texture, a product developed by top magazine companies that bundles together some 200 subscriptions into one monthly service.  The acquisition comes as Apple looks to beef up its services business, which includes music streaming and mobile payments.  Apple has set a goal of increasing total revenue from services to more than $40 billion by 2020. The company generated nearly $30 billion in services revenue in its fiscal year ended in September.  Apple typically takes a 15% cut of subscription services from publishers and content providers, including Netflix Inc. and HBO, if those subscriptions are purchased through the App Store.  Terms of the deal weren\u2019t disclosed. Next Issue Media and Texture are owned by Cond\u00e9 Nast, Meredith Corp. , Hearst Corp., Rogers Communications Inc. and KKR & Co.  The magazine industry for years has sought ways to transition from print to online, but has faced profound challenges competing with tech giants for digital ad dollars, while print ad revenue continues to decline.  Last year, Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and Facebook Inc. accounted for more than 63% of U.S. digital ad spending, according to eMarketer, while the magazine world has been buffeted by steady cutbacks and numerous rounds of consolidation.  Next Issue, which launched in 2009, was envisioned as a way for publishers to compete against tech titans like Apple, whose app store has come to dominate distribution in the digital publishing marketplace.  In a joint statement, Texture\u2019s key publishing investors said the sale was in line with the shifting marketplace the industry has faced.  \u201cThis new relationship with Apple not only will deliver new audiences and further the reach of our collective brands, but reflects the way consumers are engaging with media today as they look to discover content and subscribe with more convenience and ease,\u201d they said.  Texture, which offers a monthly, $10 subscription to magazines such as Vanity Fair, Good Housekeeping, Time, Sports Illustrated, and National Geographic, fits into Apple\u2019s effort to bring news and information to iPhone and iPad users. The company launched Apple News in 2015 and has been aggregating and providing news stories to iPhone users since then.  \u201cWe are committed to quality journalism from trusted sources and allowing magazines to keep producing beautifully designed and engaging stories for users,\u201d said Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s senior vice president who oversees the services business.

An iPhone X is seen on a large video screen in the new Apple Visitor Center in Cupertino, Calif., in November. Photo: elijah nouvelage/Reuters  Apple Inc. AAPL 0.34% is being investigated by the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission over potential securities violations related to the company\u2019s disclosure of a software update that slowed older iPhones, people familiar with the matter said.  The two probes add pressure on the tech giant to address criticism from customers and lawmakers after it acknowledged in December that it was throttling the performance of older iPhones as batteries aged. The company later apologized for the issue and slashed the price of an iPhone battery replacement to $29 from $79, hoping to win back customer goodwill.  Apple acknowledged in a statement that it is responding to questions from some government agencies, though it declined to disclose which agencies or any details regarding the questions. It also reiterated what it said in December, noting that it has \u201cnever\u2014and would never\u2014do anything to intentionally shorten the life of any Apple product, or degrade the user experience to drive customer upgrades.\u201d  The news of the investigations was reported earlier by Bloomberg.  Regulators and prosecutors often open investigations that don\u2019t result in any charges being filed, and securities investigations often take more than a year. It isn\u2019t clear why federal officials are focusing on potential securities violations involving an issue affecting customers.  Generally in such a case, the SEC could try to fault a public company for failing to make timely disclosures about material information that would affect the stock price. The company\u2019s potential liability would probably turn on whether the fallout from poor battery performance was likely to be material and whether the company delayed disclosing it or had the proper systems to detect and account for it.  Apple\u2019s stock has fallen about 4% since Apple\u2019s acknowledgment, but much of the losses have occurred in the past week ahead of Thursday\u2019s planned quarterly earnings report. Some of the declines have come amid reports of possible weaker-than-expected demand for the iPhone X. On Tuesday, Apple\u2019s shares fell 0.6% to $166.97.  Still, some analysts have said the battery issues could hit Apple\u2019s financials. Barclays said in a note this month that Apple could sell 16 million fewer iPhones this year, and lose $10.29 billion in revenue, directly related to customers choosing to replace batteries rather than replace their iPhones.  Apple last week announced it will release a spring software update with a feature that shows an iPhone battery\u2019s health and recommends when it needs to be serviced. Customers also will be able to see if the power-throttling feature is being used on their device and switch it off.  During an interview with ABC News earlier this month, Chief Executive Tim Cook said last year\u2019s update was designed to prevent users from having their phone power off during a call or while taking a photograph. He said Apple made the change to improve customers\u2019 experience and that Apple disclosed the feature at the time, though, he said people may not have been paying attention.  \u201cMaybe we should have been clearer, as well,\u201d Mr. Cook said. \u201cWe deeply apologize to anybody that thinks we had some other kind of motivation because our motivation is always the user.\u201d  Since acknowledging it throttled iPhone performance, the company has faced questions from consumer and watchdog groups in France, Italy and China. In France, the Paris prosecutor\u2019s office said early this month it opened an investigation into Apple for potential deception and \u201cprogrammed obsolescence.\u201d The investigation could lead to preliminary charges or be dropped.  Earlier this month, U.S. Sen. John Thune (R., S.D.), chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, sent Mr. Cook a letter seeking more information on how the company tracked customer complaints of processing performance and whether or not it considered offering rebates to customers who had replaced their batteries at a higher price.  Apple hasn\u2019t commented on the French investigation or Mr. Thune\u2019s letter.  Battery life and processing speeds are two of the most important features on smartphones. To prevent iPhone 6, 6s and SE devices from powering off automatically\u2014something that drew complaints last year from Chinese consumer-protection groups\u2014Apple said it updated its operating system, iOS, to slow certain tasks that required more computing power than a device could provide. It expanded the practice to the iPhone 7 in the fall.  The Apple investigations add to a mounting list of clashes between the Trump administration and tech firms over the past year, including a rollback of internet regulations that Silicon Valley had championed during the Obama era. Tech firms also have run into political trouble lately in Congress, particularly over alleged Russian online meddling in the 2016 election, but also user privacy concerns and liability for online sex trafficking.  \u2014John McKinnon contributed to this article.

Apple\u2019s dominance in classrooms has faded in the face of cheaper laptop options. Photo: Scott Olson/Getty Images  Apple Inc. said it is updating its entry-level iPad with capabilities designed to appeal to students and new software for teachers, as the company tries to recharge sales of the tablet and shore up its dwindling share of the U.S. education market.  The company Tuesday said its new 9.7-inch iPad includes a faster processor and works with the Apple Pencil stylus, which previously worked only with higher-end iPad Pro models.  The entry-level iPad\u2019s price remains at $329, the lowest-priced tablet available from the company. Schools, which receive discounts on pricing, can buy the device for $299.  The announcement, held at Lane Tech College Prep High School in Chicago, was coupled with software and support capabilities aimed at schools. They included more free cloud storage, a management system to assist schools with creating Apple IDs for students and a cloud-based app called Schoolwork that allows teachers to monitor students\u2019 progress on assignments.  The kindergarten-through-12 market represents a critical opportunity for tech companies to get young people accustomed to their operating systems. Introducing students to those systems could help sway future purchasing decisions that span the rest of their lives, said Scott Galloway, a marketing professor at New York University.  \u201cThe moment you get someone on your ecosystem, and they become fluent in your operating system, the switching costs become very real,\u201d Mr. Galloway said. A lot of consumers start on Apple\u2019s or Google\u2019s operating system and never switch, \u201cso it\u2019s logical to lock them in early,\u201d he said.  Technology companies have been pushing computers and other devices into the classroom since at least the 1970s, and Apple took an early lead with its easy-to-use operating system.  But the company\u2019s dominance faded in the face of cheaper laptop options such as Google Chromebooks from Alphabet Inc. or Windows-powered devices from Microsoft Corp. While many of those devices cost less than $300, Apple\u2019s MacBook starts at $999.  Apple\u2019s lowest-priced iPad, which got a $70 price cut last year, offers the company its best chance to compete in the cost-conscious education market.  But the addition of a Pencil and a keyboard\u2014which are necessary to take many computer-administered tests and could add more than $150 to the price\u2014make the iPad a costlier option than rival low-priced laptops, said Ben Davis, a senior education analyst with Futuresource Consulting.  Despite efforts by Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook to champion iPads as laptop replacements, iPad sales have fallen 40% from their peak in fiscal 2013 to $19.22 billion.  Losing ground to Chromebooks and Windows devices in the classroom contributed to the iPad\u2019s struggles, said Frank Catalano, an independent education technology analyst with Intrinsic Strategy.  The update to the entry level iPad is unlikely to reverse Apple\u2019s slump in education sales, analysts say. Over the past five years, Apple\u2019s share of computing shipments in the $18 billion U.S. education hardware market has fallen to 19% from 50%, according to Futuresource Consulting. Alphabet now has a 59% share, compared with Microsoft\u2019s 22%.  In addition to competing on price, Alphabet and Microsoft devices have gained ground in classrooms by offering a strong mobile-device management system that helps IT departments block students from exiting a browser during a test, Mr. Davis said.  Apple on Tuesday announced a system to enable students to share iPads, so they can log into any tablet and reach their own documents and apps. It said Apple\u2019s school management system would allow schools to create as many as 1,500 Apple IDs in minutes. The company also said it was expanding free iCloud storage for schools to 200 gigabytes from 5 GB.  The new Schoolwork app is coupled with a developer platform called ClassKit that developers can use to create apps that teachers can assign to students. It also announced a new curriculum called \u201cEveryone Can Create\u201d that allows teachers to integrate drawing, music, filmmaking and photography into lessons.  \u201cEducation is such a big part of who we are as a company and has been for 40 years,\u201d Mr. Cook said. \u201cTechnology can help teachers deliver a unique and personalized learning experience to all kids. We\u2019ve never stopped believing that.\u201d  While the iPad remains popular with children and teachers, educators have expressed frustration that they must seek out curriculum apps, rather than getting a simple suite of apps as Google provides, said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst with market-research firm Creative Strategies.  \u201cThey have done a lot on manageability, which will make a big difference\u201d for many schools, Ms. Milanesi said. \u201cWhile price has not changed for iPad, you get a lot more with it.\u201d  Write to Tripp Mickle at Tripp.Mickle@wsj.com", "stock": "AAPL"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-to-begin-selling-delayed-homepod-speaker-1516717905", "label": -1, "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "date": "2018-01-23", "article": "Apple Inc.

Market leaders Amazon.com Inc. AMZN -1.22% and Alphabet Inc. GOOGL -0.12% continued to sell Echo and Google Home devices during the holidays, while Apple worked on a rival product it said wasn\u2019t ready for sale.  Amazon was the first major tech company to enter the smart-speaker market in late 2014, opening a wide lead by selling more than 20 million Echos even before tallying sales for the recent Christmas season. Its hockey puck-sized Echo Dot is estimated to account for more than half of Amazon\u2019s speaker unit sales, largely because of its lower price, which dropped to $30 during the holidays before rising to $50.  The smart-speaker shipments world-wide are expected to rise more than 50% this year to 56 million units, according to the market researcher Canalys. The U.S. will account for more than half of those sales, it said.  At $349, the HomePod costs considerably more than Amazon\u2019s latest Echo and a Google Home, whose list prices are $100 and $129, respectively.  Apple has tried to differentiate its speaker by emphasizing sound quality, particularly when playing music, over the device\u2019s ability to perform tasks.  Voice-activated speakers have moved to the forefront in a battle over what some technology analysts see as the future of computing. Virtual assistants such as Apple\u2019s Siri, Amazon\u2019s Alexa, Microsoft Corp.\u2019s Cortana and Google Assistant are expected to be embedded in more than 4 billion consumer devices by the end of 2018, allowing people to perform simple computing tasks by voice such as searching for information or turning off lights, according to the research firm IHS Markit.  From the Archives In a 2.5-hour keynote, Apple announced a slew of new hardware and software products. WSJ's Joanna Stern recaps what you need to know about the most important announcements (Originally published Sept. 8, 2017) .  Apple\u2019s Siri has a much wider presence by virtue of being featured on more than a billion iPhones and iPads. However, Amazon and Google are aiming to catch up by cutting deals to put their assistants into such products as Toyota Motor Corp. vehicles and Sony Corp. televisions. They also offer greater functionality; Amazon\u2019s Alexa, for example, can perform thousands of commands compared with hundreds by Siri.  The HomePod was the latest in a series of Apple products that faced delayed. The AirPods earbuds missed their promised ship date last year, and the Apple Watch, promised in early 2015, arrived late in April of that year.  Apple said the HomePod initially will be available in the U.S., U.K. and Australia, and will arrive in France and Germany this spring.

The new tablet adds the company\u2019s latest mobile processor with some other upgrades for the same price as its predecessor. That includes a 9% price discount for schools.  Apple last updated its iPad lineup a year ago, culling some offerings while trimming the price on its flagship 9.7-inch version. That didn\u2019t arrest a long-running decline in sales for the pioneering tablet. iPad unit sales fell 4% in the fiscal year ended September, and Wall Street expects another 6% decline for the current year. But Tuesday\u2019s announcement wasn\u2019t simply Apple trying to bolster what is now its fourth-largest business, behind the iPhone, services and Mac in terms of annual revenue. The company has lost significant ground to arch-rival Google in the education market. Apple accounted for nearly half of the laptops and tablets sold in the U.S. K-12 market in 2013, while Google\u2019s Chromebooks accounted for 20%, up from 1% a year earlier, according to Futuresource Consulting. Last year, devices running Google\u2019s Chrome OS accounted for 58% of that market.

Watch the full documentary at wsj.com/docs. (Originally Published June 28, 2017) Altering that trajectory will be a major challenge, even for the world\u2019s most valuable company. Google, owned by Alphabet Inc., GOOGL -0.12% has the advantage of both price and ubiquity. The cheapest Chromebooks are about 40% less than the cheapest iPad, and Google\u2019s G-Suite of services is already widespread in schools. Gmail alone passed the 1-billion-user mark two years ago. Apple\u2019s software often gets high marks. But the company\u2019s software and services only work on its own equipment. That means the company\u2019s prospects are always closely tied to its ability to sell devices. And since those devices still drive the majority of Apple\u2019s operating profits, the company can\u2019t really afford to compete on price. Google, which doesn\u2019t even make most of the Chromebooks bearing its operating system, has no such limitations. Apple\u2019s approach has served it well overall. But in budget-constrained markets like education, the right price isn\u2019t always one the company can meet.

Real-estate private equity firm Walton Street Capital has hired Eastdil Secured to market the Norman Foster-designed Apple Store that opened last fall and has become a popular new attraction along the reinvigorated Chicago River waterfront.  Walton last year paid $370 million for the Apple Store, which at the time was under development, along with 401 N. Michigan Ave., the 35-story office and retail building next door.  Now the firm is hoping to sell the 20,000-square-foot Apple Store along with 10,000-square-feet of retail space in the office building for as much as $175 million, according to people familiar with the offering.  Walton would retain the office space. Real-estate investors often buy mixed-use properties and then split off the valuable retail space and sell it separately.  Eastdil and potential buyers of the Apple Store were having preliminary discussions last week at the global Mipim real estate conference in Cannes, France, according to people at the conference. Eric Mogentale, managing principal of Walton, declined comment.  The sale comes at a time when retail real-estate in general is under enormous pressure because of competition from online shopping and the contraction and failure of many big name retailers. Values of many malls and shopping centers have been falling.  Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s CEO, attended the store opening. Photo: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg News  But Apple Stores have long been the gold standard in the retail world because of the high traffic they attract. Not only do they ring up strong sales, but they also boost traffic and sales at neighboring stores.  A report by Green Street Advisors in 2016 found that average sales for 220 malls with Apple Stores came to $710 per square foot, compared with $630 per square foot for malls without Apple Stores. The study was based on a database that covered about 1,400 properties.  Apple is well aware of the power of its brand and uses it to negotiate low rents. The rent it is paying for the new Apple Store in Chicago is well below the average $400 to $500 per square foot being paid nearby along Michigan Avenue, in an upscale retail area known as the Magnificent Mile, said people familiar with the matter.  Apple began discussing the new Chicago store more than two years ago with Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who has made development of the Chicago River waterfront a big priority. More than $60 million was spent on the standalone store, which has a 32-foot-tall glass fa\u00e7ade and a thin carbon roof.  The project included the redevelopment of the surrounding plaza area so that now Michigan Avenue is linked to the riverfront by granite staircases on either side of the store. The plaza, once cut off from the water, now \u201cflows effortlessly down to the river,\u201d Jony Ive, Apple\u2019s chief design officer, said when the store opened.  The store opened in October in a ceremony attended by Mr. Emanuel and Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook.  Apple officials describe the store as the company\u2019s most ambitious partly because of its design and its connection to the river. The store is also bringing in well-known professionals to teach Apple device users about the products, an experience that isn\u2019t available at most other Apple stores around the world.

Apple on Wednesday said an update to its operating system for iPhones and iPads this spring will include a new \u201cHealth Records\u201d feature that will import and store medical information covering allergies, conditions, immunizations, lab results, medications, procedures and vitals.  A dozen hospitals are participating, including Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore, Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles and Penn Medicine in Philadelphia.  The effort to securely simplify and democratize health records won\u2019t be easy, say physicians who watched Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google wrestle with similar efforts over the years.  Apple\u2019s late arrival to medical records, though, gives it advantages its rivals didn\u2019t enjoy, physicians say, including the benefits of more consolidated hospital networks and concentration among medical-record systems.  \u201cApple is in the right spot,\u201d said Eric Topol, author of \u201cThe Creative Destruction of Medicine\u201d and a physician at the nonprofit Scripps Research Institute. \u201cThere\u2019s a long ways to go still,\u201d he said.  Starting in 2011, the U.S. government spent an estimated $40 billion in stimulus money on health-care information technology, according to McKinsey, encouraging doctors and hospitals to install electronic-medical-records systems and triggering a massive shift toward electronic health information.  Apple said it has secured participation from two of the U.S.\u2019s largest medical-records providers, Epic Systems Corp. and Cerner Corp., which account for more than 50% of medical-records management, as well as Athenahealth Inc., ATHN -1.51% which accounts for almost 2%, according to KLAS Research, which analyzes the industry.  But Apple needs to get more hospitals to share data in order for the Health Records feature to be valuable, said Noga Leviner, co-founder of PicnicHealth, a startup that helps patients consolidate their medical records.  Some hospitals in the same system use different variations of electronic medical records\u2014even from the same provider\u2014and oftentimes don\u2019t have agreements to share data, Ms. Leviner said. People want complete medical-records information\u2014not just records from only one of their six doctors, she said.  \u201cThe government spent $40 billion on this and they failed\u201d to bring those hospitals together, Ms. Leviner said.  Another challenge: expanding information beyond simple listings such as allergies and recent lab results, she said. Tens of millions of Americans with chronic conditions need far more detailed information, such as pathology reports for cancer patients or medical images for people with knee injuries.  Apple\u2019s push into medical records is its latest effort to break into the $3.2 trillion U.S. health-care market. Last year, the company announced its first medical study of heart rhythms using the Apple Watch and it launched HealthKit in 2014, providing a way for different health apps to share information.  HealthKit helped Apple earn the trust of physicians and hospitals since it includes standards that comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, said Richard Milani, a physician at Ochsner Health System in New Orleans who focuses on tech in health care, and works with Apple.  Dr. Milani said HealthKit helped create a secure system that can be used to transfer medical records to the Health Records feature. Apple said Health Records will encrypt patients\u2019 information to protect their privacy.  Apple also is adopting the leading standard for transferring electronic records known as the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources, or FHIR, making it easier for hospitals and medical-records vendors to share information with the iPhone maker, he said.  Apple said it won\u2019t receive any health-record data. Instead, users will be able to add a health provider on their phone and import their records directly from the provider to the device. The company said the system is the same it uses for corporate email, allowing information to go from a corporate server directly to the phone without Apple ever seeing it.  Users will be able to back up their health records to iCloud, and that information will be encrypted with only users having the key to the data on their device.  Apple said it has no plans to monetize Health Records and designed the feature to create a better health experience for users.  Dr. Milani said the company has told hospitals the same thing. \u201cThe only way to monetize this is to say, \u2018We offer something a competitor doesn\u2019t offer to sell more devices,\u2019\u201d he said.  If it works, Health Records could ease a burden on patients, Dr. Milani said. He envisions a future where an iPhone user from Louisiana might be on vacation in Michigan and in need of medical treatment. Rather than the hospital having to look up that patient\u2019s records, the patient can pull them up on a phone.  \u201cThis is a consumer-empowerment move,\u201d Dr. Milani said. \u201cYou\u2019ll have all the information about you and you\u2019ll control it, and that\u2019s exactly who should control it.\u201d  Write to Tripp Mickle at Tripp.Mickle@wsj.com", "stock": "AAPL"}, {"url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-cambodia/facebook-runs-into-lawsuit-over-cambodian-politics-idUSKBN1FT1PB", "label": 1, "source": "reuters", "date": "2018-02-09", "article": "PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Former Cambodian opposition leader Sam Rainsy has filed a legal case in the United States to get Facebook to release information on Prime Minister Hun Sen\u2019s use of the social media platform, his legal team said.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo  Lawyers for Sam Rainsy, who fled Cambodia in 2015 to escape a conviction for defamation he says was politically motivated, said he sought the information to help him in his own legal cases in Cambodia.  Supporters of Hun Sen have built a strong presence on Facebook.  Sam Rainsy wants information on allegations of \u201cfalse likes\u201d on Hun Sen\u2019s Facebook account, accusations that the platform had been used to make death threats and the use of state money for advertisements, his legal team said in a statement on Wednesday.  Government spokesman Phay Siphan said the lawsuit was \u201cnot useful\u201d.  The case highlights the growing global nature of the challenge to Facebook Inc over its role in political debate after accusations that social media was used for meddling in votes in Britain, the United States and elsewhere.  Facebook has become an ever more important platform for political news in Cambodia as some media outlets critical of Hun Sen have been forced to shut.  Hun Sen, 65, has been criticized by Western countries over a ban on the main opposition party and the arrest of its leader less than a year away from a general election on July 29.  Paris-based Sam Rainsy sought \u201ccritical information in Facebook\u2019s possession regarding Hun Sen\u2019s misuse of social media to deceive Cambodia\u2019s electorate and to commit human rights abuses,\u201d according to the statement.  \u201cThe petition raises fundamental questions about how Facebook should deal with human rights abusers who manipulate elections,\u201d said Sam Rainsy\u2019s attorney, Richard J. Rogers, of rights group Global Diligence LLP.  Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the case, which Sam Rainsy\u2019s lawyers said had been brought in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.  Hun Sen\u2019s Facebook profile was private, the Cambodian government spokesman added.  \u201cThe Facebook profile of the Samdech Prime Minister is private, it\u2019s not a terrorist group to cause any insecurity with any country,\u201d said Phay Siphan, using the official title for Hun Sen, who has ruled Cambodia for more than 33 years.  Facebook, which has more than 2 billion users globally, tells advertisers they have the potential to reach 6.6 million people in Cambodia, from a population of nearly 16 million.  It says more than 5.5 million people have expressed an interest in, or liked, pages related to Hun Sen, of whom 1.8 million are in Cambodia.  Comparable figures for Sam Rainsy are 2.2 million people expressing an interest, with 1.7 million within Cambodia.", "stock": "FB"}, {"url": "https://ca.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idCAKBN1F82M2-OCATC", "label": 1, "source": "reuters", "date": "2018-01-19", "article": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc will prioritize \u201ctrustworthy\u201d news in its feed of social media posts, using member surveys to identify high-quality outlets and fight sensationalism and misinformation, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said on Friday.  FILE PHOTO: Facebook Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks on stage during the annual Facebook F8 developers conference in San Jose, California, U.S., April 18, 2017. REUTERS/Stephen Lam/File Photo  The company, which has more than 2 billion monthly users, said its members, not experts or Facebook executives, would determine how news outlets rank in terms of trustworthiness. It also said it would put an emphasis on local news sources.  The move is likely to send shockwaves through the media landscape in nearly every country, given the ubiquity of the world\u2019s largest social network and how central it has become in some places to the distribution of news.  Zuckerberg said on Friday he expects recently announced changes to shrink the amount of news on Facebook by 20 percent, to about 4 percent of all content from 5 percent currently.  The chief executive outlined the shakeup in a post on Facebook, saying that starting next week the News Feed, the company\u2019s centerpiece product, would prioritize \u201chigh quality news\u201d over less trusted sources.  \u201cThere\u2019s too much sensationalism, misinformation and polarization in the world today,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote.  \u201cSocial media enables people to spread information faster than ever before, and if we don\u2019t specifically tackle these problems, then we end up amplifying them,\u201d he wrote.  The quality of news on Facebook has been called into question after alleged Russian operatives, for-profit spammers and others spread false reports on the site, including during the 2016 U.S. election campaign.  Two years ago, Facebook users saw hoaxes saying Pope Francis endorsed Republican Donald Trump for U.S. president and that a federal agent investigating Democrat Hillary Clinton was found dead. Facebook initially proposed fighting false stories by letting users flag them.  The change will affect not only links posted by news outlets but also news stories that individuals share, Facebook said.  News organizations immediately began considering how they would fare in the ranking.  FIGHTING FAKE NEWS  The trust ranking will help to address fake news stories, said David Chavern, president of the News Media Alliance, a trade group for old-line U.S. newspapers.  \u201cFor some time, we have argued that Facebook should give priority to news from trusted sources,\u201d he said in a statement.  Tom Gara, opinion editor at BuzzFeed News, wrote on Twitter that he expected partisan outlets to fare worse: \u201cThis sounds like extremely good news for news publishers that aren\u2019t hated by one side or the other.\u201d  Facebook has had a stormy relationship with news organizations, especially those with strong political leanings. In 2016, Republican U.S. lawmakers expressed concern that Facebook, based in liberal Northern California, was suppressing news stories of interest to conservative readers.  Facebook said that ranking by trustworthiness was not intended to directly impact any specific groups of publishers based on their size or ideology.  Zuckerberg said he settled on the idea of surveying Facebook users after rejecting having the company itself rank news outlets\u2019 trustworthiness.  \u201cWe decided that having the community determine which sources are broadly trusted would be most objective,\u201d he wrote in his post.  Facebook said it did not plan to release the survey results because they will represent an incomplete picture of how a story\u2019s position in a person\u2019s feed is determined.  Many factors determine where a post appears in a Facebook user\u2019s News Feed such as subject of the post, who wrote it and who is commenting on it.  Last week, Zuckerberg said the company would change the way it filters posts and videos on News Feed to prioritize what friends and family share.

Facebook said earlier this month it would change its centerpiece News Feed to prioritize what friends and family share, while reducing the amount of non-advertising content from publishers and brands.  Those changes contributed to a fall in quarterly time spent that added up to about 5 percent on Facebook and 4 percent on its platforms including Instagram.  \u201cWe continue to believe that any slowdown in time spent will be compensated for by higher-quality time spent, and that any trimming of ad load will be compensated for by higher ad pricing,\u201d Graham said.  While the number of daily users in the United States and Canada fell for the first time in Facebook\u2019s history, the average price per ad increased 43 percent in quarter.  One reason for the ad dollars to continue to grow strongly through these changes was that Facebook\u2019s ad targeting tools and offerings deliver return-on-investment for advertisers, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak said.  Out of the 46 analysts that cover Facebook\u2019s stock, 37 now rate it at \u201cbuy\u201d or higher, two at \u201chold\u201d and two at \u201csell\u201d or lower.

The Federation of German Consumer Organisations (vzvb) said that Facebook\u2019s default settings and some of its terms of service were in breach of consumer law, and that the court had found parts of the consent to data usage to be invalid.  \u201cFacebook hides default settings that are not privacy-friendly in its privacy center and does not provide sufficient information about it when users register,\u201d said Heiko Duenkel, litigation policy officer at the vzvb.  \u201cThis does not meet the requirement for informed consent.\u201d The vzvb posted a copy of the ruling on its website.

The Federal Cartel Office, in an interim update on an investigation into Facebook, said in December that it objected to the way the company gains access to third-party data when an account is opened.  This includes tapping information from its own WhatsApp and Instagram products - as well as how it tracks which sites its users access.  One concern highlighted by the consumer rights group was that, in Facebook\u2019s app for smartphones, a service was pre-activated that revealed the user\u2019s location to the person they were chatting to.  Also, in the privacy settings, ticks were already placed in boxes that allowed search engines to link to the user\u2019s timeline, meaning that anyone would be able quickly and easily to find a user\u2019s profile.  \u201cThe judges ruled that all five of the default settings on Facebook that vzvb complained about are invalid,\u201d the group said in a statement, adding that several other of Facebook\u2019s terms of use were found to be illegal.", "stock": "FB"}, {"url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-new-york-court-facebook/ny-top-court-says-private-facebook-photos-can-be-disclosed-idUSKCN1FX2L0", "label": 1, "source": "reuters", "date": "2018-02-13", "article": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York state\u2019s highest court ruled on Tuesday that Facebook users may be required to turn over photos and other information that are relevant to litigation, even if they are shielded by \u201cprivacy\u201d settings.

Kelly Forman said she became a recluse after suffering a spinal injury and brain damage, making it hard to read and write, in a June 2011 fall caused by Mark Henkin\u2019s negligence in fitting her horse with a defective stirrup that broke.  To defend himself against Forman\u2019s damages claims, Henkin sought access to her entire \u201cprivate\u201d Facebook account.  In February 2014, a trial judge ordered Forman to give Henkin pre-accident photos she intended to use at trial, post-accident photos not depicting nudity or romantic encounters, and access to post-accident records of her messages.  But in December 2015, a state appeals court limited the disclosure to photos intended for trial, saying Henkin could not go on a \u201cfishing expedition\u201d for evidence.

The case has drawn attention to the central role of Facebook in political discussion in Cambodia, where the government has shut the main opposition party, arrested its leader and cracked down on media and civil rights groups over the past year.

REUTERS/Philippe Wojazer/File Photo  The settlement was filed on Monday in the federal court in Manhattan and won preliminary approval from U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet.  It amounts to a small fraction of Facebook\u2019s current market value of roughly $537 billion as of Monday\u2019s market close.  Shareholders led by the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System and Fresno County Employees\u2019 Retirement Association in California accused Facebook of concealing internal concerns about how growth in mobile devices might reduce revenue, even as it quietly warned its banks to cut their forecasts.  Unlike in 2012, the Menlo Park, California-based company now generates most of its revenue from mobile devices and has estimated that mobile advertising generated more than 86 percent of its $40.7 billion total revenue in 2017.  The settlement resolves claims against Facebook, officials including Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and director Peter Thiel, and bank underwriters covering a five-day period surrounding the $16 billion IPO, from May 17 to May 21, 2012.  Facebook made its market debut on May 18 of that year at $38 per share and saw its share price languish below that level for more than a year before it rebounded.  \u201cResolving this case is in the best interests of the company and our shareholders,\u201d Associate General Counsel Sandeep Solanki said in a statement.  A lawyer for the shareholders did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Sweet scheduled a Sept. 5 hearing to consider final settlement approval.  The accord was reached after mediation, and provides an average recovery of about 11 cents per share, or 7 cents per share after possible legal fees and costs, court papers show.  Insurers may cover some of the payout.  Lawyers for the shareholders called the settlement \u201cfair, reasonable, and adequate,\u201d citing the risk of a loss at trial, according to court papers.

The company is going on a spree. Facebook has said its costs for web video programs, people to patrol the social network for abusive posts, its virtual reality project and other investments will swell by 45 percent to 60 percent this year. Investors are mostly fine with this. The company has justified the spending on its top priorities, including guarding against Russia-backed misinformation campaigns or other abuses.  But there is another category of costs that is likely to increase at a much faster clip, and Facebook hasn't detailed why. The company last week repeated a forecast that its capital costs -- spending on fleets of computer equipment, new corporate buildings and other physical assets -- will more than double, from $6.7 billion in 2017 to an estimated $14 billion to $15 billion in 2018.  Hey, Big Spender Facebook expects its capital expenses will more than double in 2018 Data: Bloomberg and Facebook's 2018 forecast; graphic by Bloomberg Gadfly  Even when Facebook was growing quickly into a titan, its capital costs never doubled from one year to the next. Facebook executives have said the significantly higher capital spending in 2018 will be for computing networks and other investments to \"support growth and improve our products,\" as the company's top finance executive said in November.  That's not much of an explanation for what is both an astounding jump in capital spending and a stunning overall sum. Companies with $14 billion or more in yearly capital expenditures tend to be those that make complex physical products such as computer chips or cars.  Facebook rearranges pixels; it doesn't drill for oil and gas as Exxon Mobil does. And yet Exxon's capital spending is on par with Facebook's 2018 forecast, at about $14.8 billion in the 12 months ended Sept. 30, according to Bloomberg data. Insert the cliche about how \"data is the new oil.\"  Investors have not publicly pressed Facebook to explain how it will spend its 2018 capital budget. They are fixated on far more pressing issues, including the company's effort to weed out harmful behavior on the social network, ward off potential regulatory crackdowns and expand important businesses including internet video and Instagram, the Facebook-owned app. As long as Facebook's financials continue to be healthy, stockholders are likely to remain unconcerned about a big step up in capital costs.  But there is a precedent that should worry Facebook a little. A few years ago, Google's capital spending was growing significantly. It more than doubled in 2013 and surged 49 percent in 2014. To investors, the capital spending increases were among the evidence that Google had become financially undisciplined. The company's stock price declined 5 percent for the year.  Then Google hired a new chief financial officer and imposed a stricter watch on its wallet. Capex declined in 2015 and has increased more slowly ever since. Google's commitment to spending discipline was among the reasons investors regained confidence in it.  Catching Up Facebook may have a bigger tab of capital spending this year than Google's parent company, whose revenue is twice as large Data: Bloomberg and Facebook forecasts; graphic by Bloomberg Gadfly  If Facebook's 2018 capital costs match the company's forecast, it may pass Google parent company Alphabet in capital spending, even though the web search giant's revenue is twice as large. Facebook may also join the ranks of Google, Intel and Apple of the U.S. technology industry's biggest capex spenders. (South Korea's sprawling electronics giant Samsung has by far the largest capex spending of global tech companies.)  Big Leagues Facebook's expected 2018 capital costs would put it among the world's top spending tech companies Data: Bloomberg and Facebook's 2018 forecast; graphic by Bloomberg Gadfly  The rising capex tab for Facebook is another reminder that the world's web habits require costly and complex underlying infrastructure of internet pipes, computers, electricity and people to keep it all humming.  It's also possible Facebook has some secrets up its sleeve that will require a big step up in capital costs. Bloomberg News has reported that Facebook is working on more consumer hardware, including a home videoconferencing device, and those ambitions require new kinds of spending.  Facebook's capital binge hasn't attracted much attention from investors. But if the company's revenue grows more slowly than investors expect, those costs may suddenly look worrisome.

Still, enthusiasm for bitcoin and other volatile digital currencies has minted many millionaires. Public companies have capitalized on the hype, with everything from packaged-food makers to sports-bra manufacturers seeing shares surge after linking their firms to crypto, sometimes just by name.  Earlier this month, Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg referred to cryptocurrencies and other technologies that decentralize power as a trend he was studying in 2018, part of an effort to correct problems on the social network. While some enthusiasts took this as a positive sign for digital currencies, Zuckerberg wrote at the time that he was looking at both the positive and negative aspects of the technology.  Bitcoin has a history of big run-ups in price followed by steep declines. In 2017, it surged more than than 1,700 percent, and almost touched $20,000. Today it trades around $10,000.

The company kept warning that its rate of revenue growth would slow and that its plans to spend more money and remodel Facebook into less of a cesspool would drag down profit margins and perhaps result in people using Facebook less.  Investors learned not to be so concerned about Facebook's predictions of impending doom, although now it looks as if some of those cautions are coming true and outsiders weren't sufficiently braced for it.  Facebook said on Wednesday that its revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 rose 47 percent from a year earlier. Yes, that was (barely) the sixth consecutive quarter of slowing growth for Facebook; but come on, it's impressive for a company of Facebook's size to regularly boost sales at this pace. Out of 300 global companies of Facebook's size, only a few are growing more quickly, Bloomberg data show.  What, Me Worry? Facebook has warned its revenue growth would start to slow by now. It's not much of a slowdown, though. Source: Bloomberg and Facebook  The fourth-quarter revenue performance came despite Facebook's repeated warnings that its advertising sales growth would slow noticeably at this point because of its decision to stop shoving more ads into the Facebook news feed. It's clear that Facebook more than made up the difference thanks to higher ad prices and new types of advertisements that appeal to companies eager to pitch to Facebook's giant audience.  Wall Street does expect Facebook's sales to slow meaningfully soon. Analysts think Facebook's revenue will increase about 33 percent in 2018, according to the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That's slow for Facebook but impressive in any rational world. It makes sense for any company to underpromise and over-deliver. But given how often Facebook has warned investors that its financials will start to look a little less handsome, they may not believe the company if the ugliness really comes this time.  That's more of a worry now because Facebook has started to fire up the alarms about other elements of its business, and those appear to be coming true. CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently said his decision to change the formula to prioritize \"meaningful social interaction\" on Facebook might cause people to spend less time hanging out on the social network.  The company disclosed on Wednesday the slowest rate of growth in its history in the number of daily users. The number of users in North America fell for the first time in the fourth quarter. And Facebook said that the changes it made to play down viral videos and other less-than-optimal programming reduced the time spent on Facebook by roughly 50 million hours each day. That works out to roughly 2 minutes for each of Facebook's 1.4 billion daily users.  Uh Oh In the fourth quarter, Facebook posted its slowest-ever growth rate in daily users Source: Bloomberg and Facebook  In principle, though, even a small reduction isn't good for Facebook's future advertising revenue because the more time people spend on Facebook, the more chances Facebook has to sell paid commercials. Facebook shares dipped about 4 percent in trading after the regular market close before rebounding.  The worry, of course, is that Facebook's second quarter of relatively meek daily user growth may be the result of people's dislike of hanging out on Facebook. And that's an existential threat to Facebook's popularity and its business. That's worthy of five ringing alarms of caution. The changes Facebook made to its news feed were announced after the end of 2017. It seems likely, then, that slowing daily user growth in the fourth quarter wasn't caused by the news feed changes, and that more declines in time spent may be coming.  Other fears have yet to come to pass. Facebook has also said it will spend much more this year on people and technology to oversee posts and advertising, to avoid a repeat of the 2016 Russian-backed misinformation campaigns that remain the subject of congressional inquiry. It also plans to spend more on video programming for its TV-like digital hangout and to build up relatively young businesses including virtual reality and artificial intelligence.  Facebook has warned that this increased spending will hurt its profit margins in 2018, but investors don't seem to believe it. Wall Street's expectations work out to an expected 2018 operating income margin of 43 percent, Bloomberg data show. Facebook ended 2017 by posting a record 57 percent quarterly operating margin. That gives the company room to spend more without dragging its margins to worrisome levels.  Profit Powerhouse Facebook has higher operating profit margins than all but a handful of 500 large U.S. companies Source: Bloomberg  Facebook has been tamping down expectations for so long, investors didn't take seriously enough the company's cries of distress. And as the stock reaction from Facebook's user growth and engagement numbers show, investors weren't prepared for Facebook's warnings to come to fruition.

Facebook wasn\u2019t the first social network, just like Google\u2019s Gmail wasn\u2019t the first email service. Facebook has publicly credited Snapchat for creating the popular \"stories\" function that allows people to post disappearing videos about their days, which is now more popular on Facebook\u2019s properties than it is on Snapchat.  BlackBerry was an early pioneer in messaging. Its proprietary service BBM helped draw millions to its phones in the mid-2000s when the company was a smartphone leader. But the company waited years before opening BBM up to phones running Apple Inc. or Alphabet Inc. operating systems, and as those companies took over the smartphone market, BBM\u2019s popularity faded along with BlackBerry\u2019s devices.

The indictment described a multiyear effort by Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency and others to shape American opinions, including by impersonating Americans on Facebook, Instagram, Google\u2019s YouTube and Twitter Inc.  Mueller described a sophistication beyond what Congress had understood about the Russian meddling in the election. At hearings three months ago, Facebook Inc. was criticized for not quickly becoming suspicious of U.S. election ads purchased in Russian rubles.

They bought stolen bank account numbers online as well, using them to bypass PayPal\u2019s security system and open accounts, with which they bought Facebook ads.  PayPal accounts were used for general expenses, the purchase of advertisements and to buy buttons, flags and banners for the political rallies organized through the social media scheme, according to the indictment.  The ads purchased by Russian actors on Facebook went through an automated buying system, where they are only flagged if they break rules on the social network related to its community standards. The company has since bolstered the team that reviews ads and is planning to add tools to let users know who is behind them.

With Facebook, users post content on the site and the company collects the money -- last year, $41 billion in revenue. On Steemit, the money goes in the other direction. Facebook, with 2.1 billion monthly users, may not even see Steemit, which says 9 million users visit each month, in its rear-view mirror. But Kadavy is just one of hundreds of thousands of people who make money by posting, playing games and viewing ads on the new blockchain-based sites and apps, where nearly every user action is linked to token-based compensation.  More than 1,000 such projects that record data onto digital ledgers and are called dapps, for decentralized applications, are live or in testing. And they often let users earn their special coins or cryptocurrency by doing something they\u2019d already done for nothing on other sites.  Facebook and Twitter didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.  Worth Dollars  Some pre-blockchain sites let users tip content creators from their own funds. Very few did. Sites like Steemit give content creators a portion of newly minted tokens that are being mined all the time. Most of the tokens can be traded on exchanges, so they\u2019re worth something in dollars. And like Steem, many of these coins have appreciated. Steem stands at $3.55, up from 11 cents a year ago.  Tokens are a big reason why two-year-old Steemit already has about 100,000 content creators, according to Chief Executive Officer Ned Scott. It just broke into the top 1,000 of the web\u2019s biggest sites, according to tracker Alexa.  Steem Token's Market Cap In the Past Year In Billions of Dollars Source: CoinMarketCap.com  \u201cI attribute almost all of Steemit\u2019s growth to the reality it\u2019s distributed money to members of the community,\u201d Scott said in an interview. \u201cThere\u2019s been very little marketing. It\u2019s been all organic conversations that have led to the growth of the platform. A majority of the people who continue to stick around are being compensated for their time.\u201d  Financial Internet in Infancy  Scott, a former financial analyst for a food-importing company, got Steemit off the ground with a $250,000 angel investment. The site doesn\u2019t sell ads. Instead, it owns a portion of the issued tokens.  This new financial Internet is still in its infancy. It pays users a total of $3.5 million, but within two years, users could be paid $50 million a year, according to Susan Eustis, CEO of WinterGreen Research. The market could expand to $180 million within five years, she said in an email. Billionaire investor Tim Draper said that tokens and cryptocurrencies will grab 33 percent of all commerce in the next 10 years.  Sites such as Facebook and Twitter could benefit immediately by allowing users to tip content providers in Bitcoin, Draper, one of the world\u2019s biggest investors in digital money, said in an email.  Money for Playing  While games such as Zynga Inc.\u2019s FarmVille have long used virtual currencies, the money can\u2019t be taken out of the games. That\u2019s not the case with tokens. Services like Bancor can convert an obscure token into one that can be traded on an exchange. In a sign of the financial internet\u2019s traction, conversion volume on the Bancor network has climbed to more than $37 million per week in January from $3 million per week in November, according to the company.  Startup Storj pays people to store files for others on unused hard-drive space. Golem will soon let users get paid for letting artists do renderings by using their computers\u2019 power. Users are already making money by taking polls and designing stickers for teen favorite Kik Messenger. Matchpool is set up to let people get paid for matching singles for dates, or for connecting companies with advisers. Augur, which is in beta testing, rewards users for correctly predicting future events. CryptoKitties, a digital game, is a platform for people to collect and breed virtual cats -- and to sell the virtual kittens.  Privacy Rules  CryptoKitties \u201cactually turned out to be my most profitable crypto asset,\u201d player Michael Rinderman, 26, said in an email. Since starting to play the game in early 2018, he turned an investment of one Ether into 10 Ethers; each Ether is currently worth $868.  Obstacles stand in the way of the financial internet. New privacy rules in Europe require sites to erase user information under certain circumstances. That could be problematic, as the blockchain is immutable and usually can\u2019t be changed easily.  Digital ledgers could also make it difficult to take down libelous content because it lives forever there, said Samit Singh, CEO of Decentralized News Network, an online publisher that\u2019s in alpha testing.  More importantly, most digital ledgers have problems scaling as more users jump on board. Recently, Ethereum blockchain screeched to a halt as too many users began playing CryptoKitties.  \u201cThese decentralized systems are just not made to grow and scale for the masses yet,\u201d said Anthony Di Iorio, co-founder of Ethereum, said in an interview. \u201cThere are always problems with early technology. It takes time.\u201d  But, he notes, it\u2019s worth the wait. \u201cThis will be more important than the internet,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be massively disruptive for every sector.\u201d", "stock": "FB"}, {"url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-26/facebook-can-t-avoid-privacy-lawsuit-over-biometric-face-prints", "label": -1, "source": "bloomberg", "date": "2018-02-26", "article": "Facebook Inc. failed again to get out of a lawsuit alleging its photo scanning technology flouts users\u2019 privacy rights.  A federal judge in San Francisco ruled Monday that the world\u2019s largest social network must face claims that it violated the privacy of millions of users by gathering and storing biometric data without their consent. Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google is fighting similar claims in federal court in Chicago.  U.S. District Judge James Donato\u2019s decision to let the class-action case proceed means that Facebook is still potentially on the hook for fines under a unique Illinois law of $1,000 to $5,000 each time a person\u2019s image is used without permission. A court victory for consumers could lead to new restrictions on Facebook\u2019s use of biometrics in the U.S., similar to those in Europe and Canada.  \u201cWhen an online service simply disregards the Illinois procedures, as Facebook is alleged to have done, the right of the individual to maintain her biometric privacy vanishes into thin air,\u201d Donato wrote in Monday\u2019s ruling. \u201cThe precise harm the Illinois legislature sought to prevent is then realized.\u201d  Donato previously rejected Facebook\u2019s argument that the case had to be dismissed because the attempt to enforce Illinois law runs afoul of its user agreement that requires disputes to be resolved under the laws of California, where it\u2019s based.  Facebook Says Users Can\u2019t Stop It From Using Biometric Data  Courts have struggled over what qualifies as an injury to pursue a privacy case in lawsuits accusing Facebook and Google of siphoning users\u2019 personal information from emails and monitoring their web browsing habits. Suits over selling the data to advertisers have often failed.  In 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court set a \u201cconcrete injury\u201d standard for privacy suits in a case involving search-engine operator Spokeo Inc., a ruling that both sides in the Facebook suit attempted to use to their advantage.  The Illinois residents who sued under the Biometric Information Privacy Act said the 2008 state law gives them a \u201cproperty interest\u201d in the algorithms that constitute their digital identities -- in other words, gives them grounds to accuse Facebook of real harm.  Facebook, which got the case moved to San Francisco from Illinois, argued the users hadn\u2019t suffered a concrete injury such as physical harm, loss of money or property; or a denial of their right to free speech or religion.  Donato concluded that the alleged violation of the user-consent requirement in the Illinois law goes to \u201cthe very privacy rights the Illinois legislature sought to protect.\u201d  \u201cThis injury is worlds away from the trivial harm of a mishandled zip code or credit card receipt,\u201d he wrote.  A spokeswoman for Facebook declined to comment on the ruling.

The revelation comes after a former employee wrote an article for Wired that posited a theory: since Facebook ads are sold through a bidding system, and Trump was targeting people in more rural areas, he likely paid less per ad to reach those people. That prompted a tweet from Brad Parscale, the Trump campaign\u2019s digital director in the 2016 campaign, who was quick to take credit for the efficiency and claiming that he was sure their ads were at least 100 times cheaper. Clinton said the unfair nature of the system needed to be analyzed.  But from June to November 2016, Trump actually spent slightly more for reach in most of those months, according to a chart tweeted out Tuesday by Facebook executive Andrew Bosworth.

The proposal, written by Ellen Weintraub, a Democrat and vice chair of the commission, would require online advertisements to carry the same disclaimers from their sponsors as do radio, television and print ads. The commission will consider the framework, known as a notice of proposed rule making, at its next public hearing on March 8.  The move comes as tech companies face growing scrutiny in Washington ranging from concerns about market dominance to concerns that online platforms are used for sex trafficking of children.  Congress has been examining how Russians used social media platforms to influence the 2016 election, and bipartisan bills have been introduced in both the House and Senate that would require companies like Facebook and Google to disclose information about sponsors of political ads on their sites, including how much they\u2019re spending and what audiences the ads are focusing on.    FEC Disclaimers  Though the FEC proposal, which was shared by Weintraub, would apply to campaigns, political parties and other organizations that try to influence federal elections, tech companies could also be affected. They might have to adapt their platforms to accommodate the kind of disclaimers the FEC envisions.  In 2011, Facebook asked the FEC for an exemption from disclaimer rules because its ads used a \"sponsored\" tag that did not identify the sponsor, and did not necessarily link back to the sponsor\u2019s website. The election commission deadlocked on granting an exemption.  In the wake of revelations that Facebook, Google and other online sites were used by Russians in 2015 and 2016 to influence Americans on hot button social and political issues, the FEC reopened the rule making process to require more disclosure for online ads. The draft rule would require text and graphic ads to include the name of a sponsor \"in letters of sufficient size to be clearly readable.\"  Political ads on streaming music services or Internet radio stations would have to include oral disclaimers, while candidates buying online video and audio ads would have to state their names and add, \"And I approve of this message.\"  Paid Advertisements  The notice also seeks input on whether political organizations that use free services -- like uploading videos to YouTube -- should be required to say they are responsible for the ads. Under current law, disclaimers are only required on paid advertisements.  The notice, which will require the support of Republican commissioners to be adopted, also tries to anticipate how developing technologies, including virtual and augmented reality, should be regulated.  The last time the FEC issued a ruling on internet advertising was in 2006, the year after YouTube was founded. That ruling required individuals and committees buying online political ads to disclose how much they spent on the ads. It also called for a disclaimer for all \"paid Internet advertising placed on another person\u2019s website,\" such as banner ads. The requirement exempted other forms of Internet communications, such as blog posts.  The six-member commission, which enforces election laws, can include no more than three members from one party. Currently there are three Republicans, one Democrat and one independent. Lee Goodman, a Republican, is stepping down Friday, which will create two vacancies. FEC rules will require four votes to adopt or propose rules.", "stock": "FB"}, {"url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-stock-price-rallies-ahead-of-earnings-2018-1", "label": 1, "source": "business-insider", "date": "2018-01-31", "article": "Paul Sakuma/AP  Wall Street expects Facebook to deliver earnings of $1.95 a share on revenue of $12.54 billion.

Current users may be exposed to more Watch videos with Facebook's News Feed tweaks. Morgan Stanley's survey didn't include data on average time spent viewing Facebook Watch, but Watch video engagement could increase as Facebook prioritizes longer serialized content in the News Feed. This can help offset declining video views caused by Facebook's recently announced News Feed algorithm tweak, which de-prioritizes publisher content.  But Watch has a long way to go to catch up with YouTube viewership. Seventy-eight percent of respondents indicated they used YouTube in the past year, while this figure was just 43% for Facebook Watch. That's not surprising, as YouTube has been around since 2005 and claims over 1 billion daily video views. Nonetheless, the adoption figures of Watch indicate Facebook is achieving its goal of converting more of its users into \"lean-back\" video viewers, as opposed to users who passively consume short-form video in the News Feed. Facebook is poised to boost Watch viewership as it broadens its exclusive TV-like content library.

Facebook fit that criteria for 27% of respondents, coming in second behind Marlboro, which 43% of people said had negative effects. McDonald's and Walmart came in at 21% and 18%, respectively, while 36% of people said \"None of the above.\"  Tavis McGinn, founder of Honest Data, wrote on LinkedIn that the findings weren't entirely surprising, given how much negative press Facebook has received in recent months.  \"In the social sphere, people began to question the long-term impact of Facebook on the psychological well-being of users,\" McGinn wrote, noting that violent crimes and suicide have been broadcast on Facebook Live and that former Facebook executives have publicly condemned the platform as addictive and socially destructive.

Zuckerberg told Dubner that Facebook, in his view, has a responsibility to work on connecting people across ideological divides. He said that while he believes most people mean to do well by each other, \"confronting truths or perspectives that don'\u0092t fit with ours\" can cause people to lash out.

The tech giant recently topped Glassdoor's 2018 Employees' Choice Awards, and a whopping 94% of Facebook employees who've left reviews on Glassdoor would recommend the company to a friend. That's why Facebook VP of HR Janelle Gale is set to address how the company keeps its employees happy and engaged at Glassdoor's Best Places to Work Tour.  Gale said job candidates with an interest in Facebook shouldn't second guess themselves. Instead, you should just find a role that you know you'd truly enjoy, and apply. It's as simple as that.  \"Make sure that's the central part of your story, because we're looking for the thing you enjoy,\" she told Business Insider. \"We may ask you, 'Tell us about a time when time flew for you when you were working on a project?' because that is a signal for us. That is work you are going to be good at because you enjoy it.\"  She also cleared up two major misconceptions about landing a job at Facebook:", "stock": "FB"}, {"url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-facebooks-onavo-protect-virtual-private-network-app-2018-2", "label": 1, "source": "business-insider", "date": "2018-02-14", "article": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg delivers the keynote address at Facebook's F8 Developer Conference on April 18, 2017 at McEnery Convention Center in San Jose, California. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images  Facebook is now directing users to download a VPN called Onavo for \"protection.\"  The VPN is owned by Facebook, and sends information about your app usage habits to the company.  Facebook has used this tool for a competitive advantage against other mobile apps.  Critics say Facebook isn't clear enough about its ownership of Onavo.  Under the pretense of protecting your account, Facebook is telling users download to a Facebook-owned app that tracks what you do on your phone \u2014 and sends that information back to Facebook.  TechCrunch first noticed on Tuesday that Facebook added a menu item, called \"protect,\" to its iPhone and iOS app. Clicking it takes users directly to the App Store listing of a Virtual Private Network (VPN) app called Onavo Protect, which is owned by Facebook.  Facebook bought Onavo, an Israeli company, in 2013. Since then, Facebook has been using the data collected from the service to keep tabs on how people use the apps on their phones, even when they're not using Facebook.  For example, the company used Onavo to see that Snapchat saw declining usage after Facebook introduced the competing Instagram Stories feature, The Wall Street Journal reported. It was also data from Onavo that reportedly inspired Facebook to launch a group video chat feature to its Messenger app\u2014 stymying a smaller app called Houseparty, which provided a very similar feature.  However, critics say that Facebook isn't clear enough about its affiliation with Onavo, implying that users might never know that the company uses the data from the app for such purposes.  Facebook did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment. Erez Naveh, Product Manager at Onavo, told TechCrunch that the app collects mobile data traffic to \"help us recognize tactics that bad actors use.\" Naveh also noted that the app lets people know it collects data before users download it.  Here's what Onavo actually does \u2014 and why people are upset that Facebook is pushing it.  Facebook's Onavo is a Virtual Private Network, or VPN  Onavo is a Virtual Private Network, or a VPN.  There are several VPNs out there, and they essentially all do the same thing: route your internet traffic through a third-party server.  Facebook's iOS app now displays a \"protect\" option that links directly to Onavo's App Store listing. Screenshot  This allows users to to mask their browsing activity from Internet Service Providers, like Comcast and AT&T. It can also make your computer look like it's in a different location, depending on where the third-party server is. Typically, VPNs themselves encrypt your traffic, making it harder for people to snoop on your activity.  Many VPNs are paid services \u2014 the popular AnchorFree Hotspot Shield, for instance, charges $13 a month, or $120 a year. Others, like Onavo Protect, are totally free for (mostly) unlimited usage.  When users download Onavo, they give Facebook permission to collect their mobile data traffic. Because Facebook owns Onavo, Facebook gets access to that data. This means that while your ISP won't see what apps you're using, Facebook will. If you're using Onavo, and you spend two hours on Twitter a day, Facebook can see that.  Why does this have people worried?  The major criticism of Onavo Protect is that Facebook isn't clear enough about its affiliation with the app. Unless you tap the \"Read More\" button in the App Store description of Onavo, you might never know it was actually owned by Facebook itself.  \"As part of this process, Onavo collects your mobile data traffic. This helps us improve and operate the Onavo service by analyzing your use of websites, apps and data. Because we're part of Facebook, we also use this info to improve Facebook products and services, gain insights into the products and services people value, and build better experiences,\" the description of the app reads.  The average user may not read the entire app description and download the service without knowing that it is giving Facebook access to your mobile browsing data, say critics.  John Gruber, a prominent Apple blogger, called Onavo \"spyware,\" likening it malicious software that hackers deploy to spy on users. Dell Cameron, a reporter at Gizmodo, called the VPN service \"vampiric\" and told readers not to download the app.  Facebook already has issues with eroding public trust, amid its public struggles with fake news, propaganda, and misinformation spreading through the social network. The perception that the company is pushing what's seen as a way to spy on users may not be the best look.", "stock": "FB"}, {"url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/snap-stock-price-rises-on-report-snapchat-is-pulling-younger-users-away-from-facebook-2018-2", "label": 1, "source": "business-insider", "date": "2018-02-12", "article": "Lucy Nicholson/Reuters  Snap shares were rising on news that it was taking younger users away from Facebook, according to the marketing firm eMarketer.  Still, Facebook was adding total monthly users, though mostly from an older cohort.  Snap is poised to add more users this year than ever given its new app redesign.  Watch Snap's stock trade in real time here.    Snap shares were gaining ground after a report found that Facebook was losing younger users at a faster clip to Snapchat than previously expected.  Snap's stock was up 2.23% on Monday morning at $19.22 a share.  \"While the social media platform was able to count on Instagram to retain that younger audience in the past, Snapchat may now be siphoning away more users,\" according to the eMarketer study.  Social media companies have closely monitored millennials, particularly teenagers, because they represent a large base of sustainable growth.  Yet Facebook is still popular among older age groups, adding monthly users overall. The New York-based marketing firm eMarketer believes Facebook will add around 1% more users in 2018, compared to the previous year.  However, the study found that Facebook will lose 9.3% of US Facebook users between ages 11 and younger. Meanwhile, the number of Facebook users ages 12 to 17 will decline by 5.6% and users aged 18 to 24 will fall by 5.8% in 2018. Facebook would lose up to 2 million users under the age of 24 this year, according to the eMarketer study.  Facebook's stock was up 0.82% at $177.55 per share ahead of Monday's opening bell.  \u201cSnapchat could eventually experience more growth in older age groups, since it\u2019s redesigning its platform to be easier to use,\u201d eMarketer principal analyst Debra Aho Williamson stated in a release. \u201cThe question will be whether younger users will still find Snapchat cool if more of their parents and grandparents are on it. That\u2019s the predicament Facebook is in.\u201d  Snapchat may see its user base grow by 9.3% to 86.5 million this year, eMarketer added.

That\u2019s the way you match with someone on Tinder. You like them, they like you, you both find out and get connected. But to date, the feature\u2019s largely been trapped in dating apps that match you with randos or that not everyone wants to be on. That means this anti-loneliness technology is leaving some people out.  Facebook, meanwhile, is on a newfound quest to stimulate \u201cmeaningful interactions,\u201d not just passive content consumption. Its latest attempt is a ham-handed Meetups feature. It surfaces big groups of friends saying some might want to hang out with you, and asking if you\u2019re interested. If you both say yes, it connects you over Messenger.  The idea behind Meetups is smart, but the execution is a mess. Because Meetups ambiguously shows multiple people at once, sends aggressive notifications to participate and encompasses all kinds of relationships, the results are meaningless. You don\u2019t know if someone \u201cchose you\u201d because they actually like you, want to chill platonically, actually were approving of another friend shown at the same time or were just mindlessly clicking through after getting an alert to try the confusing feature.  For years I\u2019ve been writing about how Facebook and Messenger should build an offline availability indicator for finding out who\u2019s free to spend time with in person. Messenger\u2019s new test of \u201cYour Emoji,\u201d where you can put a beer mug, or dinner plate, or briefcase on your profile pic for 24 hours to indicate what you\u2019re up to or interested in doing, is a much better approach.  But it\u2019s not designed for dating. And let\u2019s be real. Finding a significant other is the source of some of the most meaningful interactions you\u2019ll ever have. If Facebook can be the matchmaker, it will accomplish its mission while earning tremendous good will from those paired up. And unlike dating apps that become needless to people once they successfully get into a relationship, it doesn\u2019t matter to Facebook if you never use the feature again.  That\u2019s why Facebook should build a \u201cMatchmaker\u201d feature into its profiles.  It\u2019d be completely voluntary from the start. If you\u2019re romantically interested in someone, you could hit a button on their profile that they\u2019ve opted in to displaying. If they hit the button on yours too, Facebook lets you both know.  Here\u2019s the tricky part, or technically, the simple part. Facebook shouldn\u2019t blast you with tons of notifications teasing that someone likes you. It shouldn\u2019t try to get you to guess who it was from a short-list of people. And it shouldn\u2019t push you to swipe through all your friends. It should be subtle. Otherwise, some users, especially women who typically get the majority of inbound interest from men on dating apps, may feel pestered, ogled or even objectified. That\u2019s why many people stray away from sleazy dating apps like Bang With Friends that try to match you via your social graph.  Some will surely cringe at the idea of Facebook getting more deeply involved with our romantic lives. Others might think it\u2019s redundant with Pokes, walls, messages and other ways to connect, even though those are either unclear signals or lack the privacy and protection against unwanted advances of double opt-in. And, understandably, some just wouldn\u2019t want to mix romance into a friendship platform. There\u2019s certainly the risk of creepy dudes following up via message like \u201cI right-swiped you\u2026\u201d Getting this wrong could drive people away from Facebook all together.  But done right, Facebook Matchmaker would hardly exist for anyone who doesn\u2019t want it. It wouldn\u2019t generate tons of unrequited \u201cYes\u201d swipes. And it\u2019d only result in rare matches. But those matches would be meaningful, because they weren\u2019t coerced, and they didn\u2019t occur on an app designed for finding one-night hookups. They\u2019d be people from whom you already accepted friend requests, in your network, with whom you might already have a lot in common.  I\u2019m increasingly hearing from friends over 30 that they\u2019re anxious they won\u2019t ever find a partner. But we\u2019ve lost many of the other cultural institutions that used to pair us up 100 years ago.  Globalization of opportunity leads people to leave their home towns. Secularization and the rise of science mean fewer people are connected through places of worship. Multi-generational housing has fallen out of fashion so young adults don\u2019t live with parents and grandparents who could match them with a partner. The positive shift toward women pursuing their own careers leads some to push marriage to later in life. People are spending longer on higher education and prioritizing jobs over family.  And now when we feel lonely, when we might have sought in-person companionship, we have phones full of feeds, memes and games to keep us company.  Facebook\u2019s made it easier than ever to \u201cfeel connected,\u201d endlessly scrolling through friends\u2019 photos, while actually allowing us to isolate ourselves. Matchmaker is its chance to fulfill the most fundamental purpose of what we used to call \u201csocial networks.\u201d", "stock": "FB"}, {"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/02/03/facebooks-siren-call/", "label": -1, "source": "techcrunch", "date": "2018-02-03", "article": "Big news outlets stupidly sold their soul to Facebook. Desperate for the referral traffic Facebook dangled, they spent the past few years jumping through its hoops only to be cut out of the equation. Instead of developing an owned audience of homepage visitors and newsletter subscribers, they let Facebook brainwash readers into thinking it was their source of information.  Now Facebook is pushing into local news, but publishers should be wary of making the same crooked deal. It might provide more exposure and traffic for smaller outlets today, but it could teach users they only need to visit Facebook for local news in the future. Here\u2019s how Facebook retrained us over the past 12 years to drain the dollars out of news.  Users first is Facebook first later  To be clear, Facebook\u2019s intention, that I believe to be earnest, is to foster stronger ties between its users and their communities to boost well-being. But that doesn\u2019t mean ripple effects are positive. The critical lens through which to view all of Facebook\u2019s strategy is that in the short term it puts users first, itself second and everyone else a distant, distant third. That includes developers, advertisers and definitely news publishers.  This strategy is actually self-serving in the long term, though, because Facebook only continues to dominate because its users don\u2019t leave. Back in 2010, Facebook decimated the virality of game developers like Zynga, which made lots of money because their News Feed spam threatened to push people away from the social network. That short-term hit to the bottom line paved the way for the depth of engagement that fuels quarters where Facebook earns $4 billion today.  This explains CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s recent announcement that Facebook would make changes to enhance well-being even if it decreased time spent on the site or its ad revenue. Those consequences may be true in the short term. But it\u2019s a shrewd tactic when you zoom out. Left unchecked, the \u201cTime Well Spent\u201d movement could metastasize into a \u201cTime to leave Facebook\u201d movement. Better to trade away a few minutes per day per user now to keep those users for years to come.  Retraining news readers  When Facebook started, there was no feed. You browsed from profile to profile to check up on friends. News Feed\u2019s launch in 2006 retrained users to just go to the Facebook home page where everything would come to you. Brands followed, investing to build an audience through Facebook\u2019s churning stream of content.  As Facebook\u2019s users shifted from PCs and Macs to Androids and iPhones, the company struck upon an enduring format for mobile. Desktop computers had big enough screens to accomodate multiple windows, and switching between browser tabs was quick, allowing users to easily hop between different sites. But on mobile with tiny screens, low quality app, poor connections, slow-loading sites, people seized upon Facebook\u2019s single app that pulled together content from everywhere. Facebook began to train us to keep scrolling rather than struggle to bounce around.  In 2011, when Facebook first took notice of Twitter, it launched its public figure Subscribe feature and news links gained more visibility in the feed. By 2014, \u201cFacebook the big news machine\u201d was in full swing with Trending, hashtags and news outlets pouring resources into growing their Pages. Emphasizing the \u201cnews\u201d in News Feed retrained users to wait for the big world-changing headlines to come to them rather than crisscrossing the home pages of various publishers. Many don\u2019t even click-through, getting the gist of the news just from the headline and preview blurb. Advertisers followed the eyeballs, moving their spend from the publisher sites to Facebook.  In 2015, Facebook realized users hated waiting for slow mobile websites to load, so it launched Instant Articles to host publisher content within its own app. Instant Articles trained users not to even visit news sites when they clicked their links, instead only having the patience for a fast-loading native page stripped of the publisher\u2019s identity and many of their recirculation and monetization opportunities. Advertisers followed, as publishers allowed Facebook to sell the ads on Instant Articles for them and thereby surrendered their advertiser relationships at the same time as their reader relationships.  This is how Facebook turns publishers into ghostwriters, a problem I blew the whistle on in 2015. Publishers are pitted against each other as they make interchangeable \u201cdumb content\u201d for Facebook\u2019s \u201csmart pipes.\u201d  Publishers wisely began pushing back, demanding more layout and monetization flexibility, and many abandoned the platform in favor of Google\u2019s less prescriptive AMP platform for fast-loading mobile pages. In fact, 38 of 72 Instant Articles launch partner publications including the New York Times and Washington Post have ditched the Facebook controlled format according to a study by Columbia Journalism Review.  Still, publishers have few major sources of traffic outside of Facebook and Google Search. With the death of Google Reader and Twitter\u2019s move to an algorithmic feed, there\u2019s still no at-scale, unfiltered place to share or follow news. If people do want a more direct relationship with news, they should get on Feedly or another RSS readers, or add a few favorite sites to their browser\u2019s bookmark bar.  Meanwhile, Facebook\u2019s only goal remains to provide value to users, and when it comes to content, it doesn\u2019t really care which publisher provides it as long as it\u2019s high-quality.  Siphoning resources to the center  Again and again, Facebook has centralized attention typically spread across the web. A few years back I wrote about \u201c20 New Ways Facebook Is Eating The Internet,\u201d and its appetite has only grown. It\u2019s trying to do the same with Watch (YouTube), Marketplace (Craigslist and eBay) and many other features. It\u2019s a smart plan that ends up arguably improving the experience for individual users \u2014 or at least offering new options while making Facebook more essential and much richer.  The problem is that for society as a whole, this leads to a demonetization and eventual defunding of some news publishers, content creators and utility providers while simultaneously making them heavily reliant on Facebook. This gives Facebook the power to decide what types of content, what topics, and what sources are important. Even if Facebook believes itself to be a neutral tech platform, it implicitly plays the role of media company as its values define the feed. Having a single editor\u2019s fallible algorithms determine the news consumption of the wired world is a precarious situation.  The business side is just as troubling. As Ben Thompson of Stratechery has described, advertisers are abandoning news sites and aggregating to Facebook where they can more efficiently target their exact customers, where they go every day. Why advertise on an intermediary news site when businesses can go straight to well of attention. Without the massive scale and adtech, individual publishers can\u2019t compete for dollars.  But if they resist working with Facebook and providing their content there, another publisher will happily bring the same stories to the social network in return for the short-term traffic boost. There\u2019s always someone else willing to offer up dumb content to the smart pipe.  Steamrolled by strategy change  And the real problem only manifests when Facebook shifts directions. Its comes to the conclusion that users want to see more video, so the format gets more visibility in the News Feed. Soon, publishers scramble to pivot to video, hiring teams and buying expensive equipment so they can blast the content on Facebook rather than thinking about their loyal site visitors. But then Facebook decides too much passive video is bad for you or isn\u2019t interesting, so its News Feed visibility is curtailed, and publishers have wasted their resources and time chasing a white rabbit\u2026 or, in this case, a blue one.  This happened to Page tab apps like musician profile provider BandPage, which was the No. 2 app on Facebook until Facebook banned default landing tabs. The startup lost 90 percent of its traffic after wasting years chasing Facebook\u2019s changes, and eventually sold for $8 million after raising $27 million. Open Graph news reader apps met the same fate, built by publishers to meet the opportunity of Facebook\u2019s short-lived Ticker and \u201cJosh read [clickbait article] on Washington Post Social Reader\u201d stories.  Publishers are currently caught amidst of another massive Facebook strategy change. It\u2019s now striving to offset Russian election interference, fake news for profit, allegations of political bias, polarized society, the explosion of viral video, the absence of friends, and fears that too much scrolling hurts our well-being. That\u2019s led to Facebook proclaiming it will remove 20% of news from the News Feed as it prioritizes content that\u2019s not just meaningful, but stimulates meaningful interactions between users.  On this week\u2019s Q4 2017 earnings call, Zuckerberg said Facebook had already tweaked its algorithm to show fewer viral videos and optimize well-being. The result was a 50 million hours per day reduction in Facebook use, which translates to 2.14 minutes per daily user, or 5 percent of total time spent on Facebook. The company was willing to go so far as to make changes that led to its slowest ever user growth rate, and its first decline in total users anywhere as the U.S. & Canada region actually lost 700,000 Facebookers.  Yet it\u2019s the video makers and news publishers who will pay for this pivot of purpose. Facebook\u2019s revenue still reached a record $12.97 billion, and investors still boosted its share price higher. In fact, Facebook could actually earn money or at least break even from the \u201cTime Well Spent\u201d changes.  By decreasing total time spent but raising the quality of content people see, Facebook ends up with fewer total ad impressions but higher engagement rates as people are retrained to skip less of what they see. Advertisers still eager to reach its massive audience will compete in Facebook\u2019s ad auctions, paying higher prices. Facebook has the cash reserves and momentum to weather the short-term monetization drop in exchange for a healthier long-term future. Content creators are left trying to make ends meet.  [Update 2/4/2018: Zuckerberg discussed Facebook\u2019s ability to persevere despite mistakes in his post about the company\u2019s 14th birthday. \u201cOver the years I\u2019ve made almost every mistake you can imagine . . . I\u2019ve missed important trends and I\u2019ve been slow to others. I\u2019ve launched product after product that failed. The reason our community exists today is not because we avoid mistakes. It\u2019s because we believe what we\u2019re doing matters enough to keep trying\u201d. The issue is that other less secure and successful businesses like newsrooms don\u2019t have the resources to undertake trial and error at the scale necessary to keep up with Facebook\u2019s changes.]  Stay the course  And now local news site are facing the start of this dangerous cycle. Facebook says it will show more local news in the News Feed. It\u2019s testing a \u201cToday in\u201d local news digest in several cities. It\u2019s prioritizing content people discuss instead of passively consume. And Facebook is pushing its new mission to rebuild communities and Bring the World Closer Together that aligns with local news.  Sounds great, right? There\u2019s no doubt there\u2019s an opportunity here for local news outlets. But the key to keeping their boats afloat is not completely changing course to follow Facebook\u2019s siren call. Whether or not you think the company is purposefully trying to destroy the industries it invades or just modernize them to benefit users, publishers must meet Facebook with skepticism.  Facebook\u2019s next retraining appears to be that it\u2019s the best place to get local news, not your local newspaper or blog. It might happily display all the headlines with little encouragement for readers to click through, as it does with Today On. It might make images and videos load faster than they do on local sites. And they might bundle local news with Facebook Events and reviews of nearby places using personalization local sites can\u2019t match.  That might be good for the reader, and thereby for Facebook long term, but it\u2019s dangerous for the publishers. Facebook doesn\u2019t even have to purposefully poach advertisers from local sites, they\u2019ll just flow to it naturally as it becomes the local news destination.  They should still focus on turning occasional readers into repeat homepage visitors that bookmark the site and return frequently. They should track analytics about what kinds of stories those loyalists want, rather than the ones that might drive occasional traffic spikes of fly-by readers. They should invest in developing their own ad technology or partnering with more neutral third-party providers. And they should keep pushing email newsletter, event and subscription signups.  That\u2019s because there\u2019s no telling when Facebook\u2019s strategy around what users want or how to give it to them will change. Again, Facebook wants users to be informed and entertained, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily care how or by whom. And let\u2019s not forget that Facebook is quietly building up its Marketplace peer-to-peer selling feature in another part of its app to be the ultimate replacement for the classified ads that used to keep local news sites afloat.  Unfortunately, big, well-funded publishers staffed with true tech talent haven\u2019t been able to gracefully navigate the constantly changing playing field set by Facebook. So what hope do smaller outlets without the technological or strategic prowess hope to have?  In Zuckerberg\u2019s hometown of Dobbs Ferry, NY, there\u2019s a beloved newspaper called The Rivertowns Enterprise. It\u2019s a destination for those seeking local news, with a loyal following for both its website and its weekly print edition, which many who grew up there get delivered to their homes around the country. Visit its site and you\u2019ll stumble across a variety of stories about city politics, high school sports and Main Street businesses that also advertise there.  But as Facebook turns its eyes toward local news as an answer to larger problems with well-being, false information and polarized communities, it also poses a threat to The Rivertowns Enterprise and outlets like it. The inevitable march of technological progress was merely accelerated by the dominant social network.

For instance, it could have a special emoji Reaction float across the stream as a way to thank the fan who gave money.  The amount Facebook will keep from these tips that it calls \u201cfan support\u201d isn\u2019t clear yet, but the company tells me that it\u2019s safe to assume there will be a revenue share.

Goals of the program include helping gamers of all fame levels grow meaningful and engaged communities of followers across Facebook, Instagram and Oculus, plus providing monetization tools.  Gamers who want to join the program and gain access to tipping on their streams can sign up to apply here. There\u2019s also a big site full of best-practices for gamers who want to grow their audience amidst Facebook\u2019s ever-changing News Feed algorithm.  Facebook hopes to pull game streamers away from YouTube and Twitch where they have ad revenue, tipping and subscription options to monetize. For reference, YouTube takes a 30 percent rake from its Super Chat tipping and Sponsorships subscription payments options, while Twitch also takes 30 percent from its Cheering tipping option.  The push aligns with Facebook\u2019s recent overhaul of its News Feed with a focus on well-being and active interaction over passive media consumption. Game streams often see viewers chiming in about what they want the creator to do next while debating tactics and joking around with fellow viewers. That gives people a better sense of connection than just watching random eye-catching throwaway videos in the feed. It\u2019s the same reason Facebook just inked exclusive deals to stream big esports tournaments, like CS:GO.  If Facebook can lure creators with its 2 billion-plus user audience and virality, plus its new payment system, it could develop a wide array of video content for video game enthusiasts to watch. It\u2019s a highly monetizable demographic that watches a ton of video, so Facebook could use gaming as a way to pull them into its wider content ecosystem.", "stock": "FB"}, {"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/01/23/facebook-confirm-io/", "label": 1, "source": "techcrunch", "date": "2018-01-23", "article": "Facebook has confirmed to TechCrunch that it\u2019s acquired\u2026 Confirm.io. The startup offered an API that let other companies quickly verify someone\u2019s government-issued identification card, like a driver\u2019s license, was authentic. The Boston-based startup will shut down as both its team and technology are rolled into Facebook, where it could help users who are locked out of their accounts.  Confirm.io had raised at least $4 million from investors, including Cava Capital, since launching three years ago. The 2015 seed round funded advanced forensics used to pull information from an ID card, as well as mobile biometrics and facial recognition to confirm a person\u2019s identity before the startup deleted the personal data.  Clients could quickly integrate the tech, which expedited on-demand startup staff onboarding. Food delivery service Doordash used Confirm.io to verify its drivers, while Notarize used it to authenticate the identity of customers looking to file documents.  The startup writes, \u201cWhen we launched Confirm, our mission was to become the market\u2019s trusted identity origination platform for which other multifactor verification services can build upon. Now, we\u2019re ready to take the next step on our journey with Facebook.

Their technology and expertise will support our ongoing efforts to keep our community safe.\u201d  Facebook could potentially use the technology to have people confirm their identities if they\u2019re locked out of their accounts after being hacked or losing their password. Back in September we spotted Facebook testing a feature that let you unlock your account using a selfie. And since at least 2013, Facebook has let people mail in a copy of their photo ID or other identity verification materials in order to regain access to their account.  Because this is a full acquisition, not just an acqui-hire, Confirm.io\u2019s team and tech could help Facebook strengthen and streamline these options. And one day, perhaps Facebook could even serve as your ID card in some situations. Face ID on the iPhone X could eventually be opened to third parties to power more biometric security across apps.

Everyone seems to easily theorize what they might do in a world with AR glasses, but it\u2019s the current world where a lot of companies are having a tough time visualizing what will make a user raise their smartphone up to see an augmented view of the world.  Google\u2019s ARCore platform has been a wide open world for developers to find out what to do with positional tracking on horizontal planes (on select devices). Meanwhile, Facebook\u2019s Camera Effects has been a more straightforward entrance into the world of selfie filters, but lives inside Facebook Camera, which you may be surprised to learn exists in your FB app.  Long story short, it\u2019s early days, so getting the right talent to define your product vision is obviously key. Facebook has the long game of AR being mapped out on the hardware side with Oculus Research eyeing wild displays, but getting more people focused on the use cases of tomorrow \u2014 even if they just look like updated camera features rather than dedicated quote-unquote AR features \u2014 is a different challenge altogether.", "stock": "FB"}, {"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/03/27/mozillas-new-extension-keeps-your-facebook-data-isolated-to-the-social-network-itself/", "label": 1, "source": "techcrunch", "date": "2018-03-27", "article": "Mozilla this morning launched a Firefox browser add-on for those users not willing to delete their Facebook account, but also wanting some control over how much of their data Facebook can access. The \u201cFacebook Container,\u201d as the new extension is called, isolates your Facebook identity from the rest of the web. That means Facebook will not be able to use your other web activity to send your targeted advertising.  To be clear, this extension wouldn\u2019t have saved users\u2019 data from being compromised as it was in the Cambridge Analytica scandal; and it does nothing to prevent Facebook advertisers from diving into your profile and your activity while on the social network in order to target you with advertisements while browsing Facebook.  However, it is meant to plug at least one of the holes in Facebook\u2019s leaky dam by offering a way for users to prevent Facebook from gaining even more data collected outside its service.  \u201cContainers are a feature built into the Firefox platform that separate user cookies and site data into different cookie jars,\u201d explains Jeff Griffiths, Product Lead for Firefox. \u201cFor Facebook Container specifically, this means that a user should only be able to log in in the Facebook Container. Facebook cookies and site data that identify the user are only available to that Container, and only Facebook can be open in that Container,\u201d he says.  When you install the new extension, it deletes your Facebook cookies and logs you out of the social network. The next time you open Facebook, you\u2019ll notice it\u2019s been opened in a blue-colored \u201ccontainer\u201d tab.  From within that tab, you can continue to use Facebook normally. However, if you click a link that would take you to a page off of Facebook, it will load the URL outside the container. Similarly, if you click any Facebook Share buttons outside of Facebook, it will load those in the Facebook container. (But this will send information to Facebook about the website you shared them from, it should be noted.)  In addition, you may not be able to login to third-party apps with your Facebook credentials, and the embedded Facebook comments and Like buttons you see around the web won\u2019t work either.  \u201cThis prevents Facebook from associating information about your activity on websites outside of Facebook to your Facebook identity,\u201d explains The Firefox Frontier blog. \u201cSo it may look different than what you are used to seeing.\u201d  Actually, it may surprise you to find out how widespread your use of Facebook was when outside the social network.  Facebook\u2019s platform and its off-site advertising network allow other sites and apps to access users\u2019 Facebook data even when users aren\u2019t on Facebook itself. Facebook is hardly alone in terms of companies doing this. But it is making headlines over data mishandling, which means it\u2019s a good time for Mozilla to capitalize on consumers\u2019 concerns to share their messages \u2013 and tools \u2013 focused on data privacy.  Mozilla said it sped up its work on the Facebook Container add-on, which is based on technology it\u2019s been developing over the past couple of years, as it\u2019s seen increasing consumer demand for tools for managing privacy and security.  There are other tools available to help consumers with these issues today, as well, including the Ghostery anti-tracking extension now owned by Cliqz, ad blockers (including those bundled with browsers like Safari), and more.  However, single-purpose tools like this are useful because they allow people to limit some data-sharing activity, without having to take the drastic step of deleting Facebook.

Abandon your transparently greedy get-rich-quick schemes, turn away from your casinos of de-facto modern-day penny stocks, and focus your decentralized attention on what the world needs. Save us, O blockchainers, from the scourge that is Facebook! Decentralize all the things!  I\u2019m kidding, of course. For now.  Every year, it seems, a new \u201cnew Facebook\u201d arises, swells, deflates, and vanishes, generally in a matter of weeks. Remember Diaspora? Ello? Mastodon? Vero? I imagine them as gangs of bandits charging The Wall in Game of Thrones, prompting the Night\u2019s Watch of Menlo Park to \u2026 ignore them completely until they go away. The critical mass of everyone you know, plus the cost and complexity of an infrastructure that provides a broad panoply of valuable features to two billion people \u2014 those are Facebook\u2019s 700-foot-high barrier of enchanted ice.  And yet. It is whispered in dark corners, at conventions with names like Consensus and TokenFest, that there is a secret tunnel in that wall, a fundamental flaw. That Facebook\u2019s advantage of massive scale could melt away if faced by the dark magic of decentralization, wherein users own their own data, encrypted by them, stored in the location of their choice, shared only as and when they explicitly approve, while they connect peer-to-peer with interactions mediated and paid for via a tokenized protocol, across an armada of nodes running \u2014 yep, you guessed it \u2014 some sort of blockchain.  This is essentially nonsense. For now. Its fundamental flaw is the fundamental flaw of most grandiose decentralized blockchain notions; they are too much, too large, too megalomaniacal, too soon. They want to supplant the entire existing order, whether it be money, the entire financial sector, democratic governance, social media \u2026 or, really, pick a field of human endeavour, there\u2019s probably some white paper outlining a token-based decentralized wholesale replacement for the way things are done now.  Dear blockchain people: stop it. I like big thinking as much as anyone, but in practice you don\u2019t change things by overthrowing them. You won\u2019t blow out a torch that\u2019s been burning for many years with your new Big Bang. Instead, in practice, you start small, with a tiny cohort of enthusiasts, and you iterate \u2014 sometimes for a very long time \u2014 before you get any traction that the wider world notices at all. You do not, repeat not, gather a band of adventurers together in an inn to immediately form up and charge The Wall.  Especially stop it with consumer applications. I stand by my statement that \u201cblockchains are the new Linux, not the new Internet\u201d more strongly with each passing month. Blockchain enthusiasts may enjoy perusing their wallets and counting how many different kinds of ERC20 tokens \u2014 which generally still have no actual utility, beyond that of a penny stock \u2014 are contained within. Ordinary users, however, do not.  Better token UX won\u2019t fix their fundamental problem. Online micropayments didn\u2019t fail again and again because decentralized tokens weren\u2019t a thing yet; they failed because their cognitive load was far too great to sustain their use. Tokens don\u2019t change that one iota. If your consumer decentralized app involves ordinary users knowingly accumulating, spending, or transferring custom tokens, your consumer decentralized app will fail.  But, you know what? Having said all that? I wasn\u2019t kidding with the first line of this post. Dear blockchain people, this is your hour, if you would only recognize it. But your objective is not to compete with, or replace, centralized services. That may never be the objective, and that\u2019s OK. Rather, your goal right now is to create a viable alternative for those who reject existing centralized services, whether they be many or few.  That\u2019s what Bitcoin itself is, after all; a weird little alternative to centralized finance. Over the course of a decade it has, beyond astonishingly, actually become viable, useful, self-sufficient, and globally successful, but it remains a weird little alternative, and will for the foreseeable future.  In its wake we now have the tools to create decentralized apps that aren\u2019t just about value transfer. Consider Blockstack, which includes \u201ca decentralized micro-blogging app\u201d among its basic tutorials. Consider Cosmos, designed to allow blockchains to interoperate with one another, forming a decentralized web of chains they call \u201cthe Internet of blockchains.\u201d And of course consider Ethereum, which, believe it or not, isn\u2019t just for ICOs, but lets you run arbitrary decentralized code, and, importantly, has serious plans to massively scale its throughput.  We\u2019re approaching \u2014 or maybe already at \u2014 the point at which these tools could be put together to construct, say, a small-scale decentralized social network. It would still face the critical-mass problem: but that could be addressed by focusing on specific cohorts and communities; art collectives, churches, fandoms, etcetera. It would still face the ordinary-people-don\u2019t-want-tokens problem: but that could be addressed by having a designated token-handling admin for each node, in the same way that online communities used to have designated email admins or local Usenet sysadmins, so ordinary users would just need a URL, a userid/password, and perhaps a decision whether to pay for access or be advertised to.  Is this vague and handwavey? You betcha. But I\u2019ve done a fair amount of decentralized systems coding myself, of late, and I can tell you that the tools and networks are \u2014 well. They\u2019re getting there. They\u2019re close. And once you\u2019ve built a local social network wherein users control their data, one which is part of a higher-order decentralized network of nodes, all communicating via a common tokenized protocol \u2026 well, then you have a whole world of new, interesting, and daunting scaling problems.  But my point is that you don\u2019t have to scale to the size of Facebook for an alternative to be viable. Think small. The Wall isn\u2019t going anywhere, but maybe you don\u2019t need to traverse it after all. The world will have Facebook for a long time to come, but Facebook doesn\u2019t have to be part of your world \u2026 especially if a weird, clunky, charmingly ramshackle little alternative exists, one from which you ultimately find you get far more net emotional and practical value. If things keep going as they are, maybe you won\u2019t ever have to go through the Wall to get to the people on the other side. Maybe, eventually, they\u2019ll come to you.", "stock": "FB"}, {"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/02/12/facebook-starts-pushing-its-data-tracking-onavo-vpn-within-its-main-mobile-app/", "label": 1, "source": "techcrunch", "date": "2018-02-12", "article": "Onavo Protect, the VPN client from the data-security app maker acquired by Facebook back in 2013, has now popped up in the Facebook iOS app itself, under the banner \u201cProtect\u201d in the navigation menu.

It\u2019s unclear what percentage of Facebook\u2019s iOS user base is seeing the option, or which markets may have had this listing before, as there\u2019s been little reporting on the feature.* [See Facebook comment below. The company now confirms this is available to iOS users in the U.S.]  We do know this is not the first time Onavo\u2019s Protect has shown up in Facebook\u2019s app \u2013 it was spotted before in 2016 in the UK. The company also tells us it\u2019s been available in the Android app since around the same time.  Marketing Onavo within Facebook itself could lead to a boost in users for the VPN app, which promises to warn users of malicious websites and keep information secure \u2013 like bank account and credit card numbers \u2013 as you browse. But Facebook didn\u2019t buy Onavo for its security protections.  Instead, Onavo\u2019s VPN allow Facebook to monitor user activity across apps, giving Facebook a big advantage in terms of spotting new trends across the larger mobile ecosystem. For example, Facebook gets an early heads up about apps that are becoming breakout hits; it can tell which are seeing slowing user growth; it sees which apps\u2019 new features appear to be resonating with their users, and much more.  This data has already helped Facebook in a number of ways, most notably in its battle with Snapchat. At The WSJ reported last August, Facebook could tell that Instagram\u2019s launch of Stories \u2013 a Snapchat-like feature \u2013 was working to slow Snapchat\u2019s user growth, before the company itself even publicly disclosed this fact.  This past fall, Facebook snatched up the teen compliment app tbh, and quickly integrated a similar Q&A feature into its social network soon after. This all took place before Tbh had truly established itself as a new social network. It wasn\u2019t clear at the time if it was the next big thing, or just a flash in the pan. (It appears to have been the latter.) Onavo\u2019s insights into Tbh\u2019s fast rise and heavy engagement likely gave Facebook a heads-up.  The Onavo app today has more than 33 million installs across the iOS App Store and Google Play, according to data from Sensor Tower. Around 62 percent of those from Google Play \u2013 which could be another reason why Facebook is giving Onavo a push on iOS. The U.S. is currently the app\u2019s largest user base, followed by India and Brazil.  Onavo\u2019s app store description explains that it\u2019s \u201ca part of Facebook,\u201d and that it\u2019s used to \u201cimprove Facebook products and services, gain insights into the products and service people value, and build better experiences.\u201d  However, it\u2019s not likely that all Onavo users understand they\u2019re actually feeding Facebook the information that allows it to take on any challenger to its social networking empire. (That empire also includes WhatsApp and Instagram as well as smaller acquisitions like tbh and MSQRD).  This would not be the first time Facebook has integrated one of its other mobile apps into Facebook itself. The company earlier made it easier to launch Instagram through a new Facebook feature, and it has tested and rolled out various WhatsApp integrations, too.  Facebook hasn\u2019t yet offered a comment on the new addition of Onavo to its main app, but we\u2019ll update this post if one is provided.  * Update, 2/13/18, 9:30 PM ET: Facebook has now provided a comment, confirming the iOS addition is new.  \u201cWe recently began letting people in the U.S. access Onavo Protect from the Facebook app on their iOS devices,\u201d Erez Naveh, Product Manager at Onavo told TechCrunch via email. \u201cLike other VPNs, it acts as a secure connection to protect people from potentially harmful sites.

So despite criticism and a slow start for traction, Facebook is doubling down on Stories by testing the ability to create them from desktop, and a much more prominent placement for viewing Stories atop the News Feed instead of in the sidebar.  \u201cWe are always working to ensure people can easily navigate and enjoy Facebook, regardless of how they connect,\u201d a Facebook spokesperson tells me. \u201cWe are testing the option to create and share Stories from Facebook on desktop and are also testing moving the Stories tray from the top right corner to above News Feed, just like on mobile.\u201d Previously you could only consume Stories on web that had to be created on mobile. For now, a small percentage of users will see this new posting ability and design.  All aboard the Stories train  Brands, Event promoters, and Group admins who manage their Facebook presence from desktop might embrace Stories more now that they can post from there, too. Collaborative Stories, where Group members and Event attendees can all contribute, are one of the most exciting opportunities for Facebook Stories.  But the company has to be careful that brands don\u2019t drown out friends\u2019 Stories, but that\u2019s one of the advantages of algorithmically filtering the slideshows that disappear in 24 hours. Expect Facebook not to make the same mistake it made allowing professional publishers to overwhelm the News Feed, which it\u2019s now walking back in a massive change to its content ranking strategy.  Advertisers might also be more comfortable getting aboard Stories thanks to desktop access. Digiday reports Facebook is building an augmented reality team in London to help it pitch sponsored AR filters to advertisers, similar to how Snapchat monetizes beyond injecting traditional display ads between Stories as Facebook does on Instagram.  Facebook users will be able to upload photos or videos, or shoot them with their webcam to post from desktop. That could attract the monologue-style YouTube vloggers who have trained themselves to talk into their computer.  By showing Stories above the News Feed instead of to the side, Facebook clearly thinks the content deserves more attention, and is even willing to push down its status update composer and News Feed posts to make room. That\u2019s a bold shift, considering Facebook hesitated until August to show Stories on desktop after their January launch and March rollout on mobile.  Stories are critical to Facebook\u2019s AR future  CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said that while eyeglass computers might be the future of augmented reality, Facebook won\u2019t wait for it, and the smartphone is already a capable AR device. But for Facebook to have a functioning AR strategy \u2014 whether for keeping people coming back to play with AR face masks, watch friends jazz up their lives or giving advertisers creative tools \u2014 it has to get people watching Stories en masse.  That\u2019s why it started syncing Facebook Stories across Facebook and Messenger so posts on one show up in both. It\u2019s why it\u2019s allowing people to syndicate their Instagram Stories to Facebook Stories. It\u2019s why it\u2019s recruiting an army of outside developers to build AR tools for Story-tellers. And it\u2019s why Facebook\u2019s desktop site is now fully adopting Stories.  Whether users warm up to them is another question. Facebook\u2019s social graph has bloated to include distant acquaintances and family you might not want to be able to see a raw view into your day-to-day adventures. That\u2019s the advantage of Snapchat\u2019s closer-friends network, and something Facebook may need a better privacy solution for to get people to share.  But remember that people protested the News Feed when it first arrived on Facebook. And the younger generation that\u2019s addicted to Snapchat shows how users can pour a half hour a day into sending, posting and watching camera-based content. If that\u2019s any portent, Facebook might just be early to delivering mainstream users the shift from text to Stories. And if you give people a prominent space to show off for friends, vanity and narcissism may eventually compel them to fill that space with snippets of their lives.", "stock": "FB"}, {"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/01/31/facebook-q4-2017-earnings/", "label": 1, "source": "techcrunch", "date": "2018-01-31", "article": "Despite worries about Russia and that passive News Feed scrolling hurts us, Facebook beat expectations again in its Q4 2017 earnings report.

That\u2019s a sizeable slow down, and the lowest quarter-over-quarter percentage daily user growth ever reported by the company.  That could be because CEO Mark Zuckerberg says Facebook made changes including showing fewer viral videos \u201cthat reduced time spent on Facebook by roughly 50 million hours every day.\u201d That equates to 2.14 minutes per daily user per day, or 5% of total time spent on Facebook. The viral video changes triggered Facebook\u2019s first-ever decline in daily active users in the US & Canada region, which saw a 700,000 user decline.  Facebook reached $12.97 billion in revenue with $2.21 adjusted GAAP earnings per share if you don\u2019t count a massive tax it had to pay on overseas cash that translated into a $0.77 reduction in EPS. Without that tax, it beat Wall Street\u2019s estimates of $12.55 billion in revenue and $1.95 EPS, but with it reported $1.44 EPS.  Facebook\u2019s monthly user count is now at 2.13 billion, up 3.39% from 2.06 billion in Q3 compared to 3.19% growth that quarter, so the monthly user growth sped up even as daily user growth slowed.

That shows people are still avidly returning to the site even if they spend less time there.  Average revenue per user climbed to $6.18, up 27% from a year ago. Average revenue was up 47% year-over-year, even though Facebook has been warning investors that it\u2019s running out of space in the News Feed to put ads. Facebook raked in a record $4.26 billion in profit, down from $4.7 billion the previous quarter due to that big tax. Facebook\u2019s share price was down at first down a steep 4% in after-hours trading, but now is up over 3%.  [Updates from the earnings call: Facebook announced that WhatsApp now has 1.5 billion monthly users, up from 1.3 billion in July. It announced a 700,000 daily user decline in the US & Canada due to reducing viral video visibility. Zuckerberg said he\u2019s directed his company to priortize not the most meaningful content, but the content that drives the most meaningful interaction. Facebook\u2019s research suggests total Story posting across apps will overtake feed posting.]  Overall, the results show how divorced Facebook\u2019s user behavior is from the day-to-day news coverage blasting it for allowing Russian interference in US elections and for making us unhealthy zombie browsers. ComScore and Nielsen claim time spent on Facebook per U.S. user is declining, and that showed up in the daily user count growth. And Facebook purposefully made changes leading to its first ever decline of daily users in the US. But Facebook seems to be making up for that in international monthly user growth and squeezing more dollars out of each ad.  With the Snapchat threat largely neutralized via Instagram, Facebook\u2019s biggest enemy is itself. Now it has to work to preemptively disarm any future privacy crises or other scandals, and co-opt the \u201cTime Well Spent\u201d rallying call before it becomes a \u201cTime to leave Facebook\u201d movement.", "stock": "FB"}, {"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/04/05/zuckerberg-deleted-messages/", "label": 0, "source": "techcrunch", "date": "2018-04-06", "article": "Facebook retracted Zuckerberg\u2019s messages from recipients\u2019 inboxes Facebook says it was for security, but is it a breach of user trust?  You can\u2019t remove Facebook messages from the inboxes of people you sent them to, but Facebook did that for Mark Zuckerberg and other executives. Three sources confirm to TechCrunch that old Facebook messages they received from Zuckerberg have disappeared from their Facebook inboxes, while their own replies to him conspicuously remain. An email receipt of a Facebook message from 2010 reviewed by TechCrunch proves Zuckerberg sent people messages that no longer appear in their Facebook chat logs or in the files available from Facebook\u2019s Download Your Information tool.  When asked by TechCrunch about the situation, Facebook claimed in this statement it was done for corporate security:  \u201cAfter Sony Pictures\u2019 emails were hacked in 2014 we made a number of changes to protect our executives\u2019 communications. These included limiting the retention period for Mark\u2019s messages in Messenger. We did so in full compliance with our legal obligations to preserve messages.\u201d  However, Facebook never publicly disclosed the removal of messages from users\u2019 inboxes, nor privately informed the recipients. That raises the question of whether this was a breach of user trust. When asked that question directly over Messenger, Zuckerberg declined to provide a statement.  Tampering with users\u2019 inboxes  A Facebook spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch that users can only delete messages from their own inboxes, and that they would still show up in the recipient\u2019s thread. There appears to be no \u201cretention period\u201d for normal users\u2019 messages, as my inbox shows messages from as early as 2005. That indicates Zuckerberg and other executives received special treatment in being able to pull back previously sent messages.  [Update 4/6/2018: Facebook now says that it plans to launch an \u201cunsend\u201d feature for Facebook messages to all users in the next several months, and won\u2019t let Mark Zuckerberg use that feature any more until it launches for everyone. One option Facebook is considering for the Unsend feature is an expiration timer users could set. But it\u2019s alarming that Facebook didn\u2019t disclose the retractions or plans for a Unsend button until forced, and scrambling to give everyone the feature seems like an effort to quiet users\u2019 anger over the situation.]  Facebook chats sent by Zuckerberg from several years ago or older were missing from the inboxes of both former employees and non-employees. What\u2019s left makes it look like the recipients were talking to themselves, as only their side of back-and-forth conversations with Zuckerberg still appear. Three sources asked to remain anonymous out of fear of angering Zuckerberg or burning bridges with the company.  [Update: Recent messages from Zuckerberg remain in users\u2019 inboxes. Old messages from before 2014 still appear to some users, indicating the retraction did not apply to all chats the CEO sent. But more sources have come forward since publication, saying theirs disappeared, as well.]  None of Facebook\u2019s terms of service appear to give it the right to remove content from users\u2019 accounts unless it violates the company\u2019s community standards. While it\u2019s somewhat standard for corporations to have data retention policies that see them delete emails or other messages from their own accounts that were sent by employees, they typically can\u2019t remove the messages from the accounts of recipients outside the company. It\u2019s rare that these companies own the communication channel itself and therefore host both sides of messages as Facebook does in this case, which potentially warrants a different course of action with more transparency than quietly retracting the messages.  Facebook\u2019s power to tamper with users\u2019 private message threads could alarm some. The issue is amplified by the fact that Facebook Messenger now has 1.3 billion users, making it one of the most popular communication utilities in the world.  Zuckerberg is known to have a team that helps him run his Facebook profile, with some special abilities for managing his 105 million followers and constant requests for his attention. For example, Zuckerberg\u2019s profile doesn\u2019t show a button to add him as a friend on desktop, and the button is grayed out and disabled on mobile. But the ability to change the messaging inboxes of other users is far more concerning.  Facebook may have sought to prevent leaks of sensitive corporate communications. Following the Sony hack, emails of Sony\u2019s president Michael Lynton, who sat on Snap Inc.\u2019s board, were exposed, revealing secret acquisitions and strategy.  However, Facebook also may have looked to thwart the publication of potentially embarrassing personal messages sent by Zuckerberg or other executives. In 2010, Silicon Alley Insider aka Business Insider published now-infamous instant messages from a 19-year-old Zuckerberg to a friend shortly after starting The Facebook in 2004. \u201cyea so if you ever need info about anyone at harvard . . . just ask . . . i have over 4000 emails, pictures, addresses, sns\u201d Zuckerberg wrote to a friend. \u201cwhat!? how\u2019d you manage that one?\u201d they asked. \u201cpeople just submitted it . . i don\u2019t know why . . . they \u2018trust me\u2019 . . . dumb fucks\u201d Zuckerberg explained.  The New Yorker later confirmed the messages with Zuckerberg, who told the publication he \u201cabsolutely\u201d regretted them. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to go on to build a service that is influential and that a lot of people rely on, then you need to be mature, right? I think I\u2019ve grown and learned a lot,\u201d said Zuckerberg.  If the goal of Facebook\u2019s security team was to keep a hacker from accessing the accounts of executives and therefore all of their messages, they could have merely been deleted on their side the way any Facebook user is free to do, without them disappearing from the various recipients\u2019 inboxes. If Facebook believed it needed to remove the messages entirely from its servers in case the company\u2019s backend systems we breached, a disclosure of some kind seems reasonable.  Now as Facebook encounters increased scrutiny regarding how it treats users\u2019 data in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, the retractions could become a bigger issue. Zuckerberg is slated to speak in front of the U.S. Senate Judiciary and Commerce committees on April 10, as well as the House Energy and Commerce Committee on April 11. They could request more information about Facebook removing messages or other data from users\u2019 accounts without their consent. While Facebook is trying to convey that it understands its responsibilities, the black mark left on public opinion by past behavior may prove permanent.

Facebook is also now preemptively blocking the creation of millions of fake accounts per day. Facebook revealed this news on a conference call with journalists [Update: and later a blog post] about its efforts around election integrity that included Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos, who\u2019s reportedly leaving Facebook later this year but claims he\u2019s still committed to the company.  Stamos outlined how Facebook is building ways to address fake identities, fake audiences grown illicitly or pumped up to make content appear more popular, acts of spreading false information and false narratives that are intentionally deceptive and shape people\u2019s views beyond the facts. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to develop a systematic and comprehensive approach to tackle these challenges, and then to map that approach to the needs of each country or election,\u201d says Stamos.  Samidh Chakrabarti, Facebook\u2019s product manager for civic engagement, also explained that Facebook is now proactively looking for foreign-based Pages producing civic-related content inauthentically. It removes them from the platform if a manual review by the security team finds they violate terms of service.  \u201cThis proactive approach has allowed us to move more quickly and has become a really important way for us to prevent divisive or misleading memes from going viral,\u201d said Chakrabarti. Facebook first piloted this tool in the Alabama special election where the proactive system identified and shut down a ring of Macedonian spammers meddling with the election to earn money, but has now deployed it to protect Italian elections and will use it for the U.S. mid-term elections.  Meanwhile, advances in machine learning have allowed Facebook \u201cto find more suspicious behaviors without assessing the content itself\u201d to block millions of fake account creations per day \u201cbefore they can do any harm,\u201d says Chakrabarti. [Update 2:15pm PST: Facebook is expected to share more about these tools during its \u201cFighting Abuse @Scale\u201d conference in SF on April 25th.]  Facebook implemented its first slew of election protections back in December 2016, including working with third-party fact checkers to flag articles as false. But those red flags were shown to entrench some people\u2019s belief in false stories, leading Facebook to shift to showing Related Articles with perspectives from other reputable news outlets. As of yesterday, Facebook\u2019s fact checking partners began reviewing suspicious photos and videos which can also spread false information. This could reduce the spread of false news image memes that live on Facebook and require no extra clicks to view, like doctored photos showing the Parkland school shooting survivor Emma Gonz\u00e1lez ripping up the constitution.  Normally, Facebook sends fact checkers stories that are being flagged by users and going viral. But now in countries like Italy and Mexico, in anticipation of elections, Facebook has enabled fact checkers to proactively flag things because in some cases they can identify false stories that are spreading before Facebook\u2019s own systems. \u201cTo reduce latency in advance of elections, we wanted to ensure we gave fact checkers that ability,\u201d says Facebook\u2019s News Feed product manager Tessa Lyons.  With the mid-terms coming up quick, Facebook has to both secure its systems against election interference, as well as convince users and regulators that it\u2019s made real progress since the 2016 presidential election, where Russian meddlers ran rampant.

The changes have left investors wondering whether people will still spend as much time on the site and whether brands will continue placing as many digital ads there.  On Wednesday, Facebook sought to soothe Wall Street\u2019s worries over those questions. No, people will not spend as much time on the site, the company said as it reported quarterly financial results. But don\u2019t worry, Facebook added, because the changes will ultimately benefit its business.  With the adjustments to what it shows on its site, \u201cI believe that the time spent on Facebook will be more valuable,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said in a conference call with analysts. \u201cIf people interact more, it should lead to stronger community. When you care about something, you\u2019re willing to see ads to experience it.\u201d  The scrutiny followed changes that Facebook announced in January to its News Feed, the scrolling screen of content that the social network\u2019s more than two billion members see when they log in to the site. After months of criticism over the harmful effects of the social network, Mr. Zuckerberg said Facebook wanted to emphasize more \u201cmeaningful\u201d content, such as photos and posts that friends and family have interacted with, and would play down articles from publishers.

The shift to more meaningful content has just started rolling out, but the company made other changes last year as a precursor to the latest moves, including cutting down on viral videos.

The filing seeks records of those transactions from Facebook, and it urges the company to assess whether Mr. Hun Sen and his allies have been violating the platform\u2019s terms of use.  Photo  Genevieve Grdina, a spokeswoman for Facebook, declined to comment directly on the petition, but she said that anyone with a public Facebook page could purchase targeted ads to reach particular audiences, and that Facebook made every possible effort to identify and eliminate click farms and fake pages.  Mr. Hun Sen, who has been in power for 33 years, has overseen an extensive crackdown on dissent and opposition as national elections scheduled for July have approached. The country\u2019s main opposition party has been dissolved, its leaders \u2014 including Mr. Sam Rainsy, who lives abroad \u2014 have been driven into exile or jailed, and independent news media outlets have been shut down.  Mr. Hun Sen nearly lost Cambodia\u2019s last national elections, in 2013, to the party led by Mr. Sam Rainsy, which used Facebook to appeal to young people and to skirt government restrictions on his access to traditional media. The opposition recruited a team to report and broadcast news shows entirely on Facebook, and used young social media stars to encourage attendance at antigovernment protests. (The opposition and its supporters also used the site to spread false rumors, as well as racist claims about Vietnamese living in Cambodia.)  Mr. Hun Sen seemed to learn his lesson. The premier and his family assembled a team to disseminate pro-government propaganda and pour money into promoting their own pages on Facebook, which is one of the country\u2019s most popular sources of information. Government ministries, all of which are run by Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s party, were ordered to form \u201cFacebook working groups,\u201d and officials were told to start their own personal pages to interact with the public.  However his \u201clikes\u201d were generated, Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s Facebook page now has more of them than any other in Cambodia. On it, he intersperses policy dictates and slick propaganda videos with slices of everyday life: photographs of him in an undershirt on the beach, in bed with his wife, and hugging garment factory workers. In speeches posted to his page, he rails against his political opponents and threatens that war will ensue if he ever loses power, while also offering folksy musings and updates on his health.  Duong Dara, who manages Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s Facebook presence, said Mr. Sam Rainsy\u2019s petition revealed a misunderstanding of the nature of advertising.

Mr. Sam Rainsy has been living overseas since 2015, after being bombarded with a spate of lawsuits that would see him jailed for years if he were to return. In one of his many legal cases, he was convicted of defamation after complaining that the prime minister appeared to be purchasing Facebook \u201clikes\u201d from India and the Philippines.

The Cambodian government has also clamped down on ordinary Facebook users, monitoring the site for dissent and sometimes prosecuting people. One woman fled the country after being sought by the police for throwing a shoe at a sign advertising the Cambodian People\u2019s Party and uploading a video of the act to Facebook. On Thursday, Thailand sent her back to Cambodia, where she was taken into police custody.  In another case, a student was jailed for 18 months for calling for a \u201ccolor revolution\u201d on Facebook. No pro-government Facebook users have ever been prosecuted along similar lines.  Huy Vannak, an under secretary of state at Cambodia\u2019s Interior Ministry who often speaks on behalf of the government on media-related matters, said on Thursday that Mr. Sam Rainsy\u2019s petition was \u201cstupid and funny.\u201d He said Facebook was a level playing field where both the government and the opposition were free to promote their pages and make appeals to voters.  \u201cI just tell stupid Sam Rainsy that if he plays Facebook, he should know about this,\u201d Mr. Huy Vannak said. \u201cFacebook has room for everyone to pay and boost their Facebook \u2018likes.\u2019 This is reality.

One study, published by researchers at the University of Oregon in 2016, found that the use of image-based platforms like Instagram and Snapchat was associated with lower levels of loneliness among users, and higher levels of happiness and satisfaction, while text-based platforms had no correlation with improved mental health.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  A heavily visual platform also makes a relatively poor conduit for breaking news and in-the-moment commentary, which might explain why Instagram often feels less exhausting than other social networks. (It also explains why last month, before I went on vacation, I deleted every social media app from my phone except Instagram \u2014 the only app I trusted not to ruin my beachside calm.)  Lesson No. 2: Rethink the share button.  One of Instagram\u2019s most underrated virtues is that it has imposed structural limits on virality \u2014 the ability of a given post to spread beyond its intended audience. Unlike Twitter and Facebook, on Instagram there is no native sharing function, meaning that the reach of most Instagram posts is capped at the number of people who follow the user\u2019s account. (There are ways to \u201cregram\u201d someone else\u2019s photo using a third-party app, but they\u2019re clunky, and relatively few people use them. Instagram also recently began showing users posts from people they don\u2019t follow, a Facebook-inspired change that I\u2019d argue is a mistake.)

View all New York Times newsletters.  A native share button has been tremendously useful for Facebook\u2019s and Twitter\u2019s growth. It has also allowed upstart media organizations like BuzzFeed and Upworthy to build enormous audiences by specializing in highly shareable stories. But ease of sharing has also allowed the loudest and most emotional voices to be rewarded with clicks \u2014 and attention. It\u2019s this incentive structure that has allowed partisans and profiteers to hijack Facebook\u2019s algorithms and spread divisive messages and false news to millions of people.  The easy virality of Facebook also seems to have made individual users more hesitant about opening up. That makes sense \u2014 it\u2019s easier to share a selfie if you know it won\u2019t accidentally find its way into the feeds of a million strangers.  Lesson No. 3: Ban links.  Instagram\u2019s greatest structural advantage, though, may be a result of its decision to go mostly link-free. Links in Instagram captions and comments aren\u2019t clickable, and while some users have found workarounds, the vast majority of Instagram posts aren\u2019t meant to send users to outside websites. (The exceptions are ads, which can contain clickable links and are, not coincidentally, the most troubled part of Instagram\u2019s platform.)  Photo  The walled-garden nature of Instagram has frustrated publishers, who want to send followers out to their websites, where the publishers can earn advertising money and \u201ccontrol the reader experience.\u201d (It\u2019s really just about the money.) But Instagram has wisely refused to give in, perhaps realizing that allowing links might turn the platform into a screeching bazaar, with publishers and pages all doing circus acts for clicks.  Removing links from Facebook would wreak havoc on the digital media industry, which has built an economic model around referral traffic from Facebook. It would also risk alienating some users, who enjoy promoting and discussing stories from other parts of the internet. But it would also solve some of the platform\u2019s most vexing challenges. And ultimately, it would be better for the world.  After all, malicious actors don\u2019t post fabricated news, wildly exaggerated headlines or partisan outrage-bait on Facebook only for fun. They do it, in many cases, because it\u2019s profitable. Take away bad actors\u2019 incentives and they\u2019ll go elsewhere.  Banning most links doesn\u2019t seem to have hurt Instagram as a business. It had more than 800 million monthly active users as of September, and it gained a million new advertisers last year. Facebook doesn\u2019t break out Instagram\u2019s revenue, but some analysts expect the app could one day generate as much as $10 billion in annual revenue. That\u2019s still nowhere near Facebook, which earned $10 billion in revenue last quarter alone, but it\u2019s a meaningful number, and it shows that insularity isn\u2019t always a bad thing.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Lesson No. 4: Bad actors are unavoidable, but their influence can be contained.  Instagram is far from a perfect social network, and copying it wouldn\u2019t fix all of Facebook\u2019s problems overnight. Among other issues, some research has shown that use of Instagram can breed insecurity and bullying, and exacerbate body image issues, especially among young women.

David Kaye, the United Nations\u2019 Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression, said that Facebook would probably face more difficult questions as it rolled out the new ranking program globally.  \u201cWhat will happen in situations where a community determines that a news source is trustworthy, but that news source is censored, or illegal, in that country?\u201d asked Mr. Kaye, noting that in many parts of the world, governments controlled all official news channels while independent news sources were outlawed or forced to publish pseudo-anonymously.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  In the past, he added, Facebook has abided by local rules where it operates abroad.  \u201cWhat will Mark Zuckerberg do when the needs of the community, in what it determines is trusted news, are different from what the government determines. Who will Facebook side with?\u201d said Mr. Kaye.  Raju Narisetti, the chief executive of the Gizmodo Media Group, the unit of Univision that operates Jezebel and other sites, said there was a \u201cgreat irony\u201d that Facebook, which has traditionally left decision up to an algorithm that incorporates the behaviors of its members, would open the decision-making to its users on such a matter. He added that the user-generated ranking system \u201cis a massive abdication of its social responsibility, as a vital platform, to be a good custodian of the Fourth Estate globally.\u201d  Other experiments that Facebook has tried with news in the past have sometimes gone awry or had unintended consequences. For example, a recent test to remove all news publishers from the News Feed and to place them under a separate tab in six countries, including Bolivia and Slovakia, yielded an unexpected result of magnifying the amount of fake news on the platform.  In his post on Friday, Mr. Zuckerberg said the newest change \u201cwill only shift the balance of news you see towards sources that are determined to be trusted by the community.\u201d  Facebook said news would be prioritized according to the new ranking system starting Monday, before expanding globally. Some Facebook users have already been asked to rank the trustworthiness of news sites which appear on the social network. In one survey, people were asked if they recognized a number of websites and then asked, \u201c\u201cHow much do you trust each of these domains?\u201d They were able to choose from a range of answers, including entirely, a lot, somewhat, barely and not at all.  The Silicon Valley company said it would continue polling users to refine and select which news outlets garnered the most trust. It declined to say how many people were polled or which news outlets they were asked about.  \u201cAs part of our ongoing quality surveys, we asked a diverse and representative sample of Facebook users across the U.S. to gauge their familiarity with, and trust in, sources of news,\u201d said Todd Breasseale, a Facebook spokesman. \u201cWe boost links from sources with high trust scores and demote links from sources with low trust scores.\u201d  Mr. Zuckerberg has been moving Facebook toward taking more responsibility for what shows up on the social network, especially after the criticism over the 2016 election and the interference by Russian agents. Earlier this month, he described his 2018 goals as including \u201cmaking sure that time spent on Facebook is time well spent.\u201d  In Friday\u2019s post, he hinted that ranking the credibility of news sources was just one step, with more potential changes to come.

Previously announced tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, which will also affect China, go into effect on Friday.

First off, let\u2019s clarify that this is happening according to TechCrunch, which spotted the new \u2018Protect\u2019 option over in the US, on Facebook\u2019s iOS app only (not Android). As the site observes, this may mean the social network is only testing the feature at this point with a limited user base over in the States. (Onavo has also been previously pushed in testing over in the UK).  If you click on Protect in the navigation menu, you\u2019ll get taken straight through to the App Store listing for the \u2018Onavo Protect \u2013 VPN Security\u2019 product, which you can obviously install from there.  On the face of it, like any other VPN product, Onavo is designed to keep you more secure online by encrypting the data you transmit over your internet connection (or indeed someone else\u2019s connection, like public Wi-Fi which is potentially insecure).  VPNs are also traditionally designed to maintain your anonymity and privacy online, but notably in Onavo Protect\u2019s store listing, there\u2019s no talk of privacy.  Instead, the app blurb states: \u201cTo provide this [protection], Onavo uses a VPN to establish a secure connection to direct all of your network communications through Onavo\u2019s servers. As part of this process, Onavo collects your mobile data traffic.  \u201cThis helps us improve and operate the Onavo service by analyzing your use of websites, apps and data. Because we're part of Facebook, we also use this info to improve Facebook products and services, gain insights into the products and services people value, and build better experiences.\u201d  Precious data  In other words, rather than maintaining your privacy, the app is making use of the data you send across the VPN connection to provide insights to Facebook on what its users are doing online.  Exactly how Facebook is using this data obviously isn\u2019t clear, although TechCrunch theorizes that the social network could employ it to see which rival apps are swiftly gaining popularity \u2013 for potential early acquisitions \u2013 or which features of other apps are working well (because it can see how many of its users are flocking to them).  That\u2019s all speculation, but what isn\u2019t speculation is that if you use this Onavo VPN, you are signing up to let Facebook use your data for its own insights, whatever they may be.  And Facebook is obviously wanting to push this VPN via its mobile app, although as mentioned at the outset, it\u2019s not clear whether this is just limited testing on the iOS platform at the moment.

In a report where Facebook was updating users on their plans to restrict data access on the social platform, they also revealed that up to 87 million people globally have had their information shared improperly with Cambridge Analytica. Of that 87 million, around 5.6 million users were Indian.  The blog post by Mike Schroepfer, Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at Facebook, shared a graph of the country-specific break-up of users that have been affected by the data breach. Indian users only comprise 0.7% of the total, whereas over 70 million users in the United States were exploited.  Misuse of information stats  In an attempt to correct the problem, Schroepfer wrote of nine changes that Facebook will be making to better protect information about Facebook users. One of them is that the events API will see more strict regulations including the fact that third-party apps will no longer be able to access the guest lists for an event or view posts on the event wall.  The Groups API will also be seeing some changes. It's going to roll back access from third-party apps of viewing member lists of groups and removing posts that have any personal information attached to them.  The more dramatic change is, of course, the announcement that Facebook will be shutting down Partner Categories. A shift that\u2019s more pertinent for regular users is probably the fact that the social platform is going to no longer allow people to search for friends using their email address or phone numbers.

With the Indian elections around the corner, political parties will have to be more wary of how they manage their PR campaigns and conduct research on vote banks.

If you have one gadget and don't use the internet much, in Facebook's eyes you're probably a poor person.  Facebook's application says the algorithm is intended for use by \"third parties to increase awareness about products or services to online system users.\" Examples given include corporations and charities.  The patent essentially tells us that Facebook intends to add class to its advertising preferences. You know, the ones that until very recently allowed advertisers to filter by race and ethnicity, which they dragged their feet about fixing, and still hovers in the realm of \"temporarily disabled.\"  The patent's illustrations tells us a story. It's a tale of upper-class employees indoctrinated, sheltered, and inoculated from outside thinking. Facebook has been literally sitting there going \"what does it mean to be middle class\", defining it themselves, and getting excited about who they can sell class information to.  I love it when a company tells us more about itself like this. \"Working class\" is at the bottom of its graphs.

Meaning, it's not a stretch to think that Facebook will be able to decide from check-ins which restaurants, phones, and brands of shoes, are \"lower class.\"  Oops -- I meant to write \"working class.\" Really.  Open season on opportunity hoarding  Leave it to Facebook to race ahead of Black Mirror. In light of Facebook's recent announcement to focus on more \"concrete local issues\" it's not too hard to imagine how this could be used to keep working class renters out of a particular neighborhood, to facilitate predatory lending, or make sure that lower classes don't see your dating service ads.  This is not a new problem; Facebook is just 'improving' it. After reading the 2014 White House report on data, privacy, algorithms, and discrimination, Google engineer Jeremy Kun wrote:  Here's a not-so-imaginary example of the problem. A bank wants people to take loans with high interest rates, and it also serves ads for these loans. A modern idea is to use an algorithm to decide, based on the sliver of known information about a user visiting a website, which advertisement to present that gives the largest chance of the user clicking on it.  The bank then makes a tasty little ad offering much-needed money for little up front, and the algorithm takes over. Target the lower class, the working class -- which are often people of color, too -- because data shows poor people (those least in a position to take high-interest loans) are more likely than the general population to be so desperate that they'll take on a bad loan.  Kun explains, \"So an algorithm that is 'just' trying to maximize clickthrough may also be targeting black people, de facto denying them opportunities for fair loans.\"  According to Kun, under US law, a practice can be considered discriminatory \"even in the absence of intent.\" In comments he added:  E.g. if people in poorer neighborhoods are disproportionately shown ads for predatory loans because an algorithm decided it has higher clickthrough. They have fewer chances for a fair loan treatment because they aren't exposed to normal loan offers. Is that direct or indirect? In either case, it's illegal. Even if a practice is not racist by intention, it can have an disproportionate adverse impact on a particular racial class, and so it's still considered illegal.  Facebook's algorithm may not be making illegal decisions, but it is absolutely facilitating humans to do so. Welcoming them to it, actually. Not that Facebook lets the law deter them from making a buck. I mean, c'mon.  It's not too hard to think of ways Russia's state-sponsored propaganda trolls will use this new feature either.  Stay classy, Facebook  Well, you're saying, it's just an updated version of Facebook's patent to help lenders discriminate against borrowers based on social connections, isn't it? Which was the inspiration for the parody app, \"Unfriend the Poors.\" And maybe now isn't such a ridiculous idea after all in a reality where you'll probably want to unfriend your mom to raise your credit score before you click on that Facebook ad.  It's hard to keep writing these things off like some sort of idealistic upper class privilege gone awry in a company that surely has tricked some good people into working there, but whose culture and rulebook defends holocaust denial as free speech. A company that is failing to curb a proliferation of users who advocate for, and until recently bought ads that endorse, soft-peddled ethnic cleansing. Just another of Facebook's naive evils cross-fading into another.  Facebook tells us that it considers itself a moral company. But we know. We know that Facebook upsets the moral order because it continues to act perilously, without impunity.  So what have we learned this week? We've learned that the working class that actually exists isn't anything like the fantasies and prejudices of affluent, sheltered Facebook employees. Like the ones who've been hoarding buildings in working-class San Francisco neighborhoods, putting local small business owners out of business.  And if they wanted to escape those fantasies and prejudices to find out what we're all really experiencing, their best bet would be to quit their jobs at Facebook and to go get actual working-class jobs (and be subjected to the other side of the Facebook experience as well).  It may not give them an actual clue. But at least we wouldn't have to put up with them destroying democracy and its foundational principle of equality anymore.

Actions that, despite Facebook's pearl-clutching in the press, are starting to look more and more in concert.  To be clear, Facebook knew what Cambridge Analytica did, but only (partly) acted on it when the press made it public knowledge. It was more than two years ago -- December 2015 -- when The Guardian published its first report about Cambridge Analytica using Facebook data to target US voters. Facebook didn't suspend them until last Friday. Cambridge Analytica maintained its access for years, while one of its chief officers worked at Facebook -- and while Facebook employees were embedded in the Trump campaign's digital media operation.  Keep in mind that Trump won by well-placed Electoral College votes: 77,744 to be precise. Before Cambridge Analytica came along, Trump had \"no unifying data, digital and tech strategy,\" according to leaks made public today by The Guardian. With its Facebook data, they ran Facebook ads disguised as news stories, linked to fake news sites, and targeted Facebook users they deemed especially susceptible. Then Cambridge Analytica tracked those Facebook users across the internet and re-targeted them. Russia's trolls did the rest, providing all the confirmation and social proof needed.  So, long after Facebook knew that Cambridge Analytica had mined data from millions of unwitting users, a Facebook board member (Thiel) gave $1 million to a PAC that was paying the company that covertly harvested user data.    ... from Facebook. https://t.co/osOJDj3Wx7 \u2014 Caroline O. (@RVAwonk) March 22, 2018  When the The Guardian's 2015 article came out, Facebook pretended to care.  \"And then,\" former Cambridge Analytica employee Christopher Wylie told The Observer, \"all they did was write a letter.  \"But literally all I had to do was tick a box and sign it and send it back, and that was it,\" says Wylie. \"Facebook made zero effort to get the data back.\"  Over the weekend, press characterized Wylie as a whistleblower. Which I suppose is easy to do if we're going to forget where all of this data dealing and vote-influencing has led -- the indisputable rise of hate groups in the US since the 2016 election, Facebook's churning cauldron of racist communities and deadly Nazi rallies, among others. Writer Joseph Guthrie tweeted, \"If I ever meet Chris Wylie, there will be no pleasantries. This isn't something you can apologise for and we all just move on. The price paid is too great a cost to ignore and again: assuming he's a queer man like I am, his involvement in this thing is a catastrophic betrayal.\"  Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie  It wasn't until the NYT and The Observer prepared to publish their articles last Friday that Facebook decided to suspend Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie from the platform -- in a weak attempt to get ahead of the story. Even then, it was after Facebook made legal threats against both NYT and The Observer in an effort to silence both publications.  So it was well-known internally at Facebook years ago that Cambridge Analytica extracted a lot of seriously sensitive user data through Facebook APIs, then used it for precision ad targeting (which Facebook could've vetted). It speaks volumes about Facebook -- and all its efforts to distract from this issue -- that it allowed a huge amount of sensitive data to get into the hands of unauthorized third parties ... and took years to take any action other than pinky swears.  It almost goes without saying that this whole sickening affair is more proof we didn't need that Facebook only cares when it is forced to: When the company decides it has a reputation problem. Which is the only problem they actually care about fixing. Other than that, it's all about creating more data dealer WMDs, like Facebook's impending patent to determine social class, which we can all assume will be abused until press who can afford to stand up to Facebook write an article about it.  But when you're Facebook, victimhood is performative.  A Facebook spokesperson released a statement Tuesday saying \"the entire company is outraged we were deceived.\" Obviously. They were so paralyzed by rage that they couldn't even bring themselves to do anything about it for over two years. During which time they rolled out several \"upgrades\" to their privacy systems and terms, and rolled out \"enhanced\" features to improve the experience. They were so mad they even hired the Global Science Research officer that sold Cambridge Analytica's users' data.  Bogglingly, the official Facebook response on Wednesday began with the sentence, \"Protecting people's information is the most important thing we do at Facebook. What happened with Cambridge Analytica was a breach of Facebook's trust.\"  Wednesday was also the day of Mark Zuckerberg's carefully crafted mea culpa press tour. It was an afternoon masterclass on softball interviews. No questions about knowingly hiring Cambridge Analytica's Joseph Chancellor. No queries about threatening to sue The Observer to prevent the information from getting out. You know, the whole reason he's sitting there being interviewed. It was almost like everyone at CNN, WIRED, Re/Code and NYT wanted Zuckerberg to feel safe. Comfortable. Far away from accepting anything like liability. Giving him a voice with which to explain his feelings of betrayal and all about his determination to do better while effectively changing nothing.  When the only thing that actually changed is people found out about it.  I particularly loved WIRED's feel of a chat over coffee, asking Zuckerberg what \"philosophical changes\" have been going through his mind lately. He got to say how, gosh, he really wishes he didn't have to deal with making decisions about content that promotes opposition of gender and racial equality. Which he shamelessly believes is a diverse and underserved point of view. As if fairness means incorporating, if not humoring and tolerating, ruinous disinformation campaigns, the beliefs of white nationalists, neo-Nazis, and fascists working for the most disastrous president in US history.  \"A lot of the most sensitive issues that we face today are conflicts between real values, right? Freedom of speech, and hate speech and offensive content. Where is the line?\" he said to Re/Code. \"What I would really like to do is find a way to get our policies set in a way that reflects the values of the community so I am not the one making those decisions.\"  Yep. While his company is the world leader in content censorship of art, human sexuality, and black activists, Mark Zuckerberg literally never imagined he'd someday be in the position to do the right thing about hate speech. And wishes he didn't have to.  That Facebook only pretends to care -- in the ways least affecting its business model -- isn't new. Nor is that the company is having yet another (temporary) \"come to Jesus\" moment about honesty when its hand is forced. Apology tours are its speciality.  Look, Zuckerberg did say sorry -- that they \"let the community down.\" It felt just as real as all of Facebook's regular apologies over the past ten years or so. I can't wait for the next one.  Zuckerberg also shored up his assurances to press this week by stating that Facebook would be beefing up its security team. He said, \"We're going to have 20,000 people working on security and content review in this company by the end of this year.\"  Facebook can hire all the security it wants. It won't do anything to protect us from Facebook.

Shown, Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg spoke at the annual Facebook developers conference in April 2017. Photo: Stephen Lam/REUTERS  What do Facebook Inc., FB 0.40% the Soviet Union and the European Reformation have in common? They all consist of networks that formed quickly by leveraging new communications technologies and then just as swiftly were taken over by a handful of people who consolidated their influence over millions of people.  Some historians and scientists are coming to understand that the internet\u2014and specifically Facebook\u2014are only the latest examples of the revolution-spawning networks, common throughout history, that give rise to hierarchies that both empower and oppress.  In an indictment released Friday, special prosecutor Robert Mueller described a scenario in which Russian operatives allegedly exploited Facebook with the intent of influencing the 2016 U.S. election. That Facebook could be used in this way should be no surprise, because research has shown that the downside of powerful, centralized networks is their susceptibility to being subverted and exploited.  As recently as the Arab Spring in 2011, sober-sounding intellectuals could plausibly argue that the disruptive force of the internet, capable of upending old hierarchies, would provide the means to spread democracy and grant new freedoms.  That view, said historian Niall Ferguson, author of the 2018 book \u201cThe Square and the Tower: Networks and Power, From the Freemasons to Facebook,\u201d was born of an all-too-common mistake: the failure to appreciate that, even when new technologies come along, it\u2019s still humans who are using them.  \u201cFrom 1990s slogans about how we\u2019re all \u2018netizens\u2019 to the recent Facebook talk of a global community, we\u2019ve heard this argument ad nauseam,\u201d Mr. Ferguson said. \u201cAnd I think it has slightly robbed us of our critical faculties.\u201d  Understanding why this happens\u2014why networks start out as distributed power structures but quickly become vertical hierarchies capable of rapidly disseminating both information and propaganda\u2014requires a little network theory and some historical perspective.  A woman surrounded by images of Vladimir Lenin at \u2018The Epoch of Lenin\u2019 a private museum in Polotsk, Belarus, owned by collector Nikolai Pankrat, in October. Photo: sergei gapon/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images  Take the Bolshevik revolutions of 1917, for instance. The coalition of the armed forces and the industrial workforce that overthrew the czar was, essentially, a distributed network. But the circle of insiders who subsequently consolidated power over the Communist Party\u2014whose control peaked with the rule of Joseph Stalin\u2014is the hierarchy.  \u201cA hierarchy is just a special kind of network where some nodes have higher centrality\u2014the ones through which others have to communicate or pass,\u201d Mr. Ferguson said.  Technology usually plays a role in revolutionary change. In Russia, it was telegraphs and railroads. In the case of the Reformation, the printing press allowed for the rapid spread of the Bible in local languages. The distributed network of believers posed a sudden threat to the established Catholic hierarchy, yet once Protestantism achieved critical mass, its own hierarchy arose.  With the printed vernacular bible, Martin Luther envisioned a network of believers in Europe but not 200 years of civil war. Photo: ullstein bild/Getty Images  \u201cLuther thought that it would be great if everyone was connected and could read the Bible in the vernacular,\u201d Mr. Ferguson said. What Luther didn\u2019t anticipate is what would come next\u2014nearly 200 years of civil war.  \u201cWhat happened in the 16th century in Europe is visible in American politics today, where you have two pretty hostile and separate spheres of conservatives and liberals who are scarcely communicating across a largely vacated middle,\u201d Mr. Ferguson said.  To see how the power of nation- or globe-spanning networks can be exploited, look at China\u2019s transformation of its internet into the world\u2019s most sophisticated machine for censorship, surveillance and social control.  The distributed nature of the internet should have posed a major threat to a country like China. As internet activist John Gilmore once said, \u201cThe net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it.\u201d  Recognizing this, China built its portion of the internet from the start as a hierarchy in which internet companies can only rent bandwidth from government-controlled service providers. In other words, all traffic is routed through a limited number of powerful, central nodes.  China's President Xi Jinping is seen on a screen in front of logos of China's leading internet companies at the World internet Conference in Wuzhen, in China\u2019s Zhejiang province, in December. Photo: aly song/Reuters  Even when networks aren\u2019t architected for this kind of control, they tend to organize themselves in ways that lead to disproportionate influence by a handful of their members. When any new person or entity joins a network, it is likely to attach to the most visible hubs, making them even more influential, said Albert-L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Barab\u00e1si, a theoretical physicist and a founder of the field of network science.  In just a few years, Facebook became the world\u2019s most dominant conduit of news and information but said it would remain neutral to what spread through its channels. Meanwhile, a handful of engineers were building algorithms to decide which of its 2.2 billion users would see what.  By remaining agnostic about which influencers rose to popularity, and helping them along by building recommendation and newsfeed algorithms to enhance that popularity, Facebook allowed Russia to rapidly gain influence on the site, said Nicholas Christakis, a physician and sociologist at Yale who studies social networks.  The company has taken steps to address these problems, but it\u2019s Facebook\u2019s \u201coriginal sin\u201d\u2014to optimize for engagement above all else as a servant of advertisers as much as of users\u2014that is at the root of its issues, Dr. Christakis said.  According to Dr. Christakis, \u201cYou can connect a group of people one way and they\u2019re kind, and cooperation spreads. But if you take the same group of people and connect them in a different way, they\u2019re mean sons of bitches, and they\u2019re cruel to each other.\u201d  Facebook isn\u2019t the only internet power structure like this, of course. All the top social networks that use algorithmic feeds to feature content have been exploited in similar ways. Alphabet Inc.\u2019s YouTube recently came under fire for allowing its artificial intelligence to promote extremist views. And in Friday\u2019s indictment, Mr. Mueller named Twitter Inc. and Facebook-owned Instagram as well.  Historically, the only way to deal with this problem has been to disrupt an established network with a fresh one. Fostering competition could shift power away from Facebook. Yet many have begun to argue that Facebook, with its dominance of social media, should be treated as a monopoly, and even broken up. One could argue that the grounds for doing so now include national security.

Corporate consultants would normally regard such communication as sub-optimal, but today\u2019s late rally on Wall Street suggests that investors are looking beyond the bit fight. The Journal reports:  The pullbacks were the result of bad publicity. Separately the Journal explains why investors are willing to overlook a lot of bad headlines among the technology companies in the S&P 500:  They are expected to post 22% earnings growth in the first quarter, which would be a strong showing even for a sector that typically grows its earnings quite rapidly.  Much of the media has lately been having fun pretending that a company called Cambridge Analytica, making unauthorized use of personal data from Facebook, played an important role in persuading people to vote for Donald Trump in 2016.  In recent trading sessions, the dubious argument has had real consequences as investors have marked down the value of Facebook and other tech companies by billions of dollars. The thesis among sellers of such stocks is that the Washington swamp will now impose expensive regulation to punish Facebook for allegedly being useful to Mr. Trump. Buyers of the stock figure that Facebook can accommodate new rules and may even benefit if regulation erects barriers to new competitors. The joke circulating among Harvard alumni is that at least their old schoolmate Mark Zuckerberg won\u2019t be President now.  At the moment the Facebook founder and CEO doesn\u2019t even seem like a viable candidate to run for president of the Silicon Valley chamber of commerce. Bloomberg reports:  Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg has found himself with few defenders in the technology industry.  Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook, Tesla Inc.\u2019s Elon Musk and Salesforce.com Inc.\u2019s Marc Benioff have criticized the social media network in the wake of its user data scandal involving political-advertising firm Cambridge Analytica. Other tech leaders have remained quiet in the ensuing backlash against Facebook, in contrast to Silicon Valley\u2019s usual practice of rallying around its own during major crises.  Apple\u2019s Mr. Cook has offered perhaps the sharpest critique of Facebook\u2019s data collection, saying last week: \u201cThe truth is, we could make a ton of money if we monetized our customer \u2014 if our customer was our product. We\u2019ve elected not to do that.\u201d  In an interview posted this week on Vox, a website for young adults, Mr. Zuckerberg responded by comparing Facebook\u2019s advertiser-supported service which doesn\u2019t charge users to the Apple business model of charging consumers premium prices for hardware:  You know, I find that argument, that if you\u2019re not paying that somehow we can\u2019t care about you, to be extremely glib and not at all aligned with the truth. The reality here is that if you want to build a service that helps connect everyone in the world, then there are a lot of people who can\u2019t afford to pay. And therefore, as with a lot of media, having an advertising-supported model is the only rational model that can support building this service to reach people.  ...if you want to build a service which is not just serving rich people, then you need to have something that people can afford.  It seems that Mr. Zuckerberg will continue to offer an affordable service--assuming consumers don\u2019t regard sharing their personal information as too high a price to pay for social media. Speaking of costs and benefits, Mr. Zuckerberg makes clear in his Vox interview that Facebook is becoming a more aggressive media gatekeeper:  In 2016, we were behind having an understanding and operational excellence on preventing things like misinformation, Russian interference. And you can bet that\u2019s a huge focus for us going forward...  After the 2016 US elections, a number of months later, there were the French elections. And for that, we spent a bunch of time developing new AI tools to find the kind of fake accounts spreading misinformation and we took down \u2014 I think it was more than 30,000 accounts, and I think the reports out of France were that people felt like that was a much cleaner election on social media.  A few months later, there were the German elections. And there, we augmented the playbook again to work directly with the election commission in Germany. If you work with the government in a country, they\u2019ll really actually have a fuller understanding of what is going on and what are all the issues that we would need to focus on.  The idea of Facebook working with governments around the world to filter news is more frightening than almost any commercial use of user data one can imagine.  In a recent letter to the editor of this newspaper, Rodger Cornell of Kinsale, Va. no doubt speaks for many readers in addressing new proposals to filter Internet content on services like Facebook:  During most of my adult life the news that I received was indeed filtered, in most instances by liberal newspaper editors. I\u2019ll take my chances on a wide-open internet, thank you.  ***  Bottom Stories of the Day will return on Wednesday.  ***  Follow James Freeman on Twitter.

Now the mobs are howling after Facebook , Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s creature.  It is true that Facebook\u2019s release of personal \u201cfriend data\u201d into the ozone through Cambridge Analytica remains in the news only because of the prevailing superstition that the Facebook monster allowed Donald Trump to be elected president. The idea that omnipotent technology manipulated the 2016 election has greater appeal to advanced progressive thinking than Hillary Clinton\u2019s explanation that married white women sold her out.  But really, all that is a sideshow. The backlash against this technology, the belief that the creature must be controlled, has been building for several years. Along with Google, Facebook is the biggest web target, so Mark Zuckerberg is about to get torched by Congress and any regulator within reach for abusing \u201cdata.\u201d  Data is the oxygen of the internet. Any online click for any reason inputs data. In the beginning this data, organized into things like family Facebook groups or Google Maps or Wikipedia, was seen as good.  For several years BTTP\u2014BTTP being human history Before The Trump Presidency \u2014articles and books poured forth describing the dark side of this technology. In the past year, that criticism has reached critical mass.  Researchers and parents agree that social media is distorting the lives of young people, especially adolescent girls. No one knows what to do about it.  Web forums fill with millions of young men exchanging sexual and political rants. No one knows what to do about it.  Terrorists wallow in jihadist videos on YouTube, brainwashing themselves into acts of mass murder. No one knows what to do about it.  People write articles saying they have forgotten how to read books.  Major advertisers accuse social-media companies of allowing their ads to appear alongside pornography, a bog beyond anyone\u2019s control.  The cyberwarfare spies of Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency ran around the U.S. uncaught for years.  Social media\u2019s contribution to the Arab Spring and Ukraine\u2019s Orange Revolution was an era ago. The technology has been captured since by dictators who use it as an instrument of surveillance and control that would startle Philip K. Dick.  In one week, Facebook the good communitarian has become Facebook the abuser of everyone\u2019s privacy.  The story of Frankenstein endures as a metaphor of good intentions gone haywire because it keeps happening. Some people used to argue that because Albert Einstein explained how energy could be released from atoms, he bore responsibility for the atomic bomb. By this logic blame should fall on Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, for electing Donald Trump.  Do not for a moment think that Mr. Zuckerberg, Mr. Berners-Lee or any of the others who created modern life online are unaware that history may conclude their creations were a mistake.  Mr. Berners-Lee, reacting to the Facebook mess, accused social-media companies of abusing his creation: \u201cThe fact that power is concentrated among so few companies has made it possible to weaponize the web at scale.\u201d  \u201cWeaponize\u201d evokes the idea of dual-use technology, which is tech that can be put to both a peaceful and military purpose, such as rocket guidance systems. The internet has finally been recognized as a dual-use technology, good and bad.  Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s CEO and inheritor of Steve Jobs\u2019s creations, weighed in this week, ironically from China, the global leader in Orwellian surveillance systems. \u201cThe ability of anyone to know what you\u2019ve been browsing about for years,\u201d said Mr. Cook, \u201cwho your contacts are, who their contacts are, things you like and dislike and every intimate detail of your life\u2014from my own point of view it shouldn\u2019t exist.\u201d Of course, the iPhone became the universal gateway into this dystopia.  One can imagine that when Sergey Brin and Larry Page created Google\u2019s early motto, \u201cDon\u2019t Be Evil,\u201d they sensed what Robert Oppenheimer and his colleagues on the Manhattan Project knew: The power of what they had created might be a problem.  Back when superstition ruled the world, the solution to a larger-than-life problem was known as forcing the genie back into the bottle. Today, when algorithms rule the world, one would think that an industry with aggregate IQ greater than any ever assembled could figure this out. But maybe IQ correlates with the problem.  If the issue is privacy, why does every app and site incentivize users to scroll past pages of legal boilerplate to hit \u201cI Agree,\u201d rather than writing up top in large type: \u201cTHIS IS THE ONE SENTENCE YOU\u2019VE GOTTA THINK ABOUT BEFORE YOU AGREE\u201d?  There is another alternative to trying to dam up the internet torrent with regulation: Every time anyone clicks into an app or search engine, they should see this more needed personal motto for our times: Don\u2019t Be Stupid.

I was in New York with the fall term\u2019s last classes to teach, so I compartmentalized. I didn\u2019t learn he had died until I arrived home at 10:30.  Stunned, I checked to see whether my family had announced our loss. Hours earlier, an acquaintance had posted on my Facebook page: \u201cSorry about your dad.\u201d Others sent condolences privately, but still before I had heard the news. Turned out, everyone had read my 20-year-old nephew Sam\u2019s poignant tribute at 7 p.m.: \u201cThank you for all you have given, Grandpa.\u201d  The speedy digital death messages that night felt devastating. I appreciated everyone\u2019s desire to connect, but there are more-sensitive ways to sympathize online:  Photo: istock/Getty Images  \u2022 Slow down. If you hear of a death secondhand, don\u2019t race to call, text or post. Check if an obituary has been published, if someone has personally shared the news, or if the funeral home has announced a service. Otherwise you could be the messenger. Paper cards may be more thoughtful anyway.  \u2022 Don\u2019t waste money. With broke friends, I\u2019ve sent a check or donated directly to cover burial costs. That wasn\u2019t our case. Flowers and food baskets are generous, but my family preferred all donations to go to the needy. My parents grew up poor, dad a street kid on New York\u2019s Lower East Side. His pride was putting his four kids through college and arranging educational trusts for his grandkids. I finally posted a few of his charities on Facebook: the medical school where he taught and a Hasidic nonprofit that helps kids with special needs. Since my conservative father and I argued politics (he characterized my candidate, Hillary, and her husband as \u201cBonnie and Clyde,\u201d while I called his \u201cDrumpf\u201d), I added the Israel Defense Forces, our shared passion, as a concession. When notices of donations came in, I cherished them as if dad were still doing good in the world.  \u2022 No advice. After we chose Sunday for the funeral, I completed my classes and attended a long-scheduled academic panel. Dad, a fellow workaholic, loved my teaching (\u201cfinally a real job!\u201d). Several people suggested I cancel, bury him sooner, or have a separate Manhattan shiva. Unless you\u2019re asked, hold your opinion.  \u2022 Forget yourself and your loss. Well-wishers updated me on their dads\u2019 ages and sicknesses, as if competing in the Grief Olympics. One said she couldn\u2019t attend the service because of her father\u2019s recovery. A co-worker compared it to losing her cat. Try \u201cSorry to hear\u201d or \u201cSending love.\u201d  \u2022 Respond to what\u2019s shared. Cyberspace helped me mourn. The chapel taped and offered a link to dad\u2019s memorial, which I posted. I loved when out-of-towners commented on my eulogy, adding their own recollections. Our old neighbor, David, recalled Dad rushing over when he fell sick at 3 a.m. That made me feel closer to my father, Jack Shapiro, a Leo born under a lucky star. Tagging him reminded me that my staid 85-year-old dad was on Facebook, where he\u2019ll live forever, my political foe and eternal friend.  Ms. Shapiro, a New School professor, is a co-author of \u201cThe Bosnia List\u201d (Penguin, 2014) and author of \u201cLighting Up\u201d (Delacorte, 2004).", "stock": "FB"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-to-streamline-privacy-settings-1522234802", "label": 1, "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "date": "2018-03-28", "article": "Facebook Inc., FB 0.40% facing a firestorm over how it handles personal information, says it will make it simpler for users to examine and change some of the data about them that the social network tracks.  The tweaks, announced Wednesday and set to roll out in the coming weeks, include a new, central hub in the Facebook app settings that contains existing tools for users to review and, if desired, delete traces of their Facebook activity such as past posts and search terms. Some other data, such as which ads users clicked on, still won\u2019t be erasable. Facebook says any information users delete is wiped from its servers.  Facebook will also redesign its settings menu for mobile devices, now spread out across almost 20 different screens, and consolidate \u200bits privacy and security options in a single place.  The moves are part of broader changes Facebook is planning to bolster privacy, said Rob Sherman, Facebook\u2019s deputy privacy officer. They come amid intensifying scrutiny from users, regulators and lawmakers over Facebook\u2019s admission on March 16 that user data was improperly obtained by Cambridge Analytica, a data-analytics firm that worked for the 2016 Trump campaign.  The backlash has shaken Facebook and hammered its stock, cleaving more than $95 billion off its market value in just over a week. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg apologized last week for a \u201cmajor breach of trust\u201d in the Cambridge Analytica episode and is expected to testify before U.S. lawmakers on data-use practices next month.  \u201cIt\u2019s been a very intense week,\u201d Mr. Sherman said in an interview. \u201cOne thing that\u2019s been really clear is that we\u2019ve lost people\u2019s trust and need to do a lot of work right away to work on regaining it.\u201d  The Cambridge Analytica revelation showed limits to Facebook\u2019s enforcement of rules governing outsiders\u2019 handling of user data and its ability to see how third parties may have used Facebook data. Facebook says the firm obtained the data, involving potentially tens of millions of users, in violation of its rules from an app developer that was allowed to have the information but not to sell it. It is investigating whether Cambridge Analytica kept the data after Facebook demanded it be deleted in 2015. Cambridge Analytica has said it followed Facebook\u2019s policies.  The episode has prompted renewed attention to how much information about its users Facebook tracks, and accelerated government scrutiny of the social network, which is already under the microscope for its role in allowing Russian-backed groups to use its tools to sway U.S. political discourse before and after the 2016 presidential race.  In a March 21 post, Mr. Zuckerberg said Facebook would investigate and audit app creators who may have abused personal data about Facebook users as well as restrict the amount of information available to developers. At the same time, he said, Facebook is limited in its ability to uncover instances of data misuse because the information is impossible to track once it is downloaded off Facebook servers.  Mr. Sherman also said Facebook faces challenges in determining how data provided to app creators in the past may have been misused over time. But he said the effort is vital. \u201cPeople will only feel comfortable using Facebook if they have confidence that their information will be protected,\u201d he said.  Facebook's current data crisis involving Cambridge Analytica has angered users and prompted government investigations. To understand what's happening now, you have to look back at Facebook's old policies from 2007 to 2014. WSJ's Shelby Holliday explains.

Facebook has struggled to respond to mounting ire from users, politicians, customers and others over its role in facilitating the spread of misinformation and divisive content. Photo: Paul Sakuma/Associated Press  Facebook Inc. FB 0.40% is contending with a new wave of criticism prompted by the U.S. indictment alleging that Russia manipulated social-media platforms\u2014and by a Facebook executive\u2019s attempts to address the issue.  The indictment against Russian companies and individuals described how an organization called the Internet Research Agency allegedly used Facebook, Twitter Inc., TWTR -0.83% and the YouTube arm of Alphabet Inc.\u2019s GOOGL -0.12% Google to sow discord in the U.S. starting in 2014. The document\u2019s description of events showed that Facebook and its Instagram photo-sharing unit were particularly central to the alleged Russian attempts to influence U.S. public opinion.  Researchers who study social media said the indictment, secured by special counsel Robert Mueller, showed that Facebook was ill-prepared for such efforts. Facebook has more than 25,000 employees, but fewer than 100 Russian provocateurs armed with social-media savvy and widely available technological tools were able to manipulate its platform for years, the indictment says.  Comments by Facebook\u2019s head of advertising, Rob Goldman, after the indictment was handed up Friday fueled further criticism. Mr. Goldman, writing on Twitter, said there are \u201ceasy ways to fight\u201d the Russian campaign, starting with having a \u201cwell educated citizenry.\u201d He also tweeted that the Russians\u2019 main goal wasn\u2019t to sway the 2016 election, but more broadly to sow division in the U.S.  Mr. Goldman\u2019s series of eight tweets provoked more than 9,000 responses on Twitter, many of them angry.  \u201cYou really are not in a position to preach and your astonishing tweets have created confusion and anger,\u201d Mainardo de Nardis, a senior executive at advertising giant Omnicom Group Inc., said in a tweet Sunday. \u201cEnough damage done over the past 2+ years. In the absence of real actions silence would be appreciated.\u201d Mr. de Nardis didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.  A Facebook spokesman said Mr. Goldman, who didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment, had sent his tweets in a personal capacity. The company pointed to a statement from Joel Kaplan, Facebook\u2019s vice president of global public policy, saying, \u201cNothing we found contradicts the Special Counsel\u2019s indictments.\u201d  Russia\u2019s government has repeatedly denied any government effort to influence the U.S. election.  Facebook has struggled for much of the past year to respond to mounting ire from users, politicians, customers and others over its role in facilitating the spread of misinformation and divisive content.  The indictment shows that \u201cthere are lots of levers that get pulled in social media for the sake of manipulation and a lot of those levers aren\u2019t even known by the companies themselves,\u201d said Sam Woolley, an Oxford University research associate who has studied propaganda efforts on social-media platforms.  The indictment documented an unprecedented manipulation campaign targeting Facebook, its Instagram platform, Twitter and YouTube. Starting in 2014, the Russians built an influence operation that drew followers to bogus accounts that spread disinformation, organized U.S. demonstrations and even paid a person to dress up like Hillary Clinton in a prison uniform at a West Palm Beach, Fla., rally, the indictment says.  While much of the attention around the Russian manipulation focused on its efforts to stoke divisions ahead the 2016 U.S. presidential election, it is clear the campaign continued since then. The Wall Street Journal reported in October that some of the Russian-backed social-media accounts posted divisive messages at least as recently as last August.  The Twitter comments of Mr. Goldman, Facebook\u2019s head of advertising, also fueled disagreement about the intent of the Russian efforts. One of Mr. Goldman\u2019s tweets said \u201cswaying the election was *NOT* the main goal\u201d of the Russian ads, and that \u201cthe majority of the Russian ad spend happened AFTER the election.\u201d  On Saturday, President Donald Trump cited Mr. Goldman\u2019s comment in support of the idea that Russia\u2019s actions didn\u2019t affect the election.  Following criticism that he was obscuring the intent of the Russians, Mr. Goldman later tweeted that \u201cthe Russian campaign was certainly in favor of Mr. Trump.\u201d He also dialed back some of his claims. \u201cI am only speaking here about the Russian behavior on Facebook. That is the only aspect that I observed directly,\u201d he tweeted.  Clint Watts, a fellow with the Foreign Policy Research Institute who studied the Russian influence campaign, said the ads bought on Facebook were only \u201ca much smaller part of a very large effort.\u201d  \u201cMr. Goldman should have stayed silent,\u201d Mr. Watts said, adding that playing down the effect of the influence campaign risked further angering Americans. \u201cThe public is upset that they got duped on Facebook\u2019s platform. Facebook got duped,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes it seem like they don\u2019t get it.\u201d  While Facebook\u2019s role in the Russian campaign is in the spotlight, some researchers who have studied the efforts note that it was far from the only institution to fall short.  \u201cLet\u2019s not mince words. The Obama administration did not react quickly enough to this problem. The intelligence community did not react quickly enough to this problem,\u201d said Thomas Rid, professor of strategic studies at Johns Hopkins University.  Facebook has said it is taking a number of steps to prevent efforts like the Russian campaign from happening again, including hiring 10,000 employees tasked with policing hate speech, as well as coming up with ways to uproot fake accounts. Facebook officials also have emphasized that the company provided information to Mr. Mueller.  Based on the information that's now coming out of congressional committees, Russian goals to interfere in the 2016 election were very broad. WSJ's Gerald F. Seib explains just how sophisticated the Russian efforts were using social media. Photo: AP (Originally published Nov. 2, 2017)  Mr. Goldman, too, said Facebook is taking \u201caggressive steps to prevent this sort of meddling in the future,\u201d including verification for all political advertisers. Still, his comments struck some observers as tone deaf.  \u201cIt was an almost perfect example of Silicon Valley overconfidence and lack of sophistication when it comes to politics,\u201d said Josh Hendler, former director of technology for the Democratic National Committee, which suffered a cyberattack ahead of the 2016 election that U.S. officials blamed on Russia.

And Arizona on Monday suspended permission for Uber to test self-driving vehicles on public streets.

Pitzer estimated that AMD sold about $320 million in chips to blockchain companies in 2017, but it was a fraction of AMD\u2019s full-year revenue of over $5 billion.  While blockchain was a fluid and dynamic market, AMD saw strength in December and going into the first quarter, AMD Chief Executive Lisa Su said on a post-earnings call on Tuesday.

Twitter Inc. led the plunge with a 12 percent decline as all 10 index members retreated. Facebook Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Netflix Inc. and Google\u2019s parent Alphabet Inc. slumped at least 3.8 percent.  Many of the big names in the industry had their own reasons for bad days: Twitter being targeted by short sellers, Facebook\u2019s ongoing privacy scandal and Nvidia Corp.\u2019s suspension of driving vehicle testing, for starters. Not to mention growing doubts over Tesla Inc.\u2019s new models and a second probe into a car crash.  But for skeptics such as Jeff Gundlach and Howard Marks, the plunge is long overdue. The FANG index\u2019s advance from early 2016 through this month\u2019s peak reached an annualized rate of 67 percent, outpacing even the Nasdaq Composite Index\u2019s return in the final two years of the dot-com bubble.  \u201cIt\u2019s been such a good performer that at this point it\u2019s kind of on the defensive,\u201d Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Co., said by phone. \u201cThere\u2019s so many people with so many gains in technology.\u201d  There is also a valuation case to be made for the intensified selling.

The computer-chip maker Nvidia Corp. didn't fumble an earnings forecast, but its stock tumbled this week, too. Facebook Inc.'s financial power hasn't weakened (so far), yet it has shed a Morgan Stanley worth of market value in two weeks.  Right now, investors worry technology companies might succumb not to competition or business missteps, but to consequences of their own hubris or market power. It all feels overdue, but also odd. We've been writing for so long about the looming technology reckoning that it's surprising to realize investors finally care.  Amazon's stock price fell 4.4 percent on Wednesday after Axios reported that President Donald Trump is \"obsessed\" with the e-commerce titan and imagines ways to curtail its power. In a tweet on Thursday, Trump confirmed that he's concerned about Amazon's impact on cities and states, the U.S. Postal Service and smaller retailers. In response, Amazon shares are falling in early trading.  Facebook has dropped since revelations that a political consulting firm took advantage of the company's formerly lax data rules. Nvidia shares are down almost 10 percent this week after the company said it would suspend tests of driverless cars on public roads in response to an Uber autonomous car hitting and killing a pedestrian. (Nvidia provides technology for Uber's autonomous cars.)  Feeling the Pain A half dozen prominent U.S. tech companies have lost more than $80 billion of combined stock market value this week Source: Bloomberg  These companies aren't all faultless victims. Amazon is not a cuddly charity. Years of Facebook's cavalier attitude about data privacy and the downsides of its social network have created this crisis. Right now, though, investors are realizing that tech companies are so big, pervasive and economically important that suspicion is a permanent fact of life now, and backlash has become a real cost of doing business.  I was both surprised, and not, at Amazon's stock reaction. The U.S. president's antipathy for Amazon or CEO Jeff Bezos is no secret. Last summer, Trump tweeted a not-quite-accurate criticism about Amazon's tax payments. He also said previously that Amazon had a \"huge antitrust problem,\" and tweeted that the company is hurting U.S. cities and states. In December and again in Thursday's tweet, Trump said the U.S. Postal Service's finances were hurt by its business with Amazon. (That one is more complicated than 280 characters can convey). It's tough to know whether Trump truly believes Amazon is causing harm, or whether he harbors a grudge against the Bezos-owned Washington Post. Maybe both.  Trump isn't alone in questioning Amazon's power, but there's not an easy legal weapon to wield. Axios said Trump has \"talked about changing Amazon's tax treatment,\" but it's not clear how tax changes could specifically target Amazon. The company is well-regarded by consumers. Amazon is a bogeyman of many industries, but it only captures perhaps a few percentage points of total U.S. retail spending. Conventional approaches to antitrust law don't apply easily to Amazon, although some academics have said the applications of the law need to change. And needless to say, the White House doesn't directly control U.S. antitrust authorities.  Losing Their Bite An index of 10 large global technology companies, including Facebook and Apple, has dipped 14 percent from a mid-March peak Source: Bloomberg  Assuming Trump's tweet barrage against Amazon doesn't continue, the company's stock decline is likely to be short-lived. But investors' temporary panic is understandable. It's far better for powerful tech companies like Amazon to fly under the radar right now. Apple and Amazon should have sent thank-you cards to Mark Zuckerberg for drawing 100 percent of the fire recently from members of Congress, global regulators and skeptical tech journalists. But the fresh glimpse at Trump's thinking showed that there's plenty of unwanted attention to go around for the tech giants.  There's also general investor rethinking -- not for the first time -- about the tech concentration in the stock market after several years of outsize gains in the sector. As with market reaction to the tech backlash, this has little to do with the tech superpowers' current businesses, which remain solid. Nothing has changed. Except everything has changed.

Ognar is unmoved: \u201cWe don\u2019t think the party is over.\u201d Nor do the bulk of his fund-manager peers, as it turns out. Behind the ugly headline losses -- including the FANG complex\u2019s worst-ever day on Tuesday -- there are data points that suggest that many funds are a long way from abandoning the industry that has added more to the wealth of U.S. stock investors over the past five years than any other. What\u2019s more, the Nasdaq 100 Index is actually the only major U.S. stock benchmark still in the green this quarter.  \u201cThink of things like your thermostat that used to be pretty basic and analogue. Now you can control them with your phone,\u201d said Ognar from his office in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin. \u201cYour coffee machine, your coffee maker -- it\u2019s a huge secular shift that hopefully will continue to put up sustainable growth.\u201d  The stance on Wall Street strikes a discordant note with the backlash building in Washington. While it\u2019s too early to say whether Facebook\u2019s woes will lead to meaningful losses in users and advertisers, the drumbeat for tighter regulation has some wondering if it\u2019s a watershed moment for an industry that promised to change the world for the better.  \u201cYou have the darlings of growth stocks that are going through some tough times, and it\u2019s not going to be a short and quick story,\u201d said Jennifer Ellison, a principal of San Francisco-based Bingham, Osborn & Scarborough, which manages $4.2 billion. \u201cThis is a tip of that iceberg.\u201d  Even Amazon, largely shielded until now, was hammered on Wednesday by talk of a tougher government stance. Axios reported that U.S. President Donald Trump is contemplating ways to \u201cgo after\u201d the e-commerce giant, including whether to wield tax or antitrust legislation. The shares were down 2.1 percent Thursday as of 10:34 a.m. in New York, while the Nasdaq 100 climbed 0.5 percent.  Trump features again when it comes to Apple Inc. shares, which are more than 8 percent off their record high partly on concerns about the prospect of a trade war between the U.S. and China. In a worst-case scenario, the U.S. could impose a tariff that affects iPhones and other Chinese-manufactured electronics. And car accidents have roiled market darlings Tesla Inc. and Nvidia Corp.  Not to worry, say analysts, who\u2019ve flooded email inboxes with reports reaffirming a bullish stance on the broader industry. The bull case? Tech fundamentals remain strong and, for all the worry over privacy, fake news and tech power, the U.S. giants are still cranking out products that people want to buy.  Facebook is sitting on a pile of cash so big that fines equaling the largest corporate penalties ever would amount to less than 7 percent of it. Alongside Google, its online dominance is so complete that there are few alternatives for users or advertisers.  Scarred, Intact  \u201cThey\u2019ll come out bruised and scarred but they\u2019ll come out intact,\u201d said James Cakmak, an analyst at Monness Crespi Hardt & Co. who has maintained his buy rating and $210 price target on Facebook. \u201cRadio and TV aren\u2019t the future, we know that, digital is. And it\u2019s not going to affect the direction of the dollars, which is toward Google and Facebook. The question is what is the speed that they get there.\u201d  The damage to all these stocks over the past couple weeks remains contained if viewed through a wider lens. Even after Tuesday\u2019s 7 percent rout, Nvidia\u2019s stock is double where it was a year ago. Tesla, while losing almost a fifth of its value this year, is still up sevenfold from the start of 2013.  Analyst estimates and fund flows show few signs of panic. In fact, profit forecasts for the tech industry have been barely changed over the past two weeks despite the market turmoil. At 30 percent, the expected pace of growth exceeds all but one industry in the S&P 500 Index.  Investors in ETFs seem in no rush to bail. Take the PowerShares QQQ Trust Series, the biggest fund tracking the Nasdaq 100. Outflows peaked around $2 billion on March 19 and trickled down to less than one-tenth of that amount Tuesday, a day when Nasdaq companies lost $260 billion in market value.  \u201cTech has given us more than it has taken away,\u201d said Kim Forrest, senior portfolio manager at Fort Pitt Capital Group LLC in Pittsburgh. \u201cThe future is going to have more connected devices.\u201d  \u2014 With assistance by Tom Giles", "stock": "NVDA"}, {"url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-20/not-my-problem-tech-stocks-decouple-from-facebook-as-woes-mount", "label": 0, "source": "bloomberg", "date": "2018-03-20", "article": "Facebook added to losses in high-flying tech peers on Monday.

The social media company has lost 12 percent this week, its biggest two-day retreat since 2012, based on closing prices.  News that a company linked to President Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign may have collected data from Facebook users without permission sparked concern that the social media giant -- and potentially its peers -- could face increased regulatory scrutiny. Investors seem to be mostly shrugging off this concern, at least for now. Shares of Facebook have been under pressure for months amid concern over the company\u2019s role in Russian meddling in the 2016 election, even as its peers in the FANG Index of tech megacaps managed to withstand the pressure.  \u201cWhile the last two days were exceedingly harsh, the stock has been losing ground on a relative basis for quite some time,\u201d said Frank Cappelleri, senior equity trader at Instinet LLC. \u201cWhat if Facebook continues to struggle but the rest of the market can shrug it off? That\u2019s just a question to consider.\u201d  A Congressional official familiar with the matter said Facebook tentatively agreed to brief House Judiciary members as early as Wednesday over the use of Facebook users\u2019 personal data by Cambridge Analytica, a firm hired as a consultant to Trump\u2019s campaign. The news helped the Nasdaq 100 Index erase earlier gains and briefly trade in the red. This compares with a 1.1 percent gain in Netflix, a 2.5 percent jump in Nvidia Corp. and a 2 percent rally in Amazon. Twitter Inc., facing its own potential regulatory scrutiny in Israel, fell 9.6% in its worst day since July.  What if tighter regulation spreads to market darlings like Amazon and Netflix? To Michael Purves, chief global strategist at Weeden & Co., it could force investors to rotate out of the group that has grown in strides, partly because of the absence of any regulatory pressure. To London Capital Group\u2019s Jasper Lawler, the potential regulation of tech megacaps will make investors question whether the group, which jumped twice as much as the S&P 500 Index last year, is still a smart purchase.  \u201cThe tech giant\u2019s fast-and-loose handing of private data will feed the niggling doubt investors have had all along that the big U.S. tech stocks cannot keep going up so rapidly forever,\u201d said Jasper Lawler, London Capital Group\u2019s head of research. \u201cLooking further out, legal action and greater industry regulation are huge headwinds \u2018the Zuck\u2019 has to contend with.\u201d  \u2014 With assistance by Stephen Sweeney", "stock": "NVDA"}, {"url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-26/quants-footprint-in-tech-hit-record-just-as-selloff-accelerated", "label": -1, "source": "bloomberg", "date": "2018-03-26", "article": "Among those making heavy bets on technology stocks during the sector\u2019s worst week in nearly eight years were quant funds.

At 18.4 percent, the measure of firms\u2019 long and short positioning was nearly 2 percentage points higher than for February.  Technology Overload Quant funds have boosted tech stock exposure 2 percentage points since start of year Source: Credit Suisse Services Risk Advisory  Quants on the Credit Suisse platform are roughly defined as funds that invest in thousands of equities and trade based on patterns, rather than making stock-specific bets.  It\u2019s mounting evidence that investors following some of the most popular quantitative strategies -- such as momentum investing -- are heavily concentrated in technology. Over the past year, chipmakers Micron Technology Inc. and Nvidia Corp. alone accounted for more than a tenth of gains in the Bloomberg pure U.S. momentum index, which tracks stocks that have gained the most over the past year.  Yet if quant investors had stepped in Wednesday programmed to expect dip-buying, they found no such luck. Following the funds\u2019 peak in technology exposure, the stocks fell about 5 percent to trade at the lowest in more than a month. For the week, global tech shares fell 7.3 percent.  On Monday, the stocks rallied back, with chipmakers among the biggest gainers in the S&P 500 Index.  As for fundamental managers, equity long-short hedge funds tracked by Credit Suisse maintained their elevated technology exposure, at about 22 percent of total holdings. Overall, equity managers appeared largely unmoved by last week\u2019s bout of selling, according to Mark Connors, the head of risk advisory at the Swiss bank.  \u201cStable equity gross and net positioning across most equity managers indicates recent volatility has not prompted unwinds at this point,\u201d Connors wrote in a Friday note. \u201cThe currently odd mix of hedge fund positioning reflects neither concern of further risk-off, nor longer-term optimism regarding global growth.\u201d", "stock": "NVDA"}, {"url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-02/semiconductors-tech-stocks-may-be-at-risk-if-trade-war-broadens", "label": 1, "source": "bloomberg", "date": "2018-03-02", "article": "Investors in technology shares are concerned that the industry could be the next victim of the Trump administration\u2019s increasingly combative stance toward global trade partners.  While Donald Trump\u2019s broadsides this week against what he deemed unfair trade practices focused on industrial metals, comments he made over the past couple of months about the tech industry indicate it could soon come in for targeting as well. In January, Trump said the U.S. was considering a fine on China because it had forced U.S. companies to share their intellectual property as a cost of doing business there. Then in his first State of the Union address, Trump pledged \u201cstrong enforcement\u201d of U.S. rules that protect business secrets.  Those warnings are now sounding more ominous to investors concerned about a trade war between the world\u2019s two biggest economies.  Chris Krueger, an analyst at Cowen Washington Research, notes that semiconductors are one of six \u201ccore industries\u201d in Trump\u2019s America First agenda, along with steel, aluminum, vehicles, aircraft and shipbuilding. He said a U.S. Trade Representative report on forced technology transfers by China may come in a matter of weeks, way before the official Aug. 18 deadline, and could recommend tariffs or bans on Chinese investment or joint ventures.  If Trump does decide to crack down on intellectual property theft, U.S.-based semiconductor companies that have Chinese customers or factories in China could get caught in the crossfire. China is the largest market for the chip industry and if it were to retaliate some U.S. companies may suffer.  \u201cReciprocity on the part of China in IP crackdowns could have a substantial effect on manufacturing and IP of companies,\u201d said Matt Larson, a Bloomberg Intelligence litigation analyst.  One sector high-flier with significant China exposure, Nvidia Corp., had been up 25 percent year-to-date. It sold off as much as 5.7 percent yesterday after Trump made his steel tariff comments, and is dropped as far as 4.5 percent today before recovering. The move over the past two days is worse than the broader market selloff of about 2 percent, reflecting the concern about a Trump tech crackdown.

Quantitative investors have long used liquidity signals to strengthen their automated models. Simply put, bets on the least traded stocks should, in theory, outperform the market because there\u2019s a reward for taking on the extra liquidity risk.  But since December the opposite has been occurring, with the most liquid stocks rewarding investors to the greatest degree in nine years.  In normal times, heavily traded shares don\u2019t overlap much with momentum stocks. Reliable companies carry the market higher without any frenzied buying or selling. Amazon.com Inc., for example, has one of the lowest turnover ratios in the S&P 500 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Yet in a long-short Bloomberg index that bets on the most actively traded stocks, a hefty chipmaker presence has the gauge headed toward its best month since 2009. That semiconductor shares are rising so quickly despite a high turnover is an ominous signal, indicating that trigger-happy, short-term investors are wading into momentum, according to Vitali Kalesnik, head of equity research at Research Affiliates LLC.  Pure Panic  \u201cWhen you see very strong momentum combined with a sharp rise in trading volume, that can serve as a signal of overheating and speculative behavior,\u201d Kalesnik said by phone.\u201cThe issue with speculator money is they can come in and drive prices up and once they see signs of something happening, they quickly leave and drag prices down.\u201d  Nvidia Corp., VMware Inc. and Micron Technology Inc. hold the biggest positions in the Bloomberg trade activity portfolio, and have gained as much as 22 percent in January alone. But the potential for sharp reversals was put on display Wednesday, when semiconductor stocks in the S&P 500 tumbled 2.4 percent, the most in seven weeks, on the heels of a disappointing earnings report from Texas Instruments Inc.  The only other instances of liquid share outperformance occurred when equities began to recover from the bear market lows in 2002 and 2009. But the difference is that in those periods this was a healthy sign because the most beaten up shares had been oversold during the downturn, enabling them to outperform off those lows when the market rebounded, according to Joseph Mezrich, head of U.S. quantitative analysis at Nomura Instinet LLC.

Trump had a few biting tweets out over the weekend, including one lashing out at the EU (\"we will simply apply a Tax on their Cars which freely pour into the U.S.\") and another about the state of America\u2019s steel and aluminum industry (\"Sorry, it\u2019s time for a change!\"). Meanwhile, Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro made it clear that there are no country exemptions to the tariffs, even for U.S. allies like Canada and Great Britain.  Major company-specific news from the weekend include a wrench thrown into Broadcom\u2019s $117 billion bid for Qualcomm (CFIUS issuing an order to delay tomorrow\u2019s vote) and reinsurer M&A with France\u2019s Axa buying XL Group for more than $15 billion, the largest-ever European acquisition of a U.S. insurer.  The market\u2019s focus has shifted quickly from inflation fears, and what the Fed is going to do about it, to the potential for an all-out trade war, and whether the threat from Trump is real or if he is testing the waters to gauge sentiment. The market will be paying close attention over the next few days to retaliatory efforts from the rest of the world, as well as Trump\u2019s next steps: Will he lob more insults at our trade partners? Will he ratchet up the call to exit Nafta (as talks come to a close tomorrow)? Will he clarify or walk the stiff tariff levels back?  Until now, stocks haven\u2019t felt too much of an impact from the recent noise out of D.C., of which there has been plenty over the past week or so. For example, the confusion over what to do about gun control, Lindsay Graham calling for a war with North Korea, Jared Kushner losing top security clearance, Hope Hicks resigning, The Mooch getting banned, and swirling speculation of key point people in the administration taking their leave, from Gary Cohn and H.R. McMaster to John Kelly and Jeff Sessions.  But given the recent shock from the tariff announcement as well as how the calendar is shaping up (we won\u2019t get a major inflationary datapoint until Friday\u2019s jobs & wage hike data), we should expect traders to pay much closer attention to the headlines coming out of the Trump administration in the near term. This is especially true if the rumors get louder about someone like Cohn throwing in the towel.  Scenario #1: Trump Escalates Trade War Fears  Here is what could happen if Trump doesn\u2019t back down on his tariff call (25% on imported steel, 10% on foreign aluminum) and keeps the potential for a trade war very broad by targeting the entire world instead of singling out a country like China:  Steel and aluminum stocks resume their vicious rally from last Thursday, when Trump shockingly introduced the tariffs: CLF surged 10%, AKS +9.5%, CENX +7.5%, X +5.8%, STLD +4%, and so on  NAFTA-exposed names take it further on the chin as the market turns sour on the prospects for a renegotiated pact; this would include the rails (especially KSU and the Canadians like CNI and CP), the autos (GM, FCAU, etc) and the auto parts companies (like MGA and LEA)  Semiconductors with exposure to China (NVDA, MU, AMD, INTC) could come under further pressure given read-across to some of Trump\u2019s past comments on the tech industry and whether he may decide to crack down on alleged intellectual property theft  Watch for rotation into small caps (Russell 2000 clear outperformer in past two sessions) and sectors that are more insulated to a potential trade war like biotechs (IBB ETF up 2.4% on Friday) and the banks  Focus on single-name stocks that have low exposure to a trade war; on Friday, Fundstrat\u2019s Tom Lee put out a bullish buy-the-dip note on equities where he listed 20 stocks that fit the bill given low export as percent of sales and low international sourcing as percent of COGS; included HSY, MSI, and a bunch of energy and healthcare names like EOG, HES, PXD, ALXN, AMGN, BIIB, and GILD  And some will just stick with what has worked, for example NFLX (which rose 5.3% last week to completely shrug off any weakness in FAANG or the SPX) and AMZN (which was flat last week); these two are up 57% and 28% year-to-date, respectively  Scenario #2: Trade War Fears Are Scaled Back  Here\u2019s what might happen if Trump caves in from all of the negativity surrounding the tariff announcement and walks back some of his comments from last week:  We\u2019ll likely see a reversal in some of the actions mentioned above, for example the metal stocks pare some of their tariff-fueled gains while the Nafta names, especially the autos, catch a relief rally  Expect strength in names that got hit late last week on speculation of how the tariffs might crimp margins, for instance heavy machinery like CAT, DE, TEX, MTW and truck machinery like CMI and PCAR Sidenote: Truck machinery names got some good news late Friday night after preliminary Class 8 data for February showed elevated demand (positive for CMI, PCAR, and NAV)  May also see outperformance in HOG, which got caught in the crossfire of potential retaliation from the EU  Tick-by-Tick Guide to Today\u2019s Actionable Events", "stock": "NVDA"}, {"url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-27/asia-stocks-tip-losses-after-u-s-tech-slides-markets-wrap", "label": -1, "source": "bloomberg", "date": "2018-03-28", "article": "Megacap tech shares slumped again Wednesday as pessimism about the sector showed few signs of letting up.

There's no U.S. firm more at risk from trade retaliation.  If there's a poster child for the tonic the current U.S. government has delivered to the country's corporate sector, it's Boeing Co.  Fueled by Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg's cozy relationship with President Donald Trump, orders for Super Hornet fighter jets and corporate tax cuts, its 146 percent share-price increase since election day in 2016 has outpaced every other company on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.    Thursday's 3.5 percent fall after Trump tweeted out plans to impose tariffs on metal imports should be a warning sign that, beyond the current clear skies, a storm is building.  One obvious risk is increased costs. About 80 percent of an aircraft's weight is aluminum, and Trump's promise to slap levies of 10 percent on imports of that metal represents a pricing handicap in Muilenburg's endless battle for market share with Airbus SE.  Flying High Boeing has put in by far the best share-price performance of any company on the Dow since Trump's election Source: Bloomberg  At the same time, that blow is likely to be cushioned by the fact that managing raw-materials costs is part and parcel of being a manufacturer. Aluminum prices have risen or fallen by 10 percent or more in all but eight of the past 30 years. Boeing, moreover, isn't a major buyer of aluminum straight from the pot: Most of its supply comes from Arconic Inc., the specialty-products half of the old Alcoa Corp. business. Shares of Arconic slipped 1.5 percent on Thursday, an indication it's expected to take part of the hit.  The bigger risk depends on how the coming days and months are handled.  There's probably no U.S. firm more at risk of trade retaliation from China than Boeing. Of the 10 American businesses that declare more than $5 billion of sales in the country, three -- Apple Inc., Las Vegas Sands Corp. and Procter & Gamble Co. -- are dependent on consumer spending, so probably somewhat immune to government diktats. Six more are in the semiconductor and tech businesses that China wants to encourage domestically, so they should also enjoy a degree of protection. Against that backdrop, Boeing stands out like a sore thumb.  Odd One Out Boeing is the only non-consumer, non-tech U.S. company that declares more than $5 billion in revenue from China Source: Bloomberg  Most of its biggest customers in China are state-owned airlines and lessors affiliated with government-controlled banks. The few independent players could easily be leaned on by authorities to defer existing orders.  China Inc. has a sound self-interested rationale for pursuing an aggressive path. Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China Ltd., or Comac, is hoping to pitch its C919 jet as a home-grown competitor to Boeing's 737 and Airbus's A320, and announced last month it would make its first delivery in 2021.

The company, which specializes in systems that analyze faces and images on an enormous scale, said it closed a Series C round in recent months in which Singaporean state investment firm Temasek Holdings Pte and retailer Suning.com Co. also participated. SenseTime didn\u2019t outline individual investments, but Alibaba was said to have sought the biggest stake in the three-year-old startup.  With the deal, SenseTime has doubled its valuation in a few months. Backed by Qualcomm Inc., it underscores its status as one of a crop of homegrown firms spearheading Beijing\u2019s ambition to become the leader in AI by 2030. And it\u2019s a contributor to the world\u2019s biggest system of surveillance: if you\u2019ve ever been photographed with a Chinese-made phone or walked the streets of a Chinese city, chances are your face has been digitally crunched by SenseTime software built into more than 100 million mobile devices.  The latest financing will bankroll investments in parallel fields such as autonomous driving and augmented reality, cover the growing cost of AI talent and shore up its computing power. It\u2019s developing a service code-named \u201cViper\u201d to parse data from thousands of live camera feeds -- a platform it hopes will prove invaluable in mass surveillance. And it\u2019s already in talks to raise another round of funds and targeting a valuation of more than $4.5 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.  \u201cWe\u2019re going to explore several new strategic directions and that\u2019s why we shall spend more money on building infrastructure,\u201d SenseTime co-founder Xu Li said in an interview. The company turned profitable in 2017 and wants to grow its workforce by a third to 2,000 by the end of this year. \u201cFor the past three years the average revenue growth has been 400 percent.\u201d  Read more: China\u2019s Plan for World Domination in AI Isn\u2019t So Crazy After All  AI Supremacy China houses some of the world's largest privately backed artificial intelligence startups Source: CB Insights, Bloomberg  Alibaba, the e-commerce giant that\u2019s also the country\u2019s biggest cloud service provider, could help with its enormous infrastructure needs. SenseTime plans to build at least five supercomputers in top-tier cities over the coming year to drive Viper and other services. As envisioned, it streams thousands of live feeds into a single system that\u2019re automatically processed and tagged, via devices from office face-scanners to ATMs and traffic cameras (so long as the resolution is high enough). The ultimate goal is to juggle 100,000 feeds simultaneously.  Police can use Viper to track everything from vice and accidents to suspects on blacklists. While civil libertarians say such systems have been used to track activists and oppress minorities in places like the Western region of Xinjiang, Xu believes the technology is essential and deployed in various ways by authorities around the world. China\u2019s police forces and surveillance footage are also important sources of training data for SenseTime\u2019s image recognition systems -- it claims to work with 40 city authorities in the country.  \u201cIt will not affect privacy because only authorized persons can access it,\u201d he said.  SenseTime claims some 400 clients and partners including Qualcomm, chipmaker Nvidia Corp. and smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp. For 2018, it\u2019s projecting several billion yuan in revenues, Xu said. The startup\u2019s expanding its reach across augmented reality, popularized by services like Snapchat that impose digital stickers and images on the real world. And it\u2019s working with Honda Motor Co. to develop autonomous driving systems and is in talks to work with health institutions.  \u201cIn China there is an advantage in areas like facial recognition because of the privacy that exists in the U.S. and elsewhere in the EU, and some of the very best facial recognition technology in the world that I\u2019ve seen is in China,\u201d said Breyer Capital founder Jim Breyer, an indirect investor in SenseTime through IDG.  SenseTime is the largest, according to CB Insights, of a plethora of private AI outfits. Fellow facial-recognition startup Megvii Inc. raised $460 million last year, while smaller niche players from Yitu to Malong Technologies have also won funding. A key partner, Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology, is one of the world\u2019s biggest suppliers of security cameras and developing its own competing AI technology.  Xu says its ability to work across wide datasets and diverse products sets it apart from rivals. \u201cWhat is difficult is if you\u2019re dealing with different video streams in different formats,\u201d he said. While the company has long considered an initial public offering, Xu said those plans are on hold pending rules that facilitate tech listings in mainland China.  \u201cWe are still waiting for a fixed rule to come up with a new strategy,\u201d he said. \u201cProbably not this year.\u201d  \u2014 With assistance by David Ramli", "stock": "NVDA"}, {"url": "http://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/nvidia-earnings-fourth-quarter-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-questions-2017-1015147222", "label": -1, "source": "business-insider", "date": "2018-02-08", "article": "REUTERS/Steve Marcus  Nvidia's stock is rising after reporting an across the board beat on earnings.

In 2018, stock has posted a 16.74% gain, which Citron thinks is too much.  \"Is Nvidia really worth $36 billion more than it was New Years Eve with $15k BTC?\" Citron asked on Twitter. Nvidia has gotten a boost from cryptocurrency miners buying huge numbers of graphics cards to speed up their rigs, especially as the price of bitcoin hit its high of nearly $20,000 in December. Prices have come crashing down to just under $9,000, which could mean demand from miners could wane.  Citron and Goldman both fear the boost Nvidia has seen from cryptocurrency mining is unsustainable and unreliable as a way to grow sales. Goldman said it could lead to volatile earnings as Wall Street struggles to find concrete ways to predict the demand of the crypto market.  For context, during its recent earnings call, AMD's leadership said crypto mining added about $300 million in revenue, or about 5-6%, in 2017. Nvidia is set to report its earnings, and its boost from crypto mining, on February 8.  Crypto isn't the only worry for Nvidia, though.  The company's data center business was just starting when Goldman added the stock to its conviction list in late 2016. Since then, it's exploded as artificial intelligence and cloud computing have become the hottest new trend in enterprise computing. The sector is now better understood, which means more players are starting to nip at the heels of Nvidia's dominance, according to Citron.  Citron said that Nvidia used to be the only player in AI and autonomous driving computing, but is facing stiff competition in both categories going into 2018.

Pause, just take a pause.\u201d  Others running self-driving test programs on public roads, including Toyota Research Institute, have also paused, but some, including Waymo and Intel, have instead publicly declared that their own systems wouldn\u2019t have failed where Uber\u2019s did in this instance, and have continued their own testing programs on public roads.", "stock": "NVDA"}, {"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/01/16/chinas-chery-will-use-nvidia-powered-zf-proai-for-level-3-autonomous-cars/", "label": 0, "source": "techcrunch", "date": "2018-01-16", "article": "Chinese automaker Chery will be building cars with Level 3 autonomous features powered by supplier ZF\u2019s ProAI platform, which itself uses Nvidia GPUs for its driving intelligence.

Even if Nintendo issues a software update, this software update won\u2019t affect the boot ROM. And as the console loads the boot ROM immediately after pressing the power button, there\u2019s no way to bypass it.  The only way to fix it would be to manufacture new Nvidia Tegra X1 chips.

One main focus will be to work with charities, non-governmental organizations and others on \u201cAI for good,\u201d alongside Element AI\u2019s existing work in finance, cybersecurity, manufacturing, logistics and robotics.  The idea is smart and timely: at a moment when many might see the advances of AI as potentially more dystopian and encroaching than beneficial \u2014 not to mention reserved for the select few who have the financial and human resources to build AI systems \u2014 Element AI wants to position itself, and AI, as something that can be used to help everyone.  \u201cThere are so many exciting people in the world of academia and artificial intelligence wanting to do interesting stuff. How can we make sure our tools are not just meeting the needs of big companies? There are others who could also use them,\u201d Dr Julien Cornebise, who will be leading Element AI\u2019s offices in London, said in an interview.  Notably for a startup that is looking to take on the likes of Google in a bid to \u201cdemocratize\u201d the intellectual and operational capital needed to build out innovative products based on AI, Cornebise himself comes to Element AI from DeepMind, the UK startup Google acquired back in 2014 that now plays a central role in the company\u2019s AI efforts.  He had been one of the first employees at DeepMind, and since leaving in 2016 \u2014 in search of, he tells TechCrunch, an environment that felt more like a smaller startup again \u2014 he\u2019s been working pro bono at Amnesty International.  He wouldn\u2019t get too specific about what he\u2019s been doing at the human rights organization, except to say that it involved work in \u201cconflict resolution\u201d and working out a way to build algorithms that could help identify bad practices on a larger scale than the organisation could do with limited human resources. (It sounds like the aim is to launch this service later this year.)  While the Amnesty work has pre-dated Element AI coming to London, the idea, he said, would be to use it as a template for how the startup hopes to collaborate with groups.  \u201cI want to be super careful here because I\u2019ve seen too many enthusiastic machine learning people say, \u2018Stand back! We are going to save the world!'\u201d Cornebise said (a comment you can imagine might apply just as easily to a more controversial project at DeepMind as it might to the best/misguided intentions of Facebook\u2019s algorithms). \u201cWe\u2019ve actually got the easy part. There are people who are going to jail for doing their jobs. I want now to say, \u2018How can we help?'\u201d  The startup\u2019s move to London underscores how the UK has put itself on the map when it comes to AI research and applications, with universities like Oxford, Cambridge, Imperial College and others all breaking ground and producing leading thinkers and startups in areas like computer vision, deep learning and robotics.  \u201cElement AI\u2019s establishment of a London office is testament to the strengths of the UK research and innovation ecosystem in AI, and the potential for industrial collaborations with our businesses,\u201dnoted Matt Sansam, Innovation Lead for Digital at Innovate UK, in a statement.  Element AI\u2019s plan is to hire about 20 engineers and developers to start off, based in London. But it also wants to start building out a bigger global network. This second wave of people might be start out initially in London and Montreal (where the company is based), before returning to more spread-out locations to expand work and intellectual capital elsewhere, potentially counteracting the ongoing issue of \u201cbrain drain\u201d where the brightest people often leave to migrate to where the jobs and money are.  \u201cWhy would it be someone in London who is trying to solve a problem in Burundi, for example?\u201d Cornebise says. \u201cThere are tons of minds who we just don\u2019t see from here because they are not part of the academic fabric.\u201d  Element AI itself has raised at least $102 million in funding to date (there was also an undisclosed Seed round in addition to the large Series A). The Series A was led by Data Collective, with Microsoft, Intel, Nvidia and others participating.  Cornebise and a spokesperson for Element AI only smiled, but would not comment, when I asked if the startup would be raising more money to help finance this new aspect of the business and its London expansion.

Most of the slide came after news reports showing how the company\u2019s data was misused. Investors have to grapple with the possibility that Facebook won\u2019t be sharing as much data as it does, undermining its ability to generate ever-increasing amounts of advertising revenue.  Nvidia, a computer chip maker intent on being a leader in automated driving technology, is off 12 percent from its recent high. The company said on Tuesday that it would halt tests of its autonomous driving technology on public roads after an Uber self-driving car hit and killed a pedestrian in Arizona.  Tesla is not a tech stock, but it is included in the FANG+ index, and its supporters believe deeply in its power to revolutionize the auto industry. Growing fears about Tesla\u2019s ability to finance its expansion have helped drag its stock down 33 percent from its recent high. Ominously, the price of Tesla\u2019s bonds is also falling, signaling that the company is losing the confidence of creditors.  Of course, on their march higher, tech stocks overcame obstacles, like management problems at Uber and the poor performance of Snap\u2019s initial public offering.  But the latest problems have raised deeper, broader doubts, and that may keep the uncertainty around longer. Investors have viewed automated driving technology as a huge potential source of growth for some companies. But after the Uber incident in Arizona, those companies may take a more realistic look at what they have to spend to create a technology that is efficient and safe, and conclude that they have to pull out of the race or pare back. Users of social media and regulators may prevent social media companies from sharing so much of their data with advertisers, and that could restrain revenue growth.

GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives writes:  \u201cWhile it\u2019s now a hand holding time for Amazon given this new regulatory potential threat, we believe the reality of these worries altering the company\u2019s business model and future tax structure are low and we would be buyers of the name on weakness.\u201d  Guess which companies are benefiting from Amazon's woes?

The electric carmaker\u2019s shares are down 7 percent Wednesday, after plunging 8 percent on Tuesday.  Tuesday\u2019s slide was driven, in part, by the National Transportation Safety Board\u2019s announcement that it was investigating a fatal crash last week involving a Tesla vehicle in California. News that Jaguar Land Rover was teaming up with Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Waymo unit probably didn't help either.  But the continued decline in Tesla\u2019s stock \u2014 its shares are down more than 20 percent since mid-March \u2014 speaks to the bigger concern surrounding Tesla: How it funds itself.  Investors have grown increasingly worried as Tesla burns through cash and struggles to meet its own production goals for the Model 3. Late Tuesday, Moody\u2019s downgraded Tesla\u2019s credit rating further into junk territory and said its outlook on the company is negative. The credit ratings agency cited production delays and said Tesla may soon need to raise more than $2 billion.  Those concerns can be seen not just in Tesla\u2019s stock price but also in the trading of its debt. The FT points out that \u201cTesla\u2019s eight-year bond maturing in 2025 traded on Wednesday at 87.6 cents to the dollar, the lowest since issuance. The yield has surged to 7.5 percent from 6.59 percent on Monday.\u201d  Liam Denning of Bloomberg Gadfly writes:  \u201cChallenges on the factory floor and the balance sheet are converging.

Nvidia is asking retailers to sell a maximum of two graphics cards (of the same model) per person, in an effort to cut back on bulk orders from virtual currency miners.  Nvidia also issued a statement stressing that it\u2019s behind gamers when it comes to the current GPU stock and pricing problems. In a comment to German tech site ComputerBase, the company said: \u201cFor Nvidia, gamers come first. All activities related to our GeForce product line are targeted at our main audience.  \u201cTo ensure that GeForce gamers continue to have good GeForce graphics card availability in the current situation, we recommend that our trading partners make the appropriate arrangements to meet gamers\u2019 needs as usual.\u201d  Of course, the two-card purchasing rule is just a suggested limitation, and it\u2019s up to retailers to actually enforce it, with no comeback if they don\u2019t. And realistically, many retailers aren\u2019t likely to care exactly who is buying their products \u2013 or particularly want to go to the effort of policing orders \u2013 as long as cash is going into the till.  So it\u2019s certainly arguable how much tangible impact this move will make.  Still, it\u2019s something, and in some ways, this is more about Nvidia letting gamers know that it hasn\u2019t forgotten about them, and that is realizes the gravity of the situation, as graphics cards prices are starting to get silly thanks to the excessive demand.  Double money  For example, the GeForce GTX 1070 is the card many gamers would want to get, but looking on Newegg at the time of writing in the US, the cheapest model is $889 \u2013 and on the UK site, it\u2019s \u00a3707. Remember, this is supposed to be a card with a recommended price of around $380 or \u00a3380, so you\u2019re basically paying double right now.  That isn\u2019t necessarily true across the entire spectrum of GPUs, but price pressure is clearly getting ridiculous, and some models are completely out of stock at some retailers. Even a supposedly wallet-friendly GTX 1060 will now set you back around $330 or \u00a3240 on Newegg.  It\u2019s a miserable situation which means that those looking to upgrade their graphics card, or those building a new PC and looking for a GPU to go inside, are pretty much throwing their hands up in despair.  Of course, the mining craze is currently being fuelled by the recent major boom in cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin leading the (volatile) charge. Although mining the latter is now dominated by dedicated ASIC devices, other virtual currencies have shot up in its wake, and the likes of Ethereum can still be effectively mined using PCs sporting multiple graphics cards.  There\u2019s been plenty of discussion around this topic across the net, as you can imagine, with many not understanding why Nvidia and AMD can\u2019t simply produce more GPUs to meet demand \u2013 but there are obviously production issues to consider. Ramping up the assembly lines isn\u2019t just a matter of flipping a switch.  Perhaps the real solution will be the production of more mining-dedicated graphics cards \u2013 with no video output ports \u2013 specifically targeting the cryptocurrency market. Fingers crossed that everything settles down sooner rather than later, but we\u2019re not particularly optimistic about that right now.

TweakTown reports, citing an anonymous source, that the company will officially name its next set of graphics cards the \u2018GTX 11 Series.\u2019  Widely expected to be based on the in-progress Nvidia Turing hardware architecture, this naming convention would be a step to the left of what the technology world has anticipated the company to go with.  Reports and rumors leading up to this had pegged the next generation of Nvidia graphics cards to be known as the GTX 20 series.  Leaving room for further specialization?  Furthermore, TweakTown\u2019s source reportedly said of the new product line that \"it [the new cards] won't necessarily end in '70' and '80' like we're used to.\u201d  This could see Nvidia applying different numerals to its product names from what it currently does, which starts at 50 (e.g. Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050) up through 80. TweakTown speculates that Nvidia could denote its products in increments of five (i.e. GTX 1185).  However, and this is speculation of our own, it\u2019s possible that Nvidia simply wishes not to constrict itself within its own naming convention, leaving room for products closer in numeral so as to be geared toward specific, niche use cases \u2013 or to broaden the GTX name\u2019s scope.  For instance, the successor to the Nvidia MX150 could be the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1140 and so forth, allowing Nvidia to introduce the GTX name to even lower-spec products.

That hasn't been the case in recent years, however, as games focus less on pumping in more polygons and instead make small-but-meaningful upgrades with things like texture quality, resolution, lighting, and visual effects work.  Ray tracing looks to be another one of those seemingly modest, but potentially significant upgrades that will hit the gaming landscape in the near future.  What is ray tracing you might ask? It's a much more advanced and lifelike way of rendering light and shadows in a scene. It's what movies and TV shows use to create and blend in amazing CG work with real-life scenes. The drawback is ray tracing often requires extensive server farms to pre-render graphics. That's been too much to ask from a real-time, interactive video game running on a compact box in your home.  Well, at least until now. At the Game Developers Conference, Nvidia, Microsoft, and AMD announced initiatives that will finally make ray tracing possible in real-time games, which means dazzling effects and much more immersive game worlds. Here's a look at what to expect, who's involved in this new push, and what they're bringing to the table.  What is ray tracing?  Ray tracing is a rendering technique that can produce incredibly realistic lighting effects. Essentially, an algorithm can trace the path of light, and then simulate the way that the light interacts with the virtual objects it ultimately hits in the computer-generated world.  We've seen in-game lighting effects become more and more realistic over the years, but the benefits of ray tracing are less about the light itself and more about how it interacts with the world.  Ray tracing allows for dramatically more lifelike shadows and reflections, along with much-improved translucence and scattering. The algorithm takes into account where the light hits and calculates the interaction and interplay much like the human eye would process real light, shadows, and reflections, for example. The way light hits objects in the world also affects which colors you see.  With enough computational power available, it's possible to produce incredibly realistic CG images that are nearly indistinguishable from life. But that's the problem: even a well-equipped gaming PC only has so much GPU power to work with, let alone a modern game console.  Ray tracing is used extensively when developing computer graphics imagery for films and TV shows, but that's because studios can harness the power of an entire server farm (or cloud computing) to get the job done. And even then, it can be a long, laborious process. Doing it on the fly has been far too taxing for existing gaming hardware.  Instead, video games use rasterization, which is a much speedier way to render computer graphics. It converts the 3D graphics into 2D pixels to display on your screen, but rasterization then requires shaders to depict reasonably lifelike lighting effects.  The results just don't look quite as natural or realistic as they would with ray tracing. The benefits of this technology probably won't seem individually mind-blowing, but the collective enhancements could really elevate the realism of interactive game worlds.  Who is working on ray tracing?  Microsoft is the biggest fish in this new video game ray tracing pond, as the company announced DirectX Raytracing (DXR) in the DirectX 12 API. They've created the structure for introducing and computing rays in the world, and have made it possible for developers to begin experimenting with the technology to see what's possible in their game engines.  And they're not alone: Microsoft has been working with several of the world's biggest game makers and game engine creators to help introduce ray tracing into PC games. Electronic Arts' Frostbite and SEED engines will be compatible, along with the ubiquitous Unreal Engine and Unity engine seen throughout the industry.  Creators can get started right away, too, thanks to an experimental DXR SDK available now. Microsoft will share further insight at GDC 2018 this week.  Bringing ray tracing to life in games requires incredible GPU power, so unsurprisingly, Nvidia is also leading the charge. The company's RTX technology leverages a decade of work on graphics algorithms and GPUs, and they're working closely with Microsoft's DXR API to get developers up to speed quickly.  According to Nvidia, \"film-quality algorithms\" and updates to their GameWorks API will deliver lighting, reflections, shadows, and related effects with a previously-unseen level of fidelity. And Nvidia's incoming Volta-class GPUs will be compatible, of course.  And AMD won't be left behind, either. They haven't shared as much as Nvidia yet as of this writing, but they have announced \"real-time ray tracing\" capabilities via their ProRender rendering engine and Radeon GPU Profiler 1.2. However, AMD's announcement seems less focused on games at this point, and more about improving developers' workflows and results with a blend of ray tracing and rasterization.  When will we see the benefits?  While AMD's approach doesn't seem targeted towards games just yet, that same sort of mixed approach is probably what we'll see in the gaming world to start. As Microsoft's official blog post suggested, DirectX Raytracing will \"supplement current rendering techniques.\"  In other words, it'll make some improvements over rasterization, but not fully replace it. Even tomorrow's GPUs probably aren't fully up to that task. But ray tracing will be another tool in game developers' toolkits, and one that will become more and more important over time.  Microsoft suggests that ray tracing will gain more focus \"over the next several years\" for things that rasterization just doesn't excel in, including global illumination. \"Eventually, ray tracing may completely replace rasterization as the standard algorithm for rendering 3D scenes,\" the post concludes.  That's a far-off possibility, but these are important steps in the right direction. Nvidia's new tech demos show that companies like Remedy Entertainment (Quantum Break) and Epic Games (Fortnite) are already learning the ins and outs of ray tracing and delivering dazzling results.  It seems possible that we'll see ray tracing start to roll out in games running on high-end GPUs (like Nvidia's Volta series) in the near future, perhaps later in 2018. Nothing is concrete yet, however.  For now, though, it's exciting to think that this long-awaited ability is finally on the horizon \u2013 and it will only help bridge the gap in graphical fidelity between interactive worlds and the kind of incredible CGI work seen on the big screen.

With most of the best gaming moments being shared on Gfycat or as just plain GIFs, it was inevitable that Nvidia GeForce would be able to let you create some of your own. Nvidia has added the ability for everyone to export their Highlights as GIFs just as they could have previously shot short videos.  Highlights, of course, is a ShadowPlay feature the GPU maker introduced in August 2017 that automatically captures gamers\u2019 greatest moments.  Up until now users have only been able to share these moments as images or videos. Pictures are easy to share but might only capture a single snapshot of a greater story, meanwhile, uploading video requires a YouTube account or another client. Being able to save and share moments as a GIF splits the difference between both as modestly sized segments everyone can share easily.  Gamers will be able to create Highlights from even more games now that Call of Duty WWII, Tekken, Dying Light: Bad Blood and Escape from Tarkov have all joined the roster. Nvidia also released the first public SDK for Highlights along with support for the Unreal and Unity engines, so we\u2019ll likely see an explosion of supported titles later this year.

Apple has detailed how the feature works through a support page on its website, noting that this function only works with Macs that support Thunderbolt 3 connectivity. So, that means MacBook Pro models released since 2016, iMac models since 2017 and the brand new iMac Pro.  Of course, you\u2019ll also need this update installed, which is available through the Mac App Store.  Having an external graphics card, or eGPU, connected to your allows for far more functionality than just improved graphics brunt, however.

Nvidia is a no-show  Sadly, the list of supported graphics cards is rather small, and even at that the list of graphics card enclosures that support each model is even smaller.

Virtual testing  At the same time it's announcing the cessation of real-world testing, Nvidia also unveiled a new system for testing self-driving cars, one that takes place in virtual rather than real-world environments.  Nvidia DRIVE Constellation is a cloud-based computing platform that will test driving scenarios using photo-realistic simulations.  The system runs on two servers. The first server powers the Nvidia DRIVE Sim, a software set that emulates a self-driving car's various sensors, including its cameras, lidar and radar.  The second server houses the Nvidia DRIVE Pegasus AI, which will process the gathered data as if it's coming from sensors in a self-driving car on the road.  The testing may be taking place in a virtual environment, but it's happening on the same hardware and software that would be found in a self-driving car, Nvidia's Danny Shapiro explained in a briefing.  The simulator is constantly validating information coming from the DRIVE Pegasus AI, while the DRIVE Sim can create virtual driving scenarios ranging from rain to glare to limited night vision.  Nvidia says that in addition to being a safer way to test the technology for self-driving cars, the DRIVE Constellation also allows for faster testing; collecting data from billions of miles on virtual roads and innumerable scenarios in much less time than self-driving cars could gather on the road.  It's not yet clear to what degree Nvidia will rely on virtual testing versus real-world testing once its public driving tests resume.  New solution?  Nvidia's announcements come at a pivotal time for the self-driving car industry.  Less than 10 days ago, an Uber self-driving car struck and killed a pedestrian who was walking outside of a crosswalk in Tempe, Arizona. The car was in autonomous mode when it struck the victim, and it is the first known pedestrian death involving a self-driving car.  Following the accident, Uber suspended all self-driving car tests in North America. Earlier today, Arizona Governor Doug Ducey suspended Uber's ability to test and operate self-driving cars on public roads in the state.  The accident has called into the question the safety of testing self-driving cars on public roads.  It remains to be seen how effective Nvidia DRIVE Constellation is at putting self-driving cars through the paces and how that testing translates into the real world.  Testing may not involve putting self-driving cars on public streets, with all the safety issues that entails, but virtual environments aren't real ones, no matter how authentic the simulations seem.", "stock": "NVDA"}, {"url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/nvidia-next-gen-graphics-cards-to-use-gddr6-video-memory-says-report", "label": -1, "source": "techradar", "date": "2018-03-30", "article": "The Nvidia GPU Technology Conference might have come and gone without any mention of next generation graphics cards, but one memory supplier has confirmed it will utilize GDDR6 video memory.

Now it seems the company is ready to break its silence for a second go with the Samsung Odyssey Z 15.  Samsung\u2019s Odyssey Z 15 is a new, thin-and-light 15-inch gaming laptop featuring Intel\u2019s new hexa-core Coffee Lake processors and a Nvidia GTX 1060 graphics chip. On top of that, the laptop features a bold new styling and dynamic cooling system.  Image 1 of 8 Image 2 of 8 Image 3 of 8 Image 4 of 8 Image 5 of 8 Image 6 of 8 Image 7 of 8 Image 8 of 8  Design  Samsung\u2019s first gaming laptops raised eyebrows with some interesting and questionable design elements, but the Odyssey Z 15 just looks plain gorgeous.  Looking at the laptop\u2019s screen lid alone, the thick fullers (or troughs) etched into the metal give the laptop a unique and beautiful identity. Though it might seem like the top of the notebook has a ridged surface, it\u2019s actually an illusion of the brushed aluminum finish on the flat metal.  Open the laptop, and you\u2019re greeted with an equally unorthodox form factor with its keyboard moved towards the bottom edge of the machine and a touchpad sitting off the lower right hand side. As with other similar gaming laptops, like the Asus ROG Zephyrus GX501 and Acer Predator Triton 700 , Samsung opted for this design to accommodate cooling for high-end hardware.  What\u2019s more, this form factor allows the laptop to remain at a relatively small 14.78 x 10.03 x 0.71 inch (37.5 x 24.5 x 13.5; W x D x H) size and 5.3 pound weight (2.4kg).  As with our past experience with other similar laptops, getting used to the Odyssey Z 15\u2019s right-handed trackpad takes some getting used to. But, with time, you might find the desktop arrangement of the pointing device even better than its usual place on notebooks. Thankfully, the keyboard on this 15-inch machine is also a joy, as it offers plenty of travel and \u2018crater\u2019 (i.e. concave) keycaps for a comfortable typing experience.  The Samsung Odyssey Z 15 also features some unique keys positioned above the trackpad to start and stop gameplay recordings on the fly.  Specifications  Looks aside, the Samsung Odyssey Z 15 is shaping up to be the brand\u2019s most powerful gaming laptop yet. At the heart of this machine will be an 8th generation Intel Core i7 processor with six-cores and 12-threads.  Alongside that, Samsung has integrated a Nvidia GTX 1060 graphics chip, which will promises to always deliver high-resolution graphics.  To keep the system running cool, Samsung has introduced a Z AeroFlow Cooling System. The set up includes a Dynamic Spread Vapor Chamber, the Z AeroFlow Cooling Design and the Z Blade Blower. In this arrangement, the laptop\u2019s two fans push cool air though the system to remove heat from the CPU and GPU at the same time while expelling hot air.  During off load times or regular use, there\u2019s a silent operation mode that promises to keep fan noise to a low 22 decibels.  Rounding out the Samsung Odyssey Z 15\u2019s configuration is a 1TB solid-state drive and 16GB of DDR4 RAM. There unfortunately isn\u2019t any mention of pricing and, for the time being, the laptop will only be available in China and Korea. A Samsung spokesperson told us we can expect the gaming notebook to arrive stateside in the latter third of the year.  Early verdict  The Odyssey Z 15 looks like Samsung\u2019s most promising gaming laptop yet. With the looks of a luxury device and performance of a muscle book, this gaming laptop is looking like it will push the boundaries of what a thin-and-light machine can do.  While it might seem wholly dedicated to the pursuit of gaming with dedicated streaming keys, Samsung is also keeping every day use in mind with the inclusion of a silent operation mode. The Samsung Odyssey Z 15 is still a ways from its US release, but we can\u2019t wait to get some more time with it and will surely go into a full review with the gaming laptop then.", "stock": "NVDA"}, {"url": "http://www.techradar.com/news/the-hottest-pc-gaming-gear-to-look-forward-to-in-2018", "label": 1, "source": "techradar", "date": "2018-01-19", "article": "The only thing better than the Ultra HD graphics and silky-smooth gameplay that PC gaming affords is all the cool gear surrounding your computer. From keyboards to mice, monitors, gaming chairs and headsets, PC gaming hardware goes much farther than your main rig.  While we\u2019re all still lusting after that ultra-wide gaming monitor or fancy keyboard, there are always new products to pine after. This year at CES 2018 , we got our first glimpse of some of the most desirable pieces of gaming gear we\u2019ve seen yet.  Asus Bezel-Free Kit  Multi-monitor setups for PC gaming can be amazing, especially for flight simulators and racing games but the only thing that sucks is seeing gaps between each of your screens. Asus\u2019 Bezel-Free monitor kit aims to eliminate the problem by optically merging two or more screens into a seamless picture.  Because it only uses prisms and the magic of light refraction, they can be slipped between practically any monitors with thin bezels and require no electronic control or power to work. If you\u2019re already using a dual or triple monitor setup, this is the easiest way to DIY an ultra-wide screen rather than outright buying a whole new display.  Expected: Late 2018  HP Omen X 65 BFGD  Nvidia Big Format Gaming Displays made a huge splash at CES 2018, and we came away most impressed by the HP version: the Omen X 65 BFGD . Just looking at specifications that include a 65-inch panel, 4K resolution, HDR compliancy, a 120Hz refresh rate and 1 millisecond response rate, it\u2019s hard not to be wowed. This truly is the ultimate display for PC gaming.  Expected: Fall 2018  Nvidia GeForce Now for PC beta  While this might not be a physical bit of kit, Nvidia GeForce Now coming to PC is something everyone will love. This gaming streaming service turns every Windows laptop, desktop and tablet into a gaming PC \u2013 whether it be a lowly netbook or a top of the line Ultrabook, almost anyone can access Nvidia\u2019s extensive online PC game library.  Expected: Available now  Corsair Dark Core RGB SE & MM1000 Qi  We\u2019ve seen a plenty of wireless mice and even a few wireless charging mice, but the Dark Core RGB SE is the first Qi-charging gaming mouse in the world. When paired with Corsair\u2019s new MM1000 Qi wireless charging mouse pad, you can practically run the Dark Core RGB SE forever. As a bonus, the whole wireless charging setup is fully compatible with Qi-charging phones, including the latest iPhone X and Samsung Galaxy Note 8 .  Expected: Available now  Cooler Master MasterKeys MK851  The Cooler Master MasterKeys MK851 might just look like another RGB backlit mechanical keyboard, but it comes with the unique feature of analog keys. Modern keyboards are fully digital inputs, but on its latest product, Cooler Master has included eight analog keys around and including the WASD keys.  These analog switches allow you to lightly press keys to move characters around more slowly. Alternatively, they could act like physical pedals for racing games and many more precise controls we\u2019ve yet to even imagine.  Expected: Mid 2018  Zotac AMP Box  We\u2019ve seen prototypes of Zotac external GPU box for well over a year now, so it was exciting to finally see it in its final form at CES 2018. Unlike the Razer Core and Asus ROG Station 2, the Zotac AMP Box is quite a bit smaller and designed for only mini GPUs. That said, this is one of the finest GPU boxes built completely out of aluminum while also featuring a fully customizable RGB lighting setup.  Expected: Early 2018  Razer Nommo Pro  Computer speakers are often overlooked for a PC gaming setup, but Razer\u2019s new Razer Nommo Pro delivers an incredible audio bang that headphones could never muster. The 2.1 THX certified speaker system features a Dupont Kevlar coated driver that projects solid mids, while silk-woven tweeters produce smooth and balanced highs.  Meanwhile, a cylindrical downward-firing subwoofer is designed to generate airflow for consistent, deep tones. Put all together, it\u2019s one of the fullest-sounding and loudest PC gaming speaker systems we\u2019ve ever heard.  Expected: Early 2018  Vertagear PL4500 RGB Gaming Chair  We never thought it would be possible, but Vertagear has integrated RGB lighting into a gaming chair. The PL4500 RGB comes with lighting built into the harness through-holes and underneath its base for an underglow effect. The whole thing is powered by batteries \u2013 that Vertagear claims can power its RGB gaming chair for 30 hours \u2013 and it can even wirelessly sync effects and colors to your PC through NZXT CAM. It\u2019s the perfect piece of furniture to complement your RGB lit PC, keyboard, mouse, mousepad and room lighting.  Expected: Spring 2018  SteelSeries Rival 600  The SteelSeries Rival 600 is one of the first dual-sensor gaming mice we\u2019ve seen. Going with two sensors not only makes it more accurate, it also reduces sensor drifting when you lift off with your mouse. This gaming mouse also comes with eight 4g weights, allowing users to increase its weight from 96g all the way to 128g.  Expected: Available now  MSI Optix MPG27CQ  We\u2019ve seen RGB lighting come to gaming monitors before, but the MSI Optix MPG27CQ might be the first display to actually put it to good use. Rather than putting the lights behind the screen or give monitors an underglow effect, they\u2019re right below the panel. This way users can set lights to signal ability cooldowns and other in-game timers or Discord chat notifications. We\u2019ve seen the same sort of utility come to keyboards, but it makes much more sense to get this information on a monitor you\u2019re already staring at.

According to some digging done by NotebookCheck, these two variants are differentiated by their device ID of \u201810DE 1D10\u2019 and \u201810DE 1D12\u2019, the former of which is the standard (full-speed) GPU, and the latter runs with lesser clock speeds and a lower power draw.  NotebookCheck posted an example GPU-Z (a graphics diagnostics and benchmark tool) screenshot of a standard 1D10 version of the MX150 running in an Asus ZenBook UX430UN with a clock speed of 1,469MHz and boost to 1,532MHz.  Then, the report shows a shot of the 1D12 flavor running in a Lenovo IdeaPad 320S with a far slower base clock speed of 937MHz with boost to 1,038MHz. The memory is also clocked 250MHz lower in this variant of the GPU \u2013 other specs, such as the amount of CUDA cores, remain the same.  The TDP, or thermal design power, of these two versions of the MX150 are very different, too, with the former hitting 25W, and the slower 1D12 only using 10W. So, the latter would appear to be a cut-down version designed for thinner and lighter laptops where thermals are more of a concern.  Update: Nvidia has provided TechRadar with the following statement regarding this report:  \"The MX150 is a Pascal-based GPU featuring 384 CUDA cores. We work closely with OEM [original equipment manufacturer] partners to optimize their specific design constraints for things such as TDP, battery capacity, CPU speed and more. Overall performance and specifications will vary based on OEM implementation and design considerations.\"  Signage for the slow lane?  All this might seem fair enough on the face of it. However, the issue here is that Nvidia doesn\u2019t make any distinction between these two flavors of the GeForce MX150 on its website or in marketing materials, so it isn\u2019t letting would-be buyers know that they are potentially getting a slower spin on the GPU.  That said, on its spec page for the MX150, Nvidia does note: \u201cActual implementation may vary by OEM model. Please refer to OEM website for actual shipping specifications.\u201d  Arguably, then, it\u2019s the notebook manufacturer which is responsible for the implementation of the GPU in its product, and it\u2019s down to the vendor to make the spec clear in the laptop\u2019s product description.  Although Tom\u2019s Hardware, which spotted the original story, argues that, as the different spins on the MX150 have different device IDs, the speed differences are implemented at the firmware level by Nvidia.  So, in short, it\u2019s not clear exactly where any potential lack of transparency lies. But, by all accounts, if you\u2019re buying a laptop with a GeForce MX150, you\u2019d do well to thoroughly check the specs and try to ascertain if the device runs with a slower version of this graphics card, as per these claims.", "stock": "NVDA"}, {"url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/nvidia-is-about-to-cease-support-for-its-graphics-cards-on-32-bit-pcs", "label": 1, "source": "techradar", "date": "2018-04-09", "article": "Following a declaration that it would stop releasing GeForce graphics card drivers for 32-bit operating systems, which came at the end of last year, Nvidia has confirmed that support will officially cease before the end of April.

The grandest of computer problems.\"  On one end of the Constellation system is a server running NVIDIA's Drive Sim software. As you'd probably guess, it simulates all of the technology you'd find on a self-driving car, including sensors, cameras, radar and lidar (the light and distance measuring component). It's powered by the company's GPUs, each of which creates its own stream of sensor data. The simulation server can also render \"photoreal data streams\" to reflect all sorts of driving conditions, like a fierce blizzard or glare during a sunset.  Another server is powered by the company's Drive Pegasus software, which runs all of NVIDIA's autonomous car technology and processes the incoming sensor data. The Pegasus server sends its responses back to the simulation machine for validation. That feedback loop occurs 30 times a second, according to NVIDIA.  Using this dual server setup, car makers will be able to construct all sorts of extreme scenarios to see how their self-driving algorithms react. The obvious drawback is that it's tough to simulate every potential issue, but it's still better than relying entirely on real-world testing (especially since it can easily be run millions of times per day).  Like any machine learning algorithm, NVIDIA's self-driving technology will only get better with every simulation.

NVIDIA also unveiled the DGX-2, the next version of its \"personal AI supercomputer.\" It's about 10 times faster than the previous system, the $149,000 DGX-1, which was powered by its first Volta GPU, the Tesla V100. Notably, the DGX-2 is the first server able to deliver more than two petaflops worth of power. That's mostly due to the revamped V100 GPU, which now sports 32GB of memory. The server is powered by 16 of those cards, all strung together by the company's NVSwitch technology.", "stock": "NVDA"}, {"url": "https://www.engadget.com/2018/01/17/microsoft-surface-book-2-on-sale-everywhere/", "label": 1, "source": "engadget", "date": "2018-01-17", "article": "The 15-inch model is particularly interesting as a graphics and gaming unit, since it comes with a nicely powerful NVIDIA GTX 1060 graphics card (the 13-incher has NVIDIA GTX 1050 graphics).

It's also got onboard wide-view tech, which means colors stay true even from extreme angles. It weighs about 5.5 lbs and is 15.1 x 10.3 x 0.7~0.78 inches.  The $2199 model comes with 16GB of DDR4 RAM and a 256 GB SSD, as well as a 1 TB SSHD. It also has an active aerodynamic system, which ensures that the laptop runs cool without sacrificing speed or performance. The system also runs quietly. As far as ports, it has 1 USB-C, 2 USB-3.1 Gen 1, 2 USB-3.1 Gen2, 1 HDMI 2.0 and 1 3.5-mm jack. It also has a built-in HD camera and mic, with a backlit keyboard.

As before, it's backlit with Gigabyte's Fusion tech, which lights up each key individually with up to 16 million colors -- the laptop's only bit of gaming flash.  Like on many other Windows 10 laptops, the touchpad on Gigabyte's flagship is just okay. The level of friction is good, click pressure isn't too heavy and tapping works well. However, it occasionally mis-detected my palm, and doesn't support three- or four-finger Windows 10 gestures used for summoning Cortana and other functions. Gamers and serious graphics users will want a mouse, but the touchpad will at least do in a pinch.  Speaking of peripherals, the Aero 15X has a generous array of high-speed ports for power users. You get one Thunderbolt, three USB 3.1 ports, SD card slot, HDMI 2.0, mini-DP and even an RJ-45 ethernet port. You can squeeze in a generous amount of storage too, thanks to a pair of M.2 PCI-E slots.  The system also features a pair of 2-watt speakers with Dolby ATMOS for gaming. The quality of the sound, alas, isn't quite worthy of the name, as the Aero 15X, like many laptops, lacks anything approximating bass. The rest of the frequencies, at least, are crystal clear, and the stereo separation is better than average.  The standout design feature is the near bezel-less 15.6-inch display. On top of looking good, it keeps the Aero 15X's size about the same as many 14-inch laptops. It also helps explain how Gigabyte was able to fit so much power and battery life into such a small chassis. The downside to these small bezels is that the 720p webcam is mounted on the hinge, creating a very unflattering angle for Skype calls.  My review model had a 1080p display, but a 4K (3,840 x 2,160) screen is also available. That option gives you 100 percent Adobe RGB coverage but will no doubt drain the battery a lot quicker.  In any case, the 1080p IPS display is fantastic. It now has an excellent maximum 144Hz refresh rate, which is a big step up from the 60Hz screen that disappointed gamers on the last model, although it's still lacking NVIDIA G-Sync support, unfortunately. For graphics users, it packs X-Rite Pantone tech, meaning colors are factory calibrated out of the box.  Performance and Battery Life  Gigabyte's last Aero 15X was already near the top of the performance charts thanks to the Intel quad-core i7-7700HQ processor and NVIDIA GTX 1070 Max-Q graphics. The latest model takes it to another level, though, via Intel's freshly-announced 6-core i7-8750H CPU. Gigabyte has promised up to 50 percent more processing grunt, and my tests bear that out, showing a CPUMark score of 12,500, compared to around 8,900 on the older model.  As a reminder, Max-Q cards are a bit slower than the non-Max-Q versions, but more battery-friendly. So, you'd expect the new Aero to pack more power than an NVIDIA GTX 1060 laptop, but less than one with a GTX 1070. Sure enough, it falls just short of the Alienware 15 in the 3D Mark 11 test suite, and sits another notch below the aforementioned ASUS ROG Zephyrus. However, it smokes models like the Alienware 13 and latest Surface Book, both of which pack the GTX 1060 chip. Performance is closer to the GTX 1070 than the 1060.  To see how the Aero 15X handled games, I tested Witcher 3, Wolfenstein II and Rise of the Tomb Raider. At 1080p, it handled all of those games incredibly smoothly, hitting 120 fps on Rise of the Tomb Raider -- just a smidge below the GTX 1070-equipped Alienware 15. Even on a 4K monitor, the frame rate on Witcher 3 was well over 30 fps, more than acceptable for a laptop so small.  I also edited a couple of videos with the Aero 15X, mixing HD and 4K video, and it really shone. It was snappy and responsive with resource-hungry video, and could render stabilization and other demanding tasks rapidly. Final high-quality, full HD encoding was equally quick.  Gigabyte Aero 15X (2018) 7:45 HP Omen 15 (2017) 2:30 ASUS ROG Zephyrus 1:50 Surface Book with Performance Base (2016) 16:15 Apple MacBook Pro 2016 (15-inch) 11:00 HP Spectre x360 15t 10:17 ASUS ZenBook 3 9:45 Samsung Notebook 9 8:16 Microsoft Surface Pro 4 7:15 Razer Blade Stealth (Fall 2016) 5:36 Dell XPS 15 (2016) 5:25 (7:40 with the mobile charger) Alienware 15 4:31  The Aero 15X has dual fans and two pipes that protect the GPU and CPU from overheating, along with a side air vent to prevent recirculation. However, when gaming, video editing or running an external 4K monitor, the fans crank up and get pretty noisy. During normal use they rarely come on, though, and when they do, the sound is not obnoxious. Most importantly, parts get warm but never hot to the touch. In Gigabyte's Smart Manager, you can even tweak the fans for quiet, normal and gaming operation.  The Aero 15X's superpower is its battery life. It lasted a stellar 7:40 in our battery rundown test, nearly long enough to let me continuously watch movies on a Paris/Vancouver flight. That's about twice as long as the latest GS63VR 7RG Stealth Pro and, miles ahead of the ROG Zephyrus. How did Gigabyte pull this off?  For one thing, the Aero 15X packs a massive 94.24 Wh battery, almost double the 50 Wh unit in the ASUS ROG Zephyrus. It also offloads video playback chores to the integrated Intel UHD 630 graphics, keeping the more power-hungry GTX 1070 idle. You can expect a lot less battery life while gaming, of course, but considerably more than rivals. Again, as with other laptops, I'd expect considerably less battery life with the 4K display option.  Pricing and the Competition  The Aero 15X starts at $2,200 with a 1080p 144Hz display and Windows 10. Stepping up to the 4K screen and Windows Pro will cost you $200 more. It's also launching the slightly de-tuned Aero 15 with the same Intel i7-8750H 6-core processor and still-excellent NVIDIA GTX 1060 graphics, starting at $2,000.  You can get up to 32GB for the Aero 15/15X, and I'd recommend you do just that if you plan on doing graphics work or heavy gaming. Frankly, 16GB just isn't enough anymore for power users, thanks to memory bloat in many apps, especially browsers like Firefox and Chrome. I found that Premiere Pro 2018 CC, another memory hog, used nearly 10GB of RAM at times.  At $2,200, the Aero 15X will be competitive with the aforementioned MSI GS63VR 7RG Stealth Pro ($2,400) and $2,300 ASUS ROG Zephyrus equipped with full NVIDIA GTX 1070 graphics. If you're willing to step down to NVIDIA GTX 1060 graphics, however, the Razer Blade is now considerably cheaper at $1,700.  Wrap-up  With Gigabyte's refresh of the Aero 15X, it now has few faults, blending class-leading performance, portability and incredible battery life. It also has a wide range of ports, an excellent keyboard, and finally, a fast-refreshing 144Hz screen better suited for gaming. However, a better touchpad would have been nice, and the minimalistic design won't thrill those who want their gaming laptops to look the part.  As someone who also does a lot video editing, compositing and 3D animation, graphics performance, weight and battery life are all paramount for me. I recently covered the Geneva Motor Show, and needed something reasonably light with enough power to edit 4K video and sufficient battery life to go most of the day. That's another use case where the Aero 15X really shines, providing all three of those things at once. For people like me, the excellent gaming performance is just a bonus.  All that said, with the launch of Intel's new high-performance laptop CPU's, a wave of lightweight, powerful laptops arrived this week from ASUS, MSI, Samsung and others. The new ASUS ROG Zephyrus M laptop, for instance, has nearly identical specs to the Gigabyte Aero 15X, with the same eighth-gen Core i7 CPU, GTX 1070 Max-Q graphics and 144Hz screen. The same goes for MSI's GS65 \"Stealth Thin\" laptop, so Gigabyte has a lot of high-powered competition incoming.", "stock": "NVDA"}, {"url": "https://www.engadget.com/2018/02/14/cryptocurrency-mining-is-hampering-the-search-for-alien-life/", "label": 1, "source": "engadget", "date": "2018-02-14", "article": "Search For Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) researchers want to build out their operations at two facilities, BBC reported, but they can't find GPUs to buy.  \"We'd like to use the latest GPUs [graphics processing units]... and we can't get 'em,\" SETI chief scientist Dan Werthimer told the BBC. \"This is a new problem, it's only happened on orders we've been trying to make in the last couple of months.\"  Crudely speaking, cryptocurrency miners harness the great processing power of GPUs to work out complex math problems that, when solved, grant coin portions as a payday.

It runs on remote servers powered by NVIDIA's Tesla GPUs, which the company says offers gaming performance on par with its GTX 1080 cards. While NVIDIA isn't divulging further specifications, you can bet they're also stuffed with more than enough RAM and CPU horsepower. (NVIDIA claimed they were the equivalent of a $1,500 gaming PC a year ago.) When you launch GeForce Now, you're actually watching a video streaming to your PC. But since there's very little latency between what you're seeing and your keyboard and mouse inputs, it feels as if the games are running right on your computer.  You don't need a very powerful PC to run the GeForce Now client. At the minimum, NVIDIA recommends using a 3.1GHz Core i3 processor and 4GB RAM, along with either Intel HD 2000, GeForce 600 series or Radeon HD 3000 graphics. Those are all specs you'll find in PCs four to six years old. But of course, solid internet access is a must. You'll need speeds of at least 25Mbps, but NVIDIA advises a 50Mbps connection for the best experience. You'll also have to make sure your computer has a reliable link to your router -- which means you'll either need to use an Ethernet cable or a 5GHz Wi-Fi network.  At the moment, GeForce Now on Macs and PCs only lets you play games you already own on Steam, Blizzard's Battle.net or Ubisoft's Uplay. Anything you don't own can be purchased through the streaming platform. That's a major difference from GeForce Now on NVIDIA's Shield tablet and set-top box, which includes a handful of titles as part of its $7.99 monthly fee as well as games for purchase. Both versions of the service support popular titles like Overwatch, Call of Duty WWII and The Witcher 3, but you'll probably have to wait a bit for them to work with lesser-known games. NVIDIA isn't specifying what it takes to make a game compatible with the service, but I'd wager it has to test them out to make sure nothing breaks in the streaming process.  Setting up GeForce Now is as easy as downloading and installing the client and choosing a title to play. Then you just need to provide your login information for whichever service hosts the game. If you're launching a Steam title, you'll end up seeing the service's familiar Windows interface, where you can either buy the game or download it to your library. One big downside with GeForce Now is that you'll have to install games every time you want to play them, since you're thrown onto a different server whenever you log in. It's not a huge problem, though, since the remote machines are plugged into a fat network pipe and offer unlimited storage.

Here\u2019s what to look for:  EARNINGS FORECAST: Analysts expect Nvidia to report per-share earnings of $1.16 cents, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters, up 17% from the same quarter a year earlier.  REVENUE FORECAST: Analysts expect total revenue of $2.68 billion for the quarter, up 23% from a year earlier.  WHAT TO WATCH:  CHIPS FOR AI: Sales to giant internet companies are the biggest driver of Nvidia\u2019s stock, analysts say. Customers like Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com and Microsoft Corp. have been buying up the company\u2019s graphics chips to drive artificial-intelligence calculations that help them, for instance, auto-tag objects in photos. Data-center growth, which has increased by double digits from quarter to quarter for most of the last two years, declined to 2% in the second quarter, then rebounded to 20% in the third. Investors will be looking for sustained momentum, said analyst Mitch Steves of RBC Capital Markets LLC. He\u2019s looking for mid-single to double-digit sequential growth in data-center sales.  CRYPTOCURRENCY MINING: Miners of electronic currencies like Ethereum have embraced graphics cards to speed up calculations that unearth the digital coins. But such sales, which Nvidia reports in its gaming and OEM segments, are a double-edged sword for the company, analysts said: They\u2019ve been bringing in substantial revenue in recent quarters, but they might disappear if the vogue for cryptocurrency mining wanes. \u201cNvidia has played down importance of crypto because they know it can be fickle depending on the price of the currency, and they want to support their fan base among gamers,\u201d said Stifel Financial Corp. analyst Kevin Cassidy. It is hard to differentiate between online sales to gamers and purchases by miners, he said, but investors will be looking for clues to crypto-related revenue in the quarter and beyond.  NEXT-GEN GAMING CARDS: Sales of gaming gear account for more than half of Nvidia\u2019s annual revenue, propelled by new products. The company has been shipping data-center chips based on its Volta design in significant volume since last summer, but it hasn\u2019t said on when, or even whether, it will roll out gaming cards based on the new architecture. \u201cThe timing is something people will be curious about because it should provide a decent tailwind,\u201d said analyst Blayne Curtis of Barclays PLC.

NVDA -1.32% , which has made a broad push to bring its computing platform into self-driving cars, said Tuesday it will temporarily halt testing of its driverless technology on public roads following the fatal crash of an Uber Technologies Inc. autonomous vehicle.  The company said its suspension involves its own fleet of test cars, which are being driven on public roads in California and New Jersey.  Uber has also used Nvidia\u2019s computing technology in its Volvo XC90 SUVs, the same type of vehicle that struck a pedestrian on March 18 in Tempe, Ariz. The two companies in January officially announced that Uber selected Nvidia\u2019s artificial-intelligence computing system for its fleet of self-driving cars and freight trucks. Nvidia\u2019s chips and software help robot cars instantly crunch the vast amounts of data from sensors and cameras to make split-second decisions.  It isn\u2019t clear if Nvidia\u2019s technology was in the car that struck 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg, who later died of her injuries.  \u201cMost self-driving vehicle prototypes and test vehicles use Nvidia technology,\u201d an Nvidia spokesman said in a statement. \u201cIn some case, customers are developing their own software and we don\u2019t have details of their algorithms.\u201d The spokesman said Nvidia is seeking to find out more details on Uber\u2019s configuration and software.  An Uber spokeswoman declined to comment on the matter.  Police said the Uber vehicle was traveling at about 40 miles an hour and didn\u2019t brake before hitting Ms. Herzberg, who was crossing her bike outside of a crosswalk. Specialists in autonomous technology said the car\u2019s sensors should have detected Ms. Herzberg, and that the car\u2019s artificial-intelligence system should have understood she was a pedestrian.  Following the crash, Uber said it was temporarily suspending testing of its self-driving cars in four cities as investigators studied the incident. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey on Monday barred Uber from testing its cars in the state. At least one auto maker, Toyota Motor Corp. , decided to temporarily halt public testing of its own self-driving vehicles.  Nvidia, a graphics-chip specialist that lately has become the leader in chips for artificial intelligence, said in a prepared statement it was temporarily suspending tests \u201cto learn from the Uber incident.\u201d Its fleet of cars for data collection, which are driven by human drivers, will continue to operate.  Nvidia\u2019s stock was recently down more than 7% to $226.39 on Tuesday following the company\u2019s announcement, which was reported earlier by Reuters.  Nvidia has made big bets on developing artificial intelligence for self-driving cars, and competes head-to-head with Intel Corp. in developing autonomous technology. The company said Tuesday it is working with 370 companies on autonomous vehicle technology, including auto makers such as Audi AG , Daimler AG , Toyota, Volkswagen AG and Volvo Group.  Nvidia has emphasized safety in its autonomous-vehicle program. On Tuesday, the chip maker introduced a system for training self-driving cars using simulation rather than real-world driving of the type that resulted in the fatality in Arizona.  That system feeds computer-generated imagery into the company\u2019s automotive brain, as though the car were viewing the world through cameras and other sensors. The brain\u2019s reactions feed back into the simulator, which alters its imagery accordingly. The technology allows self-driving cars to encounter particular hazards any number of times so they can fine-tune their responses, the company said, ultimately improving their handling of real-world conditions.  In January, Nvidia announced that its self-driving car platform met the international safety standard known as ISO 26262, including features such as redundant functions in case one part of a system fails.

Above, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang speaks at CES earlier this year. Photo: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg News  Nvidia NVDA -1.32% and Facebook are two very different companies. But both have recently come to learn a painful lesson: When tech is everywhere, so are the risks.  Facebook, of course, has been battered over its handling of user data. Nvidia\u2019s challenges are very different. The company, whose main business is making chips for videogames, has spent the past couple of years aggressively building chips designed to run self-driving cars. This has led to partnerships with several auto makers as well as companies like Uber, which has been developing its own fleet of autonomous vehicles.  But the problem with putting tech in the driver\u2019s seat is that the buck tends to stop there as well. One of Uber\u2019s self-driving cars was involved in a fatal accident on March 18. Nvidia\u2019s technology wasn\u2019t blamed for the incident, and CEO Jensen Huang said late Wednesday that Uber doesn\u2019t even use the company\u2019s self-driving car system.  But Nvidia still elected to temporarily suspend tests of the vehicles using its platform while investigating the matter. That has meant a lot of bucks for Nvidia\u2019s investors. The highflying stock has shed 12%\u2014nearly $18 billion in market value\u2014since the accident.  Nvidia still generates most of its sales from graphics chips used in videogames. But the company\u2019s significant advancements with artificial intelligence has opened the door to new and expansive opportunities. Companies like Google, Microsoft and Amazon are snapping up Nvidia\u2019s chips to deploy artificial intelligence capabilities in their data centers. Nvidia\u2019s sales into this segment more than doubled in the fiscal year ended January and are expected to surge more than 60% this year to about $3.2 billion. The company also told analysts on Tuesday that it now sees its total addressable market in this space as being worth about $50 billion in the next five years.  The opportunity for self-driving cars is further out. Nvidia is projected to get 5% of its total revenue from autos in the next two years, but much of that will come from infotainment systems, not autonomous vehicles. But while that may limit the actual business risk, Nvidia\u2019s name is now closely synced to the development of autonomous cars. That means mishaps involving those types of cars will likely weigh on the company\u2019s shares.  That is far different from Facebook, whose core business is under fire. Yet both stocks have fallen sharply over the past two weeks. Nvidia\u2019s was hit so hard in part because its market value has doubled over the past year.  That has put the chipmaker\u2019s value on par with that of much-larger tech names like IBM . Nvidia also is one of the more expensive chip stocks on the market at 35 times forward earnings, though its rapidly expanding bottom line has moderated that valuation a bit. The company\u2019s record to this point suggests it can still deliver on some outsize expectations. But investors should be ready for new twists in the road.

FILE PHOTO - Intel logo is seen behind LED lights in this illustration taken January 5, 2018. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illutration  The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that Intel\u2019s competitive concern about Broadcom\u2019s attempt to buy mobile chip rival Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) had led it to consider a range of acquisitions in response, including a bid for Broadcom.  In response to an inquiry about the Journal\u2019s report, Intel said it does not comment on \u201crumours or speculation\u201d related to mergers and acquisitions but that it is focussed on its previous acquisitions.  \u201cWe have made important acquisitions over the past 30 months - including Mobileye and Altera - and our focus is on integrating those acquisitions and making them successful for our customers and shareholders,\u201d Intel said in a statement to Reuters. Intel acquired autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye last year and acquired programmable chip maker Altera in late 2015.  Broadcom did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Shares of Broadcom rose 3.6 percent to $262.93 in after hours trade on Friday. Qualcomm and Intel each fell less than 1 percent, to $62.87 and $51.84, respectively.  Singapore-based Broadcom\u2019s $117 billion (84.49 billion pounds) bid for Qualcomm faces concerns by U.S. regulators worried about potential Chinese influence on the company and U.S. ability to influence the creation of the next generation of mobile networks, called 5G.  Qualcomm has sought assurances from Broadcom over potential antitrust issues.  Intel is mostly known for making chips that are the brains of personal computers and data centres, though it has made progress gaining smart phone manufacturing customers such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O).  If Broadcom buys Qualcomm, Intel would face a much bigger competitor, nearly equal to itself in market heft.  Broadcom and Qualcomm are worth close to $100 billion each and a combination would be the biggest tech deal ever. An Intel deal would be significantly bigger, since its market capitalisation alone is nearly $240 billion.  The Journal reported that Intel had been considering a Broadcom bid since late last year and was working with advisers, although the newspaper said one of its sources described a bid as unlikely given the complexity of the combination.  Still, antitrust consultant Linley Gwennap said Intel likely could convince regulators to allow it to take over Broadcom, despite the size, since the companies largely make different types of microchips.

The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that Intel\u2019s competitive concern about Broadcom\u2019s attempt to buy mobile chip rival Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) had led it to consider a range of acquisitions in response, including a bid for Broadcom.  In response to an inquiry about the Journal\u2019s report, Intel said it does not comment on \u201crumors or speculation\u201d related to mergers and acquisitions but that it is focused on its previous acquisitions.  \u201cWe have made important acquisitions over the past 30 months - including Mobileye and Altera - and our focus is on integrating those acquisitions and making them successful for our customers and shareholders,\u201d Intel said in a statement to Reuters. Intel acquired autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye last year and acquired programmable chip maker Altera in late 2015.  Broadcom did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Shares of Broadcom rose 3.6 percent to $262.93 in after hours trade on Friday. Qualcomm and Intel each fell less than 1 percent, to $62.87 and $51.84, respectively.  Singapore-based Broadcom\u2019s $117 billion bid for Qualcomm faces concerns by U.S. regulators worried about potential Chinese influence on the company and U.S. ability to influence the creation of the next generation of mobile networks, called 5G.  Qualcomm has sought assurances from Broadcom over potential antitrust issues.  Intel is mostly known for making chips that are the brains of personal computers and data centers, though it has made progress gaining smart phone manufacturing customers such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O).  If Broadcom buys Qualcomm, Intel would face a much bigger competitor, nearly equal to itself in market heft.  Broadcom and Qualcomm are worth close to $100 billion each and a combination would be the biggest tech deal ever. An Intel deal would be significantly bigger, since its market capitalization alone is nearly $240 billion.  The Journal reported that Intel had been considering a Broadcom bid since late last year and was working with advisers, although the newspaper said one of its sources described a bid as unlikely given the complexity of the combination.  Still, antitrust consultant Linley Gwennap said Intel likely could convince regulators to allow it to take over Broadcom, despite the size, since the companies largely make different types of microchips.

Intel logo is seen behind LED lights in this illustration taken January 5, 2018. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration  Most of the lawsuits - 30 - are customer class action cases that claim that users were harmed by Intel\u2019s \u201cactions and/or omissions\u201d related to the flaws, which could allow hackers to steal data from computers.  Intel said in a regulatory filing it was not able to estimate the potential losses that may arise out of the lawsuits.  Security researchers at the start of January publicized two flaws, dubbed Spectre and Meltdown, that affected nearly every modern computing device containing chips from Intel, Advanced Micro Devices Inc and ARM Holdings.  The companies have issued fixes but some patches slowed down computers, leading sector analysts to say producers could potentially face suits from clients and consumers claiming damages because their devices did not work as they should.  The company said the remaining two suits were securities class actions, where the plaintiffs allege that Intel and some of its officers violated securities laws by making statements about products or its internal controls that were later revealed to have been false or misleading.  The company\u2019s filing also listed three individual Intel shareholders who had filed actions against members of Intel\u2019s board and other managers, alleging that they failed their duties to Intel by failing to take action in relation to alleged insider trading.  It did not specify what allegations of wrongdoing the suit dealt with.  Intel Chief Executive Brian Krzanich sold 889,879 shares in the company on Nov. 29 as per a trading plan adopted on Oct. 30, making roughly $39 million from the sale, well before the details of the flaw were made public.  Bloomberg reported last month that although Intel says Krzanich\u2019s sales were part of a pre-arranged stock plan, securities lawyers believed the larger-than-usual transaction could be examined by the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC).  Krzanich said last month that Google researchers told Intel of the flaws \u201ca while ago\u201d.  Google says it informed the affected companies about the Spectre flaw on June 1, 2017 and reported the Meltdown flaw after the first flaw but before July 28, 2017.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illutration  Current and former U.S. government officials have raised concerns that the government was not informed of the flaws before they became public because the flaws potentially held national security implications. Intel said it did not think the flaws needed to be shared with U.S. authorities as hackers had not exploited the vulnerabilities.  Intel did not tell the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team, better known as US-CERT, about Meltdown and Spectre until Jan. 3, after reports on them in online technology site The Register had begun to circulate.  US-CERT, which issues warnings about cyber security problems to the public and private sector, did not respond to a request for comment.  Details of when the chip flaws were disclosed were detailed in letters sent by Intel, Alphabet and Apple Inc on Thursday in response to questions from Representative Greg Walden, an Oregon Republican who chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The letters were seen by Reuters.  Alphabet said that security researchers at its Google Project Zero informed chipmakers Intel, Advanced Micro Devices Inc and SoftBank Group Corp-owned ARM Holdings of the problems in June.  It gave the chipmakers 90 days to fix the issues before public disclosing them, standard practice in the cyber security industry intended to give the targets of bugs time to fix them before hackers can take advantage of the flaws.  Alphabet said it left the decision of whether to inform government officials of the security flaws up to the chipmakers, which is its standard practice.  Intel said it did not inform government officials because there was \u201cno indication that any of these vulnerabilities had been exploited by malicious actors,\u201d according to its letter.  Intel also said it did not perform an analysis of whether the flaws might harm critical infrastructure because it did not think it could affect industrial control systems. But Intel said that it did inform other technology companies that use its chips of the issue, according to its letter.  Intel, Alphabet and Apple could not immediately be reached for comment.  AMD, ARM, Microsoft Corp and Amazon.com Inc also responded to questions from lawmakers.  Microsoft said that it did inform several antivirus software makers about the flaws \u201cseveral weeks\u201d ahead of their public disclosure to give them time to avoid compatibility issues.

Apple Inc. is planning to use its own chips in Mac computers beginning as early as 2020, replacing processors from Intel Corp., according to people familiar with the plans.  The initiative, code named Kalamata, is still in the early developmental stages, but comes as part of a larger strategy to make all of Apple\u2019s devices -- including Macs, iPhones, and iPads -- work more similarly and seamlessly together, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. The project, which executives have approved, will likely result in a multi-step transition.  The shift would be a blow to Intel, whose partnership helped revive Apple\u2019s Mac success and linked the chipmaker to one of the leading brands in electronics. Apple provides Intel with about 5 percent of its annual revenue, according to Bloomberg supply chain analysis.  Intel shares dropped as much as 9.2 percent, the biggest intraday drop in more than two years, on the news. They were down 6.4 percent at $48.75 at 3:30 p.m. in New York.  Apple could still theoretically abandon or delay the switch. The company declined to comment. Intel said, \u201cWe don\u2019t comment on speculation about our customers.\u201d  For Apple, the change would be a defining moment. Intel chips remain some of the only major processor components designed by others inside Apple\u2019s product portfolio. Currently, all iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches, and Apple TVs use main processors designed by Apple and based on technology from Arm Holdings Plc. Moving to its own chips inside Macs would let Apple release new models on its own timelines, instead of relying on Intel\u2019s processor roadmap.  \u201cWe think that Apple is looking at ways to further integrate their hardware and software platforms, and they\u2019ve clearly made some moves in this space, trying to integrate iOS and macOS,\u201d said Shannon Cross, an analyst at Cross Research. \u201cIt makes sense that they\u2019re going in this direction. If you look at incremental R&D spend, it\u2019s gone into ways to try to vertically integrate their components so they can add more functionality for competitive differentiation.\u201d  Stand Out  The shift would also allow Cupertino, California-based Apple to more quickly bring new features to all of its products and stand out from the competition. Using its own main chips would make Apple the only major PC maker to use its own processors. Dell Technologies Inc., HP Inc., Lenovo Group Ltd., and Asustek Computer Inc. use Intel chips.  By using its own chips, Apple would be able to more tightly integrate new hardware and software, potentially resulting in systems with better battery life -- similar to iPads, which use Apple chips.  While the transition to Apple chips in hardware is planned to begin as early as 2020, the changes to the software side will begin even before that. Apple\u2019s iPhones and iPads with custom chips use the iOS operating system, while Mac computers with Intel chips run on a different system called macOS. Apple has slowly been integrating user-facing features over the past several years, and more recently starting sharing lower-level features like a new file management system.  \u2018Marzipan\u2019 Platform  As part of the larger initiative to make Macs work more like iPhones, Apple is working on a new software platform, internally dubbed Marzipan, for release as early as this year that would allow users to run iPhone and iPad apps on Macs, Bloomberg News reported last year.  The company has also previously released Macs with ARM-based co-processors, which run an iOS-like operating system, for specific functions like security. The latest MacBook Pro and iMac Pro include the co-processors. Apple plans to add that chip to a new version of its Mac Pro, to be released by next year, and new Mac laptops this year, according to a person familiar with the matter.  Intel has dominated computing processors for more than a decade, taking market share from Advanced Micro Devices Inc., its only rival in the market. Intel also designs and builds modem chips for some iPhone models so that they can connect to cellular networks and make calls. While Apple is down the list of computer sellers by unit shipments, it\u2019s third when measured by revenue last year, highlighting the premium status of its products.  Apple\u2019s decision to switch away from Intel in PC\u2019s wouldn\u2019t have a major impact on the chipmaker\u2019s earnings because sales to the iPhone maker only constitute a small amount of its total, said Kevin Cassidy, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. A bigger concern would be if this represents part of a wider trend of big customers moving to designing their own components, he said.  In 2005, Apple announced a move to Intel chips in its Macs, an initiative that put former Intel Chief Executive Officer Paul Ottelini on stage with Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. It was a partnership that shook up the PC industry and saw Apple shift away from chips co-developed by IBM and Motorola.  Apple\u2019s current chip designs made their name in thin and light mobile devices. That would indicate Apple will start the transition with laptops before moving the designs into more demanding desktop models. Apple has to walk the fine line of moving away from Intel chips without sacrificing the speed and capabilities of its Macs.  A decision to go with ARM technology in computers might lend it credibility where it has failed to gain a foothold so far. Qualcomm Inc., the biggest mobile phone chip provider, is working with PC makers to introduce new thin and light laptops based on its chips in another attempt to steal share from Intel. Microsoft Corp. is supporting that effort by providing a version of its Windows operating system for ARM technology-based chips.  Intel\u2019s dominance of the market has been based on its ability to use leading manufacturing technology to produce processors that are more powerful than those of its competitors. Its would-be rivals haven\u2019t yet produced designs that have displaced Intel\u2019s products when it comes to crunching data quickly.  Apple\u2019s custom processors have been recently manufactured principally by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Ltd. Its decision may signal confidence that TSMC and other suppliers such as Samsung Electronics Co. have closed the gap on Intel\u2019s manufacturing lead and can produce processors that are just as powerful.", "stock": "INTC"}, {"url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-25/intel-s-rosy-sales-outlook-signals-demand-holding-up-amid-flaw", "label": 1, "source": "bloomberg", "date": "2018-01-25", "article": "Intel Corp., whose microprocessors dominate the personal-computer market, gave an upbeat quarterly and annual sales forecast, signaling optimism that demand will persist even as the industry scrambles to fix vulnerabilities in its PC and server chips.  Sales in the current period will be about $15 billion, plus or minus $500 million, and annual revenue will rise to a record $65 billion, the company said in a statement late Thursday. The projections exceed analysts\u2019 estimates.  Intel shares gained 6 percent in pre-market trading at 6:04 a.m. in New York Friday, after closing at $45.30. The stock rose 27 percent in 2017, lagging behind the 38 percent advance in the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index. The benchmark has outpaced Intel so far this year, too.  Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich is trying to remake Intel into a more general provider of chips, expanding into new markets such as self-driving cars and industrial systems. While those efforts helped, it was a 20 percent sales jump in its data-center chip business that really powered the quarter -- and will determine success for the foreseeable future.  Intel repeated its assertion that chip flaws known as Meltdown and Spectre won\u2019t have a material impact on its finances. Forecasts didn\u2019t budge after the potential exploits were made public in early January. Krzanich said Intel has made progress on patching exposed computer systems, but said he\u2019s \"acutely aware that we have more to do.\u201d  The chipmaker\u2019s outlook indicates that corporations are spending on infrastructure, a good sign for earnings reports by companies such as Microsoft Corp., Kim Forrest, an analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group, which owns Intel shares.  \"They look really good,\u201d she said. \u201cEven the data center came back.\u201d  In the fourth quarter, sales climbed 4.3 percent to $17.1 billion, Intel said. The company posted a net loss of 15 cents a share because of an income tax expense of $5.4 billion, a result of the new U.S. tax law passed last month. Excluding certain items, profit was $1.08 a share. On that basis, analysts had projected 87 cents in profit, on revenue of $16.4 billion.  Intel Chief Financial Officer Bob Swan said the boost in Intel\u2019s sales and profit in the recent quarter came from a return to spending by corporations on their internal networks. That trend may not continue, he said. Sales to cloud-service providers -- companies such as Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and Amazon.com Inc. -- rose 35 percent in the fourth quarter.  \u201cWe see good demand trends\u201d in the first quarter, Swan said in an interview. \u201cThe biggest pleasant surprise was enterprise.\u201d  After it announced the vulnerabilities Jan. 3, Intel said its chips were not faulty -- they work as promised -- noting that the potential exploits affect all modern processors, not just Intel products. It then accepted more responsibility, apologized and began submitting regular updates on efforts to roll out software patches that close security holes. While there have been no reports of data being stolen via these methods, some of the patches have caused computers to repeatedly reboot or slow down, particularly older machines.  Intel\u2019s PC chip unit had fourth-quarter sales of $9 billion, down 2 percent from a year earlier. Santa Clara, California-based Intel is facing a revived challenge in the PC market from longtime rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc.  The data-center unit, which sells powerful, expensive chips for machines that run the internet and corporate networks, had revenue of $5.6 billion, up 20 percent. Intel\u2019s CEO has promised long-term growth in that unit of more than 10 percent, though gains in recent quarters had fallen short of that target. In the third quarter, data-center division sales rose just 7 percent.  Sales of memory chips rose 9 percent, while revenue from chips for a new range of devices that are gaining the ability to compute and connect, known as the internet of things, climbed 21 percent.  Intel\u2019s renewed commitment to memory chips takes it into direct competition with Samsung Electronics Co., the only company in the industry with comparable sales and manufacturing resources.  Intel invented the memory market when the company was founded in the late 1960s. It got out of the business in the early 1990s when competition from Asian companies became too great. This is typically the most volatile part of the chip industry. In some years, producers lose money when supply gluts cause prices to drop. Intel\u2019s latest memory chip foray made money in the fourth quarter, and the company expects it to remain profitable throughout 2018.  While overall performance has been strong by Intel, there are challenges ahead. For one, the company may not have generated enough sales to maintain its 25-year run as the world\u2019s largest chipmaker.

Photographer: Rick Wilking/Reuters  The whole thing was a dizzying reminder that although Intel isn\u2019t the household name it was during the PC boom of the 1990s, it can still put on a show. The company makes about 90 percent of the world\u2019s computer processors and 99 percent of the server chips in the data centers that effectively run the internet. While the world\u2019s largest chipmaker has struggled to expand beyond those core businesses, it reported $60 billion in 2017 revenue at a gross margin of 63 percent, an unimaginable profit for most factory owners.  What made the Intel keynote so surreal was that Krzanich barely mentioned the potentially catastrophic news that was on everyone\u2019s mind. The previous week, the Register, a British technology journal, reported that independent researchers had discovered flaws in Intel\u2019s chip designs that hackers could exploit to steal data thought to be the most secure. These vulnerabilities, known as Meltdown and Spectre, are a very, very big deal, allowing hackers to peek at the part of the computer where companies and individuals store passwords, encryption keys, and most anything sensitive. The flaws are unprecedented. Every PC, every smartphone, and every server in the world is exposed. The episode has already led to lawsuits and calls for investigations, and undermines more than a decade of Intel\u2019s technical wizardry.  For the past few years, major cloud providers have sought ways to reduce their dependence on Intel\u2019s server chip monopoly, quietly developing their own models or funding nascent competitors. And just days before Krzanich took the stage in Vegas, Intel gave those companies\u2014and everybody else\u2014a massive incentive to accelerate those efforts.  Even the researchers who discovered Meltdown and Spectre initially didn\u2019t believe what they were seeing. \u201cThat would have been such a major f--- -up by Intel that it can\u2019t be possible,\u201d researcher Michael Schwarz recalls thinking. Spectre affects all modern chips, including those made by competitors, but the easier hack, Meltdown, applies almost exclusively to chips made by Intel.  The flaws can be patched, but those patches could slow the Intel chips by as much as 30 percent, the equivalent of turning a state-of-the-art server chip into one from 2013. \u201cThere is no playbook for something like this,\u201d says Charles Carmakal, a vice president at Mandiant, the arm of security company FireEye that consults on high-profile hacks. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen a vulnerability that worked across so many different operating systems and devices.\u201d  If the slowdown turns out to be anywhere near as bad as some think it could be, it\u2019ll amount to a major price increase for data center owners, who could in turn demand that Intel cover the cost. (So far, the big cloud providers have said their customers won\u2019t be affected. Their plans, and the costs, remain unclear.) And because Intel is so reliant on chip revenue, there\u2019d be no easy way to make up those losses. Intel\u2019s stock is down 5 percent since the Register report; shares of Advanced Micro Devices Inc., its only real competitor for PC and server chips, are up 11 percent.  During the six months Intel was quietly working to try to fix the vulnerabilities, Krzanich sold $24 million in company shares. Intel says the stock sale was part of a plan that had been in place before anyone there knew about Meltdown or Spectre, but the day after Krzanich\u2019s CES speech, two U.S. senators sent letters to the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice demanding investigations. Consumer and shareholder lawyers have filed a dozen class actions against Intel, and there are few signs the pressure will let up on Krzanich anytime soon. In a research note, an analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. called the stock sale \u201cindefensible.\u201d  \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen a vulnerability that worked across so many different operating systems and devices\u201d  Intel, which declined to make Krzanich available for comment, has treated Meltdown and Spectre as something close to a nonstory. In its initial statement, issued on Jan. 3, the company disputed that Spectre and Meltdown represented \u201cflaws,\u201d describing them as merely a new field of \u201cresearch\u201d into an industrywide phenomenon. It said any slowdowns would be minimal, close to zero for most people, and that the episode would have no impact on Intel\u2019s business. At CES, after Algorithm \u2019n Blues but before Romo, Krzanich briefly addressed the not-flaw by thanking Intel\u2019s peers for \u201ccoming together\u201d to \u201caddress the recent security findings.\u201d  Intel\u2019s clients, including the biggest companies in the technology industry, have mostly kept quiet. They have no alternative supplier. Privately, some are seething. The day after Krzanich\u2019s big show, Microsoft Corp. published a blog post disputing Intel\u2019s earlier assertion that users wouldn\u2019t notice the slowdowns. Navin Shenoy, an Intel executive vice president, said in a statement that customer security is \u201ca critical priority\u201d for the company. In private conversations with clients, Intel\u2019s top managers haven\u2019t always acted that way, treating a disaster that threatens the security of every computer user and the profits of a whole category of businesses as no big deal, according to an executive at one of Intel\u2019s large customers. The potential fallout isn\u2019t an academic concern, the executive says, \u201cit\u2019s f---ing scary.\u201d  Part of what makes Meltdown and Spectre so terrifying is that they upend more than a decade of conventional wisdom about information security. Starting in the mid-2000s, Intel added a layer of security within its chips and began encouraging developers to store users\u2019 most sensitive information in the walled-off area rather than in regular software memory. Only about two years ago did researchers first notice, and begin trying to crack, a feature called speculative execution that Intel uses to speed up its chips. It essentially allows a chip to access any data it guesses a user is about to ask for, even if it\u2019s inside the secure area, before checking whether the user is allowed to access it. This is a big reason computers and smartphones have kept getting faster year after year. It also left a gaping security hole.  The feature\u2019s vulnerabilities were discussed at conferences and in academic papers but were considered merely theoretical until last spring, when Jann Horn, a 22-year-old researcher in Google\u2019s elite cybersecurity division, succeeded in reading private data from the secure area. Horn informed Intel in June, beating out three other research teams that discovered the flaw later in 2017. Together, they began working with Intel to patch the flaws; until the Register report, they\u2019d planned to disclose their findings on Jan. 9. As Google pointed out in a blog post about the discovery, the security flaws could allow a cloud user to covertly snoop on another customer\u2019s machine. Anyone with an Amazon Web Services account could, in theory, steal another AWS user\u2019s login data and access their files, though that would often require physical access to the target machine.  In interviews, Intel executives dispute suggestions that the company\u2019s focus on chip speeds led it to overlook obvious vulnerabilities. Intel says it\u2019s already provided software fixes for 90 percent of its chips and that this is nothing out of the ordinary. \u201cWe have an ongoing process to make our products better,\u201d says Stephen Smith, general manager of the company\u2019s data center group. \u201cWe just happen to be doing it under a spotlight now.\u201d At CES, Krzanich told the crowd that \u201cas of now\u201d Intel had \u201cnot received any information that these exploits have been used to obtain customer data.\u201d  This sounds more comforting than it probably should. Security analysts say that if four groups of researchers independently figured out the exploits, then some number of governments with sophisticated cyberweapons programs (China, Russia, the U.S.) likely did, too. An intelligence agency armed with Spectre or Meltdown would likely aim big, according to Mandiant\u2019s Carmakal. \u201cA government wouldn\u2019t use this to break into Target,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019d use it to get into the Department of Defense.\u201d  So far, Meltdown and Spectre probably pose less risk to the average person than, say, a simple phishing attack in which a hacker tries to send you to a malicious website. They won\u2019t lead to the kind of widespread panic that resulted from the 2017 hack of Equifax\u2019s customer database.  But that could change. Hackers who hadn\u2019t tried to break into Intel\u2019s hardware, believing there was no way it would leave a side door open, are now seeking ways in. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be looking for other things like this,\u201d says Jeff Pollard, an analyst with the research firm Forrester. \u201cThis is a new kind of attack. This is going to linger.\u201d  And long-term fixes won\u2019t be easy. While coders can pull a few all-nighters to close holes in software, a chip takes years to design, test, and mass-produce. Each model can cost tens of millions of dollars to develop. For now, computer owners and data center operators will have to make an unsavory choice: Use Intel\u2019s software patches and accept slower speeds, or skip the patches and remain at risk. (Intel has already said patches are causing some machines to reboot more often than usual.) Future designs will include hard-wired fixes that speed things up, but the first versions of those won\u2019t appear until later this year, the company says.  All of this puts Intel in a tough spot. The company is a nonfactor in the smartphone-chips business dominated by Samsung, Qualcomm, and ARM, and rival Nvidia has taken a commanding lead in the fast-growing market for graphics chips used in artificial intelligence applications. Now, Meltdown and Spectre threaten the core of Intel\u2019s business. The company has no competitor in server chips at the moment, but this episode could change that. Microsoft and Google have publicly praised Qualcomm Inc.\u2019s first server chip, which went on sale in November, and Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook all have internal divisions working on chip designs.  Intel\u2019s more immediate threat is political. It\u2019ll almost certainly have to withstand criticism from lawmakers at a time when governments around the world are increasingly skeptical of tech companies with de facto monopolies. \u201cThis hyper-dependence on one chipmaker, indeed one technology, although billed as a way to lower prices, has had the effect also of greatly increasing society\u2019s exposure not only to hackers but also to \u2018shock events\u2019 that disrupt entire systems,\u201d the Open Markets Institute, a Washington think tank that advocates for controls on market concentration, wrote in its weekly newsletter on Jan. 11. For now, Intel\u2019s big problem is Krzanich\u2019s stock sales, but if it becomes clear that customers have been harmed by hacking or higher costs, regulators will likely seek recourse through consumer protection suits, antitrust investigations, or both.  Intel has faced this kind of public pressure before. In 1994 the company was heavily criticized for trying to ignore evidence that its Pentium chips were generating errors for certain obscure calculations. The crisis caused IBM to announce that it would no longer ship machines that used the flawed chips. Intel\u2019s meticulously constructed brand, Intel Inside, which had served as a sort of Good Housekeeping Seal for computer buyers, suddenly looked questionable. As part of Intel\u2019s extensive mea culpa, then-CEO Andy Grove offered to replace all the buggy chips and took an inventory writedown of $475 million, about half its annual R&D budget at the time.  Grove\u2019s lesson, as he recounted in his business-advice book Only the Paranoid Survive, was that Intel had been caught out. Even a quarter-century into its existence, the massive company still saw itself as a scrappy tech startup. With its size and influence, he acknowledged, came new responsibilities. \u201cThe trouble was,\u201d Grove wrote, \u201cnot only didn\u2019t we realize that the rules had changed, but what was worse, we didn\u2019t know what rules we now had to abide by.\u201d  Intel has been the top chipmaker for the past 25 years, but Meltdown and Spectre could turn out to be much worse than the Pentium bug. If the company wants to maintain its position, it\u2019ll need real humility, not cheap theatrics.  \u2014With Dina Bass, Mark Bergen, Alex Webb, and Dune Lawrence", "stock": "INTC"}, {"url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-20/amd-confirms-chip-vulnerability-says-report-exaggerated-danger", "label": 0, "source": "bloomberg", "date": "2018-03-20", "article": "Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Intel Corp.\u2019s main rival in computer microprocessors, said a report earlier this month alleging that its chips have widespread, fundamental vulnerabilities greatly exaggerated the severity of the threat.  There are 13 potential exploits that will be fixed within weeks through software updates, the chipmaker said Tuesday in a statement. There\u2019s no evidence that of any of those holes has been used for malevolent purposes, and it would be extremely difficult to use any of them to attack computers, the Sunnyvale, California-based company said. AMD saw reports of unusual trading activity in its stock about a week ago when an Israeli company called CTS Labs went public with a report on the flaws and has reported it to the relevant authorities.  The chip industry was stung at the beginning of the year when Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google revealed that a flaw in all modern microprocessors may allow hackers to steal data such as passwords or encryption keys previously thought to be secure. AMD argued at the time that its chips were less at risk than those from Intel, which dominates the market for computer microprocessors.  \u201cIt\u2019s important to note that all the issues raised in the research require administrative access to the system, a type of access that effectively grants the user unrestricted access to the system,\u201d AMD Chief Technology Officer Mark Papermaster said in the statement, referring to the recent report. \u201cAny attacker gaining unauthorized administrative access would have a wide range of attacks at their disposal well beyond the exploits identified in this research.\u201d  The issue isn\u2019t related to the vulnerabilities Google identified in January and isn\u2019t caused by AMD\u2019s Zen architecture, a new design that underpins all of its new chips, AMD said in its statement. The chipmaker said that, unlike the more widespread Spectre and Meltdown issues identified in January, software fixes for the currently discovered vulnerabilities won\u2019t slow down computers.  On March 12, CTS Labs contacted AMD about the potential exploits. Then the firm went public 24 hours later with its report, according to AMD.  \u201cThe vulnerabilities we have discovered allow bad actors who infiltrated the network to persist in it, surviving computer reboots and re-installations of the operating system, while remaining virtually undetectable by most endpoint security solutions,\u201d CTS said in the report. \u201cThis allows attackers to engage in persistent virtually undetectable espionage, buried deep in the system and executed from AMD\u2019s Secure Processor and chipset.\u201d  CTS estimated that it would take \u201cmany months\u201d to address the issue. The researcher didn\u2019t give AMD that amount of time to fix the holes before drawing public attention to them, something that goes against standard practice in these situations.  \u201cI fault CTS Labs for not following industry-standard coordinated disclosure procedure,\u201d said Ben Gras, a researcher at Vrije University in Amsterdam who focuses on hardware security flaws. \u201cA widely accepted practice in these situations is to coordinate with the vendor and affected parties during a window of confidentiality before publicizing security sensitive information, reducing the impact of the research while still maintaining transparency. As it stands, this leads me to believe they are not acting in good faith, and make me interpret other aspects of this report skeptically.\u201d  On Wednesday, CTS said it disagreed with AMD\u2019s assessment of the risks posed by the weaknesses and the time frame for patching them. \"Our view is that AMD is attempting to downplay the significance of its vulnerabilities,\" CTS said in a statement.  \u2014 With assistance by Jeremy Kahn, and Gwen Ackerman", "stock": "INTC"}, {"url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-03/spotify-poised-to-list-in-turbulent-time-for-shares-tech-update", "label": 1, "source": "bloomberg", "date": "2018-04-03", "article": "Music-streaming service Spotify Technology SA has avoided the traditional path to a stock listing, eschewing costly investment bankers and saying it wants to price its shares at a level that will ensure stability rather than a big jump on the first day of trading.

How Apple Built a Chip Powerhouse to Threaten Qualcomm and Intel  The company already makes many of the chips for its iPhones, iPads, Macs and Watches. By Mark Gurman January 29, 2018 By Mark Gurman  For several years, Apple has been steadily designing more and more of the chips powering its iPhones, iPads, Macs and Apple Watches. This creates a better user experience and helps trump rivals. Recently the company got a fresh incentive to go all-in on silicon: revelations that microprocessors with components designed by Intel Corp., Arm Holdings Plc and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. are vulnerable to hacking. Steve Jobs long believed Apple should own the technologies inside its products rather than rely on mashups of components from other chip makers, including Samsung, Intel and Imagination Technologies. In 2008, the company made a small but significant step in that direction by acquiring boutique chip maker P.A. Semi. Two years later, Jobs unveiled the iPad. The world focused on the tablet\u2019s giant touchscreen, book-reading prowess and creativity apps. But the most ground-breaking technology was hidden away inside: the A4, Apple\u2019s first processor designed in-house. That original \u201csystem-on-a-chip\u201d has since been succeeded by increasingly powerful processors. Today, Apple packs its devices with custom components that process artificial intelligence tasks, track your steps, power game graphics, secure Face ID or Touch ID data, run the Apple Watch, pair AirPods to your phone and help make Macs work the way they do. The result: a chip powerhouse that could one day threaten the dominance of Qualcomm Inc. and even, eventually, Intel.

Apple declined to comment. Apple isn\u2019t the first company to create its own chips in-house. It\u2019s just the most successful. HP Inc., Motorola, International Business Machines Corp. and Koninklijke Philips NV all had chip divisions at one time or another. Those ultimately failed or stumbled because chip-making is the sport of kings: It\u2019s brutally expensive and requires massive scale. Apple has wisely focused on designing its silicon (for its system on a chips, Apple uses reference designs from Arm Holdings Plc). Manufacturing is left to others, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Apple\u2019s push into the complicated and pricey chips business makes sense so long as the company is selling 300 million devices a year. And it's not as though the entrenched players are going anywhere. Qualcomm is investing in next-generation 5G networks, several companies are making AI chips and Intel is pushing mobile processors. Meanwhile, Samsung, Apple's arch rival, is a major chip manufacturer in its own right. Apple has chip-building and testing facilities in unmarked buildings in and around hometown Cupertino, California, and in Herzliya, Israel, a hotbed of new technologies. The operation employs hundreds of people and is run by Johny Srouji, who joined Apple in 2008 after stints at Intel and IBM and has likened his chip architects to \u201cartists.\u201d In recent months, Srouji has been poaching more and more modem engineers from Qualcomm. The chipmaker builds iPhone modems but is engaged in a legal battle with Apple over licensing fees Qualcomm charges smartphone makers. Hiring Qualcomm people could mean Apple plans to eventually create its own modems, which connect phones to cellular networks. For now, Apple is considering using Intel and MediaTek Inc. exclusively for modems in this year\u2019s iPhone lineup, Bloomberg News reported last year.

The new iPad, due to be released toward the end of the year, will probably also include the Apple-designed graphics engine and AI chip.

The engineer\u2019s private airfield is nestled in a valley on the Northern California coast between Monterey and Santa Barbara, and it\u2019s remote by design, out past a swirl of tan and green fields. Bevirt, a 44-year-old whose bursts of childlike delight punctuate his otherwise quiet intensity, bounds out to greet the chopper, then points the arriving pair of reporters to the prototype resting on the dirt runway nearby. It\u2019s an exotic-looking white aircraft with numerous propellers. (Bevirt agreed to the visit only on the condition that physical specifics remain unpublished.) He calls it an air taxi. \u201cThis is what I have been dreaming about for 40 years,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the culmination of my life\u2019s work.\u201d  Bevirt is the founder and chief executive officer of Joby Aviation Inc., a startup that\u2019s spent the past nine years trying to design and build a whole new kind of short-hop aircraft. Believe it or not, things have been going well. We were the first two reporters to see a demo of the prototype, named Rachel after the women several of its creators used to date. The pilot managed a vertical takeoff, 15 minutes of flight in a 15-mile loop, and a safe landing. Powered by electric motors and sophisticated control software, the taxi performs like a cross between a drone and a small plane, able to zip straight up on takeoff and then fly at twice the speed of a helicopter while making about as much noise as a swarm of superbees. Bevirt says thousands of these sky cabs will one day shuttle people around cities, soaring above the conventional traffic below.  Broken promises of flying cars predate The Jetsons, but Bevirt has made believers out of people with deep pockets. On Feb. 1, Joby Aviation announced a fresh $100 million in venture funding, more than three times the capital it had raised before, from investors including Intel Capital, Toyota AI Ventures, JetBlue Technology Ventures, and Capricorn Investment Group, a prominent backer of Tesla and Space Exploration Technologies. \u201cThere are a lot of dreamers in this space, but we have done a lot of research here, and JoeBen has absolutely nailed the right time for it,\u201d says Bonny Simi, president of JetBlue\u2019s investment arm.  Thanks to advances in electric motors, batteries, software, and other components, the field of flying cars, air taxis, or whatever you want to call them (Sky Segways?) is a lot more crowded than it was even a couple of years ago. Larry Page, the CEO of Google parent Alphabet Inc., has pumped tens of millions of dollars into startups Kitty Hawk and Zee.Aero. A dozen other startups around the world have similar projects at various stages of design, as do Airbus SE and Boeing Co. Even Uber Technologies Inc. claims to be working on an air taxi service, tentatively called Uber Elevate. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to happen within the next 10 years,\u201d Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said during a Jan. 22 speech at a tech conference in Munich.  Bevirt\u2019s secrecy extends to the environs of Joby\u2019s camouflaged lair: The trailers that serve as his engineers\u2019 flight-control centers are covered in posters warning them about the area\u2019s mountain lions, snakes, spiders, and other deadly fauna. Bevirt does say Joby intends to build an aircraft that will hold four passengers and a pilot and will travel at least 150 miles on a single charge at an altitude of a few thousand feet or less. (That would mean the cabin wouldn\u2019t need to be pressurized.) \u201cAnother goal is to be 100 times more quiet during takeoff and landing than a helicopter and near-silent during flyovers,\u201d says Joby Executive Chairman Paul Sciarra, a co-founder of Pinterest, the image-centric wish list site.  All told, Joby\u2019s venture funding totals about $130 million  A trained mechanical engineer and sci-fi nerd, Bevirt made a fortune selling bendable tripods and other camera accessories more than a decade ago. He\u2019s poured that money into his aviation startup. A couple of years back, he had 35 people working on various prototype craft; now he has 120, most of them working far from the airfield at his 500-acre ranch in Santa Cruz. There, engineers make just about every part of the air taxi prototype, from the body and motors to the flight-control software.  Joby says it plans to mass-produce its air taxis for a ride-hailing service that it will operate. Bevirt\u2019s vision includes a landing pad for every office and cul-de-sac. Each trip, he says, will cost about as much as an Uber or Lyft ride does today, and eventually the air taxis will be fully autonomous. \u201cOur mission is to save a billion people an hour a day,\u201d he says. He\u2019s less confident about a rollout date, partly because the formidable challenges ahead include convincing politicians, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the cab-hailing public that air taxis are safe. \u201cWe are well into the design and build of the production vehicle\u201d was the most he\u2019d say on the subject of time to market.  While a whiff of the surreal hangs over Bevirt\u2019s claims that he\u2019ll \u201cchange people\u2019s relationship with aircraft,\u201d some of his investors are counting on it. JetBlue\u2019s Simi says she sees Joby as part of a broader shift in the aerospace industry, a way to make more personal forms of air travel a part of daily life. JetBlue has also invested in Zunum Aero, which is building an electric jet that can fly dozens of people 1,000 miles. And though Intel owns a stake in a German air taxi startup called Volocopter GmbH, Wendell Brooks, president of Intel Capital, says Joby \u201cis very far ahead relative to all the other things we\u2019ve seen.\u201d  For more on flying cars, check out the Decrypted podcast:  For more on the future of transportation, go to Bloomberg.com/hyperdrive", "stock": "INTC"}, {"url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-25/china-seeks-its-own-brains-to-steer-30-million-autonomous-cars", "label": 1, "source": "bloomberg", "date": "2018-03-25", "article": "Value of China\u2019s yearly chip imports dwarfs that of crude oil  China\u2019s aspiration to deploy 30 million autonomous vehicles within a decade is seeding a fledgling chip industry, with startups like Horizon Robotics Inc. emerging to build the brains behind those wheels.  The Beijing-based company is taking aim at Nvidia Corp. and Mobileye NV just as the autonomous-driving business takes off and uncertainty looms over international trade. Annual revenue from the chips used in driverless vehicles globally should more than double to $5 billion by 2021, according to Gartner Inc.

That industrial policy is meant to help China reduce its 1.75 trillion yuan ($276.4 billion) in annual chip imports, a value dwarfing its oil imports.  \u201cChina has to spare no efforts to pick up and develop its own chip technology to improve our own sense of security, especially when the U.S. government is making us fearful about any protectionism against China,\u201d Wei Shaojun, director of the Beijing-based Institute of Microelectronics at Tsinghua University, said at a forum in Shanghai.

Overseers of the world\u2019s largest car market -- and electric-vehicle market -- want to put Chinese-developed chips under those hoods and behind those dashboards. The government expects to have a manufacturing industry for parts such as sensors and embedded chips with a production value exceeding 100 billion yuan by 2020.

Horizon Robotics was founded in 2015 by Yu Kai, the former head of Baidu Inc.\u2019s artificial-intelligence business called the Institute of Deep Learning. Its investors include Intel Capital Corp., Shanghai-based Harvest Fund Management Co., Russian billionaire Yuri Milner and state-owned China Jianyin Investment Ltd.

Photographer: Giulia Marchi/Bloomberg  In an industry where the number of LEDs in a brake light is scrutinized for impact on gas mileage, processing data from laser, radar and camera sensors without draining an electric battery poses an enormous challenge for chipmakers.  \u201cWhat we are seeking is a horse that can run fast and long but eats as little as possible,\u201d Yu said. \u201cIf the embedded vehicle chip consumes too much power, it will lead to a burning car rather than a running car.\u201d  Audi selected Horizon Robotics for a China-specific project and will evaluate the outcome before taking any next steps, Johanna Barth, a Beijing-based spokeswoman for Audi, said without elaborating.  Audi still uses Nvidia and Mobileye sensors in cars sold outside China, she said.  Nvidia, based in Santa Clara, California, has recorded revenue growth of more than 20 percent for the last seven quarters, partly because of increasing demand for autonomous vehicles. It teamed with Baidu to develop an autonomous-vehicle platform, with plans to install that in cars made by Chery Automobile Co.  \u201cWe are working with Chinese automakers and the Chinese ecosystem, as well as global automakers that sell vehicles in China,\u201d said Danny Shapiro, senior director of automotive at Nvidia.  One of those customers is Tusimple Inc., a Beijing-based startup developing self-driving trucks. Tusimple, set to start commercial operation of truck fleets in Arizona and Shanghai next year, is backed by investors including Nvidia.  \u201cWe are satisfied with Nvidia\u2019s chip, which has the strongest computing power for self-driving solutions,\u201d said Hou Xiaodi, Tusimple\u2019s chief technology officer.  Jerusalem-based Mobileye, bought by Intel last year for $15 billion, provides image sensing and processing technology for driver-assistance features. It wants to expand in China through its fourth-generation EyeQ chip and a mapping system called Road Experience Management, said Danielle Mann, a spokeswoman for Intel.  Mobileye will bring the mapping system to China via partnerships with SAIC Motor Corp. and Beijing-based digital map provider NavInfo Co.  Yet, China has the money and commitment to make itself a force in semiconductor development, just as it\u2019s doing now with electric vehicles.  China\u2019s industrial priorities include becoming a leader in advanced manufacturing businesses, including integrated circuits, 5G mobile communications, aircraft engines and new-energy vehicles, Premier Li Keqiang told the National People\u2019s Congress on March 5.

His briefings of Apple breakthroughs over the years were legendary, and featured huge visuals behind him as he paced the stage. He was not just an innovator but also a master communicator. When I had to give addresses back in my military days, I would dive into Carmine Gallo\u2019s \u201cThe Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs\u201d for inspiration.  Watching Russian President Vladimir Putin roll out a similar display of fearsome new weapons at his state of the federation speech the other day had the distinct feeling of watching a Steve Jobs-style brief put together by \"Q,\" the gadget-loving quartermaster from MI6, in a twisted James Bond movie. But this bag of tricks is neither a new iPhone nor an Aston Martin with machine guns, or even an exploding pen. Putin was talking about nuclear weapons moving toward the U.S. on a variety of new platforms. How seriously should we take this?  Let\u2019s put aside that the video's special effects seemed straight from a 1990s video game, and start with the purported weapons themselves. In each case, U.S. intelligence has been tracking the development of these systems over the past decade. There is a nuclear-tipped and nuclear-powered torpedo; a new generation intercontinental ballistic missile with longer ranges; a nuclear-powered cruise missile that could theoretically fly more or less forever and attack the U.S. from any location; an air-launched high-speed cruise missile; and a hypersonic glide missile capable of flying 20 times the speed of sound. He also mentioned new laser systems to deploy against U.S. weapons. He described several of the weapons as \u201cinvincible.\u201d  His motivation in hyping these systems is threefold. First, in the \u201call politics is local\u201d category, he has an election coming up on March 18. While he is predictably and comfortably in the lead in all the polls (fairly easy to do when your opponents are assassinated or jailed and you have complete media control), he still wants to play to his base, as the saying goes. Russians, like people everywhere, enjoy nothing so much as a big spectacle on a huge stage. Add to that a good bashing of Russia\u2019s enemy No. 1, and you have a sure winner.  Second, Putin is communicating with his circle of dictatorial allies and partners around the world. His message to Bashar al-Assad in Syria, Kim Jung Un in North Korea, and the ayatollahs in Iran (can you spell \u201caxis of evil\u201d?) is one of reassurance that someone can stand up to the U.S. in terms of global deterrence and high-end military technology. The demonstration is also a good way to enhance the sales of Russian weapons systems globally -- its producers are currently the second-largest supplier of weapons in the world and would love to surpass the U.S. Indeed, Russia exports as much as Germany, France and the U.K. combined, and triple what China sells globally.  Finally, Putin is sending a very direct signal to Washington. He hates U.S. and Western interference with Russia at any level, from the sanctions over the invasion of Ukraine and annexation of Crimea to the Olympic punishments meted out after the massive doping scandal. The intent here is simple and brutal: We are a nuclear power and can destroy your nation. The fact that the U.S. can do the same to Russia is not lost on Putin, but he will never miss a chance to remind the U.S. that Russia has an equally lethal nuclear arsenal.  In terms of serious military capability, last week's demonstration was a mixed bag. Nothing he displayed represented either a shock to the U.S. intelligence community or a significant change in the existing balance of nuclear and conventional power. Several of the systems have not been demonstrated publically, nor put into serious production. The most worrisome over time is probably the nuclear torpedo, but the idea of a Russian first-strike remains extremely remote. And it is hard to envision a scenario in which the U.S. decides to strike Russia. The odds are extremely high that we will continue along with the same deterrent regime that has kept the nuclear peace since the end of World War II: mutual assured destruction.  In terms of policy issues, Putin's display of braggadocio underscores several important points. First is that stepping up the U.S. conventional force posture in Europe is going to be critical to deterring Russia from using these kinds of weapons to threaten the Europeans. For a start, this means having a full four U.S. brigade combat teams in place and permanently stationed in Europe. We also must continue to push NATO allies to up their game in terms of forces that are combat-ready.  It also emphasizes the importance of avoiding an escalation on both sides, in terms of producing and deploying low-yield nuclear weapons, which could very quickly intensify in a tense scenario and cause Russia to use one of these strategic weapons -- what analysts refer to as the \"escalate to de-escalate\" doctrine. Finally, it will require the Pentagon to develop comparable systems to maintain deterrence, particularly hyper-sonic nuclear-tipped cruise missiles, where Russian progress is outstripping out own.  Another striking aspect of Putin's presentation was his hyper-vitriolic tone, even compared to his previous stridency on such occasions. Given that he will in all likelihood remain Russia's leader for life, we should pay significant attention to the uber-aggressive style of the display. It is hard to imagine any U.S. president in modern history, including even the current incumbent, depicting nuclear attacks on Russia on a large-screen display. It screams of a man desperate for respect, and such men can be very dangerous over time -- especially if they hold a relatively weak overall hand of cards.  And Putin does: Russia has profound demographic problems (also alluded to in Putin\u2019s speech); serious environmental challenges; a struggling economy highly concentrated on hydrocarbons; and few real allies in the world. In many ways, we should worry more about Russian weakness than Russian strength.  For the U.S., the best move with Russia remains simple and transactional: confront where we must (Ukraine, Syria, cyber-intrusions); but cooperate where we can. The latter includes counter-narcotics, counter-piracy, counterterrorism, Afghanistan, the Arctic and other mutual concerns. And there are reasonable \u201cTrack 2\u201d diplomatic options for the nations, such as exchanges between academic institutions, think tanks, laboratories and commercial entities.  We are not quite yet in a new Cold War, but it isn\u2019t hard to see one shimmering in the near distance. Most worrisome of all, U.S. and Russian military forces are in combat in close proximity in Syria, and we are watching our military jets and warships maneuvering at close quarters in the Black and Baltic Seas. We are one significant tactical mistake away from stumbling into real danger. Leaders on both sides need to take a deep breath and encourage their subordinates to do the same.

The company is trading up 6.78% to $48.37 after reporting a top and bottom line beat for the fourth quarter. Intel reported adjusted earnings of $1.08 per share vs Wall Street estimates of $0.87 per share, and revenue of $17.1 billion vs. analysts' estimates of $16.34 billion.  The results were the first for the company after the disclosure of major security flaws known as Spectre and Meltdown. The flaws have rocked the tech world since Google engineers wrote a detailed description of the flaws on January 3. The vulnerabilities affect every major CPU maker, but Intel has taken the brunt of the impact as its chips are affected more than others.  The flaws are especially worrisome because they were built into Intel's hardware, making fixes to existing chips more challenging, but the company said it would begin shipping chips without the flaws later this year.  \"We've been working around clock,\" Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said. \"We're acutely aware we have more to do.\"  Intel did not detail the potential financial impacts of the flaws in its report, but analysts weren't really expecting the company to.  \"While Meltdown/Spectre could cause purchases to be postponed in 1H, it still too early to tell, and we doubt INTC will guide to such an event for fear of driving a self-fulfilling prophecy,\" John Pitzer, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said before the report.

Apple's reported plans to ditch Intel's processing chips in favor of its own has the potential to wipe billions of dollars of revenue from the chipmaker.  That total potential impact could reach between $3 billion and $4 billion of lost sales, according to RBC Capital Markets. The bank looked at the number of Mac computers with Intel units sold last year, which was roughly 19 million units, as well as the average selling price for its microprocessing units ($170 to $215) to arrive at that number. Credit Suisse analysts figured the switch could cost Intel $2.7 billion.  \"We think AAPL's potential shift to in-house designed Mac processors could create a modest impact for INTC depending on the magnitude and timing of the transition,\" Amit Daryanani, an RBC analyst wrote in a note to clients.

The guidelines come amid scrutiny of a massive stock sale Intel CEO Brian Krzanich made last fall after his company found out about \u2014 but before it publicly disclosed \u2014 the Meltdown and Spectre attacks.  The agency advised companies to disclose such incidents to investors in a \"timely\" manner.  It also warned executives and directors not to trade in their companies shares in the time in between finding out about a \"material\" security problem and disclosing it to the public.  Intel CEO Brian Krzanich sold millions of dollars worth of company stock after his company became aware of the Spectre and Meltdown security vulnerabilities, but before they became public.  The Securities and Exchange Commission has a bit of advice for other executives thinking of doing something similar: Don't.  In new guidelines issued on Wednesday, the agency warned that security breaches and vulnerabilities could constitute \"material\" information, noting that it's illegal under US securities laws for insiders to trade stocks based on such information before it becomes public. Such sales may also violate companies' ethics and insider trading policies.  \"Directors, officers, and other corporate insiders must not trade a public company's securities while in possession of material nonpublic information, which may include knowledge regarding a significant cybersecurity incident experienced by the company,\" the SEC said in the guidelines.  It continued: \"Companies should have policies and procedures in place to [...] guard against directors, officers, and other corporate insiders taking advantage of the period between the company's discovery of a cybersecurity incident and public disclosure of the incident to trade on material nonpublic information.\"  Additionally, the SEC encouraged companies to disclose security breaches and vulnerabilities to investors in a \"timely fashion.\"  The new guidelines follow disclosures of the Meltdown and Spectre attacks  The guidelines come less than two months after Intel and other tech companies disclosed the Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities. Those vulnerabilities, which take advantage of a feature found in nearly all computer processors, could be used in cyberattacks that would allow malicious actors to steal private data stored on computers, such as passwords.  The exploits were of particular concern to Intel. The vulnerability they take advantage of has been present in nearly all Intel chips for the last 20 years. And while just about all processors found in smartphones, tablets, and PCs are vulnerable to the Spectre attack, few chips other than Intel's are at risk of the Meltdown attack.  Intel was notified of the attacks in June, but waited some seven months to disclose them. In between the company becoming aware of the processor security problems, and their public disclosure, Krzanich gained $24 million by selling all of the shares and options he was allowed to sell under his contract.  The company has said his stock sale was unrelated to the Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities, noting that it was done as part of a planned stock sale. But Krzanich put that plan in place just the month before \u2014 some five months after Intel became aware of the Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities.  Intel is facing some 35 lawsuits related to Spectre and Meltdown  Intel's handling of the disclosure of the exploits is now the subject of some 35 lawsuits, including a pair of shareholder derivative suits specifically related to Krzanich's stock sale.  Similar questions were raised about stock sales by Equifax executives made last year, in between the company becoming aware of a massive security breach and it disclosing that breach to the public.  It's unclear whether the SEC's new guidelines were prompted by either the Equifax or Intel security issues. The Justice Department is reportedly investigating the stock sales at Equifax. It's unclear whether the department or the SEC is investigating Krzanich's sale.  The guidelines don't represent new rules. Instead, they're essentially a clarification of existing ones. As such, the fact that the agency didn't issue them until Wednesday wouldn't bar it from investigating Krzanich's sale, even though that sale predated those guidelines.

Amid the scramble, Intel, the company most affected by the flaws, has seen its stock price slump.  But, as the company prepares to report earnings soon, one analyst thinks the company will be fine in the near term.  Watch Intel's stock price move in real time here.    Spectre and Meltdown, arguably the two biggest flaws ever found in modern computers, might not have a big impact on the near-term earnings of Intel, the company hit the hardest by the flaws.  At least, that's the thinking of John Pitzer, an analyst at Credit Suisse.  \"While our calendar first quarter estimates embed NO negative impact to revenue from the Meltdown/Spectre security issues \u2013 near term we would highlight that the uncertainty created could cause at least some calendar first quarter server/client purchases to be deferred as IT managers look for more clarity,\" Pitzer said in a note to clients.  Spectre and Meltdown are flaws in a technique modern CPUs use to speed up computing. There are three total variations of the two flaws, and Intel is the only company whose chips have been reported to be affected by all three. The company has seen its share price decline about 8.73% so far this year after the flaws were disclosed publicly.  Pizter previously released a report the day after the flaws were disclosed that claimed everyone was making \"mountains from molehills\" regarding the flaws. A lot of new information about the flaws has surfaced since then, but Pizter is holding his ground, saying Intel's near-term revenue largely won't be affected.  There have been confusing and conflicting reports around the flaws since their public disclosure, however. AMD, which is Intel's main rival in the space, initially said its hardware would not be affected by the flaws, and later reversed its stance. Nvidia, which makes GPUs, created confusion when it issued Spectre and Meltdown patches for its products which were thought to be impervious to the flaws. Nvidia later clarified that its patches were only precautionary, and its products are not affected.  Patches to fix CPUs affected by the flaws were initially thought to slow down certain programs by as much as 30%, and an exact impact on performance has yet to be determined. Pitzer said IT managers and big data centers could delay planned purchases of Intel chips until more clarity is found, and the long-term effects of the flaws for chipmakers won't be evident for some time.  If certain companies' chips are found to be faster than others after all the final Spectre and Meltdown patches have been issued, there could be a sector-wide shift to the faster chips, Pitzer said.  Pizter has a \"neutral\" rating on Intel, but said it's mostly because he thinks the company is too expensive right now, not because of the potential risks associated with Spectre and Meltdown.  Intel reports fourth quarter earnings January 25, and Pitzer thinks the results will fall in line with Wall Street's expectations. Pizter is expecting earnings per share of $0.86 on revenue of $16.3 billion.

Essentially this means that instead of sending data to the cloud for processing, it needs to be done right on the device itself because even a little bit of latency is too much.  Intel announced a new chip today, called the Intel Xeon D-2100 processor, to help customers who want to move computing to the edge. It\u2019s part of an effort by the chip giant to stay ahead of emerging technology trends like edge computing and the Internet of Things.  Computing at the edge has some unique space and power requirements that Intel has tried to address with this announcement. For starters, it provides a stand-alone system on a chip (SoC). This means everything you need is built into the chip including compute, networking and storage. It\u2019s also low power, which might be necessary to run an edge computing device without the benefit of a data center power structure.  In a blog post announcing the new chip, Jennifer Huffstetler, vice president and general manager of data center product management in the Data Center Group at Intel, pointed out the growing need for this type of architecture. \u201cBy expanding the capabilities of the data center outward to the network edge, solution providers can process more data closer to endpoint devices, reducing application latency and opening up a whole new world of potential services and experience,\u201d Huffstetler wrote.  She added that the SoC gives customers an \u201cintegrated, hardware-enhanced network, security and acceleration capabilities in a single package.\u201d The chip achieves all of this by packing a lot into a small package including up to 18 \u2018Skylake-server\u2019 generation Intel Xeon processor cores integrated with up to 100 Gbps of built-in cryptography, decryption and encryption acceleration. Intel calls this \u2018QuickAssist Technology.\u2019  The company sees this being particularly useful for new 5G technologies being developed for smartphones like augmented and virtual reality applications and autonomous driving. They also see it being useful for communications network use cases like virtual private networks and software-defined wide area networks and also certain cloud workloads that require processing close to the edge such as content delivery networks.  Intel has already built a partner network for the new chip with a variety of companies including Dell EMC, Ericsson, NEC, NetApp and Palo Alto Networks.  And if you\u2019re concerned about the impact of the Spectre and Meltdown exploits, Intel reports that it has built in the latest patches into the new chip.

That was a record year for Intel \u2014 and an annual increase of six percent \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t enough to stop Samsung from knocking it from the top spot, which Bloomberg reports it had occupied since 1992.  The writing was on the wall last year when Samsung beat Intel on a quarterly basis, but now it has held out for an annual win.  The change of position highlights Samsung\u2019s focus on mobile, and in particular memory chips which are an essential part of smartphones. Intel\u2019s chips may be in 90 percent of the world\u2019s computers, but it missed the mobile boom and is playing catch-up.  Overall, Samsung\u2019s entire business reported full-year profit of KRW 53.65 trillion ($50.7 billion) on revenue of KRW 239.58 trillion, $225 billion. For the final quarter of 2017, revenue was KRW 65.98 trillion ($62 billion) with KRW 15.15 trillion ($14 billion) in operating profit.  That\u2019s a higher profit but slightly lower revenue than the previous quarter. The company\u2019s mobile business actually saw its take-home drop by 3.2 percent year-on-year during Q4.  Looking ahead to 2018, Samsung said it intends to increase its chipset focus on cloud services, AI and automotive. On the smartphone front, where its name is best known among consumers, the company said it plans to adopt \u201ccutting-edge technologies\u201d like foldable displays.

Google Glasses never had a chance, and even the Snap Spectacles heyday has come to an end. But that\u2019s not stopping Intel from getting in on the fun.  The glasses are called Vaunt, first seen by the Verge, and they are nearly indistinguishable from regular glasses. Instead of some cumbersome headset with a special screen, Intel\u2019s Vaunt glasses are simple plastic frames that weigh under 50 grams (nearly the exact weight of Snap Spectacles). The smart glasses work with prescription and non-prescription lenses, and there is no camera equipped.  To any onlooker, you might just be wearing a pair of Warby Parkers.  But on the inside of the stems sits a low-powered class one laser, as well as a processor, an accelerometer, a Bluetooth chip and a compass.  This laser, which Intel says is \u201cso low-power that it\u2019s at the very bottom end of a class one laser,\u201d emits a red, monochrome image into your eye at 400 x 150 pixels.  The image might let you know it\u2019s someone\u2019s birthday, send notifications from your phone, or the glasses might detect that you\u2019re in the kitchen and send you a recipe. Because the laser is beaming directly into your retina, the image is always in focus.  While future models might be equipped with a microphone and access to smart assistants like Alexa or Siri, the first-gen Vaunt models will be controlled through subtle motion gestures like a nod of the head. Intel wants these glasses to fit into your life as naturally as possible.  While it\u2019s unclear just how the Vaunt glasses will come to market, Intel has said that the OEM route is a more likely strategy than Intel selling these specs themselves.  And, relatedly, Intel will be opening up the platform to developers with the launch of an early access program and SDK.  While it\u2019s unclear if a product like this has wings in the market, Intel\u2019s Vaunt currently represents the most promising version of \u2018smart glasses\u2019 we\u2019ve yet seen.

Of course, he also had to acknowledge the Spectre and Meltdown chip vulnerabilities revealed earlier this month in perhaps the ultimate good news-bad news moment.  Like any good salesman, Krzanich led with the good news. \u201c2017 was a record year for Intel and fourth quarter results were outstanding. Well ahead of the forecast we outlined in October, based on the strength on both our PC-centric and data-centric businesses.\u201d  Then came the not-so good news on Spectre and Meltdown, which he valiantly tried to sweep aside in his opening remarks. \u201cWe\u2019ve been around the clock with our customers and partners to address the security vulnerability know as Spectre and Meltdown. While we made progress, I\u2019m acutely aware that we have more to do, we\u2019ve committed to being transparent keeping our customers and owners appraised of our progress and through our actions, building trust,\u201d he said.  He added that the company is working on a more permanent solution for later this year. \u201cWe\u2019re working to incorporate silicon-based changed to future products that will directly address the Spectre and Meltdown threats in hardware. And those products will begin appearing later this year,\u201d he said.  For those of you not aware of Spectre and Meltdown, they are a series of serious chip vulnerabilities that affect many modern chips including Intel and its competitors. They could allow hackers to access the chip kernel, the area that is supposed to protect the most sensitive information like passwords and encryption keys.  What\u2019s more, the fixes to resolve, which have come in bunches from every corner of the tech world in recent weeks, could cause some significant computer processing slow-downs. It didn\u2019t help Intel\u2019s case that their first attempts at patching the issues were seriously buggy.  Nor did the fact that Google revealed that it had informed Intel In June 2017, months before it leaked out . In addition, Krzanich sold a substantial amount of stock in November, and filed the intent to sell long after he knew about the issue. Even though it was all legal, it certainly didn\u2019t look good.  In spite of all this, the fact is that Intel had a good quarter with revenue of $16.35 billion exceeding analyst\u2019s predictions, but that was for the period that ended 12/31/2017. The Spectre and Meltdown story broke on January 3rd.  Surprisingly only one analyst asked about the impact of Spectre and Meltdown on the company moving forward. Vivek Arya from Bank of America asked a question without mentioning the vulnerabilities by name. \u201cFor [the] first one, Brian, I\u2019m curious. Are you baking in any effect on sales of cost of pricing for many resolution on the processor security issues?\u201d Krzanich responded, \u201cFrom a cost standpoint, we\u2019ve baked in and we\u2019ve talked about that we don\u2019t expect any material impact of this security exploit on our spending or product cost or any of that. So that\u2019s how we baked that in.\u201d  It\u2019s worth noting that there are several lawsuits pending against Intel over the chip issues. Krzanich addressed that in his remarks. \u201cHowever, these circumstances are highly dynamic and we updated our risk factors to reflect both the evolving nature of these specific threats and litigation as well as the security challenge more broadly.\u201d  While acknowledging the obvious issues ahead, the company surprisingly doesn\u2019t see any substantial impact from the security problems. And in spite of all the negative news in recent weeks, the stock surged in after hours trading up $6.71 and was up slightly over that after the opening bell.  Whether Intel can escape from this unscathed financially remains to be seen, but at least for now Wall Street is not punishing the company for its transgressions, perhaps believing that Intel can resolve the chip security issues satisfactorily in the coming year.", "stock": "INTC"}, {"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/02/22/intel-lays-out-its-5g-plans-ahead-of-mobile-world-congress/", "label": 1, "source": "techcrunch", "date": "2018-02-22", "article": "The big story at last year\u2019s Mobile World Congress was 5G. This time out, however, we can expect a lot around 5G. And as for next year\u2019s show? Well, then we\u2019ll finally start talking about some 5G. Mobile infrastructure is a hard thing to make sexy, but it is, indeed, the future, and you can anticipate a lot more talk around the technology that will power the next generation of mobile devices at next week\u2019s big show in Barcelona.  We\u2019re still some days off from the actual event, and already Intel\u2019s showing off a little of what they\u2019ll be talking about at MWC. Perhaps somewhat ironically, the company will be using the world\u2019s biggest mobile show to show some of the work it\u2019s been doing on the PC side of the spectrum \u2014 but then, this is Intel, after all.  The chip maker will be using the event to debut some early demos of its forthcoming 5G-enabled two-in-one devices. Not a lot in the way of specifics around the devices at the moment, but Intel\u2019s been partnering with most of the biggest names in the Windows device space, including Dell, HP, Lenovo and, naturally, Microsoft, with a goal of bringing products to market by the end of 2019.  Those systems will be powered by the XMM 8060, the 5G modem the company announced back in November. Given the timeline here, it\u2019s no surprise, really, that these are still firmly in the \u201cconcept\u201d phase. In a call this week, Intel\u2019s Group President and Chief Engineering Officer Murthy Renduchintala told TechCrunch that managing the hype cycle around 5G is still a balancing act.  \u201cIt\u2019s always a balance between talking about the evolution of the present and the future,\u201d Renduchintala said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s got that down to a science, Intel included. What we\u2019re trying to do is a give a vision of how the experiences going forward are going to continue to transform what people can expect from a scenario of total mobility.\u201d  Phones will, naturally, lead the way for commercially available 5G products. And Intel will be the first to admit that it missed the boat on mobile with regard to the 4G explosion. In our conversation, Renduchintala repeatedly refers to the company as an \u201cunderdog.\u201d It\u2019s still a little jarring when referring to a company that pulled in $62 billion in 2017, but it\u2019s not entirely inappropriate when discussing the race to 5G.  \u201cIt\u2019s important that we can attest to the resilience and fortitude of ambitions when people ask us questions about why they should take Intel seriously now when they\u2019ve only faltered in the past?\u201d Renduchintala asks, rhetorically. \u201cIntel, to some degree in the past, has been characterized by maybe needing to talk a little less and be a little more. To be the underdog and surprise people with the capability and the precision of what we can deliver in 5G.\u201d  Phones will certainly be a part of the company\u2019s play. In a blog post this morning, Intel points out that it is looking to make an aggressive push into the ever-growing China market. \u201cTo expand our entry into the China phone ecosystem, Intel and Unigroup Spreadtrum and RDA have established a multi-year collaboration to develop a portfolio of 5G products for mobile platforms, combining Intel 5G modems with Spreadtrum application processor technology.\u201d  Though, the company continues to have a formidable opponent in Qualcomm. No one knows better than Renduchintala, who spent a dozen years at the Southern California mobile chip giant.  \u201cI have every reason to believe Qualcomm will continue to be exemplary in its execution and delivery of world-class solutions,\u201d Renduchintala explains. \u201cI do think Intel will be a formidable and very meritorious competitor to Qualcomm in this space. On the modem and technology side, we\u2019re going to be investing and executing on a level where we think we can give Qualcomm an extremely competitive environment. I clearly see us as someone who is seen as the underdog.

Terms of the deal haven\u2019t been disclosed. McAfee said that it plans to integrate TunnelBear\u2019s technologies into the company\u2019s own VPN product, Safe Connect.  The TunnelBear team will also keep working on TunnelBear products under its own brand. According to the announcement, TunnelBear was a profitable company.  You might remember that Intel acquired McAfee back in 2011. Intel even rebranded the company to Intel Security. But the company was spun out a couple of years ago. McAfee is now an independent company again, and this represents McAfee\u2019s second acquisition after breaking up with Intel.  TunnelBear has been providing a paid VPN service with desktop and mobile apps. For $4.99 to $9.99 per month, you can connect to one of TunnelBear\u2019s servers so that people sharing the same Wi-Fi network can\u2019t look at your data packets, or so that you can access restricted websites if you\u2019re in China for instance.  There are some good things to say about TunnelBear. When it comes to TunnelBear\u2019s privacy policy, the company seems to respect your privacy. But TunnelBear is based in Canada, which could be an issue if you\u2019re trying to avoid intelligence services.  Now that McAfee owns TunnelBear, the VPN service will have to comply with U.S. laws. You should also keep an eye on terms of service and changes in the privacy policy after the acquisition.  TunnelBear is also one of the only companies that have completed a security audit with a third-party company. The full report says that there isn\u2019t any critical security issue with TunnelBear\u2019s service. But the report hides medium and low vulnerabilities.  Many VPN companies pretend to care about your privacy but you can\u2019t know for sure. I\u2019m glad companies like TunnelBear are setting a good example and I hope more companies will follow that path.  More generally, you shouldn\u2019t trust any VPN company because the risks are too high. A VPN provider can basically see everything you do on the internet. Some of them analyze your browsing habits, sell data to advertisers, inject their own ads on non-secure pages and collaborate with local authorities.  You could install HTTPS Everywhere and build your own VPN for instance.

The Series D was led by Intel Capital, and it is a strategic investment. As part of it, Mobileye, the $15.3 billion Intel subsidiary that builds autonomous driving solutions, will be partnering with Moovit to incorporate its data into Mobileye\u2019s navigation system.  (And as part of it, significantly, Professor Amnon Shashua, Senior Vice President of Intel and CEO / CTO of Mobileye, is joining Moovit\u2019s Board of Directors as an observer.)  Others in the round included all of the startup\u2019s previous investors: Sequoia, BMW iVentures, NGP, Ashton Kutcher\u2019s Sound Ventures, BRM, Gemini, Vaizra, Vintage, as well as another new investor, Hanaco.  The plan will be to use the funding to expand the company\u2019s tech and business development.  \u201cMoovit expects to surpass 1 billion users by 2021 and to expand significantly the number of cities that use Moovit\u2019s data analytics to improve urban mobility,\u201d said Nir Erez, the co-founder and CEO, in a statement. \u201cWe are especially thrilled about our plans to collaborate with Mobileye. It\u2019s a synergistic relationship at an exciting time to be shaping the future of urban mobility.\u201d  To date, Moovit has raised around $131 million in funding, and while it\u2019s not revealing its valuation, in its last round in 2015 it was valued at $450 million, and given its growth since then (it only had 15 million users at the time, versus 120 million today), it\u2019s very likely that the valuation now is well above $500 million post-money. We\u2019ll be asking Erez when we speak to him later, to see if we can shed more light on that front.  The deal comes at an interesting time in the navigation and mapping space. Citymapper, a mapping and transit navigation app based out of London, has been testing out different ideas to figure out how to monetise its service. One of the latest developments is building its own transportation offering using buses and taxis \u2014 although it will have a lot of pre-existing competition, including city\u2019s own services and heavily capitalised startups like Uber.  Meanwhile, we\u2019re also seeing ever more companies looking to get in on the act. In addition to public and private transit services, there are automakers like GM and Ford (which itself has its own growing pains), and tech companies that also want to bring their AI-based systems into the fray. Alexa for autos, in fact, is just today adding its first mapping services, by way of a partnership with Mapbox, to go head to head with Google Maps and Apple\u2019s Maps.  Moovit is taking a different tack, in that regard, by striking commercial deals that will bring its data and analytics \u2014 by way of its Smart Transit Suite \u2014 into other services that are getting used in autonomous vehicles and other smart, connected cars. This suite is based around a data-in-data-out principle: Moovit partners with municipalities and transit operators to bring in their data to help them manage their networks as well.  Similarly, this will give Mobileye one more application to enhance its own service and offering to car makers. \u201cWith significant investments in automated driving, mobility management platforms and smart infrastructure, Intel is at the forefront of a fundamental transformation of urban mobility,\u201d Shashua said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re working with some of the most innovative transit companies, municipalities and transit authorities to build critical foundational technologies for this transformation.\u201d", "stock": "INTC"}, {"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/03/10/qualcomm-vs-broadcom/", "label": 1, "source": "techcrunch", "date": "2018-03-10", "article": "Game of Thrones may be out of season, but the complex and multi-dimensional strategic drama at the heart of the acclaimed series can still be witnessed in today\u2019s ongoing showdown between Broadcom and Qualcomm. This week, we even had a character \u201cdeath\u201d of one of the \u201croyals\u201d to boot.  For those who have not been paying attention to this epic match, Singapore-domiciled Broadcom has been running a proxy battle with U.S.-based Qualcomm for the past few months, a process that Qualcomm has put enormous efforts into resisting. The two companies are among the most important producers of semiconductors and mobile chipsets, and their combined market value would be in the hundreds of billions of dollars.  Mega-mergers happen occasionally, and hostile takeovers are also not rare. What makes Qualcomm vs. Broadcom unique though is the incredible amount of chess playing that is taking place not only by the two companies, but other companies and governments as well in a simultaneous strategic game for tech domination. Today, I want to highlight a series of those moves from this week, and what those moves portend going forward.  Intel\u2019s nuclear option  Intel is the second largest chipmaker in the world, having recently fallen behind Samsung as Jon Russell noted this January. Intel dominates the chipsets for personal computers, but it has struggled mightily to build an inventory of products targeting smartphones.  That gap has allowed companies like Qualcomm to dominate the market for smartphone chipsets, with recent reports indicating that the company receives 42% of all revenue from the market, with Apple trailing at 20% of the market and MediaTek with 14%. Intel has been barely a blip, which is why it announced just before Mobile World Congress a few weeks ago that it was going to invest heavily in 5G wireless technology going forward.  Today, Qualcomm and Huawei are the technology leaders in the emerging 5G market. While Intel has not executed well in wireless chips in the past, there is a plausible path forward for the company to compete with these two leaders and potentially earn itself a profitable spot at the top of the market.  However, Broadcom\u2019s potential takeover of Qualcomm could vastly complicate such efforts. Broadcom and Qualcomm\u2019s combined market cap could be ahead of Intel\u2019s $244 billion valuation, and if Broadcom were to sell off 5G assets to Huawei (a major point of contention here that is definitely not final), then Intel might have to compete with a deeply-resourced Huawei, a battle it would likely not win.  Intel is gearing up to launch what might be dubbed the nuclear option: a complete buyout of Broadcom. The Wall Street Journal reported on rumors Friday that Intel would take such a move, which would massively dwarf the company\u2019s previous largest acquisition of Altera for $16.7 billion. As the WSJ wrote, \u201cIntel is watching the takeover battle closely and is eager for Broadcom to fail [at acquiring Qualcomm] as the combined company would pose a serious competitive threat, the people said.\u201d  So now we have Intel expending all energy to block Broadcom\u2019s bid for Qualcomm, and also Intel considering a pre-emptive, $109 billion (at minimum!) price for Broadcom to prevent the tie-up if it absolutely had to. That\u2019s some very expensive chess moves right there for all of the companies involved.  Singapore, China and the United States enter the fight  Okay, so a company starts to get involved in an M&A process to prevent their competitors from merging and transforming into a more formidable opponent. That\u2019s pretty standard fare, but where the multi-dimensionality of this acquisition war starts to really become visible is the extent to which national governments are intervening to control the outcome.  The United States is doing the most here, through a government committee known as CFIUS, or the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (for those who missed my primer on CFIUS last week, definitely take a read). CFIUS is designed to protect U.S. national security by regulating foreign acquisitions of American companies, and therefore has taken a keen interest in the Broadcom vs. Qualcomm struggle.  In an extraordinarily rare public letter (the committee\u2019s thinking is almost always secret), CFIUS published its preliminary negative outlook on the hostile takeover. Quoting a key paragraph at length:  \u201cReduction in Qualcomm\u2019s long-term technological competitiveness and influence in standard setting would significantly impact U.S. national security. This is in large part because a weakening of Qualcomm\u2019s position would leave an opening for China to expand its influence on the 5G standard-setting process. Chinese companies, including Huawei, have increased their engagement in 5G standardization working groups as part of their efforts to build out a 5G technology. For example, Huawei has increased its R&D expenditures and owns about 10 percent of 5G essential patents. While the United States remains dominant in the standards-setting space currently, China would likely compete robustly to fill any void left by Qualcomm as a result of this hostile takeover. Given well-known U.S. national security concerns about Huawei and other Chinese telecommunications companies, a shift to Chinese dominance in 5G would have substantial negative national security consequences for the United States.\u201d  Broadcom has been trying to replace most of Qualcomm\u2019s board of directors, with a shareholder vote scheduled for this past week on March 6th. CFIUS asked that the vote be postponed 30 days in order for it to have more time to comprehensively evaluate the national security implications of the proposed transaction.  Originally, I and other analysts thought that CFIUS was responding to pressure from Congress to act unilaterally on the proposed deal. What we have learned though is that Qualcomm\u2019s board had secretly asked CFIUS to review the transaction on January 29th this year.  In other words, Qualcomm is using America\u2019s regulatory authority as a potential weapon to thwart Broadcom\u2019s bid and protect itself. It\u2019s a brilliant maneuver, and also fairly unprecedented: CFIUS is usually only engaged once both parties to a transaction have finalized a deal and submitted it for review.  China has its own regulatory weapon to fight back though. While dealing with the proxy battle with Broadcom, Qualcomm has also been trying to finalize its acquisition of NXP Semiconductors, which has been going on for a year now. It raised its offer price two weeks ago to $44 billion, an offer that looks like it is increasingly acceptable to NXP shareholders.  There\u2019s just one hang up: China\u2019s chief regulatory body overseeing the transaction, the Ministry of Commerce or MOFCOM, has yet to approve the deal, and it is the only international trade regulator that hasn\u2019t assented. Some M&A analysts are now saying that the approval process could be extended, not just as a response to CFIUS-related concerns, but also due to Trump\u2019s newly proposed steel and aluminum tariffs.  As I mentioned before, China-based Huawei and Qualcomm are the two market leaders for 5G. Harming Qualcomm then would fundamentally benefit Chinese interest, which is why China is also playing the economic security chess game.  Finally, we get to the Singapore connection. Despite having a majority of its employees and office space in North America according to an NYT Dealbook analysis, Broadcom is domiciled in Singapore, which makes it a foreign company in the eyes of CFIUS. Broadcom has floated a proposal to redomicile to the United States, which would potentially make it exempt from CFIUS (though there is serious debate on this point). CFIUS is clearly worried about losing jurisdiction, because it demanded Broadcom give the committee five business days notice before taking action on redomiciling.  Broadcom is taking action though, since it announced yesterday that it would ask shareholders to approve of a redomicile plan on March 23rd, and it disclosed that it had already discussed the plan with the Singapore courts at a hearing on March 9, which would have to approve the plan. So Singapore also has some regulatory leverage in the game as well, which is all the more complicated since it sits between China and the U.S. on many of the national security issues at the heart of this battle.  The demise of a \u201croyal\u201d and the future  If your head isn\u2019t spinning at all of these dynamics, add in one more: Qualcomm is struggling to overcome a malaise that has hit its share price over the past several years. Qualcomm\u2019s board can\u2019t just ignore Broadcom\u2019s offer, given that the premium being offered today is roughly 50% above its share price from before the proxy battle started.  The Qualcomm board announced this week that executive chairman Paul Jacobs, the former CEO of the company and the son of company founder Irwin Jacobs, would step down and the role eliminated. Jeffrey Henderson, a board director appointed by activist hedge fund Jana Partners, will become chairman of the board. The proxy battle has hit at the heart of the founding family of the company, and is clearly starting to take a more personal toll.  In a battle with so many actors and interests at stake, it is hard to prognosticate on what the outcome here is going to be. My analysis is that the Trump administration is going to attempt to maintain jurisdiction over the merger regardless of Broadcom\u2019s redomicile process, and will likely end up negative on the deal although it may not outright block it. Qualcomm also seems increasingly warm to offers from Broadcom to buy the company, and Qualcomm\u2019s desire to consummate a deal would certainly move the process more quickly forward.  Expect more hijinks and chess moves in the coming weeks as the final stages of this fight reach their crescendo. The season finale of this battle is still far away.", "stock": "INTC"}, {"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/03/15/intel-announces-hardware-fixes-for-spectre-and-meltdown-on-upcoming-chips/", "label": -1, "source": "techcrunch", "date": "2018-03-15", "article": "When the Spectre and Meltdown bugs hit, it became clear that they wouldn\u2019t be fixed with a few quick patches \u2014 the problem runs deeper than that.

Of course, the efficacy of those updates is debatable, as well as their performance hits \u2014 and that\u2019s if your hardware vendor even gets a patch out.

Variant 1 is arguably the most difficult of them all to fix, and as such Intel doesn\u2019t have a hardware solution for it yet \u2014 but variants 2 and 3 it has in the bag.  \u201cWe have redesigned parts of the processor to introduce new levels of protection through partitioning that will protect against both Variants 2 and 3,\u201d Krzanich writes. Cascade Lake Xeon and 8th-gen Core processors should include these changes when they ship in the second half of 2018. Although that\u2019s a bit vague, we can be certain that Intel will prominently advertise what new chips include the mitigations as we get closer to release.  Lastly, even older hardware will be getting the microcode updates \u2014 back to the 1st-gen Core processors. Remember Nehalem and Penryn? Those will be patched in time, as well. Anyone surprised that a Nehalem system is still in use anywhere probably hasn\u2019t worked in IT at a big company or government agency.

The bipartisan committee offered a set of measures to defend domestic election infrastructure against hostile foreign nations.  Before launching into the findings from its committee-wide examination of current practices, written up in an accompanying report, the group emphasized that states are \u201cfirmly in the lead\u201d in conducting elections, although the federal government should work closely to provide funds and information.  Although there are many factors that can mitigate the risk to U.S. elections, election equipment itself, particularly internet-connected systems, remains a core concern in the report:  States should rapidly replace outdated and vulnerable voting systems. At a minimum, any machine purchased going forward should have a voter-verified paper trail and no WiFi capability. If use of paper ballots becomes more widespread, election officials should re-examine current practices for securing the chain of custody of all paper ballots and verify no opportunities exist for the introduction of fraudulent votes.  Because financial need varies from state to state, the committee recommended legislation that would create a grant program through which states could apply for election security funds, including the funding needed to conduct system audits.  \u201cStates should use grant funds to improve cybersecurity by hiring additional Information Technology staff, updating software, and contracting vendors to provide cybersecurity services, among other steps,\u201d the report states.  The rest of the report focused on how to bolster U.S. election infrastructure and practice against foreign attacks. Now that the potential vulnerability of U.S. election systems is widely known, Russia may not be the only adversary looking to poke holes in U.S. systems.  \u201cIt may not be the Russians next time,\u201d Senator James Lankford said. \u201cThey have set a pattern that others could follow.\u201d That means that Iran, North Korea or even domestic hacktivist groups could be following along.  The committee recommends that the U.S. work with allied countries to create international cyber standards to deter hostile nations from taking advantage of current gray areas in cyber policy, making it clear that attacks on election systems are \u201chostile acts.\u201d  \u201cWe need a more transparent cyber doctrine so that other nation-states are on notice,\u201d New Mexico Senator Martin Heinrich said.  The committee made multiple mentions of the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s failure to coordinate with states \u2014 and state-level distrust of that department \u2014 during the 2016 election. In the past, information sharing between federal and state officials has been hampered by slow processes for obtaining the proper security clearances for state and local election workers.  \u201cThe Intelligence Community should work to declassify information quickly, whenever possible, to provide warning to appropriate state and local officials,\u201d the report states.  States also lag behind when it comes to knowledge and implementation of basic cybersecurity best practices like two-factor authentication.

The memo in fact undermined some Republicans\u2019 efforts to cast doubt on the roots of the investigation by confirming that the inquiry was already underway before law enforcement officials presented the Steele information in obtaining the warrant to conduct surveillance on Mr. Page.  On Sunday, several Republicans on the Intelligence Committee distanced themselves from Mr. Trump\u2019s statements.

The people familiar with the Democratic document say that it reveals that while the F.B.I. did not name the Democratic National Committee and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign as having funded the Steele research, the bureau disclosed to the court that the information it had received from him was politically motivated. That, the Democratic memo says, gave the judge in the case the information he needed to make a decision about its usefulness.  The memo is also said to argue that Republicans distorted the testimony by Mr. McCabe, the F.B.I. official, and left out reams of other evidence included by the F.B.I. to support the bureau\u2019s suspicions that Mr. Page was acting as an agent of Russia. Mr. McCabe in fact presented the material as part of a constellation of compelling evidence that raised serious suspicions about Mr. Page, a former Moscow-based banker who had been on the F.B.I.\u2019s radar for years, according to those familiar with the memo.

But most observers believe that it is only a matter of time before Chinese factories catch up to those at industry leaders in the United States, South Korea and Taiwan.  \u201cThey are very conscious that they still have a long way to go,\u201d said Dieter Ernst, a senior fellow at the East-West Center, a research and educational organization based in Honolulu. \u201cBut they also know that in semiconductors, they are by far the most important market for American companies.\u201d  One stumbling block for China: Attempts to scoop up foreign chip makers mostly have not worked out. State-owned Tsinghua Unigroup tried to buy Micron Technology, a memory chip maker based in Idaho, for $23 billion in 2015, but regulatory worries scuttled the deal.  The Trump administration last year blocked a China-backed investor from buying Lattice Semiconductor, an Oregon-based manufacturer. And regulatory concerns scotched a Chinese investment group\u2019s plan to buy Xcerra, even though the Massachusetts-based company makes chip-testing equipment and not chips themselves.  In Washington, concern about the emerging rivalry with China has been reflected in a number of recent reports, from the likes of the Pentagon and the Department of Energy, that warn about the country\u2019s growing tech capabilities. Still, shorter-term considerations could mean that Washington would back down before Beijing in an all-out trade war.  \u201cIf the markets take a nose-dive as we move closer to the midterm elections,\u201d Mr. Kennedy of the Center for Strategic and International Studies said, \u201cthat would put some pressure on Trump to look for face-saving solutions, even if final problems haven\u2019t been addressed.\u201d", "stock": "INTC"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/11/dining/what-to-cook-this-week-newsletter.html", "label": 1, "source": "the-new-york-times", "date": "2018-03-11", "article": "Photo  Good morning!

The debate receded when the Trump administration took office, but in recent months top officials like Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, and Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, have begun talking publicly about the \u201cgoing dark\u201d problem.  The National Security Council and the Justice Department declined to comment about the internal deliberations. The people familiar with the talks spoke on the condition of anonymity, cautioning that they were at a preliminary stage and that no request for legislation was imminent.  But the renewed push is certain to be met with resistance.  \u201cBuilding an exceptional access system is a complicated engineering problem with many parts that all have to work perfectly in order for it to be secure, and no one has a solution to it,\u201d said Susan Landau, a Tufts University computer security professor. \u201cAny of the options people are talking about now would heighten the danger that your phone or your laptop could be hacked and data taken off of it.\u201d  Craig Federighi, the senior vice president of software engineering at Apple, stressed the importance of strengthening \u2014 not weakening \u2014 security protections for products like the iPhone, saying threats to data security were increasing every day and arguing that it was a question of \u201csecurity versus security\u201d rather than security versus privacy.  \u201cProposals that involve giving the keys to customers\u2019 device data to anyone but the customer inject new and dangerous weaknesses into product security,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWeakening security makes no sense when you consider that customers rely on our products to keep their personal information safe, run their businesses or even manage vital infrastructure like power grids and transportation systems.\u201d  But some computer security researchers believe the problem might be solvable with an acceptable level of new risks.

While it largely described challenges to solving the problem, one section cited presentations by several technologists who are developing potential approaches.  They included Ray Ozzie, a former chief software architect at Microsoft; Stefan Savage, a computer science professor at the University of California, San Diego; and Ernie Brickell, a former chief security officer at Intel.  Photo  According to several people familiar with the new round of deliberations, those three men have been participating in a series of workshops convened at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Daniel Weitzner, a computer science professor. They have discussed their research with government officials, including Valerie Cofield, a senior F.B.I. science and technology official working on \u201cgoing dark\u201d issues.  The researchers, Mr. Ozzie said, recognized that \u201cthis issue is not going away,\u201d and were trying to foster \u201cconstructive dialogue\u201d rather than declaring that no solution is possible.  Mr. Savage said the talks had focused on trying to create a safe enough way to unlock data on encrypted devices, as opposed to the separate matter of decoding intercepted messages sent via encrypted communications services, like Signal and WhatsApp.  Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Data in motion and the cloud are much harder to deal with.\u201d  The deliberations shed new light on public remarks by Trump administration officials in recent months. In October, Mr. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, argued in a speech that permitting technology companies to create \u201cwarrant-proof encryption\u201d was endangering society.  \u201cTechnology companies almost certainly will not develop responsible encryption if left to their own devices,\u201d he said. \u201cCompetition will fuel a mind-set that leads them to produce products that are more and more impregnable. That will give criminals and terrorists more opportunities to cause harm with impunity.\u201d  And Mr. Wray, the F.B.I. director, has twice given speeches this year in which he pointed to Symphony, an encrypted messaging system for banks. Pushed by a state regulator, several banks agreed to give copies of their Symphony keys to law firms. Because Symphony keeps a copy of encrypted data on its servers, that arrangement created a backup means for investigators to gain access to the messages if necessary.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  \u201cAt the end, the data in Symphony was still secure, still encrypted, but also accessible to the regulators so they could do their jobs,\u201d Mr. Wray told a cybersecurity conference in Boston this month. \u201cI\u2019m confident that by working together and finding similar areas to agree and compromise, we can come up with solutions to the \u2018going dark\u2019 problem.\u201d  The Symphony approach, however, would not work for millions of ordinary smartphone users. But one alternative being worked on by Mr. Ozzie and others is receiving particular attention inside the government.  The idea is that when devices encrypt themselves, they would generate a special access key that could unlock their data without the owner\u2019s passcode. This electronic key would be stored on the device itself, inside part of its hard drive that would be separately encrypted \u2014 so that only the manufacturer, in response to a court order, could open it.  Law enforcement officials see that idea as attractive in part because companies like Apple are already trusted to securely hold special keys permitting them to push operating system updates to devices like iPhones.  Still, Ms. Landau argued that creating such a system would create significant additional security risks. She noted, among other things, that updates are relatively rare but police would want seized phones opened every day \u2014 so many more tech company employees would need access to the powerful new keys, increasing the risk of theft or abuse.  The Obama administration never agreed on asking for legislation mandating access mechanisms. Military and cybersecurity agencies worried that weakening security would create new problems, and commerce officials worried about quashing innovation and making American tech products less competitive.  Still, in 2016, the Obama administration\u2019s deliberations also came to focus on the idea of access keys on devices, a participant said, but stalled because of difficult technical questions about the details. They included how to prevent criminals from deleting the access keys on their devices or from using phones that do not have the mechanism because they run on outdated software or were built for foreign markets.  But one Justice Department official familiar with the deliberations contended that it might not be necessary to come up with a foolproof system, arguing that a solution that would work for ordinary, less-savvy criminals was still worth pursuing.  Mr. Brickell, the former Intel official, echoed that view. Enforcing compliance with a rule that devices must have access mechanisms to function \u201cis a difficult problem,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s keep working on it.

Ms. Sanders referred questions about the security clearance process \u2014 and why Mr. Porter was allowed to continue working at the White House for so long despite the abuse accusations \u2014 to the F.B.I. and the intelligence agencies, saying they are the ones that handle the background checks and the granting of permission to handle classified information.  \u201cIt\u2019s up to those same law enforcement and intelligence agencies to determine if changes need to be made to their process,\u201d she said.  The F.B.I. had no comment on Monday.  The finger-pointing has frustrated Democratic members of Congress, who have pushed to gain visibility into the security clearance procedure at the White House.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina and the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, has refused to ask the White House for any information about security clearances or for a formal briefing on the matter, Democrats on the panel said Monday. He has also refused to allow the committee to vote on three subpoenas proposed by Democrats, including one on interim clearances.  Mr. Gowdy\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment.  In a letter sent last week, Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the top Democrat on the committee, pressed Mr. Gowdy to more aggressively tackle the security clearance issue, saying that news of Mr. Porter\u2019s problems had given the matter renewed urgency.  \u201cIf you had agreed to any of our previous requests for information on these matters, the White House would have been required to answer key questions about why Mr. Porter was denied a final security clearance,\u201d Mr. Cummings wrote.  \u201cInstead, because of your multiple refusals, we did not find out about any of these issues until they were reported in the press,\u201d he added.  The process for allowing White House officials to work with secret, classified material typically begins when West Wing employees are subjected to a brief background check and are granted interim clearance. A full background check by the F.B.I. and, in some cases, the C.I.A. then begins.  Officials with previous administrations said it is not uncommon for the full background checks to take as long as eight months or a year, in part because of a long backlog in vetting the backgrounds of people needing clearance across the federal government.  Video  Background checks take about a year for Pentagon employees and six to seven months for prospective C.I.A. or National Security Agency workers, a senior American official said.  But several former White House officials said it is also common for administration officials to encourage the investigators to give top priority to senior presidential aides like Mr. Porter and Mr. Kushner.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  What Mr. McGahn and other top White House officials learned about the allegations against Mr. Porter, and when they learned it, remains murky.  Mr. Porter told Mr. McGahn in January 2017 that there could be what he described as false allegations against him, according to two people briefed on the situation. In June, the F.B.I. informed the White House security office that allegations of domestic abuse had surfaced. Mr. McGahn was made aware at the time that there was an issue with Mr. Porter\u2019s background investigation, but relied on the security office to continue pursuing the background check.  White House officials disputed that assertion, saying on Monday that Mr. McGahn was not made aware during the summer of any problems with Mr. Porter\u2019s clearance.  In November, the bureau delivered a thick file on Mr. Porter\u2019s background check to the security office and relayed that he was not likely to succeed in getting a permanent clearance, according to one person briefed on the case. Security office officials encouraged the F.B.I. to complete its investigation so the office could make a final determination on Mr. Porter\u2019s clearance.  One person briefed on the situation, who had insisted on anonymity to discuss private deliberations, said late last week that the bureau had informed Mr. McGahn when the file was delivered that the allegations against Mr. Porter were likely to derail his security clearance. But on Monday, the person said that he had been mistaken, and contended that Mr. McGahn had not learned of the F.B.I.\u2019s communications to the security office until much later.  In Mr. Kushner\u2019s case, a final decision about a permanent security clearance is also still pending.  Mr. Lowell said that it should not be surprising that someone with \u201cthe extent of his holdings, travels and lengthy submissions\u201d would require a lengthy background check. But he took issue with the suggestion that the delays somehow affect Mr. Kushner\u2019s ability to do his job at the White House.  \u201cThis is just the latest,\u201d he said, \u201cin unnamed sources quoting secondhand hearsay concerning Mr. Kushner that, like the others, will be shown to be untrue.\u201d", "stock": "INTC"}, {"url": "https://www.techradar.com/reviews/intel-optane-800p-ssd", "label": -1, "source": "techradar", "date": "2018-03-08", "article": "The Intel Optane SSD 800P could have been a tour de force with its promising 3D XPoint technology, but it\u2019s ultimately hamstrung by tiny capacities and a hampered interface.  Intel unleashed unbelievably fast Optane 900P SSDs earlier this year but, to our chagrin, they\u2019re not exactly affordable at $369 (\u00a3329, AU$559) for the smallest, 280GB drive. Not to mention 900P drives don\u2019t come in the easy-to-install and ubiquitous M.2 form factor \u2013 instead, they\u2019ve only been available as a beefy PCIe card or U.2 drive.  So, enter the Intel Optane SSD 800P drives. These drives pack the same 3D XPoint technology that makes the 900P series so blazing fast into a far smaller package. Plus, these gum stick-sized SSDs start at a more affordable price, albeit with much, much smaller capacities, with 58GB running for $129 (about \u00a390, AU$165) and $199 (about \u00a3140, AU$255) for 118GB.  While these drives should be just as fast as the company\u2019s flagship enterprise drives, poor decisions to limit its maximum bandwidth, capacity and performance \u2013 no to mention a still high asking price \u2013 make them hard recommend for anyone.  Features  Whereas the Intel Optane SSD 900P was introduced as a high-end storage solution, the Intel Optane SSD 800P was announced as mainstream storage for use as a primary \u2013 or operating system boot \u2013 drive.  However, we find it tough see ourselves using a 58GB SSD as our main drive. Even if we were to RAID two 118GB drives together for a total of 236GB, it seems puny compared to the other 256GB SSDs we could pick up for half the price and far less complexity.  The Intel Optane SSD 800P\u2019s headline feature should be 3D XPoint, which is designed to deliver 1,000 times the performance, 1,000 times the speed, and 10 times the capacity of traditional NAND.  Unfortunately, the tiny capacities in which you can buy an Optane SSD 800P don\u2019t really support Intel\u2019s claims. Speed-wise, these drives are also limited by a PCIe 3.0 x 2 interface that can only achieve up to 1,450MB/s and 640MB/s sequential read and write speeds, respectively.  That\u2019s half as slow as the speeds we see from other mainstream NVMe drives, such as the Samsung 960 Evo or Intel\u2019s own 760p Series SSD .  Image 1 of 6 Image 2 of 6 Image 3 of 6 Image 4 of 6 Image 5 of 6 Image 6 of 6  Performance  In our standard battery of storage benchmarks, the Optane SSD 800P falters behind many other drives. Unsurprisingly, the drive\u2019s sequential read and write speeds are half of other drives utilizing PCIe 3.0 x 4 interface. This leaves us to conclude there\u2019s an intrinsic connection between the halved performance and using only half as many PCIe lanes.  Surprisingly, the Intel Optane SSD 800P achieves some of the best random write speeds we\u2019ve seen, though, once again random read performance leaves us wanting.  Intel claims that its newest mainstream drive is most effective at operating with low queue depth. (If you\u2019ve never heard of the phrase before, queue depth refers to the number of read or write operations a volume of storage can handle at the same time.)  However, our simple file transfer tests show that this really isn\u2019t the case. The Intel Optane SSD 800P takes almost the longest to complete a 10GB file transfer compared against Intel Optane SSD 900P, Intel 760p and Samsung 960 Evo. It fares better when moving a 10GB folder, but you\u2019re still looking at paying much more for this drive that doesn\u2019t perform significantly better.  Final verdict  In the end, we\u2019re at a loss as to who the Intel Optane SSD 800P would be ideal for. To even get a decent amount of storage, you would have to buy two 118GB drives for $199 (about \u00a3140, AU$255) each \u2013 then go through the trouble of arranging them into a RAID.  Meanwhile, most \u2018mainstream\u2019 users would get more storage, a cheaper price and better performance by going with a 256GB Intel 760p Series SSD for $109 (\u00a3113, AU$169) or 250GB Samsung 960 Evo for $119 (\u00a3129, AU$189).  With competition so fierce in the M.2 NVMe world of SSDs, there\u2019s no truly compelling reason to consider the Intel Optane SSD 800P for your PC.", "stock": "INTC"}, {"url": "https://www.techradar.com/reviews/intel-hades-canyon-nuc", "label": -1, "source": "techradar", "date": "2018-03-29", "article": "Intel\u2019s \u2018Next Unit of Computing\u2019 hardware platform has always showcased some of the chipmakers most interesting silicon concepts. This year, the Hades Canyon NUC represents a partnership between Intel and AMD we would have never expected \u2013 or even fathomed.  It\u2019s easily the smallest VR-capable PC that marries together an Intel quad-core processor with integrated, \u2018discrete-class\u2019 AMD Radeon RX Vega graphics into a single chip. With all that power under its belt, this gaming PC easily smashes through Full HD gaming with most modern titles and performs like a productivity champ.  Despite all the caveats of that comes with a barebones computer such as this, the Intel Hades Canyon NUC earns top marks for packing so much performance into a small package. It\u2019s one of the best and our favorite mini PC of the year so far.  Spec Sheet Here is the Intel Hades Canyon NUC configuration sent to TechRadar for review: CPU: 3.1GHz Intel Core i7-8809G (quad-core, 8MB Cache, up to 4.2GHz)  Graphics: Radeon RX Vega M GH graphics (4GB HBM2 VRAM), Intel UHD Graphics 630  RAM: Kingston HyperX 16GB DDR4 (3,200MHz)  Storage: 118GB Intel Optane SSD 800P Series (NVMe), 512GB Intel SSD 545s Series (M.2 SATA)  Ports (front): 1 x USB-C 3.1 Gen 2, 1 x USB-A 3.1 Gen 2, 1 x USB-A 3.1 Gen 1, SD card reader, HDMI 2.0a  Ports (rear): 2 x Thunderbolt 3 (USB-C), 4 x USB 3.0, HDMI 2.0a, 2 x mini DisplayPort, 2 x Ethernet, optical audio out  Connectivity: Intel Wireless-AC 8265, Bluetooth 4.2  Weight: 2 pounds (0.91kg)  Size: 8.7 x 5.6 x 1.54 inches (22.1 x 14.2 x 3.9cm; W x D x H)  Price and availability  Our particular Intel Hades Canyon NUC8i7HVK review unit costs $999 (about \u00a3710, AU$1,302), which is about half-to-a-third off the price of an equally competent gaming laptop . Not too shabby for a PC equipped with a quad-core Intel Core i7 and nearly Nvidia GTX 1060 equivalent graphics.  That said, this barebones unit doesn\u2019t come with storage, memory or an operating system, so you\u2019ll have to get those pieces on your own.  There\u2019s also an entry-level Intel Hades Canyon NUC8i7HNK priced at $799 (about \u00a3570, AU$1,040). This more affordable NUC comes still comes with a quad-core i7 CPU, but it maxes out at a slower frequency. Meanwhile, the onboard Radeon RX Vega M GL GPU has four fewer compute units and won\u2019t run as fast either.  Compared to other barebone PCs, the high-end Intel Hades Canyon NUC compares well against the $949 (\u00a3619, AU$1,739) Zotac Zbox Magnus EN1060K and $999 (\u00a3819, AU$1,579) Gigabyte Brix GB-BNi7HG6-1060. Both of these mini PCs feature older Kaby Lake processors but a Nvidia GTX 1060 with two more GB of video RAM and higher CUDA  Image 1 of 6 Image 2 of 6 Image 3 of 6 Image 4 of 6 Image 5 of 6 Image 6 of 6  Design  At first blush, the Hades Canyon NUC looks more like a set top box than a desktop PC, and that\u2019s honestly a good thing. The device is interesting enough to look like more than just a plain box in your home entertainment setup while also not being too distracting if you decide to use it as your work computer.  If you remember the Skull Canyon NUC Intel released two years prior, the Hades Canyon should look very familiar. Both units share the same overall shape, plus an identical hexagonal motif for the ventilation holes and top panel. Of course, with the integration of \u2018discrete-class\u2019 graphics and sufficient cooling to back it up, Intel\u2019s flagship NUC is almost twice as large as its predecessor.  Intel\u2019s design has also seen some improvements. The old interchangeable plastic panels have been replaced by a much slicker light-up skull fashioned after the silicon that resides within. The lighting on this part of the case and all the little hard drive and power indicators are fully customizable \u2013 or you could just turn them all off for a stealthy unit.  Despite this PC\u2019s small size, it packs an impressive amount of ports. Along the backside alone you\u2019ll find four USB 3.0 ports, two ThunderBolt 3 ports, two mini DisplayPorts, HDMI 2.0 and even two Gigabit Ethernet ports. That\u2019s more connectivity than you\u2019ll even find on some full-size desktops.  Cracking open the Hades Canyon NUC is a breeze, as it just requires undoing six torx screws and a single Philips head. With the top cover removed, you can access the computer\u2019s memory slots as well as the M.2 NVMe and SATA drives.

We can play all our favorite games, including Far Cry 5 and Warhammer: Vermintide 2, at a steady 60 frames per second (fps) with high-quality graphical settings and a 1080p resolution.  Even more impressive is that the little PC holds it own through Overwatch and Hitman at 1440p with HDR active on a Samsung CHG70 QLED gaming monitor. The only title to give us some measurable difficulty is Assassin\u2019s Creed Origins, but it still runs at a completely playable 40fps with high quality settings and a 1080p resolution.  Outside of gaming, the Intel Hades Canyon NUC runs like a champ through all our regular web browsing and word processing, as well as our image and video editing needs. For those multi-monitor fans, the Intel Hades Canyon NUC can also drive up to six screens.  Compared to comparable notebook hardware in the 15-inch Microsoft Surface Book 2 , the Intel NUC almost wins the complete race in both processor and graphically intensive tests. A full-on gaming laptop like the Dell Inspiron 15 7000 Gaming manages to close the gap a little better, but for the most part the Hades Canyon stays on top.  Meanwhile, a gaming PC with actual desktop parts, like the Asus ROG G20CI , proves to be tougher competition. While the NUC manages to score better in the processor tests, the integrated graphics just can\u2019t keep up with a Nvidia GTX 1080 \u2013 then again, neither could the AMD Radeon RX Vega 64 .  Final verdict  The Intel Hades Canyon NUC is the company\u2019s most impressive mini PC yet, capable of playing most modern games with ease and offering plenty of performance for everyday computing. And, that\u2019s all without the help of an external GPU, unlike the previous Skull Canyon NUC.  This is true high-end desktop computing on a single, standalone chip. Beyond this one device, it represents a turning point for thin-and-light laptops like HP Spectre x360 15 and Dell XPS 15 2-in-1 to be just as powerful as full-on gaming laptops  Although the Hades Canyon NUC might be expensive and require additional parts, you won\u2019t find another mini PC as powerful as this. The expansive array of ports and support for high-end internal components is equally as amazing. Thanks to its small size, it's also the perfect home theater PC.  All in all, Intel has produced an incredibly tiny and VR-capable gaming PC worthy of your attention and consideration.", "stock": "INTC"}, {"url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/intel-is-building-a-graphics-card-team-potentially-for-discrete-gaming-gpus", "label": 1, "source": "techradar", "date": "2018-04-11", "article": "Intel's re-entry into the world of dedicated graphics cards almost seems inevitable and now there are at least three reports that seem to back up the theory.

If you can\u2019t imagine wearing Magic Leap goggles or a Microsoft HoloLens visor in public, then Vaunt may be the AR solution you\u2019re looking for.  The last quasi-mainstream smart glasses were Google Glass , which spawned story after story of \u201cGlassholes\u201d using the built-in camera to record people without permission, or gesturing wildly in front of nonplussed bystanders.  Unlike other smart glasses, which rely on outward-facing cameras and motion or touch controls, Vaunt gets rid of these features entirely. Intel\u2019s New Design Group (NDG) is instead relying on a mixture of voice controls, AI, head motions and lasers to make Vaunt hands-free.  Read on the latest news and speculation on the release date, price and potential features of the Intel Vaunt augmented reality glasses.  Cut to the chase  What is it? Augmented reality smart glasses made by Intel  Augmented reality smart glasses made by Intel When is it out? There's no consumer release date yet, but an early access program is launching later this year for developers  There's no consumer release date yet, but an early access program is launching later this year for developers What will it cost? No pricing details yet, but Google Glass cost $1,500 (\u00a31,000, about AU$1,589), to give you an idea  Image credit: Vjeran Pavic/The Verge  The official developer kit will launch \u201clater this year\u201d, but Intel remains cagey on a specific date, according to The Verge .  An earlier report by Bloomberg cited sources who claimed the company plans to sell a majority stake in Vaunt to a company with solid expertise in sales channels, industry or design, rather than sell Vaunt directly to consumers.  Depending on how long this partner search takes and any tweaks that may happen as a result, this could delay Vaunt\u2019s general release date. Still, this is unlikely to stop developers from getting their hands on the first version before the year is out.  Intel Vaunt price  Intel also hasn\u2019t revealed any Intel Vaunt price information yet. Snap Spectacles only cost $130 / \u00a3105 / AU$170, while the Google Glass SDK was priced at $1,500 (\u00a31,000 / about AU$1,956).  Where Vaunt falls depends in part on how much the proprietary Vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) costs, compared to the built-in cameras found on most AR devices. Unlike its competitors, Vaunt's hardware appears to be pretty minimal, since it can fit comfortably in plastic frames.  The Verge\u2019s Dieter Bohn , who got a first look at Vaunt, speculated that the device may rely on streaming content from apps based in the cloud, or from your smartphone via Bluetooth, to run its software. This could keep hardware requirements, as well as prices, low.  We\u2019ll keep our eyes out for the latest info from Intel, but we\u2019re fairly confident predicting the price will be significantly lower than that of the Magic Leap One or HoloLens. While there's no price yet for the Leap One, the HoloLens costs $3,000 (\u00a32,719 / AU$4,369).  How it works  Vaunt's low-power laser shoots into your retina (Credit: Vjeran Pavik/The Verge) (Image: \u00a9 Vjeran Pavic/ The Verge)  With most AR glasses, people around you can clearly see if you\u2019re checking notifications or watching YouTube during a meeting. With Vaunt, the interface is nearly invisible to everyone except the wearer.  That\u2019s because Vaunt uses a low-intensity laser to reflect your notifications directly into your right eye\u2019s retina \u2014 except only in your peripheral vision, so it doesn\u2019t impair your sight. The Vaunt will connect with both iOS and Android devices to pull the wearer\u2019s notifications, similar to a smartwatch.  The designers intend wearers to be able to glance quickly into the bottom right corner of their eyesight and check for news and texts, without having to visibly pull out a phone or glance at their wrist.  The laser is a VCSEL \u2014 the same laser used by the iPhone X to scan your face for Animoji and Face ID \u2014 and one that Intel\u2019s NDG promises is too weak to cause any retinal damage. The laser reflects off of the right lens, beaming a 400 x 150 pixel image onto the retina.  Because the image sits directly on your eye, near- or far-sighted users can see the text as clearly as someone with 20-20 vision. Of course, these users will still need prescription lenses in their Vaunts to see the outside world clearly.  The plastic frames house the laser on the right and the Bluetooth, processor, and other tech on the left, so the weight is balanced. The frames weigh about 50 grams, which is slightly heavier than regular frames; by comparison, we weighed Google Glass at 42 grams.  Intel Vaunt features  The red dot in the right eye is allegedly only visible at certain angles (Credit: Vjeran Pavik/The Verge)  Right now, Intel is keeping the Vaunt\u2019s potential features strictly hypothetical. But Itai Vonshak, head of products at NDG, described some potential use cases.  A baker could ask Alexa to pull up a cookie recipe. While on the phone with your mom, a calendar pop-up will remind you that her birthday is coming up. Or, a pedestrian could stare at a restaurant and, based on their GPS position and direction they\u2019re facing, receive a Yelp pop-up with reviews \u2014 without any vocal or touch commands.  Vaunt\u2019s AI will also be able to track subtle head movements and respond to certain commands, via a built-in accelerometer. And Intel has hinted that final models could have built-in mics to communicate with voice assistants.  Of course, we haven\u2019t seen how these features would work in practice yet, and the Yelp example sounds particularly difficult to pull off. But NDG claims their AI will be able to send users all sorts of \u201cambient, contextual information\u201d based on their position and directional gaze without the user having to actually ask for it.  \u201cIf you\u2019re tapping and fiddling\u201d to get information, Vonshak tells The Verge, \u201cthen we\u2019ve lost\u201d.  Later this year, developers will be invited to an early access program to start working with the Vaunt directly. Intel is currently working on its first-party companion app, but the indication seems to be that most apps will probably run on connected smart devices, not to your glasses directly.", "stock": "INTC"}, {"url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/intel-8th-gen-cpus-with-baked-in-meltdown-protection-to-land-later-in-2018", "label": -1, "source": "techradar", "date": "2018-03-15", "article": "As the company has previously indicated, Intel has redesigned its 8th-generation processors to make them bulletproof to Meltdown and one variant of Spectre at a hardware level.

Kaby Lake was particularly noteworthy because it was behind many of the best laptops and desktop PCs of 2017, like the Dell XPS 13 and the MacBook Pro. Kaby Lake took the world by storm.  Sadly, Kaby Lake has been a confusing generation, even to the most tech savvy among us. This is mainly because Intel abandoned its longstanding \u2018tick-tock\u2019 generational model where it would alternate between optimizing the architecture of the best processors and shrinking their manufacturing process each year. Instead, Intel has released the 7th and 8th-generation Kaby Lake CPUs as the third and fourth generations using Intel\u2019s 14nm process, respectively.  Intel followed the 7th-generation Kaby Lake CPUs by releasing its 8th-generation Kaby Lake R CPUs for laptops. Intel has also recently implemented hyperthreading capabilities in its Core i3 processors for notebooks.  In October 2017, Kaby Lake R CPUs were succeeded by 8th-Generation Coffee Lake H-series CPUs, which are bringing intensely powerful 6-core, 12-thread Core i9 processors to a laptop near you.  Kaby Lake was also victim to the Spectre and Meltdown exploits, but Intel says a fix is on the way.  If all of this sounds confusing, don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ve taken the time to write up everything you need to know about Intel Kaby Lake \u2013 from price to availability to the range of processors available.  Cut to the chase  What is it? Intel's 7th- and 8th-generation Core processors  Intel's 7th- and 8th-generation Core processors When is it out? Now for both desktops and laptops  Now for both desktops and laptops What will it cost? Ranges from $42 (\u00a339, AU$66) to $350 (\u00a3415, AU$469)  After Kaby Lake released back in 2016, we saw PC makers as reputable as HP, Dell and Lenovo launch their own Kaby Lake-packed laptops and PCs. Even though it used to be considered the standard for Intel processors in early 2017, Kaby Lake has since been succeeded by Kaby Lake Refresh and Coffee Lake.  If you\u2019re thinking, \u201cWait, isn\u2019t Coffee Lake the name of Intel\u2019s 8th-generation architecture?\u201d, you would be right, although the Santa Clara chipmaker has come out and said that it plans on releasing three different CPU architectures under the 8th-gen umbrella, namely Kaby Lake Refresh, Coffee Lake and Cannon Lake.  If you\u2019re confused, you\u2019re not alone. Intel apparently had to \u201creimagine what \u2018generation\u2019 means\u201d, according to Tom\u2019s Hardware. Regardless, what you need to know here is that Kaby Lake Refresh is coming to laptops and Ultrabooks near you, while Coffee Lake is focused on desktops.  Cannon Lake, on the other hand, will be here later, most likely in the latter half of 2018.  Kaby Lake revealed CPUs  Outside of mobile, there are well over 20 Kaby Lake chips now on the market. From the Celeron G3930 to the Core i7-7700K, practically all the choices you had last generation are still present, albeit with better power efficiency and even a slight spec boost.  The Core i7-7700K is the flagship processor this time around, unlocked for overclocking as indicated by the discrete \"K\" moniker. Like the generations before it, the Kaby Lake architecture opts for a numerical naming convention: it consists of the \u201c7\u201d series CPUs to Skylake\u2019s generation 6, Broadwell\u2019s gen 5 and so on.  However, Intel is trying something with Kaby Lake that\u2019s practically unprecedented. By refreshing its 7th-generation processors with more cores, better clock speeds and improved graphics, the company has been able to create an entirely new generation out of its Kaby Lake processors as well, hence the Core i7-8550U being used in the new HP ProBooks .  As far as Intel\u2019s 7th-gen mobile processors are concerned, the most powerful lie in the \u201cH\u201d series, consisting mainly of the Intel Core i7-7700HQ and the Intel Core i7-7820HK. The former can be found in the 15-inch MacBook Pro while the latter is featured predominately in high-end gaming notebooks like the Alienware 17 R4 .  At Intel\u2019s low- to medium-power range, there\u2019s the Core i7-7500U, which initially leaked alongside the i7-7700K, but has since been found in the HP Spectre x360 as well as the Razer Blade Stealth . Intended for Ultrabooks on the top-end, this is a relatively high performance chipset, but still belongs to the \"U\" ultra-low voltage family.  Meanwhile, Intel\u2019s 8th-generation Kaby Lake processors marked the debut of quad-core processors for Ultrabooks. These include the top-end Intel Core i7-8550U, which operates at a base clock speed of 1.8GHz and a boost speed of 3.7GHz. As for the graphics, you can expect integrated UHD Graphics 620 from Intel.  Further on the mobile front, the higher-end Core m5 and m7 mobile chips of the past are now being interspersed into the Y-series Intel Core family. These include the Core m3-7Y30, the Core i5-7Y54 and the Core i7-7Y75, which are being used in top-end laptops with fanless and convertible designs to complement the more power-hungry U-series processors.  Many of Intel\u2019s 7th- and 8th-generation selections also support Optane, a memory technology that brings hard drive speeds up to par with that of SSDs.  Intel Kaby Lake first laptops  Where have these chipsets ended up? Well, they\u2019re currently featured in a long list of notebooks, several of which we\u2019ve already reviewed. The aforementioned Razer Blade Stealth and HP Spectre x360 are joined by the likes of the Lenovo Yoga 720 among many other Ultrabooks, 2-in-1s and full-on laptops.  The MacBook Pro , too, has been given the Kaby Lake treatment, though our review of that model is pending. Because the \u201cH\u201d series Kaby Lake processors typically used in the 15-inch MacBook Pros weren\u2019t available at the time of its release, Apple\u2019s late 2016 laptops were still clinging to Skylake up until being hastily refreshed at WWDC 2017 .  Other laptops equipped with Kaby Lake processors include the new 2-in-1 Dell Latitude 7285 featuring WiTricity magnetic wireless charging and the acclaimed Samsung Notebook 9 Pro convertible laptop. Plus, there are even more Kaby Lake-based laptops expected just around the corner, like the Surface Book 2 .  Intel Kaby Lake architecture  Cannonlake is likely to prove a much more exciting update than Kaby Lake and even Coffee Lake thereafter. You see, Kaby Lake is very similar to the Skylake family we're already using. This is not what we originally expected of the Skylake successor, but Intel has changed how its processor development works.  Since 2007, Intel has worked in a 'tick, tock' rhythm of upgrades, where one generation shrinks the die, followed by a generation that alters the architecture. That changed this year. As of 2016, Intel now uses a \"Process, Architecture, Optimization\" approach, and Kaby Lake represents that last, frankly least interesting stage.  It's still a 14nm processor that\u2019s fairly similar to Skylake throughout, and the desktop variants will use the same LGA 1151 socket. Unless something goes terribly wrong, Cannonlake will shrink Intel CPUs down to the long-promised 10nm die in 2018.  While there are some performance improvements in store, it seems unnecessary for those with a Skylake CPU to upgrade to a Kaby Lake processor of the same level. That said, there are more options this time around, with higher end Kaby Lake-X CPUs making an impression.  Intel Kaby Lake upgrades  Despite not being the most thrilling generation of processors, there are some distinct improvements that inhabit Intel\u2019s Kaby Lake CPUs. The first is fully integrated support for USB-C Gen 2. Skylake machines can offer this already, but need an extra third-party piece of hardware. Now, its \u201cnative\u201d. Again, not exciting, but it is necessary.  Gen 2 USB 3.1 enables bandwidth of 10Gbps, rather than 5Gbps. Thunderbolt 3 support is in, too. In a similar vein, HDCP 2.2 support is native in Kaby Lake. This digital copy protection is a newer version designed for certain 4K video standards. Ultra HD Blu-ray is the key one, though 4K Netflix on Windows 10 also requires a Kaby Lake processor.  That\u2019s right, Kaby Lake also offers integrated GPUs better-suited to 4K video. Thanks to a new media engine built on a Gen9 graphics architecture, users can edit real-time 4K video using nothing more than integrated graphics. For video consumption, the new VP9 and HVEC 10-bit decode will enable all-day 4K video streaming on a single charge.  And then to build on top of that dedication to better integrated GPUs, Intel has announced Kaby Lake G series CPUs that will feature integrated AMD Vega graphics to further push into a high-definition future.  Better yet, Intel\u2019s 8th-gen processors bring integrated UHD Graphics, designed to enhance the playback of 4K video. As a result, an Ultrabook using 8th-gen chips can display across three 4K monitors at once or even power a Windows Mixed Reality headset. It should also be noted that 8th-generation Kaby Lake processors are said to be 40% faster than their 7th-gen counterparts.  Kaby Lake only officially supports Windows 10 among Microsoft\u2019s operating systems. This is yet another attempt by Microsoft to push those lingering on Windows 7, or anything a little older, into the present.  Apollo Lake: Kaby Lake's poor cousin  It's also worth considering the low-end Atom chipsets you'll see used in very cheap laptops, Windows 10 tablets and low-power mini PCs Intel calls NUCs (Next Unit of Computing). Although they\u2019re not part of Kaby Lake, the latest \u201cApollo Lake\u201d chips started to appear in late November, with Asus and HP being among the first to implement them.  These, too, are capable of 4K video playback acceleration by way of the HEVC and VP9 codecs. This is due in part to the move from Gen 8 to the Gen 9 graphics found in Skylake processors.  Kaby Lake-X: a higher-end future  If you're only interested in mainstream Kaby Lake models, the future isn't looking too complicated. They're trickling out, before being replaced by Cannonlake CPUs in late 2018. However, the outlook for seriously high-end hardware is more convoluted.  As of a couple of months ago, the newest high-end CPUs were part of the Broadwell-E series, even though among mainstream processors Broadwell is already old news. But in June, Intel released its more powerful Skylake and Kaby Lake \u201cX\u201d series processors, the latter of which comes in two flavors:  4.0GHz quad-core Intel Core i5-7640X (up to 4.2GHz with Turbo Boost)  4.3GHz quad-core Intel Core i7-7740X (up to 4.5GHz with Turbo Boost)  Both of these bear TDP ratings of 112 Watts in addition to supporting quad-channel DDR4-2666 memory. They\u2019re still built on the same 14nm manufacturing node as less \u201cX-treme\u201d Kaby Lake chips, but they\u2019re very obviously geared towards gamers seeking a \u201cgreat VR experience,\u201d as all of Intel\u2019s marketing materials would suggest.  What mere mortal laptop and desktop buyers need to take from Kaby Lake, though, is that a.) we'll see even more machines using the new chipsets very soon and b.) unless you don\u2019t want to upgrade to a new motherboard, you might want to see if 2017\u2019s Intel Coffee Lake will serve your needs better.

Tokyo 2020 will also see smart city applications and allow athletes to gain access to eHealth technologies and data analytics that will boost performance.  The official supplier for the games is Japanese operator NTT DoCoMo, which plans to launch a commercial 5G network in 2020.  Also speaking at MWC, NTT DoCoMo CEO Kazuhiro Yoshizawa said its plans for 5G were well underway and it was confident that 5G could help create new services and tackle social issues. The Olympics could be the killer app that convinces people they need the faster speeds, lower latency and higher capacity that 5G affords.  \u201cMany people questioned the necessity when we introduced 3G and 4G but as it turns out, the adoption of social media and streaming expanded rapidly to become a \u2018must have\u2019 for many people\u2019s lives,\u201d he said.  \u201cBack then the network rolled out first and services came out late. With 5G we want people to use new services from day one. The network and services will launch at the same time.\u201d  Yoshizawa used his keynote address to stress the need for the creation of an ecosystem that would stimulate innovation and said its programme had so far attracted interest from more than 600 partners.  \u201cThings that were previously difficult because of the limitations of 4G are now possible,\u201d he concluded.

It has been edited for content to reflect details related to the Middle East launch of Intel's new processors.  Intel is poised to continue its dominance of the mobile computing world in 2018 with the release of new Coffee Lake H-series and U-series Intel Core processors, Core i9 CPUs for laptops, and Intel Optane taking over mobile memory.  All three new types of product are designed to give Intel what it needs to deliver top-tier performance for every laptop price point, purpose and form factor \u2013 and based on Intel\u2019s promises and early hands-on time with several of these 8th-generation and Core i9 laptops, Intel seems well on its way to delivering.  Starting with the fun stuff, Intel Core i9 brings the firm\u2019s most powerful CPU into the mobile space. The one and only Core i9 processor is the i9-8950HK, clocked at 2.9GHz and maxing out at 4.8GHz across its six cores and 12 threads. The processor has a relatively massive 12MB cache, and is unlocked for overclocking.  Clearly, the idea with this processor is to bring desktop, hexa-core power to gaming laptops and prosumer devices. Laptops we\u2019ve seen already that possess this power include the Asus ROG G703, Dell XPS 15 (2018) and MSI GT75 Titan.  Image 1 of 8 Acer Aspire Nitro 5  Sporting a faux carbon fiber lid, the Acer Nitro 5 will be one of the more affordable Intel 8th-gen H-series laptops available starting this month. Image 2 of 8 Acer Aspire 7  Meanwhile, Acer's more business facing Aspire 7 brings the same level of performance to a more professional device plus higher-tier Nvidia GTX 1050 Ti graphics. Image 3 of 8 MSI GS65 Stealth  The MSI GS65 is fresh, more minimalistic take on the brand's classic Stealth series featuring an even thinner chassis and smaller bezels. Image 4 of 8 MSI GT75 Titan  On the opposite end of the portability equation, the MSI GT75 Titan is one of the first of three gaming laptops to feature an Intel Core i9 processor for true overclocking potential.

Image 7 of 8 HP Omen 15  The HP Omen 15 is not only of the brands first laptops to feature a hexa-core Intel Core processor, but also a Nvidia GTX 1060 Max-Q GPU. Image 8 of 8 HP Omen 17  Featuring the same choices in processors, the HP Omen 17 also sports a larger 17.3-inch screen.  Better performance for all  Unlike the laser focus on enthusiast gaming of Core i9 on mobile, Intel looks for its Coffee Lake H- and U-series to improve upon the experiences of all gamers and general users, respectively.  The H series of Intel Core processors brings hexa-core design to Intel Core i7 chips for the first time in the i7-8850H with a 2.6GHz clock speed that boosts to 4.3GHz when needed with a 9MB cache in tow. These hexa-core CPUs should make managing multiple units in strategy and other similar games much more efficient.  Intel\u2019s Coffee Lake U-series, however, simply doubles down on the power of 8th-gen Kaby Lake R with more quad-core chips that range in clock speed from 2.3GHz to 3.0GHz and cache size from 4MB to 8MB.  By Intel\u2019s measure using a Core i7 8th generation processors are 88% better in performance compared to a three year old system. The new U-series also integrates updated Iris Plus graphics.  To make those gains feel even greater, Intel has brought its Optane high-speed memory to laptops through both direct Optane SSDs, like the Optane SSD 800p, as well as Optane hybrid drives for disk drives paired with SSDs. According to Intel, the gains amount to 1.3x performance improvement in data writing and retrieval-related tasks, and 4.7x faster level loading in games.  Intel hasn\u2019t laid out pricing expectations for any products containing these new processors or storage improvements, leaving that up to individual device makers. Expect to see laptops with these new processors inside laptops very soon.", "stock": "INTC"}, {"url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/how-intels-core-i9-processors-will-inject-desktop-grade-power-into-future-laptops", "label": 1, "source": "techradar", "date": "2018-04-10", "article": "When we first heard of Intel\u2019s H-series Coffee Lake processors for laptops, we had a hunch it would include some of company\u2019s first hexa-core CPUs. But, we never expected Core i9 to make the jump to laptops .  On desktops, high-end processors, like the Intel Core i9-7980XE , have brought the highest-core counts we\u2019ve seen on consumer chips and the greatest multi-core performance we\u2019ve tested.  In similar fashion, the top-of-the-line chip boasts a six-core and 12-thread arrangement for the first time on a mobile part, with the addition of higher clock speeds up to 4.8GHz, thanks to its fully unlocked status. Intel claims that its Core i9-8950HK is the best gaming and content-creation laptop processor it has ever built. Even amongst its 8th generation H-series brethren, this top-end part is claimed to deliver at least 10% more performance than the second-most powerful Intel Core i7-8850H.  Of course, there\u2019s always a greater story behind any legendary leap forward such as this, and Fredrik Hamberger, general manager of premium and gaming notebooks at Intel, is excited to tell all.  \u201cWe saw the demand from our highest-end enthusiasts for more performance,\u201d Hamberger says, explaining the origins of the first mobile Core i9 processor. \u201cThey wanted something more, different and higher-end than just what we were scaling with our entire category.\u201d  \u201cSo, we looked at that and we had an opportunity to squeeze a little more out of our process and by doing some unique things, like Thermal Velocity Boost.\u201d  Thermal Velocity Boost will require the best cooled notebooks  Going into overdrive  Just what is Thermal Velocity Boost (TVB) anyway? It\u2019s basically a feature that allows Intel\u2019s top-end processor to achieve an additional 200MHz of additional frequency on top its standard 4.6GHz Turbo Boost.  \u201cBy taking advantage of the fact that, at lower temperatures, you can actually achieve higher frequencies,\u201d Hamberger explains, \u201cwe\u2019ve done some tweaking to our process and microcode to enable an additional boost in frequency when the processor temperature allows. \u201c  Like most of Intel\u2019s Turbo Boost technology, Thermal Velocity Boost turns on automatically applies the 200 extra megahertz of additional frequency as long as a workload \u2013 such as a video encode or rendering 3D models \u2013 requires it and the chip is operating at 50-degrees Celsius or lower.  As Hamberger explains it, TVB is centered around burst workloads rather holding a sustained overclock for tasks such as gaming.  \u201cAs the part heats up, you might drop down to only 100MHz of additional frequency and when it reaches something above 70- or 80-degrees Celsius you might not get that any additional speed,\u201d Hamberger says.  Still, you can expect the chip to operate at its guaranteed turbo boost frequency of 4.6GHz up to 100-degrees Celsius. Any hotter than that, and you\u2019ll most likely have other problems on your hands.  Bringing desktop power to laptops  Following our talks with Intel, it is abundantly clear that the ultimate goal of its new Intel Core i9 chip is to bring the power of desktops to the laptop. The concept isn\u2019t exactly new to the mobile space: over the years, we\u2019ve seen plenty of manufacturers implement desktop processors into gaming laptops , such as the Origin EON15-X .  Intel, being the actual maker of the processors, wasn\u2019t about to just ramshackle a desktop-level part into a notebook. Rather, it engineered a chip completely designed for mobile with a thermal design and power delivery that notebooks could support.  \u201cWe saw the wish for power and performance and that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to deliver, giving them as much as we can in a mobile-friendly form factor,\u201d Hamberger tells us. \u201cYou get that better form factor, battery life and tuning that you wouldn\u2019t get with a socketed part in a notebook chassis.\u201d  \u201cIf you look at what we did with our highest-end performing SKU. The Core i9 is on par with last year\u2019s desktop chip.  The thinnest Intel Core i9-powered laptop  For the most part, Hamberger sees musclebook \u2013 a new phrase Intel has coined for thicker workstations and gaming notebooks \u2013 users being able to take the full advantage of Core i9\u2019s overclocking capabilities as they offer a higher level of cooling, allowing for TVB to kick in more often. That said, there will also be thinner laptops capable of supporting Intel\u2019s highest-end chip, such as the Dell XPS 15 .  \u201cIt\u2019s also going to show up in the sub 20mm category that has thinness and greater battery life than six hours,\u201d he says.  If you look at the history of silicon in computers, there\u2019s always been a trickle-down effect, especially in Intel\u2019s case. Intel Core i9, and the greater Core X series, brought server capability into a desktop format with megatasking.  Now, Intel Core i9 brings the performance of a desktop and server-borne megatasking to notebooks, all within the company\u2019s first hexa-core processors for laptops. Here\u2019s to hoping the trend continues and we see mobile CPUs with eight or more cores in the near future.", "stock": "INTC"}, {"url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/intel-coffee-lake-s-8-core-processors-will-land-later-this-year-3dmark-leak-teases", "label": -1, "source": "techradar", "date": "2018-03-21", "article": "If you\u2019ve been holding out for Intel to finally meet AMD head-on with core-crammed PC processors for the mainstream, Coffee Lake won\u2019t disappoint you this year. Both VideoCardz and WccfTech have found evidence of octa-core Intel Coffee Lake S processors slated for post-June release.  Reportedly uncovered through leaks in benchmarking software maker Futuremark\u2019s 3DMark database, not much is known about these processors beyond base clock speeds, which could change, and the vastly more important core count. If all pans out, you\u2019re looking at Intel Coffee Lake S processors capable of driving eight cores at a 2.2GHz frequency with what appears to be a 16MB cache.  Of course, neither the processor\u2019s test scores nor more specific information is available at this time. Regardless, this is an excellent sign of Intel\u2019s intent to compete with AMD in the high-end mainstream processor space for gamers and other hobbyist consumers with money to burn.  Intel\u2019s no stranger to the core craze, but in mainstream?  Last year, we definitely saw Intel release an 18-core beast of a processor in the Core i9-7980XE , but that was based on Intel\u2019s larger 22nm architecture, as well as its X299 chipset and motherboard series, and cost nearly thousands.  On its more modern 14nm process, Intel was only able to get as far as hexa-core processors in 2017, led by the award-winning, Z370-based Core i7-8700K for more than a thousand less. While that was able to trounce AMD Ryzen \u2019s best in our tests, Intel clearly isn\u2019t about to let that momentum die out.  That\u2019s what makes this finding so significant, that octa-core Intel processors are within reach of prospective PC builders for prices that, while still exorbitant, aren\u2019t prohibitively so. However, it's expected that these new processors will be compatible only with the upcoming Intel Z390, also featured within this database leak \u2013 so it'll likely be a bit pricier to get in on these processors than just the cost of the chip.

At the time, they were billed as an evolution of the previous, 7th-generation chips, bringing quad-core designs to the i5 line and therefore more power.  However, these chips have also been said to boost efficiency when it comes to power consumption.  That said, let\u2019s say you\u2019re at the local computer store. In an aisle littered with choices, you\u2019ve narrowed it down to one laptop, but there are two models side-by-side. One is housing an Intel Core i7 Kaby Lake (last year\u2019s 7th-generation) processor, and another a Core i7 Kaby Lake R (this year\u2019s 8th-generation).  With the chance to save, say, $100 (or \u00a3100) in this case, how much more would you really be getting out of that most up-to-date model to make that extra cost worthwhile?  We\u2019ve tested this real-life dilemma with three versions of the same Acer Swift 3 laptop \u2013 one with a 7th-gen Intel Core i5, one with an 8th-gen Intel Core i5 and one with that same chip and Nvidia MX150 graphics installed \u2013 to demonstrate.  As it turns out, the differences are rather striking in some areas and rather negligible in others.  Performance Benchmarks PCMark 8 Home  7th-gen Core i5: 2,791  8th-gen Core i5: 3,278  8th-gen Core i5 (MX150): 3,203 Geekbench 4  7th-gen Core i5: 3,911 Single-Core; 7,654 Multi-Core  8th-gen Core i5: 4,168 Single-Core; 14,009 Multi-Core  8th-gen Core i5 (MX150): 3,994 Single-Core; 13,557 Multi-Core Cinebench  7th-gen Core i5: 327 CPU; 49 Graphics  8th-gen Core i5: 530 CPU; 52 Graphics  8th-gen Core i5 (MX150): 512 CPU; 90 Graphics CPU-Z  7th-gen Core i5: 324.3 Single-Thread; 925.8 Multi-Thread  8th-gen Core i5: 402.7 Single-Thread; 1993.2 Multi-Thread  8th-gen Core i5 (MX150): 397.4 Single-Thread; 1928.4 Multi-Thread  Performance  When it comes to pure computing power output, there\u2019s little doubt that the 8th generation of Intel Core is stronger than the 7th. For instance, we see here that the 8th gen all but spanks the previous in Geekbench 4\u2019s multi-core CPU test.  The same is made obvious by our Cinebench and CPU-Z benchmark results: the leap from dual-core in the 7th generation to quad-core in the 8th generation is enormous.  In practical use, an 8th-gen machine will render multiple streams of data far faster than the previous generation, so expect smoother video and complex image editing from such a device.  However, we\u2019ve noticed interesting differences between the 8th-gen model without Nvidia graphics and the one that\u2019s housing an MX150 graphics chip.  In almost all of these aforementioned tests, the model without dedicated graphics outperformed the one with Nvidia graphics.  According to Intel, these differences amount to \u2018unit-to-unit variations\u2019 within a margin of error of 2% to 3%.  All in all, we\u2019re seeing a 17% (in PCMark 8 Home) to an 83% (in Geekbench 4) to as much as a 115% (in CPU-Z) increase in throughput between generations. That\u2019s certainly nothing to scoff at for a difference in price of 100 to 200 bills.  Battery Benchmarks PCMark 8 Battery Life  7th-gen Core i5: 4 hours and 25 minutes  8th-gen Core i5: 4 hours and 26 minutes  8th-gen Core i5 (MX150): 4 hours and 14 minutes TechRadar Battery Test  7th-gen Core i5: 6 hours and 58 minutes  8th-gen Core i5: 7 hours and 25 minutes  8th-gen Core i5 (MX150): 7 hours and 32 minutes  Battery life  That said, when it comes to longevity, the latest Intel processors don\u2019t enjoy nearly as incredible of an increase, but it\u2019s at least a boost. In short, don\u2019t expect all-day battery life just because you splurged on the model with the latest processor.  In the PCMark 8 Battery Life test, we\u2019re seeing gains so small that they\u2019re within the margin of error (and proof that dedicated graphics a long-lasting laptop does not make).  In our local video playback test, however, the 8th-gen model lasted nearly 30 minutes longer, while the one with Nvidia graphics lasted more than 30 minutes longer.  Of course, Intel never made a big stink about increases in lasting power when it rolled out Kaby Lake R late last year.  Just don\u2019t splurge on an 8th-generation Intel Core processor within a laptop model versus one with the previous version on account of battery life solely.  So, how much better is Kaby Lake R?  Unsurprisingly, 8th-generation Intel Core, or Kaby Lake R, is better than the previous generation Intel Core processors by just about every measure. However, those improvements come in varying levels of magnitude, with battery life gains being the smallest.  It\u2019s difficult for us to say that you\u2019re going to be massively rewarded for spending that extra scratch to get the latest-and-greatest, 8th-gen version of a given laptop you\u2019ve been eying. Frankly, because you\u2019re not: in real-world use, and for most users, you\u2019re not going to see a world of difference.

The electronics are crammed into the stems and control a very low-powered, class-one laser that shines a red, monochrome, low-fi image into your eye. Perhaps crucially, the glasses contain no camera, eliminating the big brother vibe from Glass and other smart glasses. Vaunt is mainly aimed at giving you relatively simple heads-up notifications. Intel says the glasses are more stealthy than a smartwatch, allowing you to check notifications while doing other activities. But would you want a pair?  He's as overconfident as ever.

A US Paralympian designed Team USA's snowboard prosthetics    Mike Schultz was a professional snowmobile racer, but in 2008, his life's course took a turn after a competition accident shattered his left knee and left him clinging to life. When his injuries began causing his kidneys to shut down, doctors decided to amputate the leg just above the knee.    \"I spent a total of 13 days in the hospital and was able to get back home on Christmas Eve to a whole new world of challenges,\" he explained. \"Later that spring, after learning how to walk on my everyday prosthetic leg, I realized pretty quickly that I needed a plan B to get back into sports and the fun activities that I wanted to do.\" That plan B turned out to be designing his own prosthetic leg -- one purpose-built to handle the rigors of extreme sports -- and starting a fabrication company, Biodapt, to produce it. Thus, the Moto Knee was created.    Jay Y.

Samsung vice chairman Jay Y. Lee was meant to spend five years behind bars after being found guilty of bribing public officials. Now, after spending close to a year in detention, he has been released and will spend the next four years on probation.  Lee was arrested as part of the corruption scandal that brought down South Korean President Park Geun-Hye, herself awaiting trial.    The nation is trying to battle a big uptick in road deaths.  France bans smartphone use in cars even when you pull over    Road deaths have been on the rise lately in France and with nothing much else to pin it on, authorities are going after scofflaw drivers who text or call. It's now illegal to hold your phone on public roads even when you're pulled over to the side, whether you're blocking traffic or not. The high-court ruling means that taking what some consider to be a safe step -- pulling over to talk on the phone -- could still result in points and a fine of 135 euros.    The company just has to make more than one.  Sondors' three-wheeled EV is affordable and stylish    Starting a new car company is tough. In fact, it's nearly impossible. Then Tesla pulled it off. As we transition from the internal combustion engine to electrification, startups and even a few established players are taking a chance on EVs. Building a three-wheeled autocycle isn't revolutionary, exactly. But making an EV starting at $10,000, with all the usual amenities, makes it a car worth watching. Plus, it looks spectacular.

Qualcomm and Apple have been in a bitter licensing dispute and Apple lately has switched to Intel chips in a portion of its devices. Should Broadcom succeed in buying Qualcomm, it could smooth over relations with Apple, closing a door to further possible gains from Intel.  A Broadcom deal would be Intel\u2019s biggest acquisition by far\u2014and should it pursue one, there is no guarantee regulators would bless it. Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., and with a market value of nearly $240 billion, has been acquisitive in recent years as it looks to diversify away from its core business of powering the personal-computer industry, which is in decline.  Last year, Intel bought Israeli car-camera pioneer Mobileye NV for roughly $15.3 billion in a bet on connected cars. In 2015, it struck its largest deal ever when it bought Altera Corp. for $16.7 billion. Intel hoped that buying Altera, a maker of programmable chips, would help bolster its position in server systems and other equipment found in data centers and telecommunications networks, the company said at the time, as well as fuel its plans surrounding the so-called Internet of Things.  In the most recent piece of drama surrounding Broadcom\u2019s bid to buy Qualcomm, the effort was dealt a setback when the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or CFIUS, indicated it has concerns about the takeover and would review it.  That appeared to lengthen the odds that Broadcom and its chief executive, Hock Tan, would succeed in their pursuit of Qualcomm, which has rejected the $117 billion offer as too low.  Separately, Qualcomm has in place its own pending $44 billion deal to buy NXP Semiconductors NV, which it sweetened in February, a move Broadcom criticized.  Qualcomm and Broadcom unleashed dueling announcements Friday as each sought to win support from regulators and shareholders during the takeover fight.  Qualcomm, looking to assert its board\u2019s independence, said Paul Jacobs would no longer be executive chairman. Mr. Jacobs, the son of Qualcomm co-founder Irwin Jacobs, will remain on the board. Current board member Jeffrey Henderson was named nonexecutive chairman.  Broadcom has been seeking to replace a majority of Qualcomm\u2019s board members to help pave the way for a deal. A vote on the directors that was slated to take place this past Tuesday at Qualcomm\u2019s annual meeting was pushed back a month at CFIUS\u2019s behest.  Broadcom, meanwhile, pledged that if it succeeds in acquiring its target, it wouldn\u2019t sell \u201cany critical national security assets to any foreign companies.\u201d The assurance was a nod to U.S. concerns that a takeover could weaken Qualcomm\u2019s position\u2014and therefore the country\u2019s standing\u2014as a leader in developing next-generation 5G cellular technology.  Broadcom late Friday said it will ask shareholders to vote March 23 to approve the company\u2019s plan to redomicile from Singapore to the U.S., potentially setting the stage for a showdown with CFIUS as the vote would take place in the middle of the panel\u2019s review of Broadcom\u2019s bid.  If Broadcom were considered a U.S. company, its acquisition would arguably fall outside of the panel\u2019s jurisdiction, though CFIUS could say it still has jurisdiction to review the bid since it began the review while Broadcom was a Singapore company.  Should Broadcom fail in its bid for Qualcomm, it is possible Intel would stand down, happy with the status quo.  Underlying the maneuvering is a battle among chip companies to be the chief supplier of critical cellular components to smartphone makers such as Apple and Samsung Electronics Co.  Qualcomm is a leader in chips that run apps and manage cellular communications in smartphones. It competes with Broadcom in chips for short-range wireless networking, including Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, and radio filters and other chips that condition cellular signals.  Intel, which dominates the market for the calculating engines in personal computers and data-center servers, missed the mobile revolution when its chips proved too power-hungry for battery-dependent cellphones. But Intel\u2019s cellular communications chips lately have displaced Qualcomm\u2019s in a portion of Apple\u2019s iPhones, and the company has been moving aggressively to develop that product line.  Acquiring Broadcom would give Intel a suite of smartphone chips, adding to its own communications chips the Singapore-based company\u2019s radio filters as well as Bluetooth and GPS components.  Broadcom sells a diverse line of equipment for networking and communications\u2014including technology for smartphones from Apple and Samsung\u2014as well as data storage, electronic displays and set-top boxes. Broadcom, like Qualcomm, is a so-called fabless chip company, designing processors while relying on manufacturers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to actually make them.  Under Mr. Tan, Broadcom has pursued a string of acquisitions. The company was formed when Avago Technologies Ltd. in 2015 agreed to buy the former Broadcom for roughly $37 billion and kept its name. Broadcom\u2019s revenue was twice the size of Avago\u2019s at the time of the merger.

INTC -1.63% is considering buying Broadcom Ltd. AVGO 3.14% , a company valued at more than $100 billion, shows the depth to which the chip giant feels threatened by a potential tie-up between Broadcom and its rival Qualcomm Inc. QCOM 0.96%  Since late last year, Intel has been exploring a bid for Broadcom to forestall that company\u2019s $117 billion offer for Qualcomm in what would be the biggest-ever tech deal, people familiar with the matter told The Wall Street Journal in an article published Friday. Intel\u2019s interest in derailing that deal reflects its worry that a combined Broadcom-Qualcomm, which would create the third-largest chip company by revenue after Intel and Samsung Electronics Co., would endanger its competitive position, the people said.  A merged Broadcom and Qualcomm would combine market-leading smartphone chips with a strong presence in data centers, two areas Intel has targeted for growth. And Qualcomm\u2019s own proposed purchase of Dutch automotive chip specialist NXP Semiconductors NV would turbocharge such a merger in the automotive market, where Intel has placed one of its biggest bets.  \u201cYou\u2019d have this powerhouse going up against you,\u201d said analyst Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein Research, noting the combined revenue of Broadcom and Qualcomm\u2014nearly $40 billion in fiscal 2017\u2014would be formidable even relative to Intel\u2019s $63 billion in the same year. Nonetheless, he finds an Intel-Broadcom merger unlikely.  There are several reasons why such a combination may not happen. Intel is weighing a range of alternative acquisitions, the Journal reported Friday, and a hostile Broadcom offer would present enormous challenges of financing, complexity and regulatory scrutiny.  Intel has made relatively few big deals in its 49-year history\u2014the largest was in 2015 when it acquired Altera Corp. for $16.7 billion\u2014and it has previously had a spotty track record of folding them in.  Intel in a statement said its focus is on integrating its recent purchases and \u201cmaking them successful for our customers and shareholders.\u201d The company declined to comment further.  An Intel-Broadcom tie-up may not even make sense in terms of strengthening Intel, according to some analysts. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any benefit to Intel,\u201d said Handel Jones, a consultant at International Business Strategies. In particular, he said, Broadcom\u2019s products wouldn\u2019t mesh well with Intel\u2019s manufacturing operations, where the chip giant could use additional volume to reduce costs.  But the prospect that Intel could bid for Broadcom reflects tectonic forces reshaping the semiconductor industry as chips make their way into all manner of consumer and industrial products, from smart speakers to urban infrastructure.  Intel, with a market capitalization of about $243 billion, holds over a 90% share in its core markets of processor chips in personal computers and data-center servers, according to Mercury Research, leaving it scant room to grow in those areas as PC shipments continue their persistent decline.  Intel has responded, in part, by moving aggressively into cellular communications chips, where it has replaced Qualcomm units in a portion of Apple Inc.\u2019s iPhones and made inroads with the next-generation 5G cellular specification.  It has advanced into the automotive industry with its $15.3 billion purchase of Mobileye NV, a leader in sensors for assisted-driving features like automated lane keeping and collision avoidance.  And it has doubled down on its data-center business, supplying companies like Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. that are spending tens of billions annually on hyperscale cloud-computing facilities.  Hitching Broadcom, whose management style has driven a sevenfold increase in its share price over five years, to Qualcomm, whose products form the bedrock of the mobile market, could threaten Intel\u2019s progress in all three areas.  Broadcom declined to comment. Qualcomm didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.  Qualcomm has focused on developing key cellular technology, playing a leadership role in 5G. That research keeps its chips ahead of the competition, and it has resulted in a patent portfolio that yields a royalty on nearly every smartphone sold, whether or not they contain Qualcomm chips\u2014a revenue stream that typically provides most of Qualcomm\u2019s pretax profit.  Since early 2017, though, Qualcomm has been in a bitter legal war with Apple over its royalty rates, which the iPhone maker alleges are unfair. Qualcomm hasn\u2019t been able to resolve the conflict quickly, and Apple is considering replacing Qualcomm chips entirely with products from rivals including Intel.  Broadcom also sells chips to Apple, and its chief executive, Hock Tan, claims to have a strong relationship with the iPhone maker. If Broadcom takes over Qualcomm, he believes he could resolve the Apple dispute. In that case, Apple could boost Qualcomm\u2019s presence in iPhones at Intel\u2019s expense, especially as 5G ramps up in coming years.  A combined Broadcom-Qualcomm also could wreak havoc on Intel\u2019s ambitions in self-driving cars. Qualcomm\u2019s acquisition of NXP awaits antitrust approval in China, its final regulatory hurdle, which Qualcomm has said it expects soon. Completing the purchase would pave the way for Qualcomm\u2019s 5G chips and self-driving tech. The extra heft that Broadcom would give that combination could create a counterweight to Intel and Mobileye.  Broadcom also sells switches to makers of data-center equipment, while Qualcomm is pushing into data centers with server processors that compete directly with Intel\u2019s. The prospect of selling Qualcomm\u2019s server chips through Broadcom\u2019s data-center channels may give Intel pause.  And Mr. Tan likely wouldn\u2019t stop there. He built Broadcom on a string of ever bolder acquisitions. Having rolled up Qualcomm\u2014if his takeover effort gets that far\u2014he could continue to enlarge his portfolio of market-leading franchises, potentially blocking Intel\u2019s efforts at every turn.  \u2014Dana Mattioli  and Dana Cimilluca contributed to this article.

SES SA will join Intelsat SA\u2019s campaign to keep serving customers in a chunk of the C-band. Photo: handout/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images  Two top commercial satellite operators agreed to team up on a plan to clear some of their wireless spectrum for use by other companies, a move they say will spur new telecom investment.  SES SA said it will join Intelsat SA\u2019s I 2.02% campaign to keep serving U.S. customers in a chunk of the C-band, a swath of airwaves in the middle of the broader radio spectrum, while allowing other wireless operators to take over a smaller sliver of the band. The companies said they serve about 90% of the U.S. market in the C-band, which media companies use to beam video to cable companies for distribution.  The success of the satellite companies\u2019 proposal, also backed by computer chip maker Intel Corp. INTC -1.63% , will affect how quickly the U.S. adopts fifth-generation, or 5G networks. Several telecom companies are jostling for increasingly scarce spectrum licenses that could support connected cars, medical equipment and other gear that would be constantly connected to the wireless network.  The plan could still face opposition from wireless carriers that would prefer to move all satellite operators off the band entirely. Satellite companies have said that is a non-starter.  \u201cIt would not really be feasible to say, \u2019Hey move to another band, we\u2019re using this now,\u2019\u201d Intelsat Chief Executive Steve Spengler said in an interview. \u201cSatellite operators have built satellites specifically for this. There\u2019s a huge investment that\u2019s already in place today.\u201d  The focus now shifts to the Federal Communications Commission. The agency has yet to launch a rule-making process for the spectrum but is expected to start in the coming months. Satellite companies say they could start moving their operations to a narrow section of the band about two years after that process starts.  \u201cI\u2019m not persuaded that there is a better path than the one we\u2019ve created,\u201d SES CEO Karim Sabbagh.  If the plan succeeds or the FCC auctions off all of the spectrum, there will likely be plenty of takers.  A much-maligned pitch for a new government-backed 5G network focused heavily on the C-band. The proposal\u2019s authors argued it was the broadest and most useful radio frequency available to U.S. policy makers looking to jump-start 5G infrastructure investment.  Government officials quickly disavowed that plan, which included an idea for a nationalized government-run network, but the band is still the subject of intense private-sector interest.  \u201cIt really is the sweet spot for wireless operators to think about,\u201d said Tim Farrar, a telecom analyst at industry research TMF Associates. He noted that wireless operators like Sprint Corp. have locked up many other licenses that could serve the same purposes. \u201cIt\u2019s not the beachfront property, but it\u2019s a hotel with vacant rooms.\u201d  Write to Drew FitzGerald at andrew.fitzgerald@wsj.com", "stock": "INTC"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-justice-stonewall-continues-1523219016", "label": 1, "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "date": "2018-04-08", "article": "Hours after we published an editorial Friday about the Justice Department\u2019s refusal to turn over a document subpoenaed by the House Intelligence Committee, Chairman Devin Nunes (R., Calif.) received an official response from Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd.  It was cleverly spun. Mr. Boyd played up the access to the secondary information Mr. Nunes had demanded\u2014access to the application and renewals for the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants on one-time Trump associate Carter Page. Mr. Boyd describes his department\u2019s response as \u201cextraordinary accommodation.\u201d  Upon inspection, however, the focus on the FISA warrants looks more like an effort to distract attention from Mr. Boyd\u2019s refusal even to mention Mr. Nunes\u2019s main request of FBI Director Christopher Wray and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. That request was for the \u201celectronic communication,\u201d or memo, that officially launched the counterintelligence investigation into alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.  On Friday Trey Gowdy, an Intel Committee member who has seen a redacted form of the memo, said Justice has redacted the \u201cgood stuff.\u201d He means information that would tell whether the counterintelligence investigation was credible, and how and whether the FBI vetted the information. \u201cAll of that,\u201d Mr. Gowdy said, \u201cis in a paragraph I can\u2019t read.\u201d  Justice says the blacked-out paragraph can\u2019t be shared with Congress because it identifies a foreign country that shares intelligence with the U.S. This is a hard argument to credit, given that in December someone told the New York Times that Australian diplomat Alexander Downer was the source for the information that minor Trump campaign official George Papadopoulos had bragged about Russian dirt on Hillary Clinton. In February former CIA Director John Brennan referred to the FBI\u2019s relationship with British intelligence when asked about the information on Mr. Papadopoulos.  Mr. Nunes needs this information because it is crucial to understanding whether Justice and the FBI had good reason to launch this investigation\u2014and how they handled it. The Papadopoulos narrative matters to the FBI, because attributing the launch of the investigation to him minimizes the role of the now infamous Steele dossier.  Some suspect that the real reason Justice is keeping this paragraph secret is because it might reveal embarrassing facts about how the Papadopoulos information was used. This might include a role for political actors (rather than intelligence officials) in ginning up the Trump-Russia investigation.  Meanwhile, on Saturday President Trump asked in a tweet what \u201cJustice and the FBI have to hide\u201d? He added, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t they giving the strongly requested documents (unredacted) to the HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE?\u201d\u2014which has subpoenaed similar information about FBI actions during the 2016 election.  The President might ask the same about the stonewalling of the Intel Committee. Do Mr. Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions think that ignoring the committee\u2019s main request is in the spirit of the \u201cextraordinary accommodation\u201d that Mr. Boyd claims?  The Justice Department is part of the executive branch. If either Mr. Sessions or Mr. Trump believes Mr. Boyd is not being responsive to Congress, one of them should put someone there who will be.", "stock": "INTC"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/democrats-for-eavesdrop-abuse-1519598461", "label": 1, "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "date": "2018-02-25", "article": "The House Intelligence Committee on Saturday released the long-awaited Democratic response to allegations the FBI abused its surveillance powers during the 2016 election. Committee Chairman Devin Nunes owes ranking Democrat Adam Schiff a thank you for assisting his case.  The 10-page Democratic memo begins by declaring that \u201cThe FBI and DOJ officials did not \u2018abuse\u2019 the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) process, omit material information, or subvert this vital tool to spy on the Trump campaign.\u201d Yet the facts it lays out show the opposite.  In particular the memo confirms that the FBI used an opposition-research document paid for by the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee as part of its application to surveil Carter Page, who was associated with the Donald Trump campaign.  Democrats dispute the degree to which the FBI relied on the dossier created by opposition-researcher Christopher Steele in applying for its FISA court order, but that\u2019s beside the point. If the FBI had as much \u201ccompelling evidence\u201d and \u201cprobable cause\u201d as the memo asserts, it would not have needed to cite the Steele document. And the Democrats do not dispute that the Steele dossier was the FBI\u2019s only source in its initial FISA application for its allegation that Mr. Page met with suspect Russians in Moscow in July 2016.  The Democratic memo makes no attempt to rebut the widely reported news that former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe told Congress that the FBI would not have sought a surveillance warrant without the dossier. Democratic Rep. Jim Himes claimed on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that Mr. McCabe never said that, but then why not put that in the memo?  The Democratic memo also confirms that the FBI withheld from the court the partisan provenance of the dossier. Democrats even provide, for the first time in public, the precise language the FBI used in its initial application in a long, obfuscating footnote.  Democrats say the FBI told the FISA court that a \u201claw firm\u201d [Clinton/DNC firm Perkins Coie] hired \u201can identified U.S. person\u201d [oppo-research firm Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson ] to \u201cconduct research regarding Candidate #1s ties to Russia.\u201d The \u201cidentified U.S. person\u201d then hired \u201cSource #1\u201d [Mr. Steele] to do the research. The footnote ends: \u201cThe FBI speculates that the identified U.S. person was likely looking for information that could be used to discredit Candidate #1\u2019s campaign.\u201d  Speculates? Likely? Could? The dossier was paid for by actors whose overriding purpose was to defeat Mr. Trump. Nowhere do Democrats say the FBI used the words \u201cpolitical\u201d or \u201cpartisan\u201d or \u201ccampaign,\u201d much less Clinton or Democratic National Committee.  The Democratic memo claims the FBI acted \u201cappropriately\u201d in not \u201crevealing\u201d the name of an \u201centity\u201d in a FISA application, but this is laughable. The FBI sometimes masks identities to preserve sources and methods, but the Steele dossier was a pastiche of gossip and rumor based on Mr. Steele\u2019s contacts. Disclosing his partisan funders would have betrayed no important intelligence sources but would have given the court reason to ask the FBI for more credible information before granting an eavesdrop order.  Messrs. Steele and Simpson briefed their media friends in September and October about their dossier, despite FBI prohibitions. The FBI nonetheless falsely told the court that Mr. Steele wasn\u2019t the source of a Yahoo News article that it used as additional evidence in its application. While the Democratic memo repeatedly refers to Mr. Steele\u2019s reporting as \u201creliable\u201d and \u201ccredible,\u201d it confirms that the FBI fired Mr. Steele after it found he hadn\u2019t told the truth about his media spinning.  The Democratic memo devotes considerable space to smearing the hapless Mr. Page, as if he\u2019s some kind of master spy and the Rosetta Stone of the Trump-Russia story. Yet no one has offered proof that he colluded with the Russians, and he hasn\u2019t been indicted.  Democrats also make much of the fact the FBI started looking into the Trump campaign in July 2016 but didn\u2019t receive \u201cSteele\u2019s reporting\u201d until \u201cmid-September.\u201d So what? The issue here is the fairness and honesty of the FISA application in late October (not the investigation), and what matters is that the FBI didn\u2019t move on the FISA application until after it received the dossier.  ***  The only definitive evidence of political \u201ccollusion\u201d so far is that the Clinton campaign paid Mr. Steele to troll his Russian sources for dirt on Donald Trump. The FBI then used this dirt as a reason to spy on Mr. Page and anyone he was communicating with.

One reason the maestros of tech are becoming political targets is because they are seen as partisan and disdainful of middle America.  \u201cSilicon Valley is a one-party state,\u201d Mr. Thiel said last month during a debate at Stanford University. \u201cThat\u2019s when you get in trouble politically in our society, when you\u2019re all in one side.\u201d He\u2019s right.  Once such Valley icons as Intel and Hewlett-Packard were seen as nonpolitical. But the titans of recent vintage\u2014Google, Facebook and others\u2014are rightly seen as thoroughly allied with the political and cultural left. Google\u2019s purging of conservative James Damore was something of a watershed of public recognition of this reality, and a declaration by a Facebook board member like Mr. Thiel is further affirmation of this bias.

I will leave to others the implications for democracy when a U.S. president singles out a company that he wants to punish, but from a business point of view, his crusade is nuts. For all of Trump's huffing and puffing, there is little he can do to inflict pain on Amazon and its chief executive, Jeff Bezos. It's amazing that he can't see it.  The president complains that Amazon doesn't pay taxes. For the most part, that hasn't been true; between 2007 and 2015, it paid a combined tax rate (for federal, state, local and foreign) of 13 percent, on par with many big companies. Last year, however, it did not pay any federal taxes. Why? It appears that Amazon was able to take advantage of some provisions in Trump's pride and joy, the tax cut he signed in December. In addition, while Amazon for years fought efforts to force it to collect state and local sales tax, it has begun doing so, even collecting from its third-party vendors. Besides, there is simply no way Trump can target one company for a different tax treatment than other companies. So much for taxes.  According to the news site Axios, Trump has mused about using antitrust law to whack Amazon. In fact, there are many people who believe that big tech companies like Amazon, Facebook and Google deserve far more antitrust scrutiny than they've gotten, and indeed, that antitrust policy needs to better reflect their enormous power. I'm one of them.  But singling out Amazon is no way to go about it. It causes antitrust experts to shrink from the subject because they don't want to be seen as doing Trump's dirty work. And it puts the Justice Department's antitrust division in a terrible spot. Having already sued to stop AT&T from buying Time Warner after Trump complained about the deal, the division's leaders would look like lackeys if they went after Amazon, too. Indeed, given the current state of antitrust law, which is very forgiving of big companies making big acquisitions, there is nothing for the government to go after Amazon for.  It's possible, I suppose, that Trump could prevent Amazon from getting government contracts. In 2013, the company successfully brought cloud computing to the Central Intelligence Agency, and it is the current front-runner for a 10-year, multi-billion-dollar cloud computing contract with the Pentagon. Other tech companies are lobbying to get a piece of the contract, and perhaps the Defense Department will conclude that it's not worth inviting the president's ire to give it to the company with the most experience and biggest market share. Fear not. Amazon had over $177 billion in revenue last year and is on track to easily top $200 billion in 2018. If it never sees another penny from the government, it will do just fine.  Finally, there is the relationship that Trump has complained about most frequently: Amazon's business with the U.S. Postal Service:  I am right about Amazon costing the United States Post Office massive amounts of money for being their Delivery Boy. Amazon should pay these costs (plus) and not have them bourne by the American Taxpayer. Many billions of dollars. P.O. leaders don\u00e2t have a clue (or do they?)! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 3, 2018  Back in 2012, the Postal Service was in deep trouble. A self-financed agency since the 1980s, it had lost $25 billion over the previous six years, and $6.5 billion in just the first six months of the year. It had three big problems. First, even though it was expected to generate its own revenue, Congress made it hard to do things that could save billions, like closing rural post offices or ending Saturday delivery. Second, Congress imposed a bizarre requirement that it pre-fund retiree health-care premiums to the tune of $5.5 billion a year. And third, fewer and fewer people were sending first-class mail.  The decline in first-class mail continues today. But postal revenue has largely stabilized at around $70 billion, and losses in 2017 were down to $2.7 billion. Why? Because despite the congressional impediments, the Postal Service has done some serious cost-cutting. Also, its package-delivery business is going gangbusters. This is almost entirely thanks to Amazon, which has started to rely on the Postal Service to get packages to customers' front doors.  QuickTake Q&A: Amazon and the Post Office  Although the terms of Amazon's postal contract have never been revealed, it is implausible that the deal costs the post office money, as Trump claims. What's more, if he thinks Amazon is getting too sweet a deal, he is actually in a position to do something about it. The Postal Service's overseer, its Board of Governors, is supposed to comprise 11 people. It currently has two: Megan Brennan, the Postmaster General, and her deputy, Ronald Stroman. Every other seat is empty.  Trump has nominated three people for the board, but even if all three were approved by the Senate, the board would still lack a quorum. And without a quorum, it can't do things like, well, renegotiate big contracts. It would be easy enough for Trump to find nominees who would vow to force Amazon to pay more. But to do that, he'd have to be paying attention to his job.  Trump's real motivation is doubtless to get back at Bezos for his ownership of the Washington Post, which regularly publishes unflattering revelations about his presidency and business life. But he really should have thought twice before going after Amazon and its CEO..  There may be some chief executives who would be rattled by attacks from the president. Bezos is not one of them. You'll notice that so far he hasn't responded to Trump's tweets, and he won't. He's too smart for that. And while Trump has managed to hurt Amazon's valuation, you would be hard-pressed to find a CEO who spends less time worrying about his company's share price than Bezos. Eventually, the market will realize that Trump's threats are toothless, and the stock will come back up again.  There is a final reason why Trump's attacks on Amazon are so misguided. If he could put aside his venom for Bezos, he might be able to see that Amazon is a company that's doing exactly what he says he wants American companies to do. It's creating jobs, not just tech jobs in Seattle but blue-collar jobs in the warehouses it has built around the country. It pays most of the tuition when workers want to learn skills that will lead to better jobs. It's in the process of choosing a second headquarters city where it will eventually employ up to 50,000 workers. It's getting into health care in an effort to bring down costs. It treats customers better than any other tech company. Oh, and its chief competitor isn't an American company but a Chinese one, Alibaba.  So go after Amazon if you insist, Mr. President. But if you keep it up, this is one crusade you may live to regret.

Amazon hadn\u2019t just invaded the home turf of the home-shopping channel QVC. As it has done with food delivery, travel and online payments, the Seattle giant had more or less recreated a rival\u2019s entire approach. In this case, the weapon was an online show, \u201cStyle Code Live,\u201d staffed with bubbly millennials promoting beauty and fashion products you could buy on Amazon.  \u201cThey tried to copy everything about our show,\u201d QVC Chief Executive Officer Mike George said in an interview.  Usually, this is the moment that foreshadows doom for a rival. But QVC didn\u2019t bend to Jeff Bezos\u2019s iron will. In May 2017, a little more than a year after introducing \u201cStyle Code Live,\u201d Amazon canceled the show. The retreat proved that QVC\u2019s formula\u2014unscripted hosts demonstrating products to an audience of mostly women on live television\u2014isn\u2019t as easy as it looks. (Amazon declined to comment.)  QVC hasn\u2019t been immune to the ongoing struggles in retail and television. It had four straight quarters of sales declines before posting an increase last quarter. Sales in some categories, such as hair care and jewelry, have continued to struggle. Like many other pay-TV networks, QVC\u2019s main channel has lost subscribers as more consumers drop their cable subscriptions.  But QVC isn\u2019t just another channel trying to adapt to the rise of cord-cutting or a retail brand looking for a toehold online. About half of QVC sales already happen online, and two-thirds of those purchases come from mobile devices. In January, after completing a $2.1 billion purchase of its rival, the Home Shopping Network, QVC Group became the third largest e-commerce retailer in North America, according to Internet Retailer. That means the combined cable channels trail only Amazon.com Inc. and Walmart Inc. among companies selling products in multiple categories.  Wall Street has noticed, with shares of QVC Group, which includes QVC and smaller retail brands, soaring 51 percent in the past year. The company is owned by John Malone\u2019s Liberty Interactive Corp., which lists the business as a separate tracking stock to reflect its value.  The executives running a channel whose name stands for Quality, Value, Convenience believe their business can survive because it does something that Amazon can't: \u201cYou\u2019re not going to be inspired by Amazon,\u201d said George, a 56-year-old former McKinsey & Co. partner who buys Keurig machines on QVC as birthday gifts. \u201cShopping should be joyful. It should be inspirational. That\u2019s what we can do.\u201d  On set at the QVC campus in West Chester, Pennsylvania. Source: QVC  Standing next to a clothing rack on a recent morning, QVC host Pat James-Dementri urged viewers not to wait to buy a blouse and tank-top set. Order now, she said using a familiar lure, and you can get 30 percent off. She translated the price into the channel's signature math: \u201cThree easy pays of $16.66.\u201d  In a dark room perched above the studio, producer Kevin McGovern wore a headset and monitored two screens. One tracked call volume; the other showed the colors and sizes left. The wine-colored blouse was the hot item this morning, and that real-time dashboard helped create a sense of urgency with shoppers at home. McGovern whispered into the host\u2019s earpiece, and the information went out to QVC\u2019s 100 million homes in James-Dementri\u2019s bright voice: \u201cThe wine is flying out of here!\u201d she told viewers.  While the format looks easy, a complex ballet takes place behind the scenes to make things go smoothly. There are no teleprompters or scripts. QVC hosts improvise, fielding calls and social media questions from viewers in real time. The channel features 770 products each week on the air in the U.S., and the average shopper spends more than $1,200 a year on the network\u2019s products.  \u201cQVC is a retail format that appeals to a woman who loves to shop. It would appear this woman is born every year.\u201d  QVC broadcasts every day, except on Christmas, from a 58,000-square-foot campus in West Chester, Pennsylvania, about 30 miles outside of Philadelphia. The main studio has more than 20 sets that resemble scenes torn from a Pottery Barn catalog, with plush couches and spotless kitchens. There's a 130-seat theater used for live segments with such celebrities as chef Rachel Ray or Catherine Zeta-Jones, who recently launched a home collection. A warehouse nicknamed Noah\u2019s Ark holds 300,000 items\u2014at least two of everything that QVC features on TV each day. There are parallel broadcast operations in seven countries, including China.  In one room, a headless mannequin wore a bra as part of an upcoming segment on Breezies underwear, which was to be a featured item known as \u201cToday\u2019s Special Value.\u201d On a brightly lit set nearby, Dennis Basso, a charismatic white-haired fashion designer, held up one of his dresses as the cameras rolled. \u201cI'm telling you,\u201d Basso said, \u201cthis is sooooo special.\u201d  Seated in a conference room at QVC\u2019s headquarters, George talks about the marriage with Home Shopping Network as something that will do more than save costs or unite celebrity pitchwomen: Serena Williams and Nicki Minaj sell clothing and perfume on HSN, while Martha Stewart and Ellen DeGeneres pitch home d\u00e9cor, beauty products and other items on QVC. The combined channels, George argues, will have the resources to innovate.  HSN was the pioneer in shopping by remote control instead of requiring viewers to pick up the phone or visit a website. Following the merger, George said, QVC is in talks with Comcast Corp. to enable the cable giant\u2019s 22 million subscribers to order items on the channel from their remote controls.  But that strategy will pay off only if QVC viewers keep their cable TV subcriptions. \u201cWe expect QVC to have more difficulty acquiring new customers,\u201d Citi analyst Jason Bazinet wrote in a September note that downgraded its parent company\u2019s stock to sell.  And the shoppers that are sticking around aren\u2019t young. George describes the typical viewer as an upscale woman in her 50s. A recent summary of the stereotypical QVC fan in Philadelphia magazine evoked \u201csilver-haired grannies ordering slow cookers and vibrating belly bands from landline phones.\u201d The public perception of a certain fustiness to the home-shopping demographic makes it challenging to attract millennials.  \u201cIf you go to other online retailers, it\u2019s a transaction. When you come to QVC, it\u2019s a social experience.\u201d  QVC executives insist they\u2019re mostly protected from the pressures facing both TV networks and brick-and-mortar retailers. Cord-cutters are cost-conscious young men, they say, while QVC viewers are women of a certain age with enough disposable income to afford cable-TV subscriptions and discretionary purchases. QVC executives refer to their viewers, who are about 80 percent female, simply as \u201cshe\u201d and \u201cher.\u201d  Those celebrity deals also give the channel a measure of protection by ensuring those products aren\u2019t available on Amazon. Martha Stewart\u2019s chambray blouse and electric snowblower are exclusive to the channel, and her on-air appearances are also streamed live on her Facebook page, introducing many of Stewart\u2019s fans to the shopping channel.  To reach the younger generation, QVC introduced a TV channel, Beauty IQ, that is simulcast on Facebook Live and features beauty experts who have big followings on Instagram and YouTube. In 2015, two years before the deal for the Home Shopping Network, QVC also paid $2.4 billion for Zulily, a flash sales site aimed at millennial moms.    QVC\u2019s digital strategy has started to pay off. The channel added about 417,000 new customers last quarter, the second-biggest increase for that period in 15 years. Amazon is perpetually lurking, of course. It has started to broaden Twitch Interactive, a video-game streaming site it acquired in 2014, to allow artists, chefs and musicians to sell products to their viewers. And about three-quarters of QVC shoppers are also users of the almost inescapable e-commerce site.  But analysts increasingly see QVC\u2019s future as \u201cthe anti-Amazon,\u201d in the words of Barton Crockett at B. Riley FBR Inc. Amazon is about inexhaustible selection, he said, while a 24-hour shopping show is a matter of constant salesmanship.  \u201cQVC is a retail format that appeals to a woman who loves to shop,\u201d Crockett said. \u201cIt would appear this woman is born every year.\u201d  QVC Control room Source: QVC  Some viewers tune in to just see hosts like David Venable. A 53-year-old former TV news anchor in Altoona, Pennsylvania, Venable got his start at QVC in 1993 selling patio furniture during the overnight shift. Today, he hosts two live cooking shows each week, deploying a folksy manner that evokes his southern upbringing. His nonstop patter is filled with anecdotes about how his grandmother and mother taught him to cook.  \u201cIn the Kitchen With David\u201d is one of QVC\u2019s most popular shows, drawing on average more than 2 million viewers. Wearing his apron, Venable answers questions on social media, makes new recipes and demonstrates cookware. He has sold almost 900,000 air fryers. Whenever Venable tastes a dish he really enjoys, he raises his hands and turns in a circle while saying \u201chappy dance, happy dance\u201d over and over. It\u2019s his signature move.  \u201cWe\u2019re establishing a relationship with viewers,\u201d Venable said in an interview. \u201cIf you go to other online retailers, it\u2019s a transaction. When you come to QVC, it\u2019s a social experience.\u201d  One of his most devoted fans is Cam Brockman, a 23-year-old retail sales associate in Charlotte, North Carolina.

But what measures can he actually take against the online retail giant?  He could push for probes of consumer protection, privacy and antitrust issues. He could also step up his support for allowing states to collect sales tax on third-party purchases from Amazon, or seek to have the Postal Service charge more to deliver packages. And he could thwart Amazon\u2019s aspirations to win a multibillion dollar Pentagon contract for cloud services.  Even with those powers, Trump\u2019s ability to act has limits. Inquiries by the Justice Department or the Federal Trade Commission could take years and bear a high burden of proof. The FTC and other enforcement agencies guard their independence, as does the board of governors of the Postal Service. Changes to the tax law would require cooperation from Congress, which just passed a tax overhaul and may have limited appetite to reopen negotiations.  The feud pits the world\u2019s most powerful man against one of the world\u2019s biggest corporations -- a global titan with $684 billion in market capitalization and more than half a million employees. At stake is its reputation, revenue and, potentially, ability to continue to disrupt markets as it reshapes retailing.  Any move made by Trump that is perceived as revenge against Amazon founder Jeff Bezos for his ownership of The Washington Post would invite comparisons to President Richard Nixon, who, at the height of the Watergate scandal, threatened the Post\u2019s broadcast licenses.  Amazon didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. While Amazon rose Thursday along with most U.S. stocks, the Trump attacks helped add to the shares\u2019 headwinds on Tuesday  and Wednesday. An 8 percent drop marked Amazon\u2019s biggest two-day decline in two years.  White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters told reporters aboard Air Force One Thursday that there are no specific plans to move against the company. \u201cThe president has expressed his concerns with Amazon,\" she said.  Seek antitrust inquiry of Amazon\u2019s dominance  If the administration opens an antitrust inquiry, enforcers would have to show the company has a monopoly in a market and that it abused its dominant position. But enforcers are intently focused on harm to consumers, and Amazon\u2019s retailing platform is beloved by its customers for its breadth and convenience.  Still, the company is not without criticism. Lina Khan, director of legal policy at Open Markets Institute, a Washington think tank that advocates for tougher antitrust enforcement, says Amazon should be scrutinized. One area of concern is the way Amazon can exploit information it collects about third-party sellers to better compete against them. Amazon can use sales data it gets from these merchants to undercut them on price or start selling its own versions of their products, Khan said.  Jeff Bezos Photographer: Peter Foley/Bloomberg  \"It\u2019s possible to believe two things: one, it\u2019d be deeply troubling and improper for Trump\u2019s personal animus toward Jeff Bezos to be the basis of an antitrust action, and two, Amazon\u2019s structure and conduct raise anticompetitive concerns worthy of an antitrust investigation,\" she said.  Trump\u2019s Justice Department already has shown unorthodox thinking on antitrust enforcement. Last year it sued AT&T Inc. to stop its acquisition of Time Warner Inc. -- which owns CNN, another frequent Trump target. The move surprised many antitrust lawyers because the two companies don\u2019t compete directly.  Competing retailers have long expressed concern about Amazon\u2019s potential to push them out of business but enforcers are skeptical when complaints come from rivals because they want to see vigorous competition in markets.  Make Amazon pay sales taxes like traditional retailers  Trump\u2019s complaints about Amazon not paying sales tax echo those of states and local jurisdictions that have complained about a loss of tax revenue as sales shift from brick-and-mortar stores to Amazon.  Trump supports bipartisan bills in Congress that would allow states to mandate collection of sales taxes because U.S. policy should ensure that \"those who are competing with Amazon are on a level playing field,\" White House spokesman Raj Shah said Thursday.  In 2017, Amazon, which also supports the bills, began collecting sales tax in states that levy them, but the company doesn\u2019t charge shoppers sales tax when they buy from third-party vendors that sell on the site. Those sales make up about half the company\u2019s volume.  States and local governments lose approximately $5 billion a year in taxes from Amazon marketplace commerce because merchants don\u2019t collect them and shoppers don\u2019t pay them after the fact, according to James Thomson, a former Amazon employee who is now a consultant for e-commerce merchants. The company doesn\u2019t break out how much revenue comes from third-party sales.  The Trump administration has also urged the U.S. Supreme Court to let state and local governments collect billions of dollars in sales taxes from online retailers. The justices are scheduled to hear arguments next month centering on a South Dakota law that calls for collecting sales taxes from large internet retailers even if they don\u2019t have brick-and-mortar stores in the state. A ruling is expected by late June.  Charge Amazon higher postage  Trump has said the Postal Service should be charging Amazon more for delivery.  \u201cWhy is the United States Post Office, which is losing many billions of dollars a year, while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages, making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer?\u201d Trump told his 45 million followers in January.  A sudden increase in postal service rates would cost Amazon about $2.6 billion a year, according to an April report by Citigroup. That report predicted United Parcel Service Inc. and FedEx Corp. would also raise rates in response to a postal service hike.  The Postal Regulatory Commission, which sets rates, has one vacant seat among its five commissioners, who are named by the president.  But the Postal Service would also be a loser. Despite Trump\u2019s assertions, Amazon is a valuable customer. And the Postal Service\u2019s losses have little to do with Amazon and more to do with its large health-care obligations and the dwindling use of first-class mail. USPS charges some of the world\u2019s lowest stamp prices.  Brad Parscale, who is managing Trump\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign, hinted that the administration may act to raise Amazon\u2019s postal costs in a tweet late Thursday. \u201cOnce the markets figure out that a single @usps rule change will crush @amazon \u2019s bottom line we will see,\u201d Parscale wrote.  Weigh in against Amazon in the Cloud Wars  Amazon, which has sought government contracts beyond the Postal Service, could also face opposition to its bid to become the sole supplier of the Defense Department\u2019s multibillion dollar cloud services award, which is slated to be made in September and for which Amazon is seen as the front-runner.  The company\u2019s 2013 cloud deal with the CIA for $600 million has put it in pole position to win the award, which could last up to 10 years and put the company ahead in the race for future contracts as the Pentagon pushes to modernize its technology.  The Pentagon\u2019s announcement earlier in March that it would choose one vendor for the contract has prompted criticism from Microsoft Corp., International Business Machines Corp. and industry groups representing rivals such as Oracle Corp.  And lawmakers charged with funding the Pentagon have asked the department to justify the single-source award in language accompanying the recent spending bill.  Trump could issue an executive action that says the government can only contract with smaller firms for instance, although the president\u2019s comments could bolster Amazon\u2019s case if it decided to bring a court challenge, said John Hudak, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution.  \"The president\u2019s own rhetoric about Amazon probably hinders his ability to use executive action,\" Hudak said.  \u2014 With assistance by Lynnley Browning, and Toluse Olorunnipa", "stock": "AMZN"}, {"url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2018-03-26/amazon-s-health-care-threat-is-already-reshaping-the-industry", "label": -1, "source": "bloomberg", "date": "2018-03-26", "article": "Without having done much yet, Amazon.com Inc. is already transforming U.S. health care -- and not necessarily for the better.  The mere threat of the online giant getting into the health business prompted the country's two largest pharmacy benefit managers -- CVS Health Corp. and Express Scripts Holding Co. -- to join forces with two of its largest insurers, Aetna Inc. and Cigna Corp. These deals will put more U.S. health care under the control of fewer companies. The merging companies say this will lower costs for consumers and the country. But the reality will likely be less rosy and more complicated.  Looming Amazon is worth $200 billion more than the country's five largest insurers and three largest pharmacy benefit managers -- which will shortly be consolidated into five total companies Source: Bloomberg  That these companies can even make such deals is due partly to the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, which blocked the mergers of Anthem Inc. with Cigna and Aetna with Humana Inc. Those mega-insurers would have been too busy digesting to make big vertical deals and too large to be acquired by other insurers.  UnitedHealth Group Inc. has been another major motivator for these mergers. It successfully pioneered a strategy of aggressive diversification by buying a large PBM in 2015 and with its Optum health-services unit. The gravitational pull of its success -- it leads peers in patient enrollment, revenue growth, and market valuation -- has inspired copycats. Profit pressure on PBMs, meanwhile, likely helped make them receptive to merging with insurers.  Pole Position UnitedHealth has consistently outgrown its rivals in recent years Source: Bloomberg  But Amazon's long shadow also helped instigate these deals. With its technological prowess, long investment horizon, bottomless appetite for new business and tolerance for thin margins, any mention of its interest in health care rattles investors, particularly in the industry's middlemen.  If the deals go through, the result will be an unprecedented level of market concentration.  All three of the biggest U.S. PBMs will be tied to three of the country's biggest insurers. CVS, Express Scripts, and UnitedHealth process more than 70 percent of all U.S. prescriptions. Post-merger, three companies will insure more than 90 million people in some capacity, process more than 3.5 billion prescription claims, and generate more than $500 billion in revenue.  Not every American will have both their medical and drug benefits managed by the same company. But many more will in the years to come. These integrated companies have more information about their customers and more ability and incentive to manage the totality of their health spending.  UnitedHealth is already all-encompassing, with its continuing investment in everything from ambulatory surgery centers to physician groups. CVS and Aetna -- which will add retail pharmacies and primary care clinics to the equation -- could have an unprecedented role in patient lives.  The deal spree may continue. Anthem and Humana look lonely. While Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. focuses on retail pharmacies in the U.S., its main rival's increasing breadth puts it at an uncomfortable disadvantage.  Even if this is the end of the deal-making, the impact of what has already happened will be far-ranging. Drugmakers and providers won't enjoy negotiating with these new giants. As for consumers, drug and provider options may narrow. Aetna and CVS will want to drive people to its own clinics, as UnitedHealth already does with its own provider network.  And PBMs are more effective and profitable when more people use tightly controlled drug plans; enrollees at newly affiliated insurers may find their drug choices are more restricted. The more people PBMs can push toward or away from a given medicine, the more negotiating leverage they have with drug manufacturers.  The merging companies have claimed huge cost savings will flow to consumers from these deals, but I'm skeptical. Research suggests costs can actually end up rising in some cases of health-care consolidation. Less competition means more pricing power for the companies that remain. Markets with more insurers have lower premiums, while prices rise when hospitals buy physician groups. Though these are vertical deals, they will add to the market power of major players in already heavily consolidated industries, which seems like a recipe for monopolistic behavior.  True, reducing the number of middlemen who get a taste of nearly every transaction should theoretically cut costs. And these giants will be able to compel larger discounts from drugmakers and providers. But it would be a rather large deviation from standard capitalist practice if these conglomerates don't capture most of those savings for shareholders.  The newly merged companies will have debt to pay off and must prove to investors the deals were smart. That likely won't leave much in the way of cost savings for the average customer  Amazon and its partners say they hope to create a new and better health-care system, free of the profit motive, for their employees. But the unintended consequences of their interest in the sector will impact a far larger group of Americans much sooner.

Amazon Trumps the President Corporate chiefs mentioned Amazon thousands of times in the last year, more than a certain U.S. president Source: Bloomberg  Google CEO Sundar Pichai told analysts in October that the company was devoting more attention to retailers because of their interest in cloud computing, online advertising, digital payments and other services Google (and Amazon) offer. Pichai didn't mention retailers' fear of Amazon, but he did use the term \"flywheel effect,\" which -- ahem -- is a favorite phrase of Bezos.  Diane Greene, the leader of Google's cloud business, was more direct about the company's motivations this week. At a conference, she said Google was considered a helping hand by retailers, software makers and companies in other industries that aren't eager to use Amazon's cloud service. \"Now everybody is looking at Amazon,\" Greene said. \"We're their friend.\"  That's what you'd expect Google to say, of course. But there's anecdotal evidence that some companies really are avoiding Amazon Web Services, its cloud business. Supermarket chain Kroger Co. uses Microsoft and Google cloud products, but not Amazon's. \"It doesn't make sense for us to do a ton to help grow that business for them,\" a Kroger executive told CNBC last fall. Stock analysts at Piper Jaffray have also heard financial-services and logistics companies expressing concern about using Amazon products, and going to Microsoft instead.  Run down the list of private sectors that spend the most on information technology -- health care, banking, retail, insurance -- and all of them worry Amazon is coming for them. To be sure, it's hard to quantify the Amazon fear effect on Amazon itself. Growth in the company's e-commerce sales and cloud revenue shows few signs of slowing. AWS actually reaccelerated in the fourth quarter.  Amazon Warrior Amazon's revenue reached nearly $180 billion in 2017, and it is growing at more than 25% a year Source: Bloomberg  Amazon paranoia is not new. Some companies have long avoided selling their products on Amazon or using the company's payments tools. My colleague Sarah McBride also wrote more than a year ago about retailers encouraging one another to ditch AWS over concern their money would strengthen Amazon's e-commerce operation.  What's changed is that Amazon has entered a more Death Star-ish phase. After the stunning acquisition of grocery chain Whole Foods last summer, it seemed any company or industry might be in Amazon's sights. Worries about the company's potential incursions may have motivated a $68 billion health care merger. This is not normal.  The widespread corporate fear of Amazon even got the attention of the Onion, which last year published a satirical opinion piece written by \"Jeff Bezos\" with the headline: \"My advice to anyone starting a business is to remember that someday I will crush you.\" Good advice.

And their parents. And most of their grandparents.  But one group of potential customers has eluded the world\u2019s biggest Internet retailer.  Teenagers, otherwise known as Generation Z, with their lack of debit and credit cards, their absence of bank accounts and their overwhelming preference for actually putting on clothes and going to physical stores to buy things they could purchase online, pose a big challenge to Amazon.  Amazon\u2019s answer: The internet behemoth is in early discussions with banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Capital One Financial Corp. to create a product similar to checking accounts, according to people familiar with the matter who requested anonymity. Amazon aims to tailor the accounts to appeal especially to youngsters and those who own no plastic in their wallets, the people said.  Debit Devotees Consumers between the ages of 18-24 prefer debit cards to other forms of payments Source: Total System Services Inc.  \u201cThe sooner you can start collecting information on them, the better prepared you are,\u201d said Tim Barefield, a managing director at the consulting firm Kotter International. \u201cFor Amazon, it\u2019s another way to expand their brand. Their brand is reaching out every place that their tentacles can reach out to.\u201d  The move shows Amazon\u2019s recognition that digital accounts for minors potentially lock in lifetime customers before they even leave their parents\u2019 house. Amazon is savvy about its users\u2019 life cycles. It offers new parents discounts on diapers and baby food. It gives college students discounted Amazon Prime memberships, providing free shipping and access to streaming video so young adults will already be Amazon shoppers when they start making more of their own spending decisions.  Pseudo Card  Since many young people don\u2019t qualify for credit cards, Amazon created a pseudo-debit card called Amazon Cash that lets teenagers drop off money at drugstores such as 7-Eleven Inc. and CVS Health Corp. and add it to an Amazon wallet they can use online.  But Amazon has long known the process is clunky and has wanted to take steps to make it easier for customers without bank accounts to shop on its website. Walmart Inc. and American Express Co. offer accounts called Bluebird that have made inroads with teens.  Amazon, led by billionaire Jeff Bezos, is trying to stay on top even as it had revenue of $178 billion last year, a 31 percent jump from 2016 and an almost 2,500 percent increase from 2004, when many of these potential new customers were born.  Service Charges  Children under the age of 18 typically aren\u2019t able to sign up for a bank account without parental consent. Checking accounts for high school students often come with monthly service charges and overdraft fees.  So there\u2019s a chance for Amazon to improve the banking experience, said Stuart Sopp, chief executive officer of Current, a startup that offers debit cards to teens.  \u201cI\u2019m sure Amazon is scaring the hell out of every single regional bank and credit union right now,\u201d Sopp said. \u201cThe banks have very clearly not serviced these demographics, so there\u2019s opportunity.\u201d  Check Yes Consumers said they were open to banking with Amazon, even if it came with a fee Source: Cornerstone Advisors, StrategyCorps  If Amazon could deliver a better banking experience for digitally savvy youngsters who are used to getting what they want with a few swipes or clicks, they might have banking customers for a long time, said Eric Marks, a senior director at the financial consultancy West Monroe Partners.  Amazon might also entice teens with its personal assistant Alexa. Such devices are popular among teens looking for a convenient way to pay, said Gavin Rosenberg, a senior director at the payments processor Total System Services Inc.  \u201cThe younger generations are less concerned about privacy, so they\u2019re more apt to use them,\u201d Rosenberg said.  Adults, Too  The marketing opportunity doesn\u2019t end with teenagers. The e-commerce giant could also end up persuading people to close their existing bank accounts and open a new one with Amazon, according to a Cornerstone Advisors study published in January. It would also be a chance for a bank to partner with the online gargantuan.  \u201cRight now, banks might not be offering exactly what millennials want or need,\u201d said Marielle Schurig, a financial adviser at UBS Group AG who works with high-net-worth millennials. \u201cA lot of monthly statements don\u2019t offer insights or tools to manage your records or analyze your spending to budget or save for the future\u201d -- something Amazon might provide.

Though filled with less import than the company\u2019s $13.4 billion acquisition of Whole Foods Market last year, the deal was the second-largest in Amazon\u2019s history. And like all acquisitions, it gives us a rare glimpse into the way Jeff Bezos sees the future.  In the short term, Ring gives Amazon another piece in its Alexa puzzle and a leg up in its race against Google and Apple to control homes that will increasingly be filled with connected appliances. Alexa is a nice novelty now, great for serving up the weather, reading the news and hosting the occasional trivia game. But it will be really useful when it\u2019s the hub that lets people use their voice to arm their security systems, open locked doors and flash video of the person who\u2019s ringing the doorbell out front. Google understands this as well; the new $229 Nest doorbell will come with a free Google Home Mini when it starts shipping this spring.  Alexa currently works with a host of third-party smart home products. But owning Ring\u2019s varied assortment of video doorbells, security cameras and accessories allows Amazon to accelerate their development and make them exclusive to Alexa. (It bought a similar company, Blink, last year.) Amazon can also do the typical Amazon thing and lower prices, probably by incorporating the optional subscription plans for keeping recorded video into the soup of benefits that is a Prime membership.  There\u2019s also a medium-term benefit to adding Ring. Package theft, a.k.a. \u201cporch pirates,\u201d is a rampant problem in much of the country, one that has required Amazon delivery people to start emailing customers photographs of packages left by the front door, and which, in the past, has forced the company to restrict same-day delivery from neighborhoods with high crime rates. Last year, Amazon introduced a home camera and a service called Amazon Key, which automatically opens doors for verified delivery people. Amazon Key works with so-called \u201csmart locks\u201d made by other companies. Ring doesn\u2019t sell door locks just yet, but you can imagine a day when Amazon owns all the components to make such a service work.  The implications of the Amazon-Ring deal are really interesting to contemplate when we start thinking farther out. We know Amazon wants to deliver groceries. But leaving bags of kale and cartons of milk outside for hours doesn\u2019t work, and many Amazon Fresh subscribers aren\u2019t crazy about accumulating those bulky blue totes filled with dry ice. When Amazon is behind your home security system, your doorbells and door locks, Amazon workers will be able to walk in, unpack the bags and bring the milk right to the refrigerator.  But why stop with groceries? With its endless appetites, Amazon wants to expand in the massive home-services category, fertile ground for companies like Handy Technologies Inc. and Thumbtack Inc. Imagine sitting at school or in your office and being able to buzz in the cable guy or a plumber after verifying they are who they say they are with live video on your phone.

Amazon.com Inc. is a convenient scapegoat for just about any issue. The mail is no different.  Amazon isn\u2019t killing the post office. Since signing a landmark contract in 2013 to expand their business relationship and deliver packages on Sunday, revenue has ticked up; losses are down; and shipping is just about the only growth segment in the mailbag. The Postal Service is saddled by larger issues. Sure, there\u2019s the internet, and nobody is sending postcards anymore, but the big financial dilemma is the agency\u2019s yearly obligation to set aside cash to cover health care costs for future retirees. This accounts for billions in losses.  Give Up? U.S. Postal Service makes small improvements but is nowhere close to sustainable Source: U.S. Postal Service  U.S. mail is also required to cover every American, employing carriers who roam neighborhoods six days a week (or seven, if Amazon has a package ready). The Postal Service has said it actually makes money on the Amazon deal. E-commerce revenue provides \u201cessential support to pay for the network and infrastructure that enables us to fulfill our universal service obligation,\u201d David Partenheimer, a spokesman for the Postal Service, wrote in a January op-ed. \u201cAll users of the mail benefit.\u201d  The Amazonification of U.S. Mail Shipping revenue overtook junk mail for the first time last year Source: U.S. Postal Service  Amazon rebuilt its delivery network around the post several years ago. The company operates \u201c sortation centers\u201d that complement warehouses and organize packages by zip code before sending them to post offices for the final leg of delivery. In Kenosha, Wisconsin, Amazon has a million-square-foot warehouse, connected to a 500,000-square-foot sort center with a covered conveyor belt that resembles an airport skybridge.  Ending the U.S. mail relationship would probably be a bigger setback for Amazon than for the Postal Service. On a dark day in late 2011 when the postmaster general proposed cutting 100,000 staff and shutting thousands of post offices, EBay Inc. shares dropped more than 6 percent. Amazon\u2019s deal came soon after, and radical cuts were avoided\u2014probably not a coincidence.  So the e-commerce giant got the Postal Service off life support, but any benefit beyond that is minimal. Nothing short of a complete overhaul of the mail system, some kind of bankruptcy-style financial restructuring or reneging on those health-care promises would turn the Postal Service into a sustainable business.  Maybe that\u2019s Trump\u2019s goal. Building an antitrust case against Amazon\u2014an idea the President has floated\u2014is a tall order. Amazon\u2019s five-year contract with the Postal Service could be up for renewal this year.

But no one expected him to pull in Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon, too.  News Tuesday that Bezos\u2019s Amazon.com Inc., Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co., led by Dimon, plan to join forces to change how health care is provided to their combined 1 million U.S. employees sent shock waves through the health-care industry.  The plan, while in early stages and focused solely on the three giants\u2019 staff for now, seems almost certain to set its sights on disrupting the broader industry. It\u2019s the first big move by Amazon in the sector after months of speculation that the internet behemoth might make an entry. The Amazon-Berkshire-JPMorgan collaboration will likely pressure profits for middlemen in the health-care supply chain.  Details were scant in a short joint statement on Tuesday. The three companies said they plan to set up a new independent company \u201cthat is free from profit-making incentives and constraints.\u201d  It was enough to sink health-care stocks. Express Scripts Holding Co. and CVS Health Corp., which manage pharmacy benefits, slumped 6.9 percent and 4.9 percent, respectively. Health insurers such as Cigna Corp. and Anthem Inc. and biotechnology companies also dropped.  The group announced the news in the very early stages because it plans to hire a CEO and start partnering with other organizations, according to a person familiar with the matter. The effort would be focused internally first, and the companies would bring their data and bargaining power to bear on lowering health-care costs, the person said. Potential ways to bring down costs include providing more transparency over the prices for doctor visits and lab tests, as well as by enabling direct purchasing of some medical items, the person said.  \u201cI\u2019m in favor of anything that helps move the markets a bit, incentivizes competition and puts pressure on the big insurance carriers,\u201d said Ashraf Shehata, a partner in KPMG LLP\u2019s health care and life sciences advisory practice in the U.S. \u201cAn employer coalition can do a lot of things. You can encourage reimbursement models and provide incentives for the use of technology.\u201d  \u201cHard as it might be, reducing health care\u2019s burden on the economy while improving outcomes for employees and their families would be worth the effort,\u201d Bezos said in the statement. \u201cSuccess is going to require talented experts, a beginner\u2019s mind, and a long-term orientation.\u201d  The initial focus of the new company will be on technology solutions that will provide U.S. employees and their families with simplified, high-quality and transparent health care at a reasonable costs. In the statement, JPMorgan CEO Dimon said the initiative could ultimately expand beyond the three companies.  \u201cOur goal is to create solutions that benefit our U.S. employees, their families and, potentially, all Americans,\u201d he said.  HTA Alliance  Amazon, Berkshire and JPMorgan are among the largest private employers in the U.S. And they\u2019re among the most valuable, with a combined market capitalization of $1.6 trillion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  This isn\u2019t the first time big companies have teamed up in an effort to tackle health-care costs. International Business Machines Corp., Berkshire\u2019s BNSF Railway and American Express Co. were among the founding members of the Health Transformation Alliance, which now includes about 40 big companies that want to transform health care. The group ultimately partnered with existing industry players including CVS and UnitedHealth Group Inc.\u2019s OptumRx.  Top Team  The latest effort is being spearheaded by Todd Combs, who helps oversee investments at Berkshire; Marvelle Sullivan Berchtold, a managing director of JPMorgan; and Beth Galetti, a senior vice president for human resources at Amazon.  Todd Combs Photographer: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg  Buffett handpicked Combs in 2010 as one of his two key stockpickers. Combs, 47, has been taking on a larger role at Berkshire in recent years, and Buffett has said that Combs and Ted Weschler, who also helps oversee investments, will eventually manage the company\u2019s whole portfolio. Combs also joined JPMorgan\u2019s board in 2016.  Sullivan Berchtold joined JPMorgan in August after eight years at the Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis AG, where she was most recently the global head of mergers and acquisitions, according to her LinkedIn profile.  One of the highest ranking women at Amazon, Galetti has worked in human resources at the e-commerce giant since mid-2013, becoming senior vice president almost two years ago, according to her LinkedIn profile. As of late 2017 she was the only woman on Amazon\u2019s elite S-team, a group of just over a dozen senior executives who meet regularly with Bezos, according to published reports. Previously Galetti worked in planning, engineering and operations at FedEx Express, the cargo airline of FedEx Corp. She has a degree in electrical engineering from Lehigh University and an MBA from Colorado Technical University.  The management team, location of the headquarters and other operational details will be announced later, the companies said.  Health-care spending was estimated to account for about 18 percent of the U.S. economy last year, far more than in other developed nations. Buffett has long bemoaned the cost of U.S. health care. Last year, he came out in favor of drastic changes in the U.S. health system, telling PBS NewsHour that government-run health care is probably the best approach and would bring down costs.  \u201cThe ballooning costs of health care act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy,\u201d Buffett said in Tuesday\u2019s statement. \u201cOur group does not come to this problem with answers.

If the Berkshire/JPMorgan venture is as ambitious as it seems, incumbents are in trouble.  The great and oft-heralded Amazon.com Inc. foray into health care is here, and it's not what we expected.  The company isn't diving headlong into drug distribution or becoming a pharmacy benefit manager (PBM). Along with JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Berkshire Hathaway Inc., it announced a more interesting idea Tuesday -- a new company aimed at lowering the cost of employee health coverage.  Though no one sector will face the full wrath of Bezos, this joint venture is a potential competitive threat to all of health care's many middlemen.  Bad News, Guys The vague but potentially dreadful news of an Amazon/Berkshire Hathaway/JPMorgan health care venture sank managed care and PBM stocks on Tuesday Source: Bloomberg  This isn't Corporate America's first stab at controlling ballooning health-care costs. Caterpillar Inc. runs its own PBM for employees. Forty plus U.S. companies are part of the Health Transformation Alliance, founded in 2016 to \"fix our broken health care system\" by pooling data and uniting to wrest better terms from PBMs, among other things.  But Amazon, Berkshire and JPMorgan seem to have bigger ambitions than just negotiating prices with service providers. You don't need to create a whole new company or devote significant resources to do that.  A key line in the detail-light release announcing the new company is that it will be \"free from profit-making incentives.\" That looks like a shot at PBMs and health insurers, who try to lower costs but also maximize profit for stakeholders, resulting in a perverse and very expensive system. But it could also be aimed at health-care providers, given their Byzantine pricing and the outsize share of costs they represent.  The release said the new company's \"initial focus\" will be on using technology to provide simpler, cheaper, and more transparent health care for employees of the three founding firms. Whatever that means, it seems likely the ultimate aim may be to independently design and run employee health coverage.  With nearly 1.2 million employees and hundreds of billions in combined revenue -- along with the combined expertise of three of the most successful companies in history -- Amazon, Berkshire and JPMorgan have the requisite firepower to do this.  A Bit of Muscle Amazon, Berkshire, and JPMorgan have scale and financial firepower to put behind their new health-care venture Source: Bloomberg/fililngs  Insurers and PBMs now must worry about other companies following this blueprint. Even scarier for them is the idea that the Amazon/Berkshire/JPMorgan company will eventually recruit other employers to join it. That's a real possibility, given the venture's ambition and the fact that it's creating a new company rather than a less-formal alliance. In the release, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon teased the idea of potentially helping \"all Americans.\"  Incumbents aren't necessarily doomed just yet. This venture is in its infancy, and health care is complicated. The U.S. system is opaque, fragmented, and heavily regulated. Technology is often proclaimed as a health-care cost panacea, and rarely delivers.  The most effective way to reduce health-care costs is to restrict choice. People hate when they are denied their preferred care or medicine by an insurer or PBM. Imagine the reaction (and broader brand consequences) if Amazon is doing the denying.  There's also the question of negotiating power. The triumvirate may have 1.2 million employees, but UnitedHealth Group Inc. -- to take one example -- provides or manages employee health insurance for nearly 30 million people.  But because the new company isn't initially trying to make a profit and will likely aim to avoid paying high fees to middlemen, it may not have to push provider or drug prices quite as low to get a good result. Think the difference between active and passive management, but for health care.  The pedigree of the companies involved and the current lack of detail may have me reading too much into this effort. But if it's as ambitious as it sounds, then health-care incumbents are in trouble.

The online retail giant plans to roll out two-hour delivery at Whole Foods this year to those who pay for Amazon's $99-a-year Prime membership. It is the company's biggest move since it bought the organic grocer last year.  It's also precisely the action rivals have been preparing for since the day Amazon \u2014 with the Prime program that's been so successful in cementing customer loyalty \u2014 announced plans to buy Whole Foods.  Amazon shoppers can order meat, seafood and other Whole Foods grocery items through the Prime Now app and website. Deliveries started Thursday in Austin, Texas; Cincinnati; Dallas; and Virginia Beach, Virginia; and will expand nationwide this year.  While convenient, not everyone wants other people picking out their eggs or fruit. A major hurdle for companies that offer grocery delivery is getting those people to sign up, said Darren Seifer, a food and beverage industry analyst at NPD Group.  \"There are always going to be people who want their bananas a little green,\" he said.  Ade Ogbomo, a teacher in Dallas, said she orders everything from Amazon \u2014 except food.  \"I like to get it myself,\" she said outside a Whole Foods store. She worries about the possible mishaps: \"Maybe the bananas are bruised or the cookies are all broken up, and you can't really complain because you asked for it.\"  Good, though, said she thinks Whole Foods has high-enough quality produce that she's not worried about choosing items herself.  About 7 percent of U.S. households bought groceries online last year, according to NPD Group. Most of those \u2014 about three-quarters \u2014 get their orders delivered to their door; the rest pick it up at the store. NPD Group said it expects online grocery shopping to grow quickly, especially among young adults, who are more comfortable shopping online.  And grocery chains don't want to miss out when that happens.  Walmart, the country's largest grocer, is making it easier for customers to order groceries online and pick them up at the store. Target bought grocery-delivery company Shipt late last year. Kroger, the largest traditional supermarket chain, has been promoting store pickup for online orders and doing trials of home delivery.  Maggie Anderson, 38, a therapist in Cincinnati, said she has tried it at Remke, a regional chain.  \"I just did my first order online at Remke this week because I was of out of town, and that was great,\" she said. \"It saved me a whole hour and a half of time.\"  For Amazon, items will be pulled from Whole Foods stores, bagged and then delivered by Amazon drivers. Amazon, based in Seattle, said there's no extra fee for two-hour deliveries above $35, but one-hour delivery will cost $8. The company isn't saying where delivery will expand, but its Prime Now service is in more than 30 cities, including Chicago, Milwaukee and San Diego.  The announcement gives Amazon yet another way to get groceries to customer's doorsteps.  It already does so through AmazonFresh, but that requires a $15-a-month fee. And Prime Now delivers groceries from its facilities, but it has also offered grocery delivery from other physical stores, including Whole Foods rival Sprouts Farmers Market.  Whole Foods also offers delivery in some cities through a partnership with delivery service Instacart, which will continue.  Buying Whole Foods was the biggest part of a push into physical retail for the chain known for online shopping. Right after taking over Whole Foods, Amazon made a splash by cutting prices on bananas, yogurt and other items. It also began selling Kindle e-readers in some of its 470 stores, and started selling Whole Foods-branded food on its site.  Good's friend Debbie Alf, who picked up some fruit and lunchmeat on Thursday, said she's intrigued by the two-hour delivery pledge. Would she give it a try?  \"Maybe sooner than you think,\" she said. \"If I forgot something, maybe later today.\"  ____  Pisani reported from New York and Sewell reported from Cincinnati.

Amazon is set to enter the Vietnamese market by providing e-commerce services for the Vietnam E-commerce Association (VECOM), which is a group of 140 local online businesses, according to the Nikkei Asian Review.  Amazon will help these companies sell and export their products through its platform, and details of its plans are expected to come at the Vietnam Online Business Forum 2018 on March 14.  Partnering with third-party merchants is likely a precursor to Amazon entering the market with its full slate of offerings. Before launching its full marketplace and warehouse in Australia, Amazon helped Australian third-party sellers make offshore sales, and prior to recent reports that Amazon is looking to launch in Brazil, it ran a marketplace for third-party sales of electronics and appliances. The Seattle-based company may be looking to use its partnership with VECOM as a way of getting its footing in Vietnam and building familiarity with consumers before introducing its full marketplace, Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA), Prime, and more.  This launch in Vietnam suggests that Southeast Asia is a focus for Amazon's international expansion plans. Amazon also launched in Singapore, its first market in Southeast Asia, in July 2017, where it is now operating in full with Prime and Prime Now. These first two forays occurring so close to each other may mean that Amazon has grand plans for the region, which would make sense as Southeast Asia's e-commerce sales are projected to climb to $88 billion by 2025, up from an estimated $11 billion in 2017. The region is particularly valuable to Amazon because the growth of its Prime subscriber base is reportedly slowing, and international markets, especially ones with the potential of Southeast Asia, could provide a significant boost.  Amazon will face stiff competition in Vietnam, and Southeast Asia as a whole, from Alibaba and JD.com. In Vietnam specifically, Lazada, which Alibaba owns 83% of, controls approximately 30% of the country's e-commerce business, according to the Nikkei Asian Review.com. JD.com has shown interest as well, investing approximately $50 million in Tiki, a Vietnam-based online retailer that it intends to help with fulfillment, logistics, and more. The presence of both of these powerful companies will make it difficult for Amazon to succeed in Vietnam, and if the company looks to expand to other markets, like Indonesia, it will find similar situations, often with Alibaba and JD.com having a significant head start.", "stock": "AMZN"}, {"url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-is-killing-these-7-companies-2017-7", "label": -1, "source": "business-insider", "date": "2018-01-30", "article": "Amazon is famous for its aggressive growth.

Software firm Daon has developed software that will allow customers to use Amazon Alexa-enabled devices, like Echo smart speakers, to send and receive peer-to-peer (P2P) transfers with their banks, according to CNET.  The tool would have customers ask Alexa to open Daon, tell the skill to check a balance or send funds, and give a name, at which point the user would be pushed to authenticate biometrically using their phone. Recipients would have to be added as a designated payee option using online or mobile banking in order to prevent fraud. Daon doesn't yet have any partners to launch the service, but is reportedly in talks with various players that could bring the tool to fruition within the next 18 months.  The move comes as the P2P payments space continues to expand, and as banks look to take a further stake in the game. Business Insider Intelligence estimates that mobile P2P volume will hit $336 billion in 2021, up from $19 billion six years earlier. As volume grows, more players are moving into the space, including banks that are part of the Zelle network, and third-party players, like Apple and Google, which are developing their own services.  As banks specifically seek to compete, a voice partnership would be a smart move, since it could give them early entry to a growing market and fast access to a wide swath of potential users. This news comes following rumors about Amazon pushing to partner with a bank to develop a checking-account-like product, which could incorporate technology like Daon's to extend functionality to Alexa products, making it a win-win for both players.  But voice-based P2P could face obstacles that are tough to overcome.  Voice payments are becoming more popular, but they still appeal to just a small share of the population. Last year, 8% of US adults had used voice commands to buy something or send money \u2014 a figure poised to quadruple by 2022, representing massive gains but still keeping adoption at just 31% of the overall population.

Daon's product has tools to counteract that, like authentication and payee designation, but even with bank branding, which might help, it likely won't be enough to overcome all fears. On top of that, these measures detract from the consumer experience by pushing them back to their mobile device to complete the payment. For many users looking for convenience, it might be tough to justify a multi-device payment when they could simply use an existing service via smartphone alone, especially since many of these already have voice integrations through Siri on iPhones, for example.

Phones purchased through the program still come pre-loaded with Amazon apps.  Amazon announced on Tuesday that it will remove the ads from the discounted Android phones on its Amazon Prime Exclusive Phones program on Wednesday.  Currently, Android phones on the Amazon Prime Exclusive Phones program display Amazon deals and offers on their lock screens. In exchange, customers get a decent discount on Android phones from well-known manufacturers, provided you're a member of the $99/year Amazon Prime program.  Discounts are always great, but it's a tradeoff that some weren't willing to make.  Previously, getting a phone through the program meant you couldn't customize the background wallpaper of the lock screen. Amazon also said that removing the ads from the lock screen will allow for these phones to support features like facial recognition and fingerprint scanners.  LG  Certain phones, like the LG G6+, are only available on Amazon's Exclusive Phone program. Others, like the Moto G5 Plus and Moto E4 are available from Motorola's online store. Essentially, it means that Amazon Prime members can now buy certain Android phones for a lower cost than almost anywhere else, without the compromise of dealing with Amazon ads on their lock screens.  For example, the Moto G5 Plus costs $200 on Amazon's program, whereas it costs $230 from Motorola's site. And the $500 LG G6+, an Amazon exclusive, is a larger version of the LG G6, which costs $600 or more.  Still, the phones will continue to come pre-loaded with Amazon apps, so you're still buying into the retailer's ecosystem.  As of Tuesday, you have a pretty decent choice of phones from the Amazon Exclusive Phones program. With that said, newer phones models from companies like LG and Moto are expected to be released soon, so it may be wiser to wait for the newer models when they arrive on the Amazon Exclusive Phone program.

Amazon Channels allows users to subscribe to and view various OTT networks, but the service is currently focused on offering ad-free services like HBO and Showtime. Users can watch Amazon Channels on Prime Video devices, such as the Amazon Fire TV, which accounted for 24% of the streaming device market share in Q1 2017.  Amazon Channels has proven to significantly help OTT services onboard subscribers in the past \u2014 it accounted for 40% of subscribers for NBCUniversal's now defunct streaming service Seeso in May 2017, for example.  Opening Amazon Channels to ad-supported OTT services will give companies like Hulu, which offers a $7.99 package with limited commercials, a better shot at monetizing their content. Moreover, the move to open Amazon Channels to ad-supported services will come at a time when a growing number of TV networks are launching such services in response to the growth of cord cutting.

Mario Tama/Getty Images  Amazon's fourth-quarter results, which it announced Thursday, topped analyst expectations.  The company's cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services, grew rapidly and again provided the bulk of Amazon's profits.  Investors cheered the results, sending the company's stock up 6% in after-hours trading.  Amazon's stock jumped more than 6% after the e-commerce giant topped Wall Street's fourth-quarter expectations.  The company reported its holiday-period results on Thursday afternoon. At the time of writing, Amazon's stock was up $85.00 a share, or 6.1%, to $1,475.00.  Here's what the company reported, compared with what analysts polled by Bloomberg had forecast:  Revenue: $60.5 billion; analysts were expecting $59.85 billion.  $60.5 billion; analysts were expecting $59.85 billion. Amazon Web Services sales: $5.1 billion; the one analyst who offered an estimate to Bloomberg was looking for $5 billion.  $5.1 billion; the one analyst who offered an estimate to Bloomberg was looking for $5 billion. Earnings per share: $3.75; analysts were expecting $1.83 a share. The company's bottom line was boosted by a windfall of $789 million \u2014 or $1.59 a share \u2014 related to the new tax law. Without that benefit, the company would have earned $2.15 a share, beating estimates regardless.  Amazon also shared its guidance for the first quarter of 2018:  Revenue (Q1 projected): Between $47.75 billion and $50.75 billion; Wall Street had projected $48.7 billion. Amazon posted $35.7 billion in revenue in the first quarter of 2017.  Between $47.75 billion and $50.75 billion; Wall Street had projected $48.7 billion. Amazon posted $35.7 billion in revenue in the first quarter of 2017. Operating income (Q1 projected): Between $300 million and $1 billion. Amazon posted $1 billion in operating income in the first quarter last year.  The company's results showed once again the strength of AWS \u2014 and its importance to Amazon's bottom line. Revenue from the company's cloud business grew 45% in the fourth quarter from the same period a year earlier.  Meanwhile, AWS's operating income grew by 46%, to $1.4 billion. That means AWS accounted for 73% of the net income Amazon posted for the period.  Amazon gave only scant details about Whole Foods, the grocery chain it bought last year. The internet company's physical stores, which are largely its Whole Foods outlets, collectively brought in $4.5 billion in sales in the holiday quarter.  By comparison, Whole Foods as a standalone company brought in $4.9 billion in sales in its fiscal first quarter of 2017, approximately the same period a year earlier. But the sales results were actually ahead of Amazon's forecasts, Brian Olsavsky, Amazon's chief financial officer, said on a conference call with investors.  For the quarter, Whole Foods posted a small operational loss, thanks to some non-cash charges, Olsavsky said. Whole Foods earned $95 million in its comparable quarter a year earlier.  Amazon is focusing on cutting prices at the grocery chain, even beyond those it rolled out immediately after taking control of Whole Foods last August, Olsavsky said. But its integration of Whole Foods is continuing apace, he suggested.  The company has already placed some of its automated lockers \u2014 which customers can use to pick up products or return products they've ordered online \u2014 in Whole Foods stores. It plans to list Whole Foods products on the Amazon website and to introduce a customer rewards program, Olsavsky said.  \"Well have more later in the year,\" he said. He continued: \"There's much more to come.\"  Some analysts and investors were skeptical about Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods and have been wondering how far along the company is in integrating Whole Foods into the rest of its operations.  Amazon was one of the three Big Tech companies that reported earnings on Thursday, along with Apple and Alphabet. Alphabet shares slid after hours after missing Wall Street earnings targets.

Getty/Stephen Brashear  Amazon Go is Amazon's futuristic store that uses cameras and sensors to charge customers for what they take from shelves.  Loup Ventures' Andrew Murphy thinks that Amazon will license the tech for other stores.  In this way, Amazon would have a \"Trojan horse\" into traditional brick-and-mortar retail.  Amazon may be going in another direction with its \"just-walk-out\" technology.  According to a new bit of analysis from Loup Ventures' Andrew Murphy, Amazon could leverage the technology in Amazon Go \u2014 the company's futuristic store that uses sensors, not cashiers, to correctly charge customers for what they take \u2014 in a different way than anticipated.  Instead of simply opening more Amazon Go stores, he thinks the company will instead license the technology to other retailers, which would give Amazon a \"Trojan horse into the brick and mortar retail space.\"  In this way, it would be similar to the infrastructure Amazon built with its cloud-computing platform, AWS, and its third-party marketplace offering, Fulfillment by Amazon.  Amazon is clearly interested in moving into the brick-and-mortar space, and the technology in Amazon Go could be \"a turnkey solution for automated retail,\" Murphy said.  This probably doesn't mean you're going to see the tech in general merchandise competitors like Walmart or Target, but specialty retailers, like Nike, that already sell their goods on Amazon could look to add it to their growing retail presence. It could save on labor costs, or ensure workers focus on customer service instead of rote jobs like cashing out customers.  The race to automate cashiers' jobs as Amazon Go does has the company in the \"pole position\" to cash in on what Murphy says is a $50 billion opportunity for retailers.  The technology could be a strong driver to bring more brands into the fold as the company courts more and higher-end brands to work with.  Amazon partnered with Calvin Klein over the holidays, using its Echo smart speakers in fitting rooms to answer customers' questions or change the lighting. More collaborations could be possible as Amazon's tech offering convinces more brands to work with it.  A recent report from Recode said Amazon is opening additional Amazon Go stores in Seattle and Los Angeles, with more stores potentially in the works.", "stock": "AMZN"}, {"url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-how-president-trump-could-go-after-amazon-2018-3", "label": -1, "source": "business-insider", "date": "2018-03-29", "article": "BI Intelligence  This story was delivered to BI Intelligence \"E-Commerce Briefing\" subscribers hours before appearing on Business Insider.

He reportedly feels that Amazon is not paying its fair share of taxes, and has previously claimed that The Washington Post is being used to cover up Amazon's supposed evasion, as Jeff Bezos runs Amazon and owns the newspaper. President Trump is also unhappy with how he believes Amazon is hurting the retail industry, and brick-and-mortar retailers in particular.  President Trump does not currently have a specific plan to attack Amazon, and one may never comes to pass, but there are several ways he could go about it.  Antitrust regulation: Amazon captures a huge percentage of US e-commerce sales and e-commerce growth, without showing signs of slowing down, which has led many to consider the case that it is a monopoly that should be broken up. Such a case would not be close to a slam dunk, as it's unclear if Amazon is a threat to competition or considered to be one under antitrust laws. But if it was successful, the resulting regulations would alter Amazon significantly.

President Trump could lead the charge on finding ways to increase Amazon's federal tax bill in order to take a bigger piece of its revenue and hinder the company. Sales taxes:Amazon collects sales tax in jurisdictions where it is required to, but online sales tax laws vary from state-to-state and city-to-city, and this complexity leads to Amazon not having to collect taxes in certain places. Additionally, in many states, Amazon does not collect taxes for sales from its third-party vendors, leaving it up to them. However, many of these merchants are unclear of their responsibilities, and therefore hesitate to charge sales tax. Although some states are looking into the missing taxes, others have yet to make an effort to solve the problem; until every affected state starts cracking down, Amazon's marketplace will continue to have a price advantage over competitors. If President Trump were to make a push for tougher online sales taxes nationwide, it could give him his desired result of a weakened Amazon.  Meanwhile, the company is still selecting the location for its second headquarters, and has fielded bids that could further shield it from taxes. Amazon has received a number of bids that feature tax breaks, the ability to keep its employees' income taxes, and likely much more, all of which would make it easier for Amazon to pay less in taxes. While these deals would be valuable to Amazon, the potentially extreme level of tax immunity they provide may lead to public backlash, which could bring on new regulations and laws that would hurt the company.", "stock": "AMZN"}, {"url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-web-services-2017-revenue-2018-2", "label": -1, "source": "business-insider", "date": "2018-02-01", "article": "Amazon Web Services CEO Andy Jassy Amazon  Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing division of Amazon, saw major gains in fourth quarter 2017 earnings Thursday as the tech giant tighens its lead in the cloud wars.

Walmart is now price matching Amazon on 53% of all online products, according to data from e-commerce analytics firm Profitero, reported on by Retail Dive.  Moreover, Target is matching 37% of its products to Amazon's prices, while Jet.com is matching 35%. But, even with competitors' price-matching attempts, Amazon remains a cost leader, as its prices are 10% lower than all retailers' on average.  Walmart has been pushing to undercut Amazon, and its recent efforts have been a success.  Walmart closed the gap on pricing differences with Amazon by the end of 2017, averaging only .3% higher than Amazon from December 2016 to November 2017, down from 3% higher for the same period in the previous year. The retailer has also been using tactics, such as pickup discounts, to help customers save money on online orders.  Walmart's in-store prices are lower than the e-commerce titan's by 10.4% on average. Noteably, Walmart dominated in home goods and kitchen appliances, undercutting Amazon by 33% and 21%, respectively.  But competing on price may hurt the retailer's efforts to increase margins on online orders. Walmart requested that vendors offer more products priced at $10 or above in an effort to avoid taking a loss on shipping small orders. However, this move may counteract the price-matching efforts it's been making, especially among consumers who aren't brand-loyal, as online shoppers may turn to retailers that have a large assortment of low-priced items to shop from.  Walmart could see more success by offering an array of items under $10, but requiring that they be an \"add-on\" to a larger order. This would allow shoppers to get the low-priced items they're looking for, while increasing margins on shipping online orders for Walmart.  These price wars are likely to have a ripple effect across the entire retail industry, as Amazon ramps up efforts across all segments. Amazon is already stealing apparel sales from retailers, with its pricing and discounts being a major attraction to consumers. Apparel retailers are feeling the effect of this, as they struggle to move inventory and are forced to significantly markdown items. Meanwhile, the grocery segment has been fiercely competing to have the cheapest goods after Amazon entered the space via its acquisition of Whole Foods. But, as Amazon pushes its own brands, it is unlikely that any segment will be immune to the price war.", "stock": "AMZN"}, {"url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-is-taking-apparel-sales-from-retailers-2018-2", "label": 1, "source": "business-insider", "date": "2018-02-22", "article": "BI Intelligence  This story was delivered to BI Intelligence \"E-Commerce Briefing\" subscribers hours before appearing on Business Insider.

Many apparel shoppers are shifting their spending away from retailers like Target and Macy's, and toward Amazon, according to a study from Coresight Research emailed to Business Insider Intelligence.  The study found that Amazon already has a significant presence in apparel, with 46% of respondents saying they made an apparel purchase from the e-tailer in the past year. And that percentage is set to grow, as 48% expect to make an apparel purchase from Amazon in the next year.  Amazon is stealing apparel sales from big-box retailers and department stores alike.  More than 30% of Target shoppers have switched some of their apparel spending to Amazon. This high overlap makes sense because Amazon and Target are top destinations for apparel. However, Target apparel shoppers reported being more likely to shop on Amazon for apparel, and to have a Prime membership, than Walmart's customers. This puts Target and Amazon in direct competition for consumers. But both parties appear to be ready to compete, as they've been beefing up their rosters of private-label apparel brands.

Consumers are spending less of their apparel budget at Macy's, and Amazon is the most popular recipient of those lost sales, according to another Coresight Research study.Of the 26% of consumers who said they spend less on apparel at Macy's than they did three years ago, over 42% said they've switched that spending to Amazon \u2014 which is more than any other retailer. This shows that Amazon is making a dent in department stores' performance, even though it may lack the stores and prestige of its competitors.  Pricing and discounts appear to be a major draw for Amazon in apparel. Forty-nine percent of apparel shoppers said they go to Amazon because it offers good value, displaying that pricing is key for Amazon in the industry. This may hinder Amazon's ability to succeed in luxury fashion, as its low-price image may not be so appealing then, but it appears to be aiding its apparel efforts overall.  Prime subscriptions may be the key for Amazon as it tries to steal customers away.Prime subscribers were much more likely to have shopped for apparel on Amazon, and to plan on doing so going forward, than nonsubscribers. This means that Amazon will have to work as hard as other retailers for non-Prime subscribers, making it even more important for Amazon to grow Prime's subscriber base. However, the number of Prime subscribers who are expecting to shop on Amazon for apparel dipped slightly from the number who made purchases last year, meaning that Amazon may need to evaluate what is causing it to lose apparel customers.

Amazon has been hiring house cleaners because it's testing a new housekeeping service, dubbed Amazon Home Assistants, in its home city of Seattle, Bloomberg reports.  Amazon Home Assistants' workers can help customers with tasks like cleaning, laundry, and more, and the service has been generally well reviewed by customers so far.  Hiring its own employees and creating its own unique service is a new approach for Amazon in the housekeeping space.  Amazon launched Amazon Home Services in 2015, which is a marketplace where independent contractors can offer their services under the Amazon Home Services name. The program now offers services like help with home improvement, technology installations, and house cleaning. Despite the service's expansion to all 50 states, and Amazon's claim in 2016 that the market for home services was worth somewhere between $400 billion and $800 billion, Amazon Home Services' growth has been slow, according to Bloomberg, possibly leading to the new program.  Amazon Home Assistants targets a smaller market than Home Services: US consumers were estimated to have spent $16 billion on housecleaning in 2017 by ServiceMaster Global Holdings Inc., as cited by Bloomberg. By directly employing its workers and having more control over the service, Amazon may find more success with this new offering.  Amazon Home Assistants could tie-in well with Amazon's efforts to improve package delivery security. Amazon recently launched its Amazon Key program, which uses smart technology to enable in-home deliveries even when customers aren't home.  The program aims to provide more secure deliveries, thus giving consumers more reasons to buy from Amazon. Home Assistants could help this secure-delivery initiative in two ways: Users without Amazon Key could authorize the assistants to accept packages, increasing their value and Amazon's delivery performance, or Amazon Key could make it possible for users to let the assistants into their homes without being present, incentivizing them to use Amazon Key.  The service may make consumers comfortable with Amazon having a pronounced presence in their homes, benefiting some of the company's other efforts. The e-commerce titan introduced its answer to Best Buy's Geek Squad last July through Smart Home Services by Amazon, offering consultations on what smart home products are best for consumers' homes as well as installations.  However, some consumers are uncomfortable with Amazon being in their living rooms all the time in the form of smart devices, likely hindering the service's success. With Home Assistants regularly in consumers' houses, they may be more apt to use Home Services and buy Amazon smart products, like the Echo, because Amazon will be a constant presence in their lives. This, in turn, could improve Amazon's standing in the smart home industry.", "stock": "AMZN"}, {"url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-ecobee-investment-2018-3", "label": 1, "source": "business-insider", "date": "2018-03-08", "article": "BII  This story was delivered to BI Intelligence IoT Briefing subscribers hours before it appeared on Business Insider. To be the first to know, please click here.  Amazon's Alexa fund recently participated in a $62 million Series C funding round into 11-year-old smart home device manufacturer Ecobee, according to CNBC. The funding round was led by Energy Impact Partners.  The Toronto-based company primarily makes smart thermostats, but also sells sensor packages that can pair with the thermostats to help users manage hot and cold spots in their homes, and recently announced it will soon sell smart light switches. The Alexa fund, which Amazon launched back in late 2015, invests in third-party hardware companies and help them make their devices compatible with Alexa, or, in some cases, embed Alexa into their devices.  The Alexa fund was also one of the lead investors in the Series B round Ecobee completed back in 2016, and last year the device maker introduced a new thermostat that has Alexa embedded in it. This latest funding round brings the Ecobee's total funding to $146 million. Thomvest and Relay Ventures, two US-based venture firms, joined Amazon in leading the investment.  Amazon's investment comes shortly after it purchased video doorbell makers Ring and Blink, and considered buying smart lock maker August. The e-commerce titan is clearly interested in broadening its footprint in the smart home market, and likely hopes to leverage the immense popularity of its Echo smart speakers to get its users to purchase devices from companies it has acquired or invested in.  Its ongoing support of Ecobee suggests that the company is at least exploring the idea of adding smart thermostats, sensors, and light switches to its own product suite, which would allow it to build a more complete smart home ecosystem around the Echo products.  Ecobee's primary competitor in the smart thermostat space is Alphabet-owned Nest, and given that Amazon decided to stop selling Nest products through its marketplace last week, it will likely target Ecobee's devices at customers on its e-commerce site who otherwise might have purchased Nest products. Amazon may eventually look to purchase Ecobee outright the way it did with Blink and Ring, though it's unclear whether the younger firm is looking to sell.  Amazon, however, still faces an uphill battle in a fragmented market long plagued by slow growth. The company likely hopes that it can convince its loyalists and other mass-market consumers to buy smart home devices, ultimately growing the overall market. But the consumer IoT space has seen slow adoption, and many companies are struggling to turn a profit.  Meanwhile, Amazon will need to confront a fragmented market with legacy home device makers like GE and Honeywell, as well as Nest, which now has its own long line of smart home devices along with its flagship thermostats.  Amazon may struggle to turn a profit in this difficult market, but the company takes heavy losses in many other business segments, and likely finds the data it could collect on consumers' habits through its smart home devices an enticing incentive to compete. That data could be valuable for its core e-commerce business, as well as new initiatives like its recently reported package delivery service.  The US smart home market has still yet to meet the expectations many observers had in the early part of this decade.  The same issues BI Intelligence first identified back in 2015 still plague the space \u2014 persistently high prices, technological fragmentation, and consumers' lack of a perceived benefit from the devices.

The Amazon Echo, released in 2014, has become immensely popular and capable, awakening users to the utility of both voice control and smart home devices. This has prompted companies to rush to release competing devices and integrate voice control into their smart home ecosystems.

In finance world, when you hire an advisor who is a fiduciary \u2014 he\u2019s legally bound to put your financial interests ahead of his.  There are many paths to business success and financial models that go with it. You can make money directly from the end user or you can find an interested third party who\u2019s interests you serve \u2014 advertisers, financiers, CIOs, employers are often the real customers while the end user is reduced to a metric.  We are seeing this play out as ad driven businesses compete with the likes of Apple and Amazon . In B2B, companies that sell primarily to the CIO and procurement are competing with the new age of SaaS players that are often selling direct to the line of business or even the individual user.  What makes companies like Apple and Amazon unique?  Apple\u2019s business model relies almost entirely on revenue earned directly from the consumer. Even when you are buying 3rd party apps, you are buying them from Apple \u2014 and Apple ensures that they are safe, secure and work as advertised.  Amazon and Jeff Bezos are single mindedly focused on delivering value to the consumer \u2014 they too make their revenue and profits by selling directly to you. Recently, they have added other revenue sources like advertising but that is far from the dominant source of income.  Meanwhile, any company that earns its living primarily by charging some other third party \u2014 advertisers, brokers, etc. \u2014 is not a fiduciary. They may be incented to do the right thing for the consumer but at the end of the day they can often cut corners.  The Unbeatable Edge  As Apple enters markets like health and finance, they come in with the benefit of consumer\u2019s trust. It shows in their business model and it shows in their product \u2014 even technology architecture.  For example, the credit card you store in your Apple Wallet is never visible to Apple. They are applying a similar approach to your health data in the newly announced health records on your iPhone. They don\u2019t need to make money from the pharma companies or the hospitals. They serve your needs directly.  Since they make so much of their money from you by charging you for phones and additional apps and services, they don\u2019t need to sell or even use your data for businesses that are not aligned with the end users.  Trillion Dollar SaaS Market  The massive shift to SaaS can be viewed from the technology lens of multitenancy and serverless but at the core of the move to SaaS is the ability for the end user or line of business to directly buy the apps it needs.  The legacy on premise vendors built products focused more on the needs of the CIO and the needs of the business were often poorly served. Companies like Salesforce and Workday sold directly to the line of business changing the game forever.  Netflix and TV  When viewed through the fiduciary lens, you realize why Netflix is so powerful \u2014 every person in the company is focused on delivering entertainment to you the subscriber. There are no advertisers and no cable company middlemen dictating what they think is good for the consumer.  An ad free business is not just great TV, it aligns incentives in unique ways that create a moat that\u2019s hard to beat.  The Next Generation of Fiduciary Companies  As we look to the next generation of startups, here are some companies whose business model is well aligned with the end users.  AirbBnB : makes money when both renter and host are happy over the long term. Unlike Expedia and Priceline, that serve some very large customers and have a somewhat transactional relationship with the consumer.  : makes money when both renter and host are happy over the long term.

Lyft and Uber : In the long run, the winners in this category will have to serve the consumers and drivers well. The rise of Lyft was enabled by Uber\u2019s missteps on this alignment and how it treated its drivers.  : In the long run, the winners in this category will have to serve the consumers and drivers well. The rise of Lyft was enabled by Uber\u2019s missteps on this alignment and how it treated its drivers. Wealthfront: With a transparent fee structure, and no under the cover fees, Wealthfront is to the younger generation what Vanguard was the last \u2014 one of the few financial services company that is truly honest and aligned with the users.  Challenges  No business model is isolated from misuse and abuse. Even with the fiduciary model, companies are often putting someone else\u2019s interest ahead of yours \u2014 their own. One could easily argue that the closed content ecosystem of Apple and Amazon Alexa are examples of the companies maximizing their own self-interest.  What should a founder do?  When you are starting a company and want to build something for the long term, take the time to think through who your actual customer is vs the user. The more aligned the person writing the check is with the needs of your end user the better.  And even when your business relies on advertising or a CIO or a procurement officer \u2014 build a culture of doing the right thing by the true end user. Companies that work as a fiduciary build lifetime moats that are hard to beat.  The best startups I have invested in or advised like ProsperWorks, Workato and Algolia are doing just that.", "stock": "AMZN"}, {"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/04/03/amazon-opens-echo-button-games-to-developers/", "label": 1, "source": "techcrunch", "date": "2018-04-04", "article": "Echo Buttons are one of the stranger bits of hardware to come out of the Amazon labs in recent memory.

After its acquisition of Blink just two months ago, Amazon is now buying Ring, makers of the self-titled Ring doorbell (plus a bunch of other security gear, like solar security cameras, floodlight cams, and an in-home alarm system).

The resulting audio can be played from within the blog post itself, or accessed in podcast form using a feature called Amazon Pollycast, the company says.  The plugin itself was jointly designed by Amazon\u2019s AWS team and managed WordPress platform provider WP Engine, and takes advantage of Amazon\u2019s text-to-speech service, Polly.  First introduced at Amazon\u2019s re:Invent developer event back in November 2016, Polly uses machine learning technologies under the hood to deliver more life-like speech. For example, Polly understands that the word \u201clive\u201d would be pronounced differently based on its usage. In the phrases \u201cI live in Seattle\u201d and \u201cLive from New York,\u201d the word is spelled the same but is not spoken in the same way. That means the voices sound more natural than some other, more basic voice-to-text engines.  The Polly speech engine launched with 47 male and female voice and support for 24 languages. Since then, Amazon added support for Korean, another 5 languages, and made Polly available in all regions in the AWS partition.  The technology\u2019s capabilities have also evolved, with added support for things like whispering, speech marks, a timbre effect, and dynamic range compression. These sorts of voice technology advancements are also things that make Alexa sound more natural, too. Similar to Polly, Alexa learned how to whisper and change the pitch of her voice earlier this year.  The launch of the WordPress plugin is not the first time Polly has been used to turn digital text to speech, of course. The service itself has always been capable of turning any text \u2013 news articles, blog posts, RSS feeds, PDFs, and more \u2013 into audio. However, making this functionality available as a WordPress plugin makes Polly more accessible to a wider audience.  However, the plugin is only available to anyone running their own installation of WordPress on their own infrastructure (hosted or managed) or on AWS, and does require a bit of configuration. That may make it a bit more challenging for less technical types to use. (Instructions are here on the Amazon developer blog and on the plugin\u2019s page.)  Once set up, the plugin makes calls to Amazon Polly whenever a blog post is saved or updated.  In addition to simply reading posts aloud, Polly\u2019s flexibility means you could configure different voices for different bylines, or use different voices for quoted text \u2013 if you\u2019re technically-minded \u2013 these options aren\u2019t available in the plugin itself. (Users can choose from the full selection of Amazon Polly voices to narrate different bylines using the plugin. However, they can\u2019t have different voices in the same reading.)  For podcasters, the plugin includes a feature called Pollycast that lets you control the iTunes parameters that are in the generated RSS feed, like the iTunes category, image, contact email, and explicit content flag.  The Amazon Polly plugin is free, but using Polly is not.  Pricing is based on the number of characters in the speech requests. It\u2019s also worth noting the AWS free tier allows up to 5 million characters per month at no charge for the first year after you begin to use Polly.", "stock": "AMZN"}, {"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/01/17/amazon-launches-autoscaling-service-on-aws/", "label": -1, "source": "techcrunch", "date": "2018-01-17", "article": "One of the primary advantages of cloud computing has always been the ability to scale up to meet short-term needs and scale back when that need has been met. In other words, you don\u2019t have to pay for infrastructure that you don\u2019t need to hedge against heavy usage. That has mostly meant server capacity, but over time it has been applied to other cloud services. Now, developers can configure auto scaling across a set of AWS services in a single unified interface.  Companies typically use multiple AWS services to build their applications, and up until now that required some work to make sure the various pieces were scaling as the application required it. In a company blog post announcing the new feature, Amazon\u2019s Jeff Barr explained how the new service greatly simplifies auto-scaling for developers.  \u201cYou no longer need to set up alarms and scaling actions for each resource and each service. Instead, you simply point AWS Auto Scaling at your application and select the services and resources of interest. Then you select the desired scaling option for each one, and AWS Auto Scaling will do the rest, helping you to discover the scalable resources and then creating a scaling plan that addresses the resources of interest,\u201d Barr wrote in the blog post.  The new service gives developers a set of auto-scaling options, offering a way to balance cost, availability or a combination of the two, depending on your company\u2019s and the application\u2019s specific requirements. As you set up a given scaling threshold, AWS Auto Scaling actually can create a set of scaling policies automatically, based on your configuration.  The way it works is you select an application, then create a scaling configuration plan where you set scaling targets for each resource.

The e-commerce giant has cut the field of candidates to 20 prime locations to complement its Seattle base, including Atlanta, Dallas and New York. Hundreds of cities hoped Amazon would think outside the box, but a desire for talent and a welcoming environment led it to the usual hot spots.  The company, led by Jeff Bezos, started the process in typically innovative fashion in September by issuing an unusual and very public request for proposals. Fully 238 localities in the United States, Canada and Mexico submitted bids, lured by the prospect of $5 billion in investment and a promised 50,000 jobs with compensation averaging over $100,000 each.  Distressed cities like Detroit and Hartford marshaled civic and business leaders to make their cases, seeing the investment as a chance to transform their economic prospects. New Jersey\u2019s former governor Chris Christie dressed up Newark\u2019s bid with $7 billion in potential tax breaks. The contest even prompted the mayor of Stonecrest, an Atlanta suburb, to rename the town Amazon and make Mr. Bezos mayor for life if he chose the town.  With the exception of Newark, most have come away empty-handed. That\u2019s not a surprise given Amazon\u2019s criteria of a large metropolitan area, a strong pool of technical talent, a business-friendly environment and good transportation links. But it\u2019s disappointing that with the exception of a couple of outsiders like Indianapolis and Columbus, Ohio, the company\u2019s finalists \u2014 which also include Austin, Tex., Boston, Los Angeles, Toronto and the suburbs of Washington \u2014 are just about everyone else\u2019s, too.  A conventional choice will no doubt serve Amazon well. Meanwhile, the innovative ideas the bidding process inspired among politicians and business executives around the country might just prompt other companies to think farther outside the box.", "stock": "AMZN"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/18/technology/amazon-finalists-headquarters.html", "label": 1, "source": "the-new-york-times", "date": "2018-01-18", "article": "Hans Riemer, president of the Montgomery County Council, found out from a friend via text message.  \u201cMy heart skipped a beat,\u201d he said.

Ms. Bowser said Amazon\u2019s selection of Montgomery County and Northern Virginia \u2014 both near Washington \u2014 spoke to the appeal of the region\u2019s work force.  \u201cOf course,\u201d she added, \u201cwe believe that Washington, D.C. \u2014 with our top talent and world-class amenities \u2014 is the right place for Amazon HQ2.\u201d  Mayor Baraka said that Newark has a \u201cfriendly rivalry\u201d with its bigger neighbor, New York, while adding that his city enjoys the advantages of cheaper real estate, space for development in its downtown and lots of fiber optic network capacity.  Photo  Amazon needs a second headquarters because it\u2019s bursting at the seams in its hometown, Seattle. Mr. Bezos founded the company there in 1994, and it has since transformed the city, employing more than 40,000 there. That expansion has also contributed to Seattle\u2019s soaring cost of living and its traffic woes.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  To lure applicants, Amazon showered local politicians with its own data about the effect the company has had on the Seattle economy, and some of the immediate economic benefits its second home would experience \u2014 including $5 billion in construction spending.  It asked candidates to include in their bids a variety of detailed information, including potential building sites, crime and traffic stats and nearby recreational opportunities. Amazon also asked cities and states to describe the tax incentives available to offset its costs for building and operating its second headquarters. The most eye-popping of those offers was New Jersey\u2019s promise of up to $7 billion in tax incentives to bring Amazon to Newark.  Another tech giant, Apple, this week said it, too, was hunting for a location to build a major new campus. But the company\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, said it would not conduct a public bidding process akin to Amazon\u2019s. He said California and Texas were unlikely locations for the new campus because Apple already has significant operations there.  Amazon\u2019s search process has also attracted critics. Stacy Mitchell, co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a nonprofit organization that serves as an advocate for local businesses, said that politicians were enhancing Amazon\u2019s image just as the company\u2019s market power was under growing scrutiny from groups like her own.  \u201cAs these cities woo and grovel, they are basically communicating this idea that we should want Amazon to be bigger and more powerful in our economy,\u201d Ms. Mitchell said.  Ed Glaeser, a professor of economics at Harvard who studies cities, predicted that the winner of the contest would have in place the kind of positive economic attributes that mean it wouldn\u2019t necessarily need Amazon to thrive.  \u201cAt its best, the competition for Amazon has spurred cities to think about how to improve their quality of life more generally,\u201d he said. \u201cAt its worst, the competition has become a distraction and a contest for throwing cash at the giant.\u201d", "stock": "AMZN"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/business/dealbook/amazon-buys-ring.html", "label": -1, "source": "the-new-york-times", "date": "2018-02-27", "article": "Luke Schoenfelder, chief executive of Latch, a start-up that makes a family of smart locks, said he believed that Amazon would make a more serious effort to enter the home security market and compete against companies like ADT, Comcast and Alarm.com.

People who want to use them to record video must pay for that capability, with plans starting at $3 a month or $30 a year. The company also makes stand-alone security cameras.  Amazon has taken some baby steps into home security. Last year it began selling an indoor security camera of its own design, Amazon Cloud Cam, and in December it acquired Blink, a maker of inexpensive internet security cameras and doorbells.  A service called Amazon Key uses cameras and internet-connected door locks to allow delivery people to drop orders inside customers\u2019 homes.  Google, one of Amazon\u2019s biggest rivals, is also an increasingly important player in home automation and security, with its Nest thermostats and security cameras.  James McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research, said he believed that Amazon had bought Ring so it could add more intelligent capabilities to its doorbells and cameras, like the ability to use software to recognize faces at the front door.

But as geeks and early adopters of technology, we do like what it stands for. It\u2019s a mere party trick at times.  When they launched it in the US, Amazon's Echo devices were a revelation for everyone. They seemed like an essential step towards a home we've only seen in science fiction movies. A speaker that listens, understands and responds - wow!  It's been a few years now and the dust has settled. Amazon sells a whole host of these smart devices and three of these entered India last year.  But for any kind of AI, India is a different beast altogether. Smart as they might be, they are awfully dumb in India, or at least that's what I personally think.  It's been months since I first ordered my Echo Dot, and just about a month with the Echo. And as one of the first Indian customers to own one of these devices, I can honestly say I love it. Yet, I also have to admit that it's a device that raises more questions than it answers.  Using the Echo  The larger Echo Plus is the most powerful of Amazon's three offerings here. But the biggest difference between that and the Echo is that the latter controls smart homes. I don't need that because the lights and appliances in my home are surely dumb.  So, I have an Echo. A cylindrical, fairly sleek speaker that can speak. It plays music when I tell it to, reads the news if I want, even tries to book an Uber for me and get me restaurant recommendations. Neat.  I bought the Echo Dot first and I was in awe in the first few days of using it. The accent was Indian, it recognised my voice without fail and had me do things I never thought I needed. But those were the initial days and the novelty wore off rather quickly.  With the Echo, you basically get better audio quality than the Dot, which is essential for those buying this as a speaker rather than a smart device.  But if you're buying this as a speaker first, you aren't using its strengths. This is the second generation Echo and it would work well for average listeners. Yet, it doesn't sound as good as the (similarly priced) UE Wonderboom. Bass-heavy songs are somewhat underwhelming, while high and mid frequencies aren't very well defined either.  As a portable speaker, the Echo does the job for regular listeners. But if you're used to the kind of speakers I mentioned above, the 2.5\" (downfiring) woofer and 0.6\" (upward firing) tweeter aren't enough.  Amazon never meant for this to be an audio device in the first place. It's all about the AI inside. In the nearly four months that I've used it, Alexa has understood my commands 80% of the time, better than Siri has ever done for me, and up to the standards set by the Google Assistant.  But here's the thing, in the last two months, all I've ever told Alexa to do is \"Play Music\". Nowadays, I actually play music over Bluetooth and use my voice only to \"stop\" or \"increase volume\". Amazon added 12,000 skills to Alexa (in India) since October, but nothing that I really need. You can check out our selection of the best Alexa Skills in our comprehensive rundown.  For instance, when I try to book an Uber, Alexa insists on it being a cash trip, even though my payment information is neatly set up inside the Uber app.  When I ask for a podcast, Alexa returns the voice equivalent of a blank face, because the functionality is apparently not available in India. Somehow, I can still play podcasts from Tune In manually, though.  Next, I ask Alexa to play a song and it confidently plays some cover of the song instead. It reads the news in a monotonous robotic voice, severely reducing the number of news sources I can choose from, and so on. Also, I can't just ask for news from one news source yet, it will play my entire news briefing whenever I do. That's one of the features available overseas, but not in India.  Oh, and the most annoying, when I say \"Alexa, play music\", it plays the same few playlists again and again. I try refining my search by saying \"Alexa, play Blues\", but that doesn't really get me very far either. I always end up having to resort to my phone.  There's one last case I'd point out. I told Alexa to order an item \"I usually order\". The AI successfully recognised what I order, but instead of ordering it to the address I usually get delivery on, it decided my default address is the way to go. An unusually dumb thing for a \"smart\" assistant to do. Why can Amazon read my order, but not recognise my behaviour?  So it's bad?  All that I have just mentioned makes the Echo a device I do not need. You know what though? It's a device I really want. Over the past four months, I've developed the habit of playing a podcast when I go to bed, asking for a song when I wake up and asking for weather updates when I get out. Things I never did earlier, with my dumb speakers. I don't regret buying the Echo Dot. It adds some much-needed smarts to my dumb Harman Kardon Soundsticks III.  Connecting to Bluetooth is much smoother with Alexa. I just say, \"Alexa, connect to Bluetooth\". I really appreciate not having to pick up my phone to skip a song (when I'm playing over Bluetooth). I could go on.  What I'm really saying is, you have to be a geek like me to even think of buying the Echo in India. And even then, you should buy the Echo Dot and make your legacy system smarter. The Echo Dot is the smartest wireless dongle I've ever used and compared to all others, it's the most useful.  For the early adopters  In short, Echo speakers in India are early adopter devices. They are neither perfect nor useful. But Amazon's betting it can change your mind. Early adopters like me are giving the company the data it needs to improve, and Amazon's voice assistant has made a much better start in India than all its competitors (You listening, Apple?).  I wouldn't even expect regular improvements here. Frankly, I'm a little annoyed that India still doesn't have an Amazon Music app. It would have been so much easier to create my own playlists and just direct Alexa to them. I've actually created a library of 50-60 odd songs using my voice alone, but it's tedious.  Does Alexa learn?  For Amazon, it's important that Alexa learns. That's how the company will know what products you're likely to buy. So, it's inevitable that Alexa will learn eventually, failing which, it will die. But I've seen no real signs of learning over the past four months.  Amazon has set up Indian versions of Alexa to play Indian tracks when you ask for music. But, it took Alexa about two days to recognise that I listen to western music more. Now, when I request music, the AI starts with an English playlist. If I say I don't like the playlist it chose, it goes to another, shuffling about four playlists before telling me to listen to Karan Johar songs.  While that is indeed a sign of intelligent learning, you will realise it's not. What I found over time, is that if I say \"Play music\", Alexa just cycles through a pre-selected collection of playlists, coming full circle quickly. A particularly annoying aspect that makes me just play music over Bluetooth all the time.  Amazon may have added a bunch of skills over time, but this particular aspect of Alexa is particularly worrisome. Perhaps the company is just working out the bugs before it can start \"learning\".  Speaking to the Echo  My bedroom is small, so I never have to raise my voice for commands. My indoor voice works just fine. But, I keep the Echo close to my TV, and it often fails to pick up the wake word (Alexa) when the TV is playing at above average volumes. This can be a problem if you're using the Dot as a dongle though. Unless you have an exceedingly long AUX cable, the Dot would be quite close to your speakers, and will hence fail to hear you when playing loud music. This only happens at really loud volumes though, something few would face.  I've successfully barked commands to Alexa from my kitchen, on occasion. The seven far field mics that both the Echo and Echo Dot have, pick up your voice quite easily.  Setting up the Echo  The easiest part of using the Echo devices is setting them up. The initial Wi-Fi connection takes a few minutes, but you never have to touch settings after that. After downloading the Alexa app, you put your Echo on pairing mode and connect to WiFi, and that's that.  Build and Design  The Echo is short and fat, wrapped in a similar fabric (you don't get the wood versions in India yet) as Google's Daydream VR. It's reasonably pretty and I don't think it will hamper the style quotient of any media centre. And though it's not meant to be portable, it's light enough to carry around in a pinch.  Our Verdict  If you're asking me whether the Echo is a device you need, the answer is a firm no. But, the geek in me really does like this device. It's nowhere close to being powerful in India yet and is meant only for the early adopters, who've been saving money ever since this first launched overseas. The Echo Dot is good for turning a dumb speaker smart, but that's about all I can say about the Echo line.", "stock": "AMZN"}, {"url": "http://www.techradar.com/reviews/amazon-echo-spot", "label": -1, "source": "techradar", "date": "2018-01-16", "article": "The Amazon Echo Spot is the best-looking Echo product out there: a versatile, Alexa-toting video device that wants to be in your bedroom, your kitchen, your office...  Amazon\u2019s latest Echo refresh has brought with it a design flourish that was sorely missing from its original line-up.  We\u2019ll get straight to it: the Amazon Echo Spot is the best-designed Alexa device Amazon has ever created; it\u2019s a gadget you\u2019d happily have in your bedroom, on your desk, in your kitchen.  The new form factor makes Alexa feel fresh again, giving the voice AI some much-needed purpose.  The Amazon Echo Spot is versatile - it doesn\u2019t have a chameleon-like ability to adapt to the room you put it in but this is certainly not just a smart alarm clock, something Amazon has been very clear about.  Design  The issue is, it looks like a smart alarm clock which means that this may become its default use for many, but its use stretches beyond that.  The Amazon Echo Spot is unlike any other Echo device and that is a good thing. Its curved shell does more than enough to make up for its sibling\u2019s design failings.  Where the big, bulky and brash Amazon Echo Show took over any area you put it in, no thanks to its brutalist black slab look, the Echo Spot is much more refined in its design.  Surprisingly it turns out the best way to do a desk-based video device is to forgo the TV-lite look and just go with something that is compact and looks good.  The Echo Spot is a cross between an Echo Dot and a smaller version of the Amazon Show.  This is no Echo Dot replacement, though - the price puts it out of contention for that, and it\u2019s also a lot more useful, so to say it is would be doing it a disservice.  Size-wise, it\u2019s the equivalent of a mango. Mangos aren\u2019t the most scientific way to measure things, sure, but at least it gives you an indication that it\u2019s a pretty compact device with a curved back and screen that\u2019s angled up, which makes it easy to view.  It\u2019s a great-looking device, certainly something you won't mind having on show in your home unlike the, er, Show.  Features and setup  The unit we reviewed was black but there is also a white one available. The screen is small, at 2.5 inches (480\u00d7480 pixels).  On the top of the screen there is space for a camera and on the top of the device as a whole there are three buttons.  Anyone familiar with the Echo range will know what they are: volume up, down and mute for the mic - this will also disable the camera. There are also four small pin-prick holes. These house the four-array mics that listen out for the wake word.  On the back you have a nice bit of Amazon branding and a slot for power and a 3.5mm jack.  The speaker grill for the Spot is right at the base of the device, which makes it invisible when viewing the Spot face-on. Bluetooth functionality is also available.  Setup is similar to other Echo devices, except for this one you can type in your Wi-Fi details straight on the screen, instead of going through the Alexa app.  It\u2019s a little bit fiddly putting in your details that way (it will ask for your Amazon account password, too) but the whole process will take less than five minutes.  Once up and running, you have the option to watch Amazon\u2019s promo video which tells you what you can do with the device. It\u2019s not a masterpiece but it\u2019s worth sitting through so you get an idea just what you\u2019ve bought.  Then you get that warm chime sound, which means Alexa is up and running. Once this appears it\u2019s a good time to read our best Amazon Alexa Skills article or you could follow the prompts that come up on the screen. Or you can swipe right on the screen and that will bring up a whole load of Alexa commands you can use. It\u2019s a really nice way to learn what to do with Alexa. If you're looking for some fun and silly extras, give our Alexa Easter Eggs list a try, too.  These prompts can be turned off in the settings. It\u2019s in the settings where you can toggle home cards on an off also. The home cards are information that comes up on the home screen.  You can have the home screen include your messages, weather, notifications, upcoming events, reminders, drop in and trending topics.", "stock": "AMZN"}, {"url": "http://www.techradar.com/news/amazon-great-indian-sale-2018-top-deals", "label": 1, "source": "techradar", "date": "2018-01-24", "article": "Amazon is about to wrap up its ongoing Amazon Great Indian sale.

There's wooden capping that compliments the look of these headphones. Also, the quality of material used for the chords is pretty fine. Audio is not the best in its segment but not bad for the price either.  Buy Logitech X50 Bluetooth speaker on Amazon @ Rs 1,199 Amazon usually sells the Logitech X50 for Rs 1,299, which is a good price for this Bluetooth speaker. Right now, you can get a Rs 100 discount on it, which makes it the best Bluetooth speaker deal at this price.  Buy Sennheiser CX 275 S in-ear headphones on Amazon @ Rs 1,499 If you need a better in-ear headphone than the CX 180 and price is not a problem, then CX 275 is the next good option. The audio is well balanced, has enough bass and doesn't mute or overpower tones. It delivers shrill sound, which powers vocals and high frequency tones.  Buy Mi Basic in-ear on Amazon @ Rs 499 Mi Basic is the most affordable in-ear from Xiaomi, which is pretty good for its price too. The quality of material is sturdy and lightweight and the fit is also comfortable. For after sale support, we would recommend Sennheiser CX 180 over this but this seems more durable in terms of build quality.  Buy Logitech M235 Wireless Mouse on Amazon @ Rs 579 Logitech M235 is the first name that comes to our mind when it comes to recommending most basic and dependable wireless mouse. It is cheap for the quality it offers and you can use it for years without a fail.  Buy Sony SRS-XB10 Bluetooth Speaker on Amazon @ Rs 3,074 The Sony SRS-XB10 is made for EDM lovers, as it delivers extra bass and punchy tones. At 3,074, it is a good and portable option to have but carrying it in bag or pockets is a problem because of its can-like design.  Buy Sony MDR-EX150AP on Amazon @ Rs 899 Sony is a dependable name when it comes to audio equipments but out of all the affordable products it has, the MDR-EX150 AP is a good option if you want a better balance over bassy sound.", "stock": "AMZN"}, {"url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/amazon-buys-ring-in-another-move-to-get-into-your-house", "label": -1, "source": "techradar", "date": "2018-02-27", "article": "Amazon has bought Ring, a smart home tech company that makes video doorbells and other security devices. The acquisition, first reported by GeekWire, gives Amazon yet another way into your house.  The terms of the agreement haven't yet been disclosed, though reports pin the acquisition price at more than $1 billion. As when it bought Twitch in 2014, Amazon is expected to keep Ring running as-is, meaning the brand and its products are sticking around. Amazon will, however, integrate Ring's technologies into other products and services where it makes sense.  \"Ring is committed to our mission to reduce crime in neighborhoods by providing effective yet affordable home security tools to our Neighbors that make a positive impact on our homes, our communities, and the world,\" a Ring spokesperson said in a statement to TechRadar. \"We'll be able to achieve even more by partnering with an inventive, customer-centric company like Amazon. We look forward to being a part of the Amazon team as we work toward our vision for safer neighborhoods.\"  Opening the door  Ring fits well into Amazon's smart home vertical, led by the Amazon Echo smart speaker line. Amazon also has a security camera, the Cloud Cam, and a service called Amazon Key. Amazon Key caused a stir when it was announced as it gives couriers access to your home to drop off packages when you're not there. It still has its detractors.  Amazon's push into our homes isn't limited to its own products and services, of course. Its Alexa assistant has crossed over to numerous third-party smart home devices, including some built by Ring. In June 2017, Ring announced that select Ring Video Doorbells and Security Cameras could be accessed by talking to an Amazon Echo Show or Amazon Fire TV.  Speaking to today's announcement, an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement:  \"Ring's home security products and services have delighted customers since day one. We're excited to work with this talented team and help them in their mission to keep homes safe and secure.\"  Ring isn't the first smart doorbell company Amazon has purchased, either. In December, Amazon bought Blink, a startup that makes wireless video doorbells and security cameras.  With yet another video doorbell company under its belt, Google, Amazon's chief rival in the smart home space, is likely looking on with interest. The search giant recently brought smart cam company Nest back under its wing, and the two are poised to develop more ways to integrate the Google voice assistant, Google Assistant, into more products.  Which will emerge as our favorite supplier of smart home products, Amazon or Google? The answer isn't clear yet, but these two are taking the fight right to your doorstep.", "stock": "AMZN"}, {"url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/samsung-carnival-on-amazon-up-to-rs-8000-cashback-as-amazon-pay-balance", "label": 1, "source": "techradar", "date": "2018-03-06", "article": "Samsung has announced the Samsung Carnival sale on Amazon India, providing an option to buyers to avail of attractive discounts, cashbacks and No Cost EMI option on their next Samsung smartphone.

Earlier this week, the JioPhone was listed on MobiKwik, making it the first third party seller to sell the JioPhone. Before this, the JioPhone could be booked only from the MyJio app and the company\u2019s official website.  If you book the device from MobiKwik, you would have to go and collect the device from Reliance Digital but if you order the device from Amazon, the JioPhone will be delivered to your house. However, you will still have to go to Reliance Digital to get your device activated using your Aadhaar card.  To order the JioPhone, all you need to do is go to the product page and add the device to card. Then, make payment and once you receive the device, take the device and your Aadhaar card to your nearest Reliance Digital to activate your Jio connection.  The JioPhone is a 4G feature phone that was launched by Reliance Jio in July and went on sale online in August. The company started selling the device through its offline retailers in September.

Amazon\u2019s Prime Instant Video service has also been working on plenty of great, original content over the past few years, giving much of its licensed programming a run for its money and rivaling Netflix in the bid to be the top streaming service on the web.  So with that in mind, we\u2019re taking a good look at what\u2019s definitely on the cards over the next few months, as well as some of the latest speculations about the original content that will be on the way in the not-so-distant future, from a refresh of Conan The Barbarian, through to Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett\u2019s highly-anticipated Good Omens.  Carnival Row  Carnival Row looks like the stuff our dark fantasy dreams are made of, with fairies, mythical creatures and creepy killings all set against a backdrop of a neo-Victorian city called Burque. The show already has a star-studded cast with Cara Delevingne playing some kind of fairy and Orlando Bloom playing a police officer investigating a series of murders.  Paul McGuigan, best known for directing movies like Lucky Number Slevin and Push, will be at the helm of the new TV show, which will consist of ten episodes. Amazon hasn\u2019t released many more details yet, but production is expected to start in late 2018, with a 2019 release date reportedly on the cards.  When? 2019 (unofficially)  A sneak peek of John Krasinski as Jack Ryan (Image: \u00a9 Amazon Prime)  Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan  Readers in the US will have been treated to Amazon Prime Video\u2019s first ever ad during the Super Bowl in February 2018, which finally gave us a sneak-peek of the long-awaited Jack Ryan TV series, based on Tom Clancy\u2019s spy novels.  Starring The Office\u2019s John Krasinski, the series is slated to be ten episodes long and will be the first time FBI agent Jack Ryan appears in a TV show. But it\u2019s not the first time he\u2019s been portrayed on a screen. You\u2019ve probably come across Jack Ryan many times before without knowing it \u2013 Alec Baldwin played him in The Hunt For Red October, Ben Affleck played him in The Sum Of All Fears and so did Harrison Ford in Patriot Games.  When? August 2018 (unofficially)  The Lord of The Rings  We\u2019ve had our fingers crossed for a Lord of the Rings TV show for years, but it looks like it\u2019s now finally going to happen. After some speculation about which company would be taking the reins of Tolkien\u2019s fantasy saga, it\u2019s now official that Amazon has acquired the TV rights for The Lord of the Rings books with a multi-season deal.  There\u2019s been no official word about the stories that\u2019ll be told in the TV series, but at the time of the deal an Amazon spokesperson said in a press release that it would \u201cexplore new storylines preceding J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s The Fellowship of the Ring\u201d.  When? TBC  (Image: \u00a9 Amazon Prime)  The Tick Season 1 (Part B)  The Tick is an Amazon original series that aired its first six episodes back in 2017. In February 2018, the show is back to wrap up the first season, with Peter Serafinowicz starring as the big, blue Tick and Griffin Newman as his fluttering side-kick, Arthur.  The show\u2019s pilot episode received mixed reviews when it was first released in Summer 2016. But when the first half of the season was made available a whole year later, critics fell in love with the funny, gritty, and at times bizarre, superhero story adapted from The Tick comics, created by cartoonist Ben Edlund back in the 80s.  When? 23 February 2018  Conan  Crush your enemies! It\u2019s finally here! After lots of speculation, Deadline has reported that Amazon is currently working on a new drama called Conan, which is based on the books by Robert E. Howard.  The new show will have Colony co-creator Ryan Condal at the helm as the creator and writer, alongside Game of Thrones director Miguel Sapochnik. According to early reports, the show will focus on Conan\u2019s original story taken from Howard\u2019s books, but they\u2019re the only details we have for now.  Although the story of Conan was written by Howard back in 1932, and published as a series of stories in Weird Tales magazine, it\u2019s been adapted for the screen a few times. The most popular was Conan The Barbarian, which was released in 1982 with Arnold Schwarzenegger in the lead role.  The move to create an original show about the iconic Cimmerian, alongside the news of The Lord of the Rings prequel stories, points to a big fantasy world-building focus for Amazon. This is hardly surprising given the huge success of Game of Thrones, which many critics believe the streaming platforms will try and ride the wave of with their own fantasy genre offerings.  When? TBC  Good Omens will be available on Amazon Prime Video in 2019 (Image: \u00a9 Amazon Prime )  Good Omens  In 2017 Amazon lifted the lid on its plans for a TV series adaptation of Neil Gaiman and Terry Prachett\u2019s fantasy novel, Good Omens. Although the show isn\u2019t set to be released until 2019, leaked images of David Tennant, Michael Sheen and Jon Hamm in character have been already been causing a stir among fans.  Those who loved the novel will be happy to hear Neil Gaiman has also written the six-part series, which is being produced by BBC Studios with Doctor Who and Outlander director Douglas Mackinnon at the helm.  When? 2019  Sneaky Pete Season 2  Sneaky Pete is a crime drama created by writer and producer David Shore, of House and The Good Doctor fame, and superstar actor, director and screenwriter Bryan Cranston. It follows the story of Marius, played by Giovanni Ribisi, a released convict who assumes the life of his cell-mate in order to escape his past life.  Interestingly, the pilot for the show was originally developed for CBS, but the network dropped it before it aired. But this setback obviously didn\u2019t stop the show going ahead because it was quickly snapped up by Amazon. Judging from the great reviews the first season received, that was a very wise move on Amazon\u2019s part and the second season promises to be just as good.

Two years ago that trip into the world of pixels and cell shaders took the world\u2019s largest retailer into the game development space with a game called Breakaway, and last year\u2019s big play included the acquisition of game streaming juggernaut Twitch.  Today Amazon announced its next big leap in video games: competitive gaming \u2013 specifically, a new competitive gaming service called GameOn.  GameOn will integrate with some mobile titles you already know and play to offer you real-world rewards from the Amazon Store. (Think eSports rewards but for the people who can only invest a few hours in a game each week rather than a few dozen.)  Amazon\u2019s GameOn currently supports leaderboards, leagues and multi-round competitions and, for games with an engaged community, can also enable players and streamers to create their own user-generated competitions and invite participants to join in on the competition.

When it goes into full effect, Amazon\u2019s GameOn service will be great for gamers \u2013 as it rewards you with goods from Amazon for the games you\u2019re already playing \u2013 but it does require that developers sign on with the service, a potentially costly endeavor as Amazon plans on charging $0.003 per play.

The Echo range of smart speakers are now available for pre-order on Amazon Australia with the units going on sale early February. And with them comes our own true-blue Alexa, with what we can only assume is going to be a fair dinkum Aussie accent.  Getting smart  Alexa is Amazon\u2019s own digital assistant, the voice behind the Echo range of speakers and bitter rival of Google's own smart assistant ecosystem, currently comprised of the Google Home and Google Home Mini.  With these speakers you can play music, get weather updates, set alarms, keep tabs on your appointments, control your lights and do plenty more.  Amazon Echo was the first model to launch. With a 2.5-inch woofer, a dedicated tweeter, 360-degree audio and Dolby sound, it\u2019s a capable standalone smart speaker for any home.  The Echo Plus does everything the Echo can but comes packing a smart home hub that makes connecting to your smart home devices easy.  The Echo Dot is the baby of the bunch and is a great way to smarten up the home at an affordable cost.  Pricing and availability  The Echo, Echo Dot and Echo Plus are available to pre-order on Amazon for $149, $79 and $229 respectively. The smart speakers go on sale in early February, and will be up for purchase at JB Hi-FI, Officeworks, Telstra and Myer.

The Echo Dot can be had for just $49, while the Echo and Echo Plus carry an introductory price tag of $119 and $199 respectively.  For anyone looking to set up multi-room smarts, getting a two-pack of Dots for just $79 means you save more, while the Echo Plus comes with a bonus Philips Hue smart bulb.  Amazon is also launching its music streaming service in Australia and New Zealand alongside the speakers.

Now, though, you could add whale sounds from Spotify to that Routine for those particularly stressful days.  Your Routines can include music from a specific artist, album, playlist or radio station and supported services currently include Amazon Music, Spotify, Deezer, TuneIn and Pandora. According to Amazon you can also create a volume action to control how quiet or loud the audio output will be.  Routine rhythms  These more well-rounded Routines appear to be part of a concentrated effort on Amazon\u2019s part to make Alexa a more personable assistant that\u2019s useful beyond single commands and actually helps you in your daily routine.

Despite the fact that Alexa was able to use Routines before Google Assistant, it\u2019s worth noting that music integration is already available in Google Routines. Google Assistant Routines can also support audiobooks and while there\u2019s no Audible support for Alexa Routines just yet, we imagine that\u2019ll be in the works too if Amazon wants to be on even footing with its rival.

How it works  Thousands of brands large and small, selling through Amazon\u2019s Marketplace seller program, are now what drives Amazon\u2019s rapid growth in ad revenue. Jijamas, founded in 2013, wouldn\u2019t exist without Amazon, says Gustavo Sanchez, the brand\u2019s co-founder and chief executive. Jijamas sells one thing: Supersoft, high-end women\u2019s pajamas.  Starting at about $70 a set, they rarely turn up near the top of search results for \u201cpajamas\u201d on Amazon, says Mr. Sanchez, since the site\u2019s algorithm favors cheaper, higher-volume goods. Even its high customer ratings only help Jijamas get so far.  The company\u2019s revenue growth is dependent on Amazon advertising, Mr. Sanchez says.  Advertising on Amazon is much like advertising on Google\u2019s AdWords platform, says Daniel Knijnik, chief executive of Quartile, a small ad agency started last August that focuses solely on Amazon. Most ads appear atop search results for various keywords.  Jijamas, a specialty line of high-end pajamas, depends on Amazon for virtually all its revenue growth. Shown, Gustavo Sanchez, the brand\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, on January 26 in New York City. Photo: Kenneth Bachor/The Wall Street Journal  Advertising plays an important role in Amazon\u2019s lucrative direct-to-consumer marketplace, where Amazon, at added cost, provides warehousing and shipping to third-party sellers. Because advertising allows brands to connect better with Amazon\u2019s shoppers, Mr. Knijnik says, even manufacturers who previously sold wholesale to Amazon are now opening their own \u201cstores\u201d on the site.  For sellers like Mr. Sanchez, advertising on Amazon is a mixed bag. A \u201csponsored\u201d listing is essential for getting products to the top of search results, which is the only surefire way to sell anything on a site that offers millions of different products. But sponsored lists are also another way Amazon skims off his profits.  Amazon wants to deliver everything you want to your doorstep, anywhere in the world. But the e-commerce giant faces several challenges in its pursuit of a global empire. WSJ's Karan Deep Singh breaks down the basics with the help of an Amazon delivery box.  On top of the 15% of an item\u2019s selling price that Mr. Sanchez pays just to list Jijamas on Amazon\u2019s marketplace, and the 5% to 6% he pays to have Amazon warehouse and ship his products, there is now up to 12% going to advertising for every item sold through an ad. This April, Amazon will start charging an additional 2% to list apparel (it hasn\u2019t disclosed why). The net result is that Amazon will take about 35% of the price of each pair of Jijamas sold through its sponsored listings.  If Amazon decides to change its search result ranking algorithms or hike its ad fees, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing I can do about it,\u201d Mr. Sanchez says. Amazon represents 65% of his total sales, he adds; the remainder comes from his own website.  Where it can grow  Amazon is continually building and buying new sources of data on our tastes and consumer behavior, from its acquisition of Whole Foods and the build-out of its cashierless Amazon Go stores to the invasion of its low-cost, voice-powered speakers and the rapid increase in its library of streaming video.  Every time Amazon racks up another percentage point of the $5 trillion U.S. retail pie, another $50 billion in the kind of data that Google and Facebook relied on disappears from their systems. Plus, Amazon understands shoppers in a way Google and Facebook might not.  \u201cAmazon doesn\u2019t just know what you buy, they also know about how you shop,\u201d says Diana Gordon, director of Shop+, the ecommerce-focused arm of WPP-owned ad firm Mindshare. \u201cThey know your browsing behavior, the cadence with which you restock certain types of consumables,\u201d she adds.  Amazon is building out not only its self-service ad business but also the sales team devoted to getting brands on board.  All of this could give Amazon an edge over Google and Facebook, but for it to scale that business, it will have to look beyond ads targeted at consumers who are already shopping on its sites.  For that, Amazon has a web-spanning advertising network just like Google\u2019s and Facebook\u2019s\u2014which is the reason a vacuum cleaner you once almost bought can haunt you for weeks on random websites. The Amazon Advertising Platform lets advertisers manage ad buys across multiple advertising exchanges, and it has quietly become as familiar to marketers as its equivalent from Google-owned DoubleClick.  Amazon is building out not only its self-service ad business but also the sales team charged with getting more brands on board. Shown, Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos in May. Photo: April Greer/The Washington Post/Getty Images  Amazon also needs to expand the number of places it can sell advertisements, which is one reason the company bought videogame-streaming behemoth Twitch and is investing so heavily in its own streaming-video offerings.  The company has been creative about where it places ads\u2014ever notice a movie ad on the side of an Amazon box shipped to your house?

AMZN -1.22% has tapped NBC Entertainment President Jennifer Salke to head Amazon Studios, its movie and television unit, succeeding Roy Price, who resigned amid allegations that he engaged in sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior toward a producer.  At Amazon, Ms. Salke, 53 years old, will oversee a deep-pocketed and ambitious online video service with an annual budget of more than $4.5 billion, according to people at the company.  Its best-known television series include \u201cTransparent,\u201d \u201cThe Tick\u201d and \u201cBosch.\u201d Its most successful films have been \u201cThe Big Sick\u201d and Oscar winner \u201cManchester by the Sea.\u201d However Amazon has struggled to find broadly popular hits like HBO\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and Netflix Inc.\u2019s \u201cStranger Things.\u201d  Among the challenges facing Ms. Salke will be improving relations with the creative community, some of whom criticized the way Amazon operated during Mr. Price\u2019s seven-year tenure. Several producers expressed frustration at what they called creative interference by Amazon executives, often leading to production delays and greater expenses. David E. Kelley, who created the legal drama \u201cGoliath\u201d for Amazon, told The Wall Street Journal last fall that the company is \u201cin way over their heads.\u201d  \u201cWhat stood out about Jen was the deep relationships she has nurtured with creators and talent over her career,\u201d Jeffrey Blackburn, the Seattle-based Amazon executive to whom Ms. Salke will report, said in a statement. \u201cShe\u2019s built an impeccable reputation as a big leader who emphasizes creativity, collaboration, and teamwork.\u201d  Since Mr. Price left in October, Amazon Studios has been overseen by Chief Operating Officer Albert Cheng, whose background is primarily in technology and digital media.  Related Video Amazon wants to deliver everything you want to your doorstep, anywhere in the world. But the e-commerce giant faces several challenges in its pursuit of a global empire. WSJ's Karan Deep Singh breaks down the basics with the help of an Amazon delivery box.  Shortly after Mr. Price stepped down, his lawyer, Eric George, said the executive had never been accused of sexual harassment \u201cwith the sole exception of the incident alleged by [the producer], the portrayal of which he vigorously contests.\u201d  The hiring of Ms. Salke, who has run NBC\u2019s prime-time entertainment since 2011, comes after a very public and drawn-out search for Mr. Price\u2019s successor. A leading candidate, Fox Television Group Chairman and Chief Executive Dana Walden, took herself out of consideration early on; another candidate\u2014A&E Networks Group Chief Executive Nancy Dubuc\u2014was also in the running. Fox\u2019s parent, 21st Century Fox Inc., shares common ownership with News Corp., which owns The Wall Street Journal.  In a statement, Ms. Salke said Amazon has \u201cinnovated, disrupted, and created characters that are already an indelible part of pop-culture.\u201d  One of Ms. Salke\u2019s biggest tasks will be overseeing Amazon\u2019s production of \u201cLord of the Rings,\u201d an ambitious and expensive series based on J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s popular fantasy novels. Amazon won a bidding war for the rights to the series, which was given a multi-season commitment.  Ms. Salke has a solid track record as a television development executive. Shows developed on her watch at NBC include the drama \u201cThis Is Us\u201d and the comedy \u201cThe Good Place.\u201d She also oversees Universal Television, the production studio at NBCUniversal which produces shows for NBC and other networks and services. NBCUniversal is a unit of Comcast Corp.  However, Ms. Salke has no experience running a world-wide digital business or in movies, both of which she will oversee in her new post. Amazon is taking a bet that she can successfully handle those new responsibilities.  Prior to joining NBC, Ms. Salke was a television-studio executive at 21st Century Fox. She started her career at Aaron Spelling Productions.  No successor for Ms. Salke was named by NBC Entertainment Chairman Robert Greenblatt. Other senior entertainment executives who will likely be under consideration include Pearlena Igbokwe, who is president of Universal Television, and NBC programming executives Bruce Evans and Lisa Katz.

With a foray into financial services, Amazon would have a chance to become an even bigger part of Americans\u2019 lives. Photo: lindsey wasson/Reuters  Amazon.com Inc. AMZN -1.22% is in talks with big banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. about building a checking-account-like product the online retailer could offer its customers, according to people familiar with the matter.  The effort is still in its early stages and may not come to fruition, the people said. The talks with financial firms are focused on creating a product that would appeal to younger customers and those without bank accounts. Whatever its final form, the initiative wouldn\u2019t involve Amazon becoming a bank, the people said.  If the product emerges, it would further inject Amazon into the lives of those who shop on its website and at its Whole Foods grocery stores, read on its Kindles, watch its streaming video and chat with Alexa, its digital assistant. Offering a product that is similar to an own-branded bank account could help reduce fees Amazon pays to financial firms and provide it with valuable data on customers\u2019 income and spending habits.  The company\u2019s latest push also answers a question that bank executives have been asking with increasing worry: When will Amazon show up on their turf?  With millions of customers, troves of data, access to cheap capital and seemingly unlimited leeway from its investors to enter new businesses, Amazon is a fearsome competitor. Its more-than $700 billion market value eclipses the combined value of JPMorgan and Bank of America Corp , the two biggest U.S. banks.  Already, Amazon is building a delivery service that one day could compete with United Parcel Service Inc. and FedEx Corp. , targeting the hospital-supplies market and considering a push into prescription drugs. Shares of companies in those industries have fallen sharply on news of Amazon\u2019s entry.  In banking, however, Amazon appears to be arriving more as a partner than a disrupter.  Last fall, it put out a request for proposals from several banks for a hybrid-type checking account and is weighing pitches from firms including JPMorgan and Capital One Financial Corp. , some of the people said. It is too early to say exactly what the product will look like, including whether it would give customers the ability to write checks, directly pay bills, or access to a nationwide ATM network.  Amazon\u2019s collaborative approach supports what bank executives have long said: that new regulations put in place after the financial crisis, while bad for profitability, are a protective moat against challengers.  Related Video Amazon wants to deliver everything you want to your doorstep, anywhere in the world. But the e-commerce giant faces several challenges in its pursuit of a global empire. WSJ's Karan Deep Singh breaks down the basics with the help of an Amazon delivery box.  Any move by Amazon to start its own banking arm would subject it to capital rules and other regulations that likely would limit its aggressive expansion. And there would likely be stiff opposition. An effort by Walmart Inc. more than a decade ago to obtain a type of banking license withered after intense criticism from a range of companies and lawmakers.  For JPMorgan or Capital One, winning the assignment would be a chance to keep a potential competitor close and strengthen ties to a company that is popular among millennials, whose financial habits are changing quickly. In a recent poll of 1,000 Amazon customers conducted by LendEDU, an online student-loan marketplace, 38% said they would trust Amazon to handle their finances equally as they would a traditional bank.  JPMorgan is already close to Amazon. It has issued Amazon-branded credit cards since 2002, and the two companies are teaming up along with Berkshire Hathaway Inc. on an initiative to tackle rising health-care costs for their employees.  Amazon, led by CEO Jeff Bezos, last fall put out a request for proposals from several banks for a hybrid-type checking account. Photo: Mike Kane/Bloomberg News  JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer James Dimon has said he nearly joined Amazon as an executive in the 1990s. He remains an admirer of the company\u2019s CEO, Jeff Bezos, whom he called a \u201cfriend of the family\u201d at an investor presentation last week.  Capital One, meanwhile, is one of the largest bank users of Amazon\u2019s cloud-computing business.  Amazon has been considering a bigger push into finance for years, looking to reduce the fees it pays banks and payments processors, people familiar with the matter said. Providing Amazon customers with a checking account from which they could directly withdraw cash for purchases could help to reduce some of those fees. But there isn\u2019t much precedent for this type of arrangement. It is much more complicated than, say, a co-branded credit card.  Converting its shoppers into financial account holders could also aid Amazon as it ramps up its efforts in payments, a fragmented segment with no clear winner yet. The company has had limited success in getting its own system, Amazon Pay, accepted at other online merchants.  The company is now trying to bring Amazon Pay to brick-and-mortar stores, according to people familiar with those plans. It is likely to begin with Whole Foods, which Amazon bought last year for roughly $13.5 billion, the people said.  Not yet clear: what Amazon can offer merchants, which already face a number of payment providers jockeying for space at the checkout counter. But shoppers who have an everyday banking relationship with Amazon might be more likely to use Amazon Pay.  Amazon isn\u2019t the first retailer to make a play in financial services. In the early 1980s, Sears Holding Corp. bought brokerage Dean Witter.

Airbnb said in a statement that it selected Mr. Greeley, who will start March 18, due to his operational experience and customer focus. Donna Boyer, director of product for the Homes unit, left the company in January and Airbnb has seen other high profile departures, including its CFO Laurence Tosi, who stepped down last month.  The Homes unit\u2014which includes the apartment and whole-home rentals for which Airbnb is known\u2014represents nearly all of the San Francisco startup\u2019s $2.57 billion in 2017 revenue.  Last month Airbnb announced a series of sweeping changes to Homes, adding options like hotels, a higher-end tier of homes called Plus, and a loyalty program.  The company is grappling with limited inventory in some of its most popular destinations as well as customer complaints of inconsistent home quality. It also has addressed renters\u2019 claims that hosts had discriminated against them. The company implemented changes in late 2016 to ensure hosts couldn\u2019t discriminate.

AMZN -1.22% said it would start delivering Whole Foods groceries via its fastest delivery option in four markets, marking the first major integration between its e-commerce operations and its new brick-and-mortar grocery chain.  The online retail giant will add Whole Foods to its one- and two-hour delivery option, Prime Now, in the grocer\u2019s hometown of Austin, Texas, as well as Dallas, Virginia Beach, Va. and Cincinnati, Ohio.  Stephenie Landry, the Amazon vice president who oversees Prime Now, said it plans to expand the effort, but declined to say how quickly. She noted that Prime Now grew to more than 50 global markets in less than three years following its creation.  Amazon\u2019s latest move is one of the first to potentially take aim at major grocers racing to offer deliveries and pickups to better compete with Amazon, along with rival online delivery services like Instacart Inc., which currently delivers from Whole Foods. Grocer stocks were hit hard by the news of Amazon\u2019s decision to purchase Whole Foods last summer, with six major food retailers losing roughly $12 billion in value after the deal\u2019s announcement.  Still, Amazon has struggled in recent years to make its grocery delivery business work. Its grocery delivery arm AmazonFresh was scaled back late last year, ending service in some ZIP Codes. The company\u2019s acquisition of Whole Foods was viewed by some analysts as a way to help address some of those challenges.  Analysts have largely expected Amazon to start offering Whole Foods deliveries since the roughly $13.5 billion deal was announced. Already Amazon pairs with grocer Sprouts Farmers Market Inc. and other outside retailers and restaurants in some markets to offer speedy deliveries.

Prime Now is available only to the company\u2019s Prime members, who typically pay $99 annually. Two-hour deliveries are free on orders over $35, but tips are suggested for drivers. One-hour delivery costs $7.99.  Amazon has previously lowered prices at Whole Foods and started offering some of the grocer\u2019s private label brands on its website and via Prime Now. It also plans to introduce benefits for members of its Prime program.  Ms. Landry said that Whole Foods and Amazon have been partnering on the Prime Now initiative, allowing Amazon to take advantage of the grocers\u2019 marketing expertise and in-store operations.  \u201cYou\u2019re going to continue to see us doing lots of things together,\u201d she added.  \u2014Heather Haddon contributed to this article  Write to Laura Stevens at laura.stevens@wsj.com", "stock": "AMZN"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-want-to-talk-food-waste-with-amazon-1519914762", "label": 1, "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "date": "2018-03-01", "article": "Shoppers at the Whole Foods Market in Midtown Manhattan.

Amazon in January told the Boston-based mutual fund that food waste wasn\u2019t material and that the e-commerce giant was already working to reduce it. Amazon said food represented less than 1% of operating expenses and assets last year, allowing it to exclude the proposal under SEC rules.  Grocers, restaurants and food-service companies waste food worth $55 billion a year, according to ReFED, a nonprofit working on food-waste reduction. Food retailers are responsible for food waste worth some $18 billion a year, roughly double the sector\u2019s profit from food sales.  More investors are pushing companies to change food-waste and packaging practices that they see as a potential drag on profits in a low-margin business. Many companies are responding. Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc., Walmart Inc. and other food retailers are working with shareholders who have raised such concerns. Costco Wholesale Corp. , Target Corp. and Chipotle Mexican Grill , Inc. have acknowledged similar investor requests.

AMZN -1.22% integrates the pioneering natural grocer into its retail empire.  More than a dozen executives and senior managers have left since Amazon acquired Whole Foods last year, according to former employees and recruiters steering them to new jobs. People who have left include leaders of the bakery, produce, sustainability and local-foods divisions.  Some veterans have left even though higher-ups asked them to stay. Others say they were pushed out after the deal was announced but before it closed, as Whole Foods sought to tighten command.  Executives from Amazon and Whole Foods said that the two companies share a customer focus, are fitting together well and have made great strides in the merger in a short time. But the exodus has raised concerns among employees and suppliers that the distinctive approach that made Whole Foods a natural and organic powerhouse won\u2019t endure under Amazon\u2019s ownership.  \u201cCulturally it\u2019s been a rough start,\u201d said a procurement veteran who left Whole Foods earlier this year after nearly a decade.  Some of the grocer\u2019s top managers have bristled at reporting to younger Amazon executives, people who work with them say. Other employees say Amazon hasn\u2019t explained the specifics of its plans to integrate the grocer into its business.  Amazon wants to deliver everything you want to your doorstep, anywhere in the world. But the e-commerce giant faces several challenges in its pursuit of a global empire. WSJ's Karan Deep Singh breaks down the basics with the help of an Amazon delivery box.  Whole Foods chief executive and co-founder John Mackey and Steve Kessel, an Amazon senior vice president who oversees the grocer, said in separate statements that Whole Foods has thrived in the seven months since the e-commerce giant bought it for roughly $13.5 billion.  \u201cWe...have maintained our distinctive culture while embracing many of Amazon\u2019s leadership principles,\u201d Mr. Mackey said.  \u201cWe are off to a great start, and look forward to many years of future success together,\u201d Mr. Kessel said.  Executive departures are common after mergers. Amazon and Whole Foods have held town halls for store employees to discuss their concerns.  This week, executives invited top suppliers to Whole Foods\u2019 Austin headquarters to discuss their frustration with operational changes, including fee increases that predate the merger. Some suppliers said the additional cost could force them to raise prices or defect to other retailers.  The fee increases are overdue and the changes are providing more consistency for suppliers, a spokeswoman said. Whole Foods leaders at the meeting discussed new merchandising opportunities and growth plans with roughly 200 suppliers, she said.  Some Whole Foods executives are urging their colleagues to be patient. They say Amazon can help the grocer make technology improvements, and new ownership has relieved the company of shareholder pressure to reverse falling sales. Some Whole Foods department managers described Amazon executives as respectful and eager to learn from the grocer\u2019s decades of experience sourcing food and handling produce.  Some Whole Foods employees want Amazon executives to tackle the grocer\u2019s problems more aggressively. Already, Amazon executives have questioned an inventory-management system that has left many Whole Foods stores short of some products, according to a person familiar with the discussions.  But other Whole Foods veterans have been frustrated by what they see as Amazon\u2019s insular culture and penchant for secrecy, according to current and former employees. \u201cThere really hasn\u2019t been very much communication,\u201d one former executive said.  Some cited the two organizations\u2019 fundamental differences on issues such as promoting and grooming talent, and whether to focus more on needs of customers or employees. They have noted pressure to put on a good face for Amazon executives, including among the rank and file during town hall meetings.  Some suppliers said new hires at Whole Foods have been slow to master the chain\u2019s techniques for sourcing and marketing healthful foods. Many executives who have left, meanwhile, are consulting for other natural-food companies and interviewing with other retailers, taking that knowledge to competitors.  \u201cIt makes it really difficult when you lose the institutional knowledge,\u201d said Bill Caskey, co-founder of the food consultancy Pentallect Inc.

Amazon.com Inc. AMZN -1.22% has accounted for 27% of the broader index\u2019s 1.6% gain through Tuesday, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices\u2019 data. That is followed by Microsoft Corp. MSFT -0.53% , which has contributed 13%, and Netflix Inc. at 8.3%. U.S. stocks fell Wednesday, but Amazon and Netflix extended their 2018 gains, adding to their dominance over the S&P 500.  \u201cWhen you see a Netflix or Amazon leading, it\u2019s not necessarily a great sign of investor confidence, since you know those names can always deliver growth no matter what\u2019s going on,\u201d said Jack Ablin, founding partner and chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors.  Investors have fretted in recent years about the dominance of a single sector or stock in the market, but those fears have generally proved unfounded. Markets continued marching higher even after shares of Apple Inc., which was a driver of the rally, stalled for part of 2016.  The S&P 500 technology sector has driven more than three quarters of the index\u2019s gains, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. The next biggest contributor is the consumer-discretionary sector\u2014which includes tech-focused Amazon and Netflix\u2014with more than a third of the advance.  To some investors, the continued outperformance of technology-oriented companies is surprising. After the tech sector jumped 37% in 2017, nearly doubling the broader S&P 500\u2019s advance, many investors expected the rally to stall or be overtaken by other sectors.  Among those expected to gain were cyclical stocks like commodity producers, manufacturers and banks whose businesses tend to improve as the economy strengthens and prices rise.  Instead, energy shares have extended their rout, even as U.S. crude prices have bounced off their 2014 lows. Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. have together chipped away about 12% from the S&P 500\u2019s year-to-date advance. And industrial firms, which soared after the 2016 presidential election on bets that the Trump administration would pump up infrastructure spending, have lagged behind the S&P 500, as some investors have questioned how the administration will secure funding for its plan.  Other investors predicted bank shares would begin outperforming the broader market again after the passage of the Republican tax overhaul. And those companies have seen a boost: JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp. together have made up 12% of the S&P 500\u2019s 2018 gains, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.  Yet enthusiasm for technology stocks hasn\u2019t tapered off. Roughly a third of global fund managers say they are overweight technology stocks in their portfolios, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey conducted at the start of the month. That was the highest share of overweights of all 11 S&P 500 sectors.  Tech\u2019s dominance has helped the Nasdaq Composite, which heavily weights shares of technology companies, outperform other indexes so far this year.

The cashierless convenience store, which had been open only to employees for testing purposes, is scheduled to open to the public on Monday after a yearlong delay. Photo: Elaine Thompson/Associated Press  Nearly a year after it was promised, Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s AMZN -1.22% cashierless convenience store is slated to open to the public on Monday.  The new Amazon Go store, located in the base of Amazon\u2019s main headquarters in Seattle, uses computer vision and machine-learning algorithms to track shoppers and charge them for what they select, thereby eliminating checkout counters.  In an interview last week, Dilip Kumar, vice president of technology for Amazon Go and Amazon Books, said testing with employees has trained the technology to work in the store, an experiment that is part of the company\u2019s broader effort to reinvent how consumers shop.  Mr. Kumar declined to say whether Amazon will expand the Go concept, although he said the company has developed the technology to scale.  From the Archives Amazon unveiled its first small-format grocery store, Amazon Go, on Monday. It\u2019s one of at least three formats of brick-and-mortar food stores the online retail giant is exploring. Photo: Amazon.com Inc. (Originally published Dec. 5, 2016)  Amazon announced the new Go store with fanfare in December 2016, and said it would open to the public in early 2017. The opening was delayed, however, as the technology proved more difficult to master than expected, with glitches occurring when too many people were in the store or were moving too quickly, The Wall Street Journal reported in March 2017.  Amazon didn\u2019t explain the delay at the time. According to Mr. Kumar, while the store was originally expected to quickly open to the public to gain extra traffic needed for testing, the company decided it had enough employees to teach the system instead.  That training helped Amazon Go\u2019s technology better identify objects and follow the different speeds and patterns of shoppers, tasks Mr. Kumar described as particularly challenging in a crowd.  Some people \u201cmove in very unpredictable ways,\u201d Mr. Kumar said. \u201cYou\u2019re always bending down, you\u2019re examining items, you\u2019re picking things up.\u201d  The Go experiment shows how Amazon is trying to transform shopping in physical stores after decades of pioneering retail online. Since 2015, the company also has added more than a dozen Amazon Books stores, which encourage customers to pull out their phones to scan covers for prices.  In August, Amazon completed a $13.5 billion deal to buy grocery chain Whole Foods, adding 470 brick-and-mortar stores to its portfolio overnight.  Amazon Go\u2019s technology uses cameras throughout the store to track shoppers once they are inside, though it doesn\u2019t use facial recognition, Mr. Kumar said. A customer entering the store scans his or her phone and then becomes represented internally as a 3-D object to the system. Cameras also are pointed at the shelves to determine interactions with goods.  Shoppers browse the items at the Amazon Go store in Seattle during its employee-only testing phase. The store uses computer vision and machine-learning algorithms to track shoppers. Photo: Elaine Thompson/Associated Press  Among the challenges for the technology was telling the difference between similar looking products\u2014say containers of vanilla and regular yogurt. Adding to the complexity, when customers pick up products, they usually cover the distinguishing aspects of the label with their hands.  Some store associates are still needed. For example, customers purchasing alcohol must show identification.  Former Amazon executives say it likely would be difficult to scale the system to track people in a bigger store, and that it could take years to make it work in a larger store footprint. Still, they say it may make sense one day for Amazon to try to implement the technology more widely\u2014either via additional Go stores or even in Whole Foods.  Mr. Kumar said there are currently no plans to introduce the technology in Whole Foods. He added, however, that every project should be expandable.  \u201cWe have this unwritten rule that whatever it is you\u2019re building, you have to be able to scale it so that it covers significantly amount of more load than what you would normally ever expect,\u201d Mr. Kumar said.

The partnership will include opening a combined e-commerce fulfillment center in the Tokyo area to deliver groceries to a wider area.  The partnership could boost Wal-Mart \u2019s position in a promising business where Amazon isn\u2019t yet strong. Japanese spent about $19 billion on food deliveries in the year ended March 2017, including orders made in person, over the phone or online, according to Yano Research Institute. That number is growing as more women work and the elderly population rises. Rakuten shares jumped during Tokyo trading Friday when the deal was announced and closed 4.5% higher.  But Wal-Mart faces plenty of other competitors in food delivery, such as stores owned by Seven & I Holdings Co. , the Tokyo-based parent of the 7-Eleven convenience-store chain. Food cooperatives and smaller ventures that target niche markets, such as organic vegetables, are also vying for customers. Wal-Mart and Rakuten said they would offer meal kits, a product already sold by many of their rivals.  In the U.S., Wal-Mart will work with Rakuten\u2019s Canadian unit, Rakuten Kobo, to offer for the first time e-books and audiobooks in the U.S., as the company tries to make walmart.com, a destination for a wider variety of purchases and activities.  The deal \u201cenables us to quickly and efficiently launch a full eBook and audiobook catalog on Walmart.com,\u201d Scott Hilton, chief revenue officer for Wal-Mart \u2019s U.S. e-commerce unit, wrote in a blog post Thursday. The digital books could also be offered in stores.  Amazon, which started as an online bookseller and has grown rapidly into other categories, dominates the U.S. market for e-books and has sold millions of its Kindle e-readers. Kobo sells its own e-reader device, which Wal-Mart will now carry.  Wal-Mart has expanded its U.S. e-commerce sales in recent quarters after rolling out online grocery services and buying a string of online startups, including Jet.com Inc. in 2016, placing the site\u2019s founder Marc Lore at the head of U.S. e-commerce operations.  In Japan, both Rakuten and Wal-Mart are struggling to keep Amazon at bay. In 2016, Japan was the second-largest market outside the U.S. for Amazon, following Germany, with sales of $10.8 billion.  Wal-Mart has moved away from building its own stand-alone e-commerce sites and infrastructure internationally. Two years ago, Wal-Mart sold its Chinese e-commerce business Yihaodian to JD.com Inc. and holds a roughly 10% stake in China\u2019s second-largest e-commerce company after Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.  Wal-Mart and Rakuten declined to disclose the financial terms of the deal. Under pressure from Amazon, Rakuten\u2019s e-commerce profits are stalling despite growing revenue, prompting it to search for new businesses.  Last month, Rakuten said it was applying for spectrum to become Japan\u2019s fourth major cellphone carrier.

AMZN -1.22% is best known for transforming the U.S. retail industry, a feat that President Donald Trump has recently attacked.  But the company has quietly been cultivating a major customer in his own backyard: the federal government.  In the past several years, the Seattle-based company has won much of the business to help the government shift computing services from legacy mainframes onto the cloud, a business where Amazon is the world leader.  This extraordinary transformation has included the provision of cloud services across Washington\u2019s bureaucracy, from the Department of Homeland Security to the Smithsonian Institution. It also has made the U.S. government a top Amazon customer.  The company doesn\u2019t release specifics, but GBH Insights, a research firm, predicts that Amazon\u2019s government business will grow to $2.8 billion in 2018 and $4.6 billion in 2019, up from less than $300 million in 2015. Other company analysts say those projections are optimistic, but not implausible.  An even bigger prize looms: Amazon is seeking a 10-year contract with the Department of Defense that could be worth $10 billion.  In Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on Amazon, suggesting the company doesn\u2019t pay its fair share of taxes and has damaged the Post Office, he hasn\u2019t mentioned Amazon\u2019s federal government business.  \u201cAmazon is just not on an even playing field,\u201d Mr. Trump said on Thursday. \u201cThey have a tremendous lobbying effort, in addition to having the Washington Post... What they have is a very uneven playing field. Look at the sales tax situation.\u201d He added, \u201cwe\u2019re going to take a pretty serious look.\u201d  Analysts say they don\u2019t see a reason to doubt Amazon will continue to rise as a major Washington contractor, though the president\u2019s criticisms have whipsawed its stock price and injected uncertainty into the equation.  \u201cThe overriding question is whether there is risk to Amazon because Trump seems to have it in for the company,\u201d said Tom Forte, an analyst at D.A. Davidson & Co.  Mr. Forte added that it would be hard for the administration to shift the government\u2019s business elsewhere because of the small number of competitors and the scale of Amazon\u2019s cloud network\u2014data-storage centers arrayed around the country and the globe that provide greater computing power and redundancy in case of emergency.  White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Wednesday that Mr. Trump is \u201cnot involved in the process\u201d of awarding the Defense Department contract.  Amazon\u2019s competitors have seized the moment to seek to slow the company\u2019s march into government business. Over dinner with Mr. Trump on Tuesday at the White House, Oracle Corp.\u2019s co-CEO, Safra Catz, complained that the Pentagon\u2019s process gives Amazon an advantage.  Amazon\u2019s growing government business coincides with a rapid rise of its presence in Washington. In 2010, the company employed eight lobbyists and spent $2.1 million lobbying federal officials, according to data compiled by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. Last year, Amazon spent $13 million and employed 95 lobbyists. Only six other companies spent more on lobbying in 2017.  Amazon has also mounted an aggressive effort to hire former government officials and executives from the company\u2019s competitors to help it navigate government procurement rules. In 2010, the company hired Teresa Carlson, who led federal sales at Microsoft Corp. Scott Renda joined the company in 2014 from the Obama administration, where he oversaw efforts to develop cloud computing.  Newsletter Sign-up  Amazon\u2019s most important early win was in 2013 with a contract to house data for intelligence agencies, including the Central Intelligence Agency. Amazon fought off a challenge from International Business Machines Corp. to retain the contract.  The intelligence community\u2019s willingness to entrust its closely held data to Amazon was a vital signal to other government agencies. Amid a general enthusiasm for using cloud computing to improve effectiveness, the CIA imprimatur suggested that Amazon Web Services, the cloud-computing division known as AWS, was a safe choice, these observers said.  Later that year, the Interior Department awarded a $10 billion contract to 10 vendors, half of whom partnered with Amazon.  In 2014, Amazon benefited from another Obama-era computing initiative: 18F, a consultancy made up of former Silicon Valley developers, which guides government agencies on software and computing procurement.  One of 18F\u2019s first projects was cloud.gov, which helps government agencies such as the Federal Election Commission move some data into the cloud. The government chose to run Cloud.gov on AWS\u2019 GovCloud service, making it easier for government agencies to purchase other Amazon services.

Over time, Amazon has built up other security approvals from the government that allow it to store increasingly sensitive categories of data. Amazon is the only cloud company that has received approval for the government\u2019s most sensitive information.  Those security approvals have enabled Amazon to lock in an advantage over the competition, analysts say. In January, for instance, the U.S. Transportation Command, which manages transportation for the Pentagon, said it was prepared to award AWS a contract without a competitive bid. The company was the only \u201cresponsible source\u201d for the business, because it had been approved to handle government classifications up to \u201cSecret,\u201d the command said.  Amazon worked with 2,300 government entities in the U.S. and overseas in 2017, up from roughly 100 in 2011, according to data the company provided at a conference for Wall Street analysts.  Government sales have helped propel AWS to become Amazon\u2019s biggest profit source. Last year, the company\u2019s cloud computing business had $4.3 billion in operating income on $17 billion in sales, compared with operating income of $2.8 billion on sales of $106 billion at its North American retail business. Analysts estimate 10% of that comes from government contracts.  GBH Insights says Amazon is likely to win the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d of $20 billion in federal cloud computing projects in the next five years. The Washington area is one of the finalists for Amazon\u2019s new \u201csecond headquarters.\u201d  The next big break could come with the Pentagon\u2019s planned $10 billion, 10-year move to the cloud. The proposed contract, called JEDI, would require a cloud infrastructure that could handle unclassified material as well as data classified as secret or top secret, defense department documents said.  Amazon\u2019s competitors worry that the Pentagon will award the contract to a single vendor, rather than multiple providers, which they say is preferable because it would provide needed redundancy in case of outages.  Competitors such as Oracle and Microsoft question the security of Amazon\u2019s cloud architecture.

Van Name, of the \u200eDefense Digital Service, which recruits technology experts from the private sector for stints working on projects at the Pentagon, denied that the department is leaning toward Amazon.  \u201cIt\u2019s about the best proposal,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have no favorites.\u201d  The industry pushed back on the department\u2019s sole-source position.  Roger Waldron, president of the Coalition for Government Procurement, which represents defense contractors including Oracle, IBM and Microsoft, said \u201cgoing to a single vendor closes the market to just that vendor for a decade.\u201d  Microsoft and IBM also separately criticized the department\u2019s decision. Microsoft said it was \u201cdisappointed,\u201d while Sam Gordy, general manager of IBM U.S. Federal, called the move \u201cflawed.\u201d Google declined to comment, and Oracle didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.  Scope of Initiative  Underscoring the scope of the initiative, Essye Miller, the Defense Department\u2019s acting chief information officer, said the Pentagon\u2019s information technology covers \u201cover 1,700 data centers and approximately 500 different cloud initiatives across the department.\u201d  Seattle-based Amazon leads the cloud infrastructure market with 44.2 percent, followed by Microsoft\u2019s Azure with 7.1 percent, China\u2019s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. with 3 percent and Google Cloud Platform at 2.3 percent, based on total cloud industry 2016 revenue, according to research firm Gartner Inc.  Amazon already has a cloud contract with the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency dating back to 2013 that\u2019s valued at $600 million. The online retail giant led by Jeff Bezos has the fastest-growing lobbying arm among tech companies and has spoken to the Pentagon about cloud or procurement since at least 2016, according to federal lobbying disclosures.  Oracle\u2019s Stake  Oracle has a particular interest in how the contract is awarded because it has long-term contracts with multiple government agencies that use its flagship database to store information on their own systems. As the agencies look to switch to cloud computing and eye market leader Amazon, these moves threaten Oracle\u2019s traditional revenue sources. Oracle has tried to protect its database business by offering cloud services of its own, but has come late to that market.  Technology companies worried that the Pentagon favors Amazon point to the decision in early February to award a contract of as much as $950 million to REAN Cloud LLC, an Amazon partner, to help migrate its data to the cloud. On Monday, the Pentagon said it was unaware of the award, made by its Silicon Valley-based innovation unit, and reduced the contract to $65 million.  In a statement Wednesday, Sekhar Puli, REAN Cloud\u2019s managing partner, said that \u201cbased on the threat of legal action and protest by the old guard, the only winners in this delay are those large companies that stand to lose money if the DoD proceeds with innovation. In the meantime, the cost of maintaining antiquated government infrastructure has not subsided.\u201d  Oracle formally protested the REAN contract in February, saying the company was opening a door for Amazon Web Services and asserting that Amazon pressures clients to use REAN, according to a person familiar with the filing.  Respective Strengths  The companies competing for the Defense Department contract are expected to put their respective strengths on display as they present bids. While Amazon is the leader in cloud services, Mountain View, California-based Google emphasizes its focus on security and Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft touts its ability to move existing databases onto the cloud in stages, while keeping some tasks and data in-house if the customer wants.  The transition to the cloud could threaten on-site database providers such as Redwood City, California-based Oracle and IBM, based in Armonk, New York, that have long supplied government technology products but were later entrants into the cloud market.  \u201cFor Oracle and IBM, any government contract feels important. They\u2019re entrenched government vendors,\" said Lydia Leong, a cloud analyst at Gartner. \u201cShifts to the cloud and going off of their architecture is not a happy situation for them.\u201d  \u2014 With assistance by Mark Bergen, Dina Bass, Naomi Nix, and Nico Grant", "stock": "MSFT"}, {"url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-28/microsoft-edges-closer-to-quantum-computer-based-on-elusive-particle", "label": -1, "source": "bloomberg", "date": "2018-03-28", "article": "At Microsoft Corp.'s Dutch research facility at the Delft University of Technology, several large cylindrical metal tubes hang from the ceiling.  Each tube - a dilution refrigerator used to cool circuits down to temperatures colder than deep space - costs more than $500,000, and has helped Microsoft's researchers create an elusive subatomic particle that the company hopes will serve as the building block of its effort to create commercially-viable quantum computers.  The scientists say they have clear evidence of the creation of Majorana fermions \u2013 an elementary particle that its own anti-particle \u2013in a tiny wire that is composed of both semiconducting and superconducting materials, according to research published in the journal Nature Wednesday.  A clean room where nanowire circuits are manufactured at Microsoft's research facility. Photographer: Jeremy Kahn/Bloomberg  The unique properties of these fermions means that they could be used to create quantum computers with much lower error rates than the designs being trialed by rival companies, such as International Business Machines Corp. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, that are also racing to bring quantum computers to market. Currently, those other designs produce too many errors in their calculations to be useful for practical applications, such as the ability to create new chemical catalysts or break the most popular forms of encryption.  Microsoft will now attempt to braid these tiny fermions to create qubits \u2013 the fundamental calculating hardware used in quantum computers. Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s chief executive officer, has said that quantum computing is one of three breakthrough technologies \u2013 the others are artificial intelligence and augmented reality \u2013 that will be critical to the future of the company. Microsoft hopes to eventually rent time on quantum computers to businesses through its cloud computing network.  So far, Microsoft\u2019s efforts have trailed some of its competitors. D-Wave Systems Inc. in 2011 became the first company to sell a quantum computer, although its technology can only perform a certain subset of mathematical problems. Google and IBM have machines that are thought to be close to achieving \u201cquantum supremacy\u201d \u2013 the ability to tackle a problem too complex to solve on any standard supercomputer.  Microsoft, in contrast, hasn\u2019t yet managed to create a working qubit.  The company has devoted significant resources to prove that it can use Majorana fermions to build a less error-prone \u2013 and thus potentially more useful \u2013 machine. The existence of particles that would also contain their own anti-particle was postulated by Italian theoretical physicist Ettore Majorana in 1937. But researchers only observed evidence suggesting the unique fermions actually existed in 2012. But, as the Microsoft researchers write in Nature, data from these earlier experiments \u201cwere noisy,\u201d leading skeptics to speculate that they could be caused by other phenomena. In the new paper, the Microsoft scientists offer much clearer data that, the company says, should silence any remaining doubters.  The U.S. tech company has assembled a globe-spanning team of scientists for its quantum effort, working at labs in the U.S., the Netherlands, Denmark and Australia. It has also put one of its most experienced executives, Todd Holmdahl, who previously delivered both the Xbox game console and the HoloLens augmented reality goggles, in charge of the project. Holmdahl said in an interview with Bloomberg in November that Microsoft would have a quantum computer on the market within five years.  At Delft, Leo Kouwenhoven, a physicist who now works as the principal researcher for the company, gave a tour of the lab, which is also shared by academics working on several different approaches to building a quantum computer \u2013 including a rival team that is funded by Intel Corp. Microsoft soon plans to move into an entire wing of a different building as it scales up its quantum computing project.  Next to a few of the fridges are giant metal doughnuts \u2013 150-pound magnets that the Microsoft team is using to try to create the braiding, essential for their qubits to be less-error prone. The magnets, Kouwenhoven admits, are a double-edged sword, as their size and weight also make the experiments more difficult to run. He said Microsoft believes the calculations of its quantum computer \u2013 assuming it actually manages to create one \u2013 will be between 1,000 and 10,000 times more accurate than what existing machines have been able to achieve.  Kouwenhoven said it is his group\u2019s goal to have produced a working qubit using Majorana fermions by the end of this year. On the floor above where the refrigerators are installed, young graduate students sit at computers analyzing colorful graphic displays that show what is happening inside the circuitry deep within the refrigerator. Kouwenhoven stops to ask if one if he has been able to see indications of Majorana fermions braiding as they have ramped up the power of their magnets. \u201cNo,\u201d the student shakes his head. Kouwenhoven shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s harder to get accurate measurements at higher magnetic energies,\u201d he says. \u201cSo far we haven\u2019t seen evidence of this transition to topological phase.\u201d Theory, Kouwenhoven knows, is on his side. But, as Microsoft\u2019s rivals push ahead with commercialization of quantum computers based on different technology, time may not be.", "stock": "MSFT"}, {"url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-02/microsoft-is-officially-not-the-windows-company-anymore", "label": 1, "source": "bloomberg", "date": "2018-04-02", "article": "In 2012, as Microsoft Corp. was preparing a drastically overhauled version of its Windows computer software, the company's chief executive officer articulated his top priority. \"There's nothing more important at Microsoft than Windows,\" Steve Ballmer said at a tech event. In his typical hyper-excited, semi-shouting style, Ballmer capped his presentation with, \"Windows! Windows! Windows!\"  That was then. Windows hasn't been the heart and soul of Microsoft for several years, and Microsoft made it extra official last week. In a corporate reorganization, Windows was effectively downgraded in the Microsoft corporate hierarchy. The person now in charge of Windows occupies a lower rung of the organization than his predecessor did and reports to the senior executive in charge of Microsoft's current top priorities: corporate software, cloud computing and artificial intelligence.  It was a bureaucratic shift but one charged with symbolism. Windows is no longer the sun in Microsoft's solar system around which all other planets spin. Windows is an outlying moon -- an important one, but still just a moon. \"The future of Windows is bright,\" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in an email to employees on Thursday. It seemed like an afterthought.  Windows! Windows! Windows! Microsoft's Windows revenue has remained relatively steady in the last decade, but the software accounts for a shrinking share of total company revenue Source: Gadfly calculations from Microsoft financial disclosures.  Microsoft's corporate reshuffle reflects the company's financial reality. In 2010, the Windows systems for personal computers were the biggest source of revenue for the company, making up about 28 percent of total sales. In Microsoft's most recent fiscal year, Windows was only the third-biggest source of revenue, behind the Office software bundle and a group of technologies for businesses including computer server software, databases and Microsoft's Azure cloud-computing service. Windows' share of total company revenue was just 16 percent after adjusting for Windows sales that the company spreads out over multiple years.  By design, Nadella -- who's been the boss for four years -- has broken sharply from his predecessors, Bill Gates and Ballmer. And nothing signaled that dividing line between Microsoft's past and future more than Nadella's choice to de-emphasize Windows.  The changing focus was clear from his first months on the job. In a 2014 memo to employees that was Nadella's first mission statement as CEO, he peppered 10 mentions of the Windows operating system for PCs into a roughly 3,000 word missive, and not until the 21st paragraph. He used the word \"cloud\" 21 times.  Heart and Soul Windows was the third-biggest source of revenue for Microsoft last year Source: Microsoft  Nadella's first significant product unveiling as CEO was a version of Microsoft Office tailored to iPads. The software had been developed when Ballmer was still in charge, but it sat on a shelf as the company debated whether the Office app for iPads would hurt Windows sales. Fear of harming the Windows franchise won out until Nadella arrived.  Under Nadella, Microsoft has also made Windows less of a software Big Bang. The entire company used to be organized around developing and releasing a significant new edition of Windows every three years or so. Now, Windows is just another piece of software or app that gets updated continually, like Netflix or Apple's iPhone operating system.  There's less a new version of Windows than many slightly new ones that come out regularly. Microsoft also made those regular updates part of the cost of buying a new computer or signing a contract for a fleet of business PCs rather than paying for a new machine or upgrading the operating system when a new version comes out. It's remarkable how smoothly Microsoft managed a fundamental change to how Windows is developed and released to the public.  Even if Microsoft had kept stressing Windows, the technology world was moving away from it. Personal computer sales have been declining since 2012. Adding up smartphone, tablet and PC sales, Windows software powers less than 15 percent of all the computing devices sold in the world each year. And Windows is nonexistent in emerging areas of technology including driverless cars and internet connected devices for the home.  Microsoft's answer has been to stress areas of technology where it is relevant and has opportunities to lead in the future. That goes back to cloud computing, artificial intelligence and corporate software. All the data amassed by autonomous cars has to be saved somewhere, and it requires hefty computing power to analyze it all. Microsoft wants to be in the middle of all that. The company just won't be there with Windows, Windows, Windows.

Apple still collects our data \u2014 and reserves the right to share it \u2014 but the company has a much better track record than newer tech titans.  \"The truth is, we could make a ton of money if we monetized our customer \u2014 if our customer was our product,\" Cook said on Wednesday. \"We've elected not to do that.\" Asked what he'd do if he were in Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's shoes, he replied, \"I wouldn't be in this situation.\"  In reality, Apple collects more information about its customers than Facebook because it offers more products and services. It knows everything from an iPhone's location to its owner's taste in movies and music. It's all in the company's privacy statement, including the frank admission that Apple will share the data with \"strategic partners that work with Apple to provide products and services, or that help Apple market to customers\" and with law enforcement. Apple also lets applications that run on its platform (including Facebook) hoover up data. And it does have a small ad platform that allows targeted advertising.  Apple's closest equivalent in terms of data collection, sharing and \"pass-through\" to app developers is Google, which offers roughly the same array of services (plus search) and also owns mobile and desktop operating systems. The difference is that Apple has imposed some voluntary restrictions on itself: For example, it anonymizes location data (unless you're using the \"Find My iPhone\" feature) and generally employs \"differential privacy\" \u2014 a cryptography-based practice of obtaining usage and preference data without linking it to specific users. Google and Microsoft also use that to some degree, and a co-inventor of differential privacy, Cynthia Dwork, has even worked for Microsoft Research, but Apple was the first to market the technique as an advantage for its customers.  Cook clearly thinks of these self-restrictions as a good way of staving off external regulation. On Wednesday, he scolded Facebook for not being as far-sighted. \"I think the best regulation is no regulation, is self-regulation,\" he said. \"However, I think we're beyond that here.\"  As a user, however, I wouldn't put much trust in any company's ability to regulate itself. Cook has been wary of monetizing Apple's user base, but he won't be CEO forever. And people do change their mind, especially when it comes to picking up money that's there for the taking. Regulation \u2014 such as the EU's General Data Protection regulation, launching in May \u2014 is a more reliable way to ensure a level playing field. That's why Google, Apple and Microsoft all have good, convenient privacy controls which allow the user to turn off various kinds of data collection, erase data that companies already have and opt out of targeted advertising. Facebook, too, promises to put such controls in place soon.  But even external regulation isn't a reliable guarantee of privacy. Most people won't fiddle with the controls because they may not even realize what all the fuss is about. And by default, companies with advertising-based business models will want to collect as much information as they can and anonymize as little of it as they can. Neither Google nor Facebook, for example, will make the same commitment as Microsoft that no ads will be targeted based on your email and chat contents. Nor will they make it as easy as Apple and Microsoft make to shut off ad personalization.  No regulator will take care of that: It's not their goal to kill off the ad-based business model and with it Facebook and Google, and the model won't work without data collection and ad targeting.  The only real guarantee that companies won't go overboard in invading customers' privacy is that they have large revenue streams which make it an unnecessary risk. Apple is reliable in this regard: It's a hardware company that also sells content and software on commission and on a subscription basis. Microsoft, with its cloud, software licensing and subscription businesses, is even less likely to go rogue in data collection because it no longer has a mobile platform to speak of.  That's why Microsoft and Apple aren't suffering much from the Cambridge Analytica-triggered tech sell-off. Microsoft shares are up 4.5 percent since the beginning of the year, Apple shares are down just 1.63 percent. That compares to Google's 4.6 percent drop and Facebook's 13.3 percent dive. I believe the gains made by Twitter and Snap, two companies fully dependent on ads and information-gathering, are a temporary fluke: They aren't as frequently mentioned in connection with data harvesting as Google and Facebook. As heavier regulation of the ad model becomes reality, they will inevitably suffer as much as their ad-based peers.  Monetization through ads was the only relatively easy choice for companies not offering any products or services that people wanted to buy. That revenue stream, however, is not as easy to hold on to as those coming directly from customers. Those of us who remember the fat days of ad-financed media know that better than anyone. The tech firms that fell back on ads will need to offer value to customers, not advertisers, as the best \"legacy\" media companies have learned to do.

Many developed economies have actually seen productivity stagnate or decline.    A survey from Microsoft Corp. is bolstering one theory about this disconnect. In a poll of 20,000 European workers released Monday, Microsoft, which became one of the world\u2019s most profitable companies by marketing office productivity software, acknowledges new digital technology can, in some circumstances, sometimes not lead to any increase in productivity and actually result in less employee engagement with their work.    Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft joins a growing number of prominent Silicon Valley companies and entrepreneurs that are starting to question the social benefits of the technology they once championed. Facebook Inc. warned in December that its social network might, in some cases, cause psychological harm.    Microsoft identifies a number of instances where technology can be a drag on productivity, including: workers who are too distracted by a constant influx of e-mails, Slack messages, Trello notifications, texts, Tweets \u2013 not to mention viral cat videos \u2013 to concentrate for sustained periods; workers who aren\u2019t properly trained to use the new technology effectively; tech that isn\u2019t adequately supported by the business, forcing workers to lose time because \u201cthe computers are down;\u201d and workers who suffer burnout because, with mobile devices and at-home-working, they feel tethered to the job around-the-clock.    Of course, Microsoft isn\u2019t saying that technology dampens productivity in all cases. Instead, it says that tech\u2019s impact depends largely on the culture of the business. Those with a \u201cstrong digital culture\u201d saw productivity gains from technology while those with what Microsoft termed a \u201cweak digital culture\u201d didn\u2019t.    Microsoft defined companies with a strong digital culture as those where employees had proper training in the new technology, access to information, managers who promoted the adoption of new technology, and where executives conveyed to employees a clear sense of how the technology fit into the company\u2019s strategic vision.    In such businesses, about 22 percent of employees reported feeling highly productive and only about 5 percent reported feeling unproductive, compared with just 12 percent reporting they were highly productive and 21 percent feeling unproductive in companies deemed to have a weak digital culture. The study\u2019s authors noted that even 22 percent reporting high productivity \u201csuggests there is still more work that can be done to help every employee do their best work.\u201d    The survey also found digital culture had a big impact on how new technology changed employees\u2019 feelings of engagement with their work. In businesses with a strong digital culture, increased use of technology also boosted employees\u2019 feelings of passion and focus. But, in companies with a weak digital culture, it had the opposite effect: the more technology the company deployed, the less attached workers became.    In an introduction to the study, Michel van der Bel, Microsoft\u2019s president for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said businesses should look at the adoption of new digital technology as \u201ca people journey\u201d and not just \u201can IT exercise.\u201d", "stock": "MSFT"}, {"url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-18/microsoft-says-ai-advances-will-require-new-laws-regulations", "label": 1, "source": "bloomberg", "date": "2018-01-18", "article": "The rapidly advancing area of artificial intelligence will require a new field of law and new regulations governing a growing pool of businesses involved, according to Microsoft Corp., a 25-year participant in AI research.  Companies making and selling AI software will need to be held responsible for potential harm caused by \u201cunreasonable practices\u201d \u2013 if a self-driving car program is set up in an unsafe manner that causes injury or death, for example, Microsoft said. And as AI and automation boost the number of laborers in the gig-economy or on-demand jobs, Microsoft said technology companies need to take responsibility and advocate for protections and benefits for workers, rather than passing the buck by claiming to be ``just the technology platform\u2019\u2019 enabling all this change.  Microsoft broaches these ideas in a 149-page book entitled \u201cThe Future Computed,\u201d which will also be the subject of a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, next week. As Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft seeks to be a leader in AI and automating work tasks, it\u2019s also trying to get out in front of the challenges expected to arise from promising new technologies, such as job losses and everyday citizens who may be hurt or disadvantaged by malfunctioning or biased algorithms.  \u201cWe are trying to be clear-eyed in talking about the challenges,\u201d said Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith, who will sit on the Davos panel and co-wrote the introduction to the book.  Microsoft is working on some of these areas through groups such as the Partnership on AI, which includes rivals like Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, Apple Inc. and Facebook Inc. Still, the call for more regulation in an emerging area like AI is unusual for technology companies, said Ryan Calo, a professor at the University of Washington School of Law, who has read the book.  \u201cThere are a bunch of players in this space, and if you are Microsoft you want to be seen as trusted,\u201d said Calo, who did not assist the company on the book but has consulted for it on other issues and whose lab is partially funded with donations from Microsoft. Whatever the company\u2019s motivations, the area is an important one, Calo said. \u201cAny sufficiently transformative technology is going to require new laws,\u201d he said.  Brad Smith, President, and Harry Shum, EVP, AI & Research Photographer: Microsoft  Both Microsoft and Calo say the development of new legislation isn\u2019t imminent because the specific needs are still emerging. Over the next two years, Microsoft plans to codify the company\u2019s ethics and design rules to govern its AI work, using staff from Smith\u2019s legal group and the AI group run by Executive Vice President Harry Shum. The development of laws will come a few years after that, Smith said.  In the nearer term, Microsoft is advocating for changes to labor laws to properly classify workers and allocate benefits like health care and retirement planning to people with jobs such as an Uber driver or Postmates delivery person. Smith expects there will be a need for a new category of worker to cover these employees, who are neither full-time nor independent contractors, he said.  \u201cThe technology industry needs to engage to change the perception that it reaps the benefits of technology progress at the expense of workers who are displaced or left without protections, benefits or long-term career paths,\u201d the company writes in the book. \u201cCompanies that do not acknowledge the importance of worker protections and benefits risk damage to their brands and face the possibility that lawmakers and the courts will step in to impose regulations.\u201d", "stock": "MSFT"}, {"url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-24/gates-says-america-first-endangers-u-s-influence-in-africa", "label": 1, "source": "bloomberg", "date": "2018-01-24", "article": "Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft Corp. and the second-richest person in the world, said there\u2019s a danger that U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d approach could damage the U.S.\u2019s influence in Africa in the long term.

Apple accounted for 17 percent of mobile computing shipments to American students in kindergarten through high school, according to data from the third quarter published by Futuresource Consulting. Devices running Google\u2019s operating systems on Chromebooks or Android tablets held 60 percent of the market, and Windows PCs had 22 percent. While Macs and iPads make up less than 20 percent of Apple\u2019s sales combined, students and teachers are a key market to drive future purchases.  A new, cheaper MacBook laptop is in the works and likely destined to replace the MacBook Air at a price less than $1,000, but it probably won\u2019t be ready in time for next week, the people said. The MacBook Air, introduced about a decade ago, hasn\u2019t seen a major change since 2010, the same year the iPad came out. Although the laptop is popular with college students, it has languished as Apple focuses on more expensive Macs.  Rival laptops have made inroads into the education market lately, a field that originally helped Apple make its name. The sector is prized among industry giants because students learn to use a certain type of device, then head into the workforce and spread the technology wider.  With a recent advertising onslaught, Apple is hoping to capture more young minds with the iPad. The company has revised its tablet strategy over the years by releasing different versions at a variety of price points. That\u2019s helped the iPad business return to growth after multiple declining quarters. Still, demand for tablets is weak. According to research firm IDC, the market shrank by about 7 percent in 2017. Apple grew 3 percent last year and leads the industry with about a quarter of the market.  Apple's Tablet Roller Coaster iPad growth is returning after sales slowed for several quarters  Apple currently offers a slew of different education-related software. The company\u2019s Classroom app for the iPad lets teachers manage Apple devices that are assigned to students for their classwork. There\u2019s also an iTunes U app that lets teachers issue homework, grade assignments and post lessons online. It also lets students complete assignments and take tests. The company offers a software coding curriculum via the Swift Playgrounds app and sells interactive textbooks through its e-book store.  More software is coming. Apple is working on a new version of the iBooks app that\u2019s more in line with the design of the App Store, though it\u2019s unclear if it\u2019ll be shown next week, people familiar with the project have said.  In an invitation to the Chicago event, Apple said it will introduce \u201ccreative new ideas for teachers and students.\u201d Having a venue where attendees can see the new technology in action inside a classroom would be a sound strategy for a company that focuses its announcements on live demonstrations.  Next week\u2019s event will also provide an opportunity for Apple to boast about the work it\u2019s doing with Chicago schools. In December, the company partnered with the city\u2019s public school system and City Colleges of Chicago on a coding curriculum for thousands of local students. Apple has also discussed additional education-related programs with the city, people familiar with the talks said.  According to Apple\u2019s website, the school where the event will take place is not an \u201cApple Distinguished School,\u201d a designation given to institutions with curriculum that uses Apple products and provides iPads to all students.  Apple has tried citywide iPad deals for students in the past, with little success. In 2013, the Los Angeles Unified School District said it would spend $30 million to provide some students with iPads. The deal was expected to become a $1.3 billion initiative to give every student in the district an iPad, but it fell apart.  Such a deal won\u2019t be announced with Chicago next week, people familiar with the plans said. But the city could see more of Apple in the future. According to a recent Bloomberg analysis, the company could be eyeing the Midwest for a major new office.  \u2014 With assistance by Debby Wu", "stock": "MSFT"}, {"url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-26/tech-takes-on-trump-as-supreme-court-looks-at-data-stored-abroad", "label": -1, "source": "bloomberg", "date": "2018-02-26", "article": "The tech industry takes on the Trump administration at the U.S. Supreme Court Tuesday in a high-stakes clash over digital privacy and government access to information stored on overseas servers.  At issue is whether federal and state law enforcement officials can use a decades-old law to demand user emails and other data held abroad by domestic companies including Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and Microsoft Corp.  The case calls on the justices to decide how a law older than the World Wide Web itself applies in the era of cloud computing. What they say could have sweeping consequences -- that is, unless Congress acts on pending proposals to overhaul the law and set out a more nuanced approach.  \u201cThe court is presented with two pretty stark choices,\u201d said Jennifer Daskal, a professor at American University\u2019s Washington College of Law. There are \u201cproblems with either side winning,\u201d she said.  The case stems from a federal effort to use the 1986 Stored Communications Act to get emails from an unidentified account kept on a Microsoft server in Ireland. The government, which says the emails would show evidence of drug trafficking, got a search warrant in 2013. Microsoft refused to turn over the information, deciding to fight the matter in court instead.  Beyond U.S. Borders  Microsoft says the government is improperly trying to use the 1986 law in a foreign country. The Supreme Court is generally loath to say a federal law applies beyond the U.S. borders.  The government is trying to \u201cunilaterally reach into a foreign land to search for copy and import private customer correspondence physically stored in a digital lockbox on a foreign computer where it\u2019s protected by foreign law,\u201d said Joshua Rosenkranz, the lawyer who\u2019ll will argue the case for Microsoft.  The Trump administration, which inherited the case from President Barack Obama\u2019s legal team, says it\u2019s not trying to apply the U.S. law overseas. Officials served the warrant on Microsoft at its headquarters in Redmond, Washington, and disclosure of the email content would occur domestically as well, U.S. Solicitor General Noel Francisco said in court papers.  The law \u201cfocuses on disclosure, and the disclosure of records from Microsoft to the government would occur in the United States,\u201d Francisco argued.  Microsoft stores email content at more than 100 data centers in more than 40 countries. The company says it uses so many sites for the sake of speed, putting users as close as possible to their data.  Most Frequent Location  At the time of the search, Microsoft\u2019s policy was to store email content in the data center nearest to the customer\u2019s self-declared country of residence. The company has since changed its system so that it relies on the user\u2019s most frequent location.  Other companies store their data differently. Google breaks files into pieces that get stored separately and are constantly being moved from place to place. Google, Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. are among the many tech companies supporting Microsoft.  Business groups say a ruling in favor of the government would prompt users to shun U.S. cloud service providers in favor of foreign-based companies that could offer stronger privacy protections.  Privacy advocates also say such a ruling would invite reciprocity by foreign governments, putting the data of American users at risk from those governments even if it\u2019s held on servers in the U.S.  \u201cIf we say our process works abroad, you can bet that the rest of the world is going to say its process works here,\u201d said Greg Nojeim, senior counsel at the Center for Democracy and Technology in Washington.  \u2018Slow and Uncertain\u2019  The Trump administration says the consequences would be greater if the U.S. were to lose. Although the government would still be able to invoke treaties with some nations to get legal help, the administration says those cover less than half the world\u2019s countries and often mean a \u201cslow and uncertain\u201d process.  States also can use the Stored Communications Act, and 35 of them -- though not tech-heavy California or Microsoft\u2019s home state of Washington -- filed a brief backing the federal government.  \u201cThe business decisions of private corporations should not control whether law enforcement can obtain evidence of crimes committed in their jurisdictions,\u201d the states argued.  The all-or-nothing nature of the Supreme Court dispute is one reason people on both sides are urging Congress to step in, possibly even before the court can rule.  A bipartisan proposal known as the Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act, or Cloud Act, has support from both Microsoft and the Justice Department. It would make clear that U.S. warrants apply around the world, while also setting up a new process for providers to challenge warrants. The law also would put in place new rules for American companies when they receive information requests from foreign governments.  \u201cThe court doesn\u2019t have the tools to figure out the best balance,\u201d said Rosenkranz, the lawyer for Microsoft. \u201cIt\u2019s a policy decision that requires a scalpel, and all the court has is a meat cleaver.\u201d  The case is United States v.

Separately, according to a statement from the office of British Prime Minister Theresa May, President Donald Trump told May on Tuesday that passing the proposals was \"vital\" to the two countries\u2019 security.  The White House said in its own statement that Trump and May would \"advocate for legislation\" around a pending data agreement like the one in the congressional proposals. The White House, however, did not mention a specific bill.  The Cloud Act, according to a statement from its sponsors, would allow the U.S. to make agreements with foreign countries for dealing with law enforcement requests.  The legislation would also make clear that U.S. warrants apply around the world, while allowing technology companies to notify foreign governments of any requests -- as well as a process for challenging them.  \"The new, bipartisan Cloud Act is an important step toward enhancing & protecting privacy while reducing international legal conflicts,\" Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith tweeted on Tuesday.  In October, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a case stemming from a 2013 request by federal authorities for data held overseas by Microsoft and other companies. Microsoft has refused to turn over the information, calling for a legislative solution. It has supported previous legislative proposals on the issue.  The Justice Department supports the legislation, Representative Doug Collins of Georgia said in the sponsors\u2019 statement. The White House and Justice Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday evening.  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is also supporting the proposals, while the Center for Democracy & Technology, a policy institute in Washington, objected that they do not do \"enough to protect the privacy of internet users\" and would \"erode trust in the privacy of data stored in the cloud.\"  In October, Microsoft dropped another lawsuit against the Justice Department over the privacy of customer data after the department moved to scale back the use of orders forcing technology companies to turn over data without alerting users.  \u2014 With assistance by Dina Bass", "stock": "MSFT"}, {"url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-23/choose-your-top-tech-monopolist-fully-charged", "label": 1, "source": "bloomberg", "date": "2018-02-23", "article": "In the 1990's, the U.S. only had one purported monopolist to worry about, Microsoft Corp. Now we have at least three, Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Facebook Inc.  It's almost too many to be angry about at once.  Two notable magazine pieces dug into the power of these tech giants this month. Both articles are worth sitting down with when you have some time. Last week, Wired looked at Facebook's handling of Russian meddling in the U.S. presidential election, capturing growing animosity that seems to be coming at the company from all corners lately.  On Tuesday, the New York Times Magazine published \"The Case Against Google.\" The piece recounts how Google crushed a small search competitor and how the European Commission stepped into the regulatory void to fine Google $2.7 billion. (Google is appealing).  The most compelling part is the depiction of regulators' fight with Microsoft: Even though they failed to punish Microsoft in any meaningful way, the media scrutiny, paired with antitrust monitors, had a significant effect on the company's behavior -- simply because employees got nervous.    \"Microsoft was so powerful, and Google so new, that the young search engine could have been killed off, some insiders at both companies believe,\" the author writes. He quotes Gene Burrus, a former Microsoft lawyer: \u201cThere was a new culture of compliance, and we didn\u2019t want to get in trouble again, so nothing happened.\" The piece questions the myth that Google humbled Microsoft on its own. \"The government\u2019s antitrust lawsuit is one reason that Google was eventually able to break Microsoft\u2019s monopoly.\"  But today Google, despite the historic fine it faces, doesn't seem scared. I suspect the company realizes it isn't enemy number one, at least in the U.S. While regulators might have the most legitimate antitrust case against Google, as demonstrated by the EU decision, rising ill-will toward tech giants and their billionaire leaders isn't focused on the search giant. That scrutiny is falling more on Facebook for reasons that have little to do with antitrust violations.  Politicians and others are hammering Facebook for fake content and a broader lack of authenticity. But it's important to note that the company is part of a growing digital advertising duopoly with Google in the U.S. If attention is the new economy online, they dominate our time spent. If it's data about our lives, they have the most of that, too.  And we haven't event talked about Amazon yet. Cities are prostrating themselves at the company's feet, trying to secure its second headquarters. Amazon can do no wrong in consumers' eyes. But if you talk to bankers or business people, Amazon is the one that strikes the most fear in their hearts. It controls more than two-thirds of the U.S. e-book market now. Amazon alone has the stock market's support to enter new industries, drive margins to zero and destroy rivals in search of more scale. It's great for shoppers and terrifying if you're in the grocery or pharmaceutical business.  So if you're a politician looking to quell public concern, or a regulator trying to even the online playing field, what do you do? Do you go after Facebook, the most-derided in the group of late? Do you go after Amazon, whose growth is so staggering that it is responsible for 27 percent of the S&P 500's gains so far this year? Or do you go after Google, a company that makes it easier to figure out where to get the best burrito -- even if that information used to be scraped without permission from reviews at rival Yelp? Or do you make some noise, then end up doing nothing?  This article also ran in Bloomberg Technology\u2019s Fully Charged newsletter.

During an hour-long argument, the justices struggled to decide how a law older than the World Wide Web affects law enforcement in the era of cloud computing.  Chief Justice John Roberts suggested Microsoft\u2019s argument would put out of the government\u2019s reach an email sent from the Supreme Court building to someone just a block away, if the company had chosen to store it on a server outside the U.S.  Nothing would keep Microsoft \"from storing United States communications, every one of them, either in Canada or Mexico or anywhere else, and then telling their customers: Don\u2019t worry if the government wants to get access to your communications; they won\u2019t be able to,\" without getting help from a from foreign government, Roberts told Microsoft lawyer Joshua Rosenkranz.  Justice Samuel Alito expressed concern that law enforcement would be hobbled without the ability to demand offshore emails from companies located in the U.S.  He asked what happens when a U.S. citizen is being investigated for crimes in this country, and the government has shown it has an \"urgent need\" for \"evidence of this crime in emails that are in the possession of an American internet service provider\" that has stored the emails overseas.  Rosenkranz said U.S. prosecutors would ask for help from that country\u2019s government. \"If it\u2019s urgent for the government, the other governments respond urgently,\" he said.  Microsoft, which is supported in the case by companies including Google, Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., stores email content at more than 100 data centers in more than 40 countries. The company says it uses that many sites for the sake of speed, putting users as close as possible to their data.  Proposal in Congress  The government says that requesting assistance from other countries in gathering evidence can be a slow and difficult process. Fewer than half of the world\u2019s countries have treaties with the U.S. for providing such help.  Several of the Democratic-nominated justices expressed frustration with applying the the decades-old law to the era of cloud computing, suggesting they might prefer to wait for Congress to act on a pending bipartisan proposal to update the law.  Justice Sonia Sotomayor suggested to Deputy U.S. Solicitor General Michael Dreeben that the government\u2019s interpretation of the law would raise conflicts with the data privacy laws of other countries.  \"Why shouldn\u2019t we leave the status quo as it is and let Congress pass a bill in this new age that addresses the potential problems that your reading would create?\" Sotomayor asked, following up on a similar question from Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.  \u2018Break the Cloud\u2019  Rosenkranz, the Microsoft lawyer, told the justices that a ruling could damage the standing of the U.S. as the world leader in the multibillion-dollar cloud computing business.  \"If you try to tinker with this without the tools that -- that only Congress has, you are as likely to break the cloud as you are to fix it,\" he said.  Attending Tuesday\u2019s argument was Republican Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, a cosponsor of the bipartisan measure, which would let the U.S. make formal agreements with other countries for cross-border requests for digital evidence. After the argument, Hatch said in a statement, \"It\u2019s no surprise that throughout this morning\u2019s oral argument, justices continually referred to the importance of action from Congress.\"  The case is United States v.

A timing quirk in the tax overhaul seemed to give companies such as Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Cisco Systems Inc. -- all of which began their fiscal years before Jan. 1 -- the chance to reduce the foreign cash they\u2019ll accumulate this year and lower their taxes. A press release issued by the IRS on Monday indicates that \u201cif done in the ordinary course of business,\u201d the move won\u2019t be considered as tax avoidance, according to Stephen Shay, a tax and business law professor at Harvard Law School.  \u201cThe light is green for this planning, not red,\u201d said Shay, a former top Treasury official. \u201cIt is great for those whose years beginning before 2018 are still open for the planning.\u201d  While companies taking steps to shift their assets would still owe repatriation taxes, they wouldn\u2019t have as much cash taxed at the higher rate -- \"a major concession\" by the IRS, said independent tax and accounting expert Robert Willens.  The tax law signed by President Donald Trump in December overhauled the international tax system and requires companies to pay a mandatory two-tiered levy on their accumulated foreign income. Cash is taxed at 15.5 percent, while less liquid assets face a rate of 8 percent. Companies have been trying to figure out ways to reduce assets subject to the higher rate.  Another provision in the IRS release also allows multinationals some leeway when calculating their repatriation tax bills. The law appeared to make more foreign entities owned by multinationals subject to the repatriation tax, but the agency said Monday that taxpayers that own less than 5 percent of a foreign entity\u2019s capital or profits won\u2019t be hit by the repatriation tax.  \u2018Pro-Taxpayer\u2019 Notice  Banks and financial institutions will also see a reprieve following the IRS\u2019s guidance that a company\u2019s accounts receivable and accounts payable that are longer than one year will be exempt from the repatriation tax, said John Warner, a tax partner at Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney PC. The financial firms had feared the payments under the loans they issue would have faced the 15.5 percent rate, since they\u2019re generally considered accounts receivable, regardless of their maturities.  \"This is generally pro-taxpayer,\" Warner said.  Still, the agency said it would crack down on some strategies multinationals may use to reduce their offshore tax bills, such as artificially reducing their earnings and profits, cash piles or \"pro-rata\" share of transactions, for foreign entities they have stakes in, own or control.  Those rules will be a big deal to some companies, said Michael Mundaca, the co-director of Ernst & Young\u2019s Washington National tax practice and a former top Treasury Department tax official.

In an email to employees publicly released late on Thursday, Microsoft Chief People Officer Kathleen Hogan said Microsoft had 83 harassment complaints in 2017 out of a U.S.-based workforce of over 65,000 employees.  Nearly 50 percent were found to be supported at least in part following an investigation, she said, and more than half of those resulted in the termination of an employee who engaged in unacceptable behavior.  The unusual publication of such data comes as the world's largest software company is defending a lawsuit which alleges it systematically denied pay raises or promotions to women. Microsoft denies it has ever had such a policy.  The lawsuit, filed in Seattle federal court in 2015, is attracting wider attention after a series of powerful men have left or been fired from their jobs in entertainment, the media and politics for sexual misconduct.  Microsoft also investigated 84 complaints of gender discrimination last year, Hogan said, and found around 10 percent of those to be supported at least in part.  Earlier this week, Reuters reported on the contents of unsealed court documents which showed that out of 118 gender discrimination complaints filed by women in U.S.-based technical jobs at Microsoft between 2010 and 2016, only one was deemed \"founded\" by the company.  Attorneys for the women described the number of complaints as \"shocking\" in the court filings, and said the response by Microsoft's investigations team was \"lackluster.\"  Hogan's email on Thursday linked to the Reuters story and said the numbers cited by plaintiffs were misleading.  \"Reports that we rarely reach a conclusion in favor of the complainant are based on a faulty reading of a partial data set,\" Hogan wrote.  Hogan's email did not provide additional figures about the time period cited in the court documents.  The plaintiffs based their numbers on documents disclosed by Microsoft during pre-trial discovery in the lawsuit. Kelly Dermody, an attorney for the plaintiffs, declined to comment on Hogan's email.  Alaina Percival, chief executive of Women Who Code, an organization that helps companies increase their number of women developers, said publicly releasing this kind of data can help businesses learn from each other about the best ways to handle sexual harassment and gender discrimination.  \"I think other tech companies should follow suit, and I would expect to see that happen,\" Percival said.

With that, I made the decision that I wanted to anoint a leader of our Microsoft Studios organization, which if you've tracked it, I've had the leaders of our individual franchises reporting to me for the last three and a half years,\" Spencer told VentureBeat.  \"That's been great in driving our all-up strategy and getting us to the point where Satya was willing and eager to make the investment in gaming that he's made, but it's also become very clear to me that we're going to invest more in content, which we are doing, and that a unified studios leadership organization was going to be critical to our long-term success.\"", "stock": "MSFT"}, {"url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/r-microsoft-women-filed-238-discrimination-and-harassment-complaints-court-documents-2018-3", "label": -1, "source": "business-insider", "date": "2018-03-13", "article": "FILE PHOTO: The Microsoft logo on the Microsoft Theatre in Los Angeles Thomson Reuters By Dan Levine  SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Women at Microsoft Corp working in U.S.-based technical jobs filed 238 internal complaints about gender discrimination or sexual harassment between 2010 and 2016, according to court filings made public on Monday.  The figure was cited by plaintiffs suing Microsoft for systematically denying pay raises or promotions to women at the world's largest software company. Microsoft denies it had any such policy.  The lawsuit, filed in Seattle federal court in 2015, is attracting wider attention after a series of powerful men have left or been fired from their jobs in entertainment, the media and politics for sexual misconduct.  Plaintiffs' attorneys are pushing to proceed as a class action lawsuit, which could cover more than 8,000 women. More details about Microsoft's human resources practices were made public on Monday in legal filings submitted as part of that process.  The two sides are exchanging documents ahead of trial, which has not been scheduled.  Out of 118 gender discrimination complaints filed by women at Microsoft, only one was deemed \"founded\" by the company, according to details in the unsealed court filings.  Attorneys for the women called the number of complaints \"shocking\" in the court filings and the response by Microsoft's investigations team \"lackluster.\"  Companies generally keep information about internal discrimination complaints private, so it is unclear how the number of complaints at Microsoft compares to competitors.  Microsoft said in court filings that the plaintiffs did not identify practices that impact enough employees to warrant a class action, and that it spends more than $55 million per year to promote diversity and inclusion. The company had about 74,000 U.S. employees at the end of last year.  Microsoft said the plaintiffs cannot cite one example of a pay or promotion problem in which Microsoft's investigations team should have found a violation of company policy, but did not. A Microsoft spokesperson could not immediately be reached for comment.  U.S. District Judge James Robart has not yet ruled on the plaintiffs' request for class action status.  A Reuters review of federal court cases filed between 2006 and 2016 revealed hundreds containing sexual harassment allegations where companies used common civil litigation tactics to keep potentially damning information under wraps.  Microsoft had argued that the number of womens' human resources complaints should be kept secret because publicizing the outcomes could deter employees from reporting future abuses.  A court-appointed official found that scenario \"far too remote a competitive or business harm\" to justify keeping the information sealed.

On Monday, a court issued a temporary restraining order which prevents McIntyre from working at Microsoft until further notice.  Using Microsoft's own arguments from a previous lawsuit, IBM is arguing that its diversity strategy is both confidential and \"potentially damaging\" if shared with its competitors.  Tech companies have a less than stellar record hiring women and minorities. But these companies will apparently do whatever it takes \u2014 including launching a legal fight \u2014 to hire one type of person: a Chief Diversity Officer.  IBM is suing its former top diversity officer Lindsay-Rae McIntyre after she got poached by Microsoft, in a case that could prove just how important diversity, recruitment, and retention has become for tech companies.  McIntyre, who joined IBM in 2006, was named chief diversity officer of Microsoft on Sunday, after serving in the same role and as VP of human resources at IBM. IBM, in its complaint, argues that McIntyree had access to diversity data, strategies, methodologies and initiatives that are confidential, and that she \"will use, rely on or divulge\" these strategies in her new role.  On Monday, IBM was granted a temporary restraining order in New York federal court, which prevents McIntyre from working for Microsoft until the court decides otherwise.  \"McIntyre was at the center of highly confidential and competitively sensitive information that has fueled IBM's success in these areas,\" a representative for IBM said in a statement. \"While we understand Microsoft's need to deal with mounting criticism of its record on diversity, IBM intends to fully enforce Ms. McIntyre's non-compete agreement to protect our competitive information.\"  IBM is using another Microsoft lawsuit to argue its case  At the heart of IBM's complaint is an on-going lawsuit from 2015, Moussouris v. Microsoft Corporation. The lawsuit alleges that Microsoft systematically discriminated against women in technical and engineering roles at the company when it came to evaluations, pay, and promotions.  The briefings for that lawsuit wrapped up on February 9. Now it is up to the courts to decide whether or not the case has class-action status.  As part of its non-compete case, IBM is looking to use Microsoft's own legal arguments from the Moussouris lawsuit to make its own point.  In April 2017, to prevent certain information from being released publicly in the discovery process, Microsoft argued that such diversity data is \"not merely confidential, but so sensitive and potentially damaging to Microsoft if revealed to its competitors (e.g., IBM), that the court should take the extraordinary measure of putting the information under seal,\" according to IBM's complaint.  Microsoft ultimately got some of the documents in the case sealed, and others released with redactions.  In its official response to IBM, Microsoft argued that enforcing McIntyre's non-compete agreement is \"draconian,\" as McIntyre has promised not to share confidential information with Microsoft.  It's worth noting that IBM's employee ranks are not a paragon of diversity: According to IBM's website, women comprised 31.8% of its global workforce in 2016.", "stock": "MSFT"}, {"url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/peggy-johnson-microsoft-linkedin-interview-2018-2", "label": -1, "source": "business-insider", "date": "2018-02-02", "article": ".  Peggy Johnson is the executive vice president for business development at Microsoft. Business Insider/Michael Seto  Peggy Johnson is the executive vice president for business development at Microsoft.  Before Microsoft, she spent 25 years at Qualcomm, on the technical side as an engineer and on the business side.  As \"deal-maker-in-chief,\" Peggy Johnson gets paid millions to help make Microsoft billions.  Her actual title is executive vice president for business development, and she's helped lead over 40 investments with Microsoft Ventures. One deal was the acquisition of LinkedIn \u2014 for $26 billion.  \"It takes an army for sure,\" Johnson said on Business Insider's podcast, \"Success! How I Did It,\" about making those investments. \"Clearly, one of that size needs to be assessed fully, and we have fantastic teams across the company who are so good at that assessment.\"  She joined the company three years ago after spending 25 years at the telecommunications company Qualcomm. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella personally called her on a Saturday to get her on board.  Business Insider US Editor-in-Chief Alyson Shontell recently caught up with Johnson at the World Economic Forum, in Davos, Switzerland. On this episode of \"Success, How I Did It,\" Johnson talks about making it to Microsoft and how her team decides which companies to invest in or acquire.

Microsoft's Peggy Johnson, right, spoke with Business Insider US Editor-in-Chief Alyson Shontell at the World Economic Forum, in Davos, Switzerland, in January 2018. Business Insider  To understand Peggy Johnson and the qualities that have made her successful, you have to know about her family. She was the 14th of 15 kids. As a child she was a quiet listener who learned to read her siblings' facial expressions from the kitchen countertop (with so many people, her chair wouldn't fit around the family table). Eventually Johnson followed some of her brothers and sisters to San Diego State University, where she started studying business, even though she really loved math and science. It was there that a chance encounter changed her life's trajectory.  Peggy Johnson: My parents had two rules: You had to go to college, and you had to pay for it yourself. So we all did. I was delivering mail and happened to deliver mail to the engineering department one day. Two ladies at the end of this long hallway with linoleum floors could hear me coming, and they were super excited to see me \u2014 like more excited than they should've been just because I was delivering mail.  It was because they thought I was there to ask about engineering. And they were disappointed. They said, \"We thought you wanted to know something about the School of Engineering.\" I said, \"Nope \u2014 just delivering the mail.\" They said, \"Well, do you know anything about engineering?,\" and I said, \"You know, absolutely nothing.\"  No one had ever really talked to me about engineering, and so they asked me the same question, \"Do you like math and science?\" I said, \"I love it.\" They just started to work on me, and after 15 to 20 minutes I felt, like, \"You know, this might be something I want to do.\"  The next day I changed my major to engineering \u2014 yeah, to electrical engineering.  Alyson Shontell: Wow.  Johnson: I credit those two ladies. They just, you know, worked on me and changed my mind.  Shontell: They changed your life.  Johnson: My life. The whole trajectory of my life really changed in that conversation.  Shontell: So you wound up getting a job at GE after this great electrical-engineering major. And you spent a couple years there.  Johnson: Yeah, I started as an intern while I was still at school, and again, San Diego State put me on a great course because they had a number of great internship opportunities, and this area of General Electric was in their military electronics division. I worked on anti-submarine warfare for surface ships. So it sounds very interesting, I'm sure. You want to know more about that, but I can't say anything because I had a clearance.  But it was a job I might still be in today if not for it seemed like it was going to move to Syracuse, New York, and of course I was in San Diego, California, but I didn't want to move, and well, \"I've got to look for a job here in San Diego,\" and ended up saying no to GE.  Johnson spent 25 years working her way up the ladder  Johnson worked at Qualcomm for 25 years on both the technical engineering side and the business side. Thomson Reuters  Shontell: Is that when you went to Qualcomm?  Johnson: Yes, and I just answered an ad in the newspaper, which they don't do anymore. You probably never even heard of that, but yes, that's how you used to get jobs, look through the newspaper.  Shontell: In the classifieds.  Johnson: The classifieds, and there it was. It was this new company, and they were hiring, and my husband had had an internship at the predecessor to Qualcomm, called Linkabit. He said, \"You know, Irwin Jacobs is an amazing man.\" He had owned and been in Linkabit, and he said, \"I don't know what Qualcomm does, but I think you should \u2014 \"  Shontell: He's the founder of Qualcomm?  Johnson: Irwin Jacobs is, yeah. And so prodded by my husband, who was at that time pursuing his master's degree, and we were married, and one of us needed to work, and that was me. So I went in, had an interview. Hardest interview of my life, and ended up getting the job, and stayed there for 25 years.  Shontell: Yeah, it's incredible. But while you had a long career there, at first it seemed as if you were soft-spoken and it was hard to kind of get your point across in a loud room with those guys.  Johnson: It was.  And I'm soft-spoken probably going back to the family experience. Number 14 out of 15 wasn't an enviable position to be in. You were just one of so many voices at the table, and I was one who had to sit at the side table. So I was at the kids' table until I was, like, 24 years old.  So I was more of a listener, and I was quiet largely because I couldn't ever really break in to that chaos at the big table. But I was a listener and I would watch people, and I would try to understand their mood. Those skills were what I brought into my job at Qualcomm, and maybe not great skills, because when I got to Qualcomm the expectation really at that time was, \"You need to speak up more. You need to be more assertive in meetings. We want to hear from you more.\" Whenever I did that, whenever I tried to be what I wasn't, it didn't really turn out very well, and I didn't feel very authentic, and in fact people would kind of look at me \u2014 \"Why is she being so assertive and aggressive here? That's not like her.\" And it wasn't. It wasn't my authentic self.  So pretty much I had decided, \"I think I have to leave the industry, the company. I'm just not suited for this.\" My manager at the time said, \"No, we are going to figure this out. You're going to stay right where you are,\" and really I credit him for making a lot of changes in the HR department at the time because we were ranked by certain attributes that I didn't have. So I remember being marked off for not being aggressive and assertive in meetings, and he said, \"We are going to change this, and we are going to make sure we have a broader set of qualities that we're looking for.\" Things like teamwork and being collaborative, and he really pushed. It was early, early days, and things changed from that point on. Once I was able to be my more authentic self I felt like that's when my career really took off. I was just my own voice.  Shontell: Yes, so he sort of gave you permission to be yourself and helped you find your own leadership style.  Johnson: He did, yes. I always credit him for that because I might have just left like, I think, a lot of women did at the time. They just didn't feel comfortable and it didn't feel like a very inclusive environment, and he helped change that.  Shontell: So you go on to stay for many, many more years at Qualcomm \u2014 25 years.  Johnson: Yes.  Shontell: What made you so dedicated to that one company?  Johnson: Right, yes. So first of all, Qualcomm's a great company, and they gave me the opportunity to really thrive in a number of roles. So I was an engineer to start with, and I was in the engineering department for several years. Then I had been going out on business trips because we needed to explain the product to the industry we were selling into, and on one of the flights home the general manager happens to be sitting next to me and he said, \"I don't understand. Why don't you just come over to the business side? You really seem to love doing that, and I like the way you translate the technical world into the business world. I think you could be well suited for that.\"  And I thought, \"Well, thank you very much but no, thank you. I'm an engineer.\" I identified with being an engineer, and I remember thinking engineering at that time at Qualcomm was in one building, and all the business people were in the other building, and we made fun of them all the time because they dressed up, and we got to wear our Qualcomm shirts and jeans. We thought we didn't want to have anything to do with that world, but it started to weigh on me, and probably four or five weeks went by, and I remember sitting at our holiday party, and all of sudden I had one of those aha moments, and it was:\" \"You need to do this. You need to make that leap.\" Because while I liked what I did, I loved being in front of the customer. So I did, and I moved over into program management, which is sort of a technical and business role, and that was really the start of my business career at Qualcomm.  Shontell: So you switched from engineering to the business-development side, and that's when things really took off.  Johnson: Yeah, and I think part of it was the time. It was early days of the mobile phones. We were making the digital standard that was eventually embedded into mobile phones in the US, and so everything was exciting and new. We were forging new paths, and it was such a great time to be at the start of a business. None of us had any idea what it would turn into. I don't think any of us at that time envisioned that everybody would be carrying cellphones. I mean, we thought, \"That'll be a good business. Maybe a few million of those will sell.\" So it was fun to be there at the start of that, but I had great managers along the way, and any time I wanted to do something different they really supported me.  Shontell: And switching careers isn't easy. I mean, it's a big risk.  Johnson: Exactly. It is, and you're not quite sure, and if it doesn't work out, can I go back? Once I switched over I had to learn a lot. Clearly I didn't have a business degree, and a lot of it was on-the-job learning, but I had some great mentors and folks who leaned in and helped me. And I just loved every hat I wore after that point, until I moved on to Microsoft from Qualcomm.  How Johnson decided to make the leap and start a new career at Microsoft  Johnson was recruited by Satya Nadella as his first big hire after becoming Microsoft's CEO in 2014. Microsoft  Shontell: It sounds like you had a great setup. You established yourself through the ranks, had great mentorship. So Microsoft calls. You'd been rejecting other calls before, kind of just hanging up the phone on recruiters. What was it about Microsoft?  Johnson: Well, I wouldn't call them back. I wouldn't hang up on them.  Shontell: OK: You were polite about it.  Johnson: That's it. But it was one of those interesting times. I hadn't ever called any back because everything was great at Qualcomm. I loved it, and also I was living in San Diego, my family was there. Everything was fantastic, but at the time of the industry Satya had just taken over, Satya Nadella, as CEO of Microsoft. We did business with Microsoft. We sold them chips, and so we know, of course, of Microsoft. We didn't really know Satya, and one of the first things he did is he decided to put Office on IOS and Android phones, and that blew us away. I mean, probably not just us in Qualcomm, but the industry.  That was quite a bold move, and so when I got the call from Microsoft they said, \"Well, it's a job reporting to Satya. You'd be running business development.\" I thought, \"I just want to call back to understand what it's about. The company seems to be in this big transition, and I just want to learn a little bit basically.\" But of course was never going to go anywhere. I lived in San Diego there wasn't any question that I was going anywhere. When I called back I was just drawn in, and eventually I had a conversation with Satya.  Shontell: He called you on a Saturday.  Johnson: He did, yeah. He did, and so I was chatting with him, and again it was kind of like another aha moment. He was talking about his world view of a mobile-first, cloud-first world, and all of a sudden it just connected with me because obviously I'd been living in a mobile-first world, a wireless world. That was what I knew inside and out. I felt very comfortable in that world. Then when data left the phone it went off to that thing called the cloud and Qualcomm didn't have much to do with that. As he was talking about this idea of ambient computing and having intelligence everywhere it just clicked with me that this is something I need to know more about, and I wanted to understand more about Satya's vision, and eventually took a trip to Seattle.  I remember getting on the plane in San Diego feeling like, \"I hope nobody sees me because I've never done this before. I'm gonna go visit another company for a job possibly.\" And had a chance to meet the rest of the management team, and then to sit down with Satya. His vision to empower every person and organization on the planet, to achieve more, it just struck me, and it resonated with me, and I ended up saying yes, making the move with my family. We had only one child at home at that time, and so we moved up to Seattle, where I live today.  Shontell: He's done incredible things with Microsoft.  Johnson: He has, absolutely.  Shontell: What's he like to work with?  Johnson: Very empathetic. He's a listener. He's a learner. Curious. We're allowed to fail, learn from it, but it's super important. He's really changed the company at its core, and we are following a growth mindset, which he introduced to the company, and I feel like whenever we sort of get off path a little bit, we come back to the growth mindset. We'll say, \"Are we exhibiting a growth mindset here?\" You know? It's easy to say no. Any idea you can have 10 nos. It's a lot harder to say yes. So the growth mindset allows us to push boarders a little bit, and to say yes more, try things out, fail fast. I believe it's changed the core of the company, and I hear that from others outside, which is very gratifying. But what's so exciting is that the campus is energized, and it's just been a wild, crazy, fun ride for the last three years.  What it takes to be Microsoft's deal-maker-in-chief  As executive vice president for business development, Johnson has overseen more than 40 investments, including the $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn. REUTERS/Robert Galbraith  Shontell: So it's been three years. You've done a lot. One thing that stands out: You worked with a big team on the LinkedIn deal. Microsoft bought LinkedIn for $26 billion-plus.  Johnson: Yeah: $26 billion.  Shontell: So how does a $26 billion deal happen? How long did it take? What happens behind the scenes? Because most of us don't get to that level.  Johnson: It takes an army, for sure. I mean, I would say the evolution of an acquisition that big has to go through many, many gates, and it starts with sort of conversations. It starts with a strategy. \"Are we the better owners?\" Looking at it from all different angles.  Clearly, one of that size needs to be assessed fully, and we have fantastic teams across the company who are so good at that assessment. Also, the engagement, once we decided to make the decision to go forward, the engagement with the company, the integration part, which is super important. You can make all of the great strategic assessments ahead of time, but if you can't integrate well after, you've lost a lot of money. The teams at Microsoft are just first class at that.  Shontell: So is it a 10-month process? Faster?  Johnson: I can't remember. There were conversations for a long period of time, but then once we sort of pulled the trigger, I want to say \u2014 I don't know \u2014 maybe it was somewhere between six and 12 months. I can't quite remember from the time of the first conversations until we announced that we were going to proceed with an acquisition.  Shontell: When I saw the headline, and we were writing it on Business Insider, it was like, \"Oh, whoa. This is a huge deal.\" It went totally under the radar. You didn't get scooped.  Johnson: Another thing that I think we did a very good job on ... because obviously a team that size inside the company did a very good job of keeping things quiet on both sides. Including the transactional folks in between. So all of that had rolled out very, very well. It was sort of the example of how you'd like to do an acquisition.  Shontell: I'm sure you say no, of course, much more than you say yes. One that stands out is Slack, I think, was an opportunity to buy, and I think Microsoft ultimately passed, along with some others. On a deal like that, how do you weigh it?  Johnson: Well, without commenting specifically on Slack, I would say for any acquisition we ask that question, \"Are we the better owners? Does it fulfill a strategic gap that we have?\" Because many times a partnership is even better oftentimes because to be an owner you have to be all in, but if a partnership can work to fill a gap, we'll go that route. Sometimes we'll make an investment in a company because they're on a quicker path to filling a gap, but they may need a little help in the form of resources to get there. Then finally if the right answer is, \"Yes, we are the better owners,\" we'll go the full way and go forward with an acquisition.  So we do sort of an assessment that way, and we try to be very, very disciplined, and stick to our core ambitions, and not go too far off of that, because that's where you get into trouble. So we talk ourselves in and out of things often.  Johnson explains how to be a good leader  Johnson learned a lot of leadership skills growing up in a family with 15 children. Microsoft  Shontell: You've said that prioritization is a skill that you learned really early on. Do you have tips? How do you figure out, in a job as huge as yours \u2014 I'm sure you have a million different things that you could be doing \u2014 how do you focus, and how do you zero in on the right things?  Johnson: Well, I think I learned it from my mom, who is probably the program-manager-in-chief to run a house like that. Because one of the things she used to say is, \"We may have 15 kids, but we're not gonna be a messy house. When people come in the house we don't want them to say, 'Oh yeah, this is what I thought a house with 15 kids would look like.'\" So she was very disciplined. She made lists \u2014 and I love lists \u2014 and checking things off the list always feels good.  So I learned sort of that prioritization from my mom, and that it's not important to get everything on the list done but really to make sure that you set out in the morning to get the top ones done. That's what your focus should be. You shouldn't be stressed that you didn't get to the bottom of the list. She was very good at that.  Shontell: Another skill of yours is you're great, from what I've heard your coworkers say, you're great at building these relationships that last a long time. Especially in that business \u2014 it's so critical to have that. How do you do that? What are your tips for building long-lasting work and general life relationships?  Johnson: I think it goes back to that family table when I was the listener in the room, and that is something that is probably a little bit underrated, but for me has been, I feel like, the core of my leadership abilities is the ability to listen, and to deeply listen, and to understand and put myself in the other person's shoes. Once you do that you can solve whatever problem there is on the table whether it's a business problem or a technical problem, I think, more quickly having that ability to put yourself on the other side.  Shontell: Then I have a kind of more general landscape question. I think someone asked you once what you thought the biggest issue women face in the workforce is, and you said harassment. Certainly we've seen a lot of stories about that this year, Harvey Weinstein on up. What do you think we can do better? How do you think we can fix it? What have you seen that makes you say that?  Johnson: Well, I just feel like you should be able to have a respectful work environment, because if you do you'll be your best self. You'll bring your best self to work, and over the years there was always that whispering at work when there was people you avoided because you didn't want a comment about your dress or something, and I think about all of the cycles that my friends and I would share, you know, \"Don't go by that person's office. Go the long way around.\" Those cycles could have been put to a lot better use. So there's kind of a business reason to stop this, and there's obviously all of the other reasons that we've been talking about since the #MeToo movement started, but there's also a basic business reason. We could be so much more productive if we didn't have to spend all those cycles sort of fending off that sometimes subtle harassment, but it sort of exists there, and if we can together say, \"Let's just have an inclusive, respectful environment at work,\" and teach our boys and our girls, I think we'll be far more productive. We'll be our best selves. We'll bring our best selves to work because we'll know we'll be in a comfortable environment.  Shontell: You've had an incredible career, many years ahead of it still, but the point that you've gotten to is just really inspiring. If you're looking back or you're giving someone advice who's just starting their career, what do you wish you had known then, and what would you advise someone who wants to rise to the top like you have?  Johnson: Well, I think the best advice I ever got was just to be myself, and I think once I settled into who I am, I'm quiet, I'm somewhat introverted, and decided that's OK, it's OK to be who I am. Then my career took off. So for someone starting I would say, \"Be who you are. If you are aggressive and assertive that's fine, too. Just embrace who you are because we really need that diversity of thought at work. We don't need a bunch of Peggy Johnsons of any one type.

Microsoft also announced a slate of new features for Teams, including instant language translation.  Slack's emergence as a popular platform for workplace messaging and document-sharing is a threat to Microsoft's long-standing dominance in office productivity software.  Teams now comes bundled with Microsoft Office 365 as the company battles rival offerings from companies including privately-held Slack, Alphabet Inc's Google , Atlassian Corp PLC , Cisco Systems Inc and Facebook Inc .  \"These group messaging tools go far beyond just chat and are becoming a central hub for integrating a variety of business applications into a single user interface,\" said Alan Lepofsky, analyst with Constellation Research. \"They are essentially the new inbox.\"  Microsoft has raced to make Teams a viable competitor after realizing several years ago that Slack was making inroads with big customers. A former Microsoft Office executive told Reuters that learning of the widespread adoption of Slack at Walt Disney Co in early 2015 was an especially important wake-up call.  \"It's one thing when an app gains traction with startups in Silicon Valley, that happens all the time,\" said the former employee, who asked not to be named. \"But it's another when your biggest, longest-tenured customers start adopting it, and then you realize you have to respond.\"  San Francisco-based Slack said in September that it had 6 million daily users and more than 50,000 paying teams. It has not published new figures since then.  Microsoft has not released comparable figures for Teams.  Slack has a big lead when it comes to third-party applications, with more than 1,000 compared to 250 for Teams.  Teams is still not as simple to use as Slack and lacks the depth of functionality, said Wayne Kurtzman, an analyst with the research firm IDC.  \"As great as Microsoft Teams has done in the past year, it's still not as mature of a product,\" Kurtzman said.  Microsoft says it is gaining ground, pointing to customers such as Navistar, the manufacturer of trucks and buses. Navistar moved about a thousand employees onto Teams last year, choosing it over Slack due to its long-time relationship with Microsoft, said Terry Kline, Navistar chief information officer.  \"We looked at Slack, and we didn't see any significant advantage,\" Kline told Reuters in a phone interview.  The move has reduced the company's use of email by 3 percent, he added.  Other Teams customers include Macy's, General Motors, General Electric, ConocoPhillips and Nascar, according to Microsoft.  \"It's surprised all of us how extremely well it's doing,\" Microsoft Teams General Manager Lori Wright told Reuters.

Microsoft has been losing ground to other cloud computing and enterprise software-as-a-service competitors, namely Amazon, but the company could leverage LinkedIn and similarly aggressive acquisitions to kick the unit into high gear, one analyst says.  \"Given that we believe Microsoft feels emboldened with the success of LinkedIn, we think such a renewed focus on SaaS applications could include M&A,\" BMO Capital Markets analyst Keith Bachman said in a note to clients Thursday. \"One area that we think could be a new growth opportunity within the SaaS market is in HCM, or talent management in particular, which would further leverage LinkedIn.\"  Microsoft purchased LinkedIn for $26.2 billion in June 2016.

Microsoft  While Microsoft dominates the global market for classroom PCs, Google Chrome OS rules the roost in the United States.  Microsoft is teaming up with partners including Lenovo to bring a new line of cheap, sub-$300 PCs to market, to take on Google's low-cost Chromebooks.  Microsoft says that a Windows PC is more capable than a Chromebook \u2014 Windows 10 lets you run software like Minecraft or the full version of Microsoft Office.  Minecraft is getting a new chemistry module for students.  Google has all but captured the market for American classrooms \u2014 analyst firm Futuresource estimates that in the third quarter of 2017, Google's low-cost Chromebooks accounted for 59.8% of the laptop market for K-12 education, compared to Microsoft Windows devices' 22.3% share.  But Microsoft would be quick to remind you that this doesn't tell the whole story: That 22.3% share is up from 18.4% the quarter before, and Microsoft says, up 4% from the same period in 2016. And, worldwide, Windows still reigns supreme: In that same third quarter of 2017, Windows accounted for 66.5% of global K-12 classroom PC shipments.  Now, Microsoft is striking back against Google's domestic dominance, with a series of announcements designed to make Windows PCs, Microsoft Office 365, and even the Minecraft video game sensation more appealing for education customers at home and abroad.  Chief among those announcements: New laptops for the classroom, priced between $189 and $299, manufactured by partners Lenovo and JP. These laptops will run Windows 10 S, a version of the operating system streamlined for better battery life and performance \u2014 at the big tradeoff of only being able to install apps from the Microsoft Store.  Microsoft Corporate VP Yusuf Mehdi tells Business Insider that Microsoft is trying to undercut the price advantage of Chromebooks, which often sell for under $299. But because these PCs can run the full versions of Windows software, including Microsoft Office and Minecraft, they offer \"none of the compromises of a Chromebook.\"  Mehdi gives Google credit where he believes credit is due: He says that Chromebooks didn't actually steal any marketshare away from Microsoft, per se; Google just discovered a previously-unmet demand for low-priced laptops and \"made it affordable to have a computer in the classroom.\" And although Apple has had a strong business in schools, but its products are much more expensive.  A new Chemistry Module for Minecraft: Education Edition will let students play around with both atoms and chemical compounds, in the safety of the virtual world. Microsoft  Now, says Mehdi, the burden is on Microsoft to go out and prove that a Windows machine is more capable than a Chromebook of the same price. Many of the low-cost Windows devices announced on Monday will boast touchscreens and stylus support. Some, will even be compatible with certain virtual reality headsets, a feature schools love, Mehdi adds.  Beyond the hardware, Mehdi highlights updates to the software in the Office 365 for Education suite. For instance, the Microsoft Teams chat tool is getting an iOS and Android app for education users. And Minecraft: Education Edition, which is already widely used to teach programming, is getting a chemistry module for students to perform science experiments in the safety of the virtual world.  According to Futuresource, the time could be right for Microsoft, too: Many schools bought their Chromebooks for students in 2014 and 2015, meaning that they could be looking to do a wide-scale replacement in 2018. That's an opportunity for Microsoft to convince them to switch to Windows \u2014 an opportunity he says the company doesn't intend to squander.  \"We finally feel like we have a strong value proposition,\" says Mehdi.", "stock": "MSFT"}, {"url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-has-a-new-plan-to-steal-google-dropbox-and-box-customers-2018-2", "label": -1, "source": "business-insider", "date": "2018-02-06", "article": "AP  Microsoft is going after Google, Box, and Dropbox customers with a new offer for its OneDrive for Business cloud storage service.  If your business is already using cloud storage from one of those three companies, Microsoft will give you OneDrive for free for the duration of your contract with them.  The fine print: Your company needs to have more than 500 users, and you can't already be a customer of OneDrive or the Office 365 cloud productivity suite.  Google, Box, and Dropbox, be warned: Microsoft is coming for your customers.  On Tuesday, Microsoft announced a new offer to entice companies to use its OneDrive cloud storage service. If you're a business that's already using any of those three competitors, Microsoft will give you its OneDrive for Business service for free until your contract with the other company ends.  The promotional offer comes with some caveats: You have to commit to 500 seats or more, meaning small businesses won't really be able to take advantage. You have to not already be a customer of OneDrive, or of the Microsoft Office 365 productivity suite. And the deal is only good through June 18th.  The big idea is to give customers a taste of what Microsoft can offer, without having to worry about their existing commitments to those other vendors. Microsoft is confident enough that those big customers will sign on, it seems, that they're willing to swallow the cost. In general, Microsoft is seeing solid growth in its subscription cloud businesses, bolstering its confidence here.  As for why customers would want to make the change: Microsoft is touting the deep integrations between its own OneDrive service and Microsoft Office. While Microsoft Office is compatible with cloud storage from those other companies to a certain degree, there are some special features that Microsoft reserves for its own offerings.  For instance, you need OneDrive if you want to have multiple authors simultaneously work on a single Office document in real-time from the computer or smartphone apps. And OneDrive integrates with other Microsoft apps like the team portal SharePoint, so files stay in sync across the suite.  Plus, Microsoft Global Senior Director Seth Patton hypes up the security of OneDrive, saying that it means most customers' most stringent requirements.  \"That's a pretty big deal,\" Patton tells Business Insider.  Still, with this offer, Microsoft might find itself preaching to the choir somewhat. While Box, Dropbox, and Google's G Suite certainly have a certain number of large-enterprise customers, they're mostly known for appealing to smaller and midsize businesses.  Microsoft is already generally considered to be the leader in large companies, given the fact that its Office suite is, and remains, the gold standard in the productivity market. Still, with analysts urging Dropbox to pursue an enterprise-focused strategy ahead of its purported IPO, perhaps Microsoft is just trying to consolidate its lead ahead of time.  After this offer expires, customer will have to pay for OneDrive for Business like usual. Plans start at $5 per user per month, or else you could opt in for a $12.50 per user per month subscription to the Office 365 cloud productivity suite \u2014 at which point you'd get access to all of the Office applications, like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, too.", "stock": "MSFT"}, {"url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-stock-price-down-after-earnings-fail-to-impress-wall-street-2018-2", "label": -1, "source": "business-insider", "date": "2018-02-01", "article": "Getty Images/Stephen Brashear  Microsoft's stock fell on Thursday morning after the company reported modest quarterly earnings.

Watch Microsoft's stock move in real time here.    Shares of Microsoft slipped after the company reported quarterly profits that modestly beat expectations, but failed to enthuse investors.  Microsoft was down 1.45% at $93.63 in pre-market trading on Thursday.  Though Microsoft reported better-than-expected earnings of $0.96 a share on revenue of $28.92 billion, the company was also hit with a one-time charge of $13.8 billion due to the newly-passed tax law.  The \"lack of accelerated capital return\" and the newly guided corporate tax rate below 21% \"may modestly disappoint,\" said RBC Analyst Ross MacMillan. He said that the technology company remains focused on reinvesting in growth rather than returning profits, in the form of a buyback or special dividend, to investors.  Yet revenues from Microsoft's Productivity and Business Processes segment, which includes Microsoft Office, the Office 365 cloud suite, and LinkedIn, grew 25% year-over-year and its Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes its Azure platform, grew 15% during the same period. Revenue from its personal computing segment posted modest growth of 2%.  Still, MacMillan raised his price target to $105, up 12% from its current price.  He believes that Microsoft could see more upside with an acceleration of Azure and LinkedIn services and offerings, the wider adoption of the Azure Stack, Microsoft's hybrid cloud platform, and a markedly improved commercial PC market, as well as improved Windows performance.

Following the hire, Microsoft says it will bring some of the features Chalkup had built to the Microsoft Teams for Education product experience.  Chalkup was founded in 2013 by CEO Justin Chando, who\u2019s joining Microsoft as a result of this deal, and CTO Tim Costa, who left Chalkup in 2015.  The startup offered a classroom collaboration platform where teachers could share resources and assignments with students and could discuss course topics, among other things. The company says educators and students from 1 in 3 universities and 1 in 5 high schools in the U.S. had used Chalkup at some point.  However, with the arrival of Microsoft Teams for Education in March 2017, Chalkup faced a serious competitor \u2013 and one that comes bundled with Microsoft Office 365 for Education \u2013 for free.  As the two products compete in the same space \u2013 collaboration software for educators and students, both Microsoft and Chalkup realized they may do better to join forces.  \u201cIn spending time with the amazing people at Microsoft, it was clear that we were completely aligned in our mission for connecting classrooms, sparking student collaboration, and finding new and innovative ways to work together. We knew Microsoft would be a great fit and we\u2019re thrilled for what the future holds for our customers,\u201d said Chando, in the official announcement.  Moving forward, Chalkup says some of its best-loved features will be integrated into Microsoft Teams. However, the companies so far have only disclosed one that\u2019s definitely making the transition: Chalkup\u2019s criteria-based grading rubrics that let teachers give students feedback on their work.  Chalkup\u2019s product is not immediately shutting down, as that would be disruptive in the middle of the school year. Instead, the software will remain available until June 30, 2018. It will also soon add the ability for users to export their course information and move to Microsoft Teams.  Chalkup itself was not a large company \u2013 one founder had left, and it had only raised a small seed round, according to Crunchbase. But Chalkup remained online all these years by being very capital efficient, and had built software that was in demand in the classroom, and as an acquisition target. In fact, the company had multiple acquisition* offers, we understand. (Perhaps one was from Google, given Chalkup\u2019s integrations there?)  Investors described the exit to Microsoft as a great outcome, as well.  Microsoft has requested this should not be characterized as an acquisition \u2013 only a hiring. However, we confirmed money exchanged hands here, so it\u2019s a bit of hair splitting on Microsoft\u2019s part.  \u201cJustin built one of the first education platforms that students really loved to use,\u201d said Wayne Chang, who had invested in the startup alongside Jeff Seibert. (Both had directly invested, but not on behalf of Baseline, where they are LPs). \u201cAnd Jeff and I couldn\u2019t be more excited that Chalkup is joining Microsoft and bringing that approach to schools and classrooms everywhere.\u201d  Today\u2019s news follows shortly after Microsoft Teams\u2019 larger product received its biggest update to date. Last month, Microsoft announced a slew of new features for its Slack competitor, including new app integrations, an app store, improved search and discovery features, and new commands.  Teams\u2019 adoption has been steadily growing. Last September, Microsoft said that 125,000 organizations had adopted the software, but didn\u2019t speak to how many users it has. However, Slack had said around the same time that it had grown to 6 million daily users, 9 million weekly users, and had passed 50,000 paid teams earlier in the year.  *Correction, 2/13/2018 1:30 PM ET: Microsoft says it does not characterize this deal as an acquisition; post updated to reflect this.  \u201cMicrosoft\u2019s goal is always to deliver the most comprehensive and time-saving products for teachers and believe Justin will be a tremendous asset to help Microsoft bring added value to Microsoft Teams,\u201d a spokesperson said.", "stock": "MSFT"}, {"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/03/01/microsoft-advances-several-of-its-hosted-artificial-intelligence-algorithms/", "label": 0, "source": "techcrunch", "date": "2018-03-01", "article": "Microsoft Cognitive Services is home to the company\u2019s hosted artificial intelligence algorithms. Today, the company announced advances to several Cognitive Services tools including Microsoft Custom Vision Service, the Face API and Bing Entity Search .  Joseph Sirosh, who leads the Microsoft\u2019s cloud AI efforts, defined Microsoft Cognitive Services in a company blog post announcing the enhancements, as \u201ca collection of cloud-hosted APIs that let developers easily add AI capabilities for vision, speech, language, knowledge and search into applications, across devices and platforms such as iOS, Android and Windows.\u201d These are distinct from other Azure AI services, which are designed for developers who are more hands-on, DIY types.  The idea is to put these kinds of advanced artificial intelligence tools within reach of data scientists, developers and any other interested parties without any of the normal heavy lifting required to build models and get results with the myriad of testing phases that are typically involved in these types of exercises.  For starters, the company is moving the Custom Vision Service from free preview to paid preview, which is the final step before becoming generally available. Sirosh writes that this service helps \u201cdevelopers to easily train a classifier with their own data, export the models and embed these custom classifiers directly in their applications, and run it offline in real time on iOS, Android and many other edge devices.\u201d  Andy Hickl, who works in the Cognitive Services group as principal group program manager, says the tool is designed to help companies identify similar entities in an automated way such as not only recognizing that a particular picture is a dog, but that\u2019s it\u2019s a specific kind of dog or a dog that belongs to a particular person.  The Face API, which is generally available as of today, helps identify a specific person from a large group of people in an automated way. With today\u2019s release the tool allows developers to create groups of up to a million people. Hickl says this is significant because up until now, many face recognition algorithms could only recognize a handful of faces, useful as far as it goes, but not truly scalable like this, he pointed out.  Finally, the Bing Entity Search algorithm enables developers to embed Bing search results in any application. So for example, you could retrieve search results within any tool narrowed down by any Bing entity such as image or website.

What\u2019s more, these voice capabilities will extend to IP phones and conference room devices, as well.  This feature alone could be a big selling point for Microsoft Teams, but it\u2019s one of several the company announced are in the works.  Also coming in 2018 is cloud recording \u2014 another that takes advantages of advances in voice technology in recent years. Microsoft Teams will be able to record meetings with a click, then create an automatic transcription of what was said. Meeting attendees can choose to play back the meeting in full, or just a key part, using the transcription as reference.  This feature will also be advanced in the future to include facial recognition, so meeting remarks can be properly attributed.  Meeting transcription is an area other startups are working in, as well. For example, recently launched Otter is offering an automatic transcription tool for meetings, as is Voicera, which just landed $20 million for its automated note-taking assistant. (It wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see Slack snatch up a company like this in the future, to help it compete by way of native voice and transcription features.)  Microsoft is also promising inline messaging translations between languages in channels and chat; a background blur option for video calls (great for meetings from home offices); proximity detection for adding available Skype Room Systems to meetings; and mobile sharing in meetings.  This last item will allow attendees to share a live video stream, photo or screen share from their mobile device.  In addition to the planned features, Microsoft announced new enterprise-grade calling features arriving today, including consultative transfer and call delegation and federation. It\u2019s also now rolling out Direct Routing, which allows customers to integrate existing telephony infrastructure with Teams for calling.  Related to this, Teams is also now enabled across meeting room devices, including Microsoft Surface Hub; devices from new partners Lenovo and HP (which join Logitech, Crestron and Polycom); Skype Room Systems; new solutions from BlueJeans, Pexip and Polycom that will connect with Teams; new desk phones from AudioCodes and Yealink and new conference room phones from Crestron, Polycom and Yealink, all of which will run a native Teams app; and new mobile phone stations from Plantronics.  Microsoft today gave an update on Teams\u2019 traction, given it\u2019s now been a year since its worldwide debut. There are today 200,000 organizations in 181 markets and 39 languages on Teams, including A.P. Moller-Maersk, ConocoPhillips, Macy\u2019s, NASCAR, Navistar, RLH Corporation and Technicolor and, as of another announcement today, General Motors.  By comparison, Slack reports 9 million weekly active users across 50,000+ paying companies in over 100 countries, according to stats on its website. It said in September it had grown to more than 6 million daily users, as well.", "stock": "MSFT"}, {"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/01/29/microsofts-slack-competitor-teams-gets-its-biggest-update-with-new-app-integrations-and-app-store/", "label": 0, "source": "techcrunch", "date": "2018-01-29", "article": "Microsoft\u2019s Slack competitor, Microsoft Teams, rolled out its biggest update since the software\u2019s launch last year, the company says. The focus of the new set of features is allowing users to better work with apps \u2013 something Microsoft Teams accomplishes via integrations, new search and discovery features, commands, and more.  Some of the features are, in fact, quite Slack-like.  For example, Microsoft Teams now offers a way to search for apps from the new app store where you can browse by category or search by name, category or integration type \u2013 like Project Management or BI. Slack, of course, also has its own app directory, which has allowed it to highlight all the work tools that currently work with its team collaboration resource \u2013 a move that helped it gain traction in the workplace.  In Microsoft\u2019s case, however, there\u2019s a bit more emphasis on the apps your organization has added and assigned to you, as well as those you regularly work with.  A new \u201cpersonal space\u201d displays all the items that you\u2019ve been assigned across your apps, like your tasks in Planner or issues in Jira Cloud, plus those from apps you\u2019ve recently accessed, like OneNote notebooks or videos from Microsoft Stream.  Microsoft even added its own new app called Who, powered by Microsoft Graph. This lets you search across your organization for people by name or topic.  The updated version of Teams also makes it easier to launch apps.  It\u2019s adding the ability to query or command an app from the command box to speed up the process of using the apps. That way, you can search for information from an app, then add a result right into your chat in a single workflow. This process will be improved in time, Microsoft says, and will eventually allow you to do more complex tasks, like creating a new task in your PM app or starting a build in Visual Studio Team Services.  Plus, adding information from an app to a chat has been improved \u2013 as you can now add an interactive card from apps into a chat or channel with just a click, instead of having to screenshot the data then post it.  Teams added slash commands with this update, too.  Similar to Slack, the slash command ( / ) lets you perform tasks or navigate Teams. But you can also use slash commands to do things like setting your status to \u201cAway,\u201d adding users to team, or calling a coworker, the company says.  This new set of features is rolling out starting today, says Microsoft, which means you may not see them immediately, but should soon.

As a result, Microsoft has had to seek new revenue outside of its operating system.  In 2017, as part of that effort to grow, Microsoft announced a new subscription product called Microsoft 365, bringing together Windows, the company\u2019s cloud-centered productivity suite Office 365 and enterprise tooling into a single package.  The introduction of Microsoft 365 presaged the company\u2019s re-organization which, to quote CNBC, \u201crebuilt the company around the cloud instead of Windows.\u201d This seems reasonable; if Windows isn\u2019t going to return to growth, other services have to keep adding top line revenue. Microsoft\u2019s evolution to a cloud-powered, services-focused company is therefore set to continue.  In the pursuit of new, non-Windows top line, Microsoft wagered that it could expand its \u201ccommercial cloud\u201d revenue to a $20 billion run rate by the end of its fiscal 2018. It beat the goal, reaching the $20 billion mark far ahead of the calendar-equivalent date of mid-Summer of this year.  One of those products, Teams, is a component to Office 365 and part of what Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella called a \u201cgrowth opportunity\u201d that is \u201ca lot bigger than anything [his company has] achieved.\u201d  Today we\u2019re going to explore Microsoft\u2019s current actions in one part of the cloud productivity space through the lens of Teams.  Microsoft Teams  Microsoft\u2019s Teams product is a communications tool often compared to Slack . TechCrunch, for example, recently called the software service \u201cMicrosoft\u2019s Slack competitor.\u201d ComputerWorld, in a news item earlier this year, wrote that \u201cMicrosoft turn[ed] up [the] heat on Slack\u201d when it announced new Teams features.  It goes on and on, allowing us to comfortably hold up Microsoft Teams as Redmond\u2019s answer to Slack, a company famous for its quick growth, impressive mind share and its independent status from any major tech company. That last fact remains true despite rumored acquisition interest from Microsoft itself, along with pretty much every big company in the sector you can name.  To see Microsoft invest in its own tool that competes with Slack isn\u2019t surprising. There is a large market for the product, and Redmond is loath to let any rival service cut in on its productivity revenue.  Therefore, if there is a hot productivity tool in the market and Microsoft isn\u2019t going to buy it, it might as well build one of its own. Unsurprisingly, the company has been hard at work doing just that.  Joining a big company when you are a comparatively small company can be arduous.  News that Teams could release a free version made headlines. Teams also picked up guest access in February, its introduction of Cortana integration made it into mainstream tech publications and this week Microsoft announced new \u201cretention policies\u201d for Teams.  All that and Microsoft bought Teams a friend this year in the form of Chalkup, a collaboration company focused on the education world.  In short, Teams is adding new features while building its org chart and expanding access. All good things, certainly. However, it was not too long ago Microsoft spent quite a lot of money to buy a different, distinct collaboration tool. What happened to it?  Yammer  Microsoft bought Yammer in 2012 for $1.2 billion, building out what TechCrunch called, at the time, its \u201cSocial Enterprise Strategy.\u201d And while the Yammer-Microsoft deal was \u201cgreat news\u201d for the company and its investors, it also marked the beginning of the \u201ctough part\u201d for the newly acquired startup.  Joining a big company when you are a comparatively small company can be arduous. And if you do so when the larger company is undergoing a massive change in leadership (Microsoft hired a new CEO two years after the Yammer deal) and a business model change-up (Microsoft bought Nokia in 2014, also two years after the Yammer deal, before closing that strategic idea out years later), it\u2019s probably even harder to integrate.  Externally, that difficulty showed. Following the Microsoft deal, Yammer search volume grew before stagnating and later slipping. The product was eventually switched on for free for Office 365 customers in early 2016, four years after it was purchased. Office 365 itself launched a half-decade before, making the moment a bit long in the works.  But all that is the past, and, notably, Microsoft is putting more emphasis on Yammer today than it has in recent years. That may feel odd, given what we just went over concerning Teams.  To dig into that, Crunchbase News got Microsoft\u2019s Seth Patton on the phone, who explained the company\u2019s thinking. According to the 15-year company veteran who now works on Office 365, Microsoft has two separate views for Teams and Yammer. Teams is built for what Patton calls inner-loop communication: stuff for teams, smaller companies and the like; Yammer, in contrast, is better for outer-loop communication: less tactical decisions and more company-wide communications.  The split between Slack and Teams products and the Yammers and Convos of the world isn\u2019t hokum or mere corporate-speak. I\u2019ve worked in newsrooms that used the mix of tools to allow for simple direct messaging between individuals (Slack) and team-wide threaded communications (Yammer). It takes a little getting used to, but it can flow well if you need that level of inter-party discussion.  Even more interesting than the fact that Yammer is not dead is that Microsoft is actively investing in it. According to Patton, Microsoft\u2019s chiefs \u201cdoubled down\u201d on Yammer while Teams was being brought into the market in late 2016. This gave Yammer about a year of redoubled investment and attention.  Taking all that together, Microsoft is investing in two communications products at the same time, both of which are baked into its productivity suite. So why the huge push now?  Slack: Software\u2019s favorite rocket ship  You are no doubt familiar with Slack\u2019s growth arc. It\u2019s been a nearly chronic narrative in tech for the past few years. And I don\u2019t mean that in a pejorative sense. (I\u2019m as guilty as anyone else.)  But, in case you have a life, here are some highlights: Slack reached ARR of $50 million in December of 2015. In October of 2016, Slack hit the $100 million ARR mark. Then the company bested $200 million last September. That\u2019s darn quick, and investors took notice, showering the company with cash and ever-rising valuations.  One way to get acquired, after all, is to stick out by worrying the biggest companies in the market through growth.  Fueling Slack\u2019s continued growth is a push into the realm of bigger companies. The firm launched Slack Enterprise Grid last January, bringing enterprise-grade management tools to Slack\u2019s product. With Enterprise Grid, Slack can keep going after bigger accounts. (To that point, IBM has more than 200,000 active users on Slack that use Enterprise Grid.)  That quick growth has made Slack an acquisition target. One way to get acquired, after all, is to stick out by worrying the biggest companies in the market through growth. It\u2019s just hard as heck to do, as incumbent revenue numbers are so large that, well, you have to grow fast to become interesting.  An even bigger scrap  As we know, Slack has rebuffed acquisition offers. As a result, we\u2019re seeing Microsoft, the dominant player in the world of productivity, attempt to slow down Slack in an effort to not lose future users and future dollars. Hell, even Google is in on the race. Its Slack competitor launched for early users in February. Facebook is also tinkering around the edges. It\u2019s fun to watch.  But productivity is Microsoft\u2019s cash cow. For Google, it\u2019s a big side project, but nothing compared to its advertising revenue. That puts Microsoft and Slack more up against one another in the enterprise chat fight.  (In mid-March, Microsoft announced that 200,000 organizations now use Teams, up from 125,000 in September of 2017. That\u2019s 60 percent growth in a half-year or so \u2014 a quick growth pace, too.)  What we\u2019ll learn over the next few years is if Microsoft\u2019s enormous enterprise channel can be leveraged enough to slow Slack\u2019s growth, or if Slack\u2019s momentum can actually capture a piece of the productivity market and hold onto it.  It\u2019s a startup against a platform company, a classic enough battle. But with big tech bigger, richer and more powerful than ever, it\u2019s a more relevant business case than we might think at first blush.

It\u2019s worth stressing that the app isn\u2019t about replacing guide dogs or canes. Instead, it\u2019s all about enriching people\u2019s perception of their surroundings. A guide dog can\u2019t tell you that your favorite store is right around the corner if you\u2019re in an unfamiliar city or what street you are on, after all. With the app, users can set audio beacons for destinations and landmarks. Using GPS and the built-in compass in the phone, the app then generates its spatial audio cues. The mapping data is provided by OpenStreetMap.  \u201cObstacle avoidance is not the problem, we have a dog, a cane and our blindness skills for that,\u201d said Erin Lauridsen, Access Technology Director, LightHouse for the Blind in San Francisco in a blog post today. \u201cThe gap is knowing where things are and being able to decide what\u2019s of interest.\u201d  The app offers three modes: \u2018locate\u2019 tells you where you are, \u2018around me\u2019 calls out four points of interest around you and \u2018ahead of me\u2019 provides the names of five landmarks in front of you.

Back in 2014, the team was working with Windows Phone handsets and was experimenting with bone-conduction headsets. At the time, Microsoft was also hoping to use sensors and beacons in cities to provide additional information like bus arrival times. Today, Windows Phone is no more and the requirement of using a bone-conduction headset has been removed, but the general idea behind Soundscape has always remained the same.

The company says it\u2019s tested the system repeatedly on a sample of around 2,000 sentences from various online newspapers, comparing the result to a person\u2019s translation in the process \u2013 and even hiring outside bilingual language consultants to further verify the machine\u2019s accuracy.  The sample set, called newstest2017, was released just last fall at the research conference WMT17.  It\u2019s surprising, then, how quickly the researchers were able to achieve this milestone \u2013 especially given that machine translation is a problem people have been trying to solve for decades.  Many have even believed that the goal of human parity would never be realized, Microsoft notes.  \u201cHitting human parity in a machine translation task is a dream that all of us have had,\u201d said Xuedong Huang, a technical fellow in charge of Microsoft\u2019s speech, natural language and machine translation efforts, in Microsoft\u2019s blog post. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t realize we\u2019d be able to hit it so soon.\u201d  Getting a machine to understand language at this scale is far more complicated than speech recognition \u2013 something that\u2019s seen a number of advances in recent years. Advances in A.I. and speech recognition have allowed voice assistants to find their way onto our smartphones and in our homes where help consumers with everyday computing tasks, controlling smart home devices, and for news and entertainment purposes.  But asking for a machine translation of a web page or news article still often renders the same hard-to-understand mess of words that, at best, gives you a general idea about what\u2019s being said, but is nearly impossible to grasp with any deep comprehension.  To really understand what\u2019s being said in longer articles, you\u2019d need a person\u2019s help.  But even different human translators may translate a sentence in a slightly different way, with neither being wrong.  \u201cMachine translation is much more complex than a pure pattern recognition task,\u201d said Ming Zhou, assistant managing director of Microsoft Research Asia and head of a natural language processing group that worked on the project. \u201cPeople can use different words to express the exact same thing, but you cannot necessarily say which one is better.\u201d  Recent breakthroughs in A.I. contributed to researchers achieving this milestone, Microsoft also notes.  Deep neural networks, a method of training A.I. systems, allowed the researchers to create more fluent and natural-sounding translations that take into account broader context that the prior approaches, called statistical machine translation.  Microsoft\u2019s researchers also added their own training methods to the system to improve its accuracy \u2013 things they equate to how people go over their own work time and again to make sure it\u2019s right.  The researchers said they used methods including dual learning for fact-checking translations; deliberation networks, to repeat translations and refine them; and new techniques like joint training, to iteratively boost English-to-Chinese and Chinese-to-English translation systems; and agreement regularization, which can generate translations by reading sentences both left-to-right and right-to-left.  Zhou said the techniques used to achieve the milestone won\u2019t be limited to machine translations.  \u201cThis is an area where machine translation research can apply to the whole field of AI research,\u201d Zhou said.  In addition, it could enable more accurate and natural translations across other languages in the future.  The researchers caution the system has not yet been tested on real-time news stories, and there are other challenges that still lie ahead before the technology could be commercialized into Microsoft\u2019s products.  But you can play around with the new translation system here on Microsoft\u2019s website: https://translator.microsoft.com/neural. (This is not the production system, and may run slower at times, the site warns.)  The system will show a sentence in Chinese (simplified), which is then translated two ways, with the more perfected translation on the right to demonstrate the improvements.  Machine translation is something researchers at Google have been working on as well, including with its own machine learning technique for Chinese-English queries that also uses neural nets. These advances has already been put to work to improve Google\u2019s consumer-facing products, like Google Translate\u2019s app, and its integrations in Google search.

This is part of a wider strategy that is designed to remove some of the complexity associated with gathering, processing and incorporating data into applications.  Microsoft is essentially giving customers access to the same set of tools and services it has used internally to build Dynamics 365, its enterprise suite of tools that includes CRM, marketing automation and field service along with enterprise resource planning tools (ERP).  While the company has been allowing third party developers to build application on the platform for about 18 months with its Power Apps tools, they haven\u2019t been able to take advantage of the data under the hood without some heavy lifting. Microsoft aims to change that with the Common Data Service.  \u201cWhat that service means, practically speaking, is that it\u2019s not only a place to store data, but a model (schema) that is stamped out there with everything you would need to build a business app around [elements] such as contacts, events, customers [and so forth], Ryan Cunningham, Microsoft program manager for Power Apps explained. This allows the programmer to take advantage of pre-built relationships and rules and how they should be enforced without having to code them from scratch.  Cunningham points out that they tried to make it fairly simple to build the apps, while still providing a level of customization and the ability to use Microsoft data or data from another source.

True to the name, Simplygon allowed companies to optimize 3D data and simplify (reduce) polygon counts of 3D files for devices that might not have the compute to handle them in their raw glory.  In the past this has been a much easier solution but it still required a fair amount of leg work from developers.

Today, the company is announcing some changes that will expand its sights beyond gaming and hook its claws into the enterprise world, specifically the manufacturing space, as it adds support for JT and STEP file formats that are among the most common CAD file types.

The overall program consists of 10 courses that range from introductions to AI and Python for data science to a class on ethics for AI developers and lots of hands-on work with training models. Most of the 10 required courses should take about eight to 16 hours to complete.  In addition to the AI class, Microsoft also today announced a similar program for entry-level software developers. This edX-based program consists of 13 courses that teach students the basics of software development, with a focus on Python and JavaScript. What\u2019s maybe more important than just teaching those languages, though, is that the course also looks at basics like data structures and how to use GitHub and other tools to write code professionally.

Windows 10 S is Microsoft\u2019s streamlined version of the operating system (OS) that only allows apps to be installed from its Microsoft Store, whereas Windows 10 (Pro) regularly allows you to install programs you want from any source.  The commercial version of the Surface Laptop also starts with a $200 price hike on account of the laptop starting with 8GB of memory versus the consumer-grade model\u2019s 4GB to start. Then there's the embedded cost of the Windows 10 Pro OS, which is normally $200 on its own.  (If you want 8GB of memory on a normal Surface Laptop with Windows 10 S, you are forced to cough up $1,299 for that and 256GB of storage as well.)  With that, you\u2019re saving 100 bucks on the pre-installation of Windows 10 Pro if you were to install the OS on a Surface Laptop after, say, Microsoft\u2019s newly-extended March 31, 2018 deadline for free upgrades from Windows 10 S to Pro.  Of course, this move seems to be Microsoft getting ahead of that deadline for Windows 10 S users to make the switch \u2013 or, rather, upgrade.  What does this mean for Windows 10 S?  Microsoft hasn\u2019t added any new SKUs or plans to offer Windows 10 Pro on the original Surface Laptop, but users can still get free upgrades to Windows 10 Pro until March 31. Whether Microsoft will offer a similar option to general consumers after the fact, or just point them to this new model, is unclear.  Beyond this option in pre-installed OS, there doesn\u2019t seem to be any difference between the two versions of the Surface Laptop. So, it appears that Microsoft is appealing to business customers that need the freedom and versatility of full-fat Windows 10.  What does that say for Windows 10 S? Not much more than reiterating the fact that the OS is ideal for users in education and those that don\u2019t want to worry about all the security of their device \u2013 and that\u2019s about it.  This move doesn\u2019t imply anything about the fate of Windows 10 S, but rather refines the definition of its purpose in the scheme of Windows 10 offerings.  But, if you want the incredible look and feel of the Surface Laptop with the full Windows 10 experience, you better grab one before March 31 and upgrade for free. Otherwise, such a setup is going to cost you another 200 bucks at minimum.

It\u2019s likely Microsoft is trying to make it clear that verbal abuse on any of its platforms will not be tolerated.  The fact that Microsoft says it'll be investigating \"alleged violations\" of these terms of service suggests that users will have to be reported by someone before Microsoft picks up on your activity.

And it\u2019s a move which has immediately been criticized by some Linux fans, as you can imagine, drawing comparisons with Microsoft and Windows 10 which has had an infamously checkered history regarding hoovering up user data.  Will Cooke, Ubuntu Desktop Manager at Canonical, explained that this is happening because the company wants to work on the elements that matter most to Ubuntu users, and the data collected will help the firm decide what to focus on going forward.  That data will include the version of Ubuntu being installed, basic spec of the PC \u2013 CPU family, memory, disk size, GPU, display resolution, manufacturer \u2013 along with details of the third-party software selected, and time taken for the installation, among other information.  The OS will also gather data on location, although this will simply be the location selected by the user during installation \u2013 no IP address information will be collected. In other words, the data collected will be completely anonymized, and transferred via HTTPS for obvious security reasons.  Cooke further explained that some manner of checkbox option would be added to the Ubuntu installer, asking whether the user wants to \u2018send diagnostics information to help improve Ubuntu\u2019, but that this would be ticked by default.  In other words, data collection would be an opt-out affair, rather than a decision to opt-in.  Trend spotting  You might be forgiven for thinking this is just a case of a one-time firing off of info post-installation of Ubuntu, but Canonical also intends to install Popcon on consenting user\u2019s PCs \u2013 to help pick out trends in package usage \u2013 along with Apport to send crash reports (anonymously).  All the data gathered, incidentally, would be made public, allowing everyone to see the percentages of Ubuntu users who use certain hardware.  As mentioned, there has been some predictably negative reaction in the chatter we\u2019ve seen online, with one of the main points of controversy being the fact that the default setting is on rather than off.  Although this is perhaps less of an issue for Linux users than, say, Windows, as generally speaking open source OS devotees are a bit more clued-up as to what they\u2019re doing during installation, and more likely to read prompts rather than gloss over things.  Still, that\u2019s not exactly an excuse for Canonical, and it would certainly look better if the scheme was opt-in, rather than opt-out. Incidentally, if you don\u2019t turn this feature off during installation, you\u2019ll be able to do so later on in Gnome\u2019s privacy panel.  Furthermore, bear in mind that this isn\u2019t going to happen for sure \u2013 it\u2019s just what Canonical is planning, so there could be a course change yet.  But if the move does go ahead as planned, it\u2019s likely that the top rival distros, such as Mint, Fedora and Debian, will be rubbing their hands together at a potential influx of new users migrating to a different flavor of Linux. For some folks, even the perception that Canonical is taking some steps down the same road as Microsoft will likely be too much to bear.

These can work on desktop or mobile, but on the phone the experience is particularly important as it allows developers to create something that can work across a variety of devices.  Wrapping it up  Microsoft has been building this support into its Edge browser, and is pretty jazzed about the whole thing , it seems. However, it\u2019s also confirmed that those using the first wave of PWAs for mobile (there are around 10 at the moment) won\u2019t be able to get full functionality, such as notifications.  That\u2019s a pretty serious difference between a native app and the PWA experience, and it\u2019s hardly going to encourage users to make the effort to pin them to their home screen, which is the point of a PWA in the first place.

It would be unfair to take a single tweet as confirmation that Microsoft has decided for certain that it won't improve the PWA experience on mobile, so it could all change.

Project Zanzibar is a portable mat that comes with NFC (near field communication) functionality \u2013 the same technology that allows you to quickly pay in shops and restaurants by tapping your smartphone on a payment device.  The mat also has capacitive sensing to detect multi-touch gestures and movement, allowing it to identify physical objects placed on it.  In a blog post detailing the project, the research team behind it explained where their inspiration came from. \u201cWe began with a simple thought,\" they explained. \"What if we could blur the divide between the physical and digital worlds? What if you could play with toys and cards and blocks, while watching your actions come alive onscreen?\u201d  Image credit: Microsoft  Play time  The blog also outlines some potential uses for Project Zanzibar, which the team envisions could drastically change the way we interact with PCs.  Playing with toys is one such example. Standard toys could be placed on the mat and given globally unique IDs, enabling data to be stored for each object.  While combining physical toys with NFC chips and augmented reality is nothing new (the popular Skylanders, Lego Dimensions and Nintendo\u2019s Amiibo toys all use variations of the technology), what\u2019s exciting about Project Zanzibar is that it can work with any off-the-shelf toy, not just specially made (and expensive) figurines.  In tests, kids played with the toys on the mat, using a tablet running a movie making app to create stop-motion videos.  As the blog explains: \u201cProject Zanzibar invites children to bring their toys into an interactive experience and watch them come alive through sound, visuals and special effects. The team had observed kids spending hours making stop-action movies to share online.\u201d  The mat can also detect the location of toys on the mat, and by sensing where certain toys are, and if they are near other toys, can broadcast lines of dialog, telling a story as the children play.  While some people may be concerned that Project Zanzibar is aiming to stop kids using their imaginations when playing, and instead use a computer to create sounds and special effects, the researchers claim to be taking a different angle by changing how children interact with PCs.  Many kids spend more time interacting with a 2D screen than playing with physical toys, and the Project Zanzibar team want to change this.  As Haiyan Zhang, a Project Zanzibar researcher, says: \u201cThe physical world is such a rich place, abundant with dimensionality and materiality. Our vision is to tap into that richness and imbue it with that digital magic and our hope is that Project Zanzibar is a step in that direction.\u201d  Image credit: Microsoft  Help with learning  The team is also keen to stress the teaching possibilities of Project Zanzibar, inspired by the Montessori Method, a theory developed in the early 20th century by Maria Montessori, which looked at how important physical activity is for helping children to learn. \u201cWe took traditional Montessori exercises for young children and extended them with digital content and feedback using Project Zanzibar,\u201d the blog explains.  The team is also looking at creating a range of educational apps, which include spelling and coding lessons, that use physical cards and allow the children to use natural, tactile, actions to interact with the apps.  How does it work?  The blog also delves into how the Project Zanzibar prototype works, including how the NFC technology can detect the position of objects, and how the mat can be rolled up to be easily portable. It can also detect when objects are stacked on each other and in which order, which is all pretty clever.  Items don\u2019t need to be placed directly on the mat, which can detect NFC objects from 30mm above. It can also recognize gestures made above the mat, such as drawing shapes in the air. The mat connects to a computer via USB or Bluetooth.  The team has released a technical paper providing even more information about the project.  It\u2019s all pretty exciting stuff, and we\u2019re looking forward to seeing the fruits of Project Zanzibar\u2019s labors.

As we\u2019ve said before, there are notable issues with the new wave of so-called \u2018always connected\u2019 PCs \u2013 some of which are more obvious than others \u2013 and one of the main ones was the fact that these devices can only run 32-bit software, thus limiting the selection of applications available.  Microsoft had already said that this picture would change at some point in the future, and according to an Engadget report, Erin Chappie, general manager for Windows, confirmed that an ARM64 SDK will be officially announced at the upcoming Build conference which kicks off on May 7.  This SDK will be available for both UWP (Universal Windows Platform) apps as well as traditional desktop apps.  Developer\u2019s decision  However, pushing the kit out is just the first step in the process. Developers themselves will have to recompile their own applications for ARM64 compatibility, of course, and there\u2019s not much Microsoft can do if devs decide it\u2019s not worth the trouble.  That said, this is still a big step forward in opening up the number of potential apps which are available to those who have taken the plunge with a Snapdragon notebook, and at least the move is happening sooner rather than later.  The big selling point of these laptops like the HP Envy x2 is their extensive battery life (20 hours) and built-in LTE connectivity thanks to the Qualcomm chip inside.  However, there are question marks over the sort of performance you\u2019ll see from 64-bit apps, and concerns about the power available from the Snapdragon 835 which powers the first wave of notebooks.  That chip has already been criticized in some quarters when it comes to how it performs when running emulated desktop x86 apps, and there are arguments that these always connected PCs will need to step up to a more powerful processor in order to deliver truly solid levels of performance.", "stock": "MSFT"}, {"url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/bill-gates-warns-about-cryptocurrencies-saying-they-cause-deaths-in-a-fairly-direct-way", "label": 0, "source": "techradar", "date": "2018-03-01", "article": "Bill Gates has something to say on cryptocurrencies, and he definitely doesn\u2019t approve of the virtual coins, with Microsoft\u2019s founder even accusing them of being to blame for deaths in a \u201cfairly direct way\u201d.  Gates made his comments in a Reddit \u2018ask me anything\u2019 session in which someone asked him what his opinion was on cryptocurrencies.  Gates replied: \u201cThe main feature of cryptocurrencies is their anonymity. I don't think this is a good thing. The Government\u2019s ability to find money laundering and tax evasion and terrorist funding is a good thing.  \u201cRight now cryptocurrencies are used for buying fentanyl and other drugs so it is a rare technology that has caused deaths in a fairly direct way. I think the speculative wave around ICOs and crypto currencies is super risky for those who go long.\u201d  Essentially, then, Gates is concerned about the usage of cryptocurrencies on the dark web, where they can be used to purchase the likes of drugs, and of course all manner of otherwise illegal goods.  Unsurprisingly, he isn\u2019t the only one to think along these lines, including the authorities themselves. Indeed, the UK government recently equated cryptocurrency with criminal currency, and is trying to guard against virtual coins being used for the likes of money-laundering or tax evasion by regulating larger transactions on exchange platforms (this is something that will be happening across the EU, in fact).

So, if you\u2019ve held off from installing previous titled Windows 10 updates on account of their lengthy installation times, Microsoft wants to do better by you. The company made the announcement as part of a Windows Insider blog post , showcasing gradual improvement over the past few major Windows 10 updates.  For instance, Microsoft admitted a total \u2018offline\u2019 installation time of 82 minutes on average back when the Creators Update of April 2017, which improved to 51 minutes with the Fall Creators Update of October 2017. Now, within Insider Preview builds, the company says to have pared this down time to just 30 minutes on average.  Offline time goes online  To explain why we\u2019re quoting the word \u2018offline\u2019 here, Microsoft looks at operating system (OS) installations occurring in two different states: online and offline. What you might consider the OS installation, the growing percentage atop a blue screen, is just this \u2018offline\u2019 state \u2013 a considerable amount of installation is done while you\u2019re still using the computer, before it restarts.  \u2018Online\u2019 in this context includes anything that\u2019s done in the background while the computer is still in use, before the restarts begin. Meanwhile, \u2018offline\u2019 includes everything that\u2019s done either just before or after the computer restarts, usually on a blue screen.  To achieve these faster installation times, Microsoft has gradually moved more of these \u2018offline\u2019 processes into the \u2018online\u2019 category, particularly now that \u2018user content is prepared for migration\u2019 and the \u2018new operating system is placed into a temporary working directory\u2019 during this first phase, as per Microsoft\u2019s blog post.  So, if you \u2013 like most of the world \u2013 consider the \u2018offline\u2019 state of an OS installation the whole kit and kaboodle, then Windows 10 installations just got a helluva lot faster.  As Microsoft likes to brag, these changes have reduced the overall \u2018offline\u2019 \u2013 again, the time in which you cannot interact with the computer \u2013 installation time to not much longer than, yes, making a sandwich.

On Tuesday the Supreme Court will consider if U.S. internet providers can subvert federal law and public safety.  At issue in Microsoft v. U.S. is whether warrants issued under the 1986 Stored Communications Act apply to records stored on the cloud. The law allows the government to obtain records from a U.S. internet provider if there is probable cause of a crime. A special Section 2703 warrant functions like a subpoena since law enforcement doesn\u2019t directly seize records from servers.  In 2013 the U.S. government sought such a warrant for contents associated with an MSN.com email account believed to include evidence of narcotics trafficking. A federal magistrate issued a warrant covering \u201cinformation associated with\u201d the account \u201cstored at premises owned, maintained, controlled, or operated by Microsoft Corporation.\u201d  While Microsoft agreed to disclose records stored on its U.S. servers, it refused to turn over content on its \u201ccloud\u201d servers in Dublin, Ireland. The Redmond, Wash.-based company, which was held in civil contempt, says the law doesn\u2019t authorize extraterritorial warrants. It\u2019s right on this point, but wrong on everything else.  In Morrison (2010) and RJR Nabisco, Inc. (2016), the Supreme Court developed a two-step analysis to determine if a law applies overseas. First, courts must ask whether a law includes a \u201cclear, affirmative indication that [the statutory provision] applies extraterritorially.\u201d If not, the statute is presumed not to be extraterritorial.  But then courts must assess whether a case primarily \u201cinvolves a domestic application of the statute\u201d by looking at its \u201cfocus.\u201d As the Court held in Nabisco, \u201cIf the conduct relevant to the statute\u2019s focus occurred in the United States, then the case involves a permissible domestic application even if other conduct occurred abroad.\u201d  This second part is key in the Microsoft case. There\u2019s no disputing that the Stored Communications Act doesn\u2019t expressly apply to foreign parties. The government could not compel an internet provider based in France to hand over a French citizen\u2019s emails. But as the judge who issued the warrant observed, the government\u2019s application of the law \u201cdoes not criminalize conduct taking place in a foreign country\u201d and doesn\u2019t deploy U.S. cops overseas.  Employees at Microsoft headquarters could obtain records stored on foreign servers with a few keystrokes. Internet providers typically decide where to store data to maximize efficiency. Google cuts up emails into \u201cshards,\u201d which can move between countries within seconds without human intervention. U.S. internet users aren\u2019t entitled to know where in the cloud their records are stored, let alone to recourse under U.S. law if a company moves them.  A federal district judge held that the Microsoft warrant wasn\u2019t extraterritorial since the disclosure of records to the government occurs in the U.S. But a Second Circuit Court of Appeals panel disagreed in 2016, and tech companies have since resisted warrants for data stored overseas. While the circuit refused to hear the case en banc, Judges Jos\u00e9 Cabranes, Dennis Jacobs, Reena Raggi and Christopher Droney wrote an incisive dissent on the far-reaching implications of the panel\u2019s rogue ruling, which conflicts with every other district and magistrate decision.  The panel \u201chas substantially burdened the government\u2019s legitimate law enforcement efforts; created a roadmap for the facilitation of criminal activity; and impeded programs to protect the national security of the United States and its allies,\u201d the judges explained.  Tech firms argue that a Court decision upholding the government\u2019s authority to compel disclosure of data overseas would cause international friction due to conflicting legal regimes on data privacy. But more than a dozen countries including Australia, France, Ireland, Canada and the U.K. assert this authority. The U.S. would be an outlier.  They also argue that Congress is better situated to resolve the complicated issues of cloud computing that were never envisioned three decades ago. Senators Orrin Hatch and Chris Coons have introduced legislation to modernize the Stored Communications Act and clarify legal obligations for internet providers.  But pending legislation shouldn\u2019t obviate a judicial decision on a black-and-white legal question critical to public safety. Letting a flawed ruling stand would lead to more needless failures in law enforcement.", "stock": "MSFT"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-earnings-what-to-watch-1517394601", "label": -1, "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "date": "2018-01-31", "article": "Microsoft Corp. MSFT -0.53% is scheduled to report fiscal second-quarter earnings after the market closes Wednesday. Here\u2019s what to expect.  EARNINGS FORECAST: Analysts surveyed by S&P Global Market Intelligence expect Microsoft to report per-share earnings of 86 cents under generally accepted accounting principles, up from 80 cents a year earlier. Microsoft no longer reports adjusted figures, reflecting accounting changes it adopted at the start of the fiscal year. The year ago figure reflects that change.  REVENUE FORECAST: Analysts expect Microsoft to post revenue of $28.41 billion, up from $25.83 billion a year earlier. The year-ago figure, too, reflects the new accounting standard.  WHAT TO WATCH:  CLOUDY CONDITIONS: In the last year, Microsoft has emerged as the primary competitor to Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s market-leading cloud-infrastructure business. Three months ago, Microsoft said its commercial-cloud run rate\u2014the last month of sales of its Azure infrastructure services and Office 365 products, multiplied by 12\u2014topped $20 billion, nine months ahead of the company\u2019s target. RBC Capital Markets analyst Ross MacMillan, in a recent research report, said he expects 85% growth in Azure revenue and 42% growth in the commercial version of Office 365. Mr. MacMillan estimates Microsoft\u2019s Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes Azure, will climb 10% to $7.4 billion in the quarter, and that its Productivity and Business Processes segment, which includes Office, will grow 24% to $8.9 billion.  PLAYING GAMES: Microsoft\u2019s Xbox videogame console generally does its best business during the holiday quarter, and was primed to do particularly well with the debut of its Xbox One X console in November. Stifel Nicolaus & Co. analyst Brad Reback wrote in a research note that Xbox outsold Sony Corp.\u2019s PlayStation 4 in December, but both were outsold by Nintendo Co.\u2019s Switch. Xbox is part of Microsoft\u2019s More Personal Computing segment, and the console\u2019s gains likely will be offset by continued sluggish PC sales, which track closely to the company\u2019s Windows operating system business. World-wide PC shipments grew 0.7% in the last quarter, according to International Data Corp. Mr. Reback estimates the segment, which is Microsoft\u2019s largest, will grow 0.6% to $11.96 billion.  TAXING TIMES: \u201cTax rate and repatriation commentary from a historically conservative management team represent the key wild card for the quarter,\u201d Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss wrote in a research report. Mr. Weiss estimates Microsoft\u2019s tax rate will decline to 16% as a result of the tax-code overhaul President Donald Trump signed into law in December. A year ago, Microsoft\u2019s effective tax rate was 18%.  CASH CONSIDERATIONS: Mr. Weiss expects Microsoft to eventually repatriate cash held abroad, which totaled $132.1 billion at the end of the fiscal first quarter, behind only Apple Inc.\u2019s $252.3 billion. He didn\u2019t speculate when Microsoft will bring the money to the U.S., but estimates the company will pay about $21 billion in taxes as a result of the tax law, which hits companies with a one-time tax of 15.5% on overseas profits held in cash and other liquid assets. RBC\u2019s Mr. MacMillan wrote about the potential for domestic acquisitions and shareholder returns through dividends or buybacks.

Though Microsoft doesn\u2019t disclose revenue for those businesses, it said Azure jumped 98% and Office 365 grew 41%. In the previous quarter, Azure gained 90% and Office 365 grew 42%.  Its Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes Azure, climbed 15% to $7.8 billion. Its Productivity and Business Processes segment, which includes Office, gained 25% to $8.95 billion.  Overall, Microsoft posted a loss of $6.3 billion, or 82 cents a share, compared with a profit of $6.27 billion, or 80 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue grew 12% to $28.92 billion.  Excluding the impact of the tax law, Microsoft reported a profit of $7.5 billion, or 96 cents a share.  Analysts surveyed by S&P Global Market Intelligence expected Microsoft to report per-share earnings of 86 cents on revenue of $28.41 billion.  Shares, which have climbed nearly 50% in the past year to set records, fell a penny to $95 in after-hours trading.  The company\u2019s adjusted tax rate, which doesn\u2019t count the big charge, was 18%, up slightly from a year ago. Looking ahead, Ms. Hood said it expects a 16% tax rate for the second half of the fiscal year, plus or minus 2 percentage points. For fiscal 2019, the company expects the tax rate to be slightly below the new U.S. corporate rate of 21%.  Microsoft rose to its former tech dominance on the strength of Windows, its PC operating system. And while the More Personal Computing segment that includes Windows is Microsoft\u2019s largest, it is also the company\u2019s slowest growing.  That is in part because growth in world-wide PC sales remains sluggish, inching up only 0.7% in the last quarter, according to International Data Corp. More Personal Computing, though, gained 2% to $12.17 billion in the latest period.  In a conference call with Wall Street analysts, Chief Executive Satya Nadella said investments in security technology helped Microsoft quickly address the recent threats from the Spectre and Meltdown processor vulnerabilities.  \u201cOur investments to make Windows 10 the most secure, always up-to-date operating system enabled us to move quickly to protect customers in the face of these threats,\u201d Mr. Nadella said.  The More Personal Computing segment also includes Microsoft\u2019s Xbox videogame business. The holiday quarter is particularly important for gaming at Microsoft, even more so after the company released its new Xbox One X console in November. In the period, gaming revenue\u2014which includes sales of the Xbox console, Xbox Live subscriptions and transactions, and game and accessory sales\u2014rose 8%.  It has been a year since Microsoft purchased LinkedIn Corp., the professional social network, for $27 billion. In the quarter, LinkedIn added $1.31 billion in revenue.

The company says it shouldn\u2019t have to hand over emails stored on a server in Ireland. Photo: NIALL CARSON/PRESS ASSOCIATION/GETTY IMAGES  WASHINGTON\u2014Technology companies will square off with law enforcement on Tuesday as the Supreme Court hears arguments on whether emails and other customer data stored overseas are subject to U.S. search warrants.  The case is one of several legal battles on law-enforcement access to private online data, and it requires the justices to interpret a law that Congress wrote before email and cloud computing were part of everyday life.  A federal appeals court, in a 2016 case involving Microsoft Corp. , handed a blow to prosecutors by ruling that such warrants can\u2019t be enforced on U.S. providers if the data is stored exclusively on foreign servers. That is the decision the Supreme Court is reviewing.  The case highlights broader tensions between tech titans, which view protecting user privacy as a priority, and authorities who believe privacy concerns should take a back seat to public safety in certain circumstances.  Battle lines have been firmly drawn, with opposing camps warning of serious harm if the court rules against their position.  The Justice Department and state attorneys general say the lower court ruling has hampered investigations into an array of crimes, from narcotics trafficking to arson to child pornography. Emails and electronic evidence are now critical to virtually every criminal investigation, they say.  Microsoft, Google and other technology companies say the Justice Department\u2019s position would leave them stuck between U.S. law enforcement and their obligation to abide by privacy laws in foreign jurisdictions. The companies also say the case could threaten American dominance in the $250 billion cloud-computing industry, because foreign clients won\u2019t use U.S. firms if their data isn\u2019t protected.  Foreign governments also have weighed in, urging the Supreme Court not to interpret U.S. law in a way that intrudes on their sovereignty.  \u201cThis may be a case in which the Supreme Court has no truly satisfying outcome available to it, in part because it is being asked to interpret a 1986 law that is not a good fit for the kind of large-scale, cross-border data-storage practices of today,\u201d said David Newman, a lawyer with Morrison & Foerster LLP who closely follows privacy and data-security issues.  The law at issue is the Stored Communications Act, passed by Congress more than 30 years ago to provide privacy protections for electronic records.  The Justice Department applied for a warrant requiring Microsoft to turn over email information from an account allegedly tied to illegal drug activity in the U.S. A magistrate judge issued the warrant after finding the government had established probable cause that the account was connected to narcotics trafficking.  Newsletter Sign-up  Microsoft handed over some account data that was stored in the U.S. but said it shouldn\u2019t have to hand over the emails, which were stored on a server in Ireland. The company said the government has never suggested that the account holder is a citizen or resident of the U.S.  The Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with Microsoft, ruling the 1986 law didn\u2019t apply beyond U.S. territory.  Microsoft said in its Supreme Court brief that the materials targeted for government seizure are covered by Irish and European Union law. That means the U.S. is seeking to assert the 1986 law beyond domestic borders, which isn\u2019t allowed, the company argued.  Microsoft conceded that U.S. law is outdated but said that was an issue for lawmakers, not judges, to address.  \u201cOnly Congress has the authority and tools to rewrite the statute to strike a new, 21st-Century balance between law-enforcement interests, our relations with foreign nations, the privacy of our citizens, and the competitiveness of our technology industry,\u201d the company said in its brief.  A bipartisan group of lawmakers has introduced legislation to tackle cross-border data issues, but it isn\u2019t clear if the bill will advance in Congress.  The Justice Department said it isn\u2019t seeking to apply the current U.S. law extraterritorially. It noted the government sought disclosure in the U.S., where officials at Microsoft\u2019s headquarters in Redmond, Wash., have ready access to files stored abroad.  \u201cMicrosoft\u2019s employees could prepare that disclosure without leaving their desks in the United States,\u201d Solicitor General Noel Francisco wrote in a court brief.  The department argued that Microsoft\u2019s position could keep investigators from accessing emails and other files even if the subject of the investigation is based in the U.S., if a company chooses to store the consumer\u2019s files overseas.  There is a diplomatic process, governed by legal assistance treaties, that allows the U.S. to request that foreign law-enforcement counterparts share sought-after data, but it can be slow and ineffective, the department said.  WSJ's Joanna Stern \"bumps\" into Peggy Johnson in the elevator at D.Live and asks about Microsoft's next big investments, Solitaire and women in technology. Photo: Andria Chamberlin for The Wall Street Journal  While the case before the court involves Microsoft, the government also took aim at Google, whose network-management practices often involve dividing data from a single customer file into chunks that are moved within an international network of data centers.  If Microsoft\u2019s arguments prevail, then Google\u2019s practices would make its data inaccessible to law enforcement, the Justice Department said.  Google has been involved in several warrant battles with federal and state authorities, agreeing to be held in contempt in some cases for failing to turn over data. The company, like Microsoft, is pushing for a legislative solution.  Since the Second Circuit ruling, legal battles between prosecutors and tech companies have continued in other jurisdictions, and several courts have ruled in the government\u2019s favor, including in California, Florida, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.  A Supreme Court decision is expected by the end of June.

Photo: Elaine Thompson/Associated Press  Microsoft Corp. MSFT -0.53% is downgrading the role of Windows, the storied franchise that put the company atop the personal-computer market at a time when cloud computing didn\u2019t exist.  Now, amid the massive shift in the way computing power is harnessed, the software giant will reorganize its business around its growing Azure cloud-computing operations and its stalwart Office productivity business.  Executive Vice President Terry Myerson, who ran the Windows business, will leave the company, according to an internal email from Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella on Thursday.  The move is designed to focus Microsoft on its biggest areas of growth. In its latest quarter Azure revenue jumped 98% while Office 365 grew 41%, though the company doesn\u2019t give totals for those segments. In the same period, the More Personal Computing unit, which includes Windows, gained 2% to $12.17 billion.  \u201cHaving a deep sense of customers\u2019 unmet and unarticulated needs must drive our innovation,\u201d Mr. Nadella said in the email he sent to employees Thursday morning. \u201cWe can\u2019t let any organizational boundaries get in the way of innovation for our customers. This is why a growth-mindset culture matters.\u201d  Microsoft declined to make executives available for comment.  In a post on Microsoft\u2019s LinkedIn page, Mr. Myerson, who has run the Windows business since 2013, said the day was an \u201cemotional\u201d one for him but expressed his \u201congoing enthusiasm for Microsoft.\u201d  For most of its 43 years, Microsoft and Windows have been nearly synonymous. Under Mr. Nadella\u2019s predecessor, Steve Ballmer, products were sometimes stalled, or even killed, because they didn\u2019t help expand the market for the operating system.  That Mr. Nadella is willing to shift the company\u2019s focus away from Windows illustrates the irreversible migration from personal computing to mobile devices and the web. It also shows how Mr. Nadella is putting his own imprint on the tech giant.  \u201cHe\u2019s clearly not handcuffed by history,\u201d said Stifel Nicolaus & Co. analyst Brad Reback.  Mr. Nadella is able to break from the past because, during his four years as chief executive, Microsoft has emerged as a leader in cloud computing. Its Azure operations is No. 2 behind Amazon.com in the cloud-infrastructure market. And its Office 365 productivity apps and its Dynamics business-software services are rapidly growing, multibillion-dollar businesses.  \u201cThe Microsoft of old could never have made this move,\u201d Mr. Reback said. \u201cBut the pieces were not in place to make the move.\u201d  Mr. Myerson, a 21-year Microsoft veteran, will leave the company and help with the transition \u201cover the coming months,\u201d Mr. Nadella wrote.  \ufeff The company is breaking Windows in pieces. The platform technology, on which Microsoft\u2019s partners build their own devices, apps and services, will now fall under Scott Guthrie, who runs the Azure business. Mr. Guthrie\u2019s unit, called Cloud + AI Platform, will also include the company\u2019s mixed-reality business, including Microsoft\u2019s Hololens device, as well as its artificial-intelligence business.  Microsoft\u2019s devices business, including its Surface lineup of computers, will fall to Rajesh Jha, who has been in charge of Microsoft\u2019s Office group. The new, bigger unit, called Experiences & Devices, will also include Microsoft\u2019s efforts to develop new features in Windows.  In his note, Mr. Nadella called the future of Windows \u201cbright,\u201d as the company pushes to develop features that take advantage of new types of devices and emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence. Nearly 700 million devices run Windows 10, the software\u2019s latest version. All told, some version of Windows is on more than 1.5 billion devices world-wide. In the most recent quarter, the More Personal Computing unit accounted for 42% of Microsoft\u2019s revenue.  \u201cThis is the most sweeping reorg that I can recall,\u201d said Brad Silverberg, who ran the Windows division when Microsoft launched its seminal Windows 95 operating system.  In the 1990s, Windows was so dominant that a federal judge ruled that it was a monopoly. The U.S. Department of Justice sought to break up Microsoft, accusing the company of abusing its dominance in the PC operating system market to crush rivals. The company ultimately signed a consent decree in 2002, agreeing, in part, to make Windows interoperable with non-Microsoft software.  While Microsoft is still focused on building the platform upon which other tech companies run their technology, that focus is now on Azure, said Mr. Silverberg, a venture capitalist who co-founded Fuel Capital, a San Francisco-based firm. He praised Mr. Nadella\u2019s acknowledgment of Windows\u2019 reduced importance.  \u201cHe recognizes the world for what it is, not what it used to be,\u201d Mr. Silverberg said.

In one way it\u2019s the best: By nearly eliminating the bezel around the display, Dell squeezed the XPS 13 into a smaller body than all of its competitors. Without those big borders, the screen just looks better. The XPS 13 scored the second-best time in my battery tests, it has all the right chips and features, and it looks like it cost good money.  But\u2026 that tiny bezel forced Dell to move the webcam down below the screen, which is a terrible place. Rather than framing my face, the camera stares up my nose. (Dell says most users don\u2019t mind the placement.)  The bigger problem is that the XPS 13 you want costs $1,200. The standard model comes with a paltry four gigs of RAM and 128 gigs of storage\u2014neither of which will suffice.  Microsoft | Surface Pro $958 Battery Looks Power  Versatility  PROS  CONS  Hard to use on your lap; low-end processor  Light, thin and versatile; most tablet-like of the bunch  The Portable One  Like the best camera, the best laptop is the one you have with you. No Windows computer combines portability and functionality quite like Microsoft Corp.\u2019s Surface Pro, the tablet/laptop hybrid that inspired so many competitors. It\u2019s the size and shape of an iPad, with the full power of Windows.  Unfortunately, all that versatility compromises the Surface Pro\u2019s utility, and I don\u2019t just mean the smaller screen. And, because the crucial keyboard accessory sells separately for $160, it\u2019s deceptively expensive. (I\u2019ve included it in my pricing, because you need it.) The only way to hit the $1,000 target and still get the whole kit is to buy the cheapest model, which uses a vastly underpowered processor. You might opt for Microsoft\u2019s other offering in this range, the Surface Laptop but, as comfortable as it is to use, it doesn\u2019t measure up to my other picks.  | Swift 3 Acer $999 Battery Looks Power  Versatility  PROS  CONS  Big and heavy; more desktop than laptop  Lots of ports; big screen and roomy keyboard  The Powerful One  Many laptops in this price range offer enough processing oomph for web browsing, Netflixing and Exceling, but not gamer-grade horsepower. Acer Inc.\u2019s Swift 3 does a little better. Its Core i7 processor, more powerful than you\u2019ll often find at this price, makes the machine more suitable for Photoshop users or inveterate tab-hoarders. Just don\u2019t expect it to run \u201cFortnite.\u201d  Acer also added a large selection of ports to the Swift 3 and a relatively large 14-inch display. But all that extra stuff makes it larger and heavier than my other picks. It works as a stashable in-home family PC, but by today\u2019s standards, it isn\u2019t especially mobile.  Lenovo | Yoga 720 $989 Battery Looks Power  Versatility  PROS  CONS  Shallow keyboard; subpar speakers  Light and flexible; often cheapest of the bunch  The Affordable One  Lenovo Group Ltd.\u2019s Yoga 720 has almost everything you\u2019d want in a laptop, and I\u2019ve seen it on sale for as little as $750. Its screen back flips to lie flat against the keyboard so you can hold it like a tablet. It\u2019s fast enough, lasts long enough and looks good enough.  My issues with the Yoga individually feel minor: The speakers sound mushy, the keyboard is a bit shallow, the design is bland. Together, they make clear why the 720 is cheaper than the others: It\u2019s a good computer for the price, but if you spend more on something else, you\u2019ll be glad.  HP | Spectre x360 $999 Battery Looks Power  Versatility  PROS  CONS  Gets dirty easily; uneven keyboard backlight  Clean, attractive look; excellent keyboard  The Best One  If all you want is to stop reading and just buy a new computer, here\u2019s your answer: The best $1,000 Windows computer is HP\u2019s latest Spectre x360, a machine that does everything well. We\u2019ve been recommending this line for a few years now, and HP just keeps improving it.  The x360 checks all the spec boxes, looks as good as anything out of Cupertino, Calif., and is enjoyable to use, from the speakers to the keyboard. It has a 360-degree hinge that flips the laptop into a tablet for drawing or using in a cramped space. It uses new USB-C ports for charging and data, but also offers an older-style standard USB-A port.  In my testing, the x360\u2019s biggest problem has been the lid\u2019s tendency to scuff in my bag. It came in third on my super-harsh battery test, behind the Surface Pro and nearly in line with the Dell: You should have no trouble using it through a workday. It\u2019s not rich with new ideas about what computers can be, but when you have work to do, that isn\u2019t the priority. You just want a laptop, and HP made a terrific one.

AMZN -1.22%  The search-engine operator has plans to build three new underwater fiber-optic cables lining ocean areas from the Pacific to the North Sea, extending its private data network to regions competitors haven\u2019t touched with similar projects.  The cables, expected to be finished in 2019, are designed to speed the transfer of data and reroute users to servers around the globe if a region fails or gets overloaded.  Google said the investments could cost hundreds of millions of dollars but are worth the expense to get a better shot at the multibillion-dollar cloud-computing market.  \u201cI would prefer not to have to be in the cable-building consortium business,\u201d said Ben Treynor, vice president of Google\u2019s cloud platform, but when the company looked at ways to push its cloud business past new frontiers like Australia and South America, \u201cthere weren\u2019t a lot of great options.\u201d  Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOGL -0.12% owns a massive network of fiber-optic cables and data centers built up over the past decade. Mr. Treynor said the infrastructure already adds up to the world\u2019s biggest private network, handling roughly 25% of the world\u2019s internet traffic, and helps Google control its data-intensive software without relying on telecom companies.  The projects would bring the number of subsea cables Google has helped build to 11 after a decade of nonstop construction. Its engineers rely on all those conduits to refresh search results, move video files and serve cloud-computing customers who do business in different parts of the globe.  That last business line could use a boost. Google is third in cloud-computing revenue behind Amazon and Microsoft in the race to win big customers, which run everything from shopping websites to government databases on the tech giants\u2019 computer servers. Billions of dollars of annual revenue are at stake as corporations move their information-technology operations to more flexible systems on the cloud.  Google has teamed up with other firms, including domestic telephone operators and Facebook Inc., to build its subsea cables. But it is breaking precedent with its longest, fully private long-distance cable, which will stretch 6,200 miles from Los Angeles to Chile, where the company finished a data center in 2015.  \u201cThis is, I believe, the largest single pipe into Chile,\u201d Mr. Treynor said of the Curie cable, named after the French scientist Marie Curie.

The Havfrue line, Danish for \u201cmermaid,\u201d will give the company more bandwidth across the Atlantic Ocean.  A planned 2,400-mile cable called HK-G, running from Hong Kong to Guam, will hook up with other cable systems linking Australia, East Asia and North America.  Google\u2019s new cables will help link five new regions for cloud customers in Montreal, the Netherlands, Los Angeles, Finland and Hong Kong.  The company\u2019s network-driven strategy has gained it some attention. PayPal Inc. technology chief Sri Shivananda said the company spent months considering where to move some of its developer and testing systems before settling on Google in mid-2017.  Mr. Shivananda said the payments processor was impressed by Google\u2019s consistently fast connections. Transactions that take too long often make users abandon a purchase entirely, he said.  Some of PayPal\u2019s acquired companies, including Braintree and Venmo, still run partly on Amazon. \u201cWe\u2019ll be a multi-cloud environment\u201d for the foreseeable future, Mr. Shivananda said.  \u2014Jack Nicas contributed to this article.", "stock": "MSFT"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/linkedins-27-billion-challenge-get-people-to-use-it-more-1521201600", "label": -1, "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "date": "2018-03-16", "article": "What\u2019s more, more than half of members, 51%, used LinkedIn every few weeks or less often, Pew found.

At the time of the deal, Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella said one goal was to weave together the tools people use to get their jobs done and professional networks that connect workers.  To achieve that end, LinkedIn needs members such as Mr. Frank to engage more frequently, updating their job titles, contacts, career achievements and more\u2014data crucial to Microsoft\u2019s plans to integrate its expensive acquisition. Microsoft wants to pump that data into artificial-intelligence offerings, business-software services and even its Office productivity tools, such as its Outlook email and calendar programs.  Artificial intelligence could help Microsoft\u2019s Dynamics business play catch-up to Salesforce.com Inc. To that end, Microsoft is using LinkedIn data to help sales representatives target fertile prospects, critical in the so-called customer-relationship management market that Gartner Inc. estimates hit $39.4 billion last year.  Microsoft has started to infuse Office apps with LinkedIn data about contacts, so meeting attendees learn about one another directly from calendar invitations. The company hopes that level of integration will give its venerable franchise a leg up against Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Gmail.  Applying artificial-intelligence algorithms to LinkedIn data could create new revenue opportunities for Microsoft, said Goldman Sachs & Co. analyst Heather Bellini. \u201cThis is a company that has different ways to monetize than it used to,\u201d she said.  LinkedIn is about to roll out a passel of features aimed at drawing people regularly. For the past year, its engineers have worked on Project Agora, revamping everything from the site\u2019s news feed to the service that lets members message one another.  This spring, LinkedIn will add an \u201cinterest panel\u201d to members\u2019 home pages that will include groups they\u2019ve joined and hashtags they\u2019ve followed\u2014features intended to keep members coming back to learn the latest on topics that matter to them. By summer, LinkedIn will add content from groups into news feeds and notify members of such posts. That way, members will see posts that are related to their interests and won\u2019t be put off by posts from connections with whom they have little in common.  Still, it is a steep challenge to get members to carve out more time for the service, particularly if they turn to LinkedIn only when looking for work or seeking out sales leads, said TJ Keitt, a senior analyst at Forrester Research Inc.  \u201cThere are a ton of people that don\u2019t have an immediate need to engage with it,\u201d Mr. Keitt said.  The goal of Project Agora, named after the public meeting spaces in ancient Greece, is to convince members that LinkedIn is also a place to hone professional skills, find mentors and share knowledge to solve business problems.  \u201cWe need to make LinkedIn a place where people talk to one another,\u201d said Kiran Prasad, vice president of LinkedIn Product, who leads the project.  Mr. Prasad recognizes the challenge of changing people\u2019s perceptions of LinkedIn as just a place to look for new job opportunities. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re under an illusion that it\u2019s going to happen on day one,\u201d he said.

Microsoft lawyer Joshua Rosenkranz, left, and Brad Smith, the company\u2019s president and chief legal officer, speaking to reporters Tuesday following oral arguments at the Supreme Court. Photo: Drew Angerer/Getty Images  WASHINGTON\u2014Supreme Court justices voiced concern Tuesday that Microsoft Corp.\u2019s MSFT -0.53% resistance to U.S. search warrants for customer emails stored overseas would hamper criminal investigations, in a case that pits leading tech companies against law enforcement.  During an hourlong oral argument, the court considered whether email providers like Microsoft, Yahoo and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s GOOGL -0.12% Google have to comply with warrants if the government is seeking email messages and other digital files that are stored on computer servers outside the U.S.  Several justices said it wasn\u2019t ideal that the case was controlled by a 1986 federal law on electronic records that Congress adopted before email and cloud-computing were part of the social fabric. Still, the court appeared to be searching for a way to interpret the outdated law that wouldn\u2019t rob the government of tools to investigate crimes with a digital trail that crossed U.S. borders.  \u201cThis is what troubles me,\u201d Justice Samuel Alito said. \u201cIt would be good if Congress enacted legislation that modernized this. But in the interim, something has to be done.\u201d  The justices were reviewing a lower-court ruling Microsoft won in 2016 that clipped the Justice Department\u2019s authority to obtain overseas emails. The battle dates back to 2013 when the U.S. got a warrant that ordered Microsoft to hand over messages in an email account that was linked to narcotics trafficking. Microsoft argued the warrant wasn\u2019t valid because the emails were stored in Ireland.  Microsoft lawyer Joshua Rosenkranz argued the 1986 law, called the Stored Communications Act, didn\u2019t allow the U.S. government \u201cto unilaterally reach into a foreign land to search for, copy, and import private customer correspondence\u201d that is stored on a foreign computer and protected by foreign law.  Chief Justice John Roberts, however, said Microsoft was a U.S.-based company and had control over where it chose to store emails and other consumer data.  Newsletter Sign-up  \u201cIt\u2019s not the government\u2019s fault that it\u2019s located overseas,\u201d the chief justice said. He added that if Microsoft prevailed, nothing would prevent the company from moving the emails of U.S. customers to overseas servers to protect their data from disclosure.  \u201cYou might gain customers if you can assure them, no matter what happens, the government won\u2019t be able to get access to their emails,\u201d Chief Justice Roberts said.  Mr. Rosenkranz said such a scenario \u201cwould never happen\u201d because Microsoft relies upon U.S. facilities to provide the best and fastest service to 200 million domestic customers. People who are intent on hiding their correspondence from the government \u201cdon\u2019t use Microsoft\u2019s services,\u201d he said.  Mr. Rosenkranz also warned the court that a win for the government could do serious harm to the U.S. tech sector. \u201cIf you try to tinker with this without the tools that only Congress has, you are as likely to break the cloud as you are to fix it,\u201d he said.  Google, which has waged similar battles with the government, and an array of other leading tech companies are supporting Microsoft in the case.  Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg suggested the wait-for-Congress approach had some appeal.  \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be wiser just to say, \u2018Let\u2019s leave things as they are\u2014if Congress wants to regulate in this brave new world, it should do it\u2019?\u201d Justice Ginsburg asked.  Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah), who attended the oral argument, recently proposed bipartisan legislation to update the law and give law enforcement access to overseas customer data, while also providing protections for email and cloud computing providers. It isn\u2019t clear if, or when, lawmakers may move forward on such a bill.  No justice during Monday\u2019s session clearly embraced Microsoft\u2019s reading of the 1986 law. Nor did the justices echo concerns about customer privacy that have been voiced by the tech industry.  The government noted that investigators would still have to get a warrant to see the emails.  \u201cIt\u2019s not a case about privacy,\u201d Justice Department lawyer Michael Dreeben told the court. \u201cThe government has the gold standard of an instrument to address privacy interests here\u2014a probable-cause-based warrant issued by a judge that describes with particularity what we want.\u201d  Mr. Dreeben said the lower-court ruling in Microsoft\u2019s favor \u201chas caused grave and immediate harm to the government\u2019s ability to enforce federal criminal law.\u201d  A decision is expected by the end of June.

The major console makers\u2014Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo Co. \u2014have long supported cross-play between their machines and personal computers, and more recently with mobile devices.

Recently, the friends agreed not to buy a new Capcom Co. game, \u201cMonster Hunter: World,\u201d for their consoles. Instead, they are waiting for it to come out for PCs in the fall so they can play together, Mr. Ross said.  People playing the same game on different hardware can link up online, provided the developer has built software to allow the two systems to talk to each other. But the developer would still need each hardware makers\u2019 blessing.

The live stream, which handily beat the previous Twitch record for simultaneous viewers on the channel of an individual broadcaster, occurred days after Epic said it would enable both PlayStation 4 and Xbox users to play against people on PCs and mobile devices\u2014though not against each other.  Epic\u2019s announcement prompted a \u201cFortnite\u201d player on Twitter to implore Phil Spencer, Microsoft\u2019s head of games, to add cross-play with Sony\u2019s console. \u201cWe really want cross-play system between XB1 and PS4,\u201d the tweeter said.  \u201cMe 2,\u201d Mr. Spencer tweeted back minutes later.

Sony demurred.  \u201cIt\u2019s extremely frustrating,\u201d Psyonix Chief Executive Dave Hagewood said.  Game developers have good reason to want cross-play, Benchmark Co. analyst Mike Hickey said. \u201cYou\u2019re less likely to go play another game if your buddies are all playing together,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re more engaged, you\u2019re more likely to spend money\u201d on virtual goodies inside the game, he said.  Prohibiting cross-play can be advantageous for a console maker: Shoppers might be inclined to choose the system that friends own, said Piper Jaffray analyst Mike Olson. That tips the scales in favor of the market leader, which right now is Sony\u2019s PlayStation 4.  Microsoft hasn\u2019t always supported cross-play. In 2011, when its Xbox Live service dominated online console games, a company representative told the website Kotaku that Microsoft wasn\u2019t on board, because it couldn\u2019t guarantee players on competing systems would get the same level of quality as on Xbox 360.

The case, set to be heard next month, stems from a dispute between the Justice Department and Microsoft Corp. over access to emails stored on a server in Ireland. Industry officials say it highlights the stark differences between the U.S. and Europe over views on online privacy and the extent of government access to users\u2019 data.  The U.S. government in 2013 obtained a search warrant requiring Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft to hand over email information as part of an investigation into a customer who allegedly was using the account to conduct criminal drug activity.  Microsoft complied with part of the order but rebuffed the request to turn over the email messages, which were stored abroad, arguing that U.S. search warrants don\u2019t reach data stored outside domestic borders. Microsoft argues that complying with the warrant would have meant the company could have run afoul of EU privacy rules.  At issue in the court case are broader questions about who should govern global internet companies, and how. In particular, cloud computing companies, such as Microsoft or Amazon.com Inc., can move data among different servers around the world.  Microsoft says it stores users\u2019 data in the region where a user resides and customers should be in control of their data.  The U.S. argues that its warrant required Microsoft to hand over the information because it can be accessed in the U.S. with the click of a computer mouse, and lack of access to that data could pose significant barriers to ongoing investigations.  \u201cHundreds if not thousands of investigations of crimes\u2014ranging from terrorism, to child pornography, to fraud\u2014are being or will be hampered by the government\u2019s inability to obtain electronic evidence,\u201d the Justice Department said in a court brief.  A U.S. government win in the case could hand U.S. companies operating in Europe an expensive dilemma: either comply with U.S. data requests or risk breaching EU data privacy rules. European companies with business operations in the U.S. also fear they could receive similar requests from American authorities sent to their headquarters abroad.  \u201cThis untenable position would throw a wrench into the countless routine business arrangements that comprise today\u2019s highly interdependent commercial world,\u201d the largest trade organizations from Germany, Ireland, Poland and France said in a joint filing to the court.  Foreign governments can access evidence in Europe for criminal investigations, but the preferred method under EU law is to go directly through member states, as part of what is known as a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty. That approach will be enshrined in the bloc\u2019s new data protection regulation, to enter into force in May. The new rules threaten fines as high as 4% of a firm\u2019s global revenue for failure to comply.  Washington\u2019s position seems to fly in the face of EU sovereignty, some European officials and legal experts said.  \u201cThis can clearly escalate to being a conflict of law and international relations,\u201d said Jan Philipp Albrecht, a Green Party member of the European Parliament and staunch privacy advocate. \u201cThe question [is] if the EU can expect that their own laws apply to their own territory and market or is the U.S. trying to put that into question?\u201d  Companies, governments and institutions in Europe and elsewhere have submitted third-party briefs to the court ahead of the hearing, which is set for February 27. A decision is expected by June.  The U.K., one of the U.S.\u2019s closest law-enforcement allies in Europe, has thrown its weight behind Washington\u2019s arguments in the case. Britain, which is preparing to exit the EU, is also currently negotiating a bilateral treaty with the U.S. over access for law-enforcement purposes to electronic communications held on servers in each other\u2019s jurisdictions.  The case is reminding some Europeans of leaks by one-time National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden disclosing that U.S. tech companies cooperated with the NSA, allowing authorities to access information through a so-called backdoor. Those revelations sowed deep mistrust in Europe of U.S. intelligence practices, straining trans-Atlantic ties and hindering cooperation between Washington and Brussels in other areas.  U.S. tech companies also came under scrutiny from the broader public following the revelations. That is one reason Microsoft is fighting so hard: to maintain its reputation. Microsoft says it has only provided data to the U.S. government under valid legal orders.  \u201cPre-Snowden, this would have been done quietly, there would have been an accommodation\u201d between Microsoft and the government, said James A. Lewis, a senior vice president at the Center for Strategic & International Studies, a Washington-based think tank. \u201cEveryone would have gone away happy.\u201d  Now, \u201cthey need to show the world, their global customer base, that they\u2019re not just going to roll over every time the U.S. government asks them for something,\u201d he said.

The tax is due regardless of whether they bring it home or not, though companies may choose to pay it over eight years. Businesses must generally book this tax as a one-time charge in the final quarter of 2017. Apple said this month it would pay $38 billion in taxes and return the majority of its overseas cash to the U.S.  The taxes companies pay on these profits will vary somewhat, depending on both the size of the profits and how they have been invested. Companies must pay 15.5% on liquid assets, such as cash and a variety of marketable securities, and 8% on other assets. Technology companies tend to have a larger amount of liquid assets as a share of their overseas stockpile than other industries: For instance, 95% of networking giant Cisco Systems Inc.\u2019s accumulated foreign profit last year was in cash and cash equivalents, versus 22% for retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc.  The Wall Street Journal estimated that 311 large publicly traded companies could generate nearly $250 billion in these taxes, of which 38% could be paid by tech companies.

That means firms like Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Cisco Systems, which over the past decade have paid lower tax rates on average than the new statutory rate of 21%, may soon see their rates go up. International Business Machines Inc., which paid a tax rate of 12% last year excluding one-time benefits, said this month its rate will rise to as much as 18% in 2018.  The five biggest tech companies\u2014 Apple Inc., Alphabet, Microsoft Corp. , Amazon.com Inc. and Facebook Inc. \u2014all report earnings this week and investors will be looking for guidance on tax rates.  Use of capital  Now that companies are free to bring foreign cash to the U.S. at no added cost, they will be dogged with the question of how they plan to spend it. Tech firms are already among the biggest spenders on research and development and on acquisitions. Adding to these budgets may not be the answer.

The Republicans sold the tax overhaul on the promise that it would return investment to the U.S., not to enrich shareholders.  \u201cIt will be interesting to see what companies ultimately do with more unfettered access to their global cash,\u201d said Kirsten Malm, a partner at law firm Baker McKenzie who advises tech firms on taxes. \u201cIs this going to set off a new wave of M&A? Will we see share buybacks? Maybe not, because share prices are so high at the moment.\u201d  Borrowing  With most of their cash sitting offshore, tech giants have increasingly issued debt to finance their growth and return money to shareholders. Tech firms in the S&P 500 collectively held nearly $566 billion in long-term debt in the most recent quarter, more than three times the amount they held just five years ago. That is a faster pace of growth than any other sector.  Racking Up Debt Tech companies acquired debt at a faster pace than any other sector in the S&P 500 over the last five years.

REUTERS/Brian Snyder  IBM\u2019s results call after U.S. markets closed on Thursday forecast an operating profit of at least $13.80 per share for 2018, compared with $13.80 in 2017 and market expectations of $13.92, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  The outlook came on the back of the computing services and hardware firm\u2019s first quarterly revenue growth in six years.  \u201cWhile slight growth is a modest positive, we were largely underwhelmed by IBM\u2019s results, and felt the numbers showed IBM has much more work to do to turn the ship around,\u201d Deutsche Bank analyst Sherri Scribner wrote in a client note.  IBM\u2019s 3.6 percent revenue growth came mostly from a 71 percent jump in sales of its new Z14 mainframe, which was launched in September, and a 27 percent growth in its cloud business.  Several analysts pointed to the traditionally cyclical nature of mainframe revenues, which tend to surge for 2-4 quarters after the launch of a new launch before falling off.  But some said the growth since IBM launched its Z14 in September hinted at a different outcome.  Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty said the new mainframe\u2019s heightened focus on security was attracting more new customers and workloads rather than just upgrades at a time when cyberattacks and chip vulnerability are at the top of buyer\u2019s list of concerns.  A growth in the mainframe business might also improve IBM\u2019s margins. The company\u2019s fourth-quarter adjusted gross margins of 49.5 percent fell short of market expectations of 50.8 percent.  IBM has been moving away from its shrinking hardware and software businesses to what it calls \u201cstrategic imperatives,\u201d which includes the contribution of cloud computing \u2013 where companies use a remote network of data centers instead of their own hardware to cut costs.  Strategic Imperatives grew 14 percent in the quarter.  \u201cLooking under the surface, however, it appears that strategic imperatives excluding Systems only grew 6 percent, largely driven by the lack of Cognitive Solutions growth,\u201d Berenberg analyst Josep Bori said.  \u201cThis is clearly not enough to offset the declining core business,\u201d he said.  IBM said it would continue to \u201cmaintain a high level of investment\u201d in 2018 as it boosts its capabilities on cloud, mobile, cybersecurity and data analytics.  \u201cThis quarter was another important step in the right direction with 2018 a major prove me year for IBM to show the turnaround story is viable, which we believe it is, albeit at a snail-like pace,\u201d GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives said.", "stock": "IBM"}, {"url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-investment-funds-berkshire/berkshire-buys-teva-bites-more-apple-feels-ibm-blues-idUSKCN1FY33P", "label": 1, "source": "reuters", "date": "2018-02-14", "article": "(Reuters) - Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) on Wednesday disclosed a new stake in generic drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (TEVA.TA) and said it bought more shares of Apple Inc (AAPL.O), which surpassed Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) as its largest common stock investment.

REUTERS/Chris Helgren/File Photo  The global shipping industry has seen little innovation since the container was invented in the 1950s, and cross-border trade still leaves an enormous trail of paperwork and bureaucracy.  Success of the platform, which will be made available to the ocean shipping industry around mid-2018, depends on whether Maersk and IBM can convince shippers, freight forwarders, ocean carriers, ports and customs authorities to sign up.  Blockchain technology powers the digital currency bitcoin and enables data sharing across a network of individual computers.  It will help manage and track tens of millions of shipping containers globally by digitizing the supply chain process from end to end, the companies said.  \u201cThe big thing that is missing from this industry to digitize and unleash the potential of the technology is really to create a form of utility that brings standards across the entire ecosystem,\u201d Maersk\u2019s Chief Commercial Officer Vincent Clerc said in an interview.  A shipment of refrigerated goods from East Africa to Europe can go through nearly 30 people and organizations and involve more than 200 different communications, according to Maersk.

Revenue in the newer businesses \u201cmissed whisper expectations,\u201d which disappointed the most bullish scenarios, he said.  IBM reported fourth-quarter sales of $11.1 billion in \u201cstrategic imperatives\u201d -- those newer products and services in cloud, analytics, security and mobile. While that was up 17 percent from a year earlier, it was just in line with the average estimate and many were hoping for more, Ives said.  IBM shares were down 3.3 percent at 7:16 a.m. in pre-market trading in New York Friday.  Much of the growth fueling IBM\u2019s $22.5 billion in fourth-quarter revenue came from its new mainframe servers. Customers from banks to health-care companies are buying the hardware and accompanying software for their own data centers to run large applications -- from financial transactions to customer billing. That should help keep pumping up revenue over the next couple of quarters, analysts said. But IBM will have to show that gains in its newer software and services will help it keep growing even when the bump from hardware sales fades.  \u201cIt\u2019s possible that organic growth may be back to flat in the second half of this year, once the benefit from the mainframe refresh cycle goes away,\u201d said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Anurag Rana. \u201cIf you exclude the contribution from mainframes, growth would be flat to negative, which is in line with the past few quarters.\u201d  Sales, which increased 3.6 percent in the period, topped the average analyst estimate of $22.06 billion. International Business Machines Corp. had forecast the growth in October. IBM said it took a one-time charge of $5.5 billion as a result of the new U.S. tax law, which weighed on profit. In addition, the company said it expects its tax rate to rise in 2018 as a result of the bill, which includes a lower corporate tax rate offset by a broader tax base and reduced foreign tax credit utilization.  Tax Headwinds  The tax headwinds, combined with the one-time charge, threw \u201cone big wrench in the wheel\u201d and could also be why investors are reacting negatively, said David Holt, an analyst at CFRA Research.  Profit, excluding some items, was $5.18 a share in the quarter. Analysts projected $5.17. IBM fell 1 cent short of the average analyst estimate of $13.81 a share for the full year. Under generally accepted accounting principles, IBM reported a loss for the quarter including the tax charge. The shares fell as much as 4.8 percent to $161 in extended trading.  Over the last six years, Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty assured investors that she would refocus IBM\u2019s business on emerging technologies -- such as cloud and artificial intelligence -- and stem the revenue decline. She shed units, invested in cloud data centers and bought a number of companies to boost sales, bolster technology offerings and add troves of data to help train AI algorithms. But those investments have yet to pay off, and analysts have said that IBM\u2019s turnaround is still in the works.  The shares took a beating last year, after the company missed sales estimates in the first half. The stock then rallied the most since 2009 after the company forecast revenue would increase in the fourth quarter. Analysts have said that shows investors care most about getting back to sales growth. One quarter of expansion doesn\u2019t a successful turnaround make, and it\u2019s now critical for IBM to sustain improving revenue this year.  \u201cRevenue growth has been what investors have been wanting to see,\u201d Holt said. \u201cWhen you pull back the layers, all the segments are churning, and fundamentals are pointing in the right direction.\u201d  The company projected revenue growth in 2018, regardless of currency trends. New Chief Financial Officer Jim Kavanaugh said that will be achieved in part by gains in software-as-a-service as well as IBM\u2019s global business services operations -- an area that has struggled in recent years.  Strategic Imperatives Goal  Rometty had set a goal for IBM to reach $40 billion in strategic imperative revenue this year, which would mean those newer products would make up more than half of the company\u2019s business. Kavanaugh said the company will achieve that goal and continue to increase strategic imperative sales at least at a percentage in the the double digits.  Should IBM increase revenue in global business services as promised by the end of the year, that would reverse continuous declines of more than a year, Holt said. This is an area IBM has invested heavily in to shift the focus and skills of its employees onto projects in digital and cloud-based technologies.  Gross margins were 49.5 percent, missing the average analyst estimate of 50.9 percent, in part because measures to cut expenses took longer to pay off, the company said. While margins improved sequentially as promised, this is the ninth straight quarter that they shrank compared with the same period the prior year. Gross margins will stabilize this year, helped by the expense cutting, higher sales in more profitable products and increased scale on the cloud business, Kavanaugh said. However, currency hedges and plans to continue investing will offset some of that benefit, he said.  Revenue from the systems unit, which houses hardware and operating systems software, grew 32 percent. Typically an area of decline, sales of mainframe servers, as well as accompanying software, helped boost the group.  Sales in the cognitive solutions unit, which houses analytics software and the AI products branded under Watson, grew 2.5 percent to $5.4 billion. Technology services and cloud platforms, the unit that includes IBM\u2019s cloud infrastructure and platform offerings as well as its consulting business, posted a revenue decline of 1.2 percent, in part because some of its legacy software sales with bigger upfront revenue shifted to the cloud.  Last week, IBM named Kavanaugh to be the new CFO, while Martin Schroeter will be taking on a new role as the senior vice president of global markets. Kavanaugh has been at IBM for two decades and previously oversaw real estate and chief information officer budgets.", "stock": "IBM"}, {"url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-14/warren-buffett-s-berkshire-cuts-almost-its-entire-stake-in-ibm", "label": 1, "source": "bloomberg", "date": "2018-02-14", "article": "Warren Buffett is just about done with International Business Machines Corp.

And it initiated a new holding in Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., worth about $365 million, in the final three months of last year.  IBM was always a curiosity for Buffett followers. He\u2019d spent years telling them that technology companies were outside his area of expertise then plowed more than $10 billion into the company in 2011.  Flawed Valuation  Back then, Buffett\u2019s investment was a huge vote of confidence for the aging computer-services firm and its leadership. But things soon went south. IBM struggled with declining sales, forcing Buffett to defend the pick. For awhile, he even added some to his holdings.  Last year, however, he\u2019d had enough. Just before Berkshire\u2019s annual meeting in May, he acknowledged that his valuation had been flawed and that he\u2019d begun to cut back on the investment.  Buffett had hinted he might sell additional IBM shares before the end of last year. Since some of the stock traded below his purchase price, it would have been advantageous for Berkshire to recognize a loss when tax rates were higher, he said this January. Berkshire\u2019s stake in the company stood at just 2 million shares at the end of December, which have a market value of about $309 million.  Missed Opportunities  The episode has highlighted just how badly Buffett missed opportunities in tech companies that have come to dominate the ranks of the world\u2019s most valuable enterprises. At the annual meeting, he issued a mea culpa, adding that he \u201cblew it\u201d by failing to invest early in Google despite having plenty of chances to learn about and understand its business model.  In a sign of his new thinking, Buffett plowed billions of dollars into Apple starting in 2016. He added more to that investment in the fourth quarter, boosting Berkshire\u2019s total stake in the iPhone maker by 23 percent to about 165 million shares.  While much smaller, Berkshire\u2019s new investment in Teva may capture investor attention. The drugmaker has lost more than two-thirds of its value in the last two years. New Chief Executive Officer Kare Schultz has been making major changes since taking over in November. He\u2019s told investors to brace for an ugly ride that won\u2019t be over this year, and gave a 2018 earnings forecast far below investors\u2019 expectations.  To clean up some of the company\u2019s more than $30 billion in debt, Schultz said he\u2019ll cut about 25 percent of jobs at the company -- a step that past CEOs have been unwilling to take given Teva\u2019s close ties to its home market in Israel. He\u2019s also reorganized the drugmaker\u2019s management, and said it will eliminate some money-losing products.  After Berkshire\u2019s new holding was disclosed, Teva\u2019s American Depository Receipts surged 8 percent.  Some other notable changes to Berkshire\u2019s portfolio:  The stake in Bank of New York Mellon Corp. climbed 21 percent to 60.8 million shares  The holding in Monsanto Co. rose 32 percent to 11.7 million shares  The holding in American Airlines Group Inc. was lowered by 1 million shares to 46 million.  \u2014 With assistance by Drew Armstrong", "stock": "IBM"}, {"url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-16/siemens-mounts-plan-for-cyberattack-defense-with-airbus-daimler", "label": 0, "source": "bloomberg", "date": "2018-02-16", "article": "Siemens AG is joining with companies including Airbus SE and IBM to try to counter large-scale hacking attacks that threaten to cost $8 trillion in damage over the next five years.  The group signed a charter Friday at a security conference in Munich urging stronger safeguards against assaults on digital systems that control homes, hospitals, factories and nearly all infrastructure. The charter aims to set a standard for companies to find trustworthy business partners, or avoid those outside that circle, Siemens Chief Executive Officer Joe Kaeser said.  \u201cIf companies along the value chain share their experiences, then we can prevent a lot of things,\u201d said Kaeser, who helped initiate the charter. Conversely, \u201cif you haven\u2019t established a certain set of elements, then you\u2019re not part of the it. There has to be a unified approach.\u201d  The initiative comes amid an ongoing investigation in the U.S. into allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 election, and after computer malware has already shown its ability to spread through systems worldwide. Last year\u2019s WannaCry ransomware crippled parts of Britain\u2019s National Health Service and infected more than 300,000 computers across 150 countries. The cost of cyber-crime to firms over the next five years could reach $8 trillion, the World Economic Forum said in a report in January.  Signatories of the Munich charter, which also include Allianz AG, Daimler AG, NXP Semiconductors NV, SGS SA and Deutsche Telekom AG, are calling for governments and companies to take responsibility for digital security at the highest levels. They suggest governments set up dedicated ministries devoted to the issue.  Societal Breakdown    Airbus CEO Tom Enders said his company now employs about 1,000 people dealing with a response to cyber attacks, a number he estimates will rise tenfold or more in the next decade, highlighting how the issue is becoming an increasingly central part of large companies\u2019 organisation. New-generation aircraft contain tens of thousands of sensors and are increasingly connected via mobile networks, making the storage and securing of data increasingly complex, he said.  Still, most of of the security breaches that are disclosed via government agencies to companies typically come from the either the U.S. or the U.K., evidence that other European political institutions must do more to collaborate with companies, Enders said.  \u201cWe must not be afraid to share information freely between governments, government agencies and industries,\u201d Enders said.  Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said the issue \u201c\u2018will certainly be a focus\u201d of the country\u2019s Group of Seven presidency this year.

The Phoenix project was originally chosen by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s Conservative predecessors 10 years ago to centralize the government payroll. International Business Machines Corp. won the contract to install and help run the system, which uses Oracle Corp. software.  It went live in 2016, just months after Trudeau won office. From the beginning, it didn\u2019t work like it was supposed to. Some people were paid too much, others not at all. Those issues snowballed with the deluge of requests to fix incorrect paychecks. The fear of not getting paid still hangs over the country\u2019s more than 260,000 federal public servants. Some put off major financial decisions. Others declined promotions or retirement, fearing any change in their pay could cause more trouble.  Two years later, some employees are still having problems. The latest data showed a backlog of 384,000 cases linked to the program.  IBM said it\u2019s \u201cfulfilling its obligations on the Phoenix contract, and the software is functioning as intended.\u201d The company \u201ccontinues to work in partnership with the government\u2019s efforts to resolve the project\u2019s issues, and remains committed to the project\u2019s overall success,\u201d it said in a statement.  An Oracle representative declined to comment.  Debi Daviau, president of one of the main unions representing government workers, said the blame falls mostly on the senior government officials who ran the project and opened it even though there were glaring warning signs it wasn\u2019t ready. But she also questions why IBM went ahead when it was clear there would be problems, and why the company benefits from a project that never worked as promised.  \u201cThey should have known better,\u201d Daviau said in an interview. When the company\u2019s warnings that more testing was needed went unheeded, IBM didn\u2019t put its foot down and hold up the project until it was ready, she said.  \u201cIBM got into a contract with the government that was very beneficial to IBM, which meant that the contract -- despite non-delivery -- could continue to be extended and IBM could continue to come back to the pot for money,\u201d she said.  Treasury Board President Scott Brison has said IBM has a responsibility to help the government fix the program.  \u201cIBM, as a sophisticated global company, needs to recognize that we as the government of Canada are not just an important client for IBM but there is reputational risk for IBM in not helping us fix this,\u201d Brison said last June during an appearance at the Senate\u2019s finance committee.  The fiasco illustrates how difficult it is to bring governments into the 21st century when it comes to technology, and the risks and limitations faced by companies like IBM, who get a large amount of their business from governments. IBM, based in Armonk, New York, doesn\u2019t disclose how much of its revenue comes from government contracts.  It\u2019s not the first time IBM has been embroiled in a payroll system disaster. The Australian state of Queensland scrapped a similar project after an initial contract went off the rails and ended up costing the government around A$1 billion ($772 million) to fix. A public inquiry mostly blamed government officials, but determined IBM shouldn\u2019t have been chosen for the job. IBM disputed some of the inquiry\u2019s findings in 2013.  Canadian Finance Minister Bill Morneau said Wednesday that the previous government made mistakes in dismissing staff needed to implement Phoenix but that, \u201cit\u2019s not about seeking blame, it\u2019s about trying to get it right.\u201d  Canada announced Tuesday it would start moving away from Phoenix and set aside money to find a new solution. The government will spend C$431 million to keep the program running in the near term, on top of C$460 million already spent to put Phoenix in place and fix the problems it generated.  The project was meant to save costs by firing 1,200 employees handling payroll at various departments around the country and replacing them with about 500 people in a centralized location using Phoenix to handle most of the government\u2019s payroll needs.  An inquiry from Canada\u2019s auditor general, a position similar to the U.S. Government Accountability Office, found many of the new employees were poorly trained and overworked. The software platform itself, a heavily modified version of Oracle\u2019s PeopleSoft program, had yet to be encoded with many of the payroll complexities faced by a massive and diverse public service, such as unique shift rules for Coast Guard officers or prison guards.  Phoenix is a classic example of a government wanting to save money on an expensive new technology project by cutting the number of employees working on it, only to discover later that those people were essential to seeing it through, said Nigel Wallis, a vice president with research firm IDC Canada. Other companies considered the project and decided against bidding because it looked too complex, but IBM went ahead, Wallis said.    \u201cThe promise of short term savings are often illusory,\u201d Wallis said \u201cThat\u2019s a real issue not just for government but also for a lot of large scale technology transformations. You need to approach them with a level of seriousness that I don\u2019t think necessarily was done in this instance.\u201d  Most major technology change-over projects -- for the private and public sectors -- either fail or face significant challenges, according to researcher Standish Group, which tracks thousands of projects every year.  On Wednesday, a New Democratic Party representative stood up in Parliament to ask Trudeau what he was doing for one of her constituents who was out C$40,000.  \u201cWe didn\u2019t create this mess,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cBut we are going to fix it.\u201d  \u2014 With assistance by Josh Wingrove, and Nico Grant", "stock": "IBM"}, {"url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-16/ibm-maersk-form-new-blockchain-company-for-international-cargo", "label": 1, "source": "bloomberg", "date": "2018-01-16", "article": "IBM and A.P.

China\u2019s erstwhile tech darling, which lost its perch atop the PC market to HP Inc. in 2017, has shed two-thirds of its value since hitting a 15-year high in 2015. At a two-year earnings multiple of about 10 times, its stock is cheapest among the world\u2019s largest computer makers. Yet all seven analysts ranked best by Bloomberg based on one-year returns urge investors to sell. Their average target puts Lenovo 13 percent below Tuesday\u2019s close.  From money-hemorrhaging businesses to resurgent competition for its cash-cow PC division and a revolving-door executive team, the company that once aspired to Apple and Samsung\u2019s heights seems to have lost its way. Chief Executive Officer Yang Yuanqing\u2019s failed repeatedly to deliver on turnaround deadlines and hasn\u2019t fully articulated a strategy to revive ailing mobile and datacenter arms -- even as local rivals gun for its bread-and-butter Chinese customer base.

The people asked not to be identified talking about the subject because the company isn\u2019t ready to make an announcement yet.  \u201cLike many new technologies, we have individuals in various teams exploring potential uses of blockchain but it\u2019s way too early for us to speculate about any possible uses or plans,\u201d a Google spokesman said.  In 2016, Google started a trial for developers testing blockchain services on its cloud. The company is now exploring much more expansive ways to deploy the technology, the people said.  Digital ledgers like blockchain power Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. They are databases that are updated regularly across thousands of computers over the internet. Each entry is confirmed by these machines, which can be part of public networks or run privately by companies. There are different kinds of digital ledgers -- blockchain is only one. Data crunched by this technology range from transactions to supply-chain updates to digital cats.  The technology presents challenges and opportunities for Google. Distributed networks of computers that run digital ledgers can eliminate risks that come with information held centrally by a single company. While Google\u2019s security is strong, it\u2019s one of the largest holders of information in the world. The decentralized approach is also beginning to support new online services that compete with Google.  Still, the company is an internet pioneer and has long experience embracing new and open web standards. To build its ledger, Google has looked at technology from the Hyperledger consortium, but it could opt for another type that may be easier to scale to run millions of transactions, one of the people familiar with the situation said.  \"Any time there\u2019s a paradigm shift like this, there\u2019s an opportunity for new giants to emerge -- but also for incumbents to adopt the new approach,\" said Elad Gil, a startup investor who worked on early mobile projects at Google more than a decade ago.  Sridhar Ramaswamy, Google\u2019s advertising chief, said at a recent conference that his division has a \"small team\" looking at blockchain, but noted the existing core technology can\u2019t handle a lot of transactions quickly. Some marketing firms have started to explore blockchain\u2019s potential to facilitate digital ad buying without using Google and Facebook Inc., the two dominant industry players.  When Alphabet wants to keep up with emerging technology, it often backs startups in the field and makes small acquisitions to recruit talent. GV, Alphabet\u2019s venture capital arm, has invested in wallet service Blockchain Luxembourg, financial transactions network Ripple, cryptocurrency asset management platform LedgerX, international payments provider Veem and the now-defunct Buttercoin, according to CB Insights.  Global Blockchain Spending IBM, Microsoft benefit the most from distributed ledger technology Source: WinterGreen Research Inc.  Among tech giants, IBM and Microsoft Corp. have so far led the charge in offering blockchain-related tools and letting companies tinker with digital ledgers using their cloud services. The market for blockchain products and services may grow from $706 million last year to more than $60 billion in 2024, according to WinterGreen Research. Cloud\u2019s 800-pound gorilla, Amazon.com Inc., helps companies build blockchain applications, and Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg is looking at cryptocurrencies, encryption and other decentralized computing approaches.  A slew of startups are trying to challenge Google\u2019s online dominance by using digital ledgers. Brave is a web browser that competes with Google\u2019s Chrome. Instead of running targeted ads, Brave uses blockchain technology to pay websites when people spend time there. BitClave lets people perform searches online, and get rewarded for seeing ads. Another project, Presearch, is also using blockchain to try to compete with Google\u2019s search engine, according to a white paper by the startup.  \"You\u2019re going to see an unbelievable amount of R&D expenditures go into this,\" said Jeff Richards, a managing partner at venture firm GGV Capital. \"Everybody learned from the internet and mobile that you can\u2019t afford to wait.\"  \u2014 With assistance by Joe Mayes", "stock": "IBM"}, {"url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2018-03-07/broadcom-trips-up-in-a-political-minefield-on-qualcomm", "label": 1, "source": "bloomberg", "date": "2018-03-07", "article": "When the U.S. government waves the flag of patriotism and national interest, Broadcom Ltd. tries to wave it even harder.  The company that wants to buy computer-chip maker Qualcomm Inc. got a dose of unwanted news earlier this week. The committee that reviews foreign corporations' acquisitions of American companies wrote an extraordinary letter to Broadcom that said, essentially, that the U.S. government is not inclined to look kindly on a combination of Singapore-based Broadcom and Qualcomm.  Reading between the lines of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., at least some U.S. government officials are worried about the potential for China -- and particularly China's telecom equipment powerhouse Huawei -- to dictate the next generation of mobile internet technology, known as 5G. And the committee is concerned that Broadcom and its cost-cutting reputation won't be a good steward of great American hope Qualcomm, which is expected to play a critical role in the development of 5G and has strong ties to the U.S. government.  The merits of CFIUS's argument are debatable, but it's clear that Broadcom has walked into a political minefield in which the U.S. government's fear of China dominating technology standards is working against it. The company's rebuttal to CFIUS takes all those complicated political ingredients and turns them into clumsy Broadcom Jell-O.  Wrong Direction Broadcom's share price has dipped this year, indicating some investor concerns about the company's proposed Qualcomm takeover Source: Bloomberg  Broadcom pledged in a statement released on Wednesday to \"make the U.S. a global leader in 5G,\" but it was vague about how it would go about it. The company said it would maintain the research-and-development resources that Qualcomm has devoted to 5G and \"focus\" the investment to technologies that \"are essential to the U.S.\" Again, there are few specifics. That fits with Broadcom's inflexibility and vagueness in other aspects of its Qualcomm deal talks, including the uncertainty of antitrust scrutiny.  Broadcom tried to tackle one of the committee's main points by saying the company has a \"proven track record of managing R&D for maximum impact.\" But that's a euphemism for reduced spending, and CFIUS is worried that Broadcom's playbook of slashing spending at companies it acquires would weaken Qualcomm's ability to be on the vanguard of 5G technology. Broadcom most likely couldn't address this point more aggressively because the company is stretching its financial limits in the attempted $100 billion acquisition of Qualcomm and knows it must cut costs to make the deal work.  Broadcom in its letter also pledged to create a $1.5 billion fund to train engineers that would hone America's edge in wireless technology. This has all the hallmarks of companies' typical pledges when they're trying to score political points and perhaps have no plans to follow through.  IBM, also with political goals in mind, announced in late 2016 a $1 billion fund to train American workers in technology areas. If all these announcements come through, America will have the best and most expensive workforce in the world. But they won't. At least Broadcom didn't mention the mysterious $20 billion that President Trump said the company's incorporation in the U.S. would somehow deliver to American cities and workers.  A Penny for Your Thoughts Broadcom gets only a small percentage of its revenue from the U.S. Its 2017 purchase of Brocade will add about $1 billion more in North America revenue. That's still nowhere near $20 billion. Source: Bloomberg  Broadcom also waved its U.S. flag vigorously by saying it's part of the lineage of iconic American technology companies that also includes Hewlett-Packard ... and Brocade (acquired by Broadcom)? Yes, I'm sure every child in Silicon Valley knows the founding history of Broadcom and Brocade. Allow me to suggest substitutions for actually iconic American technology companies: IBM, Apple, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, Google and Facebook.  Maybe Broadcom thinks it can afford to be inept in its dealings with CFIUS because the committee won't matter. In the worst kind of political theater, Broadcom said last year that it planned to shift its official home country from Singapore to the U.S. That pending shift has the advantage of possibly removing CFIUS from the picture because Broadcom won't be a \"foreign\" acquirer anymore.  Broadcom reiterated in its statement on Wednesday that it expects that home country swap to be completed no later than May 6. A Qualcomm shareholder election that is a proxy vote on the Broadcom takeover was delayed until early April because of CFIUS's interest. It's possible Broadcom can string this all this along and hope the apparent antipathy of Qualcomm stockholders toward company management and the board can carry Broadcom to acquisition victory.  Whether this acquisition happens or not, both Qualcomm and Broadcom have been damaged. For Qualcomm, the takeover tussle fueled shareholders who were worried and angry about the company's fights with customers and regulators. Broadcom's acquisition play has exposed the limits of the company's acquire-at-all-costs blueprint and showed the company's tendency to be ham-handed politically when it needs to be adroit.  -- with assistance from Gadfly's Brooke Sutherland  This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.", "stock": "IBM"}, {"url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2018-01-30/lenovo-is-steaming-toward-a-goodwill-iceberg", "label": -1, "source": "bloomberg", "date": "2018-01-30", "article": "Lenovo Group Ltd. has a serious problem on its hands.  It's a problem that could wipe out this year's earnings and even threaten profits next year and beyond.  Despite spending more than $5 billion in a series of acquisitions four years ago, Lenovo's attempts to bolster its mobile and server businesses haven't amounted to much. Its income statement has shown management's flailing attempts to make good on promises, which included wringing a profit out of its new mobile division within six quarters of purchase, and reaching $5 billion in annual sales from its server (aka enterprise) division.  Chronic Fatigue Lenovo's mobile and server businesses haven't made a profit since acquisitions aimed at bolstering both divisions Source: Lenovo, Bloomberg  But investors focusing on Lenovo's P&L may be missing an iceberg on its balance sheet. Lenovo paid massive premiums for the Motorola Mobility smartphone and IBM server businesses in 2014, and the goodwill section of the balance sheet is where these markups sit. This is common, because buyers usually bid up the value of the assets they're pursuing, and you can think of goodwill as the \"overpaid\" column in the spreadsheet. For Lenovo, the result was a sudden doubling to more than $5.2 billion.  Too Good Lenovo's goodwill ballooned after a series of acquisitions that were supposed to boost revenue and profits in its smaller units Source: Bloomberg  Buying assets and booking goodwill isn't a problem if the new divisions add value, usually through profits, or economies of scale that boost margins or cut costs. With the Motorola and IBM acquisitions, though, that clearly wasn't the case. So it's more likely than not that the current fair value of those units is less than the carrying amount Lenovo ascribes to them.  Breaking It Down Half of Lenovo's goodwill sits in divisions that are chronically unprofitable Source: Lenovo, Bloomberg Gadfly, Bloomberg  I choose these words carefully, because \"more likely than not\" is the term the Financial Accounting Standards Board uses to assess whether a goodwill impairment needs to be made. The IFRS Foundation, which also issues financial reporting guidelines, is a little more blunt in its IAS36 standard:  An asset must not be carried in the financial statements at more than the highest amount to be recovered through its use or sale.  Among the indications of impairment, according to the accounting firm Deloitte LLP, is whether the asset returns \"worse economic performance than expected.\"  There's absolutely no doubt, based on management's previous public statements, that those units bought at a cost of $5 billion are performing worse than expected. What's extraordinary is that after four years Lenovo hasn't recognized such impairment and allows the goodwill to sit on the balance sheet.  Reporting standards only require a test of goodwill to be done annually, so it's reasonable not to see anything announced in the past few quarters. But the company's financial year is coming to an end March 31, so the clock is ticking.  You can understand management's reticence. After a slew of deals in the late 2000s, Acer Inc., a Taiwanese PC maker, clung to inflated goodwill figures despite clear signs that the acquisitions weren't bearing fruit. In the end, it had to conduct an IAS36 impairment test and recognized a NT$9.4 billion ($335 million) writedown, enough to plunge Acer into a record annual loss and spur the ousting of its chairman and CEO.  That impairment was equivalent to about 24 percent of Acer's total intangible assets at the time. For Lenovo, I calculate it would take a mere 10.3 percent writedown to push it into a loss for the current fiscal year -- and that's only for an impairment on goodwill, and only at the mobile and server divisions. A deeper, 20 percent impairment on those units would bring about a record annual loss.  Knife Edge It would take only a small impairment of its goodwill to push Lenovo into a full-year loss for the current fiscal year Source: Bloomberg Gadfly  When Lenovo reports third-quarter earnings this week, expect management to focus again on its awesome PC division, and to continue talking up the prospects of the mobile and server units.

Chinese universities and U.S. technology companies, such as International Business Machines Corp. and Microsoft Corp., are racing to develop quantum computers, a type of processing that\u2019s forecast to be so powerful it can transform how drug-makers, agriculture companies and auto manufacturers discover compounds and materials.  Quantum computing uses the movement of subatomic particles to process data in amounts that modern computers can\u2019t handle.

While overall spending by China is unknown, its government is building a $10 billion National Laboratory for Quantum Information Sciences in Hefei, Anhui Province, which is slated to open in 2020. U.S.-funded research in quantum is about $200 million a year, according to a July 2016 government report, and some researchers and companies don\u2019t believe that\u2019s enough.

What\u2019s Intellectual Property and Does China Steal It?: QuickTake  U.S. President Donald Trump accused the Chinese government in March of stealing intellectual property by forcing American companies to share their most valuable secrets and sign joint venture agreements with local firms if they want to operate in China, although there are no specific allegations regarding quantum computers.  Peter Navarro, the White House trade adviser, spoke Sunday on NBC\u2019s \"Meet the Press\" about the tariffs before shifting to intellectual property.  \"What is at stake here,\" he said, \"is the industries of the future. Artificial intelligence, robotics, quantum computing. And what\u2019s at stake is not just our economic prosperity. If I may, it\u2019s also our national security. Because many of these industries of the future have profound military implications.\"  China\u2019s Innovation  China has also been aggressive in pushing home-grown innovation as it supports companies in obtaining patents and trademarks around the world, and has increased its research funding. In its annual scorecard, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development called China \u201cthe second largest scientific powerhouse,\u201d behind the U.S.  Read More: Who Is Building Canada\u2019s Quantum Brain Trust?  Technology companies from Microsoft to IBM to Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google view quantum computing as the next revolution.  \u201cOver time, quantum in the field of computation is so important is that it will redefine the category of computers themselves,\u201d said Dario Gil, vice president of IBM\u2019s Artificial Intelligence research. \u201cIt is the future of computing.\u201d  IBM\u2019s inventions may be having the most impact on the nascent field, when judged by the number of times its research has been cited by others in their patent applications. The Armonk, New York-based company already has developed computers being tested by customers, including Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, the Energy Department\u2019s biggest lab, as well as finance companies like JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Barclays Plc, Gil said.  \u2018Tough Problems\u2019  Intel Corp., which started its own program two years ago, said the technology promises to be \u201ctransformational.\u201d  \u201cThere are many tough problems to solve before quantum computing is a commercial reality,\u201d said Jim Clarke, director of quantum hardware at Intel. \u201cSome of these problems involve materials science, quantum chip design and manufacturing -- those are sweet-spot problems for Intel.\u201d  Clarke said Intel is competitive in the number of patents it\u2019s seeking, though many aren\u2019t yet public. Applications are made public after 18 months.  IBM Makes Breakthrough in Race to Commercialize Quantum Computers  While there will still be a place for what\u2019s being called \u201cclassical computers\u201d -- a category that includes modern smartphones and even super computers -- the quantum computers could have \u201can infinite number of applications\u201d in the fields of life sciences, chemistry and agriculture, said IBM\u2019s Gil.  \u2018Patent the Potential\u2019  It\u2019s too early to say which company or country will be the leader in quantum computers, though at this stage it looks like U.S. companies will excel in hardware while Chinese and Japanese ones are focused on the software and applications, Patinformatics\u2019 Trippe said.  \u201cJapanese and Chinese companies aren\u2019t as concerned about building them as they are about how they\u2019ll be used,\u201d Trippe said. \u201cThey\u2019ve started to patent the potential. The next five years are going to be pretty fascinating.\u201d  The U.S. China Economic and Security Review Commission, created by Congress in 2000 to assess national security implications of bilateral trade between the countries, said in its most recent report that China \u201chas closed the technological gap\u201d with the U.S. in quantum information science, a sector Americans have long dominated, \u201cdue to a concerted strategy by the Chinese government and inconsistent and unstable levels of R&D funding and limited government coordination by the United States.\u201d  Quantum Physics  Studies by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Bloomberg have independently shown that China is rising in its overall score for innovation, which includes education, government research and the number of patents. The World Intellectual Property Organization reported March 21 that China is closing in on the U.S. in filing international patent applications.  Quantum physics is one area in which the Chinese government, through its Ministry of Science and Technology, is beefing up its technological prowess, according to a report by the U.S. Trade Representative that laid the groundwork for Trump\u2019s tariff plans. The China Academy of Sciences and Beijing University are among the Chinese research firms seeking more patents on quantum information technology, according to Patinformatics.  The Chinese government invested by giving a lot of money to companies and researchers to \u201creplicate what we did in the U.S. and elsewhere,\u201d said Carl J. Williams, deputy director of the Physical Measurement Laboratory at the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology. \u201cThey\u2019ve come a long ways.\u201d  Encryption Focus  The Chinese researchers are focused on encryption, based on their patent applications. In August 2016, China\u2019s state news agency said the government had launched the world\u2019s first quantum communications satellite, and a year later claimed to have sent the first \u201cunbreakable\u201d code from space.  \u201cThat should be very scary,\u201d said Jonathan Dowling, co-director of Louisiana State University\u2019s Hearne Institute for Theoretical Physics, \u201cat least to the intelligence agencies.\u201d  In the U.S., the Department of Energy, Naval Research Lab and defense contractor Northrop Grumman Corp. are among the government entities or contractors researching quantum computers. Overall, though, the U.S. government has cut back on its own funding of computing and cryptography hardware, Dowling said.  \u2018Considered a Priority\u2019  A July 2016 report by the National Science and Technology Council under former President Barack Obama recommended it be \u201cconsidered a priority for federal coordination and investment.\u201d  In the coming age of quantum, it\u2019s an open question whether federal funding will enable the U.S to maintain the edge it\u2019s had during the PC era and smartphone wars. Scott Crowder, IBM\u2019s chief technology officer for quantum computing, told a House panel in October that \u201cthe U.S. government investment in driving this critical technology is not sufficient to stay competitive.\u201d  LSU\u2019s Dowling said it could mean the U.S. comes out the loser in the quantum race.  \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is a bunch of different things going on at once with no overall organization,\u201d LSU\u2019s Dowling said, \u201cunlike in China, where they are exactly sure what they\u2019re doing.\u201d  \u2014 With assistance by Dina Bass, Jeremy Kahn, and Ian King", "stock": "IBM"}, {"url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/ibm-stock-price-slides-despite-breaking-22-quarters-of-declining-revenue-2018-1", "label": -1, "source": "business-insider", "date": "2018-01-19", "article": "Thomson Reuters  Shares of IBM fell in pre-market trading despite an earnings beat.

IBM's results call after U.S. markets closed on Thursday forecast an operating profit of at least $13.80 per share for 2018, compared with $13.80 in 2017 and market expectations of $13.92, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  The outlook came on the back of the computing services and hardware firm's first quarterly revenue growth in six years.  \"While slight growth is a modest positive, we were largely underwhelmed by IBM's results, and felt the numbers showed IBM has much more work to do to turn the ship around,\" Deutsche Bank analyst Sherri Scribner wrote in a client note.  IBM's 3.6 percent revenue growth came mostly from a 71 percent jump in sales of its new Z14 mainframe, which was launched in September, and a 27 percent growth in its cloud business.  Several analysts pointed to the traditionally cyclical nature of mainframe revenues, which tend to surge for 2-4 quarters after the launch of a new launch before falling off.  But some said the growth since IBM launched its Z14 in September hinted at a different outcome.  Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty said the new mainframe's heightened focus on security was attracting more new customers and workloads rather than just upgrades at a time when cyberattacks and chip vulnerability are at the top of buyer's list of concerns.  A growth in the mainframe business might also improve IBM's margins. The company's fourth-quarter adjusted gross margins of 49.5 percent fell short of market expectations of 50.8 percent.  IBM has been moving away from its shrinking hardware and software businesses to what it calls \"strategic imperatives,\" which includes the contribution of cloud computing - where companies use a remote network of data centers instead of their own hardware to cut costs.  Strategic Imperatives grew 14 percent in the quarter.  \"Looking under the surface, however, it appears that strategic imperatives excluding Systems only grew 6 percent, largely driven by the lack of Cognitive Solutions growth,\" Berenberg analyst Josep Bori said.  \"This is clearly not enough to offset the declining core business,\" he said.

Youtube  At a congressional hearing this week, Jerry Cuomo, IBM's vice president of blockchain technology, testified about the potential governmental uses for blockchains.  Identification documents, payment systems, and systems that trace the movement of foods and drugs, are among the most promising initial governmental applications for the technology, Cuomo said.  Lawmakers were wowed by how much quicker blockchain technology has made the process of tracking down food products.  IBM wants to get Uncle Sam on a blockchain.  The digital ledger technology that underlies bitcoin is ready to be used for everything from paying taxes to tracking food and drug shipments to newer, more secure identification cards, said Jerry Cuomo, vice president of blockchain technology at IBM, at a hearing Wednesday organized by the Congressional Blockchain Caucus.  \"There is an opportunity for the United States to build upon its momentum to lead blockchain by doing,\" Cuomo said in his testimony. \"We should focus our efforts on projects that can positively impact US economic competitiveness, citizens, and businesses.\"  Cuomo encouraged lawmakers to focus on incorporating blockchain technology into already established governmental projects and programs, rather than trying to start new blockchain-themed initiatives. That could help speed its use and adoption and help the US stay at the forefront of blockchain development, he said.  Government agencies at both the federal and state level are already experimenting with the technology. Some states are developing blockchain-based drivers licenses and identification cards. Meanwhile, IBM is working with the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on some blockchain projects, including one that could speed the CDC's ability to develop new drugs.  Right now, drug development involves lots of paperwork. Blockchain technology could help improve the process by putting all of the important information related to drug development in an easily accessible and secure place online.  Developing new drugs \"doesn't just take a long time because people are slow,\" Cuomo said. \"The processes are extremely paper intensive. I see these groups taking the right first steps.\"  In an interview with Business Insider, Cuomo predicted that blockchain-based digital identities will be the first big project to take off at the federal level, because officials can build off the work going on in the states.  In addition to Cuomo, Frank Yiannas, vice president of food safety at Walmart, also testified at the hearing, talking about how his company is using blockchain technology. The retail giant has teamed up with IBM to develop a blockchain designed to track the movement of produce from farmers through distributors and stores to consumers.

Now, IBM wants to change that perception with the launch of its latest additions to its Z-series machines, the IBM z14 Model ZR1, that\u2019s basically a standard 19-inch server rack. With its single-frame design, this new mainframe easily fits into any standard cloud data center or private cloud environment. In addition to the new z14, IBM is also launching an update to the similarly sized Rockhopper server.  In many ways, the new z14 ZR1 is the successor of the company\u2019s entry-level z13s mainframe (though, I guess we can argue over the fact whether any mainframe is really \u2018entry-level\u2019 to begin with). IBM says the new z14 offers 10 percent more capacity and twice the memory (a whopping 8 terabyte) of its predecessor and that it can handle more than 850 million fully encrypted transactions per day on a single system (though IBM didn\u2019t go into details as to what kind of transactions we\u2019re talking about here.  \u201cThis will bring the power of the IBM Z to an even broader center of clients seeking robust security with pervasive encryption, machine learning, cloud capabilities and powerful analytics,\u201dsaid Ross Mauri, general manager of IBM Z, in today\u2019s announcement. \u201cNot only does this increase security and capability in on-premises and hybrid cloud environments for clients, we also will deploy the new systems in our IBM public cloud data centers as we focus on enhancing security and performance for increasingly intensive data loads.\u201d  Mainframes, it\u2019s worth noting, may not be the sexiest computing segment out there, but they remain a solid business for IBM and even in the age of microservices, plenty of companies, especially in the financial services industry, are still betting on these high-powered machines. According to IBM, 44 of the top 50 banks and 90 percent of the largest airlines use its Z-series mainframes today. Unlike its gigantuous predecessors, today\u2019s mainframes don\u2019t need special cooling or energy supplies and these days, they happily run Linux and all of your standard software, too.  In addition to the ZR1, IBM also today launched the LinuxONE Rockhopper II, a more traditional Linux server that also fits into a single-frame 19-inch rack. The new Rockhopper now also support up to 8 terabytes of memory and can handle up to 330,000 Docker containers. While the ZR1 is for companies that want to update their current mainframes, the Rockhopper II is clearly geared toward companies that have started to rethink their software architecture with modern DevOps practices in mind.", "stock": "IBM"}, {"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/03/22/ibm-cant-stop-milking-the-watson-brand/", "label": -1, "source": "techcrunch", "date": "2018-03-22", "article": "More than seven years after IBM Watson beat a couple of human Jeopardy! champions, the company has continued to make hay with the brand. Watson, at its core, is simply an artificial intelligence engine and while that\u2019s not trivial by any means, neither is it the personified intelligence that their TV commercials would have the less technically savvy believe.  These commercials contribute to this unrealistic idea that humans can talk to machines in this natural fashion. You\u2019ve probably seen some. They show this symbol talking to humans in a robotic voice explaining its capabilities. Some of the humans include Bob Dylan, Serena Williams and Stephen King.  In spite of devices like Alexa and Google Home, we certainly don\u2019t have machines giving us detailed explanations, at least not yet.  IBM would probably be better served aiming its commercials at the enterprises it sells to, rather than the general public, who may be impressed by a talking box having a conversation with a star. However, those of us who have at least some understanding of the capabilities of such tech, and those who buy it, don\u2019t need such bells and whistles. We need much more practical applications. While chatting with Serena Williams about competitiveness may be entertaining, it isn\u2019t really driving home the actual value proposition of this tech for business.  The trouble with using Watson as a catch-all phrase is that it reduces the authenticity of the core technology behind it. It\u2019s not as though IBM is alone in trying to personify its AI though. We\u2019ve seen the same thing from Salesforce with Einstein, Microsoft with Cortana and Adobe with Sensei. It seems that these large companies can\u2019t deliver artificial intelligence without hiding it behind a brand.  The thing is this though, this is not a consumer device like the Amazon Echo or Google Home. It\u2019s a set of technologies like deep learning, computer vision and natural language processing, but that\u2019s hard to sell, so these companies try to put a brand on it like it\u2019s a single entity.  Just this week, at the IBM Think Conference in Las Vegas, we saw a slew of announcements from IBM that took on the Watson brand. That included Watson Studio, Watson Knowledge Catalog, Watson Data Kits and Watson Assistant. While they were at it, they also announced they were beefing up their partnership Apple with \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 Watson and Apple Core ML. (Do you have anything without quite so much Watson in it?)  Marketers gonna market and there is little we can do, but when you overplay your brand, you may be doing your company more harm than good.

Some of these are basic insights like alerting you to the fact that your web server security certificate is about to expire while other features go deeper and alert ops teams of emerging threats that IBM is seeing in its global network and that might affect your application and its data. The tool is also sophisticated enough to ensure that developers who have to stick to certain regulations for managing data don\u2019t accidentally load data from a PCI or HIPAA compliant service and then write it to one that isn\u2019t compliant.  The Cloud Security Advisor, which is officially still an experimental product, takes all of this data and presents it in a single dashboard.

Execs from Google, IBM and Salesforce were questioned about the wider societal implications of their technologies during a panel session here at Mobile World Congress.  Behshad Behzadi, who leads the engineering teams working on Google\u2019s eponymously named AI voice assistant, claimed many jobs will be \u201ccomplemented\u201d by AI, with AI technologies making it \u201ceasier\u201d for humans to carry out tasks.  \u201cFor sure there is some shift in the jobs. There\u2019s lots of jobs which will [be created which don\u2019t exist today]. Think about flight attendant jobs before there was planes and commercial flights. No one could really predict that this job will appear. So there are jobs which will be appearing of that type that are related to the AI,\u201d he said.  \u201cI think the topic is a super important topic. How jobs and AI is related \u2014 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s one company or one country which can solve it alone. It\u2019s all together we could think about this topic,\u201d he added. \u201cBut it\u2019s really an opportunity, it\u2019s not a threat.\u201d  \u201cFrom IBM\u2019s perspective we firmly believe that every profession will be impacted by AI. There\u2019s no question. We also believe that there will be more jobs created,\u201d chimed in Bob Lord, IBM\u2019s chief digital officer. \u201cWe also believe that there\u2019ll be more jobs created.  \u201cI firmly believe that augmenting someone\u2019s intelligence is going to get rid of\u2026 the mundane jobs. And allow us to rise up a level. That we haven\u2019t been able to do before and solve some really, really hard problems.\u201d  Though Lord at least mentioned the conjoined need for retraining to ensure that existing employees and workforces are not left behind the blistering march of technology.  \u201cIn every profession, no one is going to be untouched by [AI]. Even when you talk about the creative world, we\u2019re working with music producers right now to be their creative muse, to help them write songs, hit songs,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any profession in the world that will not be hit by artificial intelligence in the coming years.\u201d  The question of how to pay for mass retraining and upskilling programs necessary for the workers whose mundane jobs are handed to robots went undiscussed.  Salesforce\u2019s John Carney, SVP for telecoms & the media industry, was also keen to spin the accelerating AI-powered shift towards increasing automation as a job creation opportunity. But he conceded it could be a threat to even white collar workers who do not pro-actively upskill and get to grips with using AI-enabled tools to intelligently augment their labor.  \u201cIf you look back in history with these paradigm shifts, these transitions, the data says that we created way more jobs than were eliminated,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I think that\u2019s going to happen again. There is going to be a transition. There\u2019s going to be a need for education, there\u2019s going to be a need to \u2014 especially people like me, my age \u2014 to try to work in this new world.\u201d  \u201cSo I think it\u2019s incumbent on both of us, both the folks that are educating, and the folks that need to be open to lifelong learning,\u201d he continued. \u201cI would say that AI\u2019s going to change all of our jobs \u2014 mostly in a positive way. And I would say that I don\u2019t believe AI is going to eliminate managers and the things that we do.  \u201cBut I will tell you that I think managers who use AI are going to have an advantage over managers that don\u2019t use AI. So I want everyone to get out there and start playing with this. And start experimenting.\u201d  World Economic Forum session moderator, Isabelle Mauro, also asked for the panel\u2019s thoughts on governance policies and how lawmakers can find a model to manage increasingly complex algorithmic technologies \u2014 and indeed the increasingly powerful tech giants which are applying AI at scale, powered by their big data holdings.  Google\u2019s Behzadi stayed quiet on this question. But Salesforce\u2019s Carney spoke up to voice concern about the risk of bias in data sets used to train AIs carrying over and into problematic automated decisions.  \u201cTransparency into how these algorithms are generating these predictions \u2014 that\u2019s really important,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s easy to do.  \u201cBecause there can be bias built into these models and you\u2019ve got to let people see how these decisions and these predictions are being made. So there\u2019s work to do.\u201d  \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s just an AI question. It\u2019s a data ownership question as well,\u201d added IBM\u2019s Lord, advocating plainly for education rather than regulation \u2014 albeit, again, without discussing how the necessary re-skilling programs could be funded.  Instead he discussed children he\u2019s met around the world who he said are keen to learn coding and already expressing curiosity about AI technologies.  He then asked for an IBM video clip to be screened which featured a 12-year-old girl saying she\u2019s more interest in learning coding than learning other languages \u201clike French and Spanish\u201d \u2014 apparently unaware of how tone deaf such a suggestion might appear to an audience comprised of people from around the world and taking place in a Catalan-speaking region of Spain.  It was left to Mauro to quip nervously that it\u2019s \u201cvery scary\u201d if children see no point in learning French to a French speaker like her.  \u201cThere\u2019s a wave of innovation that\u2019s going to come\u2026 that there\u2019s no way we\u2019re going to be able to control. We just have to educate people about being responsible for it,\u201d added Lord, pitching the notion that the rise of automation is both inevitable and all but uncontrollable. \u201cThere\u2019s always good with bad, right. You have to always stay on the side of good.  \u201cI think to regulate something like this, you couldn\u2019t regulate Moore\u2019s Law. You couldn\u2019t regulate Metcalfe\u2019s Law. We\u2019re at the same epicenter around AI.\u201d  The panel session ended with a handful of questions taken from the audience \u2014 sourced via Slido.com. The question submitted by your TechCrunch correspondent received the most votes, and Mauro selected it as the first of the audience asks she put to the panel.  Our question being: What happens to privacy when AI is tracking everything?  Lord jumped in first on this, claiming IBM\u2019s position on privacy is \u201cpretty strong\u201d because it\u2019s operating \u201cin an opt-in world\u201d.  \u201cThere has to be a sense that you as the consumer opt in to use your data in an interesting way. I think it\u2019s for a brand to use your data responsibly,\u201d he said, describing how he\u2019s happy to give Starbucks his data because the coffee company gives him something he values (\u201cgood coffee\u201d).  \u201cSo the permission base of, \u2018I will give you so much data about me so you can use AI and you can use analytics to provide with an increased value exchange\u2019, that\u2019s where you\u2019re going to get that value.  \u201cBut clearly we\u2019re not using AI in any situation to track people that don\u2019t want to be tracked. Or behaviors or doing that in ways that don\u2019t make any sense.\u201d  Google\u2019s Behzadi didn\u2019t sit this one out \u2014 taking the opportunity to make an impromptu demo of Google\u2019s voice assistant by asking how his favorite football team are doing, which in turn revealed the AI knows who his favorite team is without him having to literally name the team.  The implication being that users are willing to trade a portion of their privacy for that kind of incremental convenience. Although he conceded that control of which data gets shared is an important balancing consideration for algorithm builders.  \u201cMy [AI] assistant knows what my favorite team is \u2014 I don\u2019t want to necessarily repeat that each time. The same way that I want to say how\u2019s the traffic to home and work. So you have to \u2014 there\u2019s certain types of information that I do want to share with the assistant but of course we need to always try to have the possibility to say that these types of information you don\u2019t want [to be tracked] because it\u2019s \u2014 because privacy [gets] addressed first,\u201d he said, arguing that concerns about privacy can be balanced if you give users enough control over what aspects of their lives your technology tracks.  \u201cOne general principle around privacy is to have, really, users to be in control. It\u2019s not necessarily something new for AI, it\u2019s also for all the other types of data-based algorithms which we had already before. So as long as we try to always make sure that people are in control of what\u2019s being used, potentially, and what\u2019s not and what is the benefit of the data that I\u2019m sharing.\u201d", "stock": "IBM"}, {"url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/02/27/ibm-watson-cto-rob-high-on-bias-and-other-challenges-in-machine-learning/", "label": -1, "source": "techcrunch", "date": "2018-02-27", "article": "For IBM Watson CTO Rob High, the biggest technological challenge in machine learning right now is figuring out how to train models with less data. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge, it\u2019s a goal and there\u2019s certainly reason to believe that it\u2019s possible,\u201d High told me during an interview at the annual Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.  With this, he echoes similar statements all across the industry. Google\u2019s AI chief John Giannandrea, for example, also recently listed this as one of the main challenges the search giant\u2019s machine learning groups are trying to tackle. Typically, machine learning models need to be trained on large amounts of data to ensure that they are accurate, but for many problems, that large data set simply doesn\u2019t exist.  High, however, believes this is a solvable problem. Why? \u201cBecause humans do it. We have a data point,\u201d he said. One thing to keep in mind is that even when we see that evidenced in what humans are doing, you have to recognize it\u2019s not just that session, it\u2019s not just that moment that is informing how humans learn. We bring all of this context to the table.\u201d For High, it\u2019s this context that\u2019ll make possible training models with less data, as well as recent advances in transfer learning, that is, the ability to take one trained model and then use this data to kickstart the training of another model where less data may exist.  The challenges for AI \u2014 and especially conversational AI \u2014 go beyond that, though. \u201cOn the other end is really trying to understand how better to interact with humans in ways that they would find natural and that are influential to their thinking,\u201d says High. \u201cHumans are influenced by not just the words that they exchange but also by how we encase those words in vocalizations, inflection, intonation, cadence, temper, facial expression, arm and hand gestures.\u201d High doesn\u2019t think an AI necessarily needs to mimic these in some kind of anthropomorphic form, but maybe in some other form like visual cues on a device.  At the same time, most AI systems also still need to get better at understanding the intent of a question and how that relates to individuals\u2019 previous questions about something, as well as their current state of mind and personality.  That brings up another question, though. Many of these machine learning models that are in use right now are inherently biased because of the data with which they were trained. That often means that a given model will work great for you if you\u2019re a white male but then fails black women, for example. \u201cFirst of all, I think that there\u2019s two sides to that equation. One is, there may be aggregate bias to this data and we have to be sensitive to that and force ourselves to consider data that broadens the cultural and demographic aspects of the people it represents,\u201d said High. \u201cThe flip side of that, though, is that you actually want aggregate bias in these kind of systems over personal bias.\u201d  As an example, High cited work IBM did with the Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. IBM and the hospital trained a model based on the work of some of the best cancer surgeons. \u201cBut Sloan Kettering has a particular philosophy about how to do medicine. So that philosophy is embodied in their biases. It\u2019s their institutional biases, it\u2019s their brand.

Teams at Google, Microsoft, Intel, IBM and various startups and academic labs are racing to become the first to achieve quantum supremacy \u2014 that is, the point where a quantum computer can run certain algorithms faster than a classical computer ever could.  Today, Google said that it believes that Bristlecone, its latest quantum processor, can put it on a path to reach quantum supremacy in the future. The purpose of Bristlecone, Google says, it to provide its researchers with a testbed \u201cfor research into system error rates and scalability of our qubit technology, as well as applications in quantum simulation, optimization, and machine learning.\u201d  One of the major issues that all quantum computers have to contend with is error rates. Quantum computers typically run at extremely low temperatures (we\u2019re talking millikelvins here) and are shielded from the environment because today\u2019s quantum bits are still highly unstable and any noise can lead to errors.  Because of this, the qubits in modern quantum processors (the quantum computing versions of traditional bits) aren\u2019t really single qubits but often a combination of numerous bits to help account for potential errors. Another limited factor right now is that most of these systems can only preserve their state for under 100 microseconds.  The systems that Google previously demonstrated showed an error rate of one percent for readout, 0.1 percent for single-qubit and 0.6 percent for two-qubit gates.  Every Bristlecone chip features 72 qubits. The general assumption in the industry is that it will take 49 qubits to achieve quantum supremacy, but Google also cautions that a quantum computer isn\u2019t just about qubits. \u201cOperating a device such as Bristlecone at low system error requires harmony between a full stack of technology ranging from software and control electronics to the processor itself,\u201d the team writes today. \u201cGetting this right requires careful systems engineering over several iterations.\u201d  Google\u2019s announcement today will put some new pressure on other teams that are also working on building functional quantum computers. What\u2019s interesting about the current state of the industry is that everybody is taking different approaches.  Microsoft is currently a bit behind in that its team hasn\u2019t actually produced a qubit yet, but once it does, its approach \u2014 which is very different from Google\u2019s \u2014 could quickly lead to a 49 qubit machine.

The general idea here, which is similar to that of competing services, is to enabled a wider range of businesses to make user of recent advances in machine learning by lowering the barrier of entry.  With these new tools, developers can develop their models with the same open source frameworks they are likely already using (think TensorFlow, Caffe, PyTorch, Keras etc.). Indeed, IBM\u2019s new service essentially offers these tools as cloud-native services and developers can use a standard Rest API to train their models with the resources they want \u2014 or within the budget they have. For this service, which offers both a command-line interface, Python library or interactive user interface, that means developers get the option to choose between different Nvidia GPUs, for example.  The idea of a managed environment for deep learning isn\u2019t necessarily new, With the Azure ML Studio, Microsoft offers a highly graphical experience for building ML models, too, after all.

But in its earnings call with analysts today, the company revealed it\u2019s pulling in a billion dollars a quarter in combined cloud revenue. That\u2019s a figure that Google\u2019s Diane Greene says already puts her company on elite footing, but which is substantially below what competitors have been reporting.  \u201cWe are saying we crossed a billion a quarter in 2017 and according to publicly available numbers, we are the fastest growing cloud. If you step back and think about someone offering services and that\u2019s revenue, that\u2019s pretty darn impressive. Not too many companies can make a claim like that. It already puts you in the elite of companies,\u201d Greene told TechCrunch.  It\u2019s worth noting that in Q4, Canalys reported that Microsoft had grown the fastest with 98 percent growth with Google second at 85 percent growth; still quite brisk, but not the fastest. While Greene wouldn\u2019t share specific data on how they came up with their number, she did say the company compared a range of publicly available data with their own internal numbers to come up with the \u201cfastest growing cloud\u201d label.  That may be so, but it\u2019s hard to ignore that a $4 billion run rate is not even equal to a quarter of revenue for any of Google\u2019s main cloud competitors. While it\u2019s hard to do a pure comparison of cloud revenue because there is no standard way of measuring it, we do know that Amazon reported AWS revenue today of $4.331 billion. Meanwhile, Microsoft passed a $20 billion total cloud run rate last year and IBM reported revenue of $17 billion in total cloud revenue for the year in its most recent earnings report, which breaks down to more than $4.25 billion a quarter.  In spite of this, John Dinsdale of Synergy Research, a firm that has been tracking the cloud market for some time says the number did not surprise him. \u201cAbsolutely no surprise on the $1B disclosure and it\u2019s in line with the size and trend of Google\u2019s cloud business that we have been reporting for a long time.\u201d Dinsdale told TechCrunch.  For her part, Greene sees progress. Besides the the rapid growth she cited, Google Cloud has passed major milestones like 4 million customers paying for G Suite and it has tripled the number of sales of a million dollars or more since 2016. All progress, she says, that points to a company that\u2019s growing more quickly than the billion-dollar revenue number would suggest in isolation.  Google has spent $30 billion in infrastructure investments over the last three years to build its data center presence around the world. It also has made a concerted effort to be a more developer-friendly cloud vendor and has contributed key software like Kubernetes to open source, a technology that surged in popularity in 2017.  Greene says this has removed a lot of market obstacles for Google, but that it takes some time for revenue to catch up with customers. \u201cThink about how the cloud works and they start moving over and the revenue takes awhile to start coming in,\u201d she explained.  She cited a long list of big-name customers who have come on board during her tenure, from enterprise technology players Salesforce, Cisco and SAP to a range of other industries, including Disney, Rolls Royce and PayPal.  It\u2019s also worth pointing out that customers don\u2019t typically choose a single cloud vendor, which means that each one can share the same customer.

At the core of both technologies is the cryptographically secure digital ledger known as the blockchain. It\u2019s a digital ledger where cryptocurrency transactions are recorded chronologically and publicly. Indeed, as the popularity of cryptocurrencies has grown, so has the banking industry\u2019s interest in blockchain for fintech, with an increased and focused push on bank-backed blockchain projects.  Some of the largest projects underway include the IBM-backed Hyperledger Fabric project, the Utility Settlement Coin, and R3\u2019s blockchain consortium, signifying a growing acceptance in institutional policy to support blockchain growth  How does it work?  Currently, banks transact with each other by creating agreements, as one would when purchasing an item from a store. A common example would be a bank agreeing to purchase a specific amount of stock for a specific cash price from another. This process, often cumbersome and slow, takes up to several days and incurs the risk that one party may default or renege on the agreement. This period of time, known as settlement, is such an issue that an Oliver Wyman report identified it as costing the financial industry anywhere from $65-$80 billion a year.  Blockchain projects have the potential to reduce, and possibly eliminate, settlement times due to their digital nature, ensuring the timely and secure processing of these operations. Other uses for bank-backed blockchain projects would include secured global currency exchange rate speeds and increased transaction security, among other benefits, eventually allowing for an overhaul of the banking industry, replacing traditional back-office clearinghouses and other outdated mediums that exist between asset sellers and buyers.  IBM\u2019s Hyperledger Fabric  The IBM-backed Hyperledger Fabric project is a trade finance platform aimed at international payments utilizing blockchain, with seven of its largest supporters including Deutsche Bank, HSBC, KBC, Natixis, Rabobank, Societe Generale and Unicredit. IBM\u2019s blockchain platform will run through the IBM Cloud, allowing for interconnectivity between all parties in a particular secure transaction.  This project is designed to be highly scalable, allowing for multiple entrants to easily integrate into the entire financial supply chain process through the secure blockchain, allowing for an unprecedented amount of transaction transparency. In mid-October, IBM revealed a partnership with blockchain startup Stellar, spreading the influence of the Hyperledger Fabric project to global levels unseen before.  The Utility Settlement Coin  Six of the world\u2019s largest banks, Barclays, CIBC, Credit Suisse, HSBC, MUFG, and State Street, have announced backing of the UBS and Clearmatics-spearheaded Utility Settlement Coin, joining other industry heavyweights who have already pledged their support for the project, including BNY Mellon, Deutsche Bank, and Santander.  The UTC specifically tackles the use of blockchain technologies by traditional banks, utilizing it as a tool for more efficient transactions. Additionally, the UTC addresses the issue of currency backing, with the UTC being backed by cash at a central bank, preventing default and credit risk. These safeguards play a huge role in why the UTC has so much pledged interest, allowing banks to take part in the relatively young digital currency ecosystem. The UTC is definitely a sign of fintech adoption in the banking industry, ensuring the eventual wide-scale use of blockchain technologies on a standardized level across the globe.  R3  Blockchain consortium R3 is another player in the bank-based blockchain space, raising $107 million in May, with four of its backers being Temasek, SBI Group, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, and Intel, with further support pledged from industry heavyweights such as Wells Fargo and ING. One of R3\u2019s primary projects has been the development of their Corda platform, with future plans for an infrastructure network specifically geared toward financial institutions to build their own ledger-based applications and services, implying that these banks currently have and will grow their own teams of blockchain developers. R3 is also focused on governmental acceptance of blockchain, with buy-in from these institutions signifying a drastic shift in terms of governmental compliance and usage of such fintech.  By presenting credible potential resolutions of current-day issues, these projects represent large-scale efforts by the banking industry to fully embrace and integrate blockchain into their current infrastructures.

The AT&T-IBM collaboration involves breaking down programs into cloud-based building blocks of code called microservices, each of which handles a certain task.

Most of this business software uses cloud technology that runs inside AT&T data centers \u2014 in a so-called private cloud, in contrast to a public cloud in which computing services are delivered from remote data centers owned by another company. Many corporations opt for private clouds to house their most sensitive customer and business data.  \u201cFor certain parts of our business, IBM was the ideal partner,\u201d Mr. Saxena said.  IBM emphasizes its hybrid stance in the cloud market, offering both private and public cloud technology to its corporate clients. In its financial reporting, IBM also includes all the hardware, software and services it sells to companies to build private clouds in its total cloud revenue, which would put it on a par with Amazon.  Most industry analysts focus on the public cloud market, assuming it will grow faster as companies build fewer data centers themselves. In the public cloud market, IBM has revenue of about $2 billion a year, growing at 30 percent, according to the most recent estimate by IDC. By contrast, Amazon generates more than $12 billion a year and Microsoft about $6.5 billion.  Yet for IBM, its underlying cloud software is crucial to building a big A.I. business with Watson. \u201cIBM has a strong set of assets in A.I.,\u201d said Ed Anderson, an analyst at Gartner. \u201cAnd cloud is the answer to getting Watson in the hands of developers.\u201d  Photo  That was the appeal for Opentopic, a start-up that uses A.I. technology to mine online and corporate data for marketing insights.

If others are leaders in the underlying cloud layers, why not focus higher up and distribute its leading-edge technology on other clouds as well?  IBM says its Watson software, for example, is fine-tuned down to the chip level for the IBM cloud.

Today, facial recognition software is being deployed by companies in various ways, including to help target product pitches based on social media profile pictures. But companies are also experimenting with face identification and other A.I. technology as an ingredient in automated decisions with higher stakes like hiring and lending.  Researchers at the Georgetown Law School estimated that 117 million American adults are in face recognition networks used by law enforcement \u2014 and that African Americans were most likely to be singled out, because they were disproportionately represented in mug-shot databases.  Facial recognition technology is lightly regulated so far.  \u201cThis is the right time to be addressing how these A.I. systems work and where they fail \u2014 to make them socially accountable,\u201d said Suresh Venkatasubramanian, a professor of computer science at the University of Utah.  Until now, there was anecdotal evidence of computer vision miscues, and occasionally in ways that suggested discrimination. In 2015, for example, Google had to apologize after its image-recognition photo app initially labeled African Americans as \u201cgorillas.\u201d  Sorelle Friedler, a computer scientist at Haverford College and a reviewing editor on Ms. Buolamwini\u2019s research paper, said experts had long suspected that facial recognition software performed differently on different populations.  \u201cBut this is the first work I\u2019m aware of that shows that empirically,\u201d Ms. Friedler said.  Ms. Buolamwini, a young African-American computer scientist, experienced the bias of facial recognition firsthand. When she was an undergraduate at the Georgia Institute of Technology, programs would work well on her white friends, she said, but not recognize her face at all. She figured it was a flaw that would surely be fixed before long.  Photo  But a few years later, after joining the M.I.T. Media Lab, she ran into the missing-face problem again. Only when she put on a white mask did the software recognize hers as a face.

Now 28 and a doctoral student, after studying as a Rhodes scholar and a Fulbright fellow, she is an advocate in the new field of \u201calgorithmic accountability,\u201d which seeks to make automated decisions more transparent, explainable and fair.  Her short TED Talk on coded bias has been viewed more than 940,000 times, and she founded the Algorithmic Justice League, a project to raise awareness of the issue.  In her newly published paper, which will be presented at a conference this month, Ms. Buolamwini studied the performance of three leading face recognition systems \u2014 by Microsoft, IBM and Megvii of China \u2014 by classifying how well they could guess the gender of people with different skin tones. These companies were selected because they offered gender classification features in their facial analysis software \u2014 and their code was publicly available for testing.

To test the commercial systems, Ms. Buolamwini built a data set of 1,270 faces, using faces of lawmakers from countries with a high percentage of women in office. The sources included three African nations with predominantly dark-skinned populations, and three Nordic countries with mainly light-skinned residents.  The African and Nordic faces were scored according to a six-point labeling system used by dermatologists to classify skin types. The medical classifications were determined to be more objective and precise than race.  Then, each company\u2019s software was tested on the curated data, crafted for gender balance and a range of skin tones. The results varied somewhat. Microsoft\u2019s error rate for darker-skinned women was 21 percent, while IBM\u2019s and Megvii\u2019s rates were nearly 35 percent. They all had error rates below 1 percent for light-skinned males.  Ms. Buolamwini shared the research results with each of the companies.

But the White House has boasted that its targeting of China\u2019s trade practices has broad support from industries on the losing end of the Chinese approach.  That theory could make it more difficult for American companies to operate in a country that already puts up steep barriers.  American companies and business groups have frequently complained that China blocks off valuable markets from American competition, including technology, media and finance, and that it does so in violation of commitments it made when it joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. China has imposed regulations that require American companies to share their technology with Chinese partners, for example, mandating that foreign companies operate through joint ventures if they want access to Chinese consumers. At times, the Chinese have resorted to stealing vital technologies through cyberwarfare, according to United States authorities.  Late last month, the White House said it would crack down on that behavior, outlining a series of actions aimed at punishing China for its trade barriers.  As Mr. Trump advances a series of tough trade measures to confront these behaviors, however, cracks have appeared in American industry\u2019s seemingly united front.

Any American company that wants to be a global player cannot afford to lose access to China\u2019s growing market, executives say.  Photo  Technology companies argue that the restrictive measures the administration is taking to help protect them could end up penalizing American manufacturing, raising costs and making their companies less competitive globally. And industries most vulnerable to retaliation, like agriculture, are protesting about losing valuable export opportunities. While the Chinese did not target soybeans in their initial tariffs list, many in the soybean industry worry they will be penalized in a trade dispute given China\u2019s importance as a market for exports.  The 25 percent tariff on pork that China imposed on Monday is expected to be particularly harmful, including in regions that supported the president, like Iowa, North Carolina and Indiana. Last year, American farmers sent more than a billion dollars\u2019 worth of pork to China, their largest export market by value after Japan and Mexico.  \u201cBecause we\u2019re so blessed to have America feed the world, we\u2019re also the first industry to get slammed whenever there are trade difficulties between the U.S. and other countries,\u201d Denise Bode, the coordinator for the American Fruit and Vegetable Processors and Growers Coalition.

These new tariffs are a drag on their ability to make ends meet.\u201d  Since Mr. Trump announced the China measures on March 22, American officials, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and the United States trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, have been in talks with the Chinese about ways to resolve their differences. The sides have discussed concessions like reducing China\u2019s tariffs on American cars, opening up its market for financial services and purchasing more semiconductors or natural gas, people familiar with the talks said.  However, analysts and companies involved in China said that these measures appeared unlikely to adequately resolve American concerns about China\u2019s longstanding encroachment on American intellectual property.  Companies are waiting anxiously for the administration to release a list of Chinese products this week that will be subject to tariffs \u2014 most likely the kind of high-tech products that the administration has accused China of targeting. The retail industry, which lobbied the administration and Congress against an early plan to impose tariffs on Chinese-made apparel and footwear, is now cautiously optimistic that its products will be exempt.  Restrictions on Chinese investment are expected to follow in the coming weeks. Administration officials have said those rules will aim to restore reciprocity with the Chinese, though it is not clear if the United States will go so far as to bar Chinese companies from investing in the same industries that China restricts. The White House is also considering the use of an emergency economy powers act that could allow it to restrict Chinese investments.

Last month, the committee stalled a hostile takeover of Qualcomm, a California-based chip maker, by a Singapore company, largely over concerns about ceding semiconductor prowess to China.  G.E. and IBM, which operate through joint ventures and other partnerships in China and around the world, have both lobbied against the expansion of Cfius over concerns that restrictions on joint ventures with foreign companies that include the transfer of valuable skills or technology could weaken the position of American companies abroad.  Financial firms, including Goldman Sachs and the Carlyle Group, have also expressed concern about investment restrictions, saying they could provide a drag on the United States economy.

The simple grading system used by restaurant regulators can and should be a model to inform the public about the digital security of businesses that store sensitive consumer data. A letter grade is a crude measure to assess a complex issue like cybersecurity to be sure, but what the metric lacks in nuance it makes up for with brute force.  Current measures to assess cyber-preparedness are either not compulsory or too complex. The federal government\u2019s National Institute of Standards and Technology framework is widely respected, but it\u2019s voluntary, underused and not easily digestible for the average consumer. Only seven Fortune 500 companies mentioned it in their annual filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission last year, and only one said it had adopted it.  MSCI \u2014 an index provider and independent research firm for institutional investors \u2014 ranks companies on cybersecurity. More than a year before Equifax\u2019s breach was revealed, MSCI scored Equifax a 0 out of 10 on privacy and data security. As prescient as it was, consumers would have had difficulty absorbing such a rating, which is just one of several components that MSCI uses to arrive at an environmental, social and governance, or E.S.G., rating of overall corporate citizenship.  A new grading system should start with the basics: Are companies on top of data security, and if hacked, do they know how to reduce the impact?  Each year, the Ponemon Institute, an independent research group, and IBM look at the cost of the average data security breach, as well as the average cost of each piece of data compromised. In 2017, the average cost of a data breach in the United States was $7.35 million, or $141 per record compromised. But if a company has an incident response team, uses encryption, trains its employees, has a business continuity program and monitors cyber-threat intelligence, that reduces the cost of the average data breach by nearly 47 percent. Using these five factors \u2014 weighed for their impact of cost reduction \u2014 is a simple starting point.  There are plenty of details to be worked out about a cybersecurity grading system. But the one nonnegotiable aspect would be that, once assigned, letter grades must be made highly accessible to the public. Companies should be required to display their grades prominently at their physical locations, on their websites, on certain documents (mortgage applications, for example) and on credit card readers.

Before he died in 2016, she said, Mr. Grove encouraged her to follow her dream of a chip start-up \u2014 a plan with parallels to the 1968 founding of Intel as a breakaway from a chip pioneer, Fairchild Semiconductor.  \u201cHe said, \u2018I just want you to know, this is a really hard job,\u2019\u201d Ms. James recalled. \u201cI said: \u2018I know. But it\u2019s so much fun.\u2019\u201d  Her venture is the latest in a series of largely unsuccessful attempts, dating back more than seven years, to shake up the server market with technology licensed by ARM Holdings that is used as a mainstay of smartphones. One selling point is reduced power consumption, a hot topic in data centers.  Ampere\u2019s underlying technology originated at Applied Micro Circuits, which built three generations of ARM-based server chips. The Silicon Valley company was acquired in early 2017 by Macom Technology Solutions, which in October agreed to sell the business to what is now Ampere. Essentially all of Applied Micro\u2019s 300-person development team joined the new venture, Ms. James said.  She declined to disclose how much Carlyle was investing but said Ampere was well funded. It has recruited Intel veterans and other engineers and completed its first chip, which is available in sample quantities, she said. The start-up is based not far from Intel\u2019s headquarters.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Ampere won\u2019t lack for competition. Besides Intel, a longtime rival, Advanced Micro Devices, has a new line of server chips that have landed some customers. Qualcomm, the biggest mobile chip maker, unveiled an ARM-based server chip in November. Marvell Technology and Cavium, which have agreed to merge, also sell ARM server chips.  Ms. James sounds undaunted. She said Ampere\u2019s chips topped rival products on price, speedy connections to retrieve data from memory and other features. More broadly, she said, the market has changed because of advances in software, manufacturing technology and renewed investor interest in start-ups pursuing specialties such as machine learning.  \u201cThere's a lot of excitement around silicon again,\u201d she said.", "stock": "IBM"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/business/what-is-cfius.html", "label": 1, "source": "the-new-york-times", "date": "2018-03-05", "article": "The committee\u2019s findings, which are not publicly announced, are sent to the president, who may suspend or prohibit the deal.

Japanese companies were at the forefront of the electronics industry then, and Reagan administration officials mustered intense pressure to force Fairchild to cancel the deal (it later struck a deal with National Semiconductor). But the threat of more Japanese investment led Congress to pass the Exon-Florio Amendment in 1988, granting the president the ability to stop a foreign acquisition if there is \u201ccredible evidence\u201d that a \u201cforeign interest exercising control might take action that threatens to impair the national security.\u201d  Cfius was empowered with reviewing mergers for potential threats.  China is a frequent element in the deals Cfius reviews  Cfius reviews deals across a variety of industries and companies from dozens of different countries. It has often set its sites on deals involving Chinese companies, as the country\u2019s economic might has grown in recent years. From 2013 to 2015, the latest years for which the committee has made data public, about 20 percent of the deals that Cfius reviewed involved investors from China.  Among the notable recent reviews were:  MONEYGRAM \u2014 ANT FINANCIAL Ant Financial, a Chinese electronic payments company, wanted to purchase MoneyGram, a money transfer company based in Dallas, for $1.2 billion. But the deal collapsed in January after both sides said Cfius refused to approve it. The collapse came despite a charm offensive by Jack Ma, the Chinese tycoon who controls Ant Financial, who had visited President-elect Donald Trump at Trump Tower and pledged to create one million American jobs. But he could not overcome the Trump administration\u2019s concerns about Chinese acquisition of American know-how. CANYON BRIDGE CAPITAL \u2014 LATTICE Canyon Bridge Capital, a private equity firm, wanted to acquire Lattice, a chip maker based in Portland, Ore. Canyon Bridge received investment from a group that included China Venture Capital Fund Corporation, which is owned by Chinese government-backed organizations. Lattice said Cfius objected to the deal, and the company tried to appeal to the president, offering to resolve national security concerns. But Mr. Trump formally blocked the deal in September 2017, prompting China\u2019s commerce ministry to issue a statement saying countries should not push protectionism through security reviews. GO SCALE \u2014 PHILIPS In 2015, the Dutch electronics giant Philips had an agreement to sell a controlling stake in its automotive and LED business for as much as $2.9 billion to GO Scale, an investment fund sponsored by GSR Ventures of China and Oak Investment Partners. Philips canceled the deal after it could not resolve Cfius\u2019s concerns, and in December 2016 announced it would sell the unit to Apollo Global Management for $1.5 billion, almost half the amount of the earlier deal.  The Broadcom-Qualcomm deal does not involve China-based companies. But there has been concern that the acquisition could undermine the ability of the United States to compete with China in the race for telecommunications supremacy. Members of Cfius pointed to Broadcom\u2019s statements that it would take a \u201c\u2018private equity\u2019-style\u201d approach if it acquired Qualcomm, suggesting to the committee that Broadcom could reduce long-term investment on research and development in favor of focusing on short-term profits.  While the United States has remained a standard-bearer in mobile technology, the committee noted, \u201cChina would likely compete robustly to fill any void left by Qualcomm as a result of this hostile takeover.\u201d  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Lawmakers want to expand Cfius\u2019s jurisdiction  A bipartisan group in Congress has proposed legislation that would greatly expand the number of deals reviewed by Cfius. In November, Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, and Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, introduced a bill that could add thousands of companies with foreign ties to the list of those reviewed each year by Cfius and provide more funding to deal with that increase. A similar House bill was also introduced by Representative Robert Pittenger, Republican of North Carolina. The measure would expand Cfius\u2019s jurisdiction to include joint ventures, sales of minority stakes and real estate deals for property near military bases and other sensitive facilities.  \u201cBy exploiting gaps in the existing Cfius review process,\u201d said Mr. Cornyn, \u201cpotential adversaries, such as China, have been effectively degrading our country\u2019s military technological edge by acquiring, and otherwise investing in U.S. companies.\u201d  The proposal has drawn objections from some businesses.

But it is not the only risk. The new tariffs will inflict damage on the American economy even absent retaliation from abroad. If history is any guide, Mr. Trump is proposing to protect the homeland by shooting it in the foot.  The closest parallel is the moment in 2002 when President George W. Bush decided that, for the umpteenth time, domestic steel makers deserved a hand and imposed tariffs of 8 to 30 percent on a variety of steel products from many countries.  Imports from the affected countries plummeted, of course. But others \u2014 in steel categories not covered by the safeguard and from excluded countries protected by preferential deals \u2014 surged. Overall steel imports increased 3 percent over the next 12 months. Employment in the American steel industry kept declining. And according to one study, by the time the tariffs were lifted in 2003, higher steel prices had cost 200,000 jobs in steel-using companies, more than all the jobs in the steel industry itself.  Undeterred, President Barack Obama did roughly the same thing. After complaints about surging imports, he put tariffs on Chinese tires. Presumably nobody told him that American tire makers no longer produced the kind of low-grade tires exported by the Chinese. In any event, imports from other countries jumped 20 percent after the tariff was imposed. And the price of all imported tires rose by 18 percent, on average.  Gary Clyde Hufbauer and Sean Lowry at the Peterson Institute for International Economics calculated the additional cost to consumers at $1.1 billion \u2014 or about $900,000 per tire job saved. But the wages of workers whose jobs were saved amounted to about 5 percent of that.  The lesson is not that protectionism is porous. It is. And it can be gamed. Until a few years ago, Ford attached rear seats and rear windows to the Transit Connect vans it imported from its plant in Turkey. Once they had gone through customs \u2014 paying the 2.5 percent tariff on passenger vehicles instead of the heftier 25 percent levied on commercial vans \u2014 the seats and windows were ripped out and recycled.  The critical takeaway is that the distortions brought about by trade barriers impose a cost on the economy. It might not be easy to spot before the fact, but it tends to be more substantial than whatever fleeting gains protectionism can bring about to the protected.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Think of the multifiber agreement, which until its demise at the end of 2004 allowed the United States to impose individual quotas on thousands of pieces of apparel \u2014 cotton diapers from China, trousers from Guatemala. The rationale was to protect one of the lowest-wage industries in the country from lower wages in the developing world. A study by the United States International Trade Commission cited by the Dartmouth economist Douglas A. Irwin in his 2002 book, \u201cFree Trade Under Fire,\u201d concluded that it had raised apparel prices by 18 to 24 percent, imposing a particular burden on poor households.

A 63 percent tariff on advanced flat-panel screens for laptop computers in 1991 helped drive a stake through the heart of the American laptop industry itself. Japan\u2019s Toshiba stopped making laptops in the United States. Apple moved production to Ireland. An IBM spokesman called the decision \u201can eviction notice from the U.S. government to the fastest-growing part of the U.S. computer industry.\u201d  Similarly, the ring of protection around the sugar industry almost killed it instead. Hoping to protect a price floor for sugar of 16.75 cents a pound even as world prices sank, in the 1980s Washington resorted to increasingly stringent import quotas that drove domestic sugar prices up to five times the world average.  Clever Canadian firms sent sugary cake mixes to the United States \u2014 where the sugar was extracted. Other countries grabbed on to the tactic. In 1985, Washington put emergency quotas on all imports of sweetened cocoa, cake mixes and edible preparations. South Korean noodles \u2014 with 0.002 percent sugar content \u2014 were snagged in the dragnet. So was kosher pizza from Israel.  Then the unthinkable happened: Coke and Pepsi decided to replace expensive sugar with much cheaper high-fructose corn syrup. From 1980 to 1987, the share of sugar in American sweetener consumption, previously 65 percent, dropped to 47 percent.  \u201cIn the longer term, this market reaction to the sugar program may indeed threaten the economic viability of the entire sugar industry in the United States,\u201d the economist Anne O. Krueger noted in an analysis of the sugar supports.  Sugar quotas are still around, nonetheless. Candy makers including Hershey and Ferrara have moved factories offshore. In 2006, the International Trade Administration concluded that for each sugar growing and harvesting job saved between 1997 and 2002, three confectionary manufacturing jobs were lost.  Sugar quotas even undermined American policy to counter narcotics trafficking. The Central Intelligence Agency concluded that falling sugar exports encouraged farmers in Jamaica and Belize to switch to marijuana.  Mr. Trump might look back fondly at that long-ago chicken tax. In the 1980s, Detroit did everything it could to fend off Japanese automakers. It persuaded the Reagan administration to force the Japanese into \u201cvoluntary\u201d export restraints on cars \u2014 raising car prices for American consumers.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Nothing was as successful as the chicken wall. It eroded over time. S.U.V.s were ultimately allowed into the United States as cars. Japanese automakers started making monster pickups and S.U.V.s in the United States, too. Still, fewer than a quarter of cars sold in the United States are made in America. The share for light trucks is 54 percent.  But there was a cost: more expensive pickup trucks, for starters, not to mention the discarded seats and windows from Ford\u2019s Transit Connects. The tariff also successfully kept smaller, low-margin trucks from competing with the less-efficient models made at home. Alongside low gasoline prices and easy fuel-economy standards, Detroit\u2019s love affair with trucks arguably gave the United States the least fuel-efficient fleet in the industrial world.  If gasoline prices were to rise \u2014 say, in an effort to combat climate change \u2014 a gas-guzzling domestic auto industry could prove a weak link in the nation\u2019s security.", "stock": "IBM"}, {"url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/why-going-serverless-can-set-your-developers-free", "label": -1, "source": "techradar", "date": "2018-03-30", "article": "As a relatively new, and potentially less well-known architecture, serverless might require some defining. Indeed, three years ago, this whole area of technology did not exist.  Serverless means, from a developer\u2019s point of view, that there is no need to setup or manage server infrastructure running your applications.  This doesn\u2019t mean that servers aren\u2019t involved of course \u2013 they are, but with serverless computing developers are shielded from various server management decisions and capacity planning decisions.  Without having to factor servers into their task load or having the burden of managing and maintaining an infrastructure, developers can focus on what they do best.  What\u2019s more - in the past, they have had to learn how to configure many different services and frameworks including apache, nginx, postfix or php \u2013 just to a name a few.  Now, serverless has liberated developers by allowing them to focus on coding in the languages they best understand. The net effect is that developers have more time to focus on innovation, instead of managing the servers that run their code.  Speed, ease & cost efficiency  So, how is this new tech paradigm being applied? Generally speaking, due to the fact that serverless is relatively new, it lends itself to modern cloud native or microservice applications as opposed to legacy apps. Serverless computing is most suited to low-performance computing workloads due to the limits on resource imposed by cloud providers.  A particularly compelling use case for serverless is for building APIs due to increased speed. APIs are the software intermediaries that allow two applications to talk to each other. With serverless, developers can build APIs without having to manage any back-end infrastructure. If you\u2019re a front end java script developer for example, now you can build an API much quicker as you don\u2019t have to focus on lower level infrastructure operations and understand multiple coding languages.  In addition to developing APIs more quickly and easily, the use cases for serverless computing extends to traffic flow. APIs might get busy every day, but the peaks can be hard to predict. Let\u2019s take the example of a ticketing company \u2013 they will need to cope with huge spikes in traffic when a new show is announced. They will not necessarily need this level of server capacity at all times, but will still need to be prepared for it. With serverless, greater cost efficiency can be achieved as you only pay when requests are coming in and when your code is running.  For start-ups & for large scale enterprises  With lower upfront costs, serverless is great for start-ups \u2013 because they only really start paying when they begin to get traffic. Beyond start-ups, enterprises of any size that are looking to develop APIs will find that the benefits are clear \u2013 not only is serverless better value for money, it is quick, easy to use, and doesn\u2019t involve taking on a huge amount of risk.  Software developers SiteSpirit are a good example of how serverless architecture can help solve a business challenge by optimising processes. SiteSpirit helps clients create picture-perfect marketing material with a serverless media-library-as-a-service. In highly visual industries such as travel and real estate, marketers need quick and easy access to the right images to design compelling campaigns. With this cloud based service, the pain of storing, tagging, retrieving and manipulating thousands of images is removed \u2014and is built on a serverless architecture to keep costs low.  Open-source platforms open up innovation  However, concerns remain around proprietary lock-in as code written and deployed in the cloud becomes inextricably linked with the cloud provider at that point in time. This means that applications become optimised for a specific cloud environment, and moving cloud provider could sacrifice performance and responsiveness of an application. This is why many developers are now looking to open source solutions.  Deploying this kind of higher order tool, as opposed to running numerous functions that run in parallel will be crucial to optimising time spent on actual coding and building game-changing technology in the cloud.  Serverless: Serving the developer community  As serverless architectures are improved and the parameters are broadened, they are likely to become increasingly popular with developers looking to save time, reduce costs and focus on what they do best.  Within a couple of years, serverless is likely to become a default mode for the development of cloud-based technologies, liberating developers from back-end infrastructure maintenance and opening up programming to the many not the few.  In this way, serverless has the potential to provide a whole new way of working for developers; one in which innovation is at the fore.  James Thomas is a developer advocate for IBM Cloud.

It\u2019ll cost less than 10 cents to produce these grain-sized computers but, obviously enough, they aren\u2019t something you\u2019ll be running Microsoft Word on.

At the heart of these digital currencies is the technology of the blockchain, which dates back to 2008. This is distributed ledger tech that provides a decentralized and transparent method for transactions, while maintaining a high level of security.  To date, the most successful application of the blockchain has been in cryptocurrency. However, this same technology will certainly make itself felt across a variety of other sectors \u2013 which should brace themselves for the impending disruption. In this article, we\u2019re highlighting 10 such arenas that will certainly feel the impact of the blockchain\u2026  Check out how Microsoft is making a blockchain that\u2019s fit for business  1. Voting  A limitation to modern elections is that they require the voter to be physically present at the polling booth to cast their vote, which can often make things awkward in terms of finding the time to travel \u2013 and makes little sense in our mobile, connected society. Another bone of contention is the possibility of voter fraud, with losing candidates potentially engaging in legal battles which can delay the result, and even cost the taxpayer when it comes to conducting a recount.  The application of blockchain technology could eliminate voter fraud, providing a clear record of the votes cast, and preventing any chance of a rigged election. Furthermore, this could all be done on a mobile platform, allowing busy individuals the opportunity to cast their vote without going to a polling station. Follow My Vote promises an \u2018online voting solution for the modern age\u2019 via blockchain technology.  2. Healthcare  While healthcare has mostly moved on from paper-based records, it\u2019s still an industry which is ripe for modernization via the blockchain. Current challenges in this sector include keeping patient records private from hackers, while allowing authorized access by providers.  Applying blockchain technology to healthcare records promises improved data security, with better access for healthcare professionals and patients alike, and greater transparency for healthcare transactions. Gem has partnered with healthcare tech firm Philips in this space.  3. Photography  Photographers can face challenges when it comes to getting paid royalties for their snaps, especially in our digital world where image theft is often just a click away.  With that in mind, at the recent CES show in Las Vegas, Kodak revealed its new digital currency, KODAKCoin, which is backed by a blockchain ledger and image rights platform called KODAKOne. Kodak hopes that the new virtual currency will help protect digital image rights for photographers, allowing them to securely register their work.  4. Internet of Things (IoT)  The IoT promises an ever-growing number of online devices to monitor and contribute to our connected lifestyle. But a significant barrier to the adoption of various smart gadgets is the walled ecosystems which some manufacturers insist upon, locking out devices from other vendors, and generally making things harder for the consumer looking to use a variety of different bits of hardware.  In 2015, IBM and Samsung showed off an application of the blockchain known as ADEPT (Autonomous Decentralized Peer-to-Peer Telemetry), which is designed to decentralize the IoT, and allow devices to communicate directly, without a manufacturer\u2019s hub getting in the way and trying to lock users into a particular ecosystem.  5. Cloud storage  Storing data in the cloud has become an increasingly popular and convenient practice, although it still has potential problems \u2013 like downtime and losing access to your data temporarily, or more seriously, the cloud service being hacked.  Storj is a company that\u2019s using the blockchain for open source cloud storage. Users are connected via blockchain and peer-to-peer technology, with a distributed network to store their data on. Folks with spare storage can also rent it out for income via the Storj app, as the storage space is crowd-sourced.  6. Public records  Our governments are entrusted to store a wide variety of information about individual citizens, including a lot of sensitive material such as financial data on tax returns or property records. Much of this information still exists only in paper form, or in siloed databases, and managing this data can be complicated, as it must be available, without error, and protected from hacking and manipulation.  The use of the blockchain represents an innovative solution to encode this data in a digital ledger, keeping the info safe from being altered. In the US, Delaware-based Ubitquity has the first blockchain-based system (currently in alpha) for property record management including titles, which is in testing overseas at the Land Records Bureau in Brazil.  7. Banking  Financial institutions continue to face challenges with identity theft, cost efficiency of transactions, and just general security. The blockchain will certainly digitally disrupt this industry, and holds the potential key to faster transactions, at less cost, and with a higher degree of security. IBM has partnered with Axoni and R3 to develop and deploy distributed ledger technology to the financial industry.  8. Car leasing  Leasing a car can end up being a protracted process, with multiple parties involved in the transaction, all needing to verify information before the car rolls off the lot. DocuSign, which specializes in secure digital documents, has partnered with credit card giant Visa to apply blockchain technology to Smart Contracts that promise a streamlined \u2018click, sign and drive\u2019 approach to securely leasing a vehicle. Now if only they could reduce the price of those floor mats...  9. Music rights  Soon after music went digital with MP3 files, music piracy was close behind, with artists losing control of their work, and record companies unhappy over the lost revenue stream.  The entertainment industry is looking to blockchain technology to secure digital rights for music and other media, with the potential to recapture that income. The British company JAAK has grabbed attention with its effort to create Smart Content with a \u201cglobal view of content ownership and rights\u201d.  10. Worker credentials  When companies hire an individual for a job, they want to get the best qualified person with the most appropriate experience levels. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to discern the truth behind the average resume or CV, as more than half of folks reportedly lie on their job applications \u2013 and indeed one study showed that a quarter of applicants said they\u2019d worked for companies which in fact had never employed them.  This problem also arises at universities that need to verify the credentials of their faculty, and at hospitals that face a similar challenge when it comes to staff physicians and other healthcare professionals.  The Learning Machine is a company that hopes to change this. By applying blockchain technology, worker and professional credentials can be verified and kept in a secure digital ledger, which cannot be altered down the road to fit another position the applicant is subsequently interested in.

But because it\u2019s an admittedly nerve-wracking endeavor, we\u2019ve arranged our own do-it-yourself cyber security audit that you can perform for yourself by following a few easy steps.  Outdated software is a common culprit when it comes to failed cyber security audits. Whether your business is small or large, it\u2019s crucial that everyone is logged into the same network and using the same, most recent builds of whatever operating system you\u2019ve opted for. You may think you don\u2019t have to worry about your Linux-based servers, but if they\u2019re not up to date with the latest security measures you could be vulnerable.  For this reason you\u2019re going to want to use an enterprise network rather than deploying software manually on a per-computer basis. Doing so allows you or a specially trained team to implement and manage the company shield, instead of leaving everyone to fend for themselves.  No matter how skilled your employees, you can\u2019t trust everyone to constantly remain on top of security-related tasks in a timely manner. Installing a major software patch even a day or two late can open up your company to some particularly devastating threats \u2013 and the last thing you want your company known for is an outage.  2. Review your cyber security battalion  Take a look at who is in charge of your company\u2019s security push today. Is it an individual or a team of experts who know their trade better than they know you? It\u2019s critical that you assign clear-cut responsibility to someone who is as familiar with the ropes as they are with the back of their hands.  Once you\u2019ve assigned some sort of cybersecurity responsibility at your company, ensure that you communicate regularly with this person or group of people. And we'd go a step further, by ensuring that the people you\u2019ve put in charge are communicating clearly with other employees about the steps they're taking to safeguard your business.  When everyone working at your company is aware of cybersecurity procedures it's far less likely that unwelcome visitors will abuse your systems. Many authorities on the subject also recommend that you arrange for your employees to receive training on security posture, and you\u2019ll want to thoroughly document attendance at these events.  3. Assess currently instated measures  Here\u2019s where you\u2019ll want to inspect the hardware and software your company is using at the present. This goes hand-in-hand to some extent with step 1, and you\u2019ll want to make sure that your servers, databases as well as other hardware and software, are all connected to a secure network. Double-check that the programs your employees are using for work haven\u2019t been compromised with vulnerabilities.  The same principle applies to everything that comes in, or goes out, of your offices. That means laptops, tablets and mobile phones should be assessed, or else you\u2019ll be leaving the company at risk of malware and a multitude of other threats.  A lot of companies tend to ignore smartphones and other mobile devices when considering a cybersecurity plan of action. Nevertheless, these pose a threat that\u2019s equal to or sometimes greater than that from desktop workstation computers and servers. Bear that in mind as you reflect on the safety of all tools operated by corporate personnel.  4. Forestall any and all risks  Given that, according to the IBM Cyber Security Intelligence Index, human error is responsible for 95% of all security incidents that take place, ensure that such errors can\u2019t compromise you or your business. Threats such as phishing scams, ransomware and identity theft are increasingly ubiquitous in the information age, but there's lots you can do to guard against them.  By taking control of your network \u2013 or working with someone you trust to do it for you \u2013 you can keep security concerns down to a minimum. Of course, this means paying close attention to which sites and services your employees can access, and which of those are prone to malicious behavior.  Likewise, do your research. If one person in the IT department is the only one that understands your company\u2019s defenses, communicate with them and do your best to understand the ins and outs of the operation. Most importantly, prepare yourself to be informed and present in the unfortunate event that your company ends up in a bind, which leads us to our final point.  5. Plan ahead  Last, but certainly not least, you don\u2019t want to wait until you\u2019re under fire before you make a conscious decision to start getting proactive about cyber security \u2013 and you need to be prepared if an attack does happen, and have a post-breach recovery protocol up your sleeve.  Better yet, the plan ought to span multiple departments, rather than leaving IT in charge of the whole recovery process. The procedure for addressing such an episode must be put in writing, constantly updated to adhere to new developments in the cybersecurity field, and tested regularly to make sure it won\u2019t fail you in a real-world scenario.  With all of these steps in mind, your business can pass a proper cybersecurity audit with flying colors. That said, you will have to take steps above and beyond those outlined here to maximise protection against breaches in the foreseeable future. It's better to be safe than sorry.", "stock": "IBM"}, {"url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/5g-a-key-factor-to-seamless-vr-experience-says-lenovo-emea-president", "label": 1, "source": "techradar", "date": "2018-03-11", "article": "Lenovo spent a majority of MWC 2018 focusing on its new laptops, and showcasing its successful Moto Mods in the absence of the Motorola G6. It\u2019s been an interesting year for the company, with its server arm looking to grow into the market again, along with a host of new and updated consumer products.  EMEA President Francois Bornibus has witnessed Lenovo\u2019s growth in the region, but says that it\u2019s far from done. We caught up with him to talk about the Lenovo\u2019s strategy with AR and VR, and how the company is poised to harness 5G for a seamless VR experience from any location.  It\u2019s coming up to a year now with your role as EMEA President, from your previous role as EMEA COO. How has this changed your dynamic within Lenovo?  To be honest, there hasn\u2019t been much change at all! I\u2019ve been engaged with core parts of the business for so many years now, so there wasn\u2019t too much of a change with what I was doing. What\u2019s interesting to note is that when I joined the company seven years ago, Lenovo was selling notebooks to the larger accounts, because that was our history. The IBM and ThinkPad brands were sold to the enterprise market, and at that time we had about 8% EMEA market share.  Now the company is moving to 21.5% EMEA market share, covering all markets segments across a range of products \u2013 servers, AR/VR, detachables, laptops, PCs, and so much more. It\u2019s been a fantastic change for the company, and it\u2019s exciting to see what\u2019s in store for the future.  One of the things you\u2019ve been focusing on is the 2-in-1 market segment \u2013 do you still see a lot more growth for this?  The convertible concept we created four years ago is still a growing part of the business, and so is the market. For detachables the market isn\u2019t growing too much, but it\u2019s an important size of the market to keep an eye on and invest in. Our new Lenovo Mix 630 pushes an always-on, always-connected device, which is something the market has been looking for.  How have the Moto Mods been faring in the market since their launch?  Around one third of our customers are purchasing Moto Mods, which is a good sign. The initial offering of Moto Mods has now expanded to a larger variety as well \u2013 we have an Alexa-powered speaker, a Mod to measure blood pressure, and still many others on the market.  The health mod was especially successful, as we had a medical company approach us about it because they wanted to deploy this to customers so they could obtain a daily surveillance of important vital signs without having to send over a doctor every day. There are still plenty of other opportunities available, and the Moto Mods help to expand on the smartphone experience for consumers.  VR and AR was a huge focus this year - how is Lenovo able to differentiate its offerings from everything else that\u2019s coming to market?  It\u2019s all about the experience. Some products are similar, with content from different providers like Microsoft or Google. That\u2019s why for us it\u2019s all about making sure our customers have a unique experience with our products. The Star Wars Jedi Challenges for example, is a great partnership with Disney, and we\u2019re going to continue expanding on the kind of games that will be available.  VR and AR is also important for business applications as well, for example a travel agent that wants to show customers various travel packages and destinations. It has to be easy to use and immersive, but there\u2019s still a lot of work to do in order to make the experience as hassle-free and as enjoyable as possible. The headsets themselves are still quite big, so we need to continue to work on the technology to make it smaller and still usable.  Star Wars Jedi Challenges has been in the market for a few months now \u2013 what has feedback been like?  The feedback so far is that the product is very interesting, but there are two things we have to continue to work on. First is the content \u2013 the game is really fun and interesting, but we also have to try and look at other games or experiences we can offer customers.  Secondly we want to try and expand the number of supported phones, simply because the system requirements dictate that only high-end smartphones will work for the best experience. It\u2019s our first trial at making such a device, so we will keep listening and working on improvements and new content.  What are some scenarios you see the Mirage headset fitting into?  The Mirage headset and camera is all about sharing experiences, and that\u2019s where this device shines. It\u2019s going to be interesting to see how it does, but we have to be careful that the network capability is also there to support these new technologies. So wherever you are streaming from with your camera, the cellular network is powerful enough to provide a smooth experience for users.  Operators are looking at 5G technologies keenly, because AR/VR can use a lot of bandwidth which people will have to pay for. So in a way it\u2019s a great thing for operators to be looking at. It works in certain environments, but when you\u2019re talking about streaming from very remote places, you need to make sure you can get good connectivity for the best experience.  Is the Lenovo Smart Display your answer to a more interactive personal assistant?  Absolutely. People want to see what they\u2019re buying, not just hear a description being read out. So these kind of products will have a very interesting future. It might also lead to future new devices for a totally new ecosystem, who knows.

You either have to wait for a document to arrive through the letterbox or print it out from an email, physical sign the paper and either scan it and email it back or post it. In an era of constant connectivity and digital transformation, doesn\u2019t this seem archaic?  Esignature (or Esign) software can make your personal and office life that much easier. It eliminates a tedious, time consuming task into something that can be done with a few clicks. You can sign multiple documents at the same time and get paperwork to the right people as soon as they need it.  If you've already ditched physical snail mail, faxes and paperwork filing, then you'll wonder why you haven't looked into e-signatures before...  The only downside is that your fancy signature will soon be redundant.  1. Adobe Sign  We're going straight in with the big boy - Adobe Sign is the e-signature solution offered by one of the most famous names in the software business.  Adobe's service offers plenty of features and functionality. It's available via both the web and mobile app, so you can easily use your e-signature when away from the office. It offers an authentication service to ensure that those applied to important documents clear basic legal compliance, and of course you can personalize your e-signature, too.  Recent enhancements include compliance for life science and pharmaceutical firms and integration with SAP SuccessFactors.  For use between two to nine users, you'll need to sign up for Adobe Sign Team, costing $24.99 (\u00a326.10, around AU$32) per person per month. To see whether it's worth the cash, you can try a free 14-day trial first.  2. DocuSign  Claiming to have more than 200 million users worldwide, there's no denying the popularity of DocuSign. The company is a dedicated e-signature solution provider, offering straightforward to use software to quickly and easy get your documents signed.  It's easy to get going with DocuSign thanks to its number of integrations with the likes of Google, Windows, Apple and SalesForce, as well as a number of apps for mobile devices. It puts a lot of emphasis on security, using strong encryption technologies and employing industry best practices for protecting the data it handles.  Indeed, as of March 2018, DocuSign has had its application for Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs) approved. This is the EU's highest level of certification for data transfers outside the bloc.  Its pricing isn't dissimilar to Adobe's. Get DocuSign Standard for multiple users and you'll have to pay $25 (\u00a320, around AU$32) per user per month. You can try docusign for free first with a 30-day trial.  3. Secured Signing  Secured Signing is a more cost effective software than the above two e-signature solutions. It's cloud-based, meaning that it's easy to access and use your electronic signature from desktop, laptop or mobile device.  We're impressed by the sheer amount of extra services it offers. For example, there's a video confirmation feature where you can identify the signer and prevent any document tampering (if that's a concern). You can invite others to sign. And there's even options for document negotiation - a one-stop service to get to the all important dotted line as soon as possible.  A major update released in January offers automatic recognition of form fields in PDF files, multiple numbers of signature fields for the same witness and multi-page signing.  We also like that it's easier to customise your package and get better value as you add more users. The Team Edition starts at around $20/\u00a320 a month, but gets relatively cheaper for more people. Head over to Secured Signing for your tailored quote.  4. eSignLive  If you want endorsements from some familiar names, eSignLive has got some pretty big companies using its e-signature software. How do IBM, BMW and the US Army sound for starters?  That said, eSignLive still says that it's equally useful for small and large businesses alike, with an optimized, easy-to-use workflow across devices and personnel. It can be deployed on a public or private cloud, within your computing infrastructure only or a combination of the three. But as well as flexibility, the software also has the protection of your company's security at its heart.  You can get eSignLive for $20 (around \u00a315, AU$25) per user per month, or give have a go for free with a 30-day trial.  5. SignEasy  Although SignEasy can obviously be used from your office or home computer, it seems to have channeled a lot of effort into making it mobile ready. It's cloud-based - so can be accessed on the go - and the mobile experience for phones and tablets is very smartly laid out.  Otherwise, it has many of the same features as the above e-signature services, but there's a real focus on simplicity (as the name suggests). You can annotate signature boxes so that it's crystal clear who needs to sign and how. And if you find that the same kind of documents need to be electronically signed over and over again, then it's easy to set up templates for reuse.  SignEasy recently passed five million downloads and has agreed a partnership with WeWork to bring e-Signatures to its community.  Try before you buy with a 14-day trial. If you're a small business, then signing up to SignEasy is on the more affordable side - $15 (around \u00a312, AU$19) per month. But that's only for one sender. It's more like $80 (around \u00a362, AU$101) per month for the full premium plan of up to five users.  6. KeepSolid Sign  KeepSolid Sign is the offering from security and encryption specialists KeepSolid. It promises rapid, legally-binding signatures on any device, as well as offline access to signed contracts.  In terms of usability, there are annotation and collaboration tools alongside document tracking so its easy to make changes and work together on projects or legal processes. You can get documents from virtually any major cloud or email repository, including Google Drive, Dropbox, Box and iCloud. Simply import the document into KeepSolid Sign and add your signature.  The key selling point of KeepSolid is its security credentials as it fits into the company\u2019s wider portfolio of safety and privacy tools and the app is protected by AES-256 encryption.  There\u2019s a 14-day free trial, after which plans start at $9.99 a month for a personal subscription. A small team subscription covering five years is $39.99 a year and for ten users its $71.99. There are enterprise subscriptions on offer too.  How to choose an e-signature solution  Electronic signatures, often referred to as E-signatures, are a digital version of someone\u2019s \u201canalog\u201d or handwritten signature (not to be confused with digital signatures).  E-signature solutions were born out of the need to to accelerate the transition to the paperless office. There are now plenty of them in the market since the technology first came to market more than 20 years ago.  They have grown in popularity over the past few years as businesses of all sizes embrace the SaaS (software-as-a-service) paradigm which removes many of the inconveniences associated with some more traditional e-signature solutions.  Below are five important things to look for when you choose an e-signature solution.  1. Device agnostic  By that we mean that the process of signing should be seamless regardless of the device being used. Mac, PC, tablet or mobile handset. That applies to the document management part as well as in-person signing which allows third parties to sign to sign directly on your device and get the completed document delivered securely via email. Being able to do it anywhere and at anytime provides with a massive boost in efficiency, especially as it doesn\u2019t require any application (or app), just your standard browser and internet connectivity.  2. Connect to popular business applications and services  Tight integration with existing popular online applications such as Google Docs, Zoho, Dropbox, Salesforce, OneDrive or Evernote is critical to maintain the viability of your existing document workflow. That integration should be as seamless and as quick as possible so that users can hit the ground running with minimal downtime. Look out for APIs as well as they will allow you to push the integration even further, allowing developers to tailor the provision of e-signature for specific use cases.  3. Grow with the company  APIs usually give you the flexibility of scaling as far as you want. But just make sure that your e-signature provider can support your business demands with an adequate number of API requests, should you go that route with a number of tiers that correspond to your business needs. Having a tiered approach means that businesses can grow (or shrink) their e-signature service requirements without negatively impacting their bottom line.  4. Meet security, regulatory and authentication requirements  An electronic signature means nothing if you can\u2019t guarantee the authenticity of the sender, the recipient and the actual document. Having a robust audit trail feature helps as it provides with a shared and readily available list of who has done what and when. Make sure your e-signature provider complies at least with ESIGN (the U.S. Electronic Signature in Global and National Commerce Act of 2000), UETA ( Uniform Electronic Transactions Act) and eIDAS (European Union Directive 910/2014). And do make sure that your solution protects you not only from forgery but also from repudiation.  5. Excellent management capabilities  Being able to manage multiple list of signees and users of the e-signature solution within the company is important to maintain the integrity of the system. Granular control of team members, for example, should be high on your list as it allows various teams (e.g. sales, HR or legal) to have access to different documents and signees while sharing the same platform. The same goes for templates; having these ready allows for faster turnaround, which translates into more efficient processes.  Eversign is a newcomer in the world of e-signature but its impressive list of features will appeal both to small companies and big enterprises.", "stock": "IBM"}, {"url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/how-cloud-computing-will-evolve-over-the-next-12-months", "label": -1, "source": "techradar", "date": "2018-03-28", "article": "Cloud computing has been developing rapidly since the term was coined in 2006. It\u2019s played an integral role in the transformation of many businesses over the last decade, particularly valued for the reliability, scalability and versatility that cloud technology brings compared to traditional dedicated servers. And this race to the cloud will only gather pace as technology matures.  Having the ability to understand, evaluate and implement cloud computing is crucial for today\u2019s business leaders, regardless of whether they operate in IT or not. As business needs evolve, so too does cloud infrastructure.  There has been a strong growth within the private and hybrid cloud computing market, and in the next twelve months we can only expect that the technology will gain further importance and adoption.  Research company IDC\u2019s findings back this prediction up, by pointing out that a year ago traditional data centres accounted for 62 per cent of IT infrastructure spending, while public cloud captured 23 per cent and private cloud, 15 per cent.  Illustrating a rapid shift, IDG predicts that by 2020 data centres will represent 50 per cent of the market, with public cloud forming just under a third of the market and private cloud making up 20 per cent. In simple terms, data centres\u2019 importance is diminishing, while public and private cloud technology\u2019s value and usability is growing and gaining traction.  As the current cloud landscape is changing, what can we expect from this market in 2018?  Hybrid cloud computing will gain traction  Going back to basics, a hybrid cloud enables businesses to use a combination of different cloud model types. For example: a public cloud with a private cloud, or one private cloud with another one, or one public cloud with a second public cloud. Some businesses see hybrid cloud use as a way to deal with IT demand peaks, while others view it as a central management experience.  Many companies tend to start working with hybrid clouds to complement their present investments. For instance, as most businesses usually use a sliding scale for what aspects of their operations are most crucial, some would place the less valuable or security-demanding areas in the public cloud. Meanwhile, other aspects that need more control and safety would be directed to the private cloud within that hybrid cloud space. This way, they can control and oversee their operations and systems management. With the increasing adoption of hybrid cloud computing, we will see the market grow steadily.  While last year was important for experimenting and learning about the technology, cloud vendors will continue to crystallise their strategies throughout this year. One vivid example is Microsoft\u2019s launch of private cloud platform Azure Stack, the purpose of which is to mirror the Azure public cloud. Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services partnered with platform virtualisation giant VMware, to offer a new hybrid cloud extension. Further, Oracle and IBM now have their own hybrid cloud offerings. These are only a few examples of how, as major cloud vendors\u2019 strategies are gelling, they will gain momentum as their clients continue to seek the best ways to manage their public and private clouds.  Another important development will be the optimisation of connections to the cloud. Very few companies use only one cloud model \u2013 many have both public and private clouds. This means that if a business uses a hybrid cloud, it can certainly benefit from access to an optimised network connection to that cloud. This need has led to a growth in the interconnection providers market, known as multi-clouds, and as hybrid cloud computing becomes popular, businesses will need to prioritise creating, maintaining and optimising such connections.  The emergence of multi-clouds  With the increased exploration of hybrid cloud, people will also start turning their heads to emerging options such as multi-clouds, which are naturally evolving from hybrid cloud use. Multi-clouds enable the use of multiple cloud computing services in a single infrastructure. For example, a company can use separate cloud providers for its infrastructure and software services, or it can use a number of infrastructure providers for a variety of workloads. This is when multi-cloud architecture comes into play, as it enables businesses to increase their cloud operations\u2019 availability. So, if one of the cloud vendors in the architecture is experiencing a problem, the business can switch workloads from it to a different vendor\u2019s infrastructure.  There are a number of reasons why multi-clouds will become increasingly powerful and valued. They enable the complete integration of all the prevalent public clouds like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform. They also optimise multi-cloud management into one sole activity, by allowing a wide-ranging cloud network to exist in a single platform. Furthermore, multi-clouds enable the automation of IT networking, which makes it easy to connect to and switch between public and private clouds. More importantly, centralised cloud networking management enables a business to access, control, analyse and trace faults in all its cloud resources in one unifying place. This can bring business optimisation and increased efficiency \u2013 and what business doesn\u2019t want that?  All of this means that the emergence, and eventually adoption, of multi-cloud computing focuses on connectivity and therefore brings more relevance to networking and to the easier ways of managing networks. Having looked at the emerging cloud options and the changing landscape, we also need to consider the reasons why more enterprises turn to cloud providers.  The hyperscale of cloud providers  Amazon, Microsoft and Google\u2019s cloud infrastructure is on such a large scale, that we talk about them as a hyperscale cloud, as opposed to a mere cloud. While they offer a hosting service that is safe, scalable and global, they are also constantly innovating and collaborating, ensuring that they\u2019re experiencing immense growth because of it.  Hyperscale providers are in a features arms race, the latest battleground being the creation of machine learning and artificial intelligence platforms, steadily revolutionising these spaces. Over the next twelve months we can be certain to observe a further consolidation of their services, with hyperscale providers building platforms that are easy to consume and reduce operational costs. This will naturally lead to decreasing cloud expenditure as these become more mature, more accessible and easier to work with, driving a further decline in traditional computing.  Companies\u2019 digital transformations have come a long way, but as cloud platforms continue to innovate and as machine learning and artificial intelligence become increasingly efficient, businesses need to carefully evaluate what is right for them long term. This is not a decision that can just be taken by the IT team any more.  Consequently, many organisations, wondering where to start, turn to managed service providers accredited by hyperscale cloud providers, as they can design and deliver bespoke cloud computing solutions that are tailored to an organisation\u2019s specific needs. Using the help of a trusted expert and solution-led infrastructure company is often the best way to solve a business challenge with technology, and to be safely guided through the journey to the cloud.

While this works well for many websites, having fixed resources can be a problem for larger projects. There's generally no way to temporarily allocate extra RAM or bandwidth if you experience an increase in traffic, and even a simple plan upgrade might require your website to go offline for a while.  Cloud hosting plans look much like virtual private server (VPS) products, where you'll initially pay for a set amount of web space, RAM, CPU time and bandwidth. But these resources are spread across multiple devices instead of just one, and changing your plan later \u2013 adding another gig of RAM, for instance \u2013 is generally as easy as dragging a slider, with the extra power coming online within moments.  This flexibility is great for delivering extra power when you need it most, and starting prices can be similar to regular VPS hosting (from \u00a310 or $14 a month). Costs will rise as you add resources, but typically you'll only pay for the time in which you use these resources.  DigitalOcean's monster 192GB RAM, 32 vCPU and 3,840GB SSD product costs $960 (\u00a3685) a month, for instance, but this pay-as-you-go approach allows you to try it out for $1.429 or \u00a31.02 an hour.  Cloud hosting still won't be for everyone, and small, simple websites are likely to be better off with regular packages. But the technology has a lot to offer anyone with larger or more ambitious projects, and many hosts run free trials which make it easy to explore their abilities for yourself.  Check out the best web hosting services for 2018  A great option for smaller operations  Simple to use  Solid range of plans  Temptingly priced with initial discounts  Cloud hosting isn't just for big business. HostGator's cloud platform spreads your website load across multiple virtual server instances for more reliable and scalable hosting, but it's as easy to use as standard shared hosting, and only costs a little more.  For example, the baseline Hatchling Cloud plan gets you support for one domain, unmetered bandwidth and storage, a share of up to two cores and 2GB RAM, and distributed Varnish caching to speed up the loading of static content. You can get started for as little as $4.95 (\u00a33.50) a month if you buy three years upfront, although the price leaps to $8.95 (\u00a36.40) on renewal.  If you need something more powerful, the top-of-the-range Business Cloud plan supports unlimited domains, gives you up to six cores and 6GB RAM, and includes private SSL and a dedicated IP. Another chunky introductory discount means you can pay as little as $9.95 (\u00a37.10) a month over three years, but after that you'll pay $17.95 (\u00a312.80) per month.  Benefits of the cloud plans include (up to) twice as fast load times, along with more site statistics, and because your site is mirrored across multiple devices, the ability to switch your site to another server in the event of a hardware failure.  But the key advantage of all cloud hosting schemes is scalability. If your site can't cope with demand, you can scale up to eight cores and 8GB RAM with a click. There's no waiting around for someone to process your order and no downtime while your web space is reallocated \u2013 you get the extra resources right away.

Seven standard root access (self-managed) configurations aim to cover everyone from the individual user (\u00a39.99 or $14 a month for a single CPU core, 1GB RAM and 50GB storage) to big businesses (16 cores, 48GB RAM and 500GB storage for a monster \u00a3349 or $488 a month).  All plans have decent specifications, giving you unlimited traffic and email accounts, a bundled SSL certificate, DDoS protection and a choice of US and European data centers.  A wide range of options includes Windows hosting, or managed hosting with your choice of stack: Apache + MySQL + PHP 7.2, Nginx + MariaDB + PHP 7.2, Joomla, Drupal, WordPress and more.  The highlight of the range is probably 1&1's Cloud Hosting Flex package. Not only does this allow for adjusting cores, RAM and storage on demand, and adding up to 99 servers to the same contract, but billing is by the minute and you're only charged for what you use.  Prices start at \u00a322.28 ($31.20) a month including the management fee. There's no long-term contract and the first 30 days is free, giving you the chance to try before you buy.  A neat compromise between power and ease-of-use  User-friendly yet powerful  Highly configurable  Free trial  At first glance, cloud hosting products seem to be divided into two clear groups: user-friendly but basic products from hosts like 1&1, and enterprise-level technology from Amazon, Microsoft, IBM and more, which is so complex that even experts might struggle to set it up.  Cloudways represents an interesting middle path. The company offers managed cloud hosting which is powered by your choice of the top providers \u2013 Amazon, Google, DigitalOcean, Kyup, Linode or Vultr are supported \u2013 and comes packed with features, yet is configured from a simple web console which is just as easy to use as the more basic competition.  It's an impressive platform. Cloudways' ThunderStack covers all your core performance needs: Nginx, Apache, Memcached, MySQL/MariaDB, Varnish Cache, PHP 7, PHP-FM and Redis. There's one-click cloning, backup and restore, integrated Git and team collaboration tools for developers, and no less than 25 data centers strategically placed around the world.  Despite all this high-end functionality, Cloudways products are generally simple to operate, and prices start at a beginner-friendly $10 (\u00a37.15) a month for one core, 1GB RAM, 25GB storage and 1TB of bandwidth. It's all supremely configurable, and a free trial allows you to check out the product, with no credit card details required.  A UK-based outfit which offers some unusual perks  Lots of flexibility  In-house platform using open source  Help to configure firewall, backups and more  Founded in 2002, Bytemark is a UK-based cloud hosting company which has designed its own public platform using open source software.  This in-house experience brings some unusual advantages. Bytemark has developed its own hosting environment to set up a server, email and more. It covers everything from installing and managing PHP, MySQL, Perl and Ruby on Rails to helping you configure your firewall, spam rules and backups.  Experienced users can manage their account with a command line client, or even automate common tasks by integrating with Bytemark's API.  Pricing seems fair. The baseline specification costs \u00a310 ($14) for one core, 1GB RAM, 25GB storage, 1TB bandwidth and one IPv4, plus \u2013 unusually \u2013 one IPv6 address. If you need more, everything is available via a simple flat rate: \u00a310 ($14) per 1GB RAM, \u00a32 ($2.80) per 10GB storage, \u00a320 ($28) per extra 1TB of traffic. Unusually, you can even get a Windows licence for only \u00a31 ($1.40) per GB of memory.  As ever with cloud hosting, there's plenty of flexibility. You can configure your servers with anything from 1 to 180GB RAM, 1 to 16 CPU cores, and 1 to 8 individual disks with either fast SSD or cheaper archive storage.  If you're interested, Bytemark's free trial gives you seven days or a \u00a350 ($70) spend (whichever comes first) to find out more.  Hosting for the more demanding user  Really well-featured  Highly flexible  Transparent pricing  While cloud hosting schemes always involve pooling resources from multiple devices, most do their best to keep you away from the low-level details. You may be able to scale your plan by adding CPU cores, RAM or storage, for instance, but the console will present this to you as a single system.  DigitalOcean's Droplets are based around similar resizable and customizable virtual machines, but that's just the start \u2013 the technology has much more to offer.  For starters, the system supports Droplets of different types. If the standard plans aren't enough \u2013 priced from $5 (\u00a33.55) a month for one core, 1GB RAM and 25GB storage \u2013 Optimized Droplets aim to ramp up your performance by using the best Broadwell and Skylake CPUs, and providing more RAM and storage space.  Individual Droplets have more features than you might expect, including performance monitoring and alerts, snapshots and automatic system-level backups.  There are various interesting ways to work with your Droplets as a group, including setting up a cloud firewall, and using a load balancer to distribute incoming traffic across your infrastructure.  DigitalOcean's transparent pricing is a highlight. You're billed hourly, with monthly caps, ensuring you only pay for the resources you use. Many of the features come for free \u2013 monitoring, cloud firewall \u2013 while others follow very simple pricing rules. Snapshots cost $0.05 per gigabyte per month, for instance, while backups are priced at 20% of the cost of the virtual machine \u2013 easy.  If all you want to do is host a scalable WordPress site, this will probably be overkill, but developers, sysadmins and other more demanding users will appreciate the power and flexibility DigitalOcean offers. Browse the lengthy list of tutorials (which numbers 1,809 at the time of writing) on the DigitalOcean site to find out more.

As in sport, so in consulting, except in one important regard. Consulting, unlike the Olympics, is about the winning, not the taking part. So which is the best consultancy in the UK, based on the views of peers and clients?  For the UK\u2019s Leading Management Consultants 2018, Statista, the research and data provider, sorted recommendations into three categories. Six stars were awarded to firms \u201cvery frequently recommended\u201d in a consulting service or sector, five for \u201cfrequently recommended\u201d and four for \u201crecommended\u201d. Let us call these the gold, silver and bronze \u201cmedals\u201d in each \u201cevent\u201d. Deloitte, KPMG and McKinsey top the table by total number of medals \u2014 they each won star ratings in 29 sectors and services, the maximum.  This version of the table tells a familiar story: there is a gap between the largest, universal consultancies and the rest. Recommendations were made in at least 21 of the categories for the Big Four accountancy firms (Deloitte, KPMG, PwC and EY), the Big Three traditional strategy consultancies (McKinsey, Boston Consulting Group and Bain) and Accenture.  But this is only one way of arranging a medals table. At the 2016 Rio Olympics, for instance, Team GB won fewer medals overall than China, but beat China in the ranking by number of gold medals.  If one cuts the consulting medal tally in a similar way, it reveals a different picture: Accenture comes top. Despite gaining no medal ratings in two categories, it achieved 18 six-star ratings overall, against KPMG\u2019s 17, Deloitte\u2019s 12 and McKinsey\u2019s 11. This table also elevates IBM to equal fifth with PwC, for its nine \u201cgolds\u201d.  There is more to this than meets the eye. The Management Consultancies Association \u2014 a trade body whose members include Deloitte, KPMG and PwC \u2014 pointed out in its recent analysis of UK industry data that in 2016, the largest firms grew by 4 per cent on average. Medium-sized firms did better, growing by 6 per cent, and specialists\u2019 growth exceeded 20 per cent.  A similar story is told by our ranking. On overall medal tally, there is a notable gap between Bain (which garnered 21 six-, five- or four-star ratings) and the next highest groups, IBM (14) and AT Kearney and PA Consulting (13 each).  But the alternative view shows it is possible for specialists to win gold in single events. For example, Atkins Global topped the podium in the construction and infrastructure sector. OC&C was among the gold medallists in consumer goods and retail, and BAE destroyed all-comers in defence. Hay Group, part of Korn Ferry, the executive search firm, since 2015, wins gold in its specialist area of people and performance.  These companies join Oliver Wyman, Baringa and Simon-Kucher in a cluster of seven consultancies that won the top ranking in one sector or service. In this analysis of the ranking, they jump above AT Kearney and PA, which achieved no six-star ratings.  Some distinct subsidiaries of the biggest companies are winning recommendations, often by specialising, for example QuantumBlack, McKinsey\u2019s data analytics arm.  If anything, the ranking may overstate the importance of the bigger groups, whose balance sheets buy a lot of name recognition.  What an at-a-glance analysis of the table does suggest is that trying to be all things to all clients is probably futile unless you are one of the largest consultancies. On the other hand, a strategy of smart specialisation could pay off. After all, if you are a small nation that is home to the world\u2019s best weightlifters, why try to beat the USA in the track and field events?

Today many people rate plastic waste, particularly in the oceans, as a problem approaching climate change in its gravity.  Graphic images have raised public consciousness. Photographs have shown some of the world\u2019s most remote beaches that were pristine sand a decade or two ago now covered with plastic litter.  Films and television programmes such as David Attenborough\u2019s immensely popular Blue Planet II series have recorded heart-rending scenes of seabirds and marine creatures dying from plastics that they have mistakenly eaten or from debris entangled around their bodies.  People are also becoming alarmed by reading about the less visible but more pernicious problem of microplastics with dimensions measured in fractions of a millimetre. These come from various sources including the disintegration of larger plastic items, microbeads added to health and beauty products, and microfibres separating from clothing and fabrics during cleaning and laundry. The tiny particles and fibres are ingested by marine wildlife, with adverse consequences that environmental toxicologists are just beginning to investigate.  As the clamour to \u201cdo something\u201d rises in volume, politicians are responding with pledges to increase recycling and to reduce unnecessary plastic packaging. At the same time, research funds are starting to move into the field, prompting scientists and engineers to come up with ideas to tackle the problem, both by finding ways to remove existing waste from the oceans and, more importantly, to stem the flow of new plastics into the environment.  Professor Mariana Mazzucato of University College London proposed that Europe\u2019s next Framework research programme should adopt \u201ca plastic-free ocean\u201d as one of its grand challenges.  \u201cThis mission could have clear target to reduce the amount of plastic entering the marine environment by 90 per cent, and of collecting more than half of the plastic currently present in our oceans, seas and coastal areas,\u201d she says in a paper commissioned by EU science and innovation commissioner Carlos Moedas.  This would mean stopping at least 7.2m tonnes of plastic entering the marine environment and collecting at least 2m tonnes of plastic per annum, the paper adds, concluding that \u201ca very ambitious yet achievable timeline to reach this target would be circa five to 10 years\u201d.  Such a comprehensive attempt to tackle the crisis will require basic and applied research, as well as entrepreneurial innovation. The greatest technological challenge will be removing plastics from the oceans, through nets and booms moving across the sea surface which would gather up and remove or destroy rubbish \u2014 all without harming ocean life. The first targets might be the ocean gyres, circulating currents where plastics accumulate, of which the most notorious has become known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.  The Ocean Cleanup, a Dutch foundation that is planning to launch a clean-up operation there later this year, estimated in a study carried out from boats and aircraft and published this month that the Patch contains 1.8tn pieces of plastic weighing a total of 80,000 tonnes, covering 1.6m sq km of the North Pacific between California and Hawaii.  \u201cThese results provide us with the key data to develop and test our technology,\u201d says Boyan Slat, founder of Ocean Cleanup. \u201cSince the results indicate that the amount of hazardous microplastics is set to increase more than tenfold if left to fragment, the time to start is now.\u201d  The clean-up system is itself made of durable plastic. \u201cIt\u2019s quite poetic, like using fire to extinguish fire,\u201d says Mr Slat.  Floating screens extend 3m deep into the sea, suspended from ultra-strong U-shaped tubes 1km long and held in place by a drogue or sea anchor. As ocean currents flow past the screens they collect plastic debris, which can be collected every couple of months by ships for recycling or incineration.  If this year\u2019s trial of the first system goes well, Mr Slat hopes that as many as 60 collectors will be operating in the early 2020s, removing about half of the plastic from the Great Pacific Garbage Patch within five years.  Stopping plastics getting into the oceans in the first place will require a huge change in consumer behaviour and product design \u2014 fuelled by a global commitment by governments and business to phase out non-essential single-use plastics, particularly for packaging, and make it easier to recycle remaining plastic waste.  Such a circular economy will require plastic products to have a simple design, in which the different components are easily separated and the polymers from which they are made are clearly identifiable. At present the sorting machinery in recycling plants faces a confusing variety of materials mixed \u2014 or, worse, bonded \u2014 together.  Polymer chemists will also need to come up with new ways to recycle plastics that are elusive under current technology. A recent paper in the journal Science by Jeannette Garcia of IBM Almaden research centre in California and Megan Robertson of the University of Houston concluded that only two types of polymer are routinely recycled today: PET and polyethylenes, representing just 9 per cent and 37 per cent respectively of plastic production.  Researchers are already developing cost-effective new chemical recycling technologies for other plastics such as polystyrene. Such efforts, the authors say, \u201craise hope that before long recycling rates for plastics will be much higher than today\u201d.", "stock": "IBM"}, {"url": "https://www.ft.com/content/e70a58f0-db69-11e7-9504-59efdb70e12f", "label": -1, "source": "financial-times", "date": "2018-02-05", "article": "Experimental feature Listen to this article Play audio for this article Pause 00:00 00:00 Experimental feature Report a mispronounced word What was mispronounced?

Our behaviour is changing as a result of an information and communications overload, both at work and in our personal lives. Finding a way to manage the barrage is an important challenge as the information economy develops.  Distractions at work, such as the constant inflow of emails, notifications and pop-up chats, take their toll. One study, by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University, found that the mere prospect of being distracted by a ringing mobile phone reduced test participants\u2019 cognition skills, measured by a test involving reading a passage of text and being asked questions about it.  Our addiction to smartphones and social media is also making us more fidgety. One study of Android users by research company Dscout found that people tapped, swiped and clicked their smartphones 2,617 times a day. Apple\u2019s products are sufficiently addictive to prompt activist investors to demand research be done into the negative impacts of phone use on children. There is growing concern about a mental health crisis in young people caused by the addictiveness of social media, the internet, and gaming.  When you get bored you ignite the \u2018default mode\u2019 in your brain, and this is where we do our most original thinking  \u201cThere is nothing new about the existence of an attention economy that monetises our eyeballs,\u201d says Cal Newport, associate professor of computer science at Georgetown University and author of Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World. \u201cBut when you combine this business model with powerful handheld devices that are always connected to the internet, algorithms being weaponized to extract as much of our time and attention as possible, and hundreds of billions of dollars of investment, suddenly the societal impacts become worrisome.\u201d  Prof Newport is worried about the next generation. \u201cIt is almost certainly true that young people are suffering a rapid decline in their ability to concentrate. Given the increasing share of the economy dedicated to knowledge work, in which concentrated thought is the primary driver of value production, this decline might start to impact large scale economic metrics, if it hasn\u2019t already\u201d.  Overcoming overload is hard, because we are addicted to information \u2014 or, more specifically, to novelty  If information overload stops us concentrating deeply, it also stops us resting deeply \u2014 and that is just as damaging. Boredom, zoning out and absent-mindedness are all fertile mental states for creativity. \u201cWe\u2019re at an interesting moment in neuroscience in terms of understanding how boredom is a gateway to mind-wandering,\u201d says Manoush Zomorodi, host of the WNYC podcast Note to Self and author of Bored and Brilliant.  \u201cWhen you get bored, say you are folding laundry, or doing something that doesn\u2019t require focused attention, you ignite the \u2018default mode\u2019 in your brain, and this is where we do our most original thinking,\u201d she says. \u201cWe take two seemingly disparate ideas and smash them together to make something new. And we do autobiographical planning. We look back at our life, take note of highs and lows, create personal narratives, and look at our future and decide where we want to go.\u201d  If in a quiet moment we instead check for emails or social media updates, then we may be in danger of losing the experience of boredom entirely.  Overcoming overload is hard, because we are addicted to information \u2014 or, more specifically, to novelty. This was helpful in the hunter-gatherer era, because it could lead us to food and resources. It is less helpful online, where we cannot ever be satiated. Companies are tapping this foraging-related brain circuitry to make products more addictive. One gamification firm, with clients including Disney and Google, even named itself Dopamine, after the brain chemical.  Some of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest names are raising the alarm, from Facebook\u2019s founding president Sean Parker to former Google design ethicist Tristan Harris.  Is there a solution?  \u00a9 EPA  Yet there are glimmers of hope. Consumers, and even investors, are paying more attention to the problem. Facebook published a study confirming that its users do indeed feel worse after \u2018passively\u2019 consuming social media. It argued however that social media increased wellbeing when people used them actively, especially when \u201csharing messages, posts and comments with close friends and reminiscing about past interactions\u201d. It recently announced changes to its news feed, to prioritise the sharing of meaningful content between friends.  At work, companies are deploying software, artificial intelligence and machine learning to bring order and structure to the informational chaos that many office workers now feel. Slack can reduce email overload by shifting high-volume, open-ended communications into chat forums. IBM Verse and SalesforceIQ sift information and prioritise actions for staff. Google has rolled out auto-reply suggestions on Gmail, with algorithms proposing possible replies to messages, and tools like Evernote consolidate scattered online and offline notes, links and resources.  Then there are the apps and internet blockers which forcibly disconnect people from certain sites, or during certain times, including Thrive App, from Arianna Huffington\u2019s wellbeing consultancy and Samsung.  The power of the humble notebook  Meanwhile Prof Newport, who gained tenure at the young age of 33 without working in the evenings or at weekends, says the humble notebook is his tool of choice. His reasons are subtle, relating to the ways in which the finitude of three dimensional space shapes our thinking. \u201cWhen scheduling your day in a notebook, the fact that the page is a fixed size embodies the reality that your time and attention are limited commodities. Days scheduled on paper tend to be more realistic and balanced than those driven [by] a bottomless inbox or voluminous digital task list.\u201d  Research also shows that writing on paper fires up the brain circuitry associated with language processing and engenders more attentive reading. All of which might give us reason to pause before rolling out the tablets, laptops and digital education for an already screen-sapped generation.

Then, the machine learning model determined, based on those speech patterns, who was at risk of developing psychosis and who wasn't. Of those participants, 19 developed a psychotic disorder within two years while 40 did not and the model was able to predict that with 83 percent accuracy. It was also able to differentiate speech patterns of patients who had recently developed psychosis from those of healthy patients with 72 percent accuracy. The program found that those at risk of psychosis used fewer possessive pronouns when speaking and constructed less coherent sentences.  While the work is still ongoing, it shows that AI could be an effective tool and could be particularly useful when mental health professionals are in short supply or aren't available. \"We believe this is a significant step towards the goal of developing a tool for mental health practitioners, caregivers and patients themselves with a tool that can expand and multiply the reach of neuropsychiatric assessment outside of the clinic,\" said study author Guillermo Cecchi in a blog post.

In fact, IBM already released a Watson-powered voice assistant for cybersecurity early last year. You'll be able to access Watson Assistant via text or voice, depending on the device and how IBM's partner decides to incorporate it. So, you'll definitely be using voice if it's a smart speaker, but you might be able to text commands to a home device.  Speaking of commands, it wasn't just designed to follow them -- it was designed to learn from your actions and remember your preferences. If you allow the Watson-powered applications you use to access each other's data through IBM Cloud, which delivers and enables Assistant's capabilities, they can learn more about you and deliver life-like conversations with context.  In IBM's sample scenario, it said Watson Assistant can automatically check you into your hotel and make sure your rental car (so long as it has a Watson-powered console) is ready as soon as you walk out the airport. The car's console can suggest locations to visit en route to your hotel, as well. If the hotel uses a smart assistant powered by IBM's AI, then it can automatically tweak your room's temperature and lighting based on your preferences and even start playing music you like when you're almost there. The hotel room's (Watson-powered) wall dashboard can also display your schedule and emails before you even walk in using the electronic key automatically sent to your phone.  All those are made possible by allowing all Watson apps to access each other's data. Of course, they're just imaginary scenarios that can only become reality if Watson Assistant experiences widespread adoption.

The thing is, while quantum computing is a technology for the world of tomorrow, it hasn't yet advanced far enough for anyone to know what that world will actually look like.  \"People aren't going to just wake up in three or four years, and say, 'Oh okay, now I'm ready to use quantum, what do I have to learn,'\" Bob Sutor, VP of IBM Q Strategy and Ecosystem at IBM Research, told Engadget.  These systems rely on the \"spooky\" properties of quantum physics, as Einstein put it, and their operation is radically different from how today's computers work. \"What you're basically doing is you're replacing the notion of bits with something called qubits,\" Sutor said. \"Ultimately when you measure a qubit it's zero or one, but before that there's a realm of freedom of what that can actually be. It's not zero and one at the same time or anything like this, it just takes on values from a much, much larger mathematical space.  \"The basic logic gates [AND, OR, NOT, NOR, etc], those gates are different for quantum,\" he continued. \"The way the different qubits work together to get to a solution is completely different from the way the bits within your general memory works.\" Rather than tackling problems in sequence, as classical computers do, quantum rigs attempt to solve them in parallel. This enables quantum computers to solve certain equations, such as modeling complex molecules, far more efficiently.  This efficiency, however, is tempered by the system's frailty. Currently, a qubit's coherence time tops out at 90 microseconds before decaying. That is, if a qubit is designated as a 1, it'll only remain a 1 for 0.0009 seconds. \"After that all bets are off. You've got a certain amount of time in which to actually use this thing reliably,\" Sutor said. \"Any computations you're going to do with a qubit have to come within that period.\"  As such quantum computers are highly sensitive to interference from temperature, microwaves, photons, even the electricity running the machine itself. Sutor said, \"With heat you've got lots of electrons moving around, bumping into each other,\" which can lead to the qubit's decoherence. That's why these rigs have to be cooled to near absolute zero on order to operate.  \"Outer space in the shade is between two and three degree Kelvin,\" Sutor explained. \"Outer space is much too warm to do these types of calculations.\" Instead, the lowest levels of a quantum computer rig, where the calculations themselves take place, exist at a frosty 10 millikelvin -- a hundreth of a degree above absolute zero. So no, Sutor assured Engadget, we probably shouldn't expect desktop quantum computers running at room temperature to exist within the next few decades -- perhaps even within our lifetimes.  Surprisingly, these systems are fairly energy efficient. Aside from the energy needed to sufficiently cool the system for operation (a process that takes around 36 hours) IBM's 50-qubit rig only draws 10 to 15 kilowatts of power -- roughly equivalent to 10 standard microwave ovens.  So now that IBM has developed a number of quantum computer systems ranging from 5 to 50 qubits, the next challenge is figuring out what to do with them. And that's where the company's Q network comes in. Last December, IBM announced that it's partnering with a number of Fortune 500 companies and research institutes -- including JPMorgan Chase, Samsung, Honda, Japan's Keio University, Oak Ridge National Lab and Oxford University -- to suss out potential practical applications for the technology.  Learning centers like Keio University also act as localized hubs. \"We in IBM research, while we have a large team on this, we can't work with everybody in the world who wants to work on quantum computing,\" Sutor explained. These hubs, however, \"can work with local companies, local colleges, whomever to do whatever. They would get their quantum computer power from us, but they would be at the front lines.\" The same is true for Oakridge National Lab, Oxford University and the University of Melbourne.  What's more, the company has also launched the IBM Q experience which allows anyone -- businesses, universities, even private citizens -- to write and submit their own quantum application or experiment to be run on the company's publicly available quantum computing rig. It's essentially a cloud service for quantum computations. So far more than 75,000 people have taken advantage of the service, running more than 2.5 million calculations which have resulted in more than two dozen published research papers on subjects ranging from quantum phase space measurement to homomorphic encryption.  But while the public's interest in this technology is piqued, there is a significant knowledge gap that must be overcome before we start to see quantum applications proliferate the way classical programs did in the 1970s and '80s. \"Let's say in the future you're running investment house types of calculations [similar to the financial risk applications that JP Morgan is currently developing],\" Sutor points out, \"there are big questions as to what those would be, and what the algorithms would be. We're way too early to have anything determined like that, even to the extent of knowing how well [quantum computing] will be applicable in some of these other areas.\"  The entry point for writing programs is a challenge too. For classical computers, it's as simple as running a compiler. But there's not yet such a function for quantum computers. \"What does it mean to optimize a quantum program knowing that this completely different from the model that's in your phone?\" he queried.  Another challenge that must be overcome is how to scale these machines. As Sutor points out, it's a simple enough task to add qubits to silicon chips, but every component added, increases the amount of heat generated and the amount of energy needed to keep the system within its operational temperature boundaries.  So rather than simply packing in more and more qubits and setting off a quantum version of Moore's Law, Sutor believes that the next major step forward for this technology is quality over quantity. \"Having 50 great qubits is much more powerful than having 2,000 lousy ones,\" he quipped. \"You don't want something very noisy that you're going to have to fix,\" but instead research should focus on improving the system's fidelity over increasing the qubit count.", "stock": "IBM"}, {"url": "https://www.engadget.com/2018/01/24/artificial-synapse-portable-ai/", "label": 1, "source": "engadget", "date": "2018-01-24", "article": "Existing designs that typically use non-crystalline solid or amorphous materials have difficulties controlling that flow of ions, which means they're not that successful in moving info from neuron to neuron.

Team leader Jeehwan Kim said that together, the \"two perfectly mismatched materials can form a funnel-like dislocation, creating a single path through which ions can flow.\"  They tested their creation by using it on a chip for their neural network, which they fed with tens of thousands of handwriting samples. The result? It was able to recognize handwriting 95 percent of the time -- not bad, seeing as current algorithms powered by typical hardware have a 97 percent accuracy.  Neuromorphic computing will be able to do lot more than recognize handwritten samples, though. In the future, it could lead to portable AI devices much more powerful than your already impressive modern smartphone. \"Ultimately we want a chip as big as a fingernail to replace one big supercomputer,\" Kim said. \"This opens a stepping stone to produce real artificial hardware.\"  [ From left: MIT researchers Scott H.

Subsequently, the name was purchased by a French reseller that used it to sell IBM-compatible PCs and accessories, including external hard drives. It, too, collapsed in December 2009, leading to the brand being revived a third time in 2015. This time around, the brand has been purchased by Sam Goult, co-founder of British tablet brand MyGo.

Conceived in collaboration with the science-fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke, \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey\u201d was way over budget, and Hollywood rumor held that MGM had essentially bet the studio on the project.  The film\u2019s previews were an unmitigated disaster. Its story line encompassed an exceptional temporal sweep, starting with the initial contact between pre-human ape-men and an omnipotent alien civilization and then vaulting forward to later encounters between Homo sapiens and the elusive aliens, represented throughout by the film\u2019s iconic metallic-black monolith. Although featuring visual effects of unprecedented realism and power, Kubrick\u2019s panoramic journey into space and time made few concessions to viewer understanding. The film was essentially a nonverbal experience. Its first words came only a good half-hour in.  Audience walkouts numbered well over 200 at the New York premiere on April 3, 1968, and the next day\u2019s reviews were almost uniformly negative. Writing in the Village Voice, Andrew Sarris called the movie \u201ca thoroughly uninteresting failure and the most damning demonstration yet of Stanley Kubrick\u2019s inability to tell a story coherently and with a consistent point of view.\u201d And yet that afternoon, a long line\u2014comprised predominantly of younger people\u2014extended down Broadway, awaiting the first matinee.  Stung by the initial reactions and under great pressure from MGM, Kubrick soon cut almost 20 minutes from the film. Although \u201c2001\u201d remained willfully opaque and open to interpretation, the trims removed redundancies, and the film spoke more clearly. Critics began to come around. In her review for the Boston Globe, Marjorie Adams, who had seen the shortened version, called it \u201cthe world\u2019s most extraordinary film. Nothing like it has ever been shown in Boston before, or for that matter, anywhere. The film is as exciting as the discovery of a new dimension in life.\u201d  \u2018Stanley and I are laughing all the way to the bank.\u2019  Although incomprehensible by prevailing Hollywood standards, Kubrick\u2019s cryptic, mostly dialogue-free structure fit well with the radical avant-garde artistic innovations of the period, and the movie was an immediate countercultural hit. John Lennon quipped, \u201c\u20182001\u2019? I see it every week,\u201d and David Bowie was inspired to record his hit single \u201cSpace Oddity\u201d just under a year later\u2014a clear allusion to the film. \u201c2001\u201d became a genuine late-\u201960s cultural happening and a bellwether of the decade\u2019s generational divide. With ticket sales brisk from day one, the production ended up the highest-grossing film of 1968. \u201cAs for the dwindling minority who still don\u2019t like it, that\u2019s their problem, not ours,\u201d Clarke wrote. \u201cStanley and I are laughing all the way to the bank.\u201d  Fifty years later, \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey\u201d is widely recognized as ranking among the most influential movies ever made. The most respected poll of such things, conducted every decade by the British Film Institute\u2019s Sight & Sound magazine, asks the world\u2019s leading directors and critics to name the 100 greatest films of all time. The last BFI decadal survey, conducted in 2012, placed it at No. 2 among directors and No. 6 among critics. Not bad for a film that critic Pauline Kael had waited a contemptuous 10 months before dismissing as \u201ctrash masquerading as art\u201d in the pages of Harper\u2019s.  Although the film\u2019s vision of humanity expanding throughout the solar system proved overoptimistic, its portrait of a screen-based, technology-mediated future now seems almost uncannily accurate, and it devastatingly evokes the dehumanization that can result from such communication. As for the cyclopean HAL-9000 supercomputer, often considered the most human character in \u201c2001,\u201d it foreshadowed our anxious contemporary discussion about the potentially dystopian impact of artificial-intelligence technologies.  The film\u2019s extraordinary predictive realism was entirely premeditated, the result of Kubrick and Clarke\u2019s questing, cerebral commitment to scientific and technical accuracy. By all accounts the production was run less like a big-budget Hollywood production than an extended futurological R&D exercise. A broad slate of top aerospace and computer companies were brought on board as consultants and advisers, with such leading innovators as IBM , Bell Labs and Hewlett-Packard all playing important roles.  In the summer of 1965, Kubrick received two detailed Bell Labs reports written by A. Michael Noll (a trailblazer in the development of digital arts and 3-D animation) and information theorist John R. Pierce (who coined the term \u201ctransistor\u201d and headed the team that built the first communications satellite). They recommended that the spacecraft systems in \u201c2001\u201d all feature multiple \u201cfairly large, flat and rectangular\u201d screens, with \u201cno indication of the massive depth of equipment behind them.\u201d Flat screens were, of course, unknown in the \u201960s\u2014at least outside of movie theaters\u2014and they helped to ensure 2001\u2019s futuristic sheen.  The film featured forward-looking flat-screen tablet computers. Photo: Mary Evans/Everett Collection  The role of the film\u2019s sentient supercomputer, originally named Athena, grew throughout the film\u2019s development, under the influence of discussions that Kubrick and Clarke held with MIT cognitive scientist and artificial intelligence pioneer Marvin Minsky and British cryptologist and mathematician I. J. Good. The computer\u2019s physical look resulted from advice provided by IBM\u2019s influential design bureau-think-tank\u2014the Apple Industrial Design Group of its day\u2014then led by industrial designer Eliot Noyes.  In July 1965, Noyes and his team provided drawings of astronauts floating within a kind of \u201cbrain room\u201d\u2014a concept that Kubrick initially rejected but later recognized as having intriguing dramatic possibilities. The astronaut Dave Bowman\u2019s methodical lobotomization of the computer after it\u2014or rather, \u201che\u201d\u2014had killed off the rest of the crew, conducted within the dappled red confines of the film\u2019s remarkable brain-room set, remains one of the most powerfully disturbing scenes ever committed to celluloid.  HAL stood for \u201cHeuristic Algorithmic,\u201d a Minsky suggestion. The computer\u2019s homicidal tendencies emerged only gradually, forcing the production to remove its original IBM nameplate and to substitute another acronym\u2014a kind of subliminal cognate, with \u201cHAL\u201d being displaced from \u201cIBM\u201d by only one letter in each case, something that both Kubrick and Clarke strenuously denied was intentional.  Another fascinating result of the production\u2019s consultation with Big Blue was the film\u2019s forward-looking flat-screen tablet computers, which retained their IBM logos and were called \u201cNewspads.\u201d Constructed long before such technologies were feasible, the movie\u2019s seemingly portable Newspads were actually welded to the tables on which they appeared casually placed, with hidden 16mm film projectors recessed underneath to provide content for their frosted-glass displays.  In the film\u2019s final cut, the Newspads were only used by the astronauts to watch a TV program ostensibly from the BBC and were thus largely indistinguishable from the various other displays embedded in the sets. But the production had received permission from the New York Times to use its logo, and Kubrick\u2019s designers had mocked up a digital front page for the Newspads, complete with multiple story choices to be accessed by touch-screen command. If the page had been used, the movie would almost certainly now be seen as having predicted the internet.  More than four decades later, however, the predictive futurism of \u201c2001\u201d was decisively ratified when Apple released its first iPad in 2010. Samsung issued a similar device a year later, and Apple immediately sued for patent infringement. That August the Korean company filed a response in federal court in San Jose, Calif., asserting that Apple couldn\u2019t possibly have invented the iPad because the device had already been envisioned in \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey.\u201d  Samsung\u2019s unusual defense, which featured both stills and YouTube links from the film, was ultimately ruled inadmissible as evidence, but it confirmed what many fans have long appreciated: the continuing relevance and still-startling prescience of Kubrick\u2019s masterpiece.  \u2014Mr. Benson is the author of \u201cSpace Odyssey: Stanley Kubrick, Arthur Clarke and the Making of a Masterpiece,\u201d which will be published on April 3 by Simon & Schuster.", "stock": "IBM"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/proposed-technology-export-bill-would-go-way-too-far-1521230540", "label": -1, "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "date": "2018-03-16", "article": "Regarding Rep. Robert Pittenger\u2019s \u201cHow China Pushes the Limits on Military Technology Transfer\u201d (op-ed, March 14): Few Americans would argue against measures to make this country more secure, and most would agree that protecting national security requires the proper tools. Still, many more would agree that being factual when discussing this topic is absolutely critical.  Legislation recently introduced in Congress and advocated in these pages by Rep. Robert Pittenger would make some needed improvements to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (Cfius). For example, the measure would expand the ability of the government to block the purchase of buildings or other real estate near military installations.  But Mr. Pittenger\u2019s bill\u2014the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act\u2014goes much, much farther. It would drastically expand the mission of Cfius, an interagency committee staffed by fewer than a dozen people at the Treasury Department, bringing under government review countless international sales and licensing transactions by U.S. companies.  The new remit of Cfius would include such things as standard computer service and support contracts, technology manuals needed to operate machinery purchased by foreign customers and even the licensing of trademarks. Technologies that never were deemed sensitive by the Defense Department or that were long ago removed from control by the U.S. and its allies would be subject to new and opaque regulation by Cfius.  More concerning is that Mr. Pittenger\u2019s bill would do all of this unilaterally\u2014without any effort at cooperation with our allies. The U.S. does not have a monopoly on innovative technologies. Congress can impose all the restrictions it wants on U.S. businesses. But, if America does not work with allies to enact similar controls, we will fail to protect both national security and our economic competitiveness.  In making his case to expand Cfius, Rep. Pittenger has misrepresented the facts. He cites examples of technology sold overseas by IBM and other companies that the U.S. government itself long ago ruled were nonsensitive and able to be freely sold around the world without a government license. In fact, everything IBM has done globally complies with U.S. and foreign export-control laws. For instance, sharing widely published, open-source software, or technology to assemble computer servers that are years behind state of the art, isn\u2019t threatening and therefore not legally controlled for export. But assisting with China\u2019s high-performance computing project is rightly prohibited by U.S. law, and the assertion that IBM has done so is flatly untrue.  Instead of putting thousands of nonsensitive transactions under review by a small committee that has neither the staff nor the experience to handle them, the better approach would be to update the export-control system we already have. A bipartisan bill introduced by Reps. Ed Royce and Eliot Engel, leaders of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, would modernize export controls to deal with emerging challenges.  Congress could also require that technology controls be kept up-to-date. The Departments of Commerce and State\u2014which are today responsible for administering controls on dual-use and military technologies\u2014have between them 500 experts, a transparent process of licensing and deep technical knowledge. But the Militarily Critical Technologies List, mandated by Congress as the baseline for what to control, hasn\u2019t been updated by the Defense Department since 2011.  As recent history has shown, controlling sensitive technology works best when done internationally, with a sharp focus on those technologies that are the most critical. Casting too broad a net on routine business risks losing focus on the real threats. Creating a new bureaucracy, instead of modernizing the one we already have, would be misguided.  Rep. Pittenger should get his facts straight. And Congress should act, both to improve Cfius and to update export controls, but it should use the proper tools for the proper job.  Christopher Padilla  IBM  Washington  Mr. Padilla is vice president for government and regulatory affairs at IBM. He was assistant secretary of commerce responsible for export controls from 2006-2007.  Rep. Pittenger\u2019s piece is premised on inaccurate claims about GE that undermine his arguments to reform government oversight of foreign acquisitions. We are a 125-year-old American company that has worked closely with the U.S. government and military for decades. Rep. Pettinger\u2019s insinuation that GE would compromise our national security to do business in China is offensive and untrue. While we, like many global companies, have joint ventures in China, all of them are consistent with U.S. law, and in many instances were established in close consultation with the U.S. government.  Rep. Pittenger never contacted GE to fact-check his allegations. In truth, GE supports Cfius reform, including strengthening the federal resources devoted to reviews of inbound investments and focusing the review on sectors of highest priority. What we don\u2019t support is the expansion of Cfius\u2019s jurisdiction to outbound U.S. investments into joint ventures around the world (not just in China). Doing so would set back both U.S. national security and economic interests, creating a new bureaucracy that is completely redundant with the existing U.S. export control system. It would generate thousands of additional cases for an already underresourced Cfius system, reduce the likelihood of a coordinated approach with our closest allies and needlessly damage American companies and their workers seeking to compete abroad.  Unfounded attacks like those made by Rep. Pittenger are unhelpful to the complex challenge the U.S. faces in safeguarding sensitive U.S. technology while enabling companies to compete in global markets.

Fourth-quarter revenue rose 3.6% to $22.54 billion. The last time IBM had revenue growth from the prior year was the first quarter of 2012, Ms. Rometty\u2019s first as chief.  Several factors drove growth in the latest quarter: sales of industrial-strength computers\u2014which the company typically refreshes every few years\u2014 rose 32% to $3.33 billion, while cloud-computing revenue climbed 30% to $5.5 billion. Also, currency exchange rates have been working in IBM\u2019s favor lately, accounting for 3 percentage points of the quarter\u2019s revenue growth after years of being a headwind.  IBM said it took a $5.5 billion charge related to the new U.S. tax law, helping to push it into the red for the period. Its tax rate, excluding the charge but including certain one-time benefits, was 6%.  In all, the company reported a fourth-quarter loss of $1.05 billion, or $1.14 a share, compared with profit of $4.5 billion, or $4.72 a share, a year earlier.  The loss stemmed partly from a deep erosion in profits in IBM\u2019s services business, showing IBM still has work to do. Pretax profit margins in the two services segments that manage large companies\u2019 software and hardware needs sank 35% and 23%, respectively, from a year ago. In its conference call with analysts, IBM described high investments and \u201clarge contract dynamics\u201d in those businesses.  Since becoming CEO, Ms. Rometty has struggled to shift IBM from older, shrinking businesses, such as selling and maintaining equipment in customers\u2019 own facilities, to newer ones that promise rapid growth.  She has staked out a position in helping large corporate customers integrate their traditional operations with cloud computing, and has focused on buzzy areas such as artificial intelligence and the Internet-based ledger technology known as blockchain.  But growth has been elusive, as even high-profile initiatives\u2014such as IBM\u2019s Watson AI, a collection of cloud tools as well as apps for industries including medicine and finance\u2014haven\u2019t delivered a clear financial boost.  Even some of Ms. Rometty\u2019s biggest fans have lost patience. IBM\u2019s largest and arguably most prominent stakeholder\u2014Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which invested more than $10 billion for a 5.4% stake in 2011\u2014sold more than half its holdings last year. Berkshire held about 37 million shares as of Sept. 30.  Shares of the 106-year-old tech company dropped 3.1% in after-hours trading after finishing Thursday\u2019s regular session with a marginal gain at $169.12. The price stands roughly where it did a year ago, while the S&P 500 index has risen more than 23%.  While achieving quarterly growth is noteworthy, IBM is working toward what it sees as a more significant milestone: getting more than half its revenue from so-called strategic imperatives \u2014 mostly newer technologies such as AI that customers can access in the cloud.  Revenue from strategic imperatives made up 49% of the total in the quarter, edging toward the point at which sales of the higher-growth offerings will outweigh the rest of IBM, heralding faster growth overall.  In an interview, James Kavanaugh, IBM\u2019s new finance chief, said the company is \u201cahead of track\u201d in working toward its goal of hitting an annual revenue rate of $40 billion for strategic imperatives by the end of this year.  \u201cThat gives us the confidence to say we\u2019re going to grow revenue overall in 2018,\u201d he said.  Jim Lebenthal, a portfolio manager at HPM Partners LLC, said there is evidence of Ms. Rometty\u2019s progress. He shed IBM in 2015 after \u201ca lot of disappointments\u201d but recently added the company to his stable of 20 stocks. He is betting IBM\u2019s newfound revenue growth is sustainable and that strategic imperatives will grow to more than 50% of sales in 2018.  When Ms. Rometty took the CEO reins from Samuel Palmisano in January 2012, revenue started slipping almost immediately and the threat of cloud computing to IBM\u2019s traditional businesses became evident. Ms. Rometty purchased cloud-computing platform SoftLayer Technologies Inc. the following year and committed to developing Watson into a flagship offering.  By 2014, it was clear IBM had diverged from Mr. Palmisano\u2019s financial road map for $20-a-share in profit by 2015. Ms. Rometty set aside that goal, reorganized the company around her strategic imperatives and redirected about $4 billion away from stock repurchases toward priorities such as Watson and the cloud, according to UBS AG analyst Steven Milunovich.  IBM\u2019s challenges now include holding on to its large customers as cloud leaders such as Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google beckon.  \u201cStrategic imperative revenue may cross over the core franchises later this year,\u201d Mr. Milunovich said, \u201cbut there are a lot of industry trends working against a large incumbent like IBM.\u201d  Hardware revenue rose 32%, driven by sales of mainframe computers\u2014on IBM\u2019s conference call with analysts, former finance chief Martin Schroeter called mainframes \u201can enduring and growing franchise\u201d\u2014which accounted for nearly 15% of total revenue in the quarter.  Those sales are critical, as they drive related sales of support services, software, storage and financing that historically have made up roughly 40% of IBM\u2019s operating profit, according to analyst Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein Research. They also can cement long-term customer relationships that drive recurring revenue such as software subscriptions, he said.  On an adjusted basis, which omits such items as acquisition- and retirement-related charges, IBM had profit of $5.18 a share, a penny more than the $5.17 expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters.  The Armonk, N.Y., company\u2019s guidance for 2018 called for operating earnings of $13.80 a share and free cash flow of about $12 billion.

IBM -0.86% is scheduled to announce fourth-quarter earnings after the market closes Thursday. Here\u2019s what to look for:  EARNINGS FORECAST: Analysts expect IBM to report earnings of $5.17 a share on an adjusted basis, which typically omits items such as acquisition- and retirement-related charges, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters. A year ago, IBM reported $5.01 in adjusted profit.  REVENUE FORECAST: Analysts expect total revenue of $22.05 billion for the quarter, up 1.3% from $21.77 billion a year earlier\u2014what would be the first growth after 22 consecutive quarters of declines.  WHAT TO WATCH:  GROWTH, BUT FOR HOW LONG?: One quarter of growth after more than five years of declines doesn\u2019t make a trend, some analysts caution. Fourth-quarter revenue was bolstered by two key factors, they say. First, foreign-exchange rates lately have shifted in IBM\u2019s favor after years of cutting into financial performance. They likely accounted for roughly 3% of revenue in the quarter, said Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein Research. Second, Q4 was the first full period that included sales of IBM\u2019s latest industrial-strength computers that process transactions for retailers, banks and the like. The mainframes, which IBM typically introduces every few years, typically boost revenue across several business lines. That effect is cyclical and bound to taper after a few quarters, Mr. Sacconaghi said.  SERVICES AHEAD: Knowing an eventual drop-off in mainframe revenue is down the line, investors will be looking for other areas to pick up the slack. IBM\u2019s two services segments, which include its consulting, IT hardware and software services and cloud operations, typically account for roughly 65% of total revenue. Both declined in recent quarters. \u201cFor IBM to get to revenue stability, which is what really matters for the stock multiple, services have to improve,\u201d said David Grossman of Stifel Financial Corp.  TAX IMPACT: Analysts are struggling to evaluate precisely how the U.S. tax-reform bill recently passed by Congress will affect IBM. The company has said its aggregate tax rate is around 15%, plus or minus 3 percentage points, but some analysts believe the new law may push it as high as 20%. The company held around $71 billion in cash overseas at the end of 2016, said Steve Milunovich of UBS AG , and repatriating some of that money could eat into earnings. IBM hasn\u2019t yet said what it expects to do with its stockpile in light of the new U.S. tax law.

The Senate and House, with the backing of the White House, are working on bipartisan legislation to broaden the authority of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., a multi-agency body that has oversight of deals that could lead to the transfer of sensitive technology to rival countries. The current CFIUS statute doesn\u2019t single out any country, but in recent years, the committee has often been focused on deals involving China.  Currently, CFIUS can recommend the president block foreign entities from buying majority stakes in U.S. companies; the new bill would let the committee make similar recommendations for deals involving minority investments and joint ventures, along with transactions that it determines involve \u201cemerging technologies.\u201d  The scope of the proposed legislation is broad. China requires foreign investors to form ventures with local partners, and Washington law firms say they are receiving a surge in inquiries over what it might mean for the large number of U.S. firms active in China. The country\u2019s huge size has made it a market of interest for companies ranging from auto makers like General Motors Corp. , technology companies like Cisco Systems Inc. or other manufacturers like Caterpillar Inc. \u2014all of which have local ventures in China.  It isn\u2019t clear how broadly the new law would be enforced. For now, the most vocal corporate opponents are a handful of U.S. companies that have determined the new law might crimp business prospects by requiring companies to get the blessing of CFIUS for some joint ventures that involve shared U.S. technology.  IBM Corp. , for instance, last year agreed with China\u2019s Wanda Internet Technology to share the cloud computing technology used in its Watson artificial intelligence system. Behind the strategy is the belief that embedding IBM\u2019s technology in China\u2019s business infrastructure would steer Chinese customers toward IBM as they seek future growth.  Other large U.S. corporations, from General Electric Co. to Microsoft Corp. , see China as a crucial market for similar reasons.  IBM, among others, has said the bill\u2014known as the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act\u2014would hurt U.S. companies\u2019 ability to compete globally. \u201cForeign competitors that do not face similar regulatory restrictions will seize global market opportunities while American companies are left watching from the sidelines,\u201d IBM\u2019s vice president of government and regulatory affairs, Christopher Padilla, testified at a recent Senate hearing.  Supporters of the bill, who think it could be signed into law later this year, aren\u2019t convinced. \u201cI am concerned that some of the recent witnesses before the House and Senate have major financial conflicts of interest that prohibit an objective evaluation of the security threats we face,\u201d Rep. Robert Pittenger (R., N.C.)\u2014one of the drafters of the bill\u2014said in an email.  \u201cThe business models for IBM, Microsoft, and GE, for example, have led to the transfer of military applicable technologies to China that have likely aided the modernization of the Chinese military and intelligence agencies,\u201d said Mr. Pittenger. The bill\u2019s supporters say it complements and strengthens export regulations rather than duplicating them.  IBM and other opponents, while acknowledging national-security concerns, have suggested existing export controls to counter China rather than expanding the reach of CFIUS. IBM didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.  In an email, GE said while it supports the idea of changes to CFIUS, \u201cit\u2019s also important that any reform support America\u2019s historical leadership in attracting foreign investment, not duplicate existing and well-established export control regimes, and preserve the ability of American companies to compete globally.\u201d The company declined an interview. Microsoft declined to comment.  Several security experts say China has been sidestepping controls by taking minority stakes in U.S. technology companies or entering joint licensing ventures.  \u201cThere\u2019s a very sophisticated and well-organized plan [by China] to acquire the technology and the reality is there are people here who want to sell it,\u201d said William Reinsch, who was the Commerce Department\u2019s undersecretary for export administration under President Bill Clinton.  And for many who have watched China easily avail itself of gaps in the CFIUS review process, the bill is the minimum that can be done in a fight that is likely to get much bigger. CFIUS blocked 10 deals between 2014 and 2016 over national-security concerns; China in recent years has accounted for the largest number of reviewed transactions.  \u201cThere\u2019s a big trade war shootout coming up with China that I think, frankly, is overdue,\u201d said Adm. Dennis Blair, co-chair of the Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property and a former U.S. director of national intelligence. He said among the key technologies right now are those involving artificial intelligence, data mining and pattern recognition.  How Bill Would Broaden CFIUS\u2019s Reach Expands CFIUS\u2019s jurisdiction to partnerships where a foreign firm doesn\u2019t have a controlling interest, such as joint ventures, minority investments and licensing deals.  Adds ability to review real-estate purchases or leases near military bases or other sensitive U.S. government properties.

Tianjin Haiguang didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.  AMD spokesman Drew Prairie said in an email that \u201csome commentators have mischaracterized\u201d the venture and that AMD received a \u201cU.S. government classification confirming that the technology was not restricted for export\u201d\u2014a reference to Commerce Department export controls. As for the CFIUS overhaul bill, Mr. Prairie said AMD supports strengthened security but wants to make sure it doesn\u2019t have \u201cunintended consequences.\u201d Dawning Information Industry Co. , the largest shareholder of Tianjin Haiguang, didn\u2019t respond to an email.  Many businesses are also supportive of the bill, including software maker Oracle Corp. , telecommunications firm Ericsson Inc., steelmaker Nucor Corp. and railroad-car-equipment maker Greenbrier Co s. Many say an expanded CFIUS would set needed ground rules for working with Chinese firms.  Even openly supporting the bill, some companies worry, could expose them to problems\u2014not in the U.S. but in China. They don\u2019t want to be blocked from entering deals in China, or prevented from selling products in its booming economy.  \u201cWe\u2019re quiet about our support because of fear of retaliation,\u201d said an executive at a large U.S. technology company.  \u2014Kersten Zhang and Ted Greenwald contributed to this article.

One employee planning to depart\u2014a 47-year-old who has been with the car maker for a decade\u2014said Peugeot is offering him \u20ac10,500 ($12,950) to retrain. He wants to become a teacher.  \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten to a point where the company is no longer right for me, and I\u2019m no longer right for the company,\u201d he said. \u201cBetter a good divorce than a bad marriage.\u201d  Mr. Macron\u2019s approach could backfire, however, if companies use the new measures to cut staff without hiring new ones. France\u2019s economy is finally in recovery, with latest figures showing unemployment at the end of 2017 at 8.9%, its lowest level since early 2009. But Mr. Macron remains under pressure to bring that rate down further, and the country\u2019s powerful unions have their guard up against any evidence that the rules could cost jobs rather than create them.  Foreign businesses that have typically viewed France as a sinkhole for investment are also watching closely. Labor lawyers in Paris are already fielding calls from firms in the U.S. and elsewhere that \u201care interested in the possibility of moving fast in a consensual framework that isn\u2019t traumatic for their teams,\u201d said Claire Toumieux, a partner at law firm Allen & Overy.  IBM, based in Armonk, New York, plans to \u201chire aggressively in key skills areas\u201d in France in parallel to conducting layoffs using the new rules, a company spokeswoman said.  In September, Mr. Macron decreed myriad changes, including capping court-ordered fines for dismissals and giving companies greater powers to negotiate working conditions with employees. One part of the broad package is a measure that absolves companies from using lengthy, complex procedures for voluntary layoffs.  A broken window at a Paris branch of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale after a march in November against the French government\u2019s overhaul of labor laws. Photo: Michel Stoupak/NurPhoto/ZUMA Press  Previously a firm had to prove it was in financial difficulty before embarking on layoffs, even on a voluntary basis. Publicly traded firms were loath to declare they were struggling. Penalties for missteps in the procedure were high, and a company could ultimately be forced to hire back staff who left.  The new rules allow employers to instead negotiate a rupture conventionnelle collective\u2014a voluntary severance agreement for large numbers of employees\u2014regardless of the company\u2019s health.  \u201cIt\u2019s a complete change in philosophy,\u201d said David Jonin, a partner specializing in employment law at Gide Loyrette Nouel.  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale plans to use the measure to restructure its retail operations. As customers shift to online services, the bank is scrambling to close 300 of its 2,000 retail branches in France and automate 80% of the processes linking front and back offices. The plan, dubbed \u201cTransform to Grow,\u201d will entail 3,450 job cuts from its retail network between 2016 and 2020, the bank said in November.  Many of those cuts were expected to take place through attrition or the redeployment of staff to other units of the bank, but last month the bank disclosed it would also make use of the new rules.  Balancing Act Peugeot is using President Macron's labor measures to slash jobs this year and soften the blow with new recruits. 3,000 Apprentices 2,000 2,000 1,000 New hires  1,300  0  Layoffs  \u20131,000  1,300  Early  retirement  \u20132,000  900  \u20133,000  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale has scheduled talks with unions for later this month. Under the Macron law, any firm that wants to adopt the new scheme needs to win over a majority of its union representatives. In some cases that has emerged as a significant obstacle.  \u201cManagement is going too fast. When you want to get rid of so many jobs, you\u2019ve got to explain why,\u201d said Monique Motsch, a representative of the moderate CFDT union at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.  At French clothing retailer Pimkie, unions already shot down a Jan. 9 proposal to apply the new process, forcing the company to revert to France\u2019s older, more onerous system requiring the firm to show itself as being in financial distress.  Peugeot, in contrast, secured the support of its unions in a matter of days. The car maker threaded the needle by sweetening the layoff offers and combining them with 900 early-retirement offers and a plan to recruit and train higher-skilled employees. That includes 1,300 new positions and 2,000 apprentices.  \u201cPsychologically it\u2019s softer. There\u2019s no obligation to leave, everything is voluntary and it protects workers who want to stay,\u201d said Jean-Francois Kondratiuk, an employee representative who sits on Peugeot\u2019s supervisory board.  Workers who choose to stay at Peugeot are accepting more flexibility. Jean-Louis Thirot, 50, has agreed to train for a new job testing software for car electronics. The research center in the west of Paris where he currently works ordering parts is shutting down this year.  \u201cI\u2019m able to succeed because I can move internally,\u201d said Mr. Thirot, who has worked for Peugeot for more than three decades.  Others say they have recognized that a job at Peugeot is no longer the safe bet it once was. A 40-year-old technician whose father, brother and wife have all worked for the car maker said he thought he had a job for life when he joined the company in 2003. Now that Peugeot has outsourced nearly all of his department\u2019s work, he has decided to take the severance package.  \u201cI\u2019m the last of the Mohicans,\u201d he said.

Robert Pittenger\u2019s \u201cHow China Pushes the Limits on Military Technology Transfer\u201d (WSJ.com op-ed, March 14): Few Americans would argue against measures to make this country more secure, and most would agree that protecting national security requires the proper tools. Still, many more would agree that being factual when discussing this topic is absolutely critical.  Legislation recently introduced in Congress and advocated in these pages by Rep. Robert Pittenger would make some needed improvements to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (Cfius). For example, the measure would expand the ability of the government to block the purchase of buildings or other real estate near military installations.  But Mr. Pittenger\u2019s bill\u2014the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act\u2014goes much, much farther. It would drastically expand the mission of Cfius, an interagency committee staffed by fewer than a dozen people at the Treasury Department, bringing under government review countless international sales and licensing transactions by U.S. companies.  The new remit of Cfius would include such things as standard computer service and support contracts, technology manuals needed to operate machinery purchased by foreign customers and even the licensing of trademarks. Technologies that never were deemed sensitive by the Defense Department or that were long ago removed from control by the U.S. and its allies would be subject to new and opaque regulation by Cfius.  More concerning is that Mr. Pittenger\u2019s bill would do all of this unilaterally\u2014without any effort at cooperation with our allies. The U.S. does not have a monopoly on innovative technologies. Congress can impose all the restrictions it wants on U.S. businesses. But, if America does not work with allies to enact similar controls, we will fail to protect both national security and our economic competitiveness.  In making his case to expand Cfius, Rep. Pittenger has misrepresented the facts. He cites examples of technology sold overseas by IBM and other companies that the U.S. government itself long ago ruled were nonsensitive and able to be freely sold around the world without a government license. In fact, everything IBM has done globally complies with U.S. and foreign export-control laws. For instance, sharing widely published, open-source software, or technology to assemble computer servers that are years behind state of the art, isn\u2019t threatening and therefore not legally controlled for export. But assisting with China\u2019s high-performance computing project is rightly prohibited by U.S. law, and the assertion that IBM has done so is flatly untrue.  Instead of putting thousands of nonsensitive transactions under review by a small committee that has neither the staff nor the experience to handle them, the better approach would be to update the export-control system we already have. A bipartisan bill introduced by Reps. Ed Royce and Eliot Engel, leaders of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, would modernize export controls to deal with emerging challenges.  Congress could also require that technology controls be kept up-to-date. The Departments of Commerce and State\u2014which are today responsible for administering controls on dual-use and military technologies\u2014have between them 500 experts, a transparent process of licensing and deep technical knowledge. But the Militarily Critical Technologies List, mandated by Congress as the baseline for what to control, hasn\u2019t been updated by the Defense Department since 2011.  As recent history has shown, controlling sensitive technology works best when done internationally, with a sharp focus on those technologies that are the most critical. Casting too broad a net on routine business risks losing focus on the real threats. Creating a new bureaucracy, instead of modernizing the one we already have, would be misguided.  Rep. Pittenger should get his facts straight. And Congress should act, both to improve Cfius and to update export controls, but it should use the proper tools for the proper job.

One of the most important such lenses is the impact of IT on business processes, that is, on how work is actually done across the various functions of an organization.  IT-driven business process has gone through three distinct phases. First came process automation in the early years of IT, where companies automated and improved their existing processes while leaving the underlying structure of the organization in place. Then came enterprise-wide process reengineering and management, where the job was to redesign the flow of work and integrate management of the various process within the enterprise. The third phase is now starting, focused on the processes and transactions that determine how institutions interact with each other around the world. Here, blockchain is set to play a role.  Automation, reengineering and integrated management of business processes have had a major impact on lowering the costs and improving the efficiency of transactions within a firm. But as we well know, the internet and globalization have significantly increased the volume of transactions and other interactions taking place among institutions around the world. The processes to manage the conduct of business among companies have not kept up with the economy\u2019s digital transformation, adding significant frictions and costs to their operations.  According to a 2016 IBM report, three major types of frictions predominate when conducting business among different institutions:  Information frictions: Participants in a transaction don\u2019t have access to the same information; the required information is not easily accessible; and security and privacy risks keep rising, \u2013 e.g., hacking, cybercrime, identity theft.  Interaction frictions: Intermediaries are needed to help deal with growing scale and complexity; transactions take longer due to arcane global processes; and a lack of trusted marketplaces in many economies around the world.  Innovation frictions: These include legacy systems, bureaucratic processes and institutional inertia; restrictive regulations that stifle innovation and change; and growing uncertainties and threats that make it harder to move forward.  Blockchains have the potential to significantly reduce these various frictions by bringing one of the most important and oldest concepts, the ledger, to the internet age. Ledgers constitute a permanent record of all the economic transactions an institution handles, whether it\u2019s a bank managing deposits, loans and payments; a brokerage house keeping track of stocks and bonds; a global company conducting business with its supply chain partners; or a government office recording births and deaths, the ownership and sale of land and houses, or legal identity documents like passports and driver licenses.  \u201cToday, transactions are recorded in multiple ledgers,\u201d noted the IBM report. \u201cEach one captures at best a moment in time and reflects the information held by a single party: Bank X purchased or sold a mortgage, for example. They don\u2019t record what happens next, what came before, or the role of others \u2013 partners, suppliers, consumers \u2013 in the transaction. Moreover, they\u2019re prone to human error and vulnerable to tampering. By contrast, distributed ledgers can be shared and updated in near real-time across a group of participants.\u201d  Blockchain technologies hold great promise for global supply chains ecosystems by increasing the speed, security and accuracy of financial and commercial settlements; tracking the supply chain lifecycle of any component or product; and securely protecting all the transactions and data moving through the supply chain. Blockchains provide an immutable, non-revocable record of all the transactions through the entire supply chain cycle, which will be of great help in the timely resolution of errors or disputes among supply chain partners.  In August, 2016 the World Economic Forum published an excellent report on The future of financial infrastructure, an ambitious look at how blockchain can reshape financial services. The report noted that blockchain technologies have the potential to transform the infrastructure and processes of the financial industry, bringing a diverse range of benefits including operational simplification, near-real time settlements among institutions, more accurate regulatory compliance and liquidity and capital improvements.  However, the report also warned that the evolution towards such a blockchain-based financial infrastructure and processes will take considerable time because it must overcome significant challenges. In particular, it will require the close collaborations of its various stakeholders around the world \u2014 including financial institutions, merchants and governments\u2013to develop the appropriate legal and regulatory frameworks.  This emerging third phase in the evolution of business process transformation is both promising and challenging, as we once more apply IT to make economies more efficient, this time involving the interactions of institutions and industries all around the world.

Photo: Akos Stiller/Bloomberg News  Nvidia NVDA -1.32% may have only high-quality problems these days, but it still needs to solve them.  One problem the chip maker has is that it seems to be selling all the chips it can make. Nvidia\u2019s graphics processors, also called GPUs, are in hot demand by everyone from giant tech companies building data centers to videogamers to cryptocurrency enthusiasts. The latter two in particular are competing for the type of GPU cards used in supercharged PCs, causing a shortage that began last summer but seemed to have worsened later in the year as the value of cryptocurrencies continued to soar.  That gave a boost to what was already a strong year for Nvidia. Revenue from the company\u2019s gaming segment jumped 33% to a record $5.5 billion for the fiscal year ended Jan. 28. This included an unspecified contribution from crypto demand, as well as the chips the company sells to Nintendo that are used in its popular Switch console. Nvidia is a \u201cfabless\u201d chip company that outsources the actual manufacturing of its chips to others. CEO Jensen Huang said on the company\u2019s earnings call Thursday that it is working with its partners to \u201ccatch up to that demand.\u201d The recently ended fiscal year was the company\u2019s best ever. Sales jumped 41% to a record $9.7 billion, while operating income surged 66% to $3.2 billion\u2014another record. The company\u2019s operating margin for the year was also at a record high 33%, compared with 28% the previous year. Data center sales, representing chips sold to companies such as Google, Amazon and Microsoft to establish artificial intelligence capabilities in their networks, more than doubled during the year. That means Nvidia\u2019s main \u201cproblem\u201d for the year ahead is how to improve on perfection. Chances are that it can. Capital spending on data centers is expected to continue growing in the double-digit range this year. Gaming demand will remain strong as well, particularly with Nintendo boosting production of the Switch. Crypto is a wild card, with the value of those currencies swinging wildly of late, but Nvidia is wisely cautious about those customers, maintaining its focus on its gamer base and the burgeoning data center opportunity. Still, the company has a lot to live up to. Its stock defied Friday\u2019s turbulence to pick up 7% after already having surged nearly 90% in the previous 12 months. Nvidia\u2019s market value is now ahead of that of IBM \u2019s , with the shares fetching 37 times forward earnings. High expectations can set up disappointments down the road. Still, there are worse problems to have.

IBM is one of the big tech companies exploring ethical standards to guide the development of artificial intelligence. Photo: brian snyder/Reuters  WASHINGTON\u2014Technology companies are racing to get ahead of regulators to shape the future of artificial intelligence as it moves deeper into our daily lives.  Companies are already working artificial intelligence, or AI, into their business models, but the technology remains controversial. So IBM Corp. , Intel Corp. and associations representing Apple Inc., Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google unit are seeking to set ethical standards, or a sort of code of conduct, through alliances with futurists, civil-rights activists and social scientists.  Critics, however, see it as an effort to blunt outside regulation by cities, states or the federal government, and they question if tech companies are best suited to shape the rules of the road. For the corporations, the algorithms will be proprietary tools to assess your loan-worthiness, your job application, and your risk of stroke. Many balk at the costs of developing systems that not only learn to make decisions, but that also explain those decisions to outsiders.  When New York City proposed a law in August requiring that companies publish source code for algorithms used by city agencies, tech firms pushed back, saying they needed to protect proprietary algorithms. The city passed a scaled-back version in December without the source-code requirement.  \u201cThey\u2019re hiding behind trade secrets so you can\u2019t even get a look at what people are doing,\u201d said Ryan Calo, a University of Washington law professor who has advised Congress members on AI issues.  AI, broadly speaking, refers to computers mimicking intelligent behavior, crunching big data to make judgments on anything from avoiding car accidents to where the next crime might happen.  Yet computer algorithms aren\u2019t always clear on their logic. If a computer consistently denies a loan to members of a certain sex or race, is that discrimination? Will regulators have the right to examine the algorithm that made the decision? What if the algorithm doesn\u2019t know how to explain itself?  From the Archives Executives from Baidu, Intel, Samsung and Walmart talk about how artificial intelligence will soon redefine our technological lives. They speak at the WSJ D.Live conference in Laguna Beach, Calif. (Originally published Oct. 18, 2017)  The Obama administration sought to address these issues. Under Mr. Obama, the Office of Science and Technology Policy issued white papers on the ethical implications on AI. Under Mr. Trump, the office still doesn\u2019t have a director, and its staff is down to about 45, from about 130. A spokesman for the office declined to comment.  For now, the Trump administration has signaled it wants business to take the lead. The administration is worried overarching regulation could constrain innovation and make the U.S. less competitive, Michael Kratsios, the deputy in charge of tech policy at the Office of Science and Technology Policy, said at a conference in February. He noted China\u2019s push into artificial intelligence, which it is doing without much ethical quibbling.  \u201cWe\u2019re not looking for, or will be endorsing, broad, high level guidelines about AI rules,\u201d Mr. Kratsios said. He called it \u201ckey\u201d to create \u201cthe regulatory environment that ensures that the next great technologies happen here in the U.S.\u201d  In the past six months, Intel, IBM, Workday Inc. and the Washington, D.C.-based Information Technology Industry Council\u2014whose members include Facebook, Apple and Google\u2014all issued principles on the ethical use of artificial intelligence. In January, Microsoft Corp. put out an entire book on \u201cArtificial Intelligence and its Role in Society.\u201d  In 2016, some of the biggest tech companies founded an ethics-setting organization called the Partnership on Artificial Intelligence to Benefit People and Society, based in San Francisco. There are many others with at least some industry funding, including Open AI, the AI Now Institute, doteveryone, and the Center for Democracy & Technology.  Proposed rules have ranged from specific guidelines for government use, to requirements that any algorithm be able to explain its process to consumers. Many would apply existing regulations to AI case-by-case, adapting aviation rules to drones or applying privacy protections to personal data in algorithms.  Setting rules is complicated because companies often can\u2019t explain how their more complex systems, called \u201cdeep neural networks,\u201d arrive at answers. Last year, University of Washington researchers reported that an algorithm that had learned\u2014by itself\u2014to distinguish between wolves and husky dogs appeared to be doing so by noticing snow on the ground in the wolf pictures, not because of any insight into the animal.  \u201cGoogle, Facebook, those guys are very interested in performance and making these programs as smart as they can,\u201d said Dave Gunning, who leads a project into making algorithms explain their processes for the government\u2019s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.  \u201cExplainability is not as important to them,\u201d Mr. Gunning said. Google and Facebook didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.  At least one business executive, Elon Musk, founder and chief executive of Tesla Inc. and SpaceX, has cut back his role in the ethical research group he co-founded, Open AI. Mr. Musk quit the group\u2019s board in February. The group said he wanted to \u201celiminate a potential future conflict of interest\u201d with his role at Tesla, which is developing AI systems. He remains an Open AI adviser and funder.  Some in Congress are taking up the ethical debate. Washington Sen. Maria Cantwell and Maryland Rep. John Delaney, both Democrats, led a bipartisan bill introduced in December to establish a federal advisory council on the technology\u2019s potential impact. There is also an AI caucus on the Hill, started in may, and committees have been holding hearings on AI, algorithms and autonomous vehicles. The European Union has already set regulations for AI algorithms, that are set to take effect in May.  Human-resources software maker Workday, which uses Ai algorithms, assumes that either now, or sometime soon, the U.S. will start to set guidelines.  \u201cOur engagement now is in anticipation that one day there will be government regulation related to AI,\u201d said senior vice president Jim Shaughnessy. He said Workday wants to \u201censure a regulatory framework that serves society\u2019s needs while allowing the potential of AI, and its benefits, to flourish.\u201d", "stock": "IBM"}, {"url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-robot-revolution-humanoid-potential-moving-upstream-1517221862", "label": -1, "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "date": "2018-01-29", "article": "Humanoid robots are getting better at walking, talking and looking like humans.

Oxford Economics, a forecasting and consulting firm, estimates the legislation will contribute 0.4 percentage points to already-robust economic growth in 2018, and another 0.1 to 0.2 points in 2019, said Gregory Daco, head of U.S. economics for the consultancy.  About half of that is likely to come from business spending, and the rest from households, Mr. Daco said. Oxford estimates that each $1 of corporate tax cut will lead to 40 cents of spending, based on historical precedent, Congressional Budget Office studies and conversations with corporate executives.  That\u2019s mostly a one-time gain. A reduction in taxes frees up profits to spend, but that then becomes the new normal, with further growth coming from general economic expansion or other factors.  At Amicus Therapeutics, the new tax law solved a geographic dilemma. The Cranbury, N.J., company is developing an experimental drug to treat Pompe disease, a rare inherited disorder that causes muscle weakness and can be fatal.  After early results for a new drug proved promising, Amicus wanted to increase production for further clinical testing and potential commercial sales.  Amicus, which has been using Chinese contract manufacturer WuXi Biologics to supply the drug, decided in August to build its own facility. The U.S. was at a disadvantage to Europe, due to its 35% statutory federal income-tax rate for companies. Ireland\u2019s corporate tax rate, by contrast, is 12.5%.  Those financial considerations threatened to overshadow other advantages that a U.S. plant would offer, including the ease with which company officials could visit it, and the availability of talented workers in some regions.  \u201cOur strong assumption was that it would be very challenging to establish a new bio-manufacturing facility in the U.S.,\u201d Chief Executive John Crowley said in an interview.  As the tax legislation advanced in Congress last fall, however, building in the U.S. began to look more attractive. On Dec. 21, a day after Congress passed the final measure, which lowered the statutory corporate rate to 21%, Mr. Crowley recommended to his board the company focus on finding a U.S. site. The company has narrowed its choice to three East Coast cities Mr. Crowley declined to identify, and expects to decide in the next month or two. It expects the plant to cost $150 million to $200 million, and to employ at least 200 people at an average pay of $100,000 a year.  Amicus Therapeutics Chief Executive John Crowley, right, chose the U.S. over Europe for a new production facility. Photo: Melissa Golden for The Wall Street Journal  \u201cWith the changes in the tax law, it now makes the U.S. competitive with these geographies we\u2019re looking at,\u201d he said.  The rules of deal making, too, are changing. In the past two months, Aramark completed two acquisitions with a price tag of $2.35 billion as it snapped up hotel procurement and supply firm Avendra in December and uniform-rental and linen-supply firm AmeriPride Services Inc. last week.  Both are a kind of deal that, thanks to the new tax law, has become cheaper. One provision lets companies deduct the cost of buying some sorts of assets immediately, instead of over several years as prior tax law required\u2014and expanded this treatment to used assets as well as new ones.  That essentially lets a buyer like Aramark get an immediate discount on the cash cost of part of its deals, the portion that reflects the acquisition of equipment, machinery and other tangible property.  Aramark\u2019s acquisition of Avendra, a partnership, is automatically treated as an asset purchase, New York tax consultant Robert Willens notes, while deal documents indicate Aramark and AmeriPride agreed to treat that acquisition as an asset purchase as well for tax purposes. (Although the Avendra deal closed in December, the new tax treatment applies to assets acquired after late September.)  \u201cThe cost of deals structured in this manner have taken a turn for the better,\u201d Mr. Willens said. \u201cYou\u2019re getting a full 21% discount.\u201d  In news releases, Aramark described its after-tax cost for the two deals as $1.86 billion, 21% less than the pretax price. Aramark said in a statement that it continues to evaluate the impact of the new tax law with accounting firm KPMG LLP, and plans to update investors on the acquisitions when it reports quarterly earnings on Feb. 6.  The same provision, speeding up tax deductions for capital spending, has prompted Kimberly-Clark, the diaper- and tissue-maker, to accelerate at least one major project, CEO Tom Falk said. The company\u2019s board votes next month on a U.S. factory retooling expected to cost hundreds of millions of dollars. There wasn\u2019t a timeline for the project previously.  \u201cIt gives us more incentive to invest, particularly in the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Falk said in an interview. \u201cThe project made sense before the tax benefit. It makes more sense after the tax benefit.\u201d  Similar reconsiderations are under way elsewhere. At United Natural Foods Inc., a grocery distributor with about 10,000 employees and more than $9 billion in annual revenue, the tax law has prompted a wholesale re-evaluation.  Projects previously viewed as risky are being given new consideration, Mike Zechmeister, the company\u2019s finance chief, said in an interview. The return on investment improved by 4 percentage points on a warehousing project in the Pacific region of the U.S. that the company had already decided to pursue, he said, primarily because of the new lower tax rate.  \u201cIt\u2019s going to impact all the decisions we make,\u201d Mr. Zechmeister said. \u201cAlmost all investments look better from an investment standpoint because we won\u2019t have to pay as much tax.\u201d  Grocery distributor United Natural Foods Inc. is investing to overcome capacity bottlenecks. Photo: United Natural Foods  The tax break comes at a particularly good time for United Natural Foods, which has struggled to keep pace with surging demand for natural and organic goods. The company\u2019s net sales rose 8% year-over-year during its last quarter to $2.5 billion, driven largely by Whole Foods, the chain acquired by Amazon.com Inc . last year and United Natural\u2019s biggest customer.  That sudden growth proved costly. The Providence, R.I., company had an additional $25 million in lost sales from out-of-stock goods during its last quarter, along with higher labor costs and storage fees. Any expansion would help ease capacity bottlenecks that the company intends to resolve in coming months.  Some companies are holding pat, either because they want to see how the new rules shake out, or because they are worried about moving too fast.  Verizon said it would use most of its tax savings\u2014$3.5 billion to $4 billion in extra cash in 2018\u2014to pay down some of its $117 billion debt, rather than increase investments. It will also donate to its charity and give employees company stock.  Mr. McAdam, the Verizon CEO, said the wireless giant would remain disciplined about capital spending. \u201cIt\u2019s very inconsistent that just because tax reform comes through, we are all of a sudden going to draw the line at a different place or lose that discipline,\u201d he said on Tuesday.  Several firms have announced plans to plow most of their tax savings into dividends or share repurchases, about a third of which flow to foreign investors, by some estimates.  Bank of America Corp. is exploring how it might invest in branches, technology and its workforce, CEO Brian Moynihan told investors last week. \u201cHowever, to be clear, we\u2019d expect most of the benefits from tax reform will flow to the bottom line through dividends and share buybacks over time,\u201d he added. A spokesman said payouts to shareholders will also help local economies.  The tax overhaul is altering corporate operations in sometimes surprising ways. Netflix Inc., for example, has changed the compensation it will pay three of its top officers, raising their salaries by a combined $19 million.  Its reasoning: The new tax law prevents companies from deducting any sort of pay over $1 million apiece for key executives. Prior law allowed companies to deduct that pay if it was tied to performance. So, having lost the benefit of a tax deduction for paying performance-based bonuses instead of salary, Netflix announced days after the tax law was passed that its board was scrapping the performance measures and converting the pay into straight salary instead, as it used to do before 2014.  The tax-law change is likely to eliminate tax deductions on $92 billion of pay, according to an analysis of Russell 3000 firms by Equilar. Several large companies\u2014including Johnson Controls International PLC and drugmaker AmerisourceBergen Corp. \u2014have said their boards are considering how the tax change affects their approach to compensation. Willis Towers Watson , a compensation-consulting firm, found that 40% of 333 employers it surveyed were either considering executive-pay changes or had already made some.  The ripple effects are hitting small businesses, too. Matthew Wells, president of Western Mechanical Contractors Inc. in Federal Way, Wash., is considering whether to restructure how his business is organized to maximize his benefits under the new tax law.  The 32-person plumbing and mechanical contracting firm is currently set up as an S corporation, a so-called pass-through structure in which the business itself isn\u2019t taxed and its income goes to the owners, who reflect it on their individual tax returns.  Mr. Wells is trying to determine whether his tax bill would fall if he switched to a C corporation, which pays its own income taxes directly to the Internal Revenue Service\u2014now at a 21% rate, down from a top rate of 35% before the new law.  Mr. Wells\u2019 accountant is still poring over the new law, but has suggested the potential benefits may not be as great as the contractor initially believed. \u201cI think they are going to try and talk us out of it,\u201d said Mr. Wells. \u201cBut it is certainly something we are looking into.\u201d  Christmas may be over but WSJ\u2019s Richard Rubin keeps the holiday spirit alive by explaining who\u2019s getting presents and who\u2019s getting coal with the GOP tax bill.  \u2014Sharon Terlep, Ruth Simon and Ryan Knutson contributed to this article.

AT&T is among the last large telecom companies looking to unload its platform of data centers. Photo: stephanie keith/Reuters  AT&T Inc. T -0.06% has reignited a sales process for its data-center business.  The telecom company has engaged Bank of America Corp. to explore a divestiture of its data centers, said people familiar with the matter.  The data-center business generates about $135 million of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, the people said. They said they expect the unit to garner an Ebitda multiple in the high-single-digit range\u2014roughly $1 billion or more\u2014based on the quality of the facilities.  AT&T previously had weighed a sale of its data-center and managed-hosting businesses with Citigroup Inc., some of the people said. Ultimately, it sold only the hosting business, which IBM Corp. purchased in 2015.  The Dallas wireless carrier is among the last large telecom companies looking to unload its platform of data centers\u2014facilities equipped with networked computers, storage devices and servers. Last year, Verizon Communications Inc. sold its portfolio of data centers to Equinix Inc. for $3.6 billion, while that same year CenturyLink Inc. sold its facilities for $2.3 billion to a consortium led by private-equity firm BC Partners. In 2015, Windstream Holdings Inc. divested its data-center business to TierPoint for $575 million.  AT&T is looking to sell the capital-intensive data centers to better focus on its core wireless and video businesses. The process is still ongoing, however, and may not result in a deal. The facilities will require investment and attention from prospective acquirers, said some of the people familiar with the business.  Shedding the data centers could give AT&T extra cash to pay down the cost of acquiring Time Warner Inc., if that deal materializes. The company offered $85 billion in cash and stock for the owner of HBO, CNN and other media assets before the federal government challenged the deal on antitrust grounds. A trial to decide the proposed merger\u2019s fate is slated to begin March 19.  AT&T is selling its data facilities as strong appetite from both cash-rich strategic buyers and new entrants like infrastructure firms, are driving up prices for such assets. The sector continues to expand rapidly as organizations consume larger amounts of data and outsource more information-technology services.  Private-equity firms, in particular, have played a big role in consolidating the data-center industry, drawn to its expansion trajectory and a contracts-driven business model that promises steady cash flow. Over the past decade, investors have successfully built platforms that today are part of bigger conglomerates.  Recent transactions in the sector include Iron Mountain Inc.\u2019s acquisition of IO Data Centers LLC for $1.34 billion, private equity-backed Peak 10 Inc.\u2019s acquisition of ViaWest Inc. for 2.3 billion Canadian dollars and Digital Realty Trust Inc.\u2019s purchase of DuPont Fabros Technology Inc. for $4.95 billion.  \u2014Drew FitzGerald contributed to this article.

The East African country, an important player on the continent in the U.S. war on terror, has been mired in political uncertainty after two fraught elections and bursts of violence.  In a news conference, President Uhuru Kenyatta and opposition leader Raila Odinga \u2014who has refused to concede the vote\u2014promised dialogue, and said they would soon roll out a specific path to reconciliation.  \u201cWe shall bring a process of bringing of our people together, and find out what really divides our nation,\u201d Mr. Kenyatta said. \u201cWe must bring together all our people where no single person is left behind.\u201d  Mr. Tillerson\u2019s arrival, after stops in Ethiopia and Djibouti, reflects Kenya\u2019s role as a top ally in combating al-Shabaab, the al Qaeda affiliate in Somalia. Nairobi is also home to regional headquarters to some major U.S. corporations like IBM , Google and Coca-Cola .  Mr. Tillerson congratulated the two men in a news conference in Nairobi later Friday, and he played down the U.S. role in the sudden reconciliation.  \u201cThe U.S. obviously has been very supportive of Kenya\u2019s journey moving forward after what\u2019s been a difficult election period,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was very important action on their part to show that they are ready to work on behalf of all Kenyans \u2026 all the credit goes to the two leaders this morning.\u201d  Ahead of the visit, a senior State Department official said the U.S. had extensively engaged with Mr. Odinga to bring about reconciliation.  \u201cWhat we said to him ... is that you have a really tremendous opportunity for historic times to really push forward political and economic reforms,\u201d said acting assistant Secretary of State for Africa Donald Yamamoto.  The U.S. diplomatic mission has been involved in attempting mediation as the political crisis deepened.  In the past few months, anti-U.S. sentiment has been on the rise. Opposition supporters saw U.S. recognition of Mr. Kenyatta as a partisan move, and protesters demonstrated outside the U.S. embassy earlier this year over what they called U.S. interference.  Unrest following the two elections led to dozens of fatalities and has reopened the ethnic rifts that in 2007 left more than 1,000 people dead in postelection violence.  Mr. Odinga, who represents a large swath of the population who feel cut off from the country\u2019s elite, has accused Mr. Kenyatta of being a dictator and declared himself the \u201cpeople\u2019s president.\u201d  On Friday he shook Mr. Kenyatta\u2019s hand and promised to \u201cend these differences.\u201d  \u201cWe need to save our children from ourselves,\u201d Mr. Odinga said.  The surprise moves comes amid an escalation of a standoff that started last year ahead of August presidential elections.  In a first for Africa, the outcome of those elections was annulled by the country\u2019s Supreme Court, which ruled they had been marred by irregularities. Mr. Odinga boycotted new elections in October. Only one in three Kenyans took part, and Mr. Kenyatta was re-elected to another 5-year term with 98% of the vote.  Kenya\u2019s economy, a pole for international investment where Chinese-built mega infrastructure like a $4-billion dollar railway runs alongside an equally ambitious highway being built by U.S. construction giant Bechtel, felt the pain of the prolonged crisis.  Its growth rate, previously among the continent\u2019s highest at above 6%, and multiple times the world average, slowed down to 4.8% in 2017, according to the International Monetary Fund.  The Kenyan shilling inched higher against the dollar soon after the joint statement by the two leaders.  Write to Matina Stevis-Gridneff at matina.stevis@wsj.com", "stock": "IBM"}]
