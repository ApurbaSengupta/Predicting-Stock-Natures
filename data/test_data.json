REUTERS/Mike Segar  Apple said it had appointed Oliver Schusser as vice president of Apple Music and international content. Schusser, who joined Apple 14 years ago, will report directly to Apple senior vice president Eddy Cue and will also oversee Apple\u2019s services outside the United States, including the App Store and iTunes.  Apple\u2019s top streaming music rival Spotify Technology SA has 71 million so-called premium subscribers, a figure that includes users who have given the company a credit card number for a free trial. Spotify became a public company earlier this month after holding a so-called direct listing on the New York Stock Exchange.  On a comparable basis, the Apple Music service has 48 million subscribers, 40 million of whom are paying subscribers and 8 million of whom are on a free trial, Apple said. Both firms charge $9.99 a month for streaming music but provide discounts for student and family plans.  Variety magazine earlier reported the new subscriber figures and Schusser\u2019s promotion. He previously built up Apple\u2019s services businesses outside the U.S. in 155 markets, including China, Japan and Latin America, Apple said.  Apple\u2019s services business, which includes Apple Music, the App Store and iCloud, is becoming increasingly important to the Apple\u2019s financial outlook because the smart phone market has matured and iPhone sales growth has slowed. In its most recent quarter, Apple\u2019s services business grew 18 percent to $8.4 billion, missing analyst expectations of $8.6 billion.

The EU decision is the latest in a series by global regulators that have amounted to billions of dollars in fines and require changes in Qualcomm business. The contract at issue with Apple is no longer in force, and Qualcomm already faces more competition from Intel and other rivals.  Still, the EU decision could make Qualcomm more vulnerable to chipmaker Broadcom Ltd\u2019s $103 billion hostile bid, since Broadcom argues it can smooth rocky relations with customers such as Apple..  Qualcomm said it would appeal the decision immediately.  The European Commission said its investigation, launched in 2015, covered the period from 2011 to 2016 and took into account Qualcomm\u2019s market dominance in LTE baseband chipsets, which enable rapid mobile broadband connections.  \u201cQualcomm paid billions of U.S. dollars to a key customer, Apple, so that it would not buy from rivals. These payments were not just reductions in price \u2013 they were made on the condition that Apple would exclusively use Qualcomm\u2019s baseband chipsets in all its iPhones and iPads,\u201d European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.  \u201cThis meant that no rival could effectively challenge Qualcomm in this market, no matter how good their products were,\u201d she said.  The fine represented 4.9 percent of Qualcomm\u2019s 2017 turnover, the Commission said.  Qualcomm General Counsel Don Rosenberg said in a statement that the company believed its agreement with Apple did not violate EU rules. \u201cWe have a strong case for judicial review and we will immediately commence that process,\u201d he said.  Qualcomm\u2019s shares were down 1.35 percent at $67.42 in midday trade, and analysts saw the fine as good for Broadcom\u2019s approach.  \u201cWhile Qualcomm believes they are in a temporary (albeit perfect) storm of customer and regulatory issues, Broadcom believes that the current problems are a harbinger of further headwinds to come,\u201d Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Bernstein, said in a note to clients Wednesday. \u201cAnd this latest finding continues to support the idea that regulators remain unhappy with the current state of affairs.\u201d  Despite levying fines, EU antitrust regulators recently cleared Qualcomm\u2019s $38 billion bid to buy NXP Semiconductors. Chinese regulators still need to approve the deal, and some NXP shareholders want a higher price.  Qualcomm is required to post a bond for the fine while the appeal unfolds, which will likely result in a charge for the current quarter. When hit with fines in the past, such as $774 million levy last year from Taiwanese regulators, Qualcomm took a charge as it appealed.  RELATIONS WITH APPLE STRAINED  Vestager told a news conference there would be no repercussions for Apple in the case.  EU antitrust regulators have come under pressure after European judges sent a case against U.S. chipmaker Intel back to an EU court for an appeal. Intel was fined 1 billion euros in 2009 for paying computer makers to buy most of their chips from them.  Google has also appealed against a record 2.4 billion euro fine for giving prominent placements in searches to its shopping service and demoting rival offerings.  This is the Commission\u2019s first decision on market abuse since the Intel ruling last September. Vestager said the ruling had given guidance on how to prove its case.  \u201cWe have carefully examined the ruling and the evidence in our case to make sure that our decision fully complies with the guidance given by the court,\u201d she said.  Apple and Qualcomm are meanwhile locked in a wide-ranging legal battle over Qualcomm\u2019s business practices, which started a year ago with Apple suing Qualcomm for nearly $1 billion in patent royalty rebates that the chipmaker allegedly withheld from the phone maker.  Other regulators, including the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, are also investigating Qualcomm\u2019s dealings with Apple. The EU competition enforcer is expected to rule in the coming months against Qualcomm in another case involving British phone software maker Icera, which was later acquired by Nvidia Corp, a person familiar with the matter has told Reuters.  In that case, Qualcomm is accused of selling chipsets below cost to drive out Icera - a practice known as predatory pricing.

VirnetX\u2019s stock rose as much as 44 percent on the news in after hours trading. The company closed at $4.10 per share on Tuesday.  Apple\u2019s stock has seen little change on the news given that the $502.6 million award is minuscule compared to the company\u2019s profits. The company generated $20 billion profit in the first quarter, the company said in February.  VirnetX claimed that Apple\u2019s FaceTime, VPN on Demand and iMessage features infringe four patents related to secure communications, claims that Apple denied.  The dispute has bounced between the district court, patent office and Federal Circuit since 2010. There have been multiple trials, most recently one involving earlier versions of the Apple devices. A jury in that case awarded $302 million that a judge later increased to $439.7 million.  Kendall Larsen , CEO of VirnetX, said the damages, which were based on sales of more than 400 million Apple devices, were \"fair.\"  \"The evidence was clear,\" Larsen said after the verdict was announced. \"Tell the truth and you don\u2019t have to worry about anything.\"  Apple lawyers declined to comment.  For VirnetX, the jury verdict in its favor could be a short-lived victory. The Patent Trial and Appeal Board has said the patents are invalid, in cases that are currently before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington.  The Federal Circuit, which handles all patent appeals, declined to put this trial on hold, saying it was so far along that a verdict would come before a final validity decision.  VirnetX, based in Zephyr Cove, Nevada, reported just over $1 million in revenue last year but investors have boosted the stock by more than 70 percent in hopes of an eventual victory over Apple.  The company started within government contractor SAIC Inc., tasked with developing secure communications for the Central Intelligence Agency. It was spun out with aspirations to be bought by Microsoft Corp. Instead, Microsoft paid it $200 million to end litigation in 2010, and then another $23 million for newer products.

Apple runs one of the largest manufacturing chains in the world, but most of the work is done at factories owned by contractors.  Apple audited 756 suppliers in 30 countries, 197 of which it was auditing for the first time.  Apple said in its annual supplier responsibility report that the proportion of \"low performers,\" or suppliers scoring less than 59 points on its 100-point scale, fell to 1 percent in 2017 from 3 percent in 2016 and 14 percent in 2014. \"High performers\" with scores of more than 90 rose to a record high of 59 percent from 47 percent the year before.  Apple found 44 so-called \"core violations\" of its labor rules in 2017, double the previous year. Those included three instances of employees forced to pay excessive fees for a job, a practice Apple banned in 2015.  In one case, over 700 foreign contract workers recruited from the Philippines were charged a total of $1 million to work for a supplier. Apple said it forced the supplier to repay the money.  Compliance with Apple's 60-hour work week fell to 94 percent of suppliers from 98 percent the year before. Moreover, Apple said it uncovered 38 cases of falsification of working hours data in 2017, up from 9 cases the year before.  Apple said the increase was driven by the fact that it brought on a number of new suppliers in 2017 and started tracking the working hours data of 1.3 million supplier employees, 30 percent more than in previous years.  In the report, Apple also said it was launching a new women's' health initiative at its supplier plants, with a goal of reaching 1 million women by 2020. And it said that it had launched a program in China to train workers to become factory line leaders, who often make 20 percent to 30 percent more than line workers.  On Wednesday, Apple also issued its so-called conflict minerals report, which is required by United States securities regulators. The report lists suppliers of sensitive metals such as tin and gold.  Apple company said that 16 smelters and refiners left its supply chain in 2017, 10 of which were dropped because they would not participate in a third-party audit of their practices. Six left of their own accord.  Apple also outlined new rules on student labor after a discovery last year that some Chinese students were working more than 11 hours a day assembling its iPhone X.

Beck Diefenbach/Reuters  Apple acquired music recognition app Shazam in December for a reported $400 million.  It was clear Apple would integrate Shazam into its streaming service Apple Music \u2014 but neither company has given more detail.  Shazam's earliest big investor thinks Apple could get up to 7.5 million new Apple Music subscribers as a result of the deal \u2014 a nice bump to its existing 30 million subscribers.  Analyst Mark Mulligan said the acquisition is probably a combination of subscribers, plus the valuable data Shazam can give on what streaming services people use and what songs they really like.  To understand what Apple might do with its latest acquisition Shazam, you have to understand its evolving business model, according to early investor DN Capital.  The venture capital firm's chief executive, Nenad Marovac, first invested in Shazam in 2004, when its music recognition tech involved users dialling a number, holding up their phones to a source of music, then receiving an SMS \"tag\" which identified a song. Now, the song recognition is done through an app.  \"The way Shazam started off its business model was that after five [SMS] 'tags' you had to pay for it,\" said Marovac. \"Then it moved into lead-generation for MP3s, then it became an affiliate for streaming companies.\"  In other words, if you identified a song, then clicked a link inside Shazam to buy the song through iTunes, a cut of your payment would go to Shazam. But that became less profitable when streaming took off.  Apple once dominated music consumption, when people bought individual MP3 tracks through iTunes. Since the advent of Spotify, it hasn't kept up. Shazam might be a way to drive growth once again.  \"Since Apple has launched Apple Music, it's still a way behind the curve, behind Spotify,\" said Marovac. \"Shazam has 150 million active users a month, and about 300 million to 400 million uniques per year. If you convert 1% to 5% of those users to Apple Music, the investment will pay for itself in spades.\"  BI Graphics  Apple Music had 30 million paying subscribers, according to statistics released in September. Adding 5% of Shazam's base would add a maximum of 7.5 million paying users \u2014 a nice bump, but also best case scenario.  For long-time music industry watcher and Midia analyst Mark Mulligan, the deal is more than just generating paying users for Apple Music.  Apple really needs data to persuade people to use Apple Music more  Customer acquisition is one reason why Apple might have acquired Shazam, Mulligan told Business Insider. It's also likely Shazam will give Apple Music much needed new features that will keep users sticking around for longer, like Spotify's massively successful playlists.  \"Ultimately Apple will have relatively small concerns about how it will be able to acquire customers for Apple Music in the longer term,\" Mulligan said.  \"In relative terms, it's behind Spotify in terms of playlists and weekly active use,\" he added. \"Those are the metrics it needs to do more to drive. The Shazam dataset will be an important asset.\"  When you open the Shazam app and identify a song, you can then stream that song via Apple Music or rivals like Amazon Music and Spotify. That's valuable insight into how people are using other services.  \"It's a window into billions of data points about Shazam's Spotify, Amazon, and Deezer users, there's some value in that,\" said Mulligan. \"It really comes down \u2014 how short was the iTunes dataset coming up? If iTunes' data on a decade of user preferences wasn't good enough, then maybe Shazam was necessary.\"  Mulligan likened the Shazam acquisition to Spotify's purchase of Echo Nest, which now informs its massively successful playlists. It's the poor man's version though. \"To be frank, if I could choose between Shazam and Echo Nest, I'd pick Echo Nest any day,\" he said.  With so competition in music streaming, Shazam is also a signal that Apple is \"serious\" about music. \"Look at Yahoo,\" said Mulligan. \"That should have died off a decade ago, but they kept going by making big acquisitions that made people think Yahoo was serious. It used its increased market cap to then make another overpriced acquisition. There's a proven business model in making overpriced acquisitions to companies vaguely relevant to the space.\"", "stock": "AAPL", "label": -1, "date": "2018-01-25", "source": "business-insider", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-bought-shazam-for-new-subscribers-and-to-rival-spotifys-playlisting-tech-2018-1"}, {"article": "Apple isn\u2019t just a tech company as the company is now hiring doctors and other medical staff to create its own medical clinics.

This sounds like a nice upgrade from last year\u2019s iPad but not a true departure from this product line.  Apple also said that there are 200,000 education apps in the App Store right now. The company is trying to position the iPad as a more capable device against Google Chromebooks. And in order to attract schools, Apple is offering 200GB per iCloud account instead of 5GB of free storage.

Apple already designs a lot of custom silicon, including its chipsets like the W-series for its Bluetooth headphones, the S-series in its watches, its A-series iPhone chips, as well as customized GPU for the new iPhones. In that sense, Apple has in a lot of ways built its own internal fabless chip firm, which makes sense as it looks for its devices to tackle more and more specific use cases and remove some of its reliance on third parties for their equipment. Apple is already in the middle of in a very public spat with Qualcomm over royalties, and while the Mac is sort of a tertiary product in its lineup, it still contributes a significant portion of revenue to the company.  Creating an entire suite of custom silicon could do a lot of things for Apple, the least of which bringing in the Mac into a system where the devices can talk to each other more efficiently. Apple already has a lot of tools to shift user activities between all its devices, but making that more seamless means it\u2019s easier to lock users into the Apple ecosystem. If you\u2019ve ever compared connecting headphones with a W1 chip to the iPhone and just typical Bluetooth headphones, you\u2019ve probably seen the difference, and that could be even more robust with its own chipset. Bloomberg reports that Apple may implement the chips as soon as 2020.  Intel may be the clear loser here, and the market is reflecting that. Intel\u2019s stock is down nearly 8% after the report came out, as it would be a clear shift away from the company\u2019s typical architecture where it has long held its ground as Apple moves on from traditional silicon to its own custom designs. Apple, too, is not the only company looking to design its own silicon, with Amazon looking into building its own AI chips for Alexa in another move to create a lock-in for the Amazon ecosystem. And while the biggest players are looking at their own architecture, there\u2019s an entire suite of startups getting a lot of funding building custom silicon geared toward AI.

The category has long been a lynchpin in Apple\u2019s strategy \u2014 something that Steve Jobs held near and dear.  Any \u201980s kid will tell you that Apple was a force to be reckoned with \u2014 Apple computers were mainstays in computer labs across the country. It\u2019s always been a good fit for a company focused on serving creators, bringing that extra bit of pizzazz to the classroom. In recent years, however, there\u2019s been a major shift. The Chromebook has become the king of the classroom, thanks in no small part to the inexpensive hardware and limited spec requirements.  Based on Google\u2019s early positioning of the category, it appears that the Chromebook\u2019s classroom success even managed to catch its creators off-guard. The company has since happily embraced that success \u2014 while Microsoft appears to have shifted its own approach in response to Chrome OS\u2019s success.  Apple\u2019s own responses have been less direct, and today\u2019s event was a reconfirmation of the company\u2019s commitment to the iPad as the centerpiece of its educational play. If Apple can be seen as reacting, it\u2019s in the price of the product. Gone are the days that schools\u2019 entire digital strategy revolved around a bunch of stationary desktops in a dusty old computer lab.  But while education has been a piece of the iPad strategy since the product launched eight years ago next month, the tablet was long price-prohibitive. The company has addressed that through school discounts and lowering the overall cost of the line, as the tablet market has started to stagnate, but the last couple of upgrades have dropped pricing down to a far more approachable $299.  A one-iPad-per-child approach is still out of the realm of plenty of public schools, but it\u2019s easy to see how the product could be appealing for school IT managers looking to roll out the iPad cart to classrooms. And additions like Managed Apple IDs have made it easier for multiple kids to share the same device, as a cost-cutting measure.  Along with devoted educational software, the company demonstrated how existing apps like Clips and Garage Band can be repurposed within the educational context to help bring a level of multimedia interactivity to the learning process. The company even sat us down in classrooms today to walk us through some of those projects.  Of course, right now, the market is Google\u2019s to lose. The company reportedly controls around 60 percent of the market. Much like Android, the heart of Chrome OS\u2019s approach is an embrace of third-party manufacturers, which have helped keep the cost down.  Schools with tight budgets can pick up a dirt-cheap Chromebook for $100-$150 less than an iPad. It\u2019s easy to see how that\u2019s an appealing proposition, especially when broken units are just par for the course in the hands of students.  In spite of its success, Google\u2019s certainly not an island. Yesterday\u2019s announcement of the first Chromebook tablet was both a response to Apple\u2019s involvement in the space and a preemptive strike against today\u2019s event, though the new Acer device is actually $30 more expensive than Apple\u2019s educational discount. The company sort of shot itself in the foot on that one, but expect to see more competitively priced slates from other hardware partners.  Microsoft held its own education event in May of last year, showing off its solution to Chrome OS. Thus far, however, Windows 10 S has been kind of a mess, thanks in no small part to some pretty convoluted messaging on the company\u2019s part. The company plans to streamline things a bit by making 10 S a mode inside of Windows 10.  The idea is basically the same, either way, offering a stripped-down version of the operating system that can be locked down from outside apps, so teachers can make sure nothing unseemly makes its way onto the device. It takes less of a toll on the hardware, with the company introducing a new line of PCs starting at $189 \u2014 a clear swipe at the Google\u2019s dominance.  In fact, the company came out and said as much in the accompanying press material, saying the products were \u201cthe same price as Chromebooks, with none of the compromises.\u201d And while Google\u2019s online office applications have grown in popularity, Microsoft software is still nearly ubiquitous in offices, so there\u2019s something to be said for prepping kids for the real world through use of such applications.", "stock": "AAPL", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-27", "source": "techcrunch", "url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/03/27/comparing-apple-google-and-microsofts-education-plays/"}, {"article": "Subscribe: iTunes | Google Play Music  Book Review A Marine\u2019s Inventive Memoir Matt Young discusses \u201cEat the Apple,\u201d and A.

The feature is to become part of Apple\u2019s popular Health app. It will enable users to transfer clinical data \u2014 like cholesterol levels and lists of medications prescribed by their doctors \u2014 directly from their medical providers to their iPhones, potentially streamlining how Americans gain access to some health information.

Broadcom typically slashes costs, especially research and development, and the company said it would do exactly that if it acquired Qualcomm. \u201cIn the long run that\u2019s not good for the country or for society,\u201d Mr. Dodson said.  He agreed with the Trump administration\u2019s assessment that, by cutting Qualcomm\u2019s research costs, Broadcom would be assisting Chinese rivals in the global race for dominance in 5G communications technology.  But as an investor, his reasoning can pretty much be reduced to one word: Apple.  Apple has traditionally been one of Qualcomm\u2019s biggest customers, along with Samsung and every other major handset company. But the two technology giants are also embroiled in an epic battle over licensing fees for Qualcomm\u2019s patented technology, with profound implications not only for Qualcomm\u2019s business model and Apple\u2019s profit margins, but for the future of wireless communication.  Photo  If Qualcomm and Apple can just bury the hatchet, Mr. Dodson reasons, Qualcomm\u2019s revenues would soar, and its stock price would climb well past Broadcom\u2019s offering price of $79 a share. By Mr. Dodson\u2019s reckoning, once Apple resumes paying Qualcomm, the chip maker will be worth at least $84 a share, \u201cwhich is why Broadcom\u2019s offer didn\u2019t really engage my attention,\u201d he said.  That, however, is a big \u201cif,\u201d given the intractable positions both sides have staked out.  At the heart of the dispute is the way Qualcomm calculates the licensing fee it charges customers, which is a percentage of the cost of the net selling price of the entire handset \u2014 and not the price of the chip. That means that Apple, a high-cost producer whose iPhone X sells for as much as $1,000, has paid much higher licensing fees than low-cost competitors using exactly the same chip set.  Apple has called the arrangement an \u201cextortion scheme.\u201d It infuriates Apple that Qualcomm has, in effect, been subsidizing its low-cost competitors, including the very Chinese companies that Mr. Trump says he is so concerned about.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Qualcomm has countered that its intellectual property makes many of the iPhones\u2019 distinctive features possible, features that low-cost competitors haven\u2019t replicated, and therefore Qualcomm deserves a percentage of the cost of the entire device.  Mr. Dodson made little immediate headway when he met with a delegation of top Qualcomm officials late last month and pressed his case for a settlement with Apple. The officials, including the chief executive, Steve Mollenkopf, and Paul Jacobs, a Qualcomm founder and, until recently, executive chairman, visited Mr. Dodson in San Francisco to make their case against the Broadcom bid.  In Mr. Dodson\u2019s account of the meeting, he urged the Qualcomm executives to settle with Apple rather than risk alienating it as a customer over the long term. But Qualcomm officials said that Apple was demanding more than they were prepared to give and that, on an engineering level, relations with Apple remained good. They assured him that eventually they would reach a settlement, revenues would normalize and Qualcomm stock would respond.

Still, \u201cI\u2019d like to see them budge\u201d on the licensing issue, Mr. Dodson said. \u201cI can see Apple\u2019s point.\u201d  But if Qualcomm stopped charging Apple a percentage of the device\u2019s cost, it would probably have to extend similar terms to all its major customers. It recently amended its agreement with Samsung without abandoning its approach to license fees. At the meeting, Qualcomm officials told Mr. Dodson they offered Apple similar terms, but Apple rejected them.  A Qualcomm spokeswoman declined to comment, as did an Apple spokeswoman.  Long-simmering tensions between Qualcomm and Apple reached a boiling point in 2016, when Qualcomm halted rebates it was giving Apple. Qualcomm claimed Apple had violated the terms of the rebate agreement by cooperating with South Korea\u2019s investigation into what Samsung and others said was exclusionary conduct by Qualcomm. Apple responded by withholding the license fees it paid manufacturers of iPhones, who in turn stopped passing on the payments to Qualcomm.  Photo  Lawsuits and counterclaims erupted, and Qualcomm reduced its revenue estimates by $500 million a year.  While Apple has continued to buy and deploy the latest Qualcomm chips, it also reached out to a rival chip maker, Intel, which began supplying an alternative to Qualcomm\u2019s chip for the iPhone 7. (That phone, the iPhone 8 and the X may contain either a Qualcomm or an Intel chip.)  Qualcomm claims that Apple has compromised the performance of Qualcomm-equipped handsets in order to mask their superiority over the Intel-equipped phones. (Both Intel and Apple have vehemently denied the claims.)  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Numerous lawsuits are now well underway in the United States, with some expected to go to trial later this year. Regulators in the European Union, Taiwan, South Korea and China have ruled that Qualcomm\u2019s licensing practices are unlawful and have levied fines, decisions that Qualcomm is appealing. In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission is conducting its own investigation.  While armies of patent lawyers fight over the rival claims, investors have already rendered a verdict. Qualcomm shares, after peaking at more than $80 in 2014, dropped by nearly 50 percent, hitting a low of $44 in 2016.  Qualcomm\u2019s precipitous decline is what attracted Mr. Dodson\u2019s attention along with other so-called value investors, who look for stocks trading below their intrinsic value. He said his fund\u2019s average cost per share for its Qualcomm position was about $56, so the fund was still ahead even after the deal collapsed this week. On Thursday, Qualcomm was trading at around $60.  Still, Qualcomm\u2019s performance has knocked the Endeavor fund from its perch at the top of the Morningstar rankings. So far this year, it\u2019s 61st.  Now that Mr. Trump has rescued Qualcomm from the imminent threat of a Broadcom takeover, its financial prospects \u2014 and share price \u2014 will largely follow the twists and turns in the Apple standoff. While Mr. Dodson remains optimistic about the outcome, that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s against all potential takeovers of Qualcomm.  Last week, there were rumors that Intel might launch a bid for Broadcom, which made Mr. Dodson wonder: \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t it bid for Qualcomm?

So who\u2019s left?  The same company that always seems to turn up when it\u2019s time to cross into a new era of technology: Apple.  I got to thinking about Apple\u2019s responsibility last week when two large investors wrote an open letter asking the company to do more about its products\u2019 effects on children. I was initially inclined to dismiss the letter as a publicity stunt; if you\u2019re worried about children and tech, why not go after Facebook?  But when I called several experts, I found they agreed with the investors. Sure, they said, Apple isn\u2019t responsible for the excesses of the digital ad business, but it does have a moral responsibility to \u2014 and a business interest in \u2014 the well-being of its customers.  And there\u2019s another, more important reason for Apple to take on tech addiction: because it would probably do an elegant job of addressing the problem.  \u201cI do think this is their time to step up,\u201d said Tristan Harris, a former design ethicist at Google who now runs Time Well Spent, an organization working to improve technology\u2019s impact on society.  \u201cIn fact,\u201d Mr. Harris added, \u201cthey may be our only hope.\u201d  For one thing, Apple\u2019s business model does not depend on tech addiction. The company makes most of its money by selling premium devices at high profit margins. Yes, it needs to make sure you find your phone useful enough to buy the next one, but after you purchase your phone and sign up for some of its premium services, Apple doesn\u2019t really need you to overdo it. Indeed, because it can\u2019t make infinite battery life, Apple would probably be O.K. if you cooled it with your phone a little.

View all New York Times newsletters.  Yet even though Apple is not part of the ad business, it exerts lots of control over it. Every tech company needs a presence on the iPhone or iPad; this means that Apple can set the rules for everyone. With a single update to its operating system and its app store, Apple could curb some of the worst excesses in how apps monitor and notify you to keep you hooked (as it has done, for instance, by allowing ad blockers in its mobile devices). And because other smartphone makers tend to copy Apple\u2019s best inventions, whatever it did to curb our dependence on our phones would be widely emulated.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Mr. Harris suggested several ideas for Apple to make a less-addictive smartphone. For starters, Apple could give people a lot more feedback about how they\u2019re using their devices.  Imagine if, once a week, your phone gave you a report on how you spent your time, similar to how your activity tracker tells you how sedentary you were last week. It could also needle you: \u201cFarhad, you spent half your week scrolling through Twitter. Do you really feel proud of that?\u201d It could offer to help: \u201cIf I notice you spending too much time on Snapchat next week, would you like me to remind you?\u201d  Another idea is to let you impose more fine-grained controls over notifications. Today, when you let an app send you mobile alerts, it\u2019s usually an all-or-nothing proposition \u2014 you say yes to letting it buzz you, and suddenly it\u2019s buzzing you all the time.  Mr. Harris suggested that Apple could require apps to assign a kind of priority level to their notifications. \u201cLet\u2019s say you had three notification levels \u2014 heavy users, regular users and lite, or Zen,\u201d Mr. Harris said.  Apple could set rules for what kind of notifications were allowed in each bucket \u2014 for instance, the medium bucket might allow notifications generated by other people (like a direct message in Instagram) but not those from the app itself (Instagram just sending you an alert to remind you that your high school friend\u2019s mom\u2019s brother posted a new picture recently).  \u201cAnd then Apple could say, by default, everyone is in the middle level \u2014 and instantly it could save a ton of users a ton of energy in dealing with this,\u201d Mr. Harris said.  There\u2019s a danger that some of these anti-addiction efforts could get too intrusive. But that\u2019s also why Apple would shine here; building a less-addictive phone is chiefly a problem of interface design, which is basically Apple\u2019s entire corporate raison d\u2019\u00eatre.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Another thing that Apple is good at is marketing, and I suspect it could make a lot of gauzy ads showing people getting more out of iPhones and iPads by unplugging from them for a little while. Note that it already sells a device, the Apple Watch, whose marketing extols the magic of leaving your phone behind.  Done right, a full-fledged campaign pushing the benefits of a more deliberative approach to tech wouldn\u2019t come off as self-interest, but in keeping with Apple\u2019s best vision of itself \u2014 as a company that looks out for the interests of humanity in an otherwise cold and sometimes inhumane industry.  \u201cHow we live with technology is the cultural issue of the next half-century,\u201d said James Steyer, the founder and chief executive of Common Sense Media, a nonprofit group that studies how children are affected by media.  He suggested that the feeling was ripe for Apple to tap into. \u201cIt\u2019s something that everyone cares about \u2014 whether you\u2019re a Republican or a Democrat, liberal or conservative, whether you live in San Francisco or Biloxi, Miss., you know that you and your kids are part of the arms race for attention,\u201d he said.  Apple released a statement last week saying it cared deeply \u201cabout how our products are used and the impact they have on users and the people around them,\u201d adding that it had a few features on addiction in the works.

Apple also mentions using \u2018polarizer layers\u2019 to help reduce any possible reflections of the light of one screen on the other, and which may also allow the user to view the screens outdoors while wearing sunglasses.  The patent mentions not just a MacBook use case, but also the possibility of having a detachable 2-in-1 built like this, which might indicate that Apple could be considering pairing up this invention with the iPad rather than its notebooks.  As ever, this is just a patent, and its existence doesn\u2019t necessarily mean anything for either MacBooks or iPads; ultimately, the concept may never leave the development and testing labs.  Patently polarizing  If it does come to fruition as a MacBook, it\u2019s likely not just going to have \u2018polarizer layers\u2019, but also a polarizing effect \u2013 there are certainly those who dislike the Touch Bar, and they\u2019re unlikely to welcome the expansion of the concept to a full virtual keyboard.  There may be doubts about exactly how effective such a virtual peripheral can be compared to the typing action of a physical keyboard. Although Lenovo has already done something similar with its Yoga Book convertible complete with virtual Halo Keyboard, and we were \u201camazed\u201d at how accurate the typing experience felt.  Perhaps what will be more worrying to those in the doubting camp is what this might do to the price tag of the MacBook. Especially if you look at the inflationary effect the introduction of the Touch Bar had on Apple\u2019s notebook range.  Still, we shouldn\u2019t get ahead of ourselves here, and the concept is definitely an interesting one if it does ever see the light of day.

It's shorn of the power and performance of the iPad Pro range, but the addition of Apple Pencil compatibility and the A10 chipset bring it pretty close, and for a lot less cash. It irks that you need to buy the Pencil separately to unlock a key feature, and design-wise we're seeing something pretty old-school here\u2026 but for the price it's hard to criticize too much, and this is still the best tablet on the market.  The new iPad for 2018 is designed to achieve one thing: deliver the best of Apple\u2019s tablet efforts at a more affordable price.  Note that we say more affordable, rather than cheap \u2013 because the cost is still higher than many other tablets out there \u2013 but the new upgrades bring a lot to the iPad, bridging the gap between a \u2018standard\u2019 slate and the more impressive iPad Pro range.  Support for the Apple Pencil adds another dimension to the tablet, enabling a new method of interaction and bringing with it a slew of new apps to interact with, and the upgraded chipset inside \u2013 the same one that powered the iPhone 7 \u2013 offers more power than many will know what to do with.  The upshot? You\u2019ve now got a hugely capable tablet, one with more power and offering more possibilities, at a fairly reasonable price point.  You may be thinking that this is a \u2018student\u2019s iPad\u2019, as Apple has made a big deal about the new tablet's classroom credentials, but in reality most of the people who buy it will be those who want something to use on the commute and around the house \u2013 and as you\u2019ll see, it fares pretty well in those respects.  While this might all sound impressive, it\u2019s still not the full picture, as all these features are combined with the best tablet platform out there, iOS \u2013 there\u2019s a reason the iPad has sat atop our best tablet rankings for so long.  The new iPad was launched in March 2018, and comes with a range of storage and connectivity options.  The new iPad 2018 price starts at $329 (\u00a3319, AU$469), but schools will get a discount in the UK and US of around 10%.  At $329 (AU$469) the new iPad price is exactly the same as the starting price of the new iPad (2017) \u2013 and both come with 32GB of storage \u2013 in the US and Australia, while in the UK it looks like consumers are being treated to a discount, as currency fluctuations mean the basic 32GB version is actually \u00a320 cheaper than last year's iPad.  That's for the Wi-Fi only model, with the 32GB slate with cellular connectivity setting you back $459 (\u00a3449, AU$669).  The 128GB version begins at $429 / \u00a3409 / AU$599 for those who want more storage, with an extra premium to pay if you want some bytes of data floating in on the go.  Apple Pencil  Useful addition for artists  Costs extra to buy  The Apple Pencil\u2026 it\u2019s tough to work out whether it\u2019s a genuinely innovative tool or not. We\u2019ve been using it for a few years now, and have found that it\u2019s great for some things, but useless for others.  Also, let\u2019s not forget that it costs \u00a399 / $99 / AU$145, which means you need to pay around 33% of the price of the new iPad, on top of the cost of the slate itself, in order to access the key new feature.  It\u2019s cheaper for those in education, and there is the Logitech Crayon available in the US for half the price (and less functionality), but it\u2019s worth bearing in mind when buying the new iPad.  If you\u2019re looking for something to replace a notepad, we wouldn\u2019t recommend the new iPad \u2013 or any iPad for that matter, as it\u2019s really difficult to write legibly on them, thanks to the way the tip of the Pencil glides across the surface.  Apple could make the glass more matte and ridged to help, but that would make the display harder to see, so it\u2019s not an easily solved conundrum.  The Notepad app is fine, and allows you to write and sketch, and now the iWork Suite from Apple is collaborative, and you can mark-up documents on it (it took Apple far too long to enable this feature, with Microsoft inexplicably adding in mark-up functionality first to its iPad apps.  This would be a lovely feature if, as referenced, writing on it was easy; but notes can't simply be jotted, they require concentrated efforts of penmanship\u2026 and most of the people we work with are on Google Docs, so sharing a marked-up Pages document was useless.  In a classroom environment it will be more useful if a teacher and the students are all on the same platform\u2026 as long as the teacher has immaculate handwriting and patience to write a little slower.  If you\u2019re just underlining sections or pointing to things then the finger is just as good \u2013 so maybe make sure you really need the Pencil before forking out all that cash.  However, where the stylus does become worth the outlay is when you want to be artistic \u2013 there are a few good apps out there for the Apple Pencil that let you color, change the shading of a photo or get pretty deep into some photo / video manipulation.  We had a great time coloring and sketching during our review, and even if you\u2019re bereft of any kind of talent there\u2019s a lot you can do.  The multi-level pressure of the Pencil comes into its own here, and if you\u2019re in any way artistic then you\u2019ve got loads \u2013 and loads, and loads \u2013 of different styles of brush, pen and other drawing implements you can work with.  Just note that most of the time you\u2019ll be charging the Pencil by plugging it into the bottom of the iPad\u2026 it doesn\u2019t look good.  A10 Fusion chip  Impressive power  Comes with 2GB of RAM  We were all expecting Apple to stick with the same \u2018good enough\u2019 A9 chipset from 2017\u2019s iPad and drop the price, but it\u2019s gone up and shoved in the A10 Fusion chip that powered the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, and which is close to the A10X chip in the new iPad Pro range.  That's combined with 2GB of RAM, so there's more than enough power here for nearly any task that most users will want to do with the new iPad, and certainly for emailing, web browsing or watching video.  We noticed some slowdown with heavier apps, for example when processing and opening multiple photos, but we never had to wait too long, and rendering times were still pretty impressive.  That said, if you\u2019re going to do a lot of more demanding work, that\u2019s why Apple has the iPad Pro 10.5 , with the extra power in the CPU and double the RAM.  In our tests, the new iPad (2018) returned a similar single-core benchmarking score to the more powerful iPad Pro 10.5, showing that if you\u2019re not going to be using the cheaper iPad intensively then there\u2019s no reason to spend the extra cash.  It might seem hard to fathom why Apple has thrown in the extra power here, but users will hang onto their iPads for a long, long time (much longer than they would an iPhone), and having more power means they\u2019ll keep running smoothly, and remain upgradeable, for longer.  You\u2019ll be unlikely to use most of the power in the new iPad, to be honest, but the upshot it that it runs incredibly smoothly, and apps open and close with ease\u2026 and it\u2019s likely to keep doing that for longer, so you won\u2019t need to upgrade as soon.", "stock": "AAPL", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-23", "source": "techradar", "url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/new-ipad-expected-to-support-apple-pencil-and-future-iphones-may-as-well"}, {"article": "Cook: The only way to protect your data is to encrypt it.

Longbow Research analyst Shawn Harrison lowered his rating on the technology giant to \u201cneutral\u201d from \u201cbuy\u201d on Wednesday, reflecting the view among some Wall Street researchers that the latest group of iPhones will deliver modest sales performance. He didn\u2019t specify a price target.  \u201cWe now forecast only a good, not great iPhone cycle,\u201d Mr. Harrison wrote in a research note.  He said the more expensive price point of the X model may hinder some demand and the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus models have received a \u201clukewarm\u201d reception, both of which could restrain growth in iPhone shipments. He estimates that iPhone production growth will be in the high-single digits, lower than the consensus view of 10% that he cites.  \u201cAlthough there are now expanded drivers to AAPL\u2019s business, the iPhone continues to wag the dog,\u201d Mr. Harrison wrote. \u201cGiven our change in estimated iPhone growth profile near term, we anticipate this dynamic will limit upside stock appreciation.\u201d  Wall Street analysts have historically been hesitant to bet against Apple Inc., whose shares are up 47% over the last 12 months and 670% in the past decade. Twenty-nine of 37 analysts tracked by FactSet have \u201cbuy\u201d or \u201coverweight\u201d ratings on the stock, with an average price target of $192.73. There are no \u201csell\u201d or \u201cunderweight\u201d ratings.  The average analyst price target has increased each month for the past 14, according to FactSet data. Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts, for example, lifted their price target on the stock to $200 from $180 on Wednesday.  Shares were down 0.2% to $175.88 in recent trading Wednesday.  Many analysts have cited factors that could drive the stock higher, such as a tax-code overhaul, which is likely to encourage companies to bring home cash held overseas and could be handed to shareholders through buybacks and dividends.

Apple Inc., AAPL 0.34% Alphabet Inc. GOOGL -0.12% and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN -1.22% \u2014with a combined market value of more than $2 trillion\u2014all boosted growth by broadening their reach into new areas.  Apple\u2019s revenue rose 13% to $88.29 billion, fueled by its move to increase smartphone prices behind its new flagship iPhone X, released in November at $1,000. The company, whose profits topped $20 billion for the first time, is also increasingly benefiting from its services business, including App Store sales and music and payments services.  Google parent Alphabet has averaged revenue growth of at least 20% over the past 32 quarters, when adjusting for currency movements, according to RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney. Google is building in other areas, including cloud computing, a business that Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said brings in $1 billion a quarter.  Meanwhile, Amazon\u2014long known for prioritizing growth over earnings\u2014delivered a profit exceeding $1 billion for the first time as its revenue jumped 38% to $60.5 billion.  More than the other two companies, Amazon has spread beyond its core market. The online-retail giant has built the largest cloud-computing business, created a major Hollywood studio and, more recently, become a big bricks-and-mortar retailer with the acquisition of Whole Foods, which accounted for roughly 7% of its sales.  Two of the other largest tech companies by market value\u2014 Microsoft Corp. and Facebook Inc. \u2014reported record sales a day earlier. Revenue at Microsoft rose 12% to $28.92 billion as its cloud-computing division continued to grow, while Facebook\u2019s revenue jumped 47% to $12.97 billion.  Those companies are the five most valuable in the U.S. by market capitalization, the first time a single industry has occupied that position in several decades, according to S&P Capital Inc.  As the tech giants expand their clout across a widening band of commerce, they have increasingly drawn scrutiny from lawmakers and consumers over a range of issues, from their dominance of certain markets, to how they use their vast troves of consumer data, to the impact their products have on society.  The extraordinary runup in their share prices has helped fuel popular awareness of the companies\u2019 power, says Youssef Squali, an analyst with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.  \u201cIt\u2019s a combination of the fact that these have become such huge behemoths that they bear responsibility to society, and on the other hand you have all this lack of control of personal data,\u201d Mr. Squali said.  Facebook is contending with claims that its massive social network has had harmful effects on mental health and is used to disseminate hate speech, violent live videos and fabricated news articles. Lawmakers have scrutinized Facebook and other social-media firms, saying they failed to take more steps to keep Russian-backed actors from sowing division during the U.S. presidential election.  Facebook says it is addressing the issues in a number of ways, including employing more people who handle safety and security issues and ranking publisher posts based on user evaluations of trustworthiness.  Apple is facing criticism from prominent investors over the way smartphones affect children, as well as federal probes over its disclosure that it issued software updates that slowed performance on iPhones with older batteries. Apple apologized and said it would never do anything to harm its customers.  Google drew a $2.71 billion fine from European regulators, who said the search giant favored its comparison-shopping service over rivals. Google\u2019s YouTube, meanwhile, is grappling with a backlash from marketers over the placement of their ads in front of undesirable videos, including YouTube\u2019s curated lineup of \u201cpreferred\u201d content.  Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said on a call with analysts that new controls to review top videos on YouTube and set new limits on which content can run ads will make the site a safe place for advertisers. There have been concerns, he said, but \u201cwe\u2019re working really hard to address them and respond strongly.\u201d  A major shift for the tech industry came with the election of President Donald Trump, who had been critical of the industry in part due to what he said was a lack of U.S. job creation and investments overseas. Tech CEOs a little over a year ago met with the then-president elect. Shortly thereafter, plans for a tech council to advise the president dissolved.  Most recently, Mr. Trump called out Amazon, tweeting that the U.S. Postal Service should charge the online retail giant and other companies more to deliver packages.  The mood extends to Capitol Hill. Sen. Mark Warner (D., Va.) and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.) are working on legislation that would make political advertising with companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google more transparent. Meanwhile, U.S. Senators Jerry Moran (R., Kan.) and Richard Blumenthal (D., Conn.) this week wrote the Federal Trade Commission to ask it to investigate companies that sell fake social-media accounts, mentioning Twitter and YouTube specifically.  At the annual World Economic Forum last month, the world\u2019s largest technology companies defended themselves against complaints about everything from perceived anticompetitive behavior to threats from artificial intelligence. Some critics questioned the companies\u2019 potential elimination of jobs through advanced technology, while others pointed to their control of large amounts of personal data.  Salesforce.com Inc. CEO Marc Benioff, at the Davos, Switzerland, forum, called some tech companies\u2019 behavior \u201cnefarious,\u201d comparing the companies to the cigarette industry and calling for more government regulation. Martin Sorrell, CEO of advertising giant WPP PLC, compared the firms to Standard Oil, a U.S. oil giant that was broken up after regulators determined it was a monopoly.  In response to a question about Amazon\u2019s size, the company\u2019s retail chief, Jeff Wilke, said in an interview late last year with The Wall Street Journal that its businesses are very diverse and horizontally large. \u201cWe have incredible competition,\u201d he added.  Trip Miller, founder and managing partner at Gullane Capital LLC, which owns shares in Amazon, Apple and Alphabet, said management at the companies was strong, and they appear to have good opportunities for continued growth.  \u201cWhile we do understand some of the concerns around data and them potentially having so much information on our lives, I think it\u2019s just a byproduct of the world we live in,\u201d he said.  Apple\u2019s results offered hope that it can sustain its solid performance even amid stagnating global demand for smartphones. Analysts and investors have worried the company is too dependent on the iPhone, which accounts for about two-thirds of its revenue, as customers hold onto their phones longer and therefore buy fewer new ones.  Sales of the iPhone X in the quarter lifted the average selling price for iPhones by nearly 15%, Apple said. The 1.3 billion iPhones and other Apple devices now in active use helped its services business report an 18% jump in revenue. Results also were buoyed by strong growth in the division that includes its smartwatch and AirPods wireless earbuds.  Alphabet\u2019s profit jumped 28% to $6.84 billion, excluding a giant $9.9 billion charge related to the new U.S. tax law which turned its bottom line into the red. While the ad business makes up nearly all of its profit, Alphabet is investing in a dozen businesses such as self-driving cars and cybersecurity in hopes they will drive future revenue.  Amazon\u2019s core retail business was the main producer of its revenue growth in the quarter, as holiday shoppers went online. It also benefited from the company\u2019s $13.5 billion acquisition of Whole Foods, which generated more than $4 billion in revenue.  Amazon is known for reinvesting heavily in its business, and has said in recent quarters it is in an investment phase focusing on international expansion and building out its video content, among other initiatives.  Contributing its profitability in the fourth quarter was a tax benefit of $789 million, part of the tax overhaul. Still, Amazon\u2019s cloud-computing division put in a strong performance, as did its growing advertising business. And the company also worked on efficiency at its warehouses.

Apple\u2019s dominance in classrooms has faded in the face of cheaper laptop options. Photo: Scott Olson/Getty Images  Apple Inc. said it is updating its entry-level iPad with capabilities designed to appeal to students and new software for teachers, as the company tries to recharge sales of the tablet and shore up its dwindling share of the U.S. education market.  The company Tuesday said its new 9.7-inch iPad includes a faster processor and works with the Apple Pencil stylus, which previously worked only with higher-end iPad Pro models.  The entry-level iPad\u2019s price remains at $329, the lowest-priced tablet available from the company. Schools, which receive discounts on pricing, can buy the device for $299.  The announcement, held at Lane Tech College Prep High School in Chicago, was coupled with software and support capabilities aimed at schools. They included more free cloud storage, a management system to assist schools with creating Apple IDs for students and a cloud-based app called Schoolwork that allows teachers to monitor students\u2019 progress on assignments.  The kindergarten-through-12 market represents a critical opportunity for tech companies to get young people accustomed to their operating systems. Introducing students to those systems could help sway future purchasing decisions that span the rest of their lives, said Scott Galloway, a marketing professor at New York University.  \u201cThe moment you get someone on your ecosystem, and they become fluent in your operating system, the switching costs become very real,\u201d Mr. Galloway said. A lot of consumers start on Apple\u2019s or Google\u2019s operating system and never switch, \u201cso it\u2019s logical to lock them in early,\u201d he said.  Technology companies have been pushing computers and other devices into the classroom since at least the 1970s, and Apple took an early lead with its easy-to-use operating system.  But the company\u2019s dominance faded in the face of cheaper laptop options such as Google Chromebooks from Alphabet Inc. or Windows-powered devices from Microsoft Corp. While many of those devices cost less than $300, Apple\u2019s MacBook starts at $999.  Apple\u2019s lowest-priced iPad, which got a $70 price cut last year, offers the company its best chance to compete in the cost-conscious education market.  But the addition of a Pencil and a keyboard\u2014which are necessary to take many computer-administered tests and could add more than $150 to the price\u2014make the iPad a costlier option than rival low-priced laptops, said Ben Davis, a senior education analyst with Futuresource Consulting.  Despite efforts by Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook to champion iPads as laptop replacements, iPad sales have fallen 40% from their peak in fiscal 2013 to $19.22 billion.  Losing ground to Chromebooks and Windows devices in the classroom contributed to the iPad\u2019s struggles, said Frank Catalano, an independent education technology analyst with Intrinsic Strategy.  The update to the entry level iPad is unlikely to reverse Apple\u2019s slump in education sales, analysts say. Over the past five years, Apple\u2019s share of computing shipments in the $18 billion U.S. education hardware market has fallen to 19% from 50%, according to Futuresource Consulting. Alphabet now has a 59% share, compared with Microsoft\u2019s 22%.  In addition to competing on price, Alphabet and Microsoft devices have gained ground in classrooms by offering a strong mobile-device management system that helps IT departments block students from exiting a browser during a test, Mr. Davis said.  Apple on Tuesday announced a system to enable students to share iPads, so they can log into any tablet and reach their own documents and apps. It said Apple\u2019s school management system would allow schools to create as many as 1,500 Apple IDs in minutes. The company also said it was expanding free iCloud storage for schools to 200 gigabytes from 5 GB.  The new Schoolwork app is coupled with a developer platform called ClassKit that developers can use to create apps that teachers can assign to students. It also announced a new curriculum called \u201cEveryone Can Create\u201d that allows teachers to integrate drawing, music, filmmaking and photography into lessons.  \u201cEducation is such a big part of who we are as a company and has been for 40 years,\u201d Mr. Cook said. \u201cTechnology can help teachers deliver a unique and personalized learning experience to all kids. We\u2019ve never stopped believing that.\u201d  While the iPad remains popular with children and teachers, educators have expressed frustration that they must seek out curriculum apps, rather than getting a simple suite of apps as Google provides, said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst with market-research firm Creative Strategies.  \u201cThey have done a lot on manageability, which will make a big difference\u201d for many schools, Ms. Milanesi said. \u201cWhile price has not changed for iPad, you get a lot more with it.\u201d  Write to Tripp Mickle at Tripp.Mickle@wsj.com", "stock": "AAPL", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-27", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-updates-ipad-with-stylus-support-1522167400"}, {"article": "Sick of Apple's iCloud ransom notes demanding money for more storage space? WSJ's Joanna Stern has tips on how to defuse the situation. Photo: Natalia Osipova/The Wall Street Journal.  Every night, I compose the following letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook :  Dear Mr. Cook,  Your iCloud storage is full.  Yours,  Joanna Stern  I never send it because I\u2019m not as unsympathetic as Apple, which by my count blasts out millions of annoying out-of-iCloud-storage alerts a day. Hey look! You got one just now.  I call them iCloud ransom notes. Don\u2019t pay Apple for storage and the threats will persist and all your data will be unsafe. Pay and the messages will end. Plus, you\u2019ll get some\u2026 iCloud. Whatever that is.  Apple is pretty matter-of-fact about it: \u201cWe notify our customers when they need more storage to continue to keep their information safely backed up in iCloud,\u201d a spokesman says.  If you have an iPhone, you\u2019ve probably seen one of these. Apple sends notifications to millions of customers when they need more storage space so their information remains safely backed up in iCloud. These messages can be avoided. Photo: APPLE  Yet after the holiday iPhone buying season, I began to realize that many of even the most tech-savvy people in my life don\u2019t quite understand how iCloud works. Heck, I had to go to an Apple Store\u2019s iCloud class to get some clarity. And my dad didn\u2019t know he had \u201cthe iCloud\u201d until he remembered the $1 monthly charge.  So I decided to tackle the messy, many-tendriled storage system. What do we need to understand? What does Apple need to start doing better? The following guide helps those who pay for iCloud get their money\u2019s worth\u2014and those who refuse to pay for iCloud live a happier, notification-free life.  What is iCloud?  Lose your iPhone but have iCloud? You won\u2019t lose much at all. That\u2019s the simplest way to understand this thing.  If your photos, videos, contacts and more are backed up to iCloud, they\u2019re safe and accessible from any other Apple device\u2014and most web browsers\u2014by just logging in. For a quick overview of what you actually have stored, log into icloud.com with your Apple ID and poke around.  Here\u2019s the big catch, though: Apple offers only 5 gigabytes of free iCloud storage space. That\u2019s like offering a Siberian tiger a Tic Tac for dinner. With the amount of photos and videos we take today, it\u2019s not enough. For a company with about $270 billion in the bank, I\u2019d expect it to at least match Google\u2019s 15GB of free cloud storage\u2014or beat it. Do I hear 20GB?  If you do need more, Apple charges you: $1 a month for 50GB, $3 for 200GB, $10 for 2 terabytes.  Before we dive into the rest, take out your iPhone. Go to Settings, then tap your name up top, then tap iCloud. You should be looking at a handy bar graph of your own iCloud storage allotment.  Photo: The Wall Street Journal  Chances are your bar graph is going to be dominated by two big chunks:  Backups. When your device is on Wi-Fi, locked and charging, iCloud automatically backs up all the data\u2014messages, settings, your homescreen layout, app data and more.  Photos. The Photos app has a clever trick: It uploads shots as soon as you take them. This iCloud Photo Library setting is on by default; if you turn it off, photos and videos are included in backups.  If that bar graph is getting filled up, you\u2019re probably starting to get those nagging out-of-storage notifications, which brings us to Mr. Frost\u2019s two diverging roads.  Road 1: Fine, I\u2019ll Pay  OK, so you agree to pay Apple every month.  First, you\u2019ve got to decide on a plan, and the new iCloud storage family sharing is incentive to pay for the 200GB or 2TB plans. Since last fall\u2019s iOS 11 release, you can share those buckets of storage with up to five members of your family. Don\u2019t worry, Johnny, if you upload a photo of your new vape, Mom won\u2019t be able to see it.  Whichever plan you choose should cover your phone backups and all-important photo storage. But you still need to fine-tune the way photos are handled.  On your iPhone, go to Settings, then scroll down and tap Photos. If you are worried about running out of space on your iPhone itself, select \u201cOptimize iPhone Storage.\u201d  Photo: The Wall Street Journal  This ensures that full-resolution photos and videos are stored in iCloud. You\u2019ll still see preview images on the phone, but it sometimes takes a few seconds before you can view the sharp original pic.  How do you tell what is actually backed up? You should see the update status on the bottom of the first Photos tab.  Once your backups are on track and your photos are squared away, you may find you have leftover space. This is where iCloud Drive comes into play. You can dump random files into it through the iCloud web interface, or\u2014on a Mac with the latest OS\u2014sync your Desktop and Documents files.  On iPads and iPhones, there\u2019s a new Files app, which is, confusingly, another door to iCloud Drive. Plus, you can add files in iOS through supported Apple apps such as Pages, Keynote and Notes, or through the sharing function: Tap the share button, then \u201cSave to Files.\u201d  While you can use iCloud Drive to sync files across your multiple devices, it still lacks some of the basics you get with Google Drive or Dropbox. For instance, on iCloud.com you can\u2019t upload a folder of files from your desktop.  Road 2: Nope, Not Paying  OK, you\u2019ve bought a phone for $700 or more and decided not even $1 more for Apple. Understandable.  So how do you survive with just 5GB and make the ransom notes cease? First, try to clear room. Delete backups of your old devices by going to iCloud > Manage Storage > Backup.  Photo: The Wall Street Journal  Apple doesn\u2019t offer a way to see the thousands of compressed files in these old backups. There are third party apps, such as AnyTrans, that do.  You can also thin out your current backup: Tap on the backup labeled \u201cThis iPhone\u201d then turn off third-party apps. There\u2019s no real need to back up apps like Twitter and Facebook ; just back up games that save your progress.  If that isn't enough, turn off iCloud backup altogether (iCloud > iCloud Backup). You can still manually back up your iPhone by syncing to iTunes\u2014even via Wi-Fi.  Backing up photos, of course, remains a necessity. For that, I recommend Google Photos, since it offers unlimited cloud storage for photos and videos. Photos with resolution over 16 megapixels will be downsized, but you can use Google\u2019s included 15GB of storage to keep those higher-resolution shots.  I find the transition process to be cleanest on a computer. Pull all the photos you have from your phone\u2014plus any photos that may live in your iCloud storage\u2014into the Photos app on your Mac, then go to File > Export. On Windows, use the iCloud for Windows app.  Go to Google Photos, then either drag all your photos to it, or use the uploader tool. Back on your iPhone or iPad, in the iCloud settings, turn off iCloud Photo Library and download the Google Photos app.  I leave you here with a moral challenge: Every time a storage-full message makes you mad, take to social media and urge Apple to give us 20GB free. Or just pay Apple the damn dollar.

FILE PHOTO - A Microsoft logo is seen a day after Microsoft Corp's $26.2 billion purchase of LinkedIn Corp, in Los Angeles, California, U.S. June 14, 2016. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo  In an email to employees publicly released late on Thursday, Microsoft Chief People Officer Kathleen Hogan said Microsoft had 83 harassment complaints in 2017 out of a U.S.-based workforce of over 65,000 employees.  Nearly 50 percent were found to be supported at least in part following an investigation, she said, and more than half of those resulted in the termination of an employee who engaged in unacceptable behavior.  The unusual publication of such data comes as the world\u2019s largest software company is defending a lawsuit which alleges it systematically denied pay raises or promotions to women. Microsoft denies it has ever had such a policy.  The lawsuit, filed in Seattle federal court in 2015, is attracting wider attention after a series of powerful men have left or been fired from their jobs in entertainment, the media and politics for sexual misconduct.  Microsoft also investigated 84 complaints of gender discrimination last year, Hogan said, and found around 10 percent of those to be supported at least in part.  Earlier this week, Reuters reported on the contents of unsealed court documents which showed that out of 118 gender discrimination complaints filed by women in U.S.-based technical jobs at Microsoft between 2010 and 2016, only one was deemed \u201cfounded\u201d by the company.  Attorneys for the women described the number of complaints as \u201cshocking\u201d in the court filings, and said the response by Microsoft\u2019s investigations team was \u201clackluster.\u201d  Hogan\u2019s email on Thursday linked to the Reuters story and said the numbers cited by plaintiffs were misleading.  \u201cReports that we rarely reach a conclusion in favor of the complainant are based on a faulty reading of a partial data set,\u201d Hogan wrote.  Hogan\u2019s email did not provide additional figures about the time period cited in the court documents.

Many developed economies have actually seen productivity stagnate or decline.    A survey from Microsoft Corp. is bolstering one theory about this disconnect. In a poll of 20,000 European workers released Monday, Microsoft, which became one of the world\u2019s most profitable companies by marketing office productivity software, acknowledges new digital technology can, in some circumstances, sometimes not lead to any increase in productivity and actually result in less employee engagement with their work.    Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft joins a growing number of prominent Silicon Valley companies and entrepreneurs that are starting to question the social benefits of the technology they once championed. Facebook Inc. warned in December that its social network might, in some cases, cause psychological harm.    Microsoft identifies a number of instances where technology can be a drag on productivity, including: workers who are too distracted by a constant influx of e-mails, Slack messages, Trello notifications, texts, Tweets \u2013 not to mention viral cat videos \u2013 to concentrate for sustained periods; workers who aren\u2019t properly trained to use the new technology effectively; tech that isn\u2019t adequately supported by the business, forcing workers to lose time because \u201cthe computers are down;\u201d and workers who suffer burnout because, with mobile devices and at-home-working, they feel tethered to the job around-the-clock.    Of course, Microsoft isn\u2019t saying that technology dampens productivity in all cases. Instead, it says that tech\u2019s impact depends largely on the culture of the business. Those with a \u201cstrong digital culture\u201d saw productivity gains from technology while those with what Microsoft termed a \u201cweak digital culture\u201d didn\u2019t.    Microsoft defined companies with a strong digital culture as those where employees had proper training in the new technology, access to information, managers who promoted the adoption of new technology, and where executives conveyed to employees a clear sense of how the technology fit into the company\u2019s strategic vision.    In such businesses, about 22 percent of employees reported feeling highly productive and only about 5 percent reported feeling unproductive, compared with just 12 percent reporting they were highly productive and 21 percent feeling unproductive in companies deemed to have a weak digital culture. The study\u2019s authors noted that even 22 percent reporting high productivity \u201csuggests there is still more work that can be done to help every employee do their best work.\u201d    The survey also found digital culture had a big impact on how new technology changed employees\u2019 feelings of engagement with their work. In businesses with a strong digital culture, increased use of technology also boosted employees\u2019 feelings of passion and focus. But, in companies with a weak digital culture, it had the opposite effect: the more technology the company deployed, the less attached workers became.    In an introduction to the study, Michel van der Bel, Microsoft\u2019s president for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said businesses should look at the adoption of new digital technology as \u201ca people journey\u201d and not just \u201can IT exercise.\u201d", "stock": "MSFT", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-05", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-05/microsoft-says-it-s-true-cat-videos-distract-workers"}, {"article": "The tech industry takes on the Trump administration at the U.S. Supreme Court Tuesday in a high-stakes clash over digital privacy and government access to information stored on overseas servers.  At issue is whether federal and state law enforcement officials can use a decades-old law to demand user emails and other data held abroad by domestic companies including Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and Microsoft Corp.  The case calls on the justices to decide how a law older than the World Wide Web itself applies in the era of cloud computing. What they say could have sweeping consequences -- that is, unless Congress acts on pending proposals to overhaul the law and set out a more nuanced approach.  \u201cThe court is presented with two pretty stark choices,\u201d said Jennifer Daskal, a professor at American University\u2019s Washington College of Law. There are \u201cproblems with either side winning,\u201d she said.  The case stems from a federal effort to use the 1986 Stored Communications Act to get emails from an unidentified account kept on a Microsoft server in Ireland. The government, which says the emails would show evidence of drug trafficking, got a search warrant in 2013. Microsoft refused to turn over the information, deciding to fight the matter in court instead.  Beyond U.S. Borders  Microsoft says the government is improperly trying to use the 1986 law in a foreign country. The Supreme Court is generally loath to say a federal law applies beyond the U.S. borders.  The government is trying to \u201cunilaterally reach into a foreign land to search for copy and import private customer correspondence physically stored in a digital lockbox on a foreign computer where it\u2019s protected by foreign law,\u201d said Joshua Rosenkranz, the lawyer who\u2019ll will argue the case for Microsoft.  The Trump administration, which inherited the case from President Barack Obama\u2019s legal team, says it\u2019s not trying to apply the U.S. law overseas. Officials served the warrant on Microsoft at its headquarters in Redmond, Washington, and disclosure of the email content would occur domestically as well, U.S. Solicitor General Noel Francisco said in court papers.  The law \u201cfocuses on disclosure, and the disclosure of records from Microsoft to the government would occur in the United States,\u201d Francisco argued.  Microsoft stores email content at more than 100 data centers in more than 40 countries. The company says it uses so many sites for the sake of speed, putting users as close as possible to their data.  Most Frequent Location  At the time of the search, Microsoft\u2019s policy was to store email content in the data center nearest to the customer\u2019s self-declared country of residence. The company has since changed its system so that it relies on the user\u2019s most frequent location.  Other companies store their data differently. Google breaks files into pieces that get stored separately and are constantly being moved from place to place. Google, Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. are among the many tech companies supporting Microsoft.  Business groups say a ruling in favor of the government would prompt users to shun U.S. cloud service providers in favor of foreign-based companies that could offer stronger privacy protections.  Privacy advocates also say such a ruling would invite reciprocity by foreign governments, putting the data of American users at risk from those governments even if it\u2019s held on servers in the U.S.  \u201cIf we say our process works abroad, you can bet that the rest of the world is going to say its process works here,\u201d said Greg Nojeim, senior counsel at the Center for Democracy and Technology in Washington.  \u2018Slow and Uncertain\u2019  The Trump administration says the consequences would be greater if the U.S. were to lose. Although the government would still be able to invoke treaties with some nations to get legal help, the administration says those cover less than half the world\u2019s countries and often mean a \u201cslow and uncertain\u201d process.  States also can use the Stored Communications Act, and 35 of them -- though not tech-heavy California or Microsoft\u2019s home state of Washington -- filed a brief backing the federal government.  \u201cThe business decisions of private corporations should not control whether law enforcement can obtain evidence of crimes committed in their jurisdictions,\u201d the states argued.  The all-or-nothing nature of the Supreme Court dispute is one reason people on both sides are urging Congress to step in, possibly even before the court can rule.  A bipartisan proposal known as the Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act, or Cloud Act, has support from both Microsoft and the Justice Department. It would make clear that U.S. warrants apply around the world, while also setting up a new process for providers to challenge warrants. The law also would put in place new rules for American companies when they receive information requests from foreign governments.  \u201cThe court doesn\u2019t have the tools to figure out the best balance,\u201d said Rosenkranz, the lawyer for Microsoft. \u201cIt\u2019s a policy decision that requires a scalpel, and all the court has is a meat cleaver.\u201d  The case is United States v.

The Trump administration is challenging a lower-court ruling that barred federal law enforcement officials from using the 1986 Stored Communications Act to get a suspected drug trafficker\u2019s emails, which were kept on a Microsoft server in Ireland. During an hour-long argument, the justices struggled to decide how a law older than the World Wide Web affects law enforcement in the era of cloud computing.  Chief Justice John Roberts suggested Microsoft\u2019s argument would put out of the government\u2019s reach an email sent from the Supreme Court building to someone just a block away, if the company had chosen to store it on a server outside the U.S.  Nothing would keep Microsoft \"from storing United States communications, every one of them, either in Canada or Mexico or anywhere else, and then telling their customers: Don\u2019t worry if the government wants to get access to your communications; they won\u2019t be able to,\" without getting help from a from foreign government, Roberts told Microsoft lawyer Joshua Rosenkranz.  Justice Samuel Alito expressed concern that law enforcement would be hobbled without the ability to demand offshore emails from companies located in the U.S.  He asked what happens when a U.S. citizen is being investigated for crimes in this country, and the government has shown it has an \"urgent need\" for \"evidence of this crime in emails that are in the possession of an American internet service provider\" that has stored the emails overseas.  Rosenkranz said U.S. prosecutors would ask for help from that country\u2019s government. \"If it\u2019s urgent for the government, the other governments respond urgently,\" he said.  Microsoft, which is supported in the case by companies including Google, Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., stores email content at more than 100 data centers in more than 40 countries. The company says it uses that many sites for the sake of speed, putting users as close as possible to their data.  Proposal in Congress  The government says that requesting assistance from other countries in gathering evidence can be a slow and difficult process. Fewer than half of the world\u2019s countries have treaties with the U.S. for providing such help.  Several of the Democratic-nominated justices expressed frustration with applying the the decades-old law to the era of cloud computing, suggesting they might prefer to wait for Congress to act on a pending bipartisan proposal to update the law.  Justice Sonia Sotomayor suggested to Deputy U.S. Solicitor General Michael Dreeben that the government\u2019s interpretation of the law would raise conflicts with the data privacy laws of other countries.  \"Why shouldn\u2019t we leave the status quo as it is and let Congress pass a bill in this new age that addresses the potential problems that your reading would create?\" Sotomayor asked, following up on a similar question from Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.  \u2018Break the Cloud\u2019  Rosenkranz, the Microsoft lawyer, told the justices that a ruling could damage the standing of the U.S. as the world leader in the multibillion-dollar cloud computing business.  \"If you try to tinker with this without the tools that -- that only Congress has, you are as likely to break the cloud as you are to fix it,\" he said.  Attending Tuesday\u2019s argument was Republican Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, a cosponsor of the bipartisan measure, which would let the U.S. make formal agreements with other countries for cross-border requests for digital evidence. After the argument, Hatch said in a statement, \"It\u2019s no surprise that throughout this morning\u2019s oral argument, justices continually referred to the importance of action from Congress.\"  The case is United States v.

The figure was cited by plaintiffs suing Microsoft for systematically denying pay raises or promotions to women at the world's largest software company. Microsoft denies it had any such policy.  The lawsuit, filed in Seattle federal court in 2015, is attracting wider attention after a series of powerful men have left or been fired from their jobs in entertainment, the media and politics for sexual misconduct.  Plaintiffs' attorneys are pushing to proceed as a class action lawsuit, which could cover more than 8,000 women. More details about Microsoft's human resources practices were made public on Monday in legal filings submitted as part of that process.  The two sides are exchanging documents ahead of trial, which has not been scheduled.  Out of 118 gender discrimination complaints filed by women at Microsoft, only one was deemed \"founded\" by the company, according to details in the unsealed court filings.  Attorneys for the women called the number of complaints \"shocking\" in the court filings and the response by Microsoft's investigations team \"lackluster.\"  Companies generally keep information about internal discrimination complaints private, so it is unclear how the number of complaints at Microsoft compares to competitors.  Microsoft said in court filings that the plaintiffs did not identify practices that impact enough employees to warrant a class action, and that it spends more than $55 million per year to promote diversity and inclusion. The company had about 74,000 U.S. employees at the end of last year.  Microsoft said the plaintiffs cannot cite one example of a pay or promotion problem in which Microsoft's investigations team should have found a violation of company policy, but did not. A Microsoft spokesperson could not immediately be reached for comment.  U.S. District Judge James Robart has not yet ruled on the plaintiffs' request for class action status.  A Reuters review of federal court cases filed between 2006 and 2016 revealed hundreds containing sexual harassment allegations where companies used common civil litigation tactics to keep potentially damning information under wraps.  Microsoft had argued that the number of womens' human resources complaints should be kept secret because publicizing the outcomes could deter employees from reporting future abuses.  A court-appointed official found that scenario \"far too remote a competitive or business harm\" to justify keeping the information sealed.

Microsoft  While Microsoft dominates the global market for classroom PCs, Google Chrome OS rules the roost in the United States.  Microsoft is teaming up with partners including Lenovo to bring a new line of cheap, sub-$300 PCs to market, to take on Google's low-cost Chromebooks.  Microsoft says that a Windows PC is more capable than a Chromebook \u2014 Windows 10 lets you run software like Minecraft or the full version of Microsoft Office.  Minecraft is getting a new chemistry module for students.  Google has all but captured the market for American classrooms \u2014 analyst firm Futuresource estimates that in the third quarter of 2017, Google's low-cost Chromebooks accounted for 59.8% of the laptop market for K-12 education, compared to Microsoft Windows devices' 22.3% share.  But Microsoft would be quick to remind you that this doesn't tell the whole story: That 22.3% share is up from 18.4% the quarter before, and Microsoft says, up 4% from the same period in 2016. And, worldwide, Windows still reigns supreme: In that same third quarter of 2017, Windows accounted for 66.5% of global K-12 classroom PC shipments.  Now, Microsoft is striking back against Google's domestic dominance, with a series of announcements designed to make Windows PCs, Microsoft Office 365, and even the Minecraft video game sensation more appealing for education customers at home and abroad.  Chief among those announcements: New laptops for the classroom, priced between $189 and $299, manufactured by partners Lenovo and JP. These laptops will run Windows 10 S, a version of the operating system streamlined for better battery life and performance \u2014 at the big tradeoff of only being able to install apps from the Microsoft Store.  Microsoft Corporate VP Yusuf Mehdi tells Business Insider that Microsoft is trying to undercut the price advantage of Chromebooks, which often sell for under $299. But because these PCs can run the full versions of Windows software, including Microsoft Office and Minecraft, they offer \"none of the compromises of a Chromebook.\"  Mehdi gives Google credit where he believes credit is due: He says that Chromebooks didn't actually steal any marketshare away from Microsoft, per se; Google just discovered a previously-unmet demand for low-priced laptops and \"made it affordable to have a computer in the classroom.\" And although Apple has had a strong business in schools, but its products are much more expensive.  A new Chemistry Module for Minecraft: Education Edition will let students play around with both atoms and chemical compounds, in the safety of the virtual world. Microsoft  Now, says Mehdi, the burden is on Microsoft to go out and prove that a Windows machine is more capable than a Chromebook of the same price. Many of the low-cost Windows devices announced on Monday will boast touchscreens and stylus support. Some, will even be compatible with certain virtual reality headsets, a feature schools love, Mehdi adds.  Beyond the hardware, Mehdi highlights updates to the software in the Office 365 for Education suite. For instance, the Microsoft Teams chat tool is getting an iOS and Android app for education users. And Minecraft: Education Edition, which is already widely used to teach programming, is getting a chemistry module for students to perform science experiments in the safety of the virtual world.  According to Futuresource, the time could be right for Microsoft, too: Many schools bought their Chromebooks for students in 2014 and 2015, meaning that they could be looking to do a wide-scale replacement in 2018. That's an opportunity for Microsoft to convince them to switch to Windows \u2014 an opportunity he says the company doesn't intend to squander.  \"We finally feel like we have a strong value proposition,\" says Mehdi.", "stock": "MSFT", "label": 1, "date": "2018-01-22", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-windows-10-versus-google-chromebooks-in-classroom-2018-1"}, {"article": "Microsoft\u2019s Slack competitor, Microsoft Teams, rolled out its biggest update since the software\u2019s launch last year, the company says. The focus of the new set of features is allowing users to better work with apps \u2013 something Microsoft Teams accomplishes via integrations, new search and discovery features, commands, and more.  Some of the features are, in fact, quite Slack-like.  For example, Microsoft Teams now offers a way to search for apps from the new app store where you can browse by category or search by name, category or integration type \u2013 like Project Management or BI. Slack, of course, also has its own app directory, which has allowed it to highlight all the work tools that currently work with its team collaboration resource \u2013 a move that helped it gain traction in the workplace.  In Microsoft\u2019s case, however, there\u2019s a bit more emphasis on the apps your organization has added and assigned to you, as well as those you regularly work with.  A new \u201cpersonal space\u201d displays all the items that you\u2019ve been assigned across your apps, like your tasks in Planner or issues in Jira Cloud, plus those from apps you\u2019ve recently accessed, like OneNote notebooks or videos from Microsoft Stream.  Microsoft even added its own new app called Who, powered by Microsoft Graph. This lets you search across your organization for people by name or topic.  The updated version of Teams also makes it easier to launch apps.  It\u2019s adding the ability to query or command an app from the command box to speed up the process of using the apps. That way, you can search for information from an app, then add a result right into your chat in a single workflow. This process will be improved in time, Microsoft says, and will eventually allow you to do more complex tasks, like creating a new task in your PM app or starting a build in Visual Studio Team Services.  Plus, adding information from an app to a chat has been improved \u2013 as you can now add an interactive card from apps into a chat or channel with just a click, instead of having to screenshot the data then post it.  Teams added slash commands with this update, too.  Similar to Slack, the slash command ( / ) lets you perform tasks or navigate Teams. But you can also use slash commands to do things like setting your status to \u201cAway,\u201d adding users to team, or calling a coworker, the company says.  This new set of features is rolling out starting today, says Microsoft, which means you may not see them immediately, but should soon.

It\u2019s worth stressing that the app isn\u2019t about replacing guide dogs or canes. Instead, it\u2019s all about enriching people\u2019s perception of their surroundings. A guide dog can\u2019t tell you that your favorite store is right around the corner if you\u2019re in an unfamiliar city or what street you are on, after all. With the app, users can set audio beacons for destinations and landmarks. Using GPS and the built-in compass in the phone, the app then generates its spatial audio cues. The mapping data is provided by OpenStreetMap.  \u201cObstacle avoidance is not the problem, we have a dog, a cane and our blindness skills for that,\u201d said Erin Lauridsen, Access Technology Director, LightHouse for the Blind in San Francisco in a blog post today. \u201cThe gap is knowing where things are and being able to decide what\u2019s of interest.\u201d  The app offers three modes: \u2018locate\u2019 tells you where you are, \u2018around me\u2019 calls out four points of interest around you and \u2018ahead of me\u2019 provides the names of five landmarks in front of you.  If some of this sounds familiar, that\u2019s probably because Microsoft has been working on this project for quite a while now. Back in 2014, the team was working with Windows Phone handsets and was experimenting with bone-conduction headsets. At the time, Microsoft was also hoping to use sensors and beacons in cities to provide additional information like bus arrival times. Today, Windows Phone is no more and the requirement of using a bone-conduction headset has been removed, but the general idea behind Soundscape has always remained the same.

And it\u2019s a move which has immediately been criticized by some Linux fans, as you can imagine, drawing comparisons with Microsoft and Windows 10 which has had an infamously checkered history regarding hoovering up user data.  Will Cooke, Ubuntu Desktop Manager at Canonical, explained that this is happening because the company wants to work on the elements that matter most to Ubuntu users, and the data collected will help the firm decide what to focus on going forward.  That data will include the version of Ubuntu being installed, basic spec of the PC \u2013 CPU family, memory, disk size, GPU, display resolution, manufacturer \u2013 along with details of the third-party software selected, and time taken for the installation, among other information.  The OS will also gather data on location, although this will simply be the location selected by the user during installation \u2013 no IP address information will be collected. In other words, the data collected will be completely anonymized, and transferred via HTTPS for obvious security reasons.  Cooke further explained that some manner of checkbox option would be added to the Ubuntu installer, asking whether the user wants to \u2018send diagnostics information to help improve Ubuntu\u2019, but that this would be ticked by default.  In other words, data collection would be an opt-out affair, rather than a decision to opt-in.  Trend spotting  You might be forgiven for thinking this is just a case of a one-time firing off of info post-installation of Ubuntu, but Canonical also intends to install Popcon on consenting user\u2019s PCs \u2013 to help pick out trends in package usage \u2013 along with Apport to send crash reports (anonymously).  All the data gathered, incidentally, would be made public, allowing everyone to see the percentages of Ubuntu users who use certain hardware.  As mentioned, there has been some predictably negative reaction in the chatter we\u2019ve seen online, with one of the main points of controversy being the fact that the default setting is on rather than off.  Although this is perhaps less of an issue for Linux users than, say, Windows, as generally speaking open source OS devotees are a bit more clued-up as to what they\u2019re doing during installation, and more likely to read prompts rather than gloss over things.  Still, that\u2019s not exactly an excuse for Canonical, and it would certainly look better if the scheme was opt-in, rather than opt-out. Incidentally, if you don\u2019t turn this feature off during installation, you\u2019ll be able to do so later on in Gnome\u2019s privacy panel.  Furthermore, bear in mind that this isn\u2019t going to happen for sure \u2013 it\u2019s just what Canonical is planning, so there could be a course change yet.  But if the move does go ahead as planned, it\u2019s likely that the top rival distros, such as Mint, Fedora and Debian, will be rubbing their hands together at a potential influx of new users migrating to a different flavor of Linux. For some folks, even the perception that Canonical is taking some steps down the same road as Microsoft will likely be too much to bear.

As we\u2019ve said before, there are notable issues with the new wave of so-called \u2018always connected\u2019 PCs \u2013 some of which are more obvious than others \u2013 and one of the main ones was the fact that these devices can only run 32-bit software, thus limiting the selection of applications available.  Microsoft had already said that this picture would change at some point in the future, and according to an Engadget report, Erin Chappie, general manager for Windows, confirmed that an ARM64 SDK will be officially announced at the upcoming Build conference which kicks off on May 7.  This SDK will be available for both UWP (Universal Windows Platform) apps as well as traditional desktop apps.  Developer\u2019s decision  However, pushing the kit out is just the first step in the process. Developers themselves will have to recompile their own applications for ARM64 compatibility, of course, and there\u2019s not much Microsoft can do if devs decide it\u2019s not worth the trouble.  That said, this is still a big step forward in opening up the number of potential apps which are available to those who have taken the plunge with a Snapdragon notebook, and at least the move is happening sooner rather than later.  The big selling point of these laptops like the HP Envy x2 is their extensive battery life (20 hours) and built-in LTE connectivity thanks to the Qualcomm chip inside.  However, there are question marks over the sort of performance you\u2019ll see from 64-bit apps, and concerns about the power available from the Snapdragon 835 which powers the first wave of notebooks.

So, if you\u2019ve held off from installing previous titled Windows 10 updates on account of their lengthy installation times, Microsoft wants to do better by you. The company made the announcement as part of a Windows Insider blog post , showcasing gradual improvement over the past few major Windows 10 updates.  For instance, Microsoft admitted a total \u2018offline\u2019 installation time of 82 minutes on average back when the Creators Update of April 2017, which improved to 51 minutes with the Fall Creators Update of October 2017. Now, within Insider Preview builds, the company says to have pared this down time to just 30 minutes on average.  Offline time goes online  To explain why we\u2019re quoting the word \u2018offline\u2019 here, Microsoft looks at operating system (OS) installations occurring in two different states: online and offline. What you might consider the OS installation, the growing percentage atop a blue screen, is just this \u2018offline\u2019 state \u2013 a considerable amount of installation is done while you\u2019re still using the computer, before it restarts.  \u2018Online\u2019 in this context includes anything that\u2019s done in the background while the computer is still in use, before the restarts begin. Meanwhile, \u2018offline\u2019 includes everything that\u2019s done either just before or after the computer restarts, usually on a blue screen.  To achieve these faster installation times, Microsoft has gradually moved more of these \u2018offline\u2019 processes into the \u2018online\u2019 category, particularly now that \u2018user content is prepared for migration\u2019 and the \u2018new operating system is placed into a temporary working directory\u2019 during this first phase, as per Microsoft\u2019s blog post.  So, if you \u2013 like most of the world \u2013 consider the \u2018offline\u2019 state of an OS installation the whole kit and kaboodle, then Windows 10 installations just got a helluva lot faster.  As Microsoft likes to brag, these changes have reduced the overall \u2018offline\u2019 \u2013 again, the time in which you cannot interact with the computer \u2013 installation time to not much longer than, yes, making a sandwich.

Alphabet, the parent company of search-engine giant Google, became the second publicly traded U.S. company ever to reach a market value of $800 billion Monday, joining iPhone maker Apple. Alphabet\u2019s Class A shares rose 1.8% to $1,164.00.  Meantime, Microsoft was on track Monday to become the third public U.S. company ever to close with a market value of $700 billion, joining Apple and Alphabet. Shares rose as much as 1.4% to $91.23 and were recently up 1.2%. On Jan. 16, Microsoft briefly touched $700 billion before falling back below that level.  Alphabet has already added about $74 billion in market capitalization this year as of midday Monday, while Microsoft is up about $43 billion, a combined total of $117 billion in added market value for the two tech giants since the start of 2018.  Apple crossed the $700 billion threshold in February 2015 and passed $800 billion and $900 billion last year. It hit that last milestone shortly after Alphabet hit $700 billion.  Monday\u2019s fresh highs are the latest major markers hit by U.S. internet giants in the past year. Investors have flocked to the largest technology firms for their ability to grow revenue despite mixed economic data. Some analysts have said they expect recent gains and lofty valuations in the S&P 500 information technology sector\u2014which is up 42% in the past year\u2014have left the grouping vulnerable to a pullback, but technology stocks have still been among the best performers at the start of 2018.  On Jan. 8, e-commerce firm Amazon.com crossed $600 billion for the first time.  Microsoft\u2019s recent rise has come as the software giant continues to prioritize cloud computing. Microsoft\u2019s next earnings report is expected at the end of the month.  Alphabet has surged over the past year as advertisers spend more and more money on its platforms. Google and Facebook controlled nearly two-thirds of total digital ad spending last year, according to eMarketer, and Alphabet has taken another leg higher in the first days of 2018 as Facebook shares have stumbled on speculation that the retooling of its platform will hurt its advertising revenue.  Although some analysts have said they expect investors to begin to move money out of the tech sector, few think technology stocks are anywhere close to the froth from the dot-com bubble. Microsoft\u2019s recent climb to $600 billion, a mark it also hit in the late 1990s before falling, took much longer than its first ascent.  It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess what the next technology market-cap milestone will be.

In one way it\u2019s the best: By nearly eliminating the bezel around the display, Dell squeezed the XPS 13 into a smaller body than all of its competitors. Without those big borders, the screen just looks better. The XPS 13 scored the second-best time in my battery tests, it has all the right chips and features, and it looks like it cost good money.  But\u2026 that tiny bezel forced Dell to move the webcam down below the screen, which is a terrible place. Rather than framing my face, the camera stares up my nose. (Dell says most users don\u2019t mind the placement.)  The bigger problem is that the XPS 13 you want costs $1,200. The standard model comes with a paltry four gigs of RAM and 128 gigs of storage\u2014neither of which will suffice.  Microsoft | Surface Pro $958 Battery Looks Power  Versatility  PROS  CONS  Hard to use on your lap; low-end processor  Light, thin and versatile; most tablet-like of the bunch  The Portable One  Like the best camera, the best laptop is the one you have with you. No Windows computer combines portability and functionality quite like Microsoft Corp.\u2019s Surface Pro, the tablet/laptop hybrid that inspired so many competitors. It\u2019s the size and shape of an iPad, with the full power of Windows.  Unfortunately, all that versatility compromises the Surface Pro\u2019s utility, and I don\u2019t just mean the smaller screen. And, because the crucial keyboard accessory sells separately for $160, it\u2019s deceptively expensive. (I\u2019ve included it in my pricing, because you need it.) The only way to hit the $1,000 target and still get the whole kit is to buy the cheapest model, which uses a vastly underpowered processor. You might opt for Microsoft\u2019s other offering in this range, the Surface Laptop but, as comfortable as it is to use, it doesn\u2019t measure up to my other picks.  | Swift 3 Acer $999 Battery Looks Power  Versatility  PROS  CONS  Big and heavy; more desktop than laptop  Lots of ports; big screen and roomy keyboard  The Powerful One  Many laptops in this price range offer enough processing oomph for web browsing, Netflixing and Exceling, but not gamer-grade horsepower. Acer Inc.\u2019s Swift 3 does a little better. Its Core i7 processor, more powerful than you\u2019ll often find at this price, makes the machine more suitable for Photoshop users or inveterate tab-hoarders. Just don\u2019t expect it to run \u201cFortnite.\u201d  Acer also added a large selection of ports to the Swift 3 and a relatively large 14-inch display. But all that extra stuff makes it larger and heavier than my other picks. It works as a stashable in-home family PC, but by today\u2019s standards, it isn\u2019t especially mobile.  Lenovo | Yoga 720 $989 Battery Looks Power  Versatility  PROS  CONS  Shallow keyboard; subpar speakers  Light and flexible; often cheapest of the bunch  The Affordable One  Lenovo Group Ltd.\u2019s Yoga 720 has almost everything you\u2019d want in a laptop, and I\u2019ve seen it on sale for as little as $750. Its screen back flips to lie flat against the keyboard so you can hold it like a tablet. It\u2019s fast enough, lasts long enough and looks good enough.  My issues with the Yoga individually feel minor: The speakers sound mushy, the keyboard is a bit shallow, the design is bland. Together, they make clear why the 720 is cheaper than the others: It\u2019s a good computer for the price, but if you spend more on something else, you\u2019ll be glad.  HP | Spectre x360 $999 Battery Looks Power  Versatility  PROS  CONS  Gets dirty easily; uneven keyboard backlight  Clean, attractive look; excellent keyboard  The Best One  If all you want is to stop reading and just buy a new computer, here\u2019s your answer: The best $1,000 Windows computer is HP\u2019s latest Spectre x360, a machine that does everything well. We\u2019ve been recommending this line for a few years now, and HP just keeps improving it.  The x360 checks all the spec boxes, looks as good as anything out of Cupertino, Calif., and is enjoyable to use, from the speakers to the keyboard. It has a 360-degree hinge that flips the laptop into a tablet for drawing or using in a cramped space. It uses new USB-C ports for charging and data, but also offers an older-style standard USB-A port.  In my testing, the x360\u2019s biggest problem has been the lid\u2019s tendency to scuff in my bag. It came in third on my super-harsh battery test, behind the Surface Pro and nearly in line with the Dell: You should have no trouble using it through a workday. It\u2019s not rich with new ideas about what computers can be, but when you have work to do, that isn\u2019t the priority. You just want a laptop, and HP made a terrific one.

Microsoft lawyer Joshua Rosenkranz, left, and Brad Smith, the company\u2019s president and chief legal officer, speaking to reporters Tuesday following oral arguments at the Supreme Court. Photo: Drew Angerer/Getty Images  WASHINGTON\u2014Supreme Court justices voiced concern Tuesday that Microsoft Corp.\u2019s MSFT -0.53% resistance to U.S. search warrants for customer emails stored overseas would hamper criminal investigations, in a case that pits leading tech companies against law enforcement.  During an hourlong oral argument, the court considered whether email providers like Microsoft, Yahoo and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s GOOGL -0.12% Google have to comply with warrants if the government is seeking email messages and other digital files that are stored on computer servers outside the U.S.  Several justices said it wasn\u2019t ideal that the case was controlled by a 1986 federal law on electronic records that Congress adopted before email and cloud-computing were part of the social fabric. Still, the court appeared to be searching for a way to interpret the outdated law that wouldn\u2019t rob the government of tools to investigate crimes with a digital trail that crossed U.S. borders.  \u201cThis is what troubles me,\u201d Justice Samuel Alito said. \u201cIt would be good if Congress enacted legislation that modernized this. But in the interim, something has to be done.\u201d  The justices were reviewing a lower-court ruling Microsoft won in 2016 that clipped the Justice Department\u2019s authority to obtain overseas emails. The battle dates back to 2013 when the U.S. got a warrant that ordered Microsoft to hand over messages in an email account that was linked to narcotics trafficking. Microsoft argued the warrant wasn\u2019t valid because the emails were stored in Ireland.  Microsoft lawyer Joshua Rosenkranz argued the 1986 law, called the Stored Communications Act, didn\u2019t allow the U.S. government \u201cto unilaterally reach into a foreign land to search for, copy, and import private customer correspondence\u201d that is stored on a foreign computer and protected by foreign law.  Chief Justice John Roberts, however, said Microsoft was a U.S.-based company and had control over where it chose to store emails and other consumer data.  Newsletter Sign-up  \u201cIt\u2019s not the government\u2019s fault that it\u2019s located overseas,\u201d the chief justice said. He added that if Microsoft prevailed, nothing would prevent the company from moving the emails of U.S. customers to overseas servers to protect their data from disclosure.  \u201cYou might gain customers if you can assure them, no matter what happens, the government won\u2019t be able to get access to their emails,\u201d Chief Justice Roberts said.  Mr. Rosenkranz said such a scenario \u201cwould never happen\u201d because Microsoft relies upon U.S. facilities to provide the best and fastest service to 200 million domestic customers. People who are intent on hiding their correspondence from the government \u201cdon\u2019t use Microsoft\u2019s services,\u201d he said.  Mr. Rosenkranz also warned the court that a win for the government could do serious harm to the U.S. tech sector. \u201cIf you try to tinker with this without the tools that only Congress has, you are as likely to break the cloud as you are to fix it,\u201d he said.  Google, which has waged similar battles with the government, and an array of other leading tech companies are supporting Microsoft in the case.  Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg suggested the wait-for-Congress approach had some appeal.  \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be wiser just to say, \u2018Let\u2019s leave things as they are\u2014if Congress wants to regulate in this brave new world, it should do it\u2019?\u201d Justice Ginsburg asked.  Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah), who attended the oral argument, recently proposed bipartisan legislation to update the law and give law enforcement access to overseas customer data, while also providing protections for email and cloud computing providers. It isn\u2019t clear if, or when, lawmakers may move forward on such a bill.  No justice during Monday\u2019s session clearly embraced Microsoft\u2019s reading of the 1986 law. Nor did the justices echo concerns about customer privacy that have been voiced by the tech industry.  The government noted that investigators would still have to get a warrant to see the emails.  \u201cIt\u2019s not a case about privacy,\u201d Justice Department lawyer Michael Dreeben told the court. \u201cThe government has the gold standard of an instrument to address privacy interests here\u2014a probable-cause-based warrant issued by a judge that describes with particularity what we want.\u201d  Mr. Dreeben said the lower-court ruling in Microsoft\u2019s favor \u201chas caused grave and immediate harm to the government\u2019s ability to enforce federal criminal law.\u201d  A decision is expected by the end of June.

Epic Games Inc., creator of the popular combat game, had accidentally flipped a switch of sorts, letting people using Microsoft Corp.\u2019s Xbox One play alongside those using Sony Corp.\u2019s PlayStation 4.  \u201cThis is HUGE,\u201d a person wrote on Reddit. It didn\u2019t last.  Epic said it turned off \u201ccross-play\u201d once it discovered the error, the latest roadblock to a dream feature for gamers that is technologically possible but frustratingly elusive.  The major console makers\u2014Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo Co. \u2014have long supported cross-play between their machines and personal computers, and more recently with mobile devices.  But the three don\u2019t always play well together, creating headaches for friends who own different consoles and game developers who say the block limits the potential to expand their audiences.  Players of \u2018Fortnite,\u2019 by Epic Games, have been vocal about requesting a cross-play feature. Photo: Epic Games  Matthew Ross, a 30-year-old graphic designer in State College, Pa., usually plays games with strangers because he owns a PlayStation 4 and most of his friends have an Xbox One. \u201cIt\u2019s infuriating,\u201d he said.  Recently, the friends agreed not to buy a new Capcom Co. game, \u201cMonster Hunter: World,\u201d for their consoles. Instead, they are waiting for it to come out for PCs in the fall so they can play together, Mr. Ross said.  People playing the same game on different hardware can link up online, provided the developer has built software to allow the two systems to talk to each other. But the developer would still need each hardware makers\u2019 blessing.  At around 2 a.m. ET Thursday, more than 600,000 people tuned into Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s Twitch live-streaming platform to watch rapper Drake play \u201cFortnite\u201d on a PlayStation 4 with a popular streamer who was using a PC. The live stream, which handily beat the previous Twitch record for simultaneous viewers on the channel of an individual broadcaster, occurred days after Epic said it would enable both PlayStation 4 and Xbox users to play against people on PCs and mobile devices\u2014though not against each other.  Epic\u2019s announcement prompted a \u201cFortnite\u201d player on Twitter to implore Phil Spencer, Microsoft\u2019s head of games, to add cross-play with Sony\u2019s console. \u201cWe really want cross-play system between XB1 and PS4,\u201d the tweeter said.  \u201cMe 2,\u201d Mr. Spencer tweeted back minutes later. The next day, the official account for \u201cFortnite\u201d chimed in: \u201cWe 3.\u201d  \u201cFortnite\u201d isn\u2019t playable across the two systems because both Sony and Microsoft would need to allow it. Sony declined to comment.  It isn\u2019t the first time Sony has been accused of standing in the way. Last year, Psyonix Inc. sought to make its car-soccer game \u201cRocket League\u201d playable across consoles. Microsoft and Nintendo signed up. Sony demurred.  \u201cIt\u2019s extremely frustrating,\u201d Psyonix Chief Executive Dave Hagewood said.  Game developers have good reason to want cross-play, Benchmark Co. analyst Mike Hickey said. \u201cYou\u2019re less likely to go play another game if your buddies are all playing together,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re more engaged, you\u2019re more likely to spend money\u201d on virtual goodies inside the game, he said.  Prohibiting cross-play can be advantageous for a console maker: Shoppers might be inclined to choose the system that friends own, said Piper Jaffray analyst Mike Olson. That tips the scales in favor of the market leader, which right now is Sony\u2019s PlayStation 4.  Microsoft hasn\u2019t always supported cross-play. In 2011, when its Xbox Live service dominated online console games, a company representative told the website Kotaku that Microsoft wasn\u2019t on board, because it couldn\u2019t guarantee players on competing systems would get the same level of quality as on Xbox 360.  Microsoft said the company\u2019s position has evolved as an increasing number of people play games across multiple devices.  Corrections & Amplifications  At around 2 a.m. ET Thursday, more than 600,000 people tuned into Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s Twitch live-streaming platform to watch rapper Drake play \u201cFortnite\u201d on a \u200bPlayStation 4 with a popular streamer who was using a \u200bPC.

The envisioned changes are an outgrowth of Google\u2019s AMP project, or accelerated mobile pages, Aakash Sahney, a product manager overseeing Gmail, said in a blog post Tuesday.  AMP is a set of programming intended to make webpages load faster by stripping out layers of technology.  It has drawn praise from publishers such as Hearst Corp and the Washington Post for making their websites more inviting for users. But some web developers have expressed concern that Google is getting too much say in how the web operates.  Google is pushing forward. The Gmail integration marks the first broader use for AMP. Other email providers can adopt AMP as well, Google announced as it kicks off an AMP-focused conference for software developers in Amsterdam.  The initial version of AMP for email is aimed at bulk senders. A retailer, for example, that sends a weekly sales notice could ensure that recipients see the current price or availability of an item no matter when the email is opened.  Bookmarking service Pinterest, scheduling app Doodle and Priceline Group Inc\u2019s Booking.com are testing AMP for email, according to Google.", "stock": "GOOGL", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-13", "source": "reuters", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/alphabet-gmail/google-to-debut-emails-that-automatically-update-idUSL2N1Q217R"}, {"article": "Paris is gaining ground as a European hub for artificial intelligence research as Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and Facebook Inc. pledge to hire staff and invest in labs, after their top executives met with French President Emmanuel Macron.  Google said it will create an AI lab dedicated to fundamental research on themes like automatic learning, language and a computer\u2019s ability to see, with the aim of applying findings to fields from health to the environment. The end-goal is to grow this group to a size similar to Google\u2019s existing team of 120 engineers who do applied research in Paris, working on developments for Chrome and YouTube, a company spokeswoman said.  Facebook, which already has an artificial intelligence lab in Paris, said it will double the team there to 100 people by 2022 and spend 10 million euros ($12.2 million) on items including hardware equipment. Both announcements came as part of a broader series of promises by these companies to increase budgets in France, with Google and Facebook also separately vowing to train citizens on digital tools.  \u201cFrance has all the assets to succeed. It has top engineers, great  entrepreneurs, one of the best education systems in the world, great infrastructure, and successful global companies,\u201d Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai wrote in a blog post. He reaffirmed a broader hiring target to reach 1,000 employees at Google\u2019s headquarters in the French capital, from 700 today.  Pichai and Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg are guests of Macron\u2019s on Monday, among 140 top executives from a variety of industries. In Versailles, company chiefs were invited to attend presentations by ministers, as well as private meetings and dinner with the president -- a full-fledged investor roadshow meant to convince CEOs to invest more in France, as they prepare to head to Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum.  SAP SE CEO Bill McDermott is also on the guest list. Europe\u2019s biggest software company said it will invest 2 billion euros over five years in France on research and development, as well as backing and acquiring startups.  SAP also announced Monday it\u2019s buying a French company called Recast.AI that specializes in artificial intelligence. Recast.AI, which develops conversational chatbots, will be part of SAP\u2019s efforts to add voice recognition to its products.  Macron\u2019s strategy to woo investors and bring more funds to the French ecosystem dates back before his days as president, and tech has always been at the core of it. When he was still economy minister two years ago, Macron used the grandeur of Versailles to try and convince technology-focused venture-capitalists, including Andreessen Horowitz and Accel Partners, that France is a good place for their money.  The French president has also expressed the goal of establishing France and Europe as leaders in global artificial intelligence innovation, to rival the U.S. and China. France is waiting for a report by member of Parliament, Cedric Villani, expected soon, before it unveils a national strategy on AI.  Still, Macron has toughened his stance on technology companies in recent months on issues like taxes. He brought it up with Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook during a meeting at the French presidential palace in September.  Taxation of tech companies will be part of talks in Versailles Monday, but they\u2019re not the reason for Macron\u2019s meetings with Pichai, Sandberg and others, according to an official at the president\u2019s office.  The dinner will be held at the Gallery of Great Battles in the Versailles Palace, where Macron hosted Russian President Vladimir Putin last year.

Google\u2019s firing of an engineer over his controversial memo criticizing its diversity policies and \u201cpolitically correct monoculture\u201d didn\u2019t violate U.S. labor law, a federal agency lawyer concluded.  Statements in James Damore\u2019s 3,000-word memo \u201cregarding biological differences between the sexes were so harmful, discriminatory, and disruptive\u201d that they fell outside protections for collective action in the workplace, an associate general counsel for the National Labor Relations Board wrote in a six-page memo disclosed Thursday.  Damore withdrew his complaint in January and his lawyer has said she\u2019s focusing instead on the engineer\u2019s lawsuit accusing the internet giant of harassing him and others over their conservative political views.  When he was dismissed in August, Damore accused Google of violating the employee right to engage in \"concerted activity\" to address workplace issues, a category which the labor board has found can include forms of activism ranging from lawsuits to strikes to social media posts.  \u201cMuch of\" Damore\u2019s memo was probably protected under the law, the labor board\u2019s attorney, Jayme Sophir, said in the Jan. 16 memo. But Sophir went on to find that Google discharged Damore only for his \"discriminatory statements,\" which aren\u2019t shielded by labor law.  Because companies have a duty to comply with equal employment laws and an interest in promoting diversity, \u201cemployers must be permitted to \u2018nip in the bud\u2019 the kinds of employee conduct that could lead to a \u2018hostile workplace,\u2019 rather than waiting until an actionable hostile workplace has been created before taking action,\" Sophir wrote.  The company \u201ccarefully tailored\" its messages in firing Damore and in addressing employees afterward \"to affirm their right to engage in protected speech while prohibiting discrimination or harassment.\" Google also disciplined one of Damore\u2019s co-workers for sending him a threatening email in response to the memo, Sophir said.  Fired Google Engineer Faces Headwinds Seeking Legal Recourse  Google declined to comment on Sophir\u2019s memo. Damore\u2019s attorney didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.  The labor board lawyer\u2019s conclusion is \"consistent with board precedent for decades, which has viewed speech which creates a hostile environment likely to produce both discord and divisiveness as unprotected,\" said William Gould IV, who chaired the board under President Bill Clinton.  \"In the course of protesting working conditions you can be profane and aggressive and unpleasant, you can be militant, and it\u2019s still protected,\" Gould said.

The effort has had mixed results, at best, in the past.  With a trade war brewing between the world\u2019s two largest economies, the goal has gotten loftier still.  Tim Cook, chief executive officer of Apple, Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, and Ginny Rometty, head of IBM, are scheduled to attend the China Development Forum, an annual gathering that helps Western corporations build relationships with the country\u2019s government officials.  Cook is co-chairing the event this year, and Apple has the most at stake in China among U.S. tech companies. Its iPhones and other gadgets have sold well in the country, but revenue from the region fell in Apple\u2019s last fiscal year. The Cupertino, California-based company has also been criticized recently for relocating the data of Chinese iCloud users to state-controlled server farms.  Last year, International Business Machines Corp. announced a deal with Chinese company Wanda Group at the forum. The deal was meant to help IBM expand in the country\u2019s cloud market, though Caixin reported recently that Wanda would stop working with the U.S. company.  Google pulled out of mainland China in 2010 over government censorship of its search results. The company has been trying to return in recent years, but has made little progress.  These hurdles will only get higher if a trade war erupts between the U.S. and China. On Thursday, President Donald Trump ordered 25 percent tariffs on at least $50 billion of Chinese imports, including information and communication technology. He also accused China of stealing intellectual property. China responded with its own duties on some U.S. imports.  Apple could see a negative effect on about 15 percent of its business if China were to retaliate with duties on imports of U.S. products, Loup Ventures\u2019 Gene Munster said in an email earlier on Thursday.  Steve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm\u2019s CEO, will attend the conference but has canceled his plan to speak.  The conference comes just days after Bloomberg News reported that Chinese regulators are seeking more protections for local companies before approving Qualcomm\u2019s proposed purchase of NXP Semiconductors NV. China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce isn\u2019t satisfied with the remedies that Qualcomm has offered so far and has told the company to propose more, people familiar with the matter have said.  China is the world\u2019s biggest market for smartphones and a crucial customer base of Qualcomm\u2019s chips for mobile phones. The San Diego, California-based company won the right to extend its technology licensing business in China in 2015 after paying a fine and agreeing to charge lower rates to local customers on phones for that market.  \u2014 With assistance by Mark Bergen, Ian King, and Gerrit De Vynck", "stock": "GOOGL", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-23", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-23/apple-google-ibm-ceos-head-to-china-with-trade-war-brewing"}, {"article": "Google Inc. is set for its first battle in a London court over the so-called \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d in two cases that will test the boundaries between personal privacy and public interest.  Two anonymous people, who describe themselves in court filings as businessmen, want the search engine to take down links to information about their old convictions.  One of the men had been found guilty of conspiracy to account falsely, and the other of conspiracy to intercept communications, Judge Matthew Nicklin said at a pre-trial hearing Thursday. Those convictions are old and are now covered by an English law -- designed to rehabilitate offenders -- that says they can effectively be ignored. With a few exceptions, they don\u2019t have to be disclosed to potential employers.  \u201cThis is the first time that the English court is going to decide the issue of the right to be forgotten,\u201d Nicklin said.  The search-engine giant has already become embroiled in battles at the European Union\u2019s top court over the right to be forgotten. The principle -- created by the EU\u2019s highest court in a precedent-setting ruling in May 2014 -- allows people to ask for links to online information about them to be removed from search results if it\u2019s outdated or irrelevant. The ruling is only valid in the 28-nation bloc, but Google has clashed with privacy regulators over attempts to apply it beyond the EU.  \u201cWe work hard to comply with the right to be forgotten, but we take great care not to remove search results that are clearly in the public interest and will defend the public\u2019s right to access lawful information,\u201d a Google spokeswoman said.  Lawyers for the plaintiffs didn\u2019t comment.  Not Celebrities  Nicklin said Thursday that while the two cases were not related, they raised the same legal issues. The first trial, in which the person challenging Google to remove information is known as NT1, will start on Feb. 27 and the second, in which the plaintiff is known as NT2, will start on March 13. Nicklin said the plaintiffs weren\u2019t celebrities or politicians and have been \u201crehabilitated\u201d since their convictions.  NT1 has been threatened in public places by people referring to the content that Google links to, \u201cand seeking to extract money from him in consequence,\u201d his court filings say. He \u201chas been and continues to be treated as a pariah in his personal, business and social life and has been unable to form any new friendships or personal relationships,\u201d they say.  \u2018Adverse Attention\u2019  NT2\u2019s papers say some financial institutions are unwilling to deal with him \u201con private or commercial business\u201d after looking him up on Google. The search engine results have attracted \u201cadverse attention\u201d to him and by association to members of his close family.  The case concerns an \u201carea of the law in which two human rights come into conflict,\u201d Nicklin said. \u201cThe right to be forgotten is a dimension of the right to privacy and it conflicts with the right of freedom of expression.\u201d  He said a U.K. law from 1974 meant that, for all but the most serious offenses, people with convictions shouldn\u2019t \u201chave a lifelong \u2018blot\u2019 on their record but should be able to live without that shadow.\u201d The internet \u201cprovides a challenge\u201d to that right, he said, but also noted that some people were concerned that the right to be forgotten \u201cmight lead, in effect, to censorship.\u201d  Google has \u201cstaked quite a lot of resources\u201d on trying to do a good job of deciding when to approve requests for links to be taken down, said George Brock, a journalism professor at City, University of London and the author of a 2016 book about the right to be forgotten. He said Google had been \u201copaque\u201d about its approach to making those decisions. If this case shed light on how it reached the decisions, \u201cit would be a real breakthrough,\u201d he said.  Super-Injunctions  The men are being represented by the law firm Carter Ruck. It has defended clients in privacy and libel actions and was one of the first firms to use super-injunctions, court orders that prevent publication of any confidential information relating to a person or an issue and also any existence of the order itself.  The pair\u2019s court papers say that revealing their identity would \u201cdefeat the object of the claims.\u201d  Google has publicly raised the alarm about risks to freedom of speech that it says are posed by the right to be forgotten. Two separate European Court of Justice cases about that right \u201crepresent a serious assault on the public\u2019s right to access lawful information,\u201d Google\u2019s general counsel, Kent Walker, said in a blog post in November.

Google was a big early investor in Uber.  Kalanick described his early relationship with Google founder Larry Page as little brother/big brother.  And then he discussed how it disintegrated as Google started to compete with Uber.  Uber's former CEO Travis Kalanick took the stand this week in San Francisco to defend Uber in a lawsuit brought by Waymo. Waymo, the self-driving car startup spun out of Google parent Alphabet, is suing Uber, alleging Uber stole its trade secrets. Uber contends it did not steal those trade secrets.  In some ways, this trial is like an ugly Silicon Valley divorce. Google was actually one of Uber's early big investors. Back in 2013, Google Ventures invested $258 million into Uber, which was its largest investment to date. Google senior vice president David Drummond also joined Uber's board.  \"We got an investment from Google. I was meeting with Larry Page. They picked me up in a self-driving car and I was like, 'that's pretty cool,'\" Kalanick testified, according to the live tweets from the trial by Recode's Johana Bhuiyan\u200f.  \"The general understanding is Google is doing this self driving thing. Uber is doing this ride share thing. Maybe we can partner up,\" Kalanick testified.  In those days, Kalanick looked up to Page and Drummond, he said.  \"It was kind of like little brother/big brother ... kind of hard to grok now. I looked at David Drummond and Larry Page kind of like big brothers ... maybe trying to get more time than they were trying to give.\"  But then Google grew increasingly interested in launching its own Uber competitor. Kalanick grew worried about Google's plans when its star self-driving engineer Chris Urmson was openly talking about creating a self-driving robot taxi fleet at the Detroit auto show in January 2015. Kalanick asked Drummond to set up a meeting with Larry Page about it, according to emails shared at the trial.  A few months later, an increasingly freaked out Kalanick asked for a meeting again, telling Drummond, \"A meeting with with Larry could calm this down if it's not true, but he has been avoiding any meeting with me since last fall. Without any dialogue, we get pushed into the assumption that Google is competing in the short term and has probably been planning to do so for quite a bit longer than has been let on.\"  Meanwhile, Kalanick wasn't waiting for that meeting. Uber had gone on a hiring binge of robotics engineers from Carnegie Mellon University.  When Kalanick did finally meet with Page, the two were already at odds, Kalanick testified, describing the meeting like this: \"Larry was fairly upset with us about us acquiring the CMU team ... He was sort of a little angsty and said 'why are you doing my thing?'\"  By August 2016, with the Waze carpooling service expanding in the Bay Area and Uber going fully into developing self-driving cars, Drummond left Uber's board, citing increasing conflicts of interest.  Later that month, Uber bought the self-driving truck startup of former star Google self-driving engineer Anthony Levandowski. Shortly after that, Waymo sued Uber.  Fast forward to the middle of 2017 and this lawsuit was one of the major reasons Kalanick lost his job as CEO of Uber last year, according to Benchmark, the investor that orchestrated his ousting.", "stock": "GOOGL", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-07", "source": "business-insider", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/travis-kalanick-thought-of-larry-page-like-a-big-brother-2018-2"}, {"article": "Before Google had its way with the three photos. malletsdarker / imgur  Google Photos occasionally uses AI to suggest edited photos to users on the platform.

This allows customers to shop their site through the Google Express app or by saying things like \u201cbuy peanut butter from Walmart,\u201d to place a quick voice order with Google Assistant\u2019s help.  Those partnerships, and the new program being introduced today, also allows retailers to increase shopper loyalty by supporting things like 1-click re-ordering, personalized recommendations, and basket-building, says Google. For example, if a customer integrates their Ultamate Rewards account (Ulta\u2019s loyalty program) with Google, it will know what other products to recommend based on past order history when the shopper is searching for a particular item.  Google says it will use a pay-per-sale model, which means it\u2019s only taking a cut of the sale when a shopper makes a purchase. That\u2019s different from Google\u2019s pay-per-click ads, where businesses pay when a web searcher engages with an ad by visiting the website or calling the business.  According to Google, retail partners saw the average size of a customer\u2019s shopping basket increase by 30 percent after joining the program, and Ulta saw average order values increase 35 percent. Target, which has been live for 6 months, says its Google Express shopping baskets increased nearly 20 percent, on average.

At the time, however, it had only been available in English. Today, it\u2019s offered on iOS in English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese (Brazil) and Spanish, Google notes.

The New York Times is reporting this morning that the technology giant is selling off the company to The Infatuation, a review site founded nine years back by former music execs.  The company had been rumored to be courting a buyer since early this year. As Reuters noted at the time, Zagat has increasingly become less of a focus for Google, as the company began growing its database of restaurant recommendations organically. Zagat, meanwhile, has lost much of the shine it had when Google purchased it nearly a decade ago.  Services like Yelp and the like have found more efficient methods for crowdsourcing customer opinions. That manner of content has become increasingly important for driving services like Google Maps, which incorporates it directly into its location services. Zagat was initially used to help overhaul the restaurant offerings in Google+, as the company was hoping to build a legitimate Facebook competitor.  Over the years, Google\u2019s involvement in the company\u2019s public facing offerings were pretty minimal. Though it did make a big push in 2016, revamping the Zagat app with individually tailored review results.  The Infatuation, which uses an in-house team of reviewers to write up restaurants in major cities like New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles and London, is picking up the service for an undisclosed amount. The site clearly believes there\u2019s value left in the Zagat brand, even as the business of online reviews has changed significantly in the seven years sinceGoogle picked it up.  \u201cHow often does an iconic brand like Zagat become available?\u201d Infatuation co-founder Chris Stang rhetorically asked The Times in a phone interview.

Even setting aside the sweating philosophical toil of algorithmically sifting for some kind of universal truth, were Mountain View to truly live up to its own mission statement it would entail massive philanthropic investments in global Internet infrastructure coupled with Herculean language localization efforts.  After all \u2014 according to a Google search snippet \u2014 there are close to 7,000 languages globally\u2026  Which means every piece of Google-organized information should also really be translated ~7,000 times \u2014 to enable the sought for universal access. Or at least until its Pixel Buds actually live up to the universal Babel Fish claims.  We\u2019ll let Alphabet off also needing to invest in vast global educational programs to deliver universal worldwide literacy rates, being as they do also serve up video snippets and have engineered voice-based interfaces to disperse data orally, thereby expanding accessibility by not requiring users can read to use their products. (This makes snippets of increasing importance to Google\u2019s search biz, of course, if it\u2019s to successfully transition into the air, as voice interfaces that read you ten possible answers would get very tedious, very fast.)  Really, a more accurate Google mission statement would include the qualifier \u201csome of\u201d after the word \u201corganize\u201d. But hey, let\u2019s not knock Googlers for dreaming impossibly big.  And while the company might not yet be anywhere close to meaningfully achieving its moonshot mission, it has just announced some tweaks to those aforementioned search snippets \u2014 to try to avoid creating problematic information hierarchies.  As its search results unfortunately have been.  Thing is, when a search engine makes like an oracle of truth \u2014 by using algorithms to select and privilege a single answer per user generated question \u2014 then, well, bad things can happen.  Like your oracle informing the world that women are evil. Or claiming president Obama is planning a coup. Or making all sorts of other wild and spurious claims.  Here\u2019s a great thread to get you up to speed on some of the stupid stuff Google snippets have been suggestively passing off as \u2018universal truth\u2019 since they launched in January 2014\u2026  Google became the world\u2019s go-to source of information by ranking billions of links from millions of sources. Now it often presents a seemingly definitive answer above other search results \u2014 and many are contentious, improbable or laughably incorrect. https://t.co/ezepEiJAOT \u2014 Jack Nicas (@jacknicas) November 16, 2017  \u201cLast year, we took deserved criticism for featured snippets that said things like \u2018women are evil\u2019 or that former U.S. President Barack Obama was planning a coup,\u201d Google confesses now, saying it\u2019s \u201cworking hard\u201d to \u201csmooth out bumps\u201d with snippets as they \u201ccontinue to grow and evolve\u201d.  Bumps! We guess what they mean to say is algorithmically exacerbated bias and very visible instances of major and alarming product failure.  \u201cWe failed in these cases because we didn\u2019t weigh the authoritativeness of results strongly enough for such rare and fringe queries,\u201d Google adds.  For \u201crare and fringe queries\u201d you should also read: \u2018People deliberately trying to game the algorithm\u2019. Because that\u2019s what humans do (and frequently why algorithms fail and/or suck or both).  Sadly Google does not specify what proportion of search queries are rare and fringe, nor offer a more detailed breakdown of how it defines those concepts. Instead it claims:  The vast majority of featured snippets work well, as we can tell from usage stats and from what our search quality raters report to us, people paid to evaluate the quality of our results. A third-party test last year by Stone Temple found a 97.4 percent accuracy rate for featured snippets and related formats like Knowledge Graph information.  But even ~2.6% of featured snippets and related formats being inaccurate translates into a staggering amount of potential servings of fake news given the size of Google\u2019s search business. (A Google snippet tells me the company \u201cnow processes over 40,000 search queries every second on average\u2026 which translates to over 3.5 billion searches per day and 1.2 trillion searches per year worldwide\u201d.)  Google also flags the launch last April of updated search quality rater guidelines for IDing \u201clow-quality webpages\u201d \u2014 claiming this has helped it combat the problem of snippets serving wrong, stupid and/or biased answers.  \u201cThis work has helped our systems better identify when results are prone to low-quality content. If detected, we may opt not to show a featured snippet,\u201d it writes.  Though clearly, as Nicas\u2019 Twitter thread illustrates, Google still had plenty of work to do on the stupid snippet front as of last fall.  In his thread Nicas also noted that a striking facet of the problem for Google is the tendency for the answers it packages as \u2018truth snippets\u2019 to actually reflect how a question is framed \u2014 thereby \u201cconfirming user biases\u201d. Aka the filter bubble problem.  Google is now admitting as much, as it blogs about the reintroduced snippets, discussing how the answers it serves can end up contradicting each other depending on the query being asked.  \u201cThis happens because sometimes our systems favor content that\u2019s strongly aligned with what was asked,\u201d it writes. \u201cA page arguing that reptiles are good pets seems the best match for people who search about them being good. Similarly, a page arguing that reptiles are bad pets seems the best match for people who search about them being bad. We\u2019re exploring solutions to this challenge, including showing multiple responses.\u201d  So instead of a single universal truth, Google is flirting with multiple choice relativism as a possible engineering solution to make its suggestive oracle a better fit for messy (human) reality (and bias).  \u201cThere are often legitimate diverse perspectives offered by publishers, and we want to provide users visibility and access into those perspectives from multiple sources,\u201d writes Google, self-quoting its own engineer employee, Matthew Gray.  No shit Sherlock, as the kids used to say.  Gray leads the featured snippets team, and is thus presumably the techie tasked with finding a viable engineering workaround for humanity\u2019s myriad shades of grey. We feel for him, we really do.  Another snippets tweak Google says it\u2019s toying with \u2014 in this instance mostly to make itself look less dumb when its answers misfire in relation to the specific question being asked \u2014 is to make it clearer when it\u2019s showing only a near match for a query, not an exact match.  \u201cOur testing and experiments will guide what we ultimately do here,\u201d it writes cautiously. \u201cWe might not expand use of the format, if our testing finds people often inherently understand a near-match is being presented without the need for an explicit label.\u201d", "stock": "GOOGL", "label": -1, "date": "2018-01-31", "source": "techcrunch", "url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/01/31/google-tweaks-search-snippets-to-try-to-stop-serving-wrong-stupid-and-biased-answers/"}, {"article": "For the longest time now, Google Photos has used its machine learning magic to automatically create movies for you based on your recent trips or around special occasions.

With the regard to delays, Google Flights won\u2019t just be pulling in information from the airlines directly, however \u2013 it will take advantage of its understanding of historical data and its machine learning algorithms to predict delays that haven\u2019t yet been flagged by airlines themselves.  Explains Google, the combination of data and A.I. technologies means it can predict some delays in advance of any sort of official confirmation. Google says that it won\u2019t actually flag these in the app until it\u2019s at least 80 percent confident in the prediction, though. (Of course, you should still get to the airport on time, but at least you\u2019ll know what you\u2019re about to face once there.)  It will also provide reasons for the delays, like weather or an aircraft arriving late.  You can track the status of your flight by searching for your flight number or the airline and flight route, notes Google. The delay information will then appear in the search results.  The other new feature added today aims to help travelers make sense of what Basic Economy fares include and exclude with their ticket price.  These low-cost fares are often the only option for travelers on a budget, but they have a number of restrictions that can vary by airline.  Google Flights will now display the restrictions associated with these fares \u2013 like restrictions on using overhead space or the ability to select a seat, as well as the fare\u2019s additional baggage fees. It\u2019s initially doing so for American, Delta and United flights worldwide.  These changes come only a month after Google Flights added price tracking and deals to Google Flights as well as hotel search features for web searchers.  The additions seem especially targeted toward today\u2019s travel startups and businesses, like Hopper which had just added hotel search, and uses big data to analyze airline prices and other factors; or TripIt, a competitor of sorts to Google\u2019s own travel app Google Trips, which most recently introduced security checkpoint wait times.

But when American Express appealed, the Second Circuit reversed, relying on a new concept to create a special set of rules. The concept is that players in \u201ctwo-sided\u201d markets are unique because they serve different sets of customers in distinct but related markets, effectively facilitating transactions. American Express, for example, charges both merchants who accept its cards and consumers who use them. Using this concept, the Second Circuit held that the government would have to show that any price increases for merchants also harmed cardholders, or at least didn\u2019t benefit them. In effect, the court introduced a dramatically new rule, making it much more difficult to win important antitrust cases and to stop anticompetitive behavior.  The case is now at the Supreme Court. If affirmed, the Second Circuit decision would create de facto antitrust immunity for the most powerful companies in the economy. Since internet technologies have enabled the growth of platform companies that serve multiple groups of users, firms like Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Uber are set to be prime beneficiaries of the Second Circuit\u2019s warped analysis. Amazon, for example, could claim status as a two-sided platform because it connects buyers and sellers of goods; Google because it facilitates a market between advertisers and search users. (An industry trade group representing the tech platforms filed an amicus brief in support of American Express.) Indeed, the reason that the tech giants are lining up behind the Second Circuit\u2019s approach is that \u2014 if ratified \u2014 it would make it vastly more difficult to use antitrust laws against them.  The fact that the tech platforms could effectively be shielded from antitrust is troubling because, in several respects, these firms enjoy dominant market positions that makes antitrust scrutiny of their conduct especially important. By virtue of providing increasingly critical services, tech giants wield immense leverage over the sellers and buyers that rely on their platforms. This power is ripe for abuse. If the Supreme Court ratifies the Second Circuit\u2019s approach, platforms will be able to engage in anticompetitive activity with one set of users, so long as they can plausibly claim that harmful conduct enabled them to benefit another group. Say, for example, that Uber prohibited its drivers from also serving rivals like Lyft, suppressing driver income. Under the current approach, these exclusive agreements would likely violate antitrust law. But under the Second Circuit\u2019s analysis, the case would go nowhere unless plaintiffs could show that this practice also harmed riders.  This danger is compounded by the slipperiness of the concept underlying this analysis: the idea of a \u201ctwo-sided\u201d market. While reports paid for by the credit card industry introduce \u201ctwo-sided\u201d markets as a novel concept that requires special analysis, markets serving different groups of users have been around for centuries. They include, for example, grain futures exchanges (connecting farmers and buyers of farm products), banking (linking depositors and borrowers) and newspapers (serving advertisers and readers). For decades, courts have recognized that anticompetitive conduct imposed by a newspaper on readers, for example, is no less illegal if it can be shown to benefit advertisers.  Indeed, almost all markets can be understood as having two sides. Firms ranging from airlines to meatpackers could reasonably argue that they meet the definition of \u201ctwo-sided,\u201d thereby securing less stringent review.", "stock": "GOOGL", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-02", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/02/opinion/the-supreme-court-case-that-could-give-tech-giants-more-power.html"}, {"article": "Photo  SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Google did not break the law when it fired an engineer who wrote a memo critical of the company\u2019s diversity efforts, a lawyer for a federal labor agency said.

But for a product that's to be trusted to capture life's best moments, it doesn't fully deliver on that promise yet. Depending on your lifestyle (and patience level), it can pump out results, but it's usually way more 'miss' than 'hit'.  Google Clips is a camera, but that\u2019s underselling it a bit. It\u2019s a smart camera that utilizes an eerily good machine learning algorithm to identify, then auto-record scenes containing familiar faces, pets and more.  Similar to a normal point-and-shoot, you turn on Clips when you want to use it. There\u2019s a shutter button, too, which you can press to capture seven seconds of still photos encoded in a shareable video file. But to fully take advantage of Clips is to let it run on auto-pilot.  At its best, Clips catches the moments that you aren\u2019t prepared for, ones that you can\u2019t react quickly enough to capture. We all know the feeling of having just missed out on the perfect photo or video \u2013 this camera aims to put an end to that issue. Better yet, Google\u2019s camera succeeds where others don\u2019t by letting you step in front of its lens to participate in your life, even if it can feel a little orchestrated to those in the know of being recorded.  Update: Google has issued a small update to Clips that brings high-resolution manual stills and pinch-to-zoom functionality to the companion app.  Google isn\u2019t oblivious to the fact that most of us already use phones and DSLR cameras to take photos and videos. While those options excel at capturing pinpoint moments in time, Clips is more of a broad strokes approach by comparison, and is said to improve over time thanks to machine learning.  Putting its smarts aside, this camera will feel trivial for some from a usability perspective. Sure, you can carry it around and capture things that way, though why not just use a phone, which likely houses a more capable lens? Also, I\u2019ve learned that it\u2019s a really big ask to make sure that my life unfolds within the camera\u2019s 130-degree field of view. I often found that, coincidentally, more interesting stuff was always happening off-screen. It takes more effort than I expected to make Clips feel useful.  At $249, Clips isn\u2019t the most affordable way of catching the moments that fall between the gaps of your DSLR or phone use. And unfortunately, throughout the review process, it showed that it's not so great in its current form. I can't say that it captured anything that really showed off its unique ability to know, better than I do, when\u2019s best to start capturing.  For now, you can safely stick with your trusty camera. But we'll keep watching Clips and will make a note should it improve.  Design  Like other Google products, like Google Home, Google Daydream, and Google Pixel 2, Clips is minimalistic, yet quite expressive in its design. While it\u2019s hard to confuse it as anything but a camera, it certainly looks unique compared to other quick-capture cameras like the Samsung Gear 360, appearing more like a large Tile tracker keyring than something that takes footage.  On its front, Clips\u2019 lens takes up most of the real estate. It\u2019s a clever, intuitive decision to make twisting it work as its power switch, and thanks to the colored indicator, it\u2019s easy to tell when it\u2019s off or on. Not just that, but there are a series of lights that illuminate when powered on to clue you into what the camera\u2019s doing, as well as notify the general public that, \u201chey, you might be on camera right now\u201d.  Snug beneath the lens is the shutter button, which looks a lot like a fingerprint sensor. Clips is skilled at shooting footage automatically based on what it finds interesting, as instructed by its machine learning algorithm. But Google told us that the main reason behind the button is simply because there are some moments when you\u2019ll have better judgment than Clips will.  Moving to the back, Google\u2019s mini camera is clad in a creamy teal shell that feels built to last. But if don\u2019t want to subject it to scratches or scuffs, you can pop it in the included silicon shell. It\u2019s actually how this camera gets its \u201cClips\u201d moniker \u2013 you can clip it anywhere it will fit. I\u2019ve found that, despite its flexibility, the clip wasn\u2019t able to fit onto much in my apartment. Your mileage will vary, of course. But one thing that the clip is useful for in any situation is as a more stable stand. Clips can stand by itself, but it isn\u2019t so wobbly with the case.  There\u2019s a USB-C charging port on the bottom, and next to it, a reset button puts Clips back to factory default settings.", "stock": "GOOGL", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-27", "source": "techradar", "url": "https://www.techradar.com/reviews/google-clips"}, {"article": "Google announced a new feature today that will help you out when you're deciding what movie to go see.

Two former Google workers allege as much in a class-action lawsuit they filed against the company last week. While they may have difficulty prevailing in court, they make a strong case that Google aggressively promotes a political agenda and is far from a neutral broker of information.  Former Google engineers James Damore and David Gudeman claim they were fired for failing to conform to the company\u2019s progressive culture. Last summer Mr. Damore published what was initially an internal cri de coeur against Google\u2019s \u201cideological echo chamber\u201d that criticized its intolerance for alternative views and suggested biology may make men better suited, on average, for tech jobs. Many Google employees demanded Mr. Damore\u2019s termination and a purge of those who shared his views. Senior managers allegedly told Mr. Damore that he was fired for \u201cperpetuating gender stereotypes.\u201d  Mr. Gudeman was fired after he questioned a Muslim co-worker who claimed he was being targeted by the federal government because of his religion. According to the lawsuit, Google claimed Mr. Gudeman had accused the colleague of terrorism.  Messrs. Damore and Gudeman claim to be victims of sex, race and political discrimination. Discrimination in employment on the basis of race, sex, national origin and religion are prohibited by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. But federal law doesn\u2019t forbid employers to discriminate based on their political or cultural views. So the plaintiffs are suing under California labor law, which prohibits employers from \u201cforbidding or preventing employees from engaging or participating in politics.\u201d Employers also cannot discharge or threaten to terminate employees to coerce them into political action.  To win certification as a class action, the plaintiffs must demonstrate that numerous Google employees suffered a common injury. To win their case, they\u2019ll have to show that Google itself adopted or enforced a policy that forbade employees from engaging in politics and led to systematic discrimination against white, conservative men\u2014or alternatively that Google fired Messrs. Damore and Gudeman to force employees to adopt progressive views.  Google\u2019s likely defense will be that it pledges to \u201ccreate a respectful culture that is free of harassment, intimidation, or unlawful discrimination of any kind,\u201d and that the firing of Messrs. Damore and Gudeman was in furtherance of this policy. But the plaintiffs make a good case that Google has selectively and unfairly enforced its policy, and in doing so has promoted a hostile workplace.  Mr. Damore alleges that after he and some co-workers complained about Google\u2019s ideological conformity and diversity training\u2014\u201cbias busting\u201d seminars on \u201cwhite male privilege\u201d and the like\u2014they were shunned, denounced and punished. One manager sent out a mass email describing Mr. Damore\u2019s memo as \u201crepulsive and intellectually dishonest\u201d and allegedly \u201cpromoted posts that advocated for physical violence\u201d against him. A co-worker emailed Mr. Damore: \u201cYou\u2019re a misogynist and a terrible person. I will keep hounding you until one of us is fired. [Expletive] you.\u201d Mr. Damore says he forwarded the email to the human-resources department and was told to work from home. He was fired soon after. Another manager allegedly threatened to ask Google\u2019s employee-relations department to sift through old posts on Google\u2019s \u201cconservatives@\u201d mailing list for code-of-conduct violations.  The plaintiffs also include nearly 100 pages of employee postings on Google\u2019s chat system that disparage conservatives as well as white men. Several employees circulated a meme asserting that \u201c \u2018America First\u2019 is a slogan for American Nazis\u201d and \u201cyou should absolutely punch Nazis.\u201d  Others posted: \u201cIf you want to increase diversity at Google, fire all the bigoted white men\u201d and \u201cby being a white male you are in a privileged class that is actively harmful to others.\u201d One described Mr. Damore and his supporters as \u201ca cancer within our culture.\u201d Many demonstrated an animus toward Christianity\u2014for instance: \u201cPeople in Indiana are bigots, but they don\u2019t call it bigotry. What do they call it? Religious freedom.\u201d  Managers allegedly maintained \u201cblacklists\u201d of conservatives who were blocked from working on their teams, which thwarted their advancement. One manager who blacklisted an intern because he refused to alter his political views allegedly wrote to a fellow manager: \u201cI don\u2019t think he was aware that there were real consequences for his actions. That might have given him the right motivation to change his beliefs or at least to keep his mouth shut.\u201d  According to the lawsuit, Google \u201crelies on crowdsourced harassment and \u2018pecking\u2019 to enforce social norms (including politics) that it feels it cannot write directly into its policies.\u201d It\u2019s as if the company were using machine learning to program its employees\u2019 politics.  Even if Google prevails in the lawsuit, it may consider whether this is any way to run a business. Ideological uniformity can undermine the ability to connect with disparate consumers and generate innovative ideas. That\u2019s especially true for a company like Google, whose founding mission was to make information \u201cuniversally accessibly and useful.\u201d People with divergent political views may have different ideas about what information is useful.  Silencing alternative views and sheltering employees from uncomfortable ideas, as many colleges do, will surely undermine Google\u2019s own ability to attract creative thinkers. Employee intolerance might have also contributed to its subsidiary YouTube\u2019s censorship in 2016 of conservative PragerU videos. And the Daily Caller reported last week that the search engine was providing selective and inaccurate \u201cfact checks\u201d for conservative, but not liberal, sites.  Google\u2019s Orwellian conceptions of inclusivity and diversity also ought to raise questions about its commitment to an \u201copen internet.\u201d How exactly does it define open?

Get past the absurdity of his framing his grievance in terms of identity politics\u2014he\u2019s a victim of Google\u2019s failure to honor \u201cviewpoint diversity.\u201d Apparently under California law this is a legitimate claim.  Last year\u2019s firing episode at first seemed a case of Google clumsily suppressing dissent over race and gender policies adopted after the company\u2019s workforce was found to be overwhelmingly white and male. Now it seems like something else.  If the postings and emails cited in Mr. Damore\u2019s lawsuit are a reliable indication, founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page have lost control of the culture. Google\u2019s leaders may even be a little afraid of their employees.  Mr. Damore\u2019s firing last year by CEO Sundar Pichai certainly rang of panic at the time. Google explicitly invites freewheeling discussion and provides internal forums for it. Mr. Damore did not, in his famous memo, object to Google\u2019s diversity goals. His ruminations on biology may be jejune, but unwelcome facts are still facts. Witness the work of David Lubinski at Vanderbilt, which goes a long way toward explaining the recruiting frustrations of many a tech and engineering-based company. Prof. Lubinski and colleagues find that women who are gifted in math and science tend to be broadly gifted, and consequently have lots of opportunities in a wide range of fields, whereas men with math talents tend to be narrowly gifted, and all end up in math-science-engineering fields.  Not that Mr. Damore\u2019s lawsuit, in which he is joined by another recently fired male engineer, turns on the validity of his Darwinian musings. In the postings and emails he quotes, colleagues spew hate at Mr. Damore, apparently without consequence.  We see them giving each other employee-awarded \u201cpeer bonuses,\u201d supported by Google\u2019s \u201cRecognition Team,\u201d for denouncing him. We see Google employees explicitly reject talking to, listening to or working with colleagues whose politics they don\u2019t share.  We see them proposing blacklists. One paints as incapable of coming up with anything \u201ccreative or innovative\u201d any meeting consisting of \u201c40-something white men,\u201d and Google HR approves the sentiment. An employee asks if \u201cmen\u201d were changed to \u201cwomen,\u201d would the post still be approved? No response.  Another posting calls on Googlers to decline to participate in industry panels alongside \u201ccheesy white males.\u201d  One Googler who says he refuses to \u201ctolerate\u201d broad categories of people (e.g., Trump voters) might seem regrettable, especially after it turns out he\u2019s German and lives in Switzerland. When it becomes a competition, a cultural disease is at work. Incipient here is a world that people in Google\u2019s home state are already familiar with. It\u2019s the world of California\u2019s maximum-security prison system, where inmates survive only by kneeling to one identity-based gang or another.  If there is a lesson here for other companies\u2014and don\u2019t take this the wrong way\u2014it\u2019s the value, broadly, of \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell.\u201d  To work together on software, people don\u2019t need a company-supplied forum to discuss their politics, their sexual interests, their cultural antipathies. Offering it seems pointlessly divisive.  Perhaps the most symbolically disturbed posting is one demanding that control of Google be wrested from the \u201chorde of racist and sexist people we\u2019ve already hired.\u201d  To be white and male is not to be sexist and racist. The statement \u201cI don\u2019t want to be denied an opportunity because of my gender and race\u201d is as valid for a white male as it is for a black, gay, female or furry. (Yes, Google\u2019s internal discussion board includes consideration of the \u201cfurry\u201d lifestyle, which involves dressing up in animal costumes.)  Some predict Google will quickly settle to avoid discovery of more emails and postings, including from top management. What seems worse, from a public-relations perspective, is a culture inveterately hostile to the liberal principle \u201cI may disagree with what you say but defend your right to say it.\u201d This can\u2019t be good in a business whose mission is to organize the world\u2019s information.  Messrs. Brin, Page and Pichai likely feel a tad helpless. The U.S. legal system imposes a need to be race-aware, gender-aware, etc.\u2014to require quotas in all but name, since quotas are illegal. Google simultaneously faces lawsuits and regulatory investigations directed at its alleged shortchanging of women on pay and promotions.  Its internal mood may also partly be a victim of self-esteem run amok. It\u2019s a wonder many Googlers don\u2019t worship Donald Trump \u2014he also can\u2019t tolerate to be disagreed with. A good, old-fashioned Presbyterian horror of self-righteousness, once a feature of American life, is nowhere to be seen.  Part of growing up is learning to live with your emotions; today\u2019s shortcut is to believe whatever your feelings are, they\u2019re justified.

They do\u2014more than ever. The problem is that the money generated by news audiences flows mostly to Google and Facebook , not to the reporters and publishers who produce excellent journalism.  The Duopoly now captures 83% of all digital ad revenue growth and 73% of U.S. digital advertising, according to a CNBC report. As a result, newspapers\u2019 online audience growth does not produce revenue to match. According to data from Pew, newspaper advertising revenue fell from $22 billion in 2014 to $18 billion in 2016 even as web traffic for the top 50 U.S. newspapers increased 42%.  Local news is most at risk. As print circulation declines, community news publishers have the hardest time adapting to the ever-changing demands of Facebook and Google algorithms. We think of \u201cfake news\u201d as a national phenomenon, but in the absence of a workable news business model, wild rumors and conspiracy theories could become more influential at the local level, too.  Tech savvy, digital-only publishers are also struggling. BuzzFeed CEO Jonah Peretti said in December that Google and Facebook are \u201cpaying content creators far too little for the value they deliver to users,\u201d and that \u201cthis puts high-quality creators at a financial disadvantage, and favors publishers of cheap media.\u201d  A user launches the Facebook app on his phone. Photo: Elise Amendola/Associated Press  Google and Facebook have become the primary and de facto regulators of the news business, and governments around the world are starting to recognize the danger. British Prime Minister Theresa May announced earlier this month that her government would review the economics of internet news consumption. Regulators in Germany, Israel and South Korea are investigating how Google\u2019s business practices have disrupted the media market and harmed publishers and consumers. U.S. regulators, on the other hand, have rarely looked into Google or Facebook\u2014and never at their influence in the news marketplace.  Some voices on the left and right are calling for Google and Facebook to be regulated as utilities. But there is an easier solution: exempt news publishers from certain aspects of antitrust regulation.  U.S. antitrust laws, designed to promote fair competition and prevent consolidation, actually make it harder for traditional news outlets to compete with Silicon Valley giants. Under current law, for instance, news publishers cannot get together and agree to withhold their product unless they receive a return on their investment. Let\u2019s start by changing that simple inequity. News publishers should be able to use their collective leverage in negotiations with big tech.  Rep. David Cicilline, top Democrat on the House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee, is expected to introduce a bill to do that next week. The Journalism Competition and Preservation Act of 2018 is a low-regulation, pro-market way to unleash the news industry\u2019s negotiating power. If antitrust enforcers can\u2019t protect society from the outsize influence of modern-day trusts, the least the government can do is get out of the way and let publishers protect themselves and their readers.

They entered a long-term patent cross-licensing agreement for a broad range of products and technologies, the two companies said Friday, adding they were open to more cooperation in the future.  \u201cBy working together on agreements such as this, tech companies can focus on building better products and services for their users,\u201d Mike Lee, Google\u2019s head of patents, said in a statement.

Cross-licensing deals allow companies to license each other\u2019s technology for use in different markets, said Lester Ross, an attorney at WilmerHale in Beijing. Mr. Ross said that cross-licensing deals can restrain competition, but that they also create market efficiencies\u2014for example, reducing the cost of having to file for patents in multiple countries.  Companies such as Samsung Electronics Co. and Apple Inc. have signed such agreements in the past to prevent infringing each other\u2019s technology and regional patents and therefore avoiding expensive lawsuits.  The arrangement is the latest in a string of moves by Google to expand its reach into mainland China, after it pulled out its main search business in 2010 due to concerns about hacking and censorship. Several weeks ago, the Mountain View, Calif.-based company opened an artificial-intelligence lab in Beijing, and this week said it is opening a new Chinese office\u2014in Shenzhen, the city near Hong Kong, where Tencent is based.  Google already operates offices in Beijing and Shanghai, employing about 600 staff. Although Google\u2019s search engine is blocked in China, the offices are used mostly for its ad sales staff and engineers working on its global products. Google will use the new base in Shenzhen in part to tap into the region\u2019s electronics hardware supply chain, according to an email sent to its Chinese employees.  Tencent is China\u2019s largest tech company by market capitalization, and it makes most of its money from videogames. Its WeChat social network app is dominant in China, but has scant reach beyond.

Supporters of Hun Sen have built a strong presence on Facebook.  Sam Rainsy wants information on allegations of \u201cfalse likes\u201d on Hun Sen\u2019s Facebook account, accusations that the platform had been used to make death threats and the use of state money for advertisements, his legal team said in a statement on Wednesday.  Government spokesman Phay Siphan said the lawsuit was \u201cnot useful\u201d.  The case highlights the growing global nature of the challenge to Facebook Inc over its role in political debate after accusations that social media was used for meddling in votes in Britain, the United States and elsewhere.  Facebook has become an ever more important platform for political news in Cambodia as some media outlets critical of Hun Sen have been forced to shut.  Hun Sen, 65, has been criticized by Western countries over a ban on the main opposition party and the arrest of its leader less than a year away from a general election on July 29.

An internal Facebook white paper, published days after the election, shows the company\u2019s data scientists agree.  \u201cBoth campaigns spent heavily on Facebook between June and November of 2016,\u201d the author of the internal paper writes, citing revenue of $44 million for Trump and $28 million for Clinton in that period. \u201cBut Trump\u2019s FB campaigns were more complex than Clinton\u2019s and better leveraged Facebook\u2019s ability to optimize for outcomes.\u201d  The paper, obtained by Bloomberg and discussed here for the first time, describes in granular detail the difference between Trump\u2019s campaign, which was focused on finding new donors, and Clinton\u2019s campaign, which concentrated on ensuring Clinton had broad appeal. The data scientist says 84 percent of Trump\u2019s budget asked people on Facebook to take an action, like donating, compared with 56 percent of Clinton\u2019s.  Facebook didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.  Trump ran 5.9 million different versions of ads during the presidential campaign and rapidly tested them to spread those that generated the most Facebook engagement, according to the paper. Clinton ran 66,000 different kinds of ads in the same period.  As is typical at Facebook, employees had access to the white paper, according to a person familiar with the matter. Employees routinely publish papers so colleagues can dig into issues facing the company and learn how certain products work.  A former Facebook employee cited the information from the white paper in a memo to Representative Adam Schiff\u2019s office in early March, saying it could help Congress ask the right questions about whether the campaign coordinated with Russia. For example, according to the paper, more than a quarter of Trump\u2019s ad spending was tied to third-party data files on voters, and leveraged a Facebook tool that helped the campaign show ads to people who looked similar to the names on file. Clinton\u2019s ads aimed for broader audiences, with only 4 percent of her Facebook spend on the lookalike tool.  \u201cDid Russian operatives give the Trump campaign a list of names to include or exclude from advertising that was running on Facebook?\u201d the former employee asked in the memo.  Republicans shut down the House of Representatives\u2019 investigation into Russia and Trump days later, \u201cleaving questions unanswered, leads unexplored, countless witnesses uncalled, subpoenas unissued,\u201d Schiff, a California Democrat, wrote on Twitter. A Schiff spokesman declined to comment for this story.  But Congress is still focusing on the use of third-party information on Facebook for another reason: the company\u2019s ensuing crisis over data on 50 million users obtained by Cambridge Analytica, a political advertising firm that helped Trump\u2019s campaign. Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg is set to make his first congressional testimony on the issue in a matter of days.  One key question Zuckerberg is likely to face, raised in the former employee\u2019s memo to Schiff: What lists of Facebook users did Trump\u2019s campaign upload for advertising purposes?  Facebook is still working to unearth other information that congressional investigators have requested. The company is continuing to comb through its site to identify content posted by the Internet Research Agency, a Russian organization that used Facebook to manipulate public discourse in America ahead of the election. On Tuesday, the company took down more than 270 accounts and pages operated by the IRA that were used to spread messages to people in Russia and neighboring countries.  \u201cThis is the next step towards removing them from Facebook entirely,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote Tuesday on his Facebook page. \u201cOrganizations like the IRA are sophisticated adversaries who are constantly evolving, but we\u2019ll keep improving our techniques to stay ahead -- especially when it comes to protecting the integrity of elections.\u201d", "stock": "FB", "label": 1, "date": "2018-04-03", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-03/trump-s-campaign-said-it-was-better-at-facebook-facebook-agrees"}, {"article": "Facebook Inc. is banning ads on its social network that promote cryptocurrencies, initial coin offerings and binary options, saying they\u2019re \u201cfrequently associated with misleading or deceptive promotional practices.\u201d  The policy will be \u201cintentionally broad\u201d while Facebook works to understand which ads are deceptive or misleading, from companies \u201cnot currently operating in good faith,\u201d the company said Tuesday in a blog post.

Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google is fighting similar claims in federal court in Chicago.  U.S. District Judge James Donato\u2019s decision to let the class-action case proceed means that Facebook is still potentially on the hook for fines under a unique Illinois law of $1,000 to $5,000 each time a person\u2019s image is used without permission.

Suits over selling the data to advertisers have often failed.  In 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court set a \u201cconcrete injury\u201d standard for privacy suits in a case involving search-engine operator Spokeo Inc., a ruling that both sides in the Facebook suit attempted to use to their advantage.  The Illinois residents who sued under the Biometric Information Privacy Act said the 2008 state law gives them a \u201cproperty interest\u201d in the algorithms that constitute their digital identities -- in other words, gives them grounds to accuse Facebook of real harm.  Facebook, which got the case moved to San Francisco from Illinois, argued the users hadn\u2019t suffered a concrete injury such as physical harm, loss of money or property; or a denial of their right to free speech or religion.  Donato concluded that the alleged violation of the user-consent requirement in the Illinois law goes to \u201cthe very privacy rights the Illinois legislature sought to protect.\u201d  \u201cThis injury is worlds away from the trivial harm of a mishandled zip code or credit card receipt,\u201d he wrote.

In 2018, we're focused on making sure Facebook isn't just fun to use, but also good for people's well-being and for society.

Still, Facebook was adding total monthly users, though mostly from an older cohort.  Snap is poised to add more users this year than ever given its new app redesign.  Watch Snap's stock trade in real time here.    Snap shares were gaining ground after a report found that Facebook was losing younger users at a faster clip to Snapchat than previously expected.  Snap's stock was up 2.23% on Monday morning at $19.22 a share.  \"While the social media platform was able to count on Instagram to retain that younger audience in the past, Snapchat may now be siphoning away more users,\" according to the eMarketer study.  Social media companies have closely monitored millennials, particularly teenagers, because they represent a large base of sustainable growth.  Yet Facebook is still popular among older age groups, adding monthly users overall. The New York-based marketing firm eMarketer believes Facebook will add around 1% more users in 2018, compared to the previous year.  However, the study found that Facebook will lose 9.3% of US Facebook users between ages 11 and younger. Meanwhile, the number of Facebook users ages 12 to 17 will decline by 5.6% and users aged 18 to 24 will fall by 5.8% in 2018. Facebook would lose up to 2 million users under the age of 24 this year, according to the eMarketer study.  Facebook's stock was up 0.82% at $177.55 per share ahead of Monday's opening bell.  \u201cSnapchat could eventually experience more growth in older age groups, since it\u2019s redesigning its platform to be easier to use,\u201d eMarketer principal analyst Debra Aho Williamson stated in a release. \u201cThe question will be whether younger users will still find Snapchat cool if more of their parents and grandparents are on it. That\u2019s the predicament Facebook is in.\u201d  Snapchat may see its user base grow by 9.3% to 86.5 million this year, eMarketer added.  Shares of Snap have been trading higher after the company reported blockbuster fourth-quarter earnings last week. Snap's stock was up 25.79% for the year.

Right now, the contributor of the tips doesn\u2019t get any special call-out or privileges, though Facebook tells me it\u2019s considering different options for creators and gamers. For instance, it could have a special emoji Reaction float across the stream as a way to thank the fan who gave money.  The amount Facebook will keep from these tips that it calls \u201cfan support\u201d isn\u2019t clear yet, but the company tells me that it\u2019s safe to assume there will be a revenue share. Apparently it\u2019s too early to lock any percentage in, though Facebook has taken a 30 percent cut from game developers in the past, and currently takes a 45 percent share of ad revenue from people who place ad breaks in the videos, so it could be in that ballpark.

Goals of the program include helping gamers of all fame levels grow meaningful and engaged communities of followers across Facebook, Instagram and Oculus, plus providing monetization tools.  Gamers who want to join the program and gain access to tipping on their streams can sign up to apply here. There\u2019s also a big site full of best-practices for gamers who want to grow their audience amidst Facebook\u2019s ever-changing News Feed algorithm.  Facebook hopes to pull game streamers away from YouTube and Twitch where they have ad revenue, tipping and subscription options to monetize. For reference, YouTube takes a 30 percent rake from its Super Chat tipping and Sponsorships subscription payments options, while Twitch also takes 30 percent from its Cheering tipping option.  The push aligns with Facebook\u2019s recent overhaul of its News Feed with a focus on well-being and active interaction over passive media consumption. Game streams often see viewers chiming in about what they want the creator to do next while debating tactics and joking around with fellow viewers. That gives people a better sense of connection than just watching random eye-catching throwaway videos in the feed. It\u2019s the same reason Facebook just inked exclusive deals to stream big esports tournaments, like CS:GO.  If Facebook can lure creators with its 2 billion-plus user audience and virality, plus its new payment system, it could develop a wide array of video content for video game enthusiasts to watch.

Facebook now has 1.4 billion daily users, up 2.18% compared to growing 3.8% to 1.37 billion users in Q3. That\u2019s a sizeable slow down, and the lowest quarter-over-quarter percentage daily user growth ever reported by the company.  That could be because CEO Mark Zuckerberg says Facebook made changes including showing fewer viral videos \u201cthat reduced time spent on Facebook by roughly 50 million hours every day.\u201d That equates to 2.14 minutes per daily user per day, or 5% of total time spent on Facebook. The viral video changes triggered Facebook\u2019s first-ever decline in daily active users in the US & Canada region, which saw a 700,000 user decline.  Facebook reached $12.97 billion in revenue with $2.21 adjusted GAAP earnings per share if you don\u2019t count a massive tax it had to pay on overseas cash that translated into a $0.77 reduction in EPS. Without that tax, it beat Wall Street\u2019s estimates of $12.55 billion in revenue and $1.95 EPS, but with it reported $1.44 EPS.  Facebook\u2019s monthly user count is now at 2.13 billion, up 3.39% from 2.06 billion in Q3 compared to 3.19% growth that quarter, so the monthly user growth sped up even as daily user growth slowed. Yet Facebook\u2019s stickiness, or the percentage of monthly users that come back daily, held strong at 66% where it\u2019s been since 2015. That shows people are still avidly returning to the site even if they spend less time there.  Average revenue per user climbed to $6.18, up 27% from a year ago. Average revenue was up 47% year-over-year, even though Facebook has been warning investors that it\u2019s running out of space in the News Feed to put ads. Facebook raked in a record $4.26 billion in profit, down from $4.7 billion the previous quarter due to that big tax. Facebook\u2019s share price was down at first down a steep 4% in after-hours trading, but now is up over 3%.  [Updates from the earnings call: Facebook announced that WhatsApp now has 1.5 billion monthly users, up from 1.3 billion in July. It announced a 700,000 daily user decline in the US & Canada due to reducing viral video visibility. Zuckerberg said he\u2019s directed his company to priortize not the most meaningful content, but the content that drives the most meaningful interaction. Facebook\u2019s research suggests total Story posting across apps will overtake feed posting.]  Overall, the results show how divorced Facebook\u2019s user behavior is from the day-to-day news coverage blasting it for allowing Russian interference in US elections and for making us unhealthy zombie browsers. ComScore and Nielsen claim time spent on Facebook per U.S. user is declining, and that showed up in the daily user count growth. And Facebook purposefully made changes leading to its first ever decline of daily users in the US. But Facebook seems to be making up for that in international monthly user growth and squeezing more dollars out of each ad.  With the Snapchat threat largely neutralized via Instagram, Facebook\u2019s biggest enemy is itself.

The filing seeks records of those transactions from Facebook, and it urges the company to assess whether Mr. Hun Sen and his allies have been violating the platform\u2019s terms of use.  Photo  Genevieve Grdina, a spokeswoman for Facebook, declined to comment directly on the petition, but she said that anyone with a public Facebook page could purchase targeted ads to reach particular audiences, and that Facebook made every possible effort to identify and eliminate click farms and fake pages.  Mr. Hun Sen, who has been in power for 33 years, has overseen an extensive crackdown on dissent and opposition as national elections scheduled for July have approached. The country\u2019s main opposition party has been dissolved, its leaders \u2014 including Mr. Sam Rainsy, who lives abroad \u2014 have been driven into exile or jailed, and independent news media outlets have been shut down.  Mr. Hun Sen nearly lost Cambodia\u2019s last national elections, in 2013, to the party led by Mr. Sam Rainsy, which used Facebook to appeal to young people and to skirt government restrictions on his access to traditional media. The opposition recruited a team to report and broadcast news shows entirely on Facebook, and used young social media stars to encourage attendance at antigovernment protests. (The opposition and its supporters also used the site to spread false rumors, as well as racist claims about Vietnamese living in Cambodia.)  Mr. Hun Sen seemed to learn his lesson. The premier and his family assembled a team to disseminate pro-government propaganda and pour money into promoting their own pages on Facebook, which is one of the country\u2019s most popular sources of information. Government ministries, all of which are run by Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s party, were ordered to form \u201cFacebook working groups,\u201d and officials were told to start their own personal pages to interact with the public.  However his \u201clikes\u201d were generated, Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s Facebook page now has more of them than any other in Cambodia. On it, he intersperses policy dictates and slick propaganda videos with slices of everyday life: photographs of him in an undershirt on the beach, in bed with his wife, and hugging garment factory workers. In speeches posted to his page, he rails against his political opponents and threatens that war will ensue if he ever loses power, while also offering folksy musings and updates on his health.  Duong Dara, who manages Mr. Hun Sen\u2019s Facebook presence, said Mr. Sam Rainsy\u2019s petition revealed a misunderstanding of the nature of advertising.

One study, published by researchers at the University of Oregon in 2016, found that the use of image-based platforms like Instagram and Snapchat was associated with lower levels of loneliness among users, and higher levels of happiness and satisfaction, while text-based platforms had no correlation with improved mental health.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  A heavily visual platform also makes a relatively poor conduit for breaking news and in-the-moment commentary, which might explain why Instagram often feels less exhausting than other social networks.

Lesson No. 2: Rethink the share button.  One of Instagram\u2019s most underrated virtues is that it has imposed structural limits on virality \u2014 the ability of a given post to spread beyond its intended audience. Unlike Twitter and Facebook, on Instagram there is no native sharing function, meaning that the reach of most Instagram posts is capped at the number of people who follow the user\u2019s account. (There are ways to \u201cregram\u201d someone else\u2019s photo using a third-party app, but they\u2019re clunky, and relatively few people use them.

View all New York Times newsletters.  A native share button has been tremendously useful for Facebook\u2019s and Twitter\u2019s growth. It has also allowed upstart media organizations like BuzzFeed and Upworthy to build enormous audiences by specializing in highly shareable stories. But ease of sharing has also allowed the loudest and most emotional voices to be rewarded with clicks \u2014 and attention. It\u2019s this incentive structure that has allowed partisans and profiteers to hijack Facebook\u2019s algorithms and spread divisive messages and false news to millions of people.  The easy virality of Facebook also seems to have made individual users more hesitant about opening up. That makes sense \u2014 it\u2019s easier to share a selfie if you know it won\u2019t accidentally find its way into the feeds of a million strangers.  Lesson No. 3: Ban links.  Instagram\u2019s greatest structural advantage, though, may be a result of its decision to go mostly link-free. Links in Instagram captions and comments aren\u2019t clickable, and while some users have found workarounds, the vast majority of Instagram posts aren\u2019t meant to send users to outside websites. (The exceptions are ads, which can contain clickable links and are, not coincidentally, the most troubled part of Instagram\u2019s platform.)  Photo  The walled-garden nature of Instagram has frustrated publishers, who want to send followers out to their websites, where the publishers can earn advertising money and \u201ccontrol the reader experience.\u201d (It\u2019s really just about the money.) But Instagram has wisely refused to give in, perhaps realizing that allowing links might turn the platform into a screeching bazaar, with publishers and pages all doing circus acts for clicks.  Removing links from Facebook would wreak havoc on the digital media industry, which has built an economic model around referral traffic from Facebook. It would also risk alienating some users, who enjoy promoting and discussing stories from other parts of the internet. But it would also solve some of the platform\u2019s most vexing challenges. And ultimately, it would be better for the world.  After all, malicious actors don\u2019t post fabricated news, wildly exaggerated headlines or partisan outrage-bait on Facebook only for fun. They do it, in many cases, because it\u2019s profitable. Take away bad actors\u2019 incentives and they\u2019ll go elsewhere.  Banning most links doesn\u2019t seem to have hurt Instagram as a business. It had more than 800 million monthly active users as of September, and it gained a million new advertisers last year. Facebook doesn\u2019t break out Instagram\u2019s revenue, but some analysts expect the app could one day generate as much as $10 billion in annual revenue. That\u2019s still nowhere near Facebook, which earned $10 billion in revenue last quarter alone, but it\u2019s a meaningful number, and it shows that insularity isn\u2019t always a bad thing.

Instagram is far from a perfect social network, and copying it wouldn\u2019t fix all of Facebook\u2019s problems overnight.

Now, Facebook is looking to get even more mixed in with a new Software Development Kit (SDK) that puts a strong emphasis on game streaming, especially on the popular front of PC gaming. And, this isn't Facebook's first shot at game streaming, either.  For developers, the new SDK is positioned as a way to draw in more community engagement and get gamers sharing. It will also offer them analytics on gamer activity.  But, livestreaming is clearly positioned front and center. With solo streamers setting records on Twitch, it's a market plenty want to get a bite of. Twitch, YouTube and Mixer are all competing for the same pie. Now, Facebook is working on getting itself a good slice.  PC Game developers can also now reward viewers  Only last January, Facebook landed an exclusive eSports streaming deal with the ESL for Dota 2 and Counter Strike: Global Offensive competitions. The new SDK has the possibility of bringing even more livestreams to Facebook.  A particular advantage the SDK has is that it doesn't require any extra special software or hardware to handle the streams, lowering the barrier of entry for gamers to put their streams in front of viewers. It will also enable a clipping feature similar to the social sharing seen on Sony and Microsoft consoles.  While much hinges on how many developers make use of the new SDK, it's likely to give Facebook a little more firepower against its stiff competition. The new SDK will be available for developers soon, and applies to mobile, PC and console gaming.

Last week, in a move widely seen as a possible back door into China for the Silicon Valley company, Facebook joined with Beijing-based smartphone company Xiaomi Corp. to launch a new virtual-reality headset called Mi VR Standalone, modeled after Facebook\u2019s Oculus Go.  Ms. Moser, a U.S. citizen born in China, was hired to help build face-to-face relations with government officials. Before joining Facebook, Ms. Moser spent more than a decade at Intel Corp. in China, where former colleagues said she helped Intel build a $2.5 billion factory.  In a 2011 essay, she called arranging meetings with Chinese officials a \u201clong, trivial and pressing\u201d task. She had some successes at Facebook, joining Mr. Zuckerberg for a meeting with Lu Wei, then China\u2019s top internet regulator, at Facebook headquarters in late 2014.  She also accompanied Mr. Zuckerberg in March 2016 to Beijing meetings with Mr. Lu and the Communist Party\u2019s ideology chief Liu Yunshan.

Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images  Members of Congress took turns lashing Mark Zuckerberg this week for Facebook \u2019s myriad screw-ups. The CEO showed contrition, but his apologia has raised important questions about the government\u2019s failures.  Democrats who were once enthralled with Silicon Valley fell out of love with Facebook following reports that Russian trolls used its platform to promulgate fake news and ads to support Donald Trump in 2016. Then came news that a political firm linked to the Trump campaign may have misappropriated data on 270,000 users and their 87 million friends collected by a third-party app.  Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s defense? Facebook was too \u201ctrusting.\u201d After the Guardian newspaper reported in 2015 that a Cambridge University researcher had shared data from his personality-quiz app with the political firm Cambridge Analytica , Facebook asked Cambridge Analytica to delete the data. Cambridge Analytica said it had, and Facebook accepted its word.  The incident demonstrated that Facebook\u2019s privacy protections were flimsier than it claimed. In 2011 Facebook settled charges with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) over mishandling user data, and Facebook agreed to establish stronger privacy protections and obtain periodic third-party audits. But Facebook has now disclosed that tens of thousands of apps may have obtained data on users and their friends beyond what they needed to operate.  This seems to violate the FTC\u2019s consent decree, as Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal noted. Mr. Zuckerberg waffled in reply that \u201cit certainly appears that we should have been aware that [the researcher] submitted a term that was in conflict with the rules of the platform.\u201d But he said the third-party audits didn\u2019t turn up problems.  The FTC is now investigating Facebook\u2019s privacy controls, but a few questions: Why didn\u2019t the commission ensure years ago that Facebook had established policies to prevent third-party apps from repurposing data? Was the agency too trusting? The Obama campaign app in 2012 exploited data from users and their friends. This may also have violated the FTC consent decree, especially if it shared the data with other liberal groups. Did political considerations influence the FTC\u2019s lax oversight?  These are important questions since Democrats are pressing for more stringent privacy regulations, which Mr. Zuckerberg said he\u2019s open to. But regulation typically benefits incumbents like Facebook that can afford to spend more on compliance while tripping up small competitors. Before establishing new regulations, the FTC should ensure that tech companies abide by their own policies.  Mr. Zuckerberg was also keelhauled for letting Russians exploit the platform in 2016. Facebook has since identified 470 pages and accounts linked to the Russian-controlled Internet Research Agency, which generated at least 200,000 pieces of content over two years. The Russian outfit also bought 3,000 ads on Facebook and Instagram.  The spread of fake news was partly due to Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s refusal to exercise editorial control over content or pay for quality news. Employing people to sift out junk is expensive, though the increased regulation that may come if he doesn\u2019t also isn\u2019t cheap.  But Facebook can\u2019t be held entirely responsible for Russia\u2019s interference. Only the Justice Department can see across media channels and has the power to investigate election fraud, as special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s indictment of 13 Russians in February showed.  The Russians began organizing in 2013 and stole American identities. \u201cBeginning in or around June 2014, and continuing into June 2015, public reporting began to identify operations conducted by the [IRA] in the United States,\u201d the indictment says. The Russian operatives also created fake accounts on Twitter and YouTube. Yet the Obama Administration waited until December 2016 to slap sanctions on Russians for hacking Democratic National Committee emails. It doesn\u2019t appear that social- media interference was ever a priority.  While Facebook has endorsed legislation that would require more disclosure for buyers of political ads, the regulatory burden could make it harder for small companies and blogs to sell ads. This could drive more political advertising to Facebook. And it\u2019s unclear how the legislation would prevent identity fraud.  Democrats are bitter that President Trump won the election and are using Facebook as a scapegoat. Facebook is hardly blameless, but neither is the Obama Administration.", "stock": "FB", "label": -1, "date": "2018-04-11", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/democrats-unfriend-facebook-1523487381"}, {"article": "Facebook Inc., FB 0.40% facing a firestorm over how it handles personal information, says it will make it simpler for users to examine and change some of the data about them that the social network tracks.  The tweaks, announced Wednesday and set to roll out in the coming weeks, include a new, central hub in the Facebook app settings that contains existing tools for users to review and, if desired, delete traces of their Facebook activity such as past posts and search terms. Some other data, such as which ads users clicked on, still won\u2019t be erasable. Facebook says any information users delete is wiped from its servers.  Facebook will also redesign its settings menu for mobile devices, now spread out across almost 20 different screens, and consolidate \u200bits privacy and security options in a single place.  The moves are part of broader changes Facebook is planning to bolster privacy, said Rob Sherman, Facebook\u2019s deputy privacy officer. They come amid intensifying scrutiny from users, regulators and lawmakers over Facebook\u2019s admission on March 16 that user data was improperly obtained by Cambridge Analytica, a data-analytics firm that worked for the 2016 Trump campaign.  The backlash has shaken Facebook and hammered its stock, cleaving more than $95 billion off its market value in just over a week. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg apologized last week for a \u201cmajor breach of trust\u201d in the Cambridge Analytica episode and is expected to testify before U.S. lawmakers on data-use practices next month.  \u201cIt\u2019s been a very intense week,\u201d Mr. Sherman said in an interview. \u201cOne thing that\u2019s been really clear is that we\u2019ve lost people\u2019s trust and need to do a lot of work right away to work on regaining it.\u201d  The Cambridge Analytica revelation showed limits to Facebook\u2019s enforcement of rules governing outsiders\u2019 handling of user data and its ability to see how third parties may have used Facebook data. Facebook says the firm obtained the data, involving potentially tens of millions of users, in violation of its rules from an app developer that was allowed to have the information but not to sell it. It is investigating whether Cambridge Analytica kept the data after Facebook demanded it be deleted in 2015. Cambridge Analytica has said it followed Facebook\u2019s policies.  The episode has prompted renewed attention to how much information about its users Facebook tracks, and accelerated government scrutiny of the social network, which is already under the microscope for its role in allowing Russian-backed groups to use its tools to sway U.S. political discourse before and after the 2016 presidential race.  In a March 21 post, Mr. Zuckerberg said Facebook would investigate and audit app creators who may have abused personal data about Facebook users as well as restrict the amount of information available to developers. At the same time, he said, Facebook is limited in its ability to uncover instances of data misuse because the information is impossible to track once it is downloaded off Facebook servers.  Mr. Sherman also said Facebook faces challenges in determining how data provided to app creators in the past may have been misused over time. But he said the effort is vital. \u201cPeople will only feel comfortable using Facebook if they have confidence that their information will be protected,\u201d he said.  Facebook's current data crisis involving Cambridge Analytica has angered users and prompted government investigations. To understand what's happening now, you have to look back at Facebook's old policies from 2007 to 2014. WSJ's Shelby Holliday explains.

Slideshow (2 Images)  The crash has put a sharp focus on Tesla\u2019s Autopilot technology, which allows drivers to take their hands off the wheel for extended periods under certain conditions. Tesla requires users to agree to keep their hands on the wheel at all times before they can use Autopilot. Users, however, routinely brag they can use the system to drive hands-free.  Tesla said a week after the accident that vehicle logs showed no action had been taken by the driver right before the crash and that he had received earlier warnings to put his hands on the wheel.  The driver, who was 38, died at a nearby hospital shortly after the vehicle hit a concrete highway divider near Mountain View, in the San Francisco Bay Area. The mishap involved two other vehicles.  \u201cThe NTSB is looking into all aspects of this crash including the driver\u2019s previous concerns about the Autopilot,\u201d Christopher O\u2019Neil, another NTSB spokesman, said on April 1.  Last month, the company said that a search of its service records did not \u201cfind anything suggesting that the customer ever complained to Tesla about the performance of Autopilot.

A string of executives have headed for the exits, including a surprising number from the company\u2019s finance team, as Tesla is dogged by questions about whether it can meet its production targets.  The chief financial officer left abruptly last year in a curious turn of events, where he was replaced by his predecessor: Deepak Ahuja served as Tesla\u2019s CFO from 2008 to 2015 and then took over the job again in March 2017, according to his LinkedIn. Then late last year, one of Tesla\u2019s audit committee members, Steve Jurvetson, went on leave from the board (following accusations of misconduct, which he has denied). The vice president of business development and director of battery technology both left in the past year. Jon McNeill, one of Tesla\u2019s most senior executives, went to take the chief operating officer job at Lyft Inc. last month. Eric Branderiz, Tesla\u2019s chief accounting officer, departed last week. And Bloomberg reported this week that Susan Repo, the corporate treasurer and vice president of finance, is out.  The press has rightly been focused on trying to figure out how badly Tesla will miss its production targets for the all-important Model 3 electric sedan. After all, actually building cars is pretty important to Tesla\u2019s business.  Bloomberg built a Tesla Model 3 Tracker. The data show Tesla is producing approximately 737 cars a week. In July, Tesla predicted that it would produce 5,000 Model 3s a week by the end of 2017. Oops.  Tesla has steadily rolled back its production targets and still looks like it will be behind schedule. According to Bloomberg\u2019s analysis, Tesla Model 3 output has actually slowed from February when it was producing something like 936 Model 3s a week. My colleague Dana Hull reported that Tesla temporarily suspended production in late February, potentially explaining the slowdown.  CNBC reported Wednesday that many of the vehicles coming off Tesla\u2019s assembly line required more work. One employee estimated that \u201c40 percent of the parts made or received at its Fremont factor require work,\u201d the article said. Some investors surely found Tesla\u2019s response to the article to be laughable. The company\u2019s statement reads, \u201cIn what world is the pursuit of perfection looked down on? Not one we want to live in.\u201d  Ah yes, a story about how Tesla is producing cars in an inefficient fashion is really about a company with high standards.  On Thursday, the Wall Street Journal declared it \u201cTesla\u2019s Make-Or-Break Moment.\u201d That article rightly points out that Tesla had $3.4 billion of cash at the end of 2017 and that last year it burned $1 billion a quarter. Do the math, and Tesla either needs to generate more revenue or raise more money soon.  The Journal\u2019s story observes that Tesla has a so-called Z-Score (a measure of a company\u2019s financial security) of 1.26. \u201cAny company with a score below 1.8 is considered distressed by many investors. A score of 1.0 or lower suggests bankruptcy is likely within two years,\u201d Tim Higgins and Susan Pulliam write.  The financial markets have given Tesla a long leash, but the evidence against the viability of its business continues to mount. About 23 percent of publicly traded Tesla stock is being used to bet against the automaker. That\u2019s a lot of short sellers.  Of course, Chanos has been warning against Tesla since at least October 2016. \u201cThe whole thing is just sort of this m\u00e9lange of publicly traded and privately traded science projects gone awry. So we\u2019ll see how it works out,\u201d he said at the time. Despite his years-long bets against the company, the stock has been climbing. The Tesla Hype Train keeps going.  But I have to end this piece with a necessary caveat. Despite cash flow concerns, Musk\u2019s companies have generally worked out for investors. Peter Thiel issued what has become a sort of Silicon Valley koan: \u201cNever bet against Elon.\u201d  This article also ran in Bloomberg Technology\u2019s Fully Charged newsletter. Sign up here.  And here\u2019s what you need to know in global technology news  Apparently a photo op with Trump isn\u2019t enough. That\u2019s what Broadcom CEO Hock Tan learned when the U.S. government blocked his attempt to buy Qualcomm. Now chipmakers\u2019s former chairman is trying to raise money to buy Qualcomm, according to the Financial Times.  Silicon Valley\u2019s takeaway from Theranos: The SEC is watching you.

Shares of the Japanese company plunged as much as 9 percent after a spate of Tesla bad-news stories over the past few weeks. First, the U.S. electric-car maker reported yet another fatal crash, then a shortfall in production targets for its mass-market Model 3 and to top it off, a rating downgrade by Moody's Investors Service on liquidity concerns. The cost to insure Panasonic's five-year debt -- a broad gauge of risk -- has risen sharply.  That Panasonic is dancing to Tesla's tune is no big surprise -- it usually does. Investors have long seen the electronics giant as a derivative play on its U.S. customer. Their thesis: more Teslas, more batteries. To be fair, Panasonic does have solid battery technology -- better than the likes of Samsung SDI Co. -- and has focused its efforts on the auto industry. In fact, moments of weakness in Panasonic stock are often seen as an opportune time to buy. This time, there are other factors to consider.  Out of Sync Panasonic risks putting too many eggs in one basket Bloomberg  First, the level of Panasonic's reliance. The Osaka-based company revised down its sales and operating profit estimates for rechargeable batteries for the full fiscal year in February because it had to push out sales plans in North America to \u201cfuture periods.\u201d Its hyped-up gigafactory partnership with Tesla in Nevada has undershot expectations. Panasonic is piling capex into the $5 billion project, in part raising debt to do so. Moody's expects the company to shovel more than 50 percent of its capital spending into the automotive segment including battery plants.  Besides Tesla, Panasonic leans heavily on the broader electric-vehicle industry, where prospects are dimming amid the Trump administration's lackluster interest in green policies. Earlier this month, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it was revising fuel-efficiency standards that allow carmakers \"to make cars that people both want and can afford.\" That damped enthusiasm for the potential growth of electric cars.  Then, there's China, the world's largest electric-vehicle market. Panasonic, along with other foreign battery makers, risks being shut out by new-energy policies aimed at cornering the global market. China's own battery champion, Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., is shoving global competitors aside as it ramps up production and pushes down prices, while reaching standards to supply the likes of BMW AG.  Panasonic started making batteries for hybrid cars in the northeastern city of Dalian only last month, entering a market that's increasingly looking saturated as growing volumes put pressure on margins. Tesla, meanwhile, which sells in China only through exports, may also be at risk of being drawn into the ongoing trade spat with the U.S.  Ahead of the Pack Panasonic trades at a premium to its South Korea battery maker peers Bloomberg  Panasonic stock is down around 7 percent this year in Tokyo and trades at a premium to its South Korean battery peers on 14.4 times forward earnings. Tesla has rebounded from a beating in the U.S. as the eternal optimists fueling its rise re-emerge. But investors should be careful about jumping back into the batteries that power this ride.

Simec Zen Energy, controlled by the U.K. executive\u2019s GFG Alliance, agreed to build a 120-megawatt lithium-ion battery at Port Augusta in South Australia, State Premier Jay Weatherill said in an emailed statement Friday. While no timeline was given for completion, the battery size would exceed Musk\u2019s 100-megawatt unit in the same state\u2019s outback, which holds the current record. Other rivals may also overtake Musk including a South Korean project.  GFG, which last year added steel operations to iron ore mines in Australia, said the battery will help power a 200 megawatt solar farm at its Whyalla steelworks. Simec Zen hopes its Big Battery Project will provide grid stability and act as a buffer to power outages, which have included a state-wide blackout in September 2016.  \u201cAs well as being the most powerful battery in the world, Simec Zen\u2019s storage facility will help underpin the long-term viability of the Whyalla steelworks as well as provide additional benefits to the South Australian grid,\u201d Weatherill said.  The battery-storage industry is becoming increasingly important in places like South Australia, which has less access to traditional fossil-fuel sources like coal and gas than the rest of the nation.

On Thursday evening, Tesla filed with regulators to disclose precisely this:  On March 7, 2018, Eric Branderiz left Tesla for personal reasons. Tesla appreciates Eric's service to the company.  Brevity, the soul of wit, is perhaps the specter of foreboding in this case. Branderiz was hired from SunPower Corp. in October 2016 to be Tesla's corporate controller and chief accountant. His base salary was $300,000 a year, but the real draw was a $5 million equity grant to vest over four years. To be clear, I don't know what his personal reasons are. Regardless, that vesting schedule suggests he's leaving a chunk of money on the table.  He isn't the only high-profile departure. The last one was announced a month ago on Tesla's earnings call by none other than CEO Elon Musk, with not just brevity but a hint of insouciance:  Actually, one thing we forgot to mention is John McNeill, who is heading up our sales and service group, is departing the company. We wish him well in his future career. And going forward, I will be having the sales and service report directly to me. There are no plans to search for a replacement.  Just the guy running the sales effort during possibly the most critical launch of a Tesla vehicle yet. No biggie.  Actually, that is kind of how the bond market seems to be taking it. Those bonds mentioned above are now yielding about 6.3 percent, a full percentage point above their coupon. But the spreads betray a more laid-back attitude:  So? Tesla's bond yield is up but that's down to Treasuries selling off rather than a blowout in spreads Source: Bloomberg  These spreads actually looked low even before the news of Branderiz's departure, considering Tesla's growing reliance on negative working capital to fund its operations (see this) and its net debt doubling last year to $6.8 billion (see this).  There's more to be found off the balance sheet, too. According to Tesla's annual filing, which dropped a couple of weeks ago, it's potentially on the hook for an estimated $8.5 billion of contracted purchases over the next three years alone. Most of this relates to batteries coming from Panasonic Corp. and emphasizes the importance of Model 3 production catching up with the vast ambitions set ahead of it.  Much Obliged Tesla's contractual obligations, related mainly to battery purchases, are bigger than its long-term debt Source: Company filing  That fixed-income investors are fine with this is, of course, a function of their primary defense; namely, Tesla's gravity-defying stock price. The potential for an eighth equity sale to refill company coffers serves to salve any wounds inflicted by slipping Model 3 targets or senior managers sipping away. In early trading on Friday morning, the shares were down less than 1 percent.  Like I Said: So? Tesla's share price shrugs off setbacks with remarkable ease Source: Bloomberg  What might cause the market's confidence to crack? It's impossible to say, though the Model 3's woes represent the most acute threat. We are now just over three weeks away from the March 31 deadline to get weekly production up to 2,500; a target that's been reset several times already. Bloomberg's own tracker estimates the current rate at less than 700.  It's worth pointing out that Adam Jonas, Morgan Stanley's usually bullish analyst on Tesla, on Friday morning issued a new report that offered a curious cocktail combining optimism about the company overcoming its immediate problems with the notion that investors might use that outcome to \"exit\" the stock. The rationale is that even if Tesla gets the Model 3 going, competitive pressure and vast infrastructure needs to realize the company's ambitions will constrain it. As Jonas puts it:  We had harbored greater conviction on the long side, as we felt that investors underestimated the scope of the addressable market and the value of Tesla\u2019s platform (hardware, software, people, physical infrastructure and network effect).

In August, they lined up for the chance to finance Tesla Inc.\u2019s ambitious rollout of its Model 3 sedan. Wooed by Musk\u2019s personal appeals, bond investors pretty much ignored the carmaker\u2019s prolific cash burn and repeated failures to meet production targets and lent it $1.8 billion at record-low interest rates.  But now, after a spate of fresh setbacks in the past week, including a fatal Tesla crash and a credit-rating downgrade, bondholders are asking hard questions about whether Musk can deliver on his bold promise to bring electric cars to the masses before the company runs out of cash.

Everyone is worried.\u201d  The consequences are significant. Tesla\u2019s woes have played out most visibly in the stock market, with its shares suffering a two-day, 15 percent drop that\u2019s the biggest since 2016. But surging borrowing costs, which are now near 8 percent, could hamper the carmaker\u2019s ability to finance itself at a critical time.  For Bloomberg\u2019s Tesla Model 3 production tracker, click here.  A representative for Tesla didn\u2019t immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.  The company, which has never shown an annual profit in the 15 years since it was founded, will need to raise over $2 billion to cover not only its cash burn this year, but also about $1.2 billion of debt that comes due by 2019, Moody\u2019s Investors Service analyst Bruce Clark said in a report Tuesday.  Tesla is burning through money so fast that, without additional financing, it would run out of cash before year-end. To put that into perspective, that amounts to more than $6,500 every minute of every day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  \u2018Crunch Time\u2019  That puts the company in \u201ccrunch time\u201d now to improve margins, Cowen & Co. analysts led by Jeffrey Osborne said in a note Tuesday. Tesla will report first-quarter production figures for the Model 3 early next week. While the company has said it expects to end the quarter making 2,500 Model 3s per week, analysts are skeptical.  The Tesla Model 3. Photographer: Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg  \u201cBased on our own checks as well as user reported registration data found online, Tesla\u2019s model 3 ramp is likely still moving slower than management\u2019s previously pushed out targets,\u201d Osborne wrote.  Another production miss wouldn\u2019t make it any easier for Tesla to persuade bond investors to hand over more money. While shareholders just approved a massive $2.6 billion pay package for Musk, three executives have headed for the exits this quarter, including two from the company\u2019s finance team.  \u2018On The Precipice\u2019  \u201cPeople are looking at the abyss here, they\u2019re looking at it spiral out of control,\u201d said Jack Flaherty, a portfolio manager at GAM Holding AG. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely on the precipice.\u201d  To Diamond Hill\u2019s Zox, who didn\u2019t buy Tesla\u2019s bonds last year, yields are still too low to offset the risks of lending to a business in its early growth phase. They would need be between 10 to 12 percent to get him interested.  And with a junk rating of Caa1 from Moody\u2019s on Tesla\u2019s unsecured bonds -- seven levels below investment grade -- coming back to the market might prove to be too onerous in any case, says Bloomberg Intelligence\u2019s Joel Levington.  The company might need to consider selling equity, issuing convertible bonds and structured debt or taking out bank loans, he said.  \u201cI would think it\u2019d be off the table,\u201d said Levington, referring to another unsecured bond sale. \u201cThey have to look at all options.\u201d  \u2014 With assistance by Austin Weinstein, Dana Hull, Sally Bakewell, Taka Endo, and Claire Boston", "stock": "TSLA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-28", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-28/tesla-bonds-down-to-86-cents-start-to-flash-warning-signals"}, {"article": "Bryan Logan/Business Insider  Tesla has Supercharger stations all over the map, and in 2018, as thousands of new Tesla owners hit the road in newly minted Tesla Model 3 sedans \u2014 the company's first entry-level electric car \u2014 those drivers will be looking for convenient places to plug in their cars.

The National Transportation Safety Board is currently investigating the crash.  Tesla says it willingly withdrew from NTSB investigation  Tesla says it willingly withdrew from the party agreement with the National Transportation Safety Board, adding that the NTSB is more concerned with \u201cpress headlines than actually promoting safety,\u201d a Tesla spokesperson told TechCrunch via email. \u201cLast week, in a conversation with the NTSB, we were told that if we made additional statements before their 12-24 month investigative process is complete, we would no longer be a party to the investigation agreement,\u201d a Tesla spokesperson said in a statement to TechCrunch. \u201cOn Tuesday, we chose to withdraw from the agreement and issued a statement to correct misleading claims that had been made about Autopilot \u2014 claims which made it seem as though Autopilot creates safety problems when the opposite is true.\u201d This comes after the NTSB said it revoked Tesla\u2019s party status in the investigation regarding the fatal crash involving one of Tesla\u2019s Model X cars. The NTSB said it did so because Tesla, without permission from the NTSB, relayed information to the public regarding the investigation. Tesla went on to note the prevalence of automotive fatalities in the United States in comparison to fatalities involving cars with Autopilot. Tesla says for every 320 million miles cars equipped with Autopilot drive, there is one fatality, including known pedestrian fatalities. That\u2019s compared to one fatality for every 86 million miles driven for all vehicles, Tesla said. \u201cIf you are driving a Tesla equipped with Autopilot hardware, you are 3.7 times less likely to be involved in a fatal accident and this continues to improve,\u201d the spokesperson said. Tesla also alleges its \u201cclear in our conversations\u201d with the NTSB that it cares less about safety and more about press headlines. \u201cAmong other things, they repeatedly released partial bits of incomplete information to the media in violation of their own rules, at the same time that they were trying to prevent us from telling all the facts,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe this is right and we will be making an official complaint to Congress. We will also be issuing a Freedom Of Information Act request to understand the reasoning behind their focus on the safest cars in America while they ignore the cars that are the least safe. Perhaps there is a sound rationale for this, but we cannot imagine what that could possibly be.\u201d Tesla also took time to note how the NTSB is an advisory body, rather than a regulatory one, and how Tesla has a \u201cstrong and positive relationship\u201d with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) \u201cWhen tested by NHTSA, Model S and Model X each received five stars not only overall but in every sub-category,\u201d the Tesla spokesperson said. \u201cThis was the only time an SUV had ever scored that well. Moreover, of all the cars that NHTSA has ever tested, Model S and Model X scored as the two cars with the lowest probability of injury. There is no company that cares more about safety and the evidence speaks for itself.\u201d When reached for comment pertaining to Tesla\u2019s claims, the NTSB says it stands by the press release it issued earlier and has nothing to add. Meanwhile, the NHTSA says its investigation is ongoing. \u201cThe agency is in contact with local investigators, consistent with NHTSA\u2019s vigilant oversight and authority over the safety of all motor vehicles and equipment,\u201d an NHTSA spokesperson said in a statement to TechCrunch. \u201cNHTSA is dispatching its Special Crash Investigation Team and will take action as appropriate.\u201d  Tesla is no longer working with NTSB in fatal Model X crash investigation  In light of Tesla going a bit rogue and disclosing details of the fatal crash that involved Autopilot, the National Transportation Safety Board is removing Tesla as a party in the investigation. \u201cThe NTSB took this action because Tesla violated the party agreement by releasing investigative information before it was vetted and confirmed by the NTSB,\u201d the NTSB wrote in a press release today. \u201cSuch releases of incomplete information often lead to speculation and incorrect assumptions about the probable cause of a crash, which does a disservice to the investigative process and the traveling public.\u201d This is not too surprising, given the NTSB said it was \u201cunhappy\u201d with Tesla following its March 30 disclosure that Autopilot was engaged during the crash. Losing party status means Tesla is no longer able to provide technical assistance to the NTSB. As the NTSB notes, having party status is a \u201cprivilege\u201d that enables two-way information sharing. \u201cIt is unfortunate that Tesla, by its actions, did not abide by the party agreement,\u201d said NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt. \u201cWe decided to revoke Tesla\u2019s party status and informed Mr. Musk in a phone call last evening and via letter today. While we understand the demand for information that parties face during an NTSB investigation, uncoordinated releases of incomplete information do not further transportation safety or serve the public interest.\u201d The NTSB says it\u2019s rare to revoke party status, but that it has happened before. While Tesla is no longer an official party, the NTSB says it expects Tesla to cooperate with any future data requests. While Tesla is no longer a party in this specific case, the company is still working with the NTSB in other investigations, like the one pertaining to a crash in Lake Forest, California and one in Culver City. On Wednesday, Tesla provided Bloomberg with a statement implying Tesla willingly withdrew from the party agreement. \u201cTesla withdrew from the party agreement with the NTSB because it requires that we not release information about Autopilot to the public, a requirement which we believe fundamentally affects public safety negatively,\u201d the company said in a statement to Bloomberg. \u201cWe believe in transparency, so an agreement that prevents public release of information for over a year is unacceptable.\u201d In a lengthy statement, Tesla said it willingly chose to withdraw from the agreement: Last week, in a conversation with the NTSB, we were told that if we made additional statements before their 12-24 month investigative process is complete, we would no longer be a party to the investigation agreement. On Tuesday, we chose to withdraw from the agreement and issued a statement to correct misleading claims that had been made about Autopilot \u2014 claims which made it seem as though Autopilot creates safety problems when the opposite is true. In the US, there is one automotive fatality every 86 million miles across all vehicles. For Tesla, there is one fatality, including known pedestrian fatalities, every 320 million miles in vehicles equipped with Autopilot hardware. If you are driving a Tesla equipped with Autopilot hardware, you are 3.7 times less likely to be involved in a fatal accident and this continues to improve. It\u2019s been clear in our conversations with the NTSB that they\u2019re more concerned with press headlines than actually promoting safety. Among other things, they repeatedly released partial bits of incomplete information to the media in violation of their own rules, at the same time that they were trying to prevent us from telling all the facts. We don\u2019t believe this is right and we will be making an official complaint to Congress. We will also be issuing a Freedom Of Information Act request to understand the reasoning behind their focus on the safest cars in America while they ignore the cars that are the least safe. Perhaps there is a sound rationale for this, but we cannot imagine what that could possibly be. Something the public may not be aware of is that the NTSB is not a regulatory body, it is an advisory body. The regulatory body for the automotive industry in the US is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) with whom we have a strong and positive relationship. After doing a comprehensive study, NHTSA found that even the early version of Tesla Autopilot resulted in 40% fewer crashes. Autopilot has improved substantially since then. When tested by NHTSA, Model S and Model X each received five stars not only overall but in every sub-category. This was the only time an SUV had ever scored that well. Moreover, of all the cars that NHTSA has ever tested, Model S and Model X scored as the two cars with the lowest probability of injury. There is no company that cares more about safety and the evidence speaks for itself.  NTSB is \u2018unhappy\u2019 about Tesla publicly disclosing details of fatal crash  Tesla provided some more details on Friday about the fatal crash involving one of its Model X vehicles, but the National Transportation Safety Board isn\u2019t particularly happy about that, The Washington Post first reported. \u201cIn each of our investigations involving a Tesla vehicle, Tesla has been extremely cooperative on assisting with the vehicle data,\u201d NTSB spokesperson Chris O\u2019Neil told TechCrunch \u201cHowever, the NTSB is unhappy with the release of investigative information by Tesla.\u201d That\u2019s because those involved in an NTSB investigation are required to inform the Board of information releases before doing so. \u201cThe uncoordinated release of investigative information can affect how other parties work with us in the future so we take each unauthorized release seriously,\u201d O\u2019Neil told TechCrunch. \u201cHowever, this release will not hinder our investigation.\u201d Last week, Tesla said Autopilot, the company\u2019s semi-autonomous mode that can change lanes and maintain proper vehicle positions and safe speeds, was engaged in the moments leading up to the crash. \u201cThe driver had received several visual and one audible hands-on warning earlier in the drive and the driver\u2019s hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds prior to the collision,\u201d Tesla wrote in a blog post. \u201cThe driver had about five seconds and 150 meters of unobstructed view of the concrete divider with the crushed crash attenuator, but the vehicle logs show that no action was taken.\u201d While Tesla and the NTSB have made some early observations, there\u2019s still more work to be done as part of the investigation. The NTSB, for example, still needs Tesla\u2019s help to decode the data the vehicle recorded and ultimately determine the \u201cprobable cause\u201d of the crash, NTSB spokesperson O\u2019Neil told the Post. The investigation has also expanded to look into the concerns the driver had previously expressed about Autopilot. Walter Huang, the owner of the car who died as a result of the crash, had previously taken his car into the Tesla dealership, saying his car had a way of veering toward the exact barrier his car hit, ABC7 reported last week. Tesla, however, says it has no record of Huang complaining about Autopilot. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing a thorough search of our service records and we cannot find anything suggesting that the customer ever complained to Tesla about the performance of Autopilot,\u201d a Tesla spokesperson told TechCrunch. \u201cThere was a concern raised once about navigation not working correctly, but Autopilot\u2019s performance is unrelated to navigation.\u201d Tesla declined to comment on the NTSB\u2019s concerns.  Tesla says fatal crash involved Autopilot  Tesla has provided another update to last week\u2019s fatal crash. As it turns out, Tesla said the driver had Autopilot on with the adaptive cruise control follow-distance set to minimum. However, it seems the driver ignored the vehicle\u2019s warnings to take back control. \u201cThe driver had received several visual and one audible hands-on warning earlier in the drive and the driver\u2019s hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds prior to the collision,\u201d Tesla wrote in a blog post. \u201cThe driver had about five seconds and 150 meters of unobstructed view of the concrete divider with the crushed crash attenuator, but the vehicle logs show that no action was taken.\u201d The promise of Tesla\u2019s Autopilot system is to reduce car accidents. In the company\u2019s blog post, Tesla notes Autopilot reduces crash rates by 40 percent, according to an independent review by the U.S. government. Of course, that does not mean the technology is perfect in preventing all accidents. As Tesla previously noted, the crash was so severe because the middle divider on the highway had been damaged in an earlier accident. Tesla also cautioned that Autopilot does not prevent all accidents, but it does make them less likely to occur. No one knows about the accidents that didn\u2019t happen, only the ones that did. The consequences of the public not using Autopilot, because of an inaccurate belief that it is less safe, would be extremely severe. There are about 1.25 million automotive deaths worldwide. If the current safety level of a Tesla vehicle were to be applied, it would mean about 900,000 lives saved per year. We expect the safety level of autonomous cars to be 10 times safer than non-autonomous cars. In the past, when we have brought up statistical safety points, we have been criticized for doing so, implying that we lack empathy for the tragedy that just occurred. Nothing could be further from the truth. We care deeply for and feel indebted to those who chose to put their trust in us. However, we must also care about people now and in the future whose lives may be saved if they know that Autopilot improves safety. None of this changes how devastating an event like this is or how much we feel for our customer\u2019s family and friends. We are incredibly sorry for their loss. This development, of course, comes in light of a fatal accident involving one of Uber\u2019s self-driving cars in Tempe, Arizona.  What Tesla knows about the fatal Model X crash  Tesla has shed some more light on the fatal crash and fire involving a Model X car last week. In a blog post tonight, Tesla said it\u2019s not yet clear what happened in the time leading up to the accident. Tesla also said it does not yet know what caused it. Tesla did note that, according to its data, Tesla owners have driven that same stretch of Highway 101 with Autopilot engaged about 85,000 times since Tesla first rolled out the automated control system in 2015. Since the beginning of this year, Tesla drivers have successfully handled that stretch of the highway 20,000 times, according to Tesla. \u201cThe reason this crash was so severe is that the crash attenuator, a highway safety barrier which is designed to reduce the impact into a concrete lane divider, had either been removed or crushed in a prior accident without being replaced,\u201d the company wrote. Below, you can see what the barrier was supposed to look like versus what it looked like the day before the accident. Tesla says it obtained the image of the more recent photo from the dash cam of a witness who regularly makes the commute. The company went on to say it has \u201cnever seen this level of damage to a Model X in any other crash.\u201d As previously reported, the accident also caused a fire. In the event there is a fire, Tesla says its battery packs are designed so that people have enough time to get out of the car. \u201cAccording to witnesses, that appears to be what happened here as we understand there were no occupants still in the Model X by the time the fire could have presented a risk,\u201d Tesla wrote. \u201cSerious crashes like this can result in fire regardless of the type of car, and Tesla\u2019s billions of miles of actual driving data shows that a gas car in the United States is five times more likely to experience a fire than a Tesla vehicle.\u201d The promise of Tesla\u2019s Autopilot system is to reduce car accidents. In the company\u2019s blog post, Tesla notes Autopilot reduces crash rates by 40 percent, according to an independent review by the U.S. government. Of course, that does not mean the technology is perfect in preventing all accidents.

This is the second fatal crash in which the Autopilot system had been engaged, including a 2016 crash in Florida that killed a Tesla driver. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration concluded that the Florida crash did not result from a flaw in the system, but the agency found that the system lacked safeguards to prevent its misuse.

As CEO of Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink and Hyperloop, he\u2019s overseeing everything from launching a 12,000-satellite broadband network to building a NYC-to-DC hyperloop to installing computers in our brains .  But with Tesla struggling to hit its production numbers for the new Tesla Model 3 , Musk has stepped in place of his senior vice president of engineering to directly oversee manufacturing at the factory.  Musk had previously tweeted that Tesla would hit 20,000 Model 3 cars manufactured per month by December of last year. He later amended his prediction, stating that by the end of 2018\u2019s spring quarter, Tesla would produce 500 Model 3s per day, or 2,500 per week.  After Jalopink exposed a company memo from Musk stating that the company could now make 2,000 cars per week, and The Information revealed that Musk had taken control of manufacturing, Musk responded angrily on Twitter, but didn\u2019t contradict the claims.  About a year ago, I asked Doug to manage both engineering & production. He agreed that Tesla needed eng & prod better aligned, so we don\u2019t design cars that are crazy hard to build. Right now, tho, better to divide & conquer, so I\u2019m back to sleeping at factory. Car biz is hell \u2026April 2, 2018  Last week, VP Doug Field sent a memo to employees announcing Tesla would reallocate employees to focus on Model 3 production, Bloomberg reported.  He called the industry experts who doubted Tesla\u2019s ability to hit their manufacturing goals \u201ca bunch of haters\u201d and urged employees to work hard to hit the 300-car-per-day milestone.  Tesla\u2019s numbers did rise significantly that week, but Field\u2019s petition to may have been too little, too late for Musk.  Now Musk is sleeping at Tesla\u2019s Gigafactory in Nevada, hoping to ensure Tesla hits its benchmark of 5,000 Model 3s per week by the end of June.  Elon Musk pretended Tesla had gone bankrupt in an April Fools tweet (Courtesy of Elon Musk) (Image: \u00a9 Elon Musk)  In response to this news, Tesla issued a press release with manufacturing numbers for spring 2018.  In the past seven days Tesla made 2,020 Model 3 cars, out of 8,180 total for 2018. For comparison, Telsa also produced 11,730 Model S cars and 10,070 Model X cars this spring, totalling almost 30,000 vehicles.  If Tesla reaches its goal of producing 5,000 per week for the Model 3, then producing 30,000 cars would only take a month and a half. And that wouldn\u2019t even include the Model S and X cars being produced at the same time.  Next week, Tesla reportedly plans to produce 2,000 Model 3s and 2,000 Model S and X cars within seven days. Despite not hitting their Q1 goals, Tesla\u2019s release insists the company is \u201con track\u201d to hit their production numbers for the 3, S and X in 2018.  A race against time and controversy  This news is just the latest in a series of negative press Tesla and Musk have dealt with in the past week.  After Tesla discovered a steering defect in the Model S cars , the company voluntarily recalled 123,000 Model S models for garage repairs. Thankfully, no accidents have been associated with this defect.  But Tesla\u2019s Autopilot is implicated in a fatal Model X crash currently being reviewed by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).  Tesla said in a statement that Autopilot gave the driver \u201cseveral visual and one audible hands-on warning\u201d to avoid the crash, but that the driver did not take action.  All Tesla Model 3 cars have Autopilot enabled, and Tesla said Model 3 drivers are \u201c3.7 times less likely to be involved in a fatal accident\u201d using Autopilot than when driving themselves.  But the NTSB is reportedly \u201cunhappy\u201d that Tesla released confidential investigative knowledge to the public before the agency could issue its own preliminary report on Autopilot.  In a tweet yesterday, Musk defended the decision to discuss the accident, saying Tesla has an obligation to \u201cpublic safety\u201d.  Lot of respect for NTSB, but NHTSA regulates cars, not NTSB, which is an advisory body. Tesla releases critical crash data affecting public safety immediately & always will. To do otherwise would be unsafe.April 2, 2018  With all of these legal distractions and weekly SpaceX launches, will Musk be able to spur on Model 3 manufacturing time? It remains to be seen how Musk will streamline manufacturing directly, though the recent numbers are encouraging for Tesla.

The thought of never having to fill up your car at a gas station may sound like a dream, but it\u2019s very much a reality that plenty of Tesla owners enjoy already.  Unlike a hybrid, Tesla is an electric vehicle that will need to be charged up in order to be driven. While a Hybrid vehicle can operate on battery power for a short period, it primarily still requires regular petrol to operate on the roads.  Charging infrastructure is still very much in its infancy in the UAE, it\u2019s only set to grow in the coming years, as more and more people start to embrace electric vehicles.  So if you\u2019ve got some burning questions about Tesla, here\u2019s a handy guide to everything you\u2019ll need to know about owning a Tesla in Dubai.  Does it really not need any fuel? How much would I save in fuel costs?  That\u2019s right \u2013 you\u2019ll never need to put a drop of petrol in your Tesla. It has practically zero emissions, and runs 100% off battery power. What\u2019s more, the front space where you\u2019d normally find a car engine is now replaced by a front trunk, so you get extra storage space for your things.  For a single charge at home, you would pay approximate AED 23 for a full charge. Compare that with about AED 160 for a full tank for a Mercedes E-Class E350 Sedan 3.5L, 2017 model for approximately the same range, and you can see how much you can save in a month.  Charging: How do I charge a Tesla, where do I charge it and how long does it take to charge?  There are three main ways to charge a Tesla:  Standard Wall Charger: This comes with any Tesla car, and allows you to plug your car into any standard 3-pin socket and recharge it. This is also the slowest way to recharge your Tesla.  Destination Charger: These chargers are available at places like certain hotels or shopping malls. They charge your Tesla much faster than a Standard Wall Charger, and will add about 100km of distance with a single hour of charge. You can also get a special home version of the Destination Charger installed for your personal use for around AED 2,000.  Supercharger: This is the fastest way to charge your Tesla, with a full charge taking a little under an hour. Superchargers are generally installed at the borders of most cities, and are designed so that on long journeys your Tesla has enough charge to get from one Supercharger to another.  Destination charging stations are available at most shopping malls in Dubai and in Abu Dhabi. There is one Supercharger available in Masdar City in Abu Dhabi, and one available at Last Exit at Jebel Ali in Dubai.  Assuming a 100 kWh battery with 565km of mileage, a Standard Wall Charger would take about 22 hours, a Destination Charger would take about 5 hours, and a Supercharger would take about 72 minutes.  Charging at a Destination Charger is completely free. Each year, owners receive 400 kWh of free Supercharger credit, enough to drive about 1600 km \u2013 any charging above this is charged at a nominal fee. For charging at home, you\u2019ll incur any charges to your normal electricity bill, but these again will be much cheaper than filling your car with petrol.  How far can I drive on a full charge and what happens if I run out of charge?  A 100D Model S is quoted as having about 594km of range on a full charge. However, this is purely on paper \u2013 this distance is dramatically reduced when you take into account the outside temperature and what speed the air conditioning is on. With an outside temperature of 40C and the air conditioning running at a medium speed, you\u2019ll get about 548km of range on a full charge.  Just like with a normal car that runs out of petrol, you\u2019ll have to call a service truck and get your car towed. The only difference is that you\u2019ll have to get it towed to a nearby charger, rather than a gas station.  Lets talk numbers: How much does a Tesla cost and what about insurance and maintenance?  A Tesla Model S starts from around AED 270,000, while the Model X starts from around AED 330,000. These are base model prices, which will obviously increase as you customize or add more features to your car.  With regards to insurance, according to Jonathan Rawling, CFO, of compareit4me, \u201cFor the Model S, based on its value and power, we\u2019d estimate that a fully comprehensive insurance policy would cost between AED 8,000 and AED 12,000 for the Model X. However, that number could vary wildly depending on the primary driver\u2019s age, nationality and no-claims record. The spare parts issue would also come into play, too.\u201d  These approximate insurance costs are on par with say a Mercedes E-Class E350 Sedan 3.5L, 2017 model.  At the moment service costs aren\u2019t quite apparent as Tesla is only just launching, but given that there are less moving parts in a Tesla than a standard car engine, we\u2019d expect services to be less frequent and be less expensive. A Tesla\u2019s battery lasts around ten years before needing to be replaced, which in theory would be the only major part that you\u2019d replace.  Does the Autopilot feature work in Dubai?  To some extent, yes. When driving long distances you\u2019ll be able to switch on Autopilot to have the car stay within your lane and maintain a safe distance from the car in front of you. It\u2019s a system that is still under testing in the UAE, so there will be some restrictions in place and Tesla has already warned that drivers are still expected to keep their hands on the wheel and stay alert at all times.

After its infamous Falcon 9 explosion in 2016, SpaceX had a lot riding on a successful launch of its newest and most powerful spacecraft to date.  But over 2.3 million livestream viewers on YouTube (the second biggest stream ever for the service) witnessed a breathtaking, successful launch. The Falcon Heavy escaped atmosphere, launched its payload and returned at least two of its three boosters to their target destinations, all within ten minutes.  [Update: Elon Musk has confirmed the center core missed the drone ship it was meant to land on, reports Engadget . It's the one blemish on an otherwise wildly successful day. The core booster apparently ran out of propellant, meaning it couldn't slow down enough to pull off a successful landing. It also missed the drone ship itself by about 100 meters. Though no footage has been released, it sounds as though the crash landing was quite spectacular.]  Here's a breakdown of every exciting moment of the launch and what the test run means for the future of the commercial space industry and Mars exploration.  Falcon Heavy launch, as it happened  On Tuesday, February 6 at 12:45pm PT/3:45pm ET/ 8:45pm GMT, or 6:45am AEST on Wednesday, February 7, the Falcon Heavy rocket launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida. Within a minute, it hit supersonic speeds, while raucous cheering could be heard by the SpaceX team over the livestream.  At the 2 minute 30 second mark, the rocket's two side boosters shut down and successfully separated from the spacecraft, with Earth\u2019s atmosphere already visible in the background. At 3 minute 15 seconds, and with David Bowie\u2019s Life on Mars playing in the background, the main engine was cut off and released from the craft.  Tesla in space! (Image: \u00a9 SpaceX)  At four minutes, the Tesla Roadster payload was successfully launched out of the craft into its elliptical orbit between Earth and Mars. SpaceX\u2019s spaceman is projected to reach Mars in about six months.  Within eight minutes, the two side boosters had successfully landed directly on their target launch pad. The primary center core, meanwhile, failed to land on the drone ship it was intended to touch down on, missing it by about 100 meters and coming in at about 300mph.  Side boosters land successfully (Image: \u00a9 SpaceX)  Why the Falcon Heavy launch matters  Fans of the book/film The Martian know that you can\u2019t fit everything you need for a visit to Mars on one spacecraft. NASA needs a safe, cost-effective way to transport supplies and tech to the planet well before sending astronauts along.  SpaceX\u2019s Falcon Heavy is the latest in Musk\u2019s rocket lineup looking to fill that niche. It can carry 64 metric tons into orbit, is fully reusable for later launches (if the launch is successful), and only costs $90 million to build.  The cargo for today\u2019s launch was Elon Musk\u2019s personal Tesla Roadster, which was equipped with cameras and a test dummy. The Tesla\u2019s successful cruise towards its destination proves that the Falcon Heavy will be able to carry sensitive technology (and even people) outside of orbit for Mars exploration or colonization.  Tesla Roadster and its 'Starman' passenger in space  The Heavy isn\u2019t the most powerful rocket ever \u2013 that title belongs to the Saturn V, which launched all of the Apollo missions to the moon, and could carry more than double the Falcon\u2019s payload to low-Earth orbit (LEO).  But compared to everyone else building rockets right now, SpaceX is outpacing the competition. NPR reports that the United Launch Alliance\u2019s Delta IV Heavy, the Falcon Heavy\u2019s closest competitor, can only carry half of the Heavy\u2019s payload, and for three times the cost. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos' New Glenn rocket stands almost thirty meters taller than the Falcon Heavy, but it\u2019s designed specifically for staying in Earth\u2019s orbit and could never reach Mars.  NASA is currently developing the Space Launch System (SLS), designed for the same purpose as Falcon Heavy: transporting astronauts \u2013 and, potentially, colonists \u2013 to Mars. According to CNN Money , the SLS won\u2019t launch a test flight until next year, but it should be about 40 meters taller than the Heavy, with potentially double the Falcon Heavy\u2019s liftoff thrust and LEO payload.  However, what we don\u2019t know is how much the SLS costs. New York Times sources claim that NASA might simply scrap the SLS and hire SpaceX\u2019s rockets for the Mars mission instead, considering their cost-effectiveness.  Today\u2019s successful launch could serve as a convincing pitch to NASA that it should sit back and let SpaceX facilitate the agency's Mars missions, despite the center core's failure to land on the drone ship.  Meanwhile, competitors like the Alliance will be feeling the pressure to replicate SpaceX\u2019s success as soon as possible. If it turns out the main engine did make it back home, they may already be too late to beat SpaceX\u2019s amazing first impression.  SpaceX\u2019s next steps  Credit: SpaceX (Image: \u00a9 SpaceX)  Even after an extremely successful launch and two out of three boosters making it back to Earth, this may only be considered a stepping stone in the history of Mars exploration.  In September of last year, Musk announced SpaceX's latest rocket design, the Big Falcon Rocket (BFR), designed to replace and cannibalize the designs of the Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy and Dragon capsule into one package.  According to SpaceX\u2019s projections, the BFR will be able to carry 50 tonnes to Mars and 150 tonnes to LEO (the Falcon Heavy can carry 16.8 and 63.8 tonnes to the Red Planet, respectively), and it\u2019ll only use one booster instead of three. Plus, there's the claim that its pastiche design will make BFR much cheaper than the Falcon Heavy.

The wreckage of a Tesla vehicle after it crashed into a barrier on U.S. Highway 101 in Mountain View, Calif., last month. Photo: stringer/Reuters  The National Transportation Safety Board expressed displeasure with Tesla TSLA 2.13% Inc.\u2019s recent disclosure that the company\u2019s semiautonomous driving system was activated before a fatal crash last month in California.  The agency, which dispatched a team last week to investigate the March 23 crash, said Sunday it is \u201cunhappy\u201d that Tesla revealed detailed information it had gleaned from vehicle logs about the collision, including its suggestion that the driver had time to put his hands on the wheel and react.  Tesla declined to comment Sunday about the NTSB statement.  The rare rebuke from the U.S. agency, which investigates significant accidents involving various transportation modes, comes amid mounting scrutiny of partial and fully automated driving technologies. The NTSB is also probing the March 18 death of a pedestrian fatally struck by an Uber Technologies Inc. self-driving vehicle with a safety operator behind the wheel in Tempe, Ariz.  Not long after the NTSB expressed its disapproval Sunday, Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk joked on Twitter that the company was going bankrupt. \u201cDespite intense efforts to raise money, including a last-ditch mass sale of Easter eggs, we are sad to report that Tesla has gone completely and totally bankrupt,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSo bankrupt, you can\u2019t believe it.\u201d  Mr. Musk\u2019s tweet, which doesn\u2019t appear to be in response to the NTSB, was timed for April Fools\u2019 Day and Easter. But it also comes at a particularly sensitive time for Tesla, which is also in a tight cash situation as it tries to ramp up production of its mass-market car, the Model 3.  Tesla is expected to report first-quarter vehicle sales numbers this week, and the market will be carefully examining the company\u2019s guidance on whether or not it can hit its oft-delayed goal, of producing 5,000 Model 3 cars each week, by the end of the second quarter. Analysts say that milestone is an inflection point for Tesla when the company can start generating cash.  Tesla\u2019s shares had surged over the past couple of years on the promise that Mr. Musk could not only deliver an all-electric car for the masses, but also fulfill his vision of creating cars that drive themselves.  Tesla\u2019s disclosure on Friday that the semiautonomous system, called Autopilot, was engaged before the fatal crash near Mountain View, Calif., immediately reignited questions about the technology. A man was killed after his Tesla Model X sport-utility traveling southbound on Highway 101 collided with a barrier and was struck by two other vehicles, according to the California Highway Patrol.  Tesla late Friday said Autopilot was activated in the seconds leading up to the crash. The driver\u2019s hands weren\u2019t detected on the wheel for six seconds before the collision, the company said. Tesla said vehicle logs showed the driver took no action despite having five seconds and about 500 feet of unobstructed view of the concrete highway divider.  On Sunday, the NTSB said it needs Tesla to decode the data recorded by the vehicle. \u201cIn each of our [past] investigations involving a Tesla vehicle, Tesla has been extremely cooperative on assisting with the vehicle data,\u201d an agency spokesman said. \u201cHowever, the NTSB is unhappy with the release of investigative information by Tesla.\u201d  Newsletter Sign-up  The NTSB said it would probe all aspects of the crash, including suggestions the driver had expressed previous concerns about Autopilot. It said it would publish a preliminary report on the investigation, likely within a few weeks of completion of field work.  \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing a thorough search of our service records and we cannot find anything suggesting that the customer ever complained to Tesla about the performance of Autopilot,\u201d Tesla said in a statement. \u201cThere was a concern raised once about navigation not working correctly, but Autopilot\u2019s performance is unrelated to navigation.\u201d  The NTSB probe won\u2019t necessarily lead to sanctions against the electric car company. The NTSB determines probable causes of accidents and makes recommendations to policy makers, but doesn\u2019t issue penalties or take other punitive actions.

The trouble is, raising it suddenly looks a lot more challenging.  Moody\u2019s Investors Service downgraded Tesla\u2019s debt on Tuesday afternoon, citing persistently negative cash flow and continued production issues with the Model 3 mass-market sedan. Moody\u2019s is keeping a negative outlook on the credit due to \u201cthe likelihood that Tesla will have to undertake a large, near-term capital raise in order to refund maturing obligations and avoid a liquidity shortfall.\u201d  Tesla\u2019s bonds due in 2025, issued just last summer, were quoted near 90 cents on the dollar after hours. Meanwhile, the stock is down 23% in about a month, making equity more expensive. There are plenty of reasons that Tesla\u2019s magic touch with the capital markets is fading fast.  For starters, Tesla\u2019s financial statements paint an alarming picture of the group\u2019s long-term viability. Tesla had $3.4 billion in cash and equivalents at the end of the year and raised an additional $550 million from bonds backed by lease payments in February. Not all of that is available for spending. Customer deposits, which are mostly refundable, topped $850 million at last count.  Tesla burned more than $3.4 billion last year in free cash, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures. If that pace were to keep up, Tesla would run out of its usable cash before this year ends. Worse still, there is reason to believe the free cash burn figure was understated.  Tesla booked $666.5 million in upfront payments to install solar-energy systems as an investing cash outflow. That normally would be an operating expense, depressing free cash flow. Tesla also has managed to flatter its operating cash flow picture by stretching its working capital. Accounts payable grew by nearly $530 million in 2017 to about $2.4 billion, while accounts receivable grew by just $15 million. The difference generated more than half a billion in cash. That was a smart move to conserve resources, but the trouble is that eventually these suppliers will demand their money. They won\u2019t be comfortable if Tesla can\u2019t meet its forecast production rate of 2,500 Model 3 cars a week by the end of the first quarter.  Newsletter Sign-up  Production issues are only one part of the Model 3 problem, however. The car doesn\u2019t seem to be in as high demand as Chief Executive Elon Musk once promised investors. Analysts at Bernstein said in a research note last week that fewer than 30% of customers who have been invited to take delivery of the Model 3 have actually done so.  And Tesla can\u2019t simply cut spending to solve its cash challenge if it hopes to ramp up production. The company has racked up about $10 billion in long- term debt and has $23 billion in total liabilities. To survive long term, Tesla needs to stop overpromising and to scale back its ambitions to goals it actually can achieve. Right now, though, it just needs more money.  More debt isn\u2019t a practical solution given the current bondholder losses. An equity raise is still possible, but the recent selloff across the tech sector won\u2019t help\u2014nor will the fact that the reality of the Model 3 has so far proven to be much less attractive than the fantasy of yesteryear.  If next week\u2019s delivery update is worse than feared, the odds of keeping the lights on through this year will get a lot longer.

It was unclear which specific teams inside Amazon were affected. Amazon\u2019s consumer organization includes its retail and marketplace businesses, as well as programs like food delivery service Amazon Restaurants.  Seattle-based Amazon has been on a hiring tear, creating some 130,000 jobs worldwide in 2017 and announcing plans to open a second headquarters in North America, anticipating up to 50,000 more jobs there. Its full-time and part-time headcount surged 66 percent in the fourth quarter to 566,000 from a year earlier. That figure includes employees at Whole Foods Market, which Amazon acquired in a $13.7 billion deal last year.

The mere threat of the online giant getting into the health business prompted the country's two largest pharmacy benefit managers -- CVS Health Corp. and Express Scripts Holding Co. -- to join forces with two of its largest insurers, Aetna Inc. and Cigna Corp. These deals will put more U.S. health care under the control of fewer companies. The merging companies say this will lower costs for consumers and the country. But the reality will likely be less rosy and more complicated.  Looming Amazon is worth $200 billion more than the country's five largest insurers and three largest pharmacy benefit managers -- which will shortly be consolidated into five total companies Source: Bloomberg  That these companies can even make such deals is due partly to the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, which blocked the mergers of Anthem Inc. with Cigna and Aetna with Humana Inc. Those mega-insurers would have been too busy digesting to make big vertical deals and too large to be acquired by other insurers.  UnitedHealth Group Inc. has been another major motivator for these mergers. It successfully pioneered a strategy of aggressive diversification by buying a large PBM in 2015 and with its Optum health-services unit. The gravitational pull of its success -- it leads peers in patient enrollment, revenue growth, and market valuation -- has inspired copycats. Profit pressure on PBMs, meanwhile, likely helped make them receptive to merging with insurers.  Pole Position UnitedHealth has consistently outgrown its rivals in recent years Source: Bloomberg  But Amazon's long shadow also helped instigate these deals. With its technological prowess, long investment horizon, bottomless appetite for new business and tolerance for thin margins, any mention of its interest in health care rattles investors, particularly in the industry's middlemen.  If the deals go through, the result will be an unprecedented level of market concentration.  All three of the biggest U.S. PBMs will be tied to three of the country's biggest insurers. CVS, Express Scripts, and UnitedHealth process more than 70 percent of all U.S. prescriptions. Post-merger, three companies will insure more than 90 million people in some capacity, process more than 3.5 billion prescription claims, and generate more than $500 billion in revenue.  Not every American will have both their medical and drug benefits managed by the same company. But many more will in the years to come. These integrated companies have more information about their customers and more ability and incentive to manage the totality of their health spending.  UnitedHealth is already all-encompassing, with its continuing investment in everything from ambulatory surgery centers to physician groups. CVS and Aetna -- which will add retail pharmacies and primary care clinics to the equation -- could have an unprecedented role in patient lives.  The deal spree may continue. Anthem and Humana look lonely. While Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. focuses on retail pharmacies in the U.S., its main rival's increasing breadth puts it at an uncomfortable disadvantage.  Even if this is the end of the deal-making, the impact of what has already happened will be far-ranging. Drugmakers and providers won't enjoy negotiating with these new giants. As for consumers, drug and provider options may narrow. Aetna and CVS will want to drive people to its own clinics, as UnitedHealth already does with its own provider network.  And PBMs are more effective and profitable when more people use tightly controlled drug plans; enrollees at newly affiliated insurers may find their drug choices are more restricted. The more people PBMs can push toward or away from a given medicine, the more negotiating leverage they have with drug manufacturers.  The merging companies have claimed huge cost savings will flow to consumers from these deals, but I'm skeptical. Research suggests costs can actually end up rising in some cases of health-care consolidation. Less competition means more pricing power for the companies that remain. Markets with more insurers have lower premiums, while prices rise when hospitals buy physician groups. Though these are vertical deals, they will add to the market power of major players in already heavily consolidated industries, which seems like a recipe for monopolistic behavior.  True, reducing the number of middlemen who get a taste of nearly every transaction should theoretically cut costs. And these giants will be able to compel larger discounts from drugmakers and providers. But it would be a rather large deviation from standard capitalist practice if these conglomerates don't capture most of those savings for shareholders.  The newly merged companies will have debt to pay off and must prove to investors the deals were smart. That likely won't leave much in the way of cost savings for the average customer  Amazon and its partners say they hope to create a new and better health-care system, free of the profit motive, for their employees. But the unintended consequences of their interest in the sector will impact a far larger group of Americans much sooner.

From 2013 to 2016, the USPS averaged a net loss of $5.3 billion per year. The reasons behind those losses, though, are more complicated than the way Trump seems to see it. According to the president, the financial woes of the Postal Service have much to do with the deal it has with Amazon.com to deliver the internet retailer\u2019s packages.  Leaving aside Trump\u2019s claims about the Postal Service\u2019s deal with Amazon (which is not a money loser) and his probable reasons for treating it like a pi\u00f1ata (he\u2019s no fan of Amazon Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos, who also happens to be the owner of the Washington Post, a leading chronicler of this administration\u2019s foibles) the president is right to be concerned with the state of the USPS. The question is whether Trump actually wants to fix the agency or simply tweet about it. If he wants to fix it, there are a number of things he could do.  For starters, he could support a group of U.S. senators with a set of postal reform proposals that could return the agency to solvency. In late March, Senator Tom Carper (D-Del.), introduced a bill with a bipartisan co-sponsorship that would move retired postal workers into Medicare, eliminating the agency\u2019s unfunded health-care liabilities and its need to set aside huge sums to cover them. Naturally, some congressional deficit hawks have complained that this would just shift these costs from one side of the federal ledger to the other. Yet the USPS, the second-largest contributor to Medicare after the federal government, has said such a plan would only raise the government\u2019s annual Medicare costs by a 10th of 1 percent.  Ten Years of Losses Net loss, U.S. Postal Service Data: USPS; graphic by Bloomberg Businessweek  The Senate bill, introduced March 22, would also restore half of the 4.3 percent emergency rate increase on items like first-class mail that the Postal Regulatory Commission granted the agency in 2013 only to revoke it three years later. It didn\u2019t matter that first-class mail continued its inexorable decline as more people used email and pay their bills online. The result was a decline in American stamp prices, already among the lowest in the developed world, from 49 cents to 47 cents, which only added to the losses at the USPS.  These are worthy ideas, endorsed with rare unanimity by USPS management, postal worker unions, and many of the institution\u2019s largest customers. Without White House support, however, the Senate bill is likely to wither and die, a fate suffered by other promising reform proposals in recent years. The tragedy isn\u2019t that Trump has yet to express any interest in pushing such ideas, it\u2019s that he appears not to understand how the agency actually functions.  As reported by Bloomberg News, Trump expressed a desire to aides last summer to raise the Postal Service\u2019s rates for delivering Amazon packages. According to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity, Trump\u2019s staff explained to him that the Postal Service is an independent organization and its mail rates are set by a commission.  American presidents have a history of getting involved in matters postal, usually for the better. In 1792, George Washington signed the country\u2019s first postal act, which included lower rates for newspapers in an effort to create an informed citizenry. It was so effective that French political philosopher Alexis De Tocqueville praised the American postal system as \u201cthe great link between minds\u201d when he visited the country in 1831. Trump\u2019s idol Andrew Jackson was so enamored with the Postal Service that he moved it into the president\u2019s cabinet after he was elected in 1828 and stuffed it with his political supporters, a practice that continued for more than a century.  Montgomery Blair, Abraham Lincoln\u2019s postmaster general, introduced free home delivery in cities at a time when most people had to endure long lines at the post office to get their letters. Under Woodrow Wilson, the Postal Service introduced airmail in 1918, clearing the runway for the commercial aviation industry. Richard Nixon signed a bill in 1970 removing the USPS from the president\u2019s cabinet in an effort to remove it from the political hurly-burly and give it the nimbleness of a private company. Unfortunately, it was still subject to heavy-handed congressional and regulatory oversight and often struggled to break even.  In 2006, President George W. Bush signed a bill giving the USPS long overdue power to negotiate package shipping deals like the Amazon one. Unfortunately, the bill required the USPS to set aside $5 billion a year to prefund the health benefits of its future retirees. It wasn\u2019t long before the Great Recession arrived, causing mail volume to plummet.  Decline in Volume of All Mail Number of pieces Data: USPS; graphic by Bloomberg Businessweek  The financial burdens that the Bush administration imposed were clearly untenable. Yet Bush\u2019s successor Barack Obama did virtually nothing to alleviate the situation. During his 2008 presidential campaign, Obama quipped, \u201cUPS and FedEx are doing fine. It\u2019s the post office that\u2019s always having problems.\u201d Postal workers understandably took issue with his remark. Once Obama was in the White House, his administration quietly supported the USPS\u2019s plan to end Saturday delivery, which would have saved $2 billion a year. It died in Congress because it was vociferously opposed by postal workers unions and congressional representatives from rural areas who said their constituents depended on traditional mail delivery. Meanwhile, the USPS\u2019s losses mounted, and it was forced to cut hours at rural post offices and slow first-class mail delivery in a vain attempt to make ends meet.  Presidents no longer have the control over the Postal Service that they did in Jackson or Wilson\u2019s day. Today, they get to appoint its board of governors. That\u2019s about it for their formal powers, but they can use the bully pulpit to push for change. That\u2019s what Trump is attempting to do now on Twitter in his criticisms of Amazon and the USPS. The problem is that he\u2019s focused on the wrong issues. He returned to Twitter on April 2, recycling an argument made last year by Citigroup analysts who argued that, properly accounted for, the USPS was losing an average of $1.50 on every Amazon package.  It\u2019s a complicated, legalistic case based on the presumption that the USPS, which declines to disclose the agreement\u2019s terms, is essentially providing Amazon a free ride on its letter delivery network rather than requiring it to pay the full costs of the service. That notion excites people at UPS and FedEx and their investors, but few others seem to take it seriously. (The conservative Wall Street Journal editorial page, a frequent critic of the USPS, shrugged it off on Tuesday.)  The reality is that the USPS needs more customers like Amazon, not fewer. It\u2019s required by law to visit every address in the country six days a week regardless of how many bills, greeting cards, and catalogs its letter carriers lug in their sacks. With first-class mail and the junkier kind disappearing, the USPS needs something else to put through the network to make money. Postal workers have a saying: \u201cThe internet giveth, and the internet taketh away,\u201d which is to say the agency\u2019s future lies in online shopping. Amazon is the first retailer to integrate its distribution system into the Postal Service\u2019s network, constructing sorting centers around the country to funnel packages to local post offices so letter carriers can tote them to people\u2019s doors. As e-commerce continues to account for more of what Americans spend, it provides a potential path to a healthier financial future for the USPS.  This vision of the agency\u2019s future is something a shrewd president might champion, but it would require Trump to stop making dubious claims about the reasons for the Postal Service\u2019s financial difficulties. He might even admit that he\u2019s been wrong about the Amazon deal. Unfortunately, that\u2019s not Trump\u2019s style.

To be the first to know, please click here.  Amazon has been attempting to curb losses on shipping orders of low-priced items by raising shipping fees for consumer goods suppliers, Bloomberg reports.  The e-commerce giant deducts transport costs \u2014 or the cost of moving a supplier's inventory through its distribution network \u2014 from payments for bulk orders from suppliers.  But, as its shipping costs have dramatically increased over the years, Amazon is looking to shift these costs more to its suppliers, and specifically target low-cost items that are heavy and expensive to ship, like beverages and diapers.  Additionally, the e-commerce giant is planning to make it more difficult for shoppers to purchase single, low-priced items, such as toothbrushes or soap, to encourage them to add these items into a larger purchase. Some personal care and health items on Amazon are already restricted as \"add-ons,\" or items that can only be purchased with a basket size of $25 or more. However, the company is planning on designating more items as \"add-ons\" by expanding the category to include health and beauty products that cost less than $7.  Amazon is looking to curb costs because its shipping costs are skyrocketing. Although Amazon has been working to optimize its fulfillment network through various initiatives, like extending order cut-off times to eliminate split shipments, its shipping costs are still growing in the double digits. Shipping costs reached nearly $20 billion in 2017 for the e-commerce titan, growing 31% year-over-year (YoY) in Q4 alone. As Amazon looks to grow its Prime Now, one-hour, and two-hour delivery services, while keeping its reputation for free and fast shipping on all orders, its move to improve profitability on consumer goods products is a sensible one.  The retail giant is following Walmart's move to aim for profitability in shipping online orders. Walmart has already raised prices for some online goods, and recently began to push suppliers to offer more high-priced goods on its e-commerce site. Although these two companies have been in a grid-lock price war, it seems like they've come to a tipping point in terms of shipping costs.  However, each company's approach has different pros and cons, making it unclear which one will be more successful in optimizing online revenues while minimizing shipping costs.", "stock": "AMZN", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-23", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-aims-to-improve-shipping-profitability-2018-3"}, {"article": "Amazon is famous for its aggressive growth.

Getty/Stephen Brashear  Amazon Go is Amazon's futuristic store that uses cameras and sensors to charge customers for what they take from shelves.  Loup Ventures' Andrew Murphy thinks that Amazon will license the tech for other stores.  In this way, Amazon would have a \"Trojan horse\" into traditional brick-and-mortar retail.  Amazon may be going in another direction with its \"just-walk-out\" technology.  According to a new bit of analysis from Loup Ventures' Andrew Murphy, Amazon could leverage the technology in Amazon Go \u2014 the company's futuristic store that uses sensors, not cashiers, to correctly charge customers for what they take \u2014 in a different way than anticipated.  Instead of simply opening more Amazon Go stores, he thinks the company will instead license the technology to other retailers, which would give Amazon a \"Trojan horse into the brick and mortar retail space.\"  In this way, it would be similar to the infrastructure Amazon built with its cloud-computing platform, AWS, and its third-party marketplace offering, Fulfillment by Amazon.  Amazon is clearly interested in moving into the brick-and-mortar space, and the technology in Amazon Go could be \"a turnkey solution for automated retail,\" Murphy said.  This probably doesn't mean you're going to see the tech in general merchandise competitors like Walmart or Target, but specialty retailers, like Nike, that already sell their goods on Amazon could look to add it to their growing retail presence. It could save on labor costs, or ensure workers focus on customer service instead of rote jobs like cashing out customers.  The race to automate cashiers' jobs as Amazon Go does has the company in the \"pole position\" to cash in on what Murphy says is a $50 billion opportunity for retailers.  The technology could be a strong driver to bring more brands into the fold as the company courts more and higher-end brands to work with.  Amazon partnered with Calvin Klein over the holidays, using its Echo smart speakers in fitting rooms to answer customers' questions or change the lighting.

Amazon's checkout-free grocery store opens in Seattle on Monday.

The store, called Amazon Go, doesn't work like a typical Walmart or supermarket \u2014 instead, it's designed so that shoppers will use an app, also called Amazon Go, to automatically add the products they plan to buy to a digital shopping cart; they can then walk out of the building without waiting in a checkout line.  The store opening Monday is 1,800 square feet, according to Reuters, and it's located in an Amazon office building.  The idea is that Amazon's machine-learning technology can automatically identify when a product is added to your cart, so you don't have to do it yourself. When you leave the store, Amazon automatically charges your Amazon account.  The stores will sell ready-made food, staples like bread and milk, and other grocery products.

To be the first to know, please click here.  Amid President Donald Trump's ongoing public feud with Amazon, CNBC reports that the e-commerce behemoth has been fighting with UPS for the past few years.  The argument seems to be over the United States Postal Service's (USPS) cost structure, which has a direct impact on Amazon, its largest and most highly publicized customer, as well as UPS, which has struggled to lower its prices to match USPS' rates. Amazon's relationship with USPS directly affects the competitive landscape of parcel deliveries in the US, a market in which UPS and FedEx are the dominant players.  The dispute stems from how USPS splits up its fixed costs \u2014 including driver salaries, trucking fees, and other overhead expenses \u2014 between its two business segments. The two units are its letter business, a government-protected monopoly, and the competitive parcel business, which competes with UPS, FedEx, and other parcel delivery companies.  Under the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006, USPS is currently required to cover at least 5.5% of its fixed costs with revenue from its competitive business. Competing logistics providers, however, argue that this low-cost coverage requirement is outdated because of the explosive growth in e-commerce over the last few years \u2014 the competitive business now accounts for 30% of USPS' total revenue, up from only 11% a decade ago.  Last year, UPS argued in a filing with the Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC) that the law gave the postal service an unfair competitive advantage. That's because USPS can cover a large portion of its costs with its letter business, and therefore offer lower prices than other logistics companies.  Amazon routes the majority of its deliveries through USPS as a result of these lower rates, meaning UPS and other logistics providers are losing out on a plethora of business. Moreover, the e-tailer has argued for keeping the requirement as is, saying that a higher minimum would provide no benefits to stakeholders and isn't necessary to create a level playing field. UPS argued in its filing that the postal service's competitive business should cover a much larger share of its fixed costs, somewhere around 29%.  Tensions between the e-commerce titan and logistics companies will only intensify as Amazon moves further into the logistics market over the next few years.Amazon's well-publicized ambitions in the logistics space have grown more intense over the last few months, and will likely only continue to become more serious. It launched Fulfillment by Amazon, which allows third-party sellers to store and ship some of their products in the online retailer's proprietary logistics network, way back in 2006, and it now serves millions of retailers around the world.  Last year, the company started trialing Seller Flex in several locations on the West Coast, which took over management of its third-party sellers' deliveries to speed up delivery times and lower costs, and last month, The Wall Street Journal reported that the company is preparing to launch a stand-alone shipping service for any retailer. Amazon still has a long way to go before it even comes close to posing a direct threat to UPS, FedEx, and DHL, but as it continues to make inroads into the logistics space, it's likely that the company will only further inflame these existing tensions.", "stock": "AMZN", "label": 1, "date": "2018-04-09", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-and-ups-were-feuding-before-trump-2018-4"}, {"article": "Amazon is gearing up to compete directly with UPS and FedEx, according to a new Wall Street Journal report.

After its initial launch in LA, Amazon will look to expand it out to other cities, possibly as soon as later this year, the WSJ says.

This should not be surprising to anyone following Amazon\u2019s moves on the logistics front \u2013 the retail giant has its own fleet of cargo jets, its own warehouses, its own last-mile contract couriers and can even act as an ocean shipping agent, just like both FedEx and UPS.

And, its camera is surprisingly good for a phone of this price.  $179 for Prime members  LG X Charge  Huge 4,500mAh battery  Expandable storage via microSD  No fingerprint sensor  Only 720p display  The LG X Charge is a no-frills budget option for smartphone shoppers that want a phone that can do most of what a smartphone is expected to do nowadays. But, there's a bonus, and that's the insane 4,500mAh battery packed inside the phone, which should be enough to keep the LG X Charge powered for even the busiest days.  $149 for Prime members  Motorola Moto E4  Broad carrier compatibility  Water resistance  Not an octa-core  US model lacks all-metal construction  Motorola has been producing a lot of quality budget phones. The Moto E series is its more affordable line of phones, and the Moto E4 is a good phone for the price. At under $100, it comes running Android 7.1 Nougat, boasts a Snapdragon 425 with 1.4GHz quad-core processor and 2GB of RAM, and comes with a fingerprint scanner. It\u2019s even water resistant. It offers a lot at this price point, and is compatible with all four major mobile networks right out of the box.  $96 used with Amazon Prime  Nokia 6  Quality metal build  Full HD display  Questionable performance  The Nokia 6 is another premium feeling smartphone on a budget price. It has a solid aluminum build around the sides and back and houses a 5.5-inch Full HD display. It also includes a fingerprint scanner with capacitive navigation buttons on either side, freeing up some of the screen real estate. Inside it packs a Snapdragon 430 chipset with 1.4GHz octa-core processor and 3GB of RAM. 32GB of internal storage make it decent to begin with, but it can be expanded with up to 128GB of MicroSD storage. The Nokia 6 is impressive for the price.  $179 with Amazon Prime  Motorola Moto G5 Plus  Design and build quality  Fast fingerprint scanner  No NFC  Non-removable battery  The Moto G5 Plus has a lot to offer. It\u2019s a capable phone with a premium design that leaves it feeling like a more expensive phone. Its fingerprint scanner keeps it up with the times, and its compatibility with all four major US carriers gives customers the freedom to choose. It packs a 2.0GHz octa-core processor, 2GB of RAM, 32GB of expandable storage, a 12MP camera and 5MP selfie cam, and it even features Motorola\u2019s TurboPower quick-charging ability.

Amazon.com Inc. AMZN -1.22% has accounted for 27% of the broader index\u2019s 1.6% gain through Tuesday, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices\u2019 data. That is followed by Microsoft Corp. MSFT -0.53% , which has contributed 13%, and Netflix Inc. at 8.3%. U.S. stocks fell Wednesday, but Amazon and Netflix extended their 2018 gains, adding to their dominance over the S&P 500.  \u201cWhen you see a Netflix or Amazon leading, it\u2019s not necessarily a great sign of investor confidence, since you know those names can always deliver growth no matter what\u2019s going on,\u201d said Jack Ablin, founding partner and chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors.  Investors have fretted in recent years about the dominance of a single sector or stock in the market, but those fears have generally proved unfounded. Markets continued marching higher even after shares of Apple Inc., which was a driver of the rally, stalled for part of 2016.  The S&P 500 technology sector has driven more than three quarters of the index\u2019s gains, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. The next biggest contributor is the consumer-discretionary sector\u2014which includes tech-focused Amazon and Netflix\u2014with more than a third of the advance.  To some investors, the continued outperformance of technology-oriented companies is surprising. After the tech sector jumped 37% in 2017, nearly doubling the broader S&P 500\u2019s advance, many investors expected the rally to stall or be overtaken by other sectors.  Among those expected to gain were cyclical stocks like commodity producers, manufacturers and banks whose businesses tend to improve as the economy strengthens and prices rise.  Instead, energy shares have extended their rout, even as U.S. crude prices have bounced off their 2014 lows. Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. have together chipped away about 12% from the S&P 500\u2019s year-to-date advance. And industrial firms, which soared after the 2016 presidential election on bets that the Trump administration would pump up infrastructure spending, have lagged behind the S&P 500, as some investors have questioned how the administration will secure funding for its plan.  Other investors predicted bank shares would begin outperforming the broader market again after the passage of the Republican tax overhaul. And those companies have seen a boost: JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp. together have made up 12% of the S&P 500\u2019s 2018 gains, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.  Yet enthusiasm for technology stocks hasn\u2019t tapered off. Roughly a third of global fund managers say they are overweight technology stocks in their portfolios, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey conducted at the start of the month. That was the highest share of overweights of all 11 S&P 500 sectors.  Tech\u2019s dominance has helped the Nasdaq Composite, which heavily weights shares of technology companies, outperform other indexes so far this year.

REUTERS/Chris Helgren/File Photo  Barclays cited a handful of reasons for moving the stock to \u201coverweight\u201d from \u201cunderweight\u201d, saying the company could emerge as the next important cloud vendor after Amazon and Microsoft.

Up to Tuesday\u2019s close, they have gained nearly 12 percent since its last quarterly results on Oct. 17.  To counter a slowdown in its legacy hardware and software businesses, IBM has been shifting focus steadily towards data analytics and cloud computing services.  The cloud market is currently dominated by Amazon Web Services and Microsoft\u2019s Azure unit - both of which have been growing in double digits as customers scale up their Internet presence.  \u201cThere is room for another cloud player,\u201d Barclays analyst Mark Moskowitz wrote in a note titled \u201cIBM - A New Dawn Emerges\u201d and raised his price target on the stock to $192 from $133.  The company, which will report after U.S. markets close on Thursday, trumped Wall Street\u2019s estimates for both profit and revenue in the third quarter ended Sept. 30.  While total revenue in that quarter fell 0.4 percent, the 22nd straight quarterly fall, it was also the smallest quarterly drop since the third quarter of 2016.  Moskowitz said IBM\u2019s revenue may prove stable or even grow over the next 12-18 months.  He also argued that recently disclosed Spectre and Meltdown processor security flaws could allow IBM to gain share in the mid-range and high-end server market.  IBM last month launched Power9 processors, designed for cloud computing and machine learning, to better compete with the likes of Intel and Advanced Micro Devices Inc.  A fix for Meltdown, which only affects Intel chips, could lower performance by 30 percent in some cases, pushing customers to look for new processors, potentially lifting both IBM\u2019s market share and revenue, Moskowitz wrote.  In a blog post dated Jan. 15, IBM said firmware patches for Power9 platforms were available to fix the security flaws.

Revenue in the newer businesses \u201cmissed whisper expectations,\u201d which disappointed the most bullish scenarios, he said.  IBM reported fourth-quarter sales of $11.1 billion in \u201cstrategic imperatives\u201d -- those newer products and services in cloud, analytics, security and mobile. While that was up 17 percent from a year earlier, it was just in line with the average estimate and many were hoping for more, Ives said.  IBM shares were down 3.3 percent at 7:16 a.m. in pre-market trading in New York Friday.  Much of the growth fueling IBM\u2019s $22.5 billion in fourth-quarter revenue came from its new mainframe servers. Customers from banks to health-care companies are buying the hardware and accompanying software for their own data centers to run large applications -- from financial transactions to customer billing. That should help keep pumping up revenue over the next couple of quarters, analysts said. But IBM will have to show that gains in its newer software and services will help it keep growing even when the bump from hardware sales fades.  \u201cIt\u2019s possible that organic growth may be back to flat in the second half of this year, once the benefit from the mainframe refresh cycle goes away,\u201d said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Anurag Rana. \u201cIf you exclude the contribution from mainframes, growth would be flat to negative, which is in line with the past few quarters.\u201d  Sales, which increased 3.6 percent in the period, topped the average analyst estimate of $22.06 billion. International Business Machines Corp. had forecast the growth in October. IBM said it took a one-time charge of $5.5 billion as a result of the new U.S. tax law, which weighed on profit. In addition, the company said it expects its tax rate to rise in 2018 as a result of the bill, which includes a lower corporate tax rate offset by a broader tax base and reduced foreign tax credit utilization.  Tax Headwinds  The tax headwinds, combined with the one-time charge, threw \u201cone big wrench in the wheel\u201d and could also be why investors are reacting negatively, said David Holt, an analyst at CFRA Research.  Profit, excluding some items, was $5.18 a share in the quarter. Analysts projected $5.17. IBM fell 1 cent short of the average analyst estimate of $13.81 a share for the full year. Under generally accepted accounting principles, IBM reported a loss for the quarter including the tax charge. The shares fell as much as 4.8 percent to $161 in extended trading.  Over the last six years, Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty assured investors that she would refocus IBM\u2019s business on emerging technologies -- such as cloud and artificial intelligence -- and stem the revenue decline. She shed units, invested in cloud data centers and bought a number of companies to boost sales, bolster technology offerings and add troves of data to help train AI algorithms. But those investments have yet to pay off, and analysts have said that IBM\u2019s turnaround is still in the works.  The shares took a beating last year, after the company missed sales estimates in the first half. The stock then rallied the most since 2009 after the company forecast revenue would increase in the fourth quarter. Analysts have said that shows investors care most about getting back to sales growth. One quarter of expansion doesn\u2019t a successful turnaround make, and it\u2019s now critical for IBM to sustain improving revenue this year.  \u201cRevenue growth has been what investors have been wanting to see,\u201d Holt said. \u201cWhen you pull back the layers, all the segments are churning, and fundamentals are pointing in the right direction.\u201d  The company projected revenue growth in 2018, regardless of currency trends. New Chief Financial Officer Jim Kavanaugh said that will be achieved in part by gains in software-as-a-service as well as IBM\u2019s global business services operations -- an area that has struggled in recent years.  Strategic Imperatives Goal  Rometty had set a goal for IBM to reach $40 billion in strategic imperative revenue this year, which would mean those newer products would make up more than half of the company\u2019s business. Kavanaugh said the company will achieve that goal and continue to increase strategic imperative sales at least at a percentage in the the double digits.  Should IBM increase revenue in global business services as promised by the end of the year, that would reverse continuous declines of more than a year, Holt said. This is an area IBM has invested heavily in to shift the focus and skills of its employees onto projects in digital and cloud-based technologies.  Gross margins were 49.5 percent, missing the average analyst estimate of 50.9 percent, in part because measures to cut expenses took longer to pay off, the company said. While margins improved sequentially as promised, this is the ninth straight quarter that they shrank compared with the same period the prior year. Gross margins will stabilize this year, helped by the expense cutting, higher sales in more profitable products and increased scale on the cloud business, Kavanaugh said. However, currency hedges and plans to continue investing will offset some of that benefit, he said.  Revenue from the systems unit, which houses hardware and operating systems software, grew 32 percent. Typically an area of decline, sales of mainframe servers, as well as accompanying software, helped boost the group.  Sales in the cognitive solutions unit, which houses analytics software and the AI products branded under Watson, grew 2.5 percent to $5.4 billion. Technology services and cloud platforms, the unit that includes IBM\u2019s cloud infrastructure and platform offerings as well as its consulting business, posted a revenue decline of 1.2 percent, in part because some of its legacy software sales with bigger upfront revenue shifted to the cloud.  Last week, IBM named Kavanaugh to be the new CFO, while Martin Schroeter will be taking on a new role as the senior vice president of global markets.

The group signed a charter Friday at a security conference in Munich urging stronger safeguards against assaults on digital systems that control homes, hospitals, factories and nearly all infrastructure. The charter aims to set a standard for companies to find trustworthy business partners, or avoid those outside that circle, Siemens Chief Executive Officer Joe Kaeser said.  \u201cIf companies along the value chain share their experiences, then we can prevent a lot of things,\u201d said Kaeser, who helped initiate the charter. Conversely, \u201cif you haven\u2019t established a certain set of elements, then you\u2019re not part of the it. There has to be a unified approach.\u201d  The initiative comes amid an ongoing investigation in the U.S. into allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 election, and after computer malware has already shown its ability to spread through systems worldwide. Last year\u2019s WannaCry ransomware crippled parts of Britain\u2019s National Health Service and infected more than 300,000 computers across 150 countries. The cost of cyber-crime to firms over the next five years could reach $8 trillion, the World Economic Forum said in a report in January.  Signatories of the Munich charter, which also include Allianz AG, Daimler AG, NXP Semiconductors NV, SGS SA and Deutsche Telekom AG, are calling for governments and companies to take responsibility for digital security at the highest levels. They suggest governments set up dedicated ministries devoted to the issue.  Societal Breakdown    Airbus CEO Tom Enders said his company now employs about 1,000 people dealing with a response to cyber attacks, a number he estimates will rise tenfold or more in the next decade, highlighting how the issue is becoming an increasingly central part of large companies\u2019 organisation. New-generation aircraft contain tens of thousands of sensors and are increasingly connected via mobile networks, making the storage and securing of data increasingly complex, he said.  Still, most of of the security breaches that are disclosed via government agencies to companies typically come from the either the U.S. or the U.K., evidence that other European political institutions must do more to collaborate with companies, Enders said.  \u201cWe must not be afraid to share information freely between governments, government agencies and industries,\u201d Enders said.  Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said the issue \u201c\u2018will certainly be a focus\u201d of the country\u2019s Group of Seven presidency this year.

Companies use blockchain and other so-called digital ledgers to securely record transactions and process other data over the internet -- a service Google could use, for example, to reassure customers that their information is protected when stored on the giant network of computer servers that power its cloud services.  The Alphabet Inc. unit is developing its own distributed digital ledger that third parties can use to post and verify transactions, one of the people said. Although the timing of any product release is unclear, the company plans to offer this to differentiate its cloud service from rivals. It will also provide a white-label version that other companies can run on their own servers, the person added.  The internet giant has also been acquiring and investing in startups with digital ledger expertise. Many of the deals haven\u2019t been announced, the person said. Still, Alphabet was a leading corporate investor in the field last year, ahead of Citigroup Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., according to research firm CB Insights.  Several people in Google\u2019s infrastructure group, which reports to cloud chief Diane Greene, have been tinkering with blockchain protocols in recent months, according to another person familiar with the company. Other Google insiders said recently that the cloud business is a natural place for blockchain-related services. The people asked not to be identified talking about the subject because the company isn\u2019t ready to make an announcement yet.  \u201cLike many new technologies, we have individuals in various teams exploring potential uses of blockchain but it\u2019s way too early for us to speculate about any possible uses or plans,\u201d a Google spokesman said.  In 2016, Google started a trial for developers testing blockchain services on its cloud. The company is now exploring much more expansive ways to deploy the technology, the people said.  Digital ledgers like blockchain power Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. They are databases that are updated regularly across thousands of computers over the internet. Each entry is confirmed by these machines, which can be part of public networks or run privately by companies. There are different kinds of digital ledgers -- blockchain is only one. Data crunched by this technology range from transactions to supply-chain updates to digital cats.  The technology presents challenges and opportunities for Google. Distributed networks of computers that run digital ledgers can eliminate risks that come with information held centrally by a single company. While Google\u2019s security is strong, it\u2019s one of the largest holders of information in the world. The decentralized approach is also beginning to support new online services that compete with Google.  Still, the company is an internet pioneer and has long experience embracing new and open web standards. To build its ledger, Google has looked at technology from the Hyperledger consortium, but it could opt for another type that may be easier to scale to run millions of transactions, one of the people familiar with the situation said.  \"Any time there\u2019s a paradigm shift like this, there\u2019s an opportunity for new giants to emerge -- but also for incumbents to adopt the new approach,\" said Elad Gil, a startup investor who worked on early mobile projects at Google more than a decade ago.  Sridhar Ramaswamy, Google\u2019s advertising chief, said at a recent conference that his division has a \"small team\" looking at blockchain, but noted the existing core technology can\u2019t handle a lot of transactions quickly. Some marketing firms have started to explore blockchain\u2019s potential to facilitate digital ad buying without using Google and Facebook Inc., the two dominant industry players.  When Alphabet wants to keep up with emerging technology, it often backs startups in the field and makes small acquisitions to recruit talent. GV, Alphabet\u2019s venture capital arm, has invested in wallet service Blockchain Luxembourg, financial transactions network Ripple, cryptocurrency asset management platform LedgerX, international payments provider Veem and the now-defunct Buttercoin, according to CB Insights.  Global Blockchain Spending IBM, Microsoft benefit the most from distributed ledger technology Source: WinterGreen Research Inc.  Among tech giants, IBM and Microsoft Corp. have so far led the charge in offering blockchain-related tools and letting companies tinker with digital ledgers using their cloud services. The market for blockchain products and services may grow from $706 million last year to more than $60 billion in 2024, according to WinterGreen Research. Cloud\u2019s 800-pound gorilla, Amazon.com Inc., helps companies build blockchain applications, and Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg is looking at cryptocurrencies, encryption and other decentralized computing approaches.  A slew of startups are trying to challenge Google\u2019s online dominance by using digital ledgers. Brave is a web browser that competes with Google\u2019s Chrome. Instead of running targeted ads, Brave uses blockchain technology to pay websites when people spend time there. BitClave lets people perform searches online, and get rewarded for seeing ads. Another project, Presearch, is also using blockchain to try to compete with Google\u2019s search engine, according to a white paper by the startup.  \"You\u2019re going to see an unbelievable amount of R&D expenditures go into this,\" said Jeff Richards, a managing partner at venture firm GGV Capital. \"Everybody learned from the internet and mobile that you can\u2019t afford to wait.\"  \u2014 With assistance by Joe Mayes", "stock": "IBM", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-21", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-21/google-is-said-to-work-on-its-own-blockchain-related-technology"}, {"article": "As the U.S. and China threaten to impose tariffs on goods from aluminum to wine, the two nations are waging a separate economic battle that could determine who owns the next wave of computing.

U.S.-funded research in quantum is about $200 million a year, according to a July 2016 government report, and some researchers and companies don\u2019t believe that\u2019s enough.  Quantifying Quantum Computing U.S. and Chinese are in an arms race to patent innovations in computing's next wave Source: Patinformatics  One \u201ckiller app\u201d may be encryption, the code scrambling technology that secures modern global commerce and communications. China, Chinese universities and western financial institutions are rushing to patent more ways to use quantum technology for encryption, a study by research firm Patinformatics found.  \u2018Unhackable System\u2019  \u201cWe\u2019re talking about encrypting data so it can\u2019t be broken, certainly not by a classical computer,\u201d said Tony Trippe, managing director of Dublin, Ohio-based Patinformatics. \u201cIt would be an unhackable system.\u201d  At the same time, it could break encryption that was on a classical computer. \u201cAn organization or a nation that had quantum computer technologies would have a significantly easier time of wreaking havoc on other systems,\u201d he said.  What\u2019s Intellectual Property and Does China Steal It?: QuickTake  U.S. President Donald Trump accused the Chinese government in March of stealing intellectual property by forcing American companies to share their most valuable secrets and sign joint venture agreements with local firms if they want to operate in China, although there are no specific allegations regarding quantum computers.  Peter Navarro, the White House trade adviser, spoke Sunday on NBC\u2019s \"Meet the Press\" about the tariffs before shifting to intellectual property.  \"What is at stake here,\" he said, \"is the industries of the future. Artificial intelligence, robotics, quantum computing. And what\u2019s at stake is not just our economic prosperity. If I may, it\u2019s also our national security. Because many of these industries of the future have profound military implications.\"  China\u2019s Innovation  China has also been aggressive in pushing home-grown innovation as it supports companies in obtaining patents and trademarks around the world, and has increased its research funding. In its annual scorecard, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development called China \u201cthe second largest scientific powerhouse,\u201d behind the U.S.  Read More: Who Is Building Canada\u2019s Quantum Brain Trust?  Technology companies from Microsoft to IBM to Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google view quantum computing as the next revolution.  \u201cOver time, quantum in the field of computation is so important is that it will redefine the category of computers themselves,\u201d said Dario Gil, vice president of IBM\u2019s Artificial Intelligence research. \u201cIt is the future of computing.\u201d  IBM\u2019s inventions may be having the most impact on the nascent field, when judged by the number of times its research has been cited by others in their patent applications. The Armonk, New York-based company already has developed computers being tested by customers, including Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, the Energy Department\u2019s biggest lab, as well as finance companies like JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Barclays Plc, Gil said.  \u2018Tough Problems\u2019  Intel Corp., which started its own program two years ago, said the technology promises to be \u201ctransformational.\u201d  \u201cThere are many tough problems to solve before quantum computing is a commercial reality,\u201d said Jim Clarke, director of quantum hardware at Intel. \u201cSome of these problems involve materials science, quantum chip design and manufacturing -- those are sweet-spot problems for Intel.\u201d  Clarke said Intel is competitive in the number of patents it\u2019s seeking, though many aren\u2019t yet public. Applications are made public after 18 months.  IBM Makes Breakthrough in Race to Commercialize Quantum Computers  While there will still be a place for what\u2019s being called \u201cclassical computers\u201d -- a category that includes modern smartphones and even super computers -- the quantum computers could have \u201can infinite number of applications\u201d in the fields of life sciences, chemistry and agriculture, said IBM\u2019s Gil.  \u2018Patent the Potential\u2019  It\u2019s too early to say which company or country will be the leader in quantum computers, though at this stage it looks like U.S. companies will excel in hardware while Chinese and Japanese ones are focused on the software and applications, Patinformatics\u2019 Trippe said.  \u201cJapanese and Chinese companies aren\u2019t as concerned about building them as they are about how they\u2019ll be used,\u201d Trippe said. \u201cThey\u2019ve started to patent the potential. The next five years are going to be pretty fascinating.\u201d  The U.S. China Economic and Security Review Commission, created by Congress in 2000 to assess national security implications of bilateral trade between the countries, said in its most recent report that China \u201chas closed the technological gap\u201d with the U.S. in quantum information science, a sector Americans have long dominated, \u201cdue to a concerted strategy by the Chinese government and inconsistent and unstable levels of R&D funding and limited government coordination by the United States.\u201d  Quantum Physics  Studies by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Bloomberg have independently shown that China is rising in its overall score for innovation, which includes education, government research and the number of patents. The World Intellectual Property Organization reported March 21 that China is closing in on the U.S. in filing international patent applications.  Quantum physics is one area in which the Chinese government, through its Ministry of Science and Technology, is beefing up its technological prowess, according to a report by the U.S. Trade Representative that laid the groundwork for Trump\u2019s tariff plans. The China Academy of Sciences and Beijing University are among the Chinese research firms seeking more patents on quantum information technology, according to Patinformatics.  The Chinese government invested by giving a lot of money to companies and researchers to \u201creplicate what we did in the U.S. and elsewhere,\u201d said Carl J. Williams, deputy director of the Physical Measurement Laboratory at the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology. \u201cThey\u2019ve come a long ways.\u201d  Encryption Focus  The Chinese researchers are focused on encryption, based on their patent applications. In August 2016, China\u2019s state news agency said the government had launched the world\u2019s first quantum communications satellite, and a year later claimed to have sent the first \u201cunbreakable\u201d code from space.  \u201cThat should be very scary,\u201d said Jonathan Dowling, co-director of Louisiana State University\u2019s Hearne Institute for Theoretical Physics, \u201cat least to the intelligence agencies.\u201d  In the U.S., the Department of Energy, Naval Research Lab and defense contractor Northrop Grumman Corp. are among the government entities or contractors researching quantum computers. Overall, though, the U.S. government has cut back on its own funding of computing and cryptography hardware, Dowling said.  \u2018Considered a Priority\u2019  A July 2016 report by the National Science and Technology Council under former President Barack Obama recommended it be \u201cconsidered a priority for federal coordination and investment.\u201d  In the coming age of quantum, it\u2019s an open question whether federal funding will enable the U.S to maintain the edge it\u2019s had during the PC era and smartphone wars. Scott Crowder, IBM\u2019s chief technology officer for quantum computing, told a House panel in October that \u201cthe U.S. government investment in driving this critical technology is not sufficient to stay competitive.\u201d  LSU\u2019s Dowling said it could mean the U.S. comes out the loser in the quantum race.  \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is a bunch of different things going on at once with no overall organization,\u201d LSU\u2019s Dowling said, \u201cunlike in China, where they are exactly sure what they\u2019re doing.\u201d  \u2014 With assistance by Dina Bass, Jeremy Kahn, and Ian King", "stock": "IBM", "label": 1, "date": "2018-04-09", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-08/forget-the-trade-war-china-wants-to-win-the-computing-arms-race"}, {"article": "IBM CEO Ginni Rometty Joe Scarnici/Stringer  IBM stock declined 4% in after hours trading Thursday, despite beating analyst expectations for both revenues and earnings per share its fourth quarter 2017 earnings.

Now, IBM wants to change that perception with the launch of its latest additions to its Z-series machines, the IBM z14 Model ZR1, that\u2019s basically a standard 19-inch server rack. With its single-frame design, this new mainframe easily fits into any standard cloud data center or private cloud environment. In addition to the new z14, IBM is also launching an update to the similarly sized Rockhopper server.  In many ways, the new z14 ZR1 is the successor of the company\u2019s entry-level z13s mainframe (though, I guess we can argue over the fact whether any mainframe is really \u2018entry-level\u2019 to begin with). IBM says the new z14 offers 10 percent more capacity and twice the memory (a whopping 8 terabyte) of its predecessor and that it can handle more than 850 million fully encrypted transactions per day on a single system (though IBM didn\u2019t go into details as to what kind of transactions we\u2019re talking about here.  \u201cThis will bring the power of the IBM Z to an even broader center of clients seeking robust security with pervasive encryption, machine learning, cloud capabilities and powerful analytics,\u201dsaid Ross Mauri, general manager of IBM Z, in today\u2019s announcement. \u201cNot only does this increase security and capability in on-premises and hybrid cloud environments for clients, we also will deploy the new systems in our IBM public cloud data centers as we focus on enhancing security and performance for increasingly intensive data loads.\u201d  Mainframes, it\u2019s worth noting, may not be the sexiest computing segment out there, but they remain a solid business for IBM and even in the age of microservices, plenty of companies, especially in the financial services industry, are still betting on these high-powered machines. According to IBM, 44 of the top 50 banks and 90 percent of the largest airlines use its Z-series mainframes today. Unlike its gigantuous predecessors, today\u2019s mainframes don\u2019t need special cooling or energy supplies and these days, they happily run Linux and all of your standard software, too.  In addition to the ZR1, IBM also today launched the LinuxONE Rockhopper II, a more traditional Linux server that also fits into a single-frame 19-inch rack. The new Rockhopper now also support up to 8 terabytes of memory and can handle up to 330,000 Docker containers.

Execs from Google, IBM and Salesforce were questioned about the wider societal implications of their technologies during a panel session here at Mobile World Congress.  Behshad Behzadi, who leads the engineering teams working on Google\u2019s eponymously named AI voice assistant, claimed many jobs will be \u201ccomplemented\u201d by AI, with AI technologies making it \u201ceasier\u201d for humans to carry out tasks.  \u201cFor sure there is some shift in the jobs. There\u2019s lots of jobs which will [be created which don\u2019t exist today]. Think about flight attendant jobs before there was planes and commercial flights. No one could really predict that this job will appear. So there are jobs which will be appearing of that type that are related to the AI,\u201d he said.  \u201cI think the topic is a super important topic. How jobs and AI is related \u2014 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s one company or one country which can solve it alone. It\u2019s all together we could think about this topic,\u201d he added. \u201cBut it\u2019s really an opportunity, it\u2019s not a threat.\u201d  \u201cFrom IBM\u2019s perspective we firmly believe that every profession will be impacted by AI. There\u2019s no question. We also believe that there will be more jobs created,\u201d chimed in Bob Lord, IBM\u2019s chief digital officer. \u201cWe also believe that there\u2019ll be more jobs created.  \u201cI firmly believe that augmenting someone\u2019s intelligence is going to get rid of\u2026 the mundane jobs. And allow us to rise up a level. That we haven\u2019t been able to do before and solve some really, really hard problems.\u201d  Though Lord at least mentioned the conjoined need for retraining to ensure that existing employees and workforces are not left behind the blistering march of technology.  \u201cIn every profession, no one is going to be untouched by [AI]. Even when you talk about the creative world, we\u2019re working with music producers right now to be their creative muse, to help them write songs, hit songs,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any profession in the world that will not be hit by artificial intelligence in the coming years.\u201d  The question of how to pay for mass retraining and upskilling programs necessary for the workers whose mundane jobs are handed to robots went undiscussed.  Salesforce\u2019s John Carney, SVP for telecoms & the media industry, was also keen to spin the accelerating AI-powered shift towards increasing automation as a job creation opportunity. But he conceded it could be a threat to even white collar workers who do not pro-actively upskill and get to grips with using AI-enabled tools to intelligently augment their labor.  \u201cIf you look back in history with these paradigm shifts, these transitions, the data says that we created way more jobs than were eliminated,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I think that\u2019s going to happen again. There is going to be a transition. There\u2019s going to be a need for education, there\u2019s going to be a need to \u2014 especially people like me, my age \u2014 to try to work in this new world.\u201d  \u201cSo I think it\u2019s incumbent on both of us, both the folks that are educating, and the folks that need to be open to lifelong learning,\u201d he continued. \u201cI would say that AI\u2019s going to change all of our jobs \u2014 mostly in a positive way. And I would say that I don\u2019t believe AI is going to eliminate managers and the things that we do.  \u201cBut I will tell you that I think managers who use AI are going to have an advantage over managers that don\u2019t use AI. So I want everyone to get out there and start playing with this. And start experimenting.\u201d  World Economic Forum session moderator, Isabelle Mauro, also asked for the panel\u2019s thoughts on governance policies and how lawmakers can find a model to manage increasingly complex algorithmic technologies \u2014 and indeed the increasingly powerful tech giants which are applying AI at scale, powered by their big data holdings.  Google\u2019s Behzadi stayed quiet on this question. But Salesforce\u2019s Carney spoke up to voice concern about the risk of bias in data sets used to train AIs carrying over and into problematic automated decisions.  \u201cTransparency into how these algorithms are generating these predictions \u2014 that\u2019s really important,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s easy to do.  \u201cBecause there can be bias built into these models and you\u2019ve got to let people see how these decisions and these predictions are being made. So there\u2019s work to do.\u201d  \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s just an AI question. It\u2019s a data ownership question as well,\u201d added IBM\u2019s Lord, advocating plainly for education rather than regulation \u2014 albeit, again, without discussing how the necessary re-skilling programs could be funded.  Instead he discussed children he\u2019s met around the world who he said are keen to learn coding and already expressing curiosity about AI technologies.  He then asked for an IBM video clip to be screened which featured a 12-year-old girl saying she\u2019s more interest in learning coding than learning other languages \u201clike French and Spanish\u201d \u2014 apparently unaware of how tone deaf such a suggestion might appear to an audience comprised of people from around the world and taking place in a Catalan-speaking region of Spain.  It was left to Mauro to quip nervously that it\u2019s \u201cvery scary\u201d if children see no point in learning French to a French speaker like her.  \u201cThere\u2019s a wave of innovation that\u2019s going to come\u2026 that there\u2019s no way we\u2019re going to be able to control. We just have to educate people about being responsible for it,\u201d added Lord, pitching the notion that the rise of automation is both inevitable and all but uncontrollable. \u201cThere\u2019s always good with bad, right. You have to always stay on the side of good.  \u201cI think to regulate something like this, you couldn\u2019t regulate Moore\u2019s Law. You couldn\u2019t regulate Metcalfe\u2019s Law. We\u2019re at the same epicenter around AI.\u201d  The panel session ended with a handful of questions taken from the audience \u2014 sourced via Slido.com. The question submitted by your TechCrunch correspondent received the most votes, and Mauro selected it as the first of the audience asks she put to the panel.  Our question being: What happens to privacy when AI is tracking everything?  Lord jumped in first on this, claiming IBM\u2019s position on privacy is \u201cpretty strong\u201d because it\u2019s operating \u201cin an opt-in world\u201d.  \u201cThere has to be a sense that you as the consumer opt in to use your data in an interesting way. I think it\u2019s for a brand to use your data responsibly,\u201d he said, describing how he\u2019s happy to give Starbucks his data because the coffee company gives him something he values (\u201cgood coffee\u201d).  \u201cSo the permission base of, \u2018I will give you so much data about me so you can use AI and you can use analytics to provide with an increased value exchange\u2019, that\u2019s where you\u2019re going to get that value.  \u201cBut clearly we\u2019re not using AI in any situation to track people that don\u2019t want to be tracked. Or behaviors or doing that in ways that don\u2019t make any sense.\u201d  Google\u2019s Behzadi didn\u2019t sit this one out \u2014 taking the opportunity to make an impromptu demo of Google\u2019s voice assistant by asking how his favorite football team are doing, which in turn revealed the AI knows who his favorite team is without him having to literally name the team.  The implication being that users are willing to trade a portion of their privacy for that kind of incremental convenience. Although he conceded that control of which data gets shared is an important balancing consideration for algorithm builders.  \u201cMy [AI] assistant knows what my favorite team is \u2014 I don\u2019t want to necessarily repeat that each time. The same way that I want to say how\u2019s the traffic to home and work. So you have to \u2014 there\u2019s certain types of information that I do want to share with the assistant but of course we need to always try to have the possibility to say that these types of information you don\u2019t want [to be tracked] because it\u2019s \u2014 because privacy [gets] addressed first,\u201d he said, arguing that concerns about privacy can be balanced if you give users enough control over what aspects of their lives your technology tracks.  \u201cOne general principle around privacy is to have, really, users to be in control. It\u2019s not necessarily something new for AI, it\u2019s also for all the other types of data-based algorithms which we had already before. So as long as we try to always make sure that people are in control of what\u2019s being used, potentially, and what\u2019s not and what is the benefit of the data that I\u2019m sharing.\u201d", "stock": "IBM", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-28", "source": "techcrunch", "url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/02/28/ai-will-create-new-jobs-but-skills-must-shift-say-tech-giants/"}, {"article": "Every major tech company is looking at quantum computers as the next big breakthrough in computing. Teams at Google, Microsoft, Intel, IBM and various startups and academic labs are racing to become the first to achieve quantum supremacy \u2014 that is, the point where a quantum computer can run certain algorithms faster than a classical computer ever could.  Today, Google said that it believes that Bristlecone, its latest quantum processor, can put it on a path to reach quantum supremacy in the future. The purpose of Bristlecone, Google says, it to provide its researchers with a testbed \u201cfor research into system error rates and scalability of our qubit technology, as well as applications in quantum simulation, optimization, and machine learning.\u201d  One of the major issues that all quantum computers have to contend with is error rates. Quantum computers typically run at extremely low temperatures (we\u2019re talking millikelvins here) and are shielded from the environment because today\u2019s quantum bits are still highly unstable and any noise can lead to errors.  Because of this, the qubits in modern quantum processors (the quantum computing versions of traditional bits) aren\u2019t really single qubits but often a combination of numerous bits to help account for potential errors. Another limited factor right now is that most of these systems can only preserve their state for under 100 microseconds.  The systems that Google previously demonstrated showed an error rate of one percent for readout, 0.1 percent for single-qubit and 0.6 percent for two-qubit gates.  Every Bristlecone chip features 72 qubits. The general assumption in the industry is that it will take 49 qubits to achieve quantum supremacy, but Google also cautions that a quantum computer isn\u2019t just about qubits. \u201cOperating a device such as Bristlecone at low system error requires harmony between a full stack of technology ranging from software and control electronics to the processor itself,\u201d the team writes today. \u201cGetting this right requires careful systems engineering over several iterations.\u201d  Google\u2019s announcement today will put some new pressure on other teams that are also working on building functional quantum computers. What\u2019s interesting about the current state of the industry is that everybody is taking different approaches.  Microsoft is currently a bit behind in that its team hasn\u2019t actually produced a qubit yet, but once it does, its approach \u2014 which is very different from Google\u2019s \u2014 could quickly lead to a 49 qubit machine. Microsoft is also working on a programming language for quantum computing.

With these new tools, developers can develop their models with the same open source frameworks they are likely already using (think TensorFlow, Caffe, PyTorch, Keras etc.).

Indeed, as the popularity of cryptocurrencies has grown, so has the banking industry\u2019s interest in blockchain for fintech, with an increased and focused push on bank-backed blockchain projects.  Some of the largest projects underway include the IBM-backed Hyperledger Fabric project, the Utility Settlement Coin, and R3\u2019s blockchain consortium, signifying a growing acceptance in institutional policy to support blockchain growth  How does it work?  Currently, banks transact with each other by creating agreements, as one would when purchasing an item from a store. A common example would be a bank agreeing to purchase a specific amount of stock for a specific cash price from another. This process, often cumbersome and slow, takes up to several days and incurs the risk that one party may default or renege on the agreement. This period of time, known as settlement, is such an issue that an Oliver Wyman report identified it as costing the financial industry anywhere from $65-$80 billion a year.  Blockchain projects have the potential to reduce, and possibly eliminate, settlement times due to their digital nature, ensuring the timely and secure processing of these operations. Other uses for bank-backed blockchain projects would include secured global currency exchange rate speeds and increased transaction security, among other benefits, eventually allowing for an overhaul of the banking industry, replacing traditional back-office clearinghouses and other outdated mediums that exist between asset sellers and buyers.  IBM\u2019s Hyperledger Fabric  The IBM-backed Hyperledger Fabric project is a trade finance platform aimed at international payments utilizing blockchain, with seven of its largest supporters including Deutsche Bank, HSBC, KBC, Natixis, Rabobank, Societe Generale and Unicredit. IBM\u2019s blockchain platform will run through the IBM Cloud, allowing for interconnectivity between all parties in a particular secure transaction.  This project is designed to be highly scalable, allowing for multiple entrants to easily integrate into the entire financial supply chain process through the secure blockchain, allowing for an unprecedented amount of transaction transparency. In mid-October, IBM revealed a partnership with blockchain startup Stellar, spreading the influence of the Hyperledger Fabric project to global levels unseen before.  The Utility Settlement Coin  Six of the world\u2019s largest banks, Barclays, CIBC, Credit Suisse, HSBC, MUFG, and State Street, have announced backing of the UBS and Clearmatics-spearheaded Utility Settlement Coin, joining other industry heavyweights who have already pledged their support for the project, including BNY Mellon, Deutsche Bank, and Santander.  The UTC specifically tackles the use of blockchain technologies by traditional banks, utilizing it as a tool for more efficient transactions. Additionally, the UTC addresses the issue of currency backing, with the UTC being backed by cash at a central bank, preventing default and credit risk. These safeguards play a huge role in why the UTC has so much pledged interest, allowing banks to take part in the relatively young digital currency ecosystem. The UTC is definitely a sign of fintech adoption in the banking industry, ensuring the eventual wide-scale use of blockchain technologies on a standardized level across the globe.  R3  Blockchain consortium R3 is another player in the bank-based blockchain space, raising $107 million in May, with four of its backers being Temasek, SBI Group, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, and Intel, with further support pledged from industry heavyweights such as Wells Fargo and ING. One of R3\u2019s primary projects has been the development of their Corda platform, with future plans for an infrastructure network specifically geared toward financial institutions to build their own ledger-based applications and services, implying that these banks currently have and will grow their own teams of blockchain developers. R3 is also focused on governmental acceptance of blockchain, with buy-in from these institutions signifying a drastic shift in terms of governmental compliance and usage of such fintech.  By presenting credible potential resolutions of current-day issues, these projects represent large-scale efforts by the banking industry to fully embrace and integrate blockchain into their current infrastructures.

IBM is expected to have gotten an extra lift in the most recent quarter from currency gains and strong sales of a new line of mainframe computers. Without that help, the company\u2019s revenue would decline by 2 percent or so, according to an estimate from A. M. Sacconaghi, a financial analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein.  \u201cIs a turnaround afoot? I don\u2019t see it yet,\u201d Mr. Sacconaghi said.  There is no doubt, though, that there are signs of progress at IBM, which would not comment on its financial picture before the release of the earning report. So much attention is focused on the company\u2019s top line because revenue is the broadest measure of the headway IBM is making in a difficult transformation toward cloud computing, data handling and A.I. offerings for corporate customers.  Photo  The new businesses \u2014 \u201cstrategic imperatives,\u201d IBM calls them \u2014 now account for 45 percent of the company\u2019s revenue. And though it still has a ways to go, IBM has steadily built up those operations \u2014 and gained converts.  The number of software developers using its cloud technology has doubled in the last year, IBM says, though it would not provide numbers. On Wednesday, Barclays upgraded IBM\u2019s stock to a buy and noted its long-term opportunity in the cloud market. IBM\u2019s stock price, a notable laggard as markets have surged in recent years, has climbed nearly 10 percent so far this year.  IBM was slow to recognize the significance of cloud computing and software tools delivered as Internet-style services. In artificial intelligence, the company scored a research and public relations triumph in 2011, when its Watson system defeated human champions in the question-and-answer game, \u201cJeopardy!\u201d But IBM first applied the Watson technology to the daunting realm of cancer research, a lengthy struggle with little short-term financial reward.  Today, IBM trails well behind Amazon Web Services and Microsoft in the cloud market, according to analysts. Yet IBM has invested heavily in more than 60 cloud data centers in 19 countries in the past three years. And the most recent analysis by IDC, a technology research firm, and a report last month by Jefferies, a Wall Street firm, ranked IBM third in the category, ahead of Google.  The Watson technology has been retooled as dozens of different services including text understanding, language translation, image recognition and sentiment analysis \u2014 all delivered via the cloud and available \u00e0 la carte.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  IBM\u2019s strategy is to offer businesses cloud computing, A.I. technology and industry expertise tailored for each customer. Big companies, said David Kenny, senior vice president for IBM\u2019s Watson and cloud businesses, are adapting cloud and A.I. technology to make their businesses faster and smarter.  \u201cWe start from our strength in knowing how enterprises operate,\u201d Mr. Kenny said. \u201cWe\u2019re a trusted partner for companies in this data and A.I. wave.\u201d  Photo  Companies want to move quickly, Mr. Kenny said, but they often want to exploit the speed and flexibility of cloud technology from within their own computer centers, where they figure their vital business data is more secure.  AT&T began a project with IBM last fall to accelerate the use of cloud technology in developing and updating the telecommunications giant\u2019s 2,200 in-house software applications. IBM \u2014 a longtime technology supplier to AT&T \u2014 was chosen both for its cloud expertise and its industry knowledge, said Sorabh Saxena, AT&T\u2019s president of business operations.  The AT&T-IBM collaboration involves breaking down programs into cloud-based building blocks of code called microservices, each of which handles a certain task. So a new feature for mobile payments, for example, can be adopted quickly by updating a few lines of code rather than having to rewrite an entire program.

Most of this business software uses cloud technology that runs inside AT&T data centers \u2014 in a so-called private cloud, in contrast to a public cloud in which computing services are delivered from remote data centers owned by another company. Many corporations opt for private clouds to house their most sensitive customer and business data.  \u201cFor certain parts of our business, IBM was the ideal partner,\u201d Mr. Saxena said.  IBM emphasizes its hybrid stance in the cloud market, offering both private and public cloud technology to its corporate clients. In its financial reporting, IBM also includes all the hardware, software and services it sells to companies to build private clouds in its total cloud revenue, which would put it on a par with Amazon.  Most industry analysts focus on the public cloud market, assuming it will grow faster as companies build fewer data centers themselves. In the public cloud market, IBM has revenue of about $2 billion a year, growing at 30 percent, according to the most recent estimate by IDC. By contrast, Amazon generates more than $12 billion a year and Microsoft about $6.5 billion.  Yet for IBM, its underlying cloud software is crucial to building a big A.I. business with Watson. \u201cIBM has a strong set of assets in A.I.,\u201d said Ed Anderson, an analyst at Gartner. \u201cAnd cloud is the answer to getting Watson in the hands of developers.\u201d  Photo  That was the appeal for Opentopic, a start-up that uses A.I. technology to mine online and corporate data for marketing insights. Opentopic switched from Amazon Web Services to the IBM cloud in 2015, largely to tap Watson\u2019s code modules for text, image and sentiment analysis, so the Opentopic developers had to write less code themselves.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  \u201cIt allows us to prototype rapidly,\u201d said Andre Konig, a co-founder of Opentopic. \u201cAnd Watson is the artificial intelligence layer that makes that possible.\u201d  The start-up\u2019s clients include Unilever, Abbott Laboratories and The Economist. Today, Opentopic does all its software development on the IBM cloud, but that will most likely change soon.  It is working with a new company that runs its business on the Amazon cloud. \u201cWe need to be where our customers are,\u201d Mr. Konig said. \u201cThe future is going to be multi-cloud,\u201d meaning businesses will use various services.  His comment points to a brewing issue for IBM \u2014 and perhaps one that will help determine the resilience of Ms. Rometty\u2019s turnaround campaign.  IBM is putting all its advanced technology on the cloud \u2014 not just artificial intelligence, but also blockchain and quantum computing. If others are leaders in the underlying cloud layers, why not focus higher up and distribute its leading-edge technology on other clouds as well?  IBM says its Watson software, for example, is fine-tuned down to the chip level for the IBM cloud. But some analysts suggest that IBM may eventually take another path, working with Amazon, Microsoft and Google.  \u201cIf IBM does that,\u201d said Frank Gens, IDC\u2019s chief analyst, \u201cits chance of being a cloud leader goes way up.\u201d", "stock": "IBM", "label": -1, "date": "2018-01-17", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/17/technology/ibm-earnings.html"}, {"article": "Others say companies have little moral standing to criticize Facebook\u2019s practices, when they have themselves relied on the social network to acquire customers, using the same ad-targeting tools that rely on personal data that have stirred up so much controversy in the context of politics.  \u201cI think we just have to acknowledge the entire industry\u2019s complicity with what\u2019s happening with Facebook,\u201d said Glenn Kelman, chief executive of Redfin, an internet real estate firm. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like we\u2019re Inspector Renault in \u2018Casablanca\u2019 where we say we\u2019re shocked, shocked with what\u2019s happening and then a moment later someone hands us our winnings.\u201d  \u201cWe\u2019ve all been advertising avidly on Facebook,\u201d Mr. Kelman added.

Today, facial recognition software is being deployed by companies in various ways, including to help target product pitches based on social media profile pictures. But companies are also experimenting with face identification and other A.I. technology as an ingredient in automated decisions with higher stakes like hiring and lending.  Researchers at the Georgetown Law School estimated that 117 million American adults are in face recognition networks used by law enforcement \u2014 and that African Americans were most likely to be singled out, because they were disproportionately represented in mug-shot databases.  Facial recognition technology is lightly regulated so far.  \u201cThis is the right time to be addressing how these A.I. systems work and where they fail \u2014 to make them socially accountable,\u201d said Suresh Venkatasubramanian, a professor of computer science at the University of Utah.  Until now, there was anecdotal evidence of computer vision miscues, and occasionally in ways that suggested discrimination.

Ms. Buolamwini, a young African-American computer scientist, experienced the bias of facial recognition firsthand. When she was an undergraduate at the Georgia Institute of Technology, programs would work well on her white friends, she said, but not recognize her face at all. She figured it was a flaw that would surely be fixed before long.  Photo  But a few years later, after joining the M.I.T. Media Lab, she ran into the missing-face problem again.

To test the commercial systems, Ms. Buolamwini built a data set of 1,270 faces, using faces of lawmakers from countries with a high percentage of women in office. The sources included three African nations with predominantly dark-skinned populations, and three Nordic countries with mainly light-skinned residents.  The African and Nordic faces were scored according to a six-point labeling system used by dermatologists to classify skin types. The medical classifications were determined to be more objective and precise than race.  Then, each company\u2019s software was tested on the curated data, crafted for gender balance and a range of skin tones. The results varied somewhat. Microsoft\u2019s error rate for darker-skinned women was 21 percent, while IBM\u2019s and Megvii\u2019s rates were nearly 35 percent.

But it is not the only risk. The new tariffs will inflict damage on the American economy even absent retaliation from abroad. If history is any guide, Mr. Trump is proposing to protect the homeland by shooting it in the foot.  The closest parallel is the moment in 2002 when President George W. Bush decided that, for the umpteenth time, domestic steel makers deserved a hand and imposed tariffs of 8 to 30 percent on a variety of steel products from many countries.  Imports from the affected countries plummeted, of course. But others \u2014 in steel categories not covered by the safeguard and from excluded countries protected by preferential deals \u2014 surged. Overall steel imports increased 3 percent over the next 12 months. Employment in the American steel industry kept declining. And according to one study, by the time the tariffs were lifted in 2003, higher steel prices had cost 200,000 jobs in steel-using companies, more than all the jobs in the steel industry itself.  Undeterred, President Barack Obama did roughly the same thing. After complaints about surging imports, he put tariffs on Chinese tires. Presumably nobody told him that American tire makers no longer produced the kind of low-grade tires exported by the Chinese. In any event, imports from other countries jumped 20 percent after the tariff was imposed. And the price of all imported tires rose by 18 percent, on average.  Gary Clyde Hufbauer and Sean Lowry at the Peterson Institute for International Economics calculated the additional cost to consumers at $1.1 billion \u2014 or about $900,000 per tire job saved. But the wages of workers whose jobs were saved amounted to about 5 percent of that.  The lesson is not that protectionism is porous. It is. And it can be gamed. Until a few years ago, Ford attached rear seats and rear windows to the Transit Connect vans it imported from its plant in Turkey. Once they had gone through customs \u2014 paying the 2.5 percent tariff on passenger vehicles instead of the heftier 25 percent levied on commercial vans \u2014 the seats and windows were ripped out and recycled.  The critical takeaway is that the distortions brought about by trade barriers impose a cost on the economy. It might not be easy to spot before the fact, but it tends to be more substantial than whatever fleeting gains protectionism can bring about to the protected.

A study by the United States International Trade Commission cited by the Dartmouth economist Douglas A. Irwin in his 2002 book, \u201cFree Trade Under Fire,\u201d concluded that it had raised apparel prices by 18 to 24 percent, imposing a particular burden on poor households.

Japan\u2019s Toshiba stopped making laptops in the United States. Apple moved production to Ireland. An IBM spokesman called the decision \u201can eviction notice from the U.S. government to the fastest-growing part of the U.S. computer industry.\u201d  Similarly, the ring of protection around the sugar industry almost killed it instead. Hoping to protect a price floor for sugar of 16.75 cents a pound even as world prices sank, in the 1980s Washington resorted to increasingly stringent import quotas that drove domestic sugar prices up to five times the world average.  Clever Canadian firms sent sugary cake mixes to the United States \u2014 where the sugar was extracted. Other countries grabbed on to the tactic. In 1985, Washington put emergency quotas on all imports of sweetened cocoa, cake mixes and edible preparations. South Korean noodles \u2014 with 0.002 percent sugar content \u2014 were snagged in the dragnet. So was kosher pizza from Israel.  Then the unthinkable happened: Coke and Pepsi decided to replace expensive sugar with much cheaper high-fructose corn syrup. From 1980 to 1987, the share of sugar in American sweetener consumption, previously 65 percent, dropped to 47 percent.  \u201cIn the longer term, this market reaction to the sugar program may indeed threaten the economic viability of the entire sugar industry in the United States,\u201d the economist Anne O. Krueger noted in an analysis of the sugar supports.  Sugar quotas are still around, nonetheless. Candy makers including Hershey and Ferrara have moved factories offshore. In 2006, the International Trade Administration concluded that for each sugar growing and harvesting job saved between 1997 and 2002, three confectionary manufacturing jobs were lost.  Sugar quotas even undermined American policy to counter narcotics trafficking. The Central Intelligence Agency concluded that falling sugar exports encouraged farmers in Jamaica and Belize to switch to marijuana.  Mr. Trump might look back fondly at that long-ago chicken tax. In the 1980s, Detroit did everything it could to fend off Japanese automakers. It persuaded the Reagan administration to force the Japanese into \u201cvoluntary\u201d export restraints on cars \u2014 raising car prices for American consumers.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Nothing was as successful as the chicken wall. It eroded over time. S.U.V.s were ultimately allowed into the United States as cars. Japanese automakers started making monster pickups and S.U.V.s in the United States, too. Still, fewer than a quarter of cars sold in the United States are made in America. The share for light trucks is 54 percent.  But there was a cost: more expensive pickup trucks, for starters, not to mention the discarded seats and windows from Ford\u2019s Transit Connects. The tariff also successfully kept smaller, low-margin trucks from competing with the less-efficient models made at home. Alongside low gasoline prices and easy fuel-economy standards, Detroit\u2019s love affair with trucks arguably gave the United States the least fuel-efficient fleet in the industrial world.  If gasoline prices were to rise \u2014 say, in an effort to combat climate change \u2014 a gas-guzzling domestic auto industry could prove a weak link in the nation\u2019s security.", "stock": "IBM", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-13", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/13/business/economy/trade-chicken.html"}, {"article": "Sick of watching Amazon and Google have all the fun, IBM has officially unveiled its very own smart assistant based on its storied Watson technology, simply named the Watson Assistant.  Using Watson as the base of its AI calculations and formerly known as \u2018Watson Conversation,\u2019 the Watson Assistant will be accessible via text or voice. IBM\u2019s partners can also choose to incorporate the assistant into their devices or services.  Herein lies the purported beauty behind Watson Assistant.  IBM isn\u2019t tying its Watson Assistant to any one device or category, but rather licensing out the technology to its countless business partners to implement into their own products and services. With this, IBM\u2019s goal is to get Watson into all sorts of artificial intelligence or machine learning applications.  Whether in your smart home or in your car \u2013 as IBM demonstrated at its inaugural Think conference in Las Vegas through a concept Maserati GranCabrio\u2019s digital cockpit, Engadget reports \u2013 or even in your hotel room, the idea is for Watson to make those experiences easier.  For instance, in IBM\u2019s example scenario a Watson-powered hotel automatically checks in guests while the room spools up the user\u2019s favorite music and temperature preference; the service could also supply users with a rental car before their arrival. In this scenario, you\u2019d unlock your hotel door with an electronic key in your phone, natch.  The guerrilla fighter in the smart assistant wars  This is clearly IBM\u2019s move to beat its more consumer-bent competitors to a smart assistant for commercial partners, and a follow-up to its Watson for Cybersecurity service. Smart assistants like Amazon\u2019s Alexa and Google\u2019s Assistant may have all but conquered the smartphone, tablet, and corners of the smart home, but not so the professional world.  That\u2019s because these assistants have only recently began branching out into other products, almost all of which are consumer-oriented devices and services. Watson Assistant, on the other hand, was built expressly to power businesses\u2019 smart assistant efforts.  On top of that, IBM touts that its approach to smart assistants is, well, smarter, with Watson Assistant promising to learn from your commands and actions and how you carry them out, remembering your preferences. If you allow these Watson-based devices or services to share data over the IBM Cloud that makes the assistant work, Watson Assistant can engage in more realistic conversations with context.  Of course, this assumes mass adoption, not to mention your comfort level with Watson-based services and products sharing your data amongst themselves. IBM promises that Watson is ready and able to protect your data, naturally.  We\u2019ll have to wait some time to see whether Watson Assistant can present a challenged to Alexa and Google Assistant, especially in the car and home categories.

At the heart of these digital currencies is the technology of the blockchain, which dates back to 2008. This is distributed ledger tech that provides a decentralized and transparent method for transactions, while maintaining a high level of security.  To date, the most successful application of the blockchain has been in cryptocurrency. However, this same technology will certainly make itself felt across a variety of other sectors \u2013 which should brace themselves for the impending disruption. In this article, we\u2019re highlighting 10 such arenas that will certainly feel the impact of the blockchain\u2026  Check out how Microsoft is making a blockchain that\u2019s fit for business  1. Voting  A limitation to modern elections is that they require the voter to be physically present at the polling booth to cast their vote, which can often make things awkward in terms of finding the time to travel \u2013 and makes little sense in our mobile, connected society. Another bone of contention is the possibility of voter fraud, with losing candidates potentially engaging in legal battles which can delay the result, and even cost the taxpayer when it comes to conducting a recount.  The application of blockchain technology could eliminate voter fraud, providing a clear record of the votes cast, and preventing any chance of a rigged election. Furthermore, this could all be done on a mobile platform, allowing busy individuals the opportunity to cast their vote without going to a polling station. Follow My Vote promises an \u2018online voting solution for the modern age\u2019 via blockchain technology.  2. Healthcare  While healthcare has mostly moved on from paper-based records, it\u2019s still an industry which is ripe for modernization via the blockchain. Current challenges in this sector include keeping patient records private from hackers, while allowing authorized access by providers.  Applying blockchain technology to healthcare records promises improved data security, with better access for healthcare professionals and patients alike, and greater transparency for healthcare transactions. Gem has partnered with healthcare tech firm Philips in this space.  3. Photography  Photographers can face challenges when it comes to getting paid royalties for their snaps, especially in our digital world where image theft is often just a click away.  With that in mind, at the recent CES show in Las Vegas, Kodak revealed its new digital currency, KODAKCoin, which is backed by a blockchain ledger and image rights platform called KODAKOne. Kodak hopes that the new virtual currency will help protect digital image rights for photographers, allowing them to securely register their work.  4. Internet of Things (IoT)  The IoT promises an ever-growing number of online devices to monitor and contribute to our connected lifestyle. But a significant barrier to the adoption of various smart gadgets is the walled ecosystems which some manufacturers insist upon, locking out devices from other vendors, and generally making things harder for the consumer looking to use a variety of different bits of hardware.  In 2015, IBM and Samsung showed off an application of the blockchain known as ADEPT (Autonomous Decentralized Peer-to-Peer Telemetry), which is designed to decentralize the IoT, and allow devices to communicate directly, without a manufacturer\u2019s hub getting in the way and trying to lock users into a particular ecosystem.  5. Cloud storage  Storing data in the cloud has become an increasingly popular and convenient practice, although it still has potential problems \u2013 like downtime and losing access to your data temporarily, or more seriously, the cloud service being hacked.  Storj is a company that\u2019s using the blockchain for open source cloud storage. Users are connected via blockchain and peer-to-peer technology, with a distributed network to store their data on. Folks with spare storage can also rent it out for income via the Storj app, as the storage space is crowd-sourced.  6. Public records  Our governments are entrusted to store a wide variety of information about individual citizens, including a lot of sensitive material such as financial data on tax returns or property records. Much of this information still exists only in paper form, or in siloed databases, and managing this data can be complicated, as it must be available, without error, and protected from hacking and manipulation.  The use of the blockchain represents an innovative solution to encode this data in a digital ledger, keeping the info safe from being altered. In the US, Delaware-based Ubitquity has the first blockchain-based system (currently in alpha) for property record management including titles, which is in testing overseas at the Land Records Bureau in Brazil.  7. Banking  Financial institutions continue to face challenges with identity theft, cost efficiency of transactions, and just general security. The blockchain will certainly digitally disrupt this industry, and holds the potential key to faster transactions, at less cost, and with a higher degree of security. IBM has partnered with Axoni and R3 to develop and deploy distributed ledger technology to the financial industry.  8. Car leasing  Leasing a car can end up being a protracted process, with multiple parties involved in the transaction, all needing to verify information before the car rolls off the lot. DocuSign, which specializes in secure digital documents, has partnered with credit card giant Visa to apply blockchain technology to Smart Contracts that promise a streamlined \u2018click, sign and drive\u2019 approach to securely leasing a vehicle. Now if only they could reduce the price of those floor mats...  9. Music rights  Soon after music went digital with MP3 files, music piracy was close behind, with artists losing control of their work, and record companies unhappy over the lost revenue stream.  The entertainment industry is looking to blockchain technology to secure digital rights for music and other media, with the potential to recapture that income. The British company JAAK has grabbed attention with its effort to create Smart Content with a \u201cglobal view of content ownership and rights\u201d.  10. Worker credentials  When companies hire an individual for a job, they want to get the best qualified person with the most appropriate experience levels. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to discern the truth behind the average resume or CV, as more than half of folks reportedly lie on their job applications \u2013 and indeed one study showed that a quarter of applicants said they\u2019d worked for companies which in fact had never employed them.  This problem also arises at universities that need to verify the credentials of their faculty, and at hospitals that face a similar challenge when it comes to staff physicians and other healthcare professionals.  The Learning Machine is a company that hopes to change this. By applying blockchain technology, worker and professional credentials can be verified and kept in a secure digital ledger, which cannot be altered down the road to fit another position the applicant is subsequently interested in. The firm promises inherent fraud protection which could make choosing the right person for a job a good deal easier.", "stock": "IBM", "label": 1, "date": "2018-01-16", "source": "techradar", "url": "http://www.techradar.com/news/here-are-the-10-sectors-that-blockchain-will-disrupt-forever"}, {"article": "Experimental feature Listen to this article Play audio for this article Pause 00:00 00:00 Experimental feature Report a mispronounced word What was mispronounced?

Today many people rate plastic waste, particularly in the oceans, as a problem approaching climate change in its gravity.  Graphic images have raised public consciousness. Photographs have shown some of the world\u2019s most remote beaches that were pristine sand a decade or two ago now covered with plastic litter.  Films and television programmes such as David Attenborough\u2019s immensely popular Blue Planet II series have recorded heart-rending scenes of seabirds and marine creatures dying from plastics that they have mistakenly eaten or from debris entangled around their bodies.  People are also becoming alarmed by reading about the less visible but more pernicious problem of microplastics with dimensions measured in fractions of a millimetre. These come from various sources including the disintegration of larger plastic items, microbeads added to health and beauty products, and microfibres separating from clothing and fabrics during cleaning and laundry. The tiny particles and fibres are ingested by marine wildlife, with adverse consequences that environmental toxicologists are just beginning to investigate.  As the clamour to \u201cdo something\u201d rises in volume, politicians are responding with pledges to increase recycling and to reduce unnecessary plastic packaging. At the same time, research funds are starting to move into the field, prompting scientists and engineers to come up with ideas to tackle the problem, both by finding ways to remove existing waste from the oceans and, more importantly, to stem the flow of new plastics into the environment.  Professor Mariana Mazzucato of University College London proposed that Europe\u2019s next Framework research programme should adopt \u201ca plastic-free ocean\u201d as one of its grand challenges.  \u201cThis mission could have clear target to reduce the amount of plastic entering the marine environment by 90 per cent, and of collecting more than half of the plastic currently present in our oceans, seas and coastal areas,\u201d she says in a paper commissioned by EU science and innovation commissioner Carlos Moedas.  This would mean stopping at least 7.2m tonnes of plastic entering the marine environment and collecting at least 2m tonnes of plastic per annum, the paper adds, concluding that \u201ca very ambitious yet achievable timeline to reach this target would be circa five to 10 years\u201d.  Such a comprehensive attempt to tackle the crisis will require basic and applied research, as well as entrepreneurial innovation. The greatest technological challenge will be removing plastics from the oceans, through nets and booms moving across the sea surface which would gather up and remove or destroy rubbish \u2014 all without harming ocean life. The first targets might be the ocean gyres, circulating currents where plastics accumulate, of which the most notorious has become known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.  The Ocean Cleanup, a Dutch foundation that is planning to launch a clean-up operation there later this year, estimated in a study carried out from boats and aircraft and published this month that the Patch contains 1.8tn pieces of plastic weighing a total of 80,000 tonnes, covering 1.6m sq km of the North Pacific between California and Hawaii.  \u201cThese results provide us with the key data to develop and test our technology,\u201d says Boyan Slat, founder of Ocean Cleanup. \u201cSince the results indicate that the amount of hazardous microplastics is set to increase more than tenfold if left to fragment, the time to start is now.\u201d  The clean-up system is itself made of durable plastic. \u201cIt\u2019s quite poetic, like using fire to extinguish fire,\u201d says Mr Slat.  Floating screens extend 3m deep into the sea, suspended from ultra-strong U-shaped tubes 1km long and held in place by a drogue or sea anchor. As ocean currents flow past the screens they collect plastic debris, which can be collected every couple of months by ships for recycling or incineration.  If this year\u2019s trial of the first system goes well, Mr Slat hopes that as many as 60 collectors will be operating in the early 2020s, removing about half of the plastic from the Great Pacific Garbage Patch within five years.  Stopping plastics getting into the oceans in the first place will require a huge change in consumer behaviour and product design \u2014 fuelled by a global commitment by governments and business to phase out non-essential single-use plastics, particularly for packaging, and make it easier to recycle remaining plastic waste.  Such a circular economy will require plastic products to have a simple design, in which the different components are easily separated and the polymers from which they are made are clearly identifiable. At present the sorting machinery in recycling plants faces a confusing variety of materials mixed \u2014 or, worse, bonded \u2014 together.  Polymer chemists will also need to come up with new ways to recycle plastics that are elusive under current technology. A recent paper in the journal Science by Jeannette Garcia of IBM Almaden research centre in California and Megan Robertson of the University of Houston concluded that only two types of polymer are routinely recycled today: PET and polyethylenes, representing just 9 per cent and 37 per cent respectively of plastic production.  Researchers are already developing cost-effective new chemical recycling technologies for other plastics such as polystyrene. Such efforts, the authors say, \u201craise hope that before long recycling rates for plastics will be much higher than today\u201d.", "stock": "IBM", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-29", "source": "financial-times", "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/0f3627ec-db6e-11e7-9504-59efdb70e12f"}, {"article": "Experimental feature Listen to this article Play audio for this article Pause 00:00 00:00 Experimental feature Report a mispronounced word What was mispronounced?

Our behaviour is changing as a result of an information and communications overload, both at work and in our personal lives. Finding a way to manage the barrage is an important challenge as the information economy develops.  Distractions at work, such as the constant inflow of emails, notifications and pop-up chats, take their toll. One study, by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University, found that the mere prospect of being distracted by a ringing mobile phone reduced test participants\u2019 cognition skills, measured by a test involving reading a passage of text and being asked questions about it.  Our addiction to smartphones and social media is also making us more fidgety. One study of Android users by research company Dscout found that people tapped, swiped and clicked their smartphones 2,617 times a day. Apple\u2019s products are sufficiently addictive to prompt activist investors to demand research be done into the negative impacts of phone use on children. There is growing concern about a mental health crisis in young people caused by the addictiveness of social media, the internet, and gaming.  When you get bored you ignite the \u2018default mode\u2019 in your brain, and this is where we do our most original thinking  \u201cThere is nothing new about the existence of an attention economy that monetises our eyeballs,\u201d says Cal Newport, associate professor of computer science at Georgetown University and author of Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World. \u201cBut when you combine this business model with powerful handheld devices that are always connected to the internet, algorithms being weaponized to extract as much of our time and attention as possible, and hundreds of billions of dollars of investment, suddenly the societal impacts become worrisome.\u201d  Prof Newport is worried about the next generation. \u201cIt is almost certainly true that young people are suffering a rapid decline in their ability to concentrate. Given the increasing share of the economy dedicated to knowledge work, in which concentrated thought is the primary driver of value production, this decline might start to impact large scale economic metrics, if it hasn\u2019t already\u201d.  Overcoming overload is hard, because we are addicted to information \u2014 or, more specifically, to novelty  If information overload stops us concentrating deeply, it also stops us resting deeply \u2014 and that is just as damaging. Boredom, zoning out and absent-mindedness are all fertile mental states for creativity. \u201cWe\u2019re at an interesting moment in neuroscience in terms of understanding how boredom is a gateway to mind-wandering,\u201d says Manoush Zomorodi, host of the WNYC podcast Note to Self and author of Bored and Brilliant.  \u201cWhen you get bored, say you are folding laundry, or doing something that doesn\u2019t require focused attention, you ignite the \u2018default mode\u2019 in your brain, and this is where we do our most original thinking,\u201d she says. \u201cWe take two seemingly disparate ideas and smash them together to make something new. And we do autobiographical planning. We look back at our life, take note of highs and lows, create personal narratives, and look at our future and decide where we want to go.\u201d  If in a quiet moment we instead check for emails or social media updates, then we may be in danger of losing the experience of boredom entirely.  Overcoming overload is hard, because we are addicted to information \u2014 or, more specifically, to novelty. This was helpful in the hunter-gatherer era, because it could lead us to food and resources. It is less helpful online, where we cannot ever be satiated. Companies are tapping this foraging-related brain circuitry to make products more addictive. One gamification firm, with clients including Disney and Google, even named itself Dopamine, after the brain chemical.  Some of Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest names are raising the alarm, from Facebook\u2019s founding president Sean Parker to former Google design ethicist Tristan Harris.  Is there a solution?  \u00a9 EPA  Yet there are glimmers of hope. Consumers, and even investors, are paying more attention to the problem. Facebook published a study confirming that its users do indeed feel worse after \u2018passively\u2019 consuming social media. It argued however that social media increased wellbeing when people used them actively, especially when \u201csharing messages, posts and comments with close friends and reminiscing about past interactions\u201d. It recently announced changes to its news feed, to prioritise the sharing of meaningful content between friends.  At work, companies are deploying software, artificial intelligence and machine learning to bring order and structure to the informational chaos that many office workers now feel. Slack can reduce email overload by shifting high-volume, open-ended communications into chat forums. IBM Verse and SalesforceIQ sift information and prioritise actions for staff. Google has rolled out auto-reply suggestions on Gmail, with algorithms proposing possible replies to messages, and tools like Evernote consolidate scattered online and offline notes, links and resources.  Then there are the apps and internet blockers which forcibly disconnect people from certain sites, or during certain times, including Thrive App, from Arianna Huffington\u2019s wellbeing consultancy and Samsung.  The power of the humble notebook  Meanwhile Prof Newport, who gained tenure at the young age of 33 without working in the evenings or at weekends, says the humble notebook is his tool of choice. His reasons are subtle, relating to the ways in which the finitude of three dimensional space shapes our thinking. \u201cWhen scheduling your day in a notebook, the fact that the page is a fixed size embodies the reality that your time and attention are limited commodities. Days scheduled on paper tend to be more realistic and balanced than those driven [by] a bottomless inbox or voluminous digital task list.\u201d  Research also shows that writing on paper fires up the brain circuitry associated with language processing and engenders more attentive reading. All of which might give us reason to pause before rolling out the tablets, laptops and digital education for an already screen-sapped generation.

The thing is, while quantum computing is a technology for the world of tomorrow, it hasn't yet advanced far enough for anyone to know what that world will actually look like.  \"People aren't going to just wake up in three or four years, and say, 'Oh okay, now I'm ready to use quantum, what do I have to learn,'\" Bob Sutor, VP of IBM Q Strategy and Ecosystem at IBM Research, told Engadget.  These systems rely on the \"spooky\" properties of quantum physics, as Einstein put it, and their operation is radically different from how today's computers work. \"What you're basically doing is you're replacing the notion of bits with something called qubits,\" Sutor said. \"Ultimately when you measure a qubit it's zero or one, but before that there's a realm of freedom of what that can actually be. It's not zero and one at the same time or anything like this, it just takes on values from a much, much larger mathematical space.  \"The basic logic gates [AND, OR, NOT, NOR, etc], those gates are different for quantum,\" he continued. \"The way the different qubits work together to get to a solution is completely different from the way the bits within your general memory works.\" Rather than tackling problems in sequence, as classical computers do, quantum rigs attempt to solve them in parallel. This enables quantum computers to solve certain equations, such as modeling complex molecules, far more efficiently.  This efficiency, however, is tempered by the system's frailty. Currently, a qubit's coherence time tops out at 90 microseconds before decaying. That is, if a qubit is designated as a 1, it'll only remain a 1 for 0.0009 seconds. \"After that all bets are off. You've got a certain amount of time in which to actually use this thing reliably,\" Sutor said. \"Any computations you're going to do with a qubit have to come within that period.\"  As such quantum computers are highly sensitive to interference from temperature, microwaves, photons, even the electricity running the machine itself. Sutor said, \"With heat you've got lots of electrons moving around, bumping into each other,\" which can lead to the qubit's decoherence. That's why these rigs have to be cooled to near absolute zero on order to operate.  \"Outer space in the shade is between two and three degree Kelvin,\" Sutor explained. \"Outer space is much too warm to do these types of calculations.\" Instead, the lowest levels of a quantum computer rig, where the calculations themselves take place, exist at a frosty 10 millikelvin -- a hundreth of a degree above absolute zero. So no, Sutor assured Engadget, we probably shouldn't expect desktop quantum computers running at room temperature to exist within the next few decades -- perhaps even within our lifetimes.  Surprisingly, these systems are fairly energy efficient. Aside from the energy needed to sufficiently cool the system for operation (a process that takes around 36 hours) IBM's 50-qubit rig only draws 10 to 15 kilowatts of power -- roughly equivalent to 10 standard microwave ovens.  So now that IBM has developed a number of quantum computer systems ranging from 5 to 50 qubits, the next challenge is figuring out what to do with them. And that's where the company's Q network comes in. Last December, IBM announced that it's partnering with a number of Fortune 500 companies and research institutes -- including JPMorgan Chase, Samsung, Honda, Japan's Keio University, Oak Ridge National Lab and Oxford University -- to suss out potential practical applications for the technology.  Learning centers like Keio University also act as localized hubs. \"We in IBM research, while we have a large team on this, we can't work with everybody in the world who wants to work on quantum computing,\" Sutor explained. These hubs, however, \"can work with local companies, local colleges, whomever to do whatever. They would get their quantum computer power from us, but they would be at the front lines.\" The same is true for Oakridge National Lab, Oxford University and the University of Melbourne.  What's more, the company has also launched the IBM Q experience which allows anyone -- businesses, universities, even private citizens -- to write and submit their own quantum application or experiment to be run on the company's publicly available quantum computing rig. It's essentially a cloud service for quantum computations. So far more than 75,000 people have taken advantage of the service, running more than 2.5 million calculations which have resulted in more than two dozen published research papers on subjects ranging from quantum phase space measurement to homomorphic encryption.  But while the public's interest in this technology is piqued, there is a significant knowledge gap that must be overcome before we start to see quantum applications proliferate the way classical programs did in the 1970s and '80s. \"Let's say in the future you're running investment house types of calculations [similar to the financial risk applications that JP Morgan is currently developing],\" Sutor points out, \"there are big questions as to what those would be, and what the algorithms would be. We're way too early to have anything determined like that, even to the extent of knowing how well [quantum computing] will be applicable in some of these other areas.\"  The entry point for writing programs is a challenge too. For classical computers, it's as simple as running a compiler. But there's not yet such a function for quantum computers. \"What does it mean to optimize a quantum program knowing that this completely different from the model that's in your phone?\" he queried.  Another challenge that must be overcome is how to scale these machines. As Sutor points out, it's a simple enough task to add qubits to silicon chips, but every component added, increases the amount of heat generated and the amount of energy needed to keep the system within its operational temperature boundaries.  So rather than simply packing in more and more qubits and setting off a quantum version of Moore's Law, Sutor believes that the next major step forward for this technology is quality over quantity. \"Having 50 great qubits is much more powerful than having 2,000 lousy ones,\" he quipped. \"You don't want something very noisy that you're going to have to fix,\" but instead research should focus on improving the system's fidelity over increasing the qubit count.", "stock": "IBM", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-23", "source": "engadget", "url": "https://www.engadget.com/2018/02/23/ibm-q-quantum-computer-experiments/"}, {"article": "In addition, adding the CEO of American Express to the board is valuable for Facebook as they are trying to step into the payments space.

Google and groups like the EFF make up the opposition, warning the government that the bill would drastically change the Communications Decency Act, which allowed the internet to flourish. The Electronic Frontier Foundation said it will lead to platforms policing user speech. After all, if they don't screen their users' posts, then they could get sued left and right. That means smaller websites and non-profit orgs that don't have the means to moderate every post are the most at risk. \"The tragedy,\" according to the EFF, \"is that FOSTA isn't needed to prosecute or sue sex traffickers.\" Backpage is reportedly under federal investigation even though it has cited CDA in the past.  Within the government, though, the bill seems to be enjoying support from both political parties and from various authorities. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance, Jr. told The Washington Post: \"The ability to hold websites criminally liable for facilitating sex trafficking or the exploitation of children would be transformative in the fight against human trafficking.

Maersk, which owns the world\u2019s biggest container operator, said Tuesday that it will enter a joint venture with International Business Machines Corp. IBM -0.86% to create a more efficient and secure platform for organizing global trade using blockchain technology.  The companies, which began collaborating on the new technology in 2016, said the new company\u2019s platform could be used to streamline operations for the entire global shipping ecosystem. Large companies such as DowDuPont Inc. already have piloted the platform.  The idea came from the current stack of paperwork needed to process and track the shipping of goods. Maersk said the maximum cost of the required trade documentation to process and administer many of the goods shipped each year is estimated to reach one-fifth of the actual physical transportation costs.

The companies said blockchain, the technology behind increasingly popular cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, is ideal for organizing large networks with different partners like the shipping industry, which transports more that $4 trillion goods a year.  \u201cThe potential from offering a neutral, open digital platform for safe and easy ways of exchanging information is huge, and all players across the supply chain stand to benefit,\u201d said Vincent Clerc, chief commercial officer at Maersk and future chairman of the board of the new joint venture.  More corporations, including General Motors Co. and Procter & Gamble Co. , have expressed interest in the platform and are exploring ways to use it to streamline supply chains and customs clearance. Singaporean and Peruvian customs also are exploring collaborating with the platform to facilitate trade flows and enhance supply chain security.  The move comes as Maersk and IBM have been attempting to reinvent themselves. IBM, the 106-year-old technology giant, has been looking to new lines of business including blockchain as sales in its legacy business of selling hardware and software slow. Maersk has been trying to transform itself to into a global supply-chain major like United Parcel Service Inc. and FedEx Corp. by integrating its transport and logistics units and spinning off its oil business.  The new company will be headquartered in the New York metropolitan area and led by former president of Maersk Line in North America Michael White.  Solutions from the joint venture are expected to become available within six months of regulatory clearance.

Robert Pittenger\u2019s \u201cHow China Pushes the Limits on Military Technology Transfer\u201d (op-ed, March 14): Few Americans would argue against measures to make this country more secure, and most would agree that protecting national security requires the proper tools. Still, many more would agree that being factual when discussing this topic is absolutely critical.  Legislation recently introduced in Congress and advocated in these pages by Rep. Robert Pittenger would make some needed improvements to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (Cfius). For example, the measure would expand the ability of the government to block the purchase of buildings or other real estate near military installations.  But Mr. Pittenger\u2019s bill\u2014the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act\u2014goes much, much farther. It would drastically expand the mission of Cfius, an interagency committee staffed by fewer than a dozen people at the Treasury Department, bringing under government review countless international sales and licensing transactions by U.S. companies.  The new remit of Cfius would include such things as standard computer service and support contracts, technology manuals needed to operate machinery purchased by foreign customers and even the licensing of trademarks. Technologies that never were deemed sensitive by the Defense Department or that were long ago removed from control by the U.S. and its allies would be subject to new and opaque regulation by Cfius.  More concerning is that Mr. Pittenger\u2019s bill would do all of this unilaterally\u2014without any effort at cooperation with our allies. The U.S. does not have a monopoly on innovative technologies. Congress can impose all the restrictions it wants on U.S. businesses. But, if America does not work with allies to enact similar controls, we will fail to protect both national security and our economic competitiveness.  In making his case to expand Cfius, Rep. Pittenger has misrepresented the facts. He cites examples of technology sold overseas by IBM and other companies that the U.S. government itself long ago ruled were nonsensitive and able to be freely sold around the world without a government license. In fact, everything IBM has done globally complies with U.S. and foreign export-control laws. For instance, sharing widely published, open-source software, or technology to assemble computer servers that are years behind state of the art, isn\u2019t threatening and therefore not legally controlled for export. But assisting with China\u2019s high-performance computing project is rightly prohibited by U.S. law, and the assertion that IBM has done so is flatly untrue.  Instead of putting thousands of nonsensitive transactions under review by a small committee that has neither the staff nor the experience to handle them, the better approach would be to update the export-control system we already have. A bipartisan bill introduced by Reps. Ed Royce and Eliot Engel, leaders of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, would modernize export controls to deal with emerging challenges.  Congress could also require that technology controls be kept up-to-date. The Departments of Commerce and State\u2014which are today responsible for administering controls on dual-use and military technologies\u2014have between them 500 experts, a transparent process of licensing and deep technical knowledge. But the Militarily Critical Technologies List, mandated by Congress as the baseline for what to control, hasn\u2019t been updated by the Defense Department since 2011.  As recent history has shown, controlling sensitive technology works best when done internationally, with a sharp focus on those technologies that are the most critical. Casting too broad a net on routine business risks losing focus on the real threats. Creating a new bureaucracy, instead of modernizing the one we already have, would be misguided.  Rep. Pittenger should get his facts straight. And Congress should act, both to improve Cfius and to update export controls, but it should use the proper tools for the proper job.  Christopher Padilla  IBM  Washington  Mr. Padilla is vice president for government and regulatory affairs at IBM. He was assistant secretary of commerce responsible for export controls from 2006-2007.  Rep. Pittenger\u2019s piece is premised on inaccurate claims about GE that undermine his arguments to reform government oversight of foreign acquisitions. We are a 125-year-old American company that has worked closely with the U.S. government and military for decades. Rep. Pettinger\u2019s insinuation that GE would compromise our national security to do business in China is offensive and untrue. While we, like many global companies, have joint ventures in China, all of them are consistent with U.S. law, and in many instances were established in close consultation with the U.S. government.  Rep. Pittenger never contacted GE to fact-check his allegations. In truth, GE supports Cfius reform, including strengthening the federal resources devoted to reviews of inbound investments and focusing the review on sectors of highest priority. What we don\u2019t support is the expansion of Cfius\u2019s jurisdiction to outbound U.S. investments into joint ventures around the world (not just in China). Doing so would set back both U.S. national security and economic interests, creating a new bureaucracy that is completely redundant with the existing U.S. export control system. It would generate thousands of additional cases for an already underresourced Cfius system, reduce the likelihood of a coordinated approach with our closest allies and needlessly damage American companies and their workers seeking to compete abroad.  Unfounded attacks like those made by Rep. Pittenger are unhelpful to the complex challenge the U.S. faces in safeguarding sensitive U.S. technology while enabling companies to compete in global markets. We will continue to work with the many lawmakers who are constructively wrestling with this important issue.

One of the most important such lenses is the impact of IT on business processes, that is, on how work is actually done across the various functions of an organization.  IT-driven business process has gone through three distinct phases. First came process automation in the early years of IT, where companies automated and improved their existing processes while leaving the underlying structure of the organization in place. Then came enterprise-wide process reengineering and management, where the job was to redesign the flow of work and integrate management of the various process within the enterprise. The third phase is now starting, focused on the processes and transactions that determine how institutions interact with each other around the world. Here, blockchain is set to play a role.  Automation, reengineering and integrated management of business processes have had a major impact on lowering the costs and improving the efficiency of transactions within a firm. But as we well know, the internet and globalization have significantly increased the volume of transactions and other interactions taking place among institutions around the world. The processes to manage the conduct of business among companies have not kept up with the economy\u2019s digital transformation, adding significant frictions and costs to their operations.  According to a 2016 IBM report, three major types of frictions predominate when conducting business among different institutions:  Information frictions: Participants in a transaction don\u2019t have access to the same information; the required information is not easily accessible; and security and privacy risks keep rising, \u2013 e.g., hacking, cybercrime, identity theft.  Interaction frictions: Intermediaries are needed to help deal with growing scale and complexity; transactions take longer due to arcane global processes; and a lack of trusted marketplaces in many economies around the world.  Innovation frictions: These include legacy systems, bureaucratic processes and institutional inertia; restrictive regulations that stifle innovation and change; and growing uncertainties and threats that make it harder to move forward.  Blockchains have the potential to significantly reduce these various frictions by bringing one of the most important and oldest concepts, the ledger, to the internet age. Ledgers constitute a permanent record of all the economic transactions an institution handles, whether it\u2019s a bank managing deposits, loans and payments; a brokerage house keeping track of stocks and bonds; a global company conducting business with its supply chain partners; or a government office recording births and deaths, the ownership and sale of land and houses, or legal identity documents like passports and driver licenses.  \u201cToday, transactions are recorded in multiple ledgers,\u201d noted the IBM report. \u201cEach one captures at best a moment in time and reflects the information held by a single party: Bank X purchased or sold a mortgage, for example. They don\u2019t record what happens next, what came before, or the role of others \u2013 partners, suppliers, consumers \u2013 in the transaction. Moreover, they\u2019re prone to human error and vulnerable to tampering. By contrast, distributed ledgers can be shared and updated in near real-time across a group of participants.\u201d  Blockchain technologies hold great promise for global supply chains ecosystems by increasing the speed, security and accuracy of financial and commercial settlements; tracking the supply chain lifecycle of any component or product; and securely protecting all the transactions and data moving through the supply chain. Blockchains provide an immutable, non-revocable record of all the transactions through the entire supply chain cycle, which will be of great help in the timely resolution of errors or disputes among supply chain partners.  In August, 2016 the World Economic Forum published an excellent report on The future of financial infrastructure, an ambitious look at how blockchain can reshape financial services. The report noted that blockchain technologies have the potential to transform the infrastructure and processes of the financial industry, bringing a diverse range of benefits including operational simplification, near-real time settlements among institutions, more accurate regulatory compliance and liquidity and capital improvements.  However, the report also warned that the evolution towards such a blockchain-based financial infrastructure and processes will take considerable time because it must overcome significant challenges. In particular, it will require the close collaborations of its various stakeholders around the world \u2014 including financial institutions, merchants and governments\u2013to develop the appropriate legal and regulatory frameworks.  This emerging third phase in the evolution of business process transformation is both promising and challenging, as we once more apply IT to make economies more efficient, this time involving the interactions of institutions and industries all around the world.

FILE PHOTO - Intel logo is seen behind LED lights in this illustration taken January 5, 2018. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illutration  The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that Intel\u2019s competitive concern about Broadcom\u2019s attempt to buy mobile chip rival Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) had led it to consider a range of acquisitions in response, including a bid for Broadcom.  In response to an inquiry about the Journal\u2019s report, Intel said it does not comment on \u201crumours or speculation\u201d related to mergers and acquisitions but that it is focussed on its previous acquisitions.  \u201cWe have made important acquisitions over the past 30 months - including Mobileye and Altera - and our focus is on integrating those acquisitions and making them successful for our customers and shareholders,\u201d Intel said in a statement to Reuters. Intel acquired autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye last year and acquired programmable chip maker Altera in late 2015.  Broadcom did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Shares of Broadcom rose 3.6 percent to $262.93 in after hours trade on Friday. Qualcomm and Intel each fell less than 1 percent, to $62.87 and $51.84, respectively.  Singapore-based Broadcom\u2019s $117 billion (84.49 billion pounds) bid for Qualcomm faces concerns by U.S. regulators worried about potential Chinese influence on the company and U.S. ability to influence the creation of the next generation of mobile networks, called 5G.  Qualcomm has sought assurances from Broadcom over potential antitrust issues.  Intel is mostly known for making chips that are the brains of personal computers and data centres, though it has made progress gaining smart phone manufacturing customers such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O).  If Broadcom buys Qualcomm, Intel would face a much bigger competitor, nearly equal to itself in market heft.  Broadcom and Qualcomm are worth close to $100 billion each and a combination would be the biggest tech deal ever. An Intel deal would be significantly bigger, since its market capitalisation alone is nearly $240 billion.  The Journal reported that Intel had been considering a Broadcom bid since late last year and was working with advisers, although the newspaper said one of its sources described a bid as unlikely given the complexity of the combination.  Still, antitrust consultant Linley Gwennap said Intel likely could convince regulators to allow it to take over Broadcom, despite the size, since the companies largely make different types of microchips.

Intel announced a new chip today, called the Intel Xeon D-2100 processor, to help customers who want to move computing to the edge. It\u2019s part of an effort by the chip giant to stay ahead of emerging technology trends like edge computing and the Internet of Things.  Computing at the edge has some unique space and power requirements that Intel has tried to address with this announcement. For starters, it provides a stand-alone system on a chip (SoC). This means everything you need is built into the chip including compute, networking and storage. It\u2019s also low power, which might be necessary to run an edge computing device without the benefit of a data center power structure.  In a blog post announcing the new chip, Jennifer Huffstetler, vice president and general manager of data center product management in the Data Center Group at Intel, pointed out the growing need for this type of architecture. \u201cBy expanding the capabilities of the data center outward to the network edge, solution providers can process more data closer to endpoint devices, reducing application latency and opening up a whole new world of potential services and experience,\u201d Huffstetler wrote.  She added that the SoC gives customers an \u201cintegrated, hardware-enhanced network, security and acceleration capabilities in a single package.\u201d The chip achieves all of this by packing a lot into a small package including up to 18 \u2018Skylake-server\u2019 generation Intel Xeon processor cores integrated with up to 100 Gbps of built-in cryptography, decryption and encryption acceleration. Intel calls this \u2018QuickAssist Technology.\u2019  The company sees this being particularly useful for new 5G technologies being developed for smartphones like augmented and virtual reality applications and autonomous driving. They also see it being useful for communications network use cases like virtual private networks and software-defined wide area networks and also certain cloud workloads that require processing close to the edge such as content delivery networks.  Intel has already built a partner network for the new chip with a variety of companies including Dell EMC, Ericsson, NEC, NetApp and Palo Alto Networks.  And if you\u2019re concerned about the impact of the Spectre and Meltdown exploits, Intel reports that it has built in the latest patches into the new chip. (Although it\u2019s worth noting that Intel had trouble with its initial attempts at patching the exploit.)", "stock": "INTC", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-07", "source": "techcrunch", "url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/02/07/intels-latest-chip-is-designed-for-computing-at-the-edge/"}, {"article": "Intel CEO Brian Krzanich was delighted to report that Intel had a record year in the company\u2019s quarterly earnings call with analysts yesterday. Of course, he also had to acknowledge the Spectre and Meltdown chip vulnerabilities revealed earlier this month in perhaps the ultimate good news-bad news moment.  Like any good salesman, Krzanich led with the good news. \u201c2017 was a record year for Intel and fourth quarter results were outstanding. Well ahead of the forecast we outlined in October, based on the strength on both our PC-centric and data-centric businesses.\u201d  Then came the not-so good news on Spectre and Meltdown, which he valiantly tried to sweep aside in his opening remarks. \u201cWe\u2019ve been around the clock with our customers and partners to address the security vulnerability know as Spectre and Meltdown. While we made progress, I\u2019m acutely aware that we have more to do, we\u2019ve committed to being transparent keeping our customers and owners appraised of our progress and through our actions, building trust,\u201d he said.  He added that the company is working on a more permanent solution for later this year. \u201cWe\u2019re working to incorporate silicon-based changed to future products that will directly address the Spectre and Meltdown threats in hardware. And those products will begin appearing later this year,\u201d he said.  For those of you not aware of Spectre and Meltdown, they are a series of serious chip vulnerabilities that affect many modern chips including Intel and its competitors. They could allow hackers to access the chip kernel, the area that is supposed to protect the most sensitive information like passwords and encryption keys.  What\u2019s more, the fixes to resolve, which have come in bunches from every corner of the tech world in recent weeks, could cause some significant computer processing slow-downs. It didn\u2019t help Intel\u2019s case that their first attempts at patching the issues were seriously buggy.  Nor did the fact that Google revealed that it had informed Intel In June 2017, months before it leaked out . In addition, Krzanich sold a substantial amount of stock in November, and filed the intent to sell long after he knew about the issue. Even though it was all legal, it certainly didn\u2019t look good.  In spite of all this, the fact is that Intel had a good quarter with revenue of $16.35 billion exceeding analyst\u2019s predictions, but that was for the period that ended 12/31/2017. The Spectre and Meltdown story broke on January 3rd.  Surprisingly only one analyst asked about the impact of Spectre and Meltdown on the company moving forward. Vivek Arya from Bank of America asked a question without mentioning the vulnerabilities by name. \u201cFor [the] first one, Brian, I\u2019m curious. Are you baking in any effect on sales of cost of pricing for many resolution on the processor security issues?\u201d Krzanich responded, \u201cFrom a cost standpoint, we\u2019ve baked in and we\u2019ve talked about that we don\u2019t expect any material impact of this security exploit on our spending or product cost or any of that. So that\u2019s how we baked that in.\u201d  It\u2019s worth noting that there are several lawsuits pending against Intel over the chip issues. Krzanich addressed that in his remarks. \u201cHowever, these circumstances are highly dynamic and we updated our risk factors to reflect both the evolving nature of these specific threats and litigation as well as the security challenge more broadly.\u201d  While acknowledging the obvious issues ahead, the company surprisingly doesn\u2019t see any substantial impact from the security problems. And in spite of all the negative news in recent weeks, the stock surged in after hours trading up $6.71 and was up slightly over that after the opening bell.  Whether Intel can escape from this unscathed financially remains to be seen, but at least for now Wall Street is not punishing the company for its transgressions, perhaps believing that Intel can resolve the chip security issues satisfactorily in the coming year.", "stock": "INTC", "label": 1, "date": "2018-01-26", "source": "techcrunch", "url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/01/26/intel-does-its-best-to-tamp-down-impact-of-spectre-and-meltdown-in-earnings-call/"}, {"article": "Game of Thrones may be out of season, but the complex and multi-dimensional strategic drama at the heart of the acclaimed series can still be witnessed in today\u2019s ongoing showdown between Broadcom and Qualcomm. This week, we even had a character \u201cdeath\u201d of one of the \u201croyals\u201d to boot.  For those who have not been paying attention to this epic match, Singapore-domiciled Broadcom has been running a proxy battle with U.S.-based Qualcomm for the past few months, a process that Qualcomm has put enormous efforts into resisting. The two companies are among the most important producers of semiconductors and mobile chipsets, and their combined market value would be in the hundreds of billions of dollars.  Mega-mergers happen occasionally, and hostile takeovers are also not rare. What makes Qualcomm vs. Broadcom unique though is the incredible amount of chess playing that is taking place not only by the two companies, but other companies and governments as well in a simultaneous strategic game for tech domination. Today, I want to highlight a series of those moves from this week, and what those moves portend going forward.  Intel\u2019s nuclear option  Intel is the second largest chipmaker in the world, having recently fallen behind Samsung as Jon Russell noted this January. Intel dominates the chipsets for personal computers, but it has struggled mightily to build an inventory of products targeting smartphones.  That gap has allowed companies like Qualcomm to dominate the market for smartphone chipsets, with recent reports indicating that the company receives 42% of all revenue from the market, with Apple trailing at 20% of the market and MediaTek with 14%. Intel has been barely a blip, which is why it announced just before Mobile World Congress a few weeks ago that it was going to invest heavily in 5G wireless technology going forward.  Today, Qualcomm and Huawei are the technology leaders in the emerging 5G market. While Intel has not executed well in wireless chips in the past, there is a plausible path forward for the company to compete with these two leaders and potentially earn itself a profitable spot at the top of the market.  However, Broadcom\u2019s potential takeover of Qualcomm could vastly complicate such efforts. Broadcom and Qualcomm\u2019s combined market cap could be ahead of Intel\u2019s $244 billion valuation, and if Broadcom were to sell off 5G assets to Huawei (a major point of contention here that is definitely not final), then Intel might have to compete with a deeply-resourced Huawei, a battle it would likely not win.  Intel is gearing up to launch what might be dubbed the nuclear option: a complete buyout of Broadcom. The Wall Street Journal reported on rumors Friday that Intel would take such a move, which would massively dwarf the company\u2019s previous largest acquisition of Altera for $16.7 billion. As the WSJ wrote, \u201cIntel is watching the takeover battle closely and is eager for Broadcom to fail [at acquiring Qualcomm] as the combined company would pose a serious competitive threat, the people said.\u201d  So now we have Intel expending all energy to block Broadcom\u2019s bid for Qualcomm, and also Intel considering a pre-emptive, $109 billion (at minimum!) price for Broadcom to prevent the tie-up if it absolutely had to. That\u2019s some very expensive chess moves right there for all of the companies involved.  Singapore, China and the United States enter the fight  Okay, so a company starts to get involved in an M&A process to prevent their competitors from merging and transforming into a more formidable opponent. That\u2019s pretty standard fare, but where the multi-dimensionality of this acquisition war starts to really become visible is the extent to which national governments are intervening to control the outcome.  The United States is doing the most here, through a government committee known as CFIUS, or the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (for those who missed my primer on CFIUS last week, definitely take a read). CFIUS is designed to protect U.S. national security by regulating foreign acquisitions of American companies, and therefore has taken a keen interest in the Broadcom vs. Qualcomm struggle.  In an extraordinarily rare public letter (the committee\u2019s thinking is almost always secret), CFIUS published its preliminary negative outlook on the hostile takeover. Quoting a key paragraph at length:  \u201cReduction in Qualcomm\u2019s long-term technological competitiveness and influence in standard setting would significantly impact U.S. national security. This is in large part because a weakening of Qualcomm\u2019s position would leave an opening for China to expand its influence on the 5G standard-setting process. Chinese companies, including Huawei, have increased their engagement in 5G standardization working groups as part of their efforts to build out a 5G technology. For example, Huawei has increased its R&D expenditures and owns about 10 percent of 5G essential patents. While the United States remains dominant in the standards-setting space currently, China would likely compete robustly to fill any void left by Qualcomm as a result of this hostile takeover. Given well-known U.S. national security concerns about Huawei and other Chinese telecommunications companies, a shift to Chinese dominance in 5G would have substantial negative national security consequences for the United States.\u201d  Broadcom has been trying to replace most of Qualcomm\u2019s board of directors, with a shareholder vote scheduled for this past week on March 6th. CFIUS asked that the vote be postponed 30 days in order for it to have more time to comprehensively evaluate the national security implications of the proposed transaction.  Originally, I and other analysts thought that CFIUS was responding to pressure from Congress to act unilaterally on the proposed deal. What we have learned though is that Qualcomm\u2019s board had secretly asked CFIUS to review the transaction on January 29th this year.  In other words, Qualcomm is using America\u2019s regulatory authority as a potential weapon to thwart Broadcom\u2019s bid and protect itself. It\u2019s a brilliant maneuver, and also fairly unprecedented: CFIUS is usually only engaged once both parties to a transaction have finalized a deal and submitted it for review.  China has its own regulatory weapon to fight back though. While dealing with the proxy battle with Broadcom, Qualcomm has also been trying to finalize its acquisition of NXP Semiconductors, which has been going on for a year now. It raised its offer price two weeks ago to $44 billion, an offer that looks like it is increasingly acceptable to NXP shareholders.  There\u2019s just one hang up: China\u2019s chief regulatory body overseeing the transaction, the Ministry of Commerce or MOFCOM, has yet to approve the deal, and it is the only international trade regulator that hasn\u2019t assented. Some M&A analysts are now saying that the approval process could be extended, not just as a response to CFIUS-related concerns, but also due to Trump\u2019s newly proposed steel and aluminum tariffs.  As I mentioned before, China-based Huawei and Qualcomm are the two market leaders for 5G. Harming Qualcomm then would fundamentally benefit Chinese interest, which is why China is also playing the economic security chess game.  Finally, we get to the Singapore connection. Despite having a majority of its employees and office space in North America according to an NYT Dealbook analysis, Broadcom is domiciled in Singapore, which makes it a foreign company in the eyes of CFIUS. Broadcom has floated a proposal to redomicile to the United States, which would potentially make it exempt from CFIUS (though there is serious debate on this point). CFIUS is clearly worried about losing jurisdiction, because it demanded Broadcom give the committee five business days notice before taking action on redomiciling.  Broadcom is taking action though, since it announced yesterday that it would ask shareholders to approve of a redomicile plan on March 23rd, and it disclosed that it had already discussed the plan with the Singapore courts at a hearing on March 9, which would have to approve the plan. So Singapore also has some regulatory leverage in the game as well, which is all the more complicated since it sits between China and the U.S. on many of the national security issues at the heart of this battle.  The demise of a \u201croyal\u201d and the future  If your head isn\u2019t spinning at all of these dynamics, add in one more: Qualcomm is struggling to overcome a malaise that has hit its share price over the past several years. Qualcomm\u2019s board can\u2019t just ignore Broadcom\u2019s offer, given that the premium being offered today is roughly 50% above its share price from before the proxy battle started.  The Qualcomm board announced this week that executive chairman Paul Jacobs, the former CEO of the company and the son of company founder Irwin Jacobs, would step down and the role eliminated. Jeffrey Henderson, a board director appointed by activist hedge fund Jana Partners, will become chairman of the board. The proxy battle has hit at the heart of the founding family of the company, and is clearly starting to take a more personal toll.  In a battle with so many actors and interests at stake, it is hard to prognosticate on what the outcome here is going to be. My analysis is that the Trump administration is going to attempt to maintain jurisdiction over the merger regardless of Broadcom\u2019s redomicile process, and will likely end up negative on the deal although it may not outright block it. Qualcomm also seems increasingly warm to offers from Broadcom to buy the company, and Qualcomm\u2019s desire to consummate a deal would certainly move the process more quickly forward.  Expect more hijinks and chess moves in the coming weeks as the final stages of this fight reach their crescendo. The season finale of this battle is still far away.", "stock": "INTC", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-10", "source": "techcrunch", "url": "http://techcrunch.com/2018/03/10/qualcomm-vs-broadcom/"}, {"article": "Ampere, a new chip company run by former Intel president Renee James, came out of stealth today with a brand-new highly efficient Arm-based server chip targeted at hyperscale data centers.  The company\u2019s first chip is a custom core Armv8-A 64-bit server operating at up to 3.3 GHz with 1TB of memory at a power envelope of 125 watts. Although James was not ready to share pricing, she promised that the chip would offer unsurpassed price/performance that would exceed any high performance computing chip out there.  The company has a couple of other products in the works as well, which it will unveil in the future  It takes a ton of money and some guts to launch a chip company, but James, who worked at Intel for 28 years, had the pedigree to pull in a highly experienced team of industry heavyweights to build the product. The company is being backed by The Carlyle Group, a private equity firm where James worked briefly after leaving Intel. She would not disclose the amount of funding, but did say her company was significantly well capitalized.  As for what motivated her to start a new company, she saw an opportunity to do something that had not had been done and she decided to pursue the challenge. \u201cYou\u2019re only done until the next great thing is done, then you\u2019re not done anymore,\u201d she said.  The opportunity James saw was workloads moving to the cloud that required a new generation of chip technology that was more efficient than those that had been created in the past.

The Democratic memo is said to contend that the F.B.I. was more forthcoming with the surveillance court than Republicans had claimed. Republicans allege that the bureau did not disclose to the court that information from a former British spy, Christopher Steele, that was used in the warrant application had been partly financed by the Democratic National Committee and lawyers for Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign.  People familiar with the document have said it also rebuts Republican claims that Andrew G. McCabe, the deputy director of the F.B.I. at the time, had told the Intelligence Committee late last year that the agency would not have sought a wiretap of Mr. Page without Mr. Steele\u2019s dossier of information.

But even though the president said the memo had vindicated him, in reality it did nothing to clear him of either collusion with the Russians or obstruction of justice \u2014 the lines of inquiry being pursued by Mr. Mueller. The memo in fact undermined some Republicans\u2019 efforts to cast doubt on the roots of the investigation by confirming that the inquiry was already underway before law enforcement officials presented the Steele information in obtaining the warrant to conduct surveillance on Mr. Page.  On Sunday, several Republicans on the Intelligence Committee distanced themselves from Mr. Trump\u2019s statements. Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina, who advised the Republican committee staff members who drafted the memo, said that he saw no substantive connection.  \u201cI actually don\u2019t think it has any impact on the Russia probe,\u201d he said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d He added, \u201cThere is a Russia investigation without a dossier.\u201d  Representative Brad Wenstrup, an Ohio Republican who also sits on the intelligence panel, echoed those remarks on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d  \u201cIn my opinion, what we\u2019re dealing with is a situation within our FISA court and how we process within our government agencies,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think it really has anything to do with that,\u201d he added, referring to the broader Russia inquiry.  The people familiar with the Democratic document say that it reveals that while the F.B.I. did not name the Democratic National Committee and Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign as having funded the Steele research, the bureau disclosed to the court that the information it had received from him was politically motivated. That, the Democratic memo says, gave the judge in the case the information he needed to make a decision about its usefulness.  The memo is also said to argue that Republicans distorted the testimony by Mr. McCabe, the F.B.I. official, and left out reams of other evidence included by the F.B.I. to support the bureau\u2019s suspicions that Mr. Page was acting as an agent of Russia. Mr. McCabe in fact presented the material as part of a constellation of compelling evidence that raised serious suspicions about Mr. Page, a former Moscow-based banker who had been on the F.B.I.\u2019s radar for years, according to those familiar with the memo.

It has been edited for content to reflect details related to the Middle East launch of Intel's new processors.  Intel is poised to continue its dominance of the mobile computing world in 2018 with the release of new Coffee Lake H-series and U-series Intel Core processors, Core i9 CPUs for laptops, and Intel Optane taking over mobile memory.  All three new types of product are designed to give Intel what it needs to deliver top-tier performance for every laptop price point, purpose and form factor \u2013 and based on Intel\u2019s promises and early hands-on time with several of these 8th-generation and Core i9 laptops, Intel seems well on its way to delivering.  Starting with the fun stuff, Intel Core i9 brings the firm\u2019s most powerful CPU into the mobile space. The one and only Core i9 processor is the i9-8950HK, clocked at 2.9GHz and maxing out at 4.8GHz across its six cores and 12 threads. The processor has a relatively massive 12MB cache, and is unlocked for overclocking.  Clearly, the idea with this processor is to bring desktop, hexa-core power to gaming laptops and prosumer devices. Laptops we\u2019ve seen already that possess this power include the Asus ROG G703, Dell XPS 15 (2018) and MSI GT75 Titan.  Image 1 of 8 Acer Aspire Nitro 5  Sporting a faux carbon fiber lid, the Acer Nitro 5 will be one of the more affordable Intel 8th-gen H-series laptops available starting this month. Image 2 of 8 Acer Aspire 7  Meanwhile, Acer's more business facing Aspire 7 brings the same level of performance to a more professional device plus higher-tier Nvidia GTX 1050 Ti graphics. Image 3 of 8 MSI GS65 Stealth  The MSI GS65 is fresh, more minimalistic take on the brand's classic Stealth series featuring an even thinner chassis and smaller bezels. Image 4 of 8 MSI GT75 Titan  On the opposite end of the portability equation, the MSI GT75 Titan is one of the first of three gaming laptops to feature an Intel Core i9 processor for true overclocking potential.  Image 5 of 8 Asus ZenBook Pro UX550  The Asus ZenBook Pro UX550 is one of the thinnest laptops that will features an H-series Coffee Lake processor  Image 6 of 8 Asus ROG G703  The Asus ROG G703 pairs up the new Intel Core i9-8950HK processor with Nvidia GTX 1080 for unparalleled performance in a gaming laptop. Image 7 of 8 HP Omen 15  The HP Omen 15 is not only of the brands first laptops to feature a hexa-core Intel Core processor, but also a Nvidia GTX 1060 Max-Q GPU. Image 8 of 8 HP Omen 17  Featuring the same choices in processors, the HP Omen 17 also sports a larger 17.3-inch screen.  Better performance for all  Unlike the laser focus on enthusiast gaming of Core i9 on mobile, Intel looks for its Coffee Lake H- and U-series to improve upon the experiences of all gamers and general users, respectively.  The H series of Intel Core processors brings hexa-core design to Intel Core i7 chips for the first time in the i7-8850H with a 2.6GHz clock speed that boosts to 4.3GHz when needed with a 9MB cache in tow. These hexa-core CPUs should make managing multiple units in strategy and other similar games much more efficient.  Intel\u2019s Coffee Lake U-series, however, simply doubles down on the power of 8th-gen Kaby Lake R with more quad-core chips that range in clock speed from 2.3GHz to 3.0GHz and cache size from 4MB to 8MB.  By Intel\u2019s measure using a Core i7 8th generation processors are 88% better in performance compared to a three year old system. The new U-series also integrates updated Iris Plus graphics.  To make those gains feel even greater, Intel has brought its Optane high-speed memory to laptops through both direct Optane SSDs, like the Optane SSD 800p, as well as Optane hybrid drives for disk drives paired with SSDs. According to Intel, the gains amount to 1.3x performance improvement in data writing and retrieval-related tasks, and 4.7x faster level loading in games.  Intel hasn\u2019t laid out pricing expectations for any products containing these new processors or storage improvements, leaving that up to individual device makers. Expect to see laptops with these new processors inside laptops very soon.", "stock": "INTC", "label": 1, "date": "2018-04-09", "source": "techradar", "url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/intel-details-new-core-i9-coffee-lake-and-optane-for-laptops"}, {"article": "When we first heard of Intel\u2019s H-series Coffee Lake processors for laptops, we had a hunch it would include some of company\u2019s first hexa-core CPUs. But, we never expected Core i9 to make the jump to laptops .  On desktops, high-end processors, like the Intel Core i9-7980XE , have brought the highest-core counts we\u2019ve seen on consumer chips and the greatest multi-core performance we\u2019ve tested.  In similar fashion, the top-of-the-line chip boasts a six-core and 12-thread arrangement for the first time on a mobile part, with the addition of higher clock speeds up to 4.8GHz, thanks to its fully unlocked status. Intel claims that its Core i9-8950HK is the best gaming and content-creation laptop processor it has ever built. Even amongst its 8th generation H-series brethren, this top-end part is claimed to deliver at least 10% more performance than the second-most powerful Intel Core i7-8850H.  Of course, there\u2019s always a greater story behind any legendary leap forward such as this, and Fredrik Hamberger, general manager of premium and gaming notebooks at Intel, is excited to tell all.  \u201cWe saw the demand from our highest-end enthusiasts for more performance,\u201d Hamberger says, explaining the origins of the first mobile Core i9 processor. \u201cThey wanted something more, different and higher-end than just what we were scaling with our entire category.\u201d  \u201cSo, we looked at that and we had an opportunity to squeeze a little more out of our process and by doing some unique things, like Thermal Velocity Boost.\u201d  Thermal Velocity Boost will require the best cooled notebooks  Going into overdrive  Just what is Thermal Velocity Boost (TVB) anyway? It\u2019s basically a feature that allows Intel\u2019s top-end processor to achieve an additional 200MHz of additional frequency on top its standard 4.6GHz Turbo Boost.  \u201cBy taking advantage of the fact that, at lower temperatures, you can actually achieve higher frequencies,\u201d Hamberger explains, \u201cwe\u2019ve done some tweaking to our process and microcode to enable an additional boost in frequency when the processor temperature allows. \u201c  Like most of Intel\u2019s Turbo Boost technology, Thermal Velocity Boost turns on automatically applies the 200 extra megahertz of additional frequency as long as a workload \u2013 such as a video encode or rendering 3D models \u2013 requires it and the chip is operating at 50-degrees Celsius or lower.  As Hamberger explains it, TVB is centered around burst workloads rather holding a sustained overclock for tasks such as gaming.  \u201cAs the part heats up, you might drop down to only 100MHz of additional frequency and when it reaches something above 70- or 80-degrees Celsius you might not get that any additional speed,\u201d Hamberger says.  Still, you can expect the chip to operate at its guaranteed turbo boost frequency of 4.6GHz up to 100-degrees Celsius. Any hotter than that, and you\u2019ll most likely have other problems on your hands.  Bringing desktop power to laptops  Following our talks with Intel, it is abundantly clear that the ultimate goal of its new Intel Core i9 chip is to bring the power of desktops to the laptop. The concept isn\u2019t exactly new to the mobile space: over the years, we\u2019ve seen plenty of manufacturers implement desktop processors into gaming laptops , such as the Origin EON15-X .  Intel, being the actual maker of the processors, wasn\u2019t about to just ramshackle a desktop-level part into a notebook. Rather, it engineered a chip completely designed for mobile with a thermal design and power delivery that notebooks could support.  \u201cWe saw the wish for power and performance and that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to deliver, giving them as much as we can in a mobile-friendly form factor,\u201d Hamberger tells us. \u201cYou get that better form factor, battery life and tuning that you wouldn\u2019t get with a socketed part in a notebook chassis.\u201d  \u201cIf you look at what we did with our highest-end performing SKU. The Core i9 is on par with last year\u2019s desktop chip.  The thinnest Intel Core i9-powered laptop  For the most part, Hamberger sees musclebook \u2013 a new phrase Intel has coined for thicker workstations and gaming notebooks \u2013 users being able to take the full advantage of Core i9\u2019s overclocking capabilities as they offer a higher level of cooling, allowing for TVB to kick in more often. That said, there will also be thinner laptops capable of supporting Intel\u2019s highest-end chip, such as the Dell XPS 15 .  \u201cIt\u2019s also going to show up in the sub 20mm category that has thinness and greater battery life than six hours,\u201d he says.  If you look at the history of silicon in computers, there\u2019s always been a trickle-down effect, especially in Intel\u2019s case. Intel Core i9, and the greater Core X series, brought server capability into a desktop format with megatasking.  Now, Intel Core i9 brings the performance of a desktop and server-borne megatasking to notebooks, all within the company\u2019s first hexa-core processors for laptops. Here\u2019s to hoping the trend continues and we see mobile CPUs with eight or more cores in the near future.", "stock": "INTC", "label": 1, "date": "2018-04-10", "source": "techradar", "url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/how-intels-core-i9-processors-will-inject-desktop-grade-power-into-future-laptops"}, {"article": "If you\u2019ve been holding out for Intel to finally meet AMD head-on with core-crammed PC processors for the mainstream, Coffee Lake won\u2019t disappoint you this year. Both VideoCardz and WccfTech have found evidence of octa-core Intel Coffee Lake S processors slated for post-June release.  Reportedly uncovered through leaks in benchmarking software maker Futuremark\u2019s 3DMark database, not much is known about these processors beyond base clock speeds, which could change, and the vastly more important core count. If all pans out, you\u2019re looking at Intel Coffee Lake S processors capable of driving eight cores at a 2.2GHz frequency with what appears to be a 16MB cache.  Of course, neither the processor\u2019s test scores nor more specific information is available at this time. Regardless, this is an excellent sign of Intel\u2019s intent to compete with AMD in the high-end mainstream processor space for gamers and other hobbyist consumers with money to burn.  Intel\u2019s no stranger to the core craze, but in mainstream?  Last year, we definitely saw Intel release an 18-core beast of a processor in the Core i9-7980XE , but that was based on Intel\u2019s larger 22nm architecture, as well as its X299 chipset and motherboard series, and cost nearly thousands.  On its more modern 14nm process, Intel was only able to get as far as hexa-core processors in 2017, led by the award-winning, Z370-based Core i7-8700K for more than a thousand less. While that was able to trounce AMD Ryzen \u2019s best in our tests, Intel clearly isn\u2019t about to let that momentum die out.  That\u2019s what makes this finding so significant, that octa-core Intel processors are within reach of prospective PC builders for prices that, while still exorbitant, aren\u2019t prohibitively so. However, it's expected that these new processors will be compatible only with the upcoming Intel Z390, also featured within this database leak \u2013 so it'll likely be a bit pricier to get in on these processors than just the cost of the chip.  According to these reports, we should expect to see Coffee Lake S land on shelves in the second half of 2018.", "stock": "INTC", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-21", "source": "techradar", "url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/intel-coffee-lake-s-8-core-processors-will-land-later-this-year-3dmark-leak-teases"}, {"article": "Microsoft said that its internal testing shows the patch will stop the rebooting until Intel gets a new update together. Intel had already recommended that customers stop deploying the original patch, but that's obviously impossible for individual Windows users, as the fixes come bundled in Microsoft's own security updates.  Intel dodged a bullet when its latest earnings report showed minimal financial impact from Spectre and Meltdown. However, it has been criticized by security experts over its lack of forthrightness about the scope of the problem. At one point, the chip maker had said the faulty patches only affect older CPUs, but later admitted that it can cause newer computers to reboot for no good reasons, too.  Intel took another knock over the weekend for reportedly disclosing Meltdown and Spectre to Chinese customers like Lenovo and Alibaba before it even told the US government. The concern was that the Chinese government could have found out about the vulnerability and exploited it. Meanwhile, Intel has promised to release new patches for Spectre and Meltdown soon, and said chips invulnerable to the problem are coming later this year.", "stock": "INTC", "label": -1, "date": "2018-01-29", "source": "engadget", "url": "https://www.engadget.com/2018/01/29/windows-spectre-meltdown-unpatching/"}, {"article": "Shenoy also discussed how the Spectre and Meltdown fixes will affect servers, staying true to Intel's promise to be more transparent. He revealed the initial data the company got from benchmarking server platforms using two-socket Intel Xeon Scalable -- its latest microarchitecture -- systems. It found that the fixes don't affect servers' energy efficiency and it didn't detect a slowdown when running Java business applications. However, it detected minimal impact of around 2 to 4 percent in some cases and saw significant slowdowns when it ran tests simulating different types of input/output (I/O) loads.  When it stressed the CPU to use 100 percent of its power to read data, it didn't see a decrease in speed. But when it tasked the system to use 100 percent of its power to write data, its speed decreased by a whopping 18 percent. In addition, when the company tested the system using tools for writing high performance, scalable, user-mode storage applications, it saw a 25 percent decrease in speed when only using a single core.  Intel says it's working with partners and customers to address the areas where it saw significant slowdowns.

It was cleverly spun. Mr. Boyd played up the access to the secondary information Mr. Nunes had demanded\u2014access to the application and renewals for the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants on one-time Trump associate Carter Page. Mr. Boyd describes his department\u2019s response as \u201cextraordinary accommodation.\u201d  Upon inspection, however, the focus on the FISA warrants looks more like an effort to distract attention from Mr. Boyd\u2019s refusal even to mention Mr. Nunes\u2019s main request of FBI Director Christopher Wray and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. That request was for the \u201celectronic communication,\u201d or memo, that officially launched the counterintelligence investigation into alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.  On Friday Trey Gowdy, an Intel Committee member who has seen a redacted form of the memo, said Justice has redacted the \u201cgood stuff.\u201d He means information that would tell whether the counterintelligence investigation was credible, and how and whether the FBI vetted the information. \u201cAll of that,\u201d Mr. Gowdy said, \u201cis in a paragraph I can\u2019t read.\u201d  Justice says the blacked-out paragraph can\u2019t be shared with Congress because it identifies a foreign country that shares intelligence with the U.S. This is a hard argument to credit, given that in December someone told the New York Times that Australian diplomat Alexander Downer was the source for the information that minor Trump campaign official George Papadopoulos had bragged about Russian dirt on Hillary Clinton. In February former CIA Director John Brennan referred to the FBI\u2019s relationship with British intelligence when asked about the information on Mr. Papadopoulos.  Mr. Nunes needs this information because it is crucial to understanding whether Justice and the FBI had good reason to launch this investigation\u2014and how they handled it. The Papadopoulos narrative matters to the FBI, because attributing the launch of the investigation to him minimizes the role of the now infamous Steele dossier.  Some suspect that the real reason Justice is keeping this paragraph secret is because it might reveal embarrassing facts about how the Papadopoulos information was used. This might include a role for political actors (rather than intelligence officials) in ginning up the Trump-Russia investigation.  Meanwhile, on Saturday President Trump asked in a tweet what \u201cJustice and the FBI have to hide\u201d? He added, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t they giving the strongly requested documents (unredacted) to the HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE?\u201d\u2014which has subpoenaed similar information about FBI actions during the 2016 election.  The President might ask the same about the stonewalling of the Intel Committee. Do Mr. Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions think that ignoring the committee\u2019s main request is in the spirit of the \u201cextraordinary accommodation\u201d that Mr. Boyd claims?

In a posting on its website last week, the BDS called on Netflix to \u201cnix \u2018Fauda\u2019,\u201d saying the series \u201cglorifies the Israeli military\u2019s war crimes against the Palestinian people.\u201d  \u201cFailing to do so will open Netflix to nonviolent grassroots pressure and possible legal accountability,\u201d the posting added.  Netflix declined to comment on Wednesday.  In its letter of support, the U.S.-based Creative Community for Peace called \u201cFauda\u201d a \u201cnuanced portrayal of issues related to the Israeli/Palestinian conflict.\u201d  \u201cWe want you to know that we stand behind you and Netflix in the face of this blatant attempt at artistic censorship,\u201d the letter said. Signatories included Universal Music Publishing Group Chief Executive Jody Gerson, Geffen Records president Neil Jacobson and Steve Schnur, music president at videogame producer Electronic Arts.  The campaign against \u201cFauda\u201d is the latest move since 2005 by BDS to promote a global cultural boycott against Israel.  It has succeeded in recent years in dissuading a number of music acts, including Pink Floyd frontman Roger Waters, Elvis Costello and New Zealand singer-songwriter Lorde, from performing in Israel.

REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo  At least 16 brokerages raised their price targets for the company\u2019s shares by as much as $72. Analysts at Bernstein were most bullish, setting targets of $302 compared to the $252 it traded at on Tuesday.  The video-streaming giant crossed $100 billion market value for the first time and was on track to add more than $10 billion if current prices hold.  In a statement after markets closed on Monday, Netflix said it added 6.36 million subscribers in international markets in the fourth quarter, beating analysts\u2019 expectations of 5.1 million, according to FactSet.  It now has 117.58 million streaming subscribers globally.  \u201cOverall, this was a \u2018home run quarter\u2019 for Netflix and should put any lingering worries to rest around sub(scriber) growth, international ramp, and the \u2018negative\u2019 possible effects from the (subscription) price increase,\u201d GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives said.  The company, which showcased popular returning series \u201cStranger Things\u201d, \u201cThe Crown\u201d and \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d in the quarter, in October hiked its monthly fees for U.S. customers for the first time in two years.  \u201cThe subscriber growth validates management\u2019s ongoing content investment, and should contribute to comfort with 2018\u2019s increased $7.5-8.0B content spend and associated marketing to support the content slate and ever-growing library,\u201d Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Graham said.  Netflix and its peers Hulu and Amazon.com Inc\u2019s (AMZN.O) Prime Video are steadily increasing budgets for producing original shows as they gain market share from traditional cable TV providers.  In contrast, U.S. wireless carrier Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) said on Tuesday that it lost a net of 29,000 Fios Video connections in the latest quarter, reflecting the shift from traditional linear video to over-the-top offerings.  Netflix spent $90 million on Will Smith action movie \u201cBright\u201d last year, its largest investment in an original film to date, and is already planning a sequel and additional investment in original films.  \u201cNetflix continues to prove out the thesis that Internet TV is replacing linear TV on a global basis,\u201d Evercore ISI analyst Vijay Jayant said.  Out of the 44 analysts that cover Netflix\u2019s stock, 27 now rate it at \u201cbuy\u201d or higher, 15 at \u201chold\u201d and two at \u201csell\u201d or lower. The median price target for the stock was $275.  Hulu ended 2017 with 17 million subscribers while analysts estimate Amazon\u2019s Prime service, which includes a free video subscription, has around 90 million customers.

The world\u2019s largest online TV network late Monday reported its strongest year of subscriber growth to date. Netflix added 24 million customers in 2017, bringing its global total to 117.6 million. For the final three months of the year, the Los Gatos, California-based company crushed Wall Street estimates and suggested it will continue to do so in 2018.  Media's Biggest Market Caps Netflix heads past $100 billion in market value after a blowout fourth quarter Source: Bloomberg data  While rival media companies merge, fire staff and fret about the future of their businesses, Netflix keeps chugging along, adding customers at home, in Europe and Latin America. Fourth-quarter sales grew by a third to $3.29 billion, the company said, while earnings almost tripled from a year prior to 41 cents, meeting estimates.  Netflix will plow all of that and more into new TV shows and movies. The company has said it will spend as much as $8 billion on programming this year, and disclosed Monday it will shell out another $2 billion for marketing. Netflix is also dramatically increasing its non-English programming, with plans to release 30 local language productions in 2018.  The shares rose as much as 13 percent to $257.71 in New York, marking a new high for the stock, which had already gained 19 percent this year through Monday.  Netflix signed up 8.33 million customers in the fourth quarter, surpassing analysts\u2019 estimates of 6.34 million, thanks in large part to the popularity of the fantasy series \u201cStranger Things\u201d and the new Will Smith movie \u201cBright.\u201d  That success has inspired Facebook Inc., Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. to try their hand at original programming. It has also spurred rivals like Walt Disney Co. to invest more in online services and acquire competitors. Yet Netflix enjoys a head start on all those players.  International Gains  International territories accounted for the bulk of the subscriber growth and hold the key to Netflix\u2019s future, with additions of 6.36 million topping the 5.05 million average of analysts\u2019 estimates. Netflix said Rodolphe Belmer, the chief executive officer of Paris-based Eutelsat Communications SA, will join its board.  The U.S. business, where growth had been slowing, also showed vigor. The company signed up 1.98 million new customers at home, up from a year ago and beating analysts\u2019 projections of 1.29 million, according to Bloomberg data.  Netflix churns out a wide range of new shows every month to entice new viewers and keep old ones. In the latest quarter it also released \u201cThe Crown,\u201d the first season of David Fincher\u2019s \u201cMindhunter\u201d and its first original German series, \u201cDark.\u201d  \u201cIn only five years since launching our first original series, Netflix had three of the top five most searched TV shows globally for the second year in a row,\u201d the company said in its letter to shareholders.  Netflix expects to add 6.35 million customers in the first quarter, more than the average 5.18 million projection of analysts. That includes 1.45 million new subscribers in the U.S.  Quarterly Profit  Splurging on new shows comes at a cost. Netflix will burn through as much as $4 billion in cash this year and said it will borrow again. Critical analysts continue to wonder when spending will level off. The company has stayed around break even for most of its existence, but continues to need cash because of lavish spending on programming.  Long-term debt stood at $6.5 billion at year-end, while long-term content liabilities totaled $3.33 billion.  The ability to raise prices could boost Netflix\u2019s profitability in the long-term. The company\u2019s October price increase -- $1 a month for the most popular plan -- had little impact, if any, on growth in the quarter. While a previous increase slowed subscriber gains, this one passed with less scrutiny or media coverage.

To be the first to know, please click here.  As Netflix continues to ramp up its annual content investment, the streamer has effectively changed the paradigm for content producers in a way that both expands and limits opportunities for producers and studios as well as for rival networks competing for the best content and talent, per Digiday.  Netflix CFO David Wells said recently that in 2018, Netflix will spend $8 billion and produce 700 pieces of original content, including 80 full-length original movies and 80 foreign-language original productions from local international territories where Netflix operates.  Thanks to its massive spending, Netflix has created a seller's market for producers and studios. Here are some of the fundamental ways that the new paradigm initiated under Netflix has benefited content producers:  There are more opportunities to sell content because Netflix is such a major buyer. In addition to buying more shows than other platforms and networks, Netflix also buys more episodes.  Netflix pays producers more money upfront than other programmers.  Netflix is mostly hands-off once it agrees to buy a piece of content, and will largely give producers creative free rein over their projects.  Netflix shows and movies can still be recognized in traditional modes, for example, with critical acclaim or awards.  Yet the new environment also potentially hurts producers:", "stock": "NFLX", "label": 1, "date": "2018-04-03", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/netflix-changes-the-paradigm-for-producers-2018-4"}, {"article": "Netflix\u2019s original content ramp is showing no signs of slowing own \u2013 in fact, if anything, it\u2019s speeding up. Netflix CFO David Wells says that the streaming company wants to have somewhere around 700 original shows and movies on the service in 2018, using that previously revealed budget of around $8 billion earmarked for original content.  Wells, speaking at Morgan Stanley\u2019s tech, media and telecom event (via Variety) explained that the new shows and movies that Netflix is creating is doing its intended work \u2013 adding new subscribers to the platform. Since people continue to sign up on the back of new content, the company\u2019s belief is that it should continue to produce it, through Wells also qualified that it\u2019s still not solely committed to one approach or another when it comes to content acquisition.  700 original shows and movies is a lot, but it makes sense when you look more closely at the frequency with which Netflix is releasing now original programming these days. It\u2019s also building a lot more international original productions, too, including 80 set for this year.  You do start to wonder about how quality can be maintained when you\u2019re aiming for that much original programming in that span of time. The answer, though, might actually be that quality isn\u2019t really as important a factor as you might expect.  Netflix got a lot of ribbing for its original holiday movie slate this year, for instance, which included Hallmark channel style fare.

Squeezed by Facebook and Google on one side, and impossible consumer expectations created by Netflix, Amazon and other streaming services on the other, the idea of an ad-supported entertainment business is under siege.  This chart from the analyst firm MoffettNathanson shows just how grim the situation is for companies not named Google or Facebook.  But in a wide-ranging conversation at the Code Media conference in Huntington Beach, Calif., the top executives of Turner and A+E Networks elaborated on how their app businesses and investments in startups are driving new growth.  While it\u2019s not a revelation that apps are a great way to make money and build a deeper relationship with consumers, and that technology is the future for networks (frankly the tech companies that have overrun Hollywood in the past few years are a stark example of this new reality), the success of Turner\u2019s Boomerang service and the investments that A+E has made in companies like Atlas Obscura and Vice highlight alternative ways to make money (I\u2019m also looking at you, Vox and Recode).  Turner launched Boomerang last year as a subscription service for cartoons in a joint venture between Cartoon Network and Warner Brothers. The app now counts roughly 150,000 subscribers, according to Turner chief executive John Martin. Martin also said the company was seeing success with its FilmStruck service, which leverages the Turner Classic Movies brand to offer a curated slate of movies to watch.  Martin said FilmStruck \u201cprovides a learning experience into what the future of this business is going to be, which is tapping into fandom.\u201d  For Martin, the idea of curation is going to be increasingly important as the amount of available distractions and stories explodes across different media properties. If the future of Turner is, as Martin says, \u201cbeing responsible for controlling the consumer experience from start to finish,\u201d then guiding people to apps where Turner can control that experience just makes sense.  Meanwhile, A+E has leveraged its investments in Atlas Obscura and Vice to provide new types of marketing dollars and open the network to an entirely new audience, according to chief executive Nancy Dubuc.  Dubuc pointed to the company\u2019s investment in Atlas Obscura as being a great way to move its audience from television at the History Channel, through Atlas Obscura to experiential marketing campaigns for a credit card company like American Express that would give benefits to new applicants.  Dubuc also said that Vice Media has been a success for the company. \u201cVice came to be around converting a channel so that you can reach a millennial audience,\u201d Dubuc said of the A+E decision to convert its H2 channel over to Viceland.  \u201cThey have the second most upscale audience to Bravo,\u201d Dubuc says of the Viceland channel. While the channel hasn\u2019t seen tremendous subscriber growth, it\u2019s reaching an audience of 18-34-year-old males with household incomes over $60,000, she said.  Those numbers will appeal to any marketer.  Nor are the two networks alone in looking to technology for returns. According to people with knowledge of the situation, that\u2019s one of the reasons why Fox bought TrueX four years ago \u2014 to improve the experience for consumers watching ads online.  \u201cPutting aside the investments in other companies, it\u2019s about having deep relationships with consumers however you get there,\u201d says one technology exec at a major studio. \u201cHaving an app on somebody\u2019s phone is perhaps the best way to get there\u2026 There\u2019s a fundamental thesis there.

It seems dramatic, but in a wonderful way in the arms of Rita Moreno, it has that diva turn.  A colleague of mine has written about how the show has this wonderful sense of joy. It feels like a celebration of Cuban culture, Latino identity, the immigrant experience and family. Is that a conscious choice when writing?  Well, that\u2019s just my experience. Really, my house is not a sad place ever. We feel so blessed, we feel so grateful. We have a really good time. In the media, Latino families are always in crisis \u2014 there\u2019s gang violence, people weeping. That\u2019s just not what I know it to be. I wanted to reflect my experience, too, and to throw that in the ring. It seems a lot of people relate to that, too.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Last season, you addressed immigration with Elena\u2019s friend Carmen and her parents\u2019 deportation. This time, you have Lydia and Schneider (Todd Grinnell) going through the citizenship process. Was that something you wanted to keep exploring?  In my family, not all of the Cubans became citizens. My parents became citizens, but I have aunts and uncles who did not. When you become a U.S. citizen, you have to renounce your Cuban citizenship. They\u2019re green card holders \u2014 they pay taxes, social security and they can\u2019t vote. When Trump started deporting people, my cousins got really concerned. \u201cShould we have mom become a citizen?\u201d There was all this worry. What if Lydia had never become a citizen? Then it would be fun to have her and Schneider go on that journey together.  Another story line you kept exploring this season was Penelope\u2019s depression, and how she\u2019s still struggling with the social stigma and the need to rely on antidepressants to help her.  We really wanted to get that right. It also seemed like something veterans really struggle with; Latinos have a lot of issues with discussing it or going on medications. We wanted to explore what that was like for this character. Also, she\u2019s at a great point in her life, so it\u2019s that placebo of \u201cEverything is going great, and I don\u2019t need to do any of this stuff anymore.\u201d Then, we saw what the reality of that looked like for her. She couldn\u2019t talk to her mom about it, and she couldn\u2019t talk to her boyfriend about it because she was embarrassed. It was also a way to deepen her relationship with Schneider because he was the only person she could talk to about it.  Is there a story you\u2019re looking forward to continuing in Season 3?  Well, we have a few things built in already. Penelope is in school, so she still will be in school, or maybe graduate. We get to see her journey to being a nurse practitioner. Seeing what else is out there for her dating life as well. Deepening Elena\u2019s relationship. Maybe Alex will get to have a little love in his life. And of course, we\u2019ll be taking into consideration what's happening in the next month or two months from now.

Not long after unveiling thousands of hours of new UHD content and Spotify integration, Sky has now announced a new partnership with Netlifx.  This new partnership will see the Netlix app integrated into Sky Q, as well as the creation of a brand-new Sky TV package that will include the full Netflix service.  If you're an existing Sky and Netflix customer you'll be able to open the app on your Sky Q box and sign into your Netflix account as you would on any other device. This will, of course, mean your Netflix and Sky accounts remain separate, and you'll be paying the same separate monthly fees.  Partners in entertainment  If you want to bring your subscriptions into one package, you'll have to move onto the new Sky TV bundle that has Netflix included as part of the overall package, and then cancel your existing Netflix subscription.  The agreement also extends to Sky's no-contract Now TV streaming devices, which will soon have their own standalone Netflix app. However, the deal won't be available to Sky+ customers, and it won\u2019t be possible to watch Netflix shows on the Sky Q app.  Although the agreement has been announced, the new Sky TV pack and Netflix app won't launch on Sky Q until later \"in the coming year\" in the UK and Ireland. No prices for the new bundle have been announced yet; they'll be confirmed closer to the launch.  The integration is a boon to users of both services, not only because it allows you to watch Netflix on your Sky Q box without having to switch to a different source, but because it also brings Sky\u2019s built-in text and voice search into Netflix.

He and his cast sampled the Mexican staple everywhere from the Yucat\u00e1n to Copenhagen.  One of his favorite tacos came from a food truck in L.A. It featured ingredients usually associated with the Middle East\u2014shawarma (meat sliced from a turning spit) and a thick, pitalike flour tortilla. In the show, he traced the history of these \u201cArab tacos\u201d back to the city of Puebla, about 80 miles southeast of Mexico City. There, Mr. Chang learned, immigrants from the Middle East helped to create the tacos decades ago.  He came across plenty of other cross-cultural connections in exploring other iconic dishes for the show. In Houston, he tasted Viet-Cajun crawfish, a combination of a New Orleans Creole dish with Vietnamese seasoning. In Italy, he noted how much tortellini look like wontons. \u201cEvery type of food came from somewhere else,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that just sprouted from someone\u2019s head.\u201d  Mr. Chang, 40, is best known for founding the Momofuku Group, with over a dozen Asian-inspired restaurants around the world, as well as six locations of the fast-casual chain Fuku and 13 Milk Bar dessert stores. He\u2019s still expanding his restaurant empire, which offers indulgent, sometimes oddball dishes such as kimchi bacon burgers and his much-imitated barbecued pork-belly buns. The chef and his restaurants have won five James Beard Awards, and one of the New York locations, Momofuku Ko, has carried two Michelin stars since 2009.  \u201cI think Momofuku has always tried to be a merger of things that don\u2019t always go together,\u201d Mr. Chang says. As for his show, \u201cwhen you say the word \u2018ugly delicious\u2019 it made sense.\u201d Many of his favorite dishes, such as curries and noodles, look ugly, he says.  The show\u2019s eight thematic episodes range from fried chicken to pizza to barbecue. The series asks why some cultures and not others readily assimilate new foods and dishes from afar. An area\u2019s tradition and its immigration history are major factors, Mr. Chang discovered. New Orleans, he found, was hesitant to accept new flavors and experimentation, in part thanks to a proud Creole culinary past. Houston, on the other hand, embraced waves of immigrants and their cooking techniques.  Mr. Chang now appreciates his own culture more, he says, partly because he \u2018ran away from it to begin with.\u2019 Photo: Austin Hargrave for The Wall Street Journal  For Mr. Chang, such stories have a strong personal resonance. The son of Korean immigrants, he grew up outside of Washington, D.C., in suburban Virginia. His mother made fried rice and chicken soup and his grandmother would make Korean dumplings, he remembers. His father used to take him to local pho and ramen spots, where Mr. Chang would watch in wonder as the chefs worked the dough and pulled it into long strands. \u201cThat\u2019s how my dad expressed love to me, by going out to eat,\u201d he says.  His parents were in the restaurant business for a time, but their two establishments served American fare\u2014 salads, soups and steaks. Mr. Chang never thought he would grow up to be a chef. \u201cI knew restaurants were in my dad\u2019s blood,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand until later that it could be a profession.\u201d  Mr. Chang was a champion golfer in high school, and his father wanted him to try being a professional, but he didn\u2019t enjoy the sport. Unsure of a career, he spent two years after college teaching English in Japan, where he fell in love with the local ramen shops. He kept copious notes of what he saw there, right down to the flavorings in the first slurp of soup.  When he returned to the U.S., he took a desk job in finance\u2014and hated it. He quit after six months and enrolled at the French Culinary Institute (now the International Culinary Center) in New York, with stints afterward at high-end restaurants in the city such as Craft and Caf\u00e9 Boulud.  When he finally decided to strike out on his own, it was to embrace the Asian food of his childhood: \u201cI think part of it is accepting being me.\u201d He now appreciates his own culture more, he says, partly because he \u201cran away from it to begin with.\u201d  In 2004, Mr. Chang started Momofuku Noodle Bar as a casual ramen spot. In six months, once he adjusted the menu to his liking, lines started forming out the door. His restaurant empire has expanded relentlessly since then.  Critics heaped praise on Mr. Chang\u2019s early restaurants but have not been as enthusiastic about one recent venture. A 2016 review of his new Italian-inflected restaurant by New York Times food critic Pete Wells was headlined: \u201cDavid Chang\u2019s Magic Shows a Little Wear.\u201d  Mr. Chang responded to the review in a New Yorker profile of Mr. Wells, saying, \u201cHe\u2019s being a [expletive] bully.\u201d These days, Mr. Chang thinks that customer reviews on services such as Yelp carry just as much weight as the opinions of professional critics.  Mr. Chang has experienced some failures as his business has expanded. Last year, he attempted to launch his own meal-preparation and delivery service, and a few years before that he invested in another. Both have since closed. Mr. Chang has said that delivery services were difficult to get right.  But the chef is still creating new concepts for restaurants and figuring out where to start them. Majordomo, which opened earlier this year in L.A., offers creative takes on basics and recently included short ribs with beef rice and shiso rice paper, and macaroni and chickpeas with black pepper.  Mr. Chang remains committed to experimenting and expanding. \u201cIt\u2019s this giant thing, and I don\u2019t know how it grows, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s going to grow.\u201d But he worries, too: \u201cEvery day feels like it\u2019s all going to end simultaneously.\u201d  Write to Alexandra Wolfe at alexandra.wolfe@wsj.com", "stock": "NFLX", "label": 1, "date": "2018-04-07", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/david-changs-culinary-mash-ups-1523030104"}, {"article": "Here are some of the companies with shares expected to trade actively in Tuesday\u2019s session.

Image: Netflix/Beta Films  The roaring 1920s are given a German twist in \u201cBabylon Berlin,\u201d a lavish television series that chronicles the social turmoil leading up to the Third Reich.  It premiered last October in Germany and became one of the country\u2019s most-watched shows, just behind the seventh season of \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d On Tuesday it begins streaming in the U.S. via Netflix , with subtitles. The show\u2019s depiction of crime, corruption and political unrest led German newspaper Die Zeit to note its \u201calmost eerie parallels to the present.\u201d  \u201cAt the time people did not realize how absolutely unstable this new construction of society which the Weimar Republic represented was,\u201d says series co-director Tom Tykwer. \u201cIt interested us because the fragility of democracy has been put to the test quite profoundly in recent years.\u201d  Hitler\u2019s name is only mentioned once during the German-language show\u2019s first season, and then only when he is referred to as a joke candidate. In the German federal election of 1928, Nazis won a mere 2.6% of the vote. Five years later, they took 44%.  Tom Tykwer previously directed \u2018Run Lola Run\u2019 and other films before tackling \u2018Babylon Berlin.\u2019 Photo: Axel Schmidt/REUTERS  Based on novels by the German crime writer Volker Kutscher, \u201cBabylon Berlin\u201d cost about $40 million, making it one of the most expensive German TV series ever made, according to a spokeswoman for Beta Film, which sold the series in 60 countries. It is also the first German co-production between a public broadcaster, ARD, and a private one, Sky, she said.  Co-written and co-directed by Mr. Tykwer and fellow German filmmakers Henk Handloegten and Achim von Borries, the show required 180 days of shooting, nearly 300 locations, 5,000 extras and features a jazzy soundtrack from Bryan Ferry. It stars 37-year-old Volker Bruch \u2014one of the leads in the Emmy-winning \u201cGeneration War\u201d\u2014as Gereon Rath, a haunted, self-medicating police commissioner from Cologne who is transferred to the vice squad in Berlin, a city he knows little about.  \u201cFrom the first day the city swallows him up in a big breath,\u201d says producer Stefan Arndt, who helped develop the show. \u201cCologne is old-fashioned, while in Berlin there\u2019s sex, drugs and women with short hair.\u201d  One of these women is Charlotte Ritter (Liv Lisa Fries) who supports her impoverished family by working as an archivist for the police by day and a prostitute by night. Her dream is to become the first woman to be employed as a detective in the all-male Berlin police force.  Liv Lisa Fries plays Charlotte Ritter in \u2018Babylon Berlin.\u2019 Photo: X Filme Creative Pool  \u201cBy 1929, new opportunities were arising,\u201d says Mr. Tykwer, whose fast-paced direction is reminiscent of his 1998 breakout film \u201cRun Lola Run.\u201d \u201cWomen had more possibilities to take part in society, especially in the labor market as Berlin became crowded with new thinking, new art, theater, music and journalistic writing.\u201d  Nonetheless Mr. Tykwer says that he and his co-directors were determined not to idealize those days. \u201cPeople tend to forget that it was also a very rough era in German history,\u201d the 52-year-old director says. \u201cThere was a lot of poverty, and people who had survived the war were suffering from a great deal of trauma.\u201d  Mr. Rath\u2019s first case when he arrives in Berlin is to bust a pornography ring whose members have been covertly filming prominent public figures having sex with prostitutes. The show also examines police brutality toward communists in the Weimar Republic and the stealthy, post-World War I buildup of a secret army that is far greater than the one permitted by the Treaty of Versailles.  \u201cFrom an historical perspective the series is very acute in showing how Weimar democracy was under attack both from the communist left, as well as by traditional conservatives, in a kind of unholy alliance,\u201d says Thomas Weber, a German historian not involved with the show but whose 2010 book \u201cHitler\u2019s First War\u201d is in development as a TV series.  By the end of season two of \u201cBabylon Berlin,\u201d which has already aired in Germany, the Nazi Party is beginning to make its xenophobic presence felt, as citizens grow disillusioned with the Weimar Republic\u2014a period Mr. Weber sees as mirrored in Germany today with the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany party.  The AfD has rejected any comparison with the Nazi party. But it is robustly anti-immigration and some of its leaders have called for a reassessment of 20th-century German history.  On Netflix, the two eight-episode seasons of \u201cBabylon Berlin\u201d are joining other foreign-language shows available to U.S. subscribers, including France\u2019s \u201cThe Frozen Dead,\u201d South Korea\u2019s \u201cBlack\u201d and Spain\u2019s \u201cLa Casa de Papel.\u201d  Mr. Handloegten says that the show\u2019s third season, currently being written, will encompass the 1929 stock market crash, which was devastating to Germany\u2019s working class.  \u201cOne of the main reasons to make \u2018Babylon Berlin\u2019 was to show how all these Nazis did not just fall from the sky,\u201d he says. \u201cThey were human beings who reacted to German society\u2019s changes and made their decisions accordingly.\u201d  Write to Tobias Grey at wsje.weekend@wsj.com", "stock": "NFLX", "label": 1, "date": "2018-01-27", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-hit-drama-in-germany-babylon-berlin-crosses-the-atlantic-1517054137"}, {"article": "(Reuters) - Nvidia Corp said on Tuesday China\u2019s Chery Automobile Co [CHERY.UL] would use its self-driving technology that it has developed with Baidu and ZF Friedrichshafen AG [ZFF.UL].

Nvidia\u2019s shares closed down 7.8 percent at $225.52, wiping out more than $11 billion in market value.  Nvidia shares have more than doubled in value in the past 12 months on bets that the company will become a leader in chips for driverless cars, data centers and artificial intelligence.  Uber suspended North American tests of its autonomous vehicles after the fatal collision on March 18 in Tempe, Arizona. And Arizona on Monday suspended permission for Uber to test self-driving vehicles on public streets.  The California Department of Motor Vehicles said on Tuesday that Uber indicated it would not renew its current permit to test autonomous vehicles in California.  Under current terms, Uber is allowed to test autonomous vehicles on California public roads until March 31.  Uber should be given a chance to understand what went wrong, Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said at the company\u2019s annual GPU Conference in San Jose, California. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what happened.\u201d  In addition, Huang said he expected investments in self-driving technology would rise, not fall, in the aftermath of the Uber fatality.  Nvidia leads the autonomous industry with its artificial intelligence platform and has partnered with major global automakers such as Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), Tesla Inc and Audi AG.  Nvidia has been conducting testing of self-driving cars around the globe, including in Santa Clara, California; New Jersey, Japan and Germany,  \u201cOur global fleet of manually driven data collection vehicles continue to operate,\u201d a company spokesman said.  Reuters earlier on Tuesday reported about the test suspension, citing a source.  \"Nvidia has no choice but to take steps in the context of the fear, uncertainty and outrage likely to be stimulated by a robot car killing a human being,\" Roger Lanctot, an automotive technology analyst with Strategy Analytics, wrote in a blog post bit.ly/2GaIBCN on Tuesday.  The Nvidia DRIVE platform is used by over 370 companies developing self-driving technology, including automakers and robotaxi companies and makers of self-driving hardware, such as sensors, Huang said on Tuesday.  Analyst Kinngai Chan from Summit Insight Group said he does not expect the suspension to hurt Nvidia\u2019s earnings.  The question is whether it would be one or two years before fully autonomous vehicles are ready, Chan said, adding if it is pushed out further then the multiple for stock needs to come down as the valuation is very high.  Nvidia trades at 37.60 times forward 12-month earnings, compared with 18.92 for its peer group.

After all, the portfolio manager of the $4.5 billion Wells Fargo Growth Fund beat 93 percent of peers over the past year by piling into Amazon.com Inc. and Google\u2019s parent Alphabet Inc. But between Facebook Inc.\u2019s privacy scandal and the back-to-back fatal crashes at Uber Technologies Inc. and Tesla Inc., the tech-sector doubters are suddenly speaking out as one stock after another slides.  Ognar is unmoved: \u201cWe don\u2019t think the party is over.\u201d Nor do the bulk of his fund-manager peers, as it turns out. Behind the ugly headline losses -- including the FANG complex\u2019s worst-ever day on Tuesday -- there are data points that suggest that many funds are a long way from abandoning the industry that has added more to the wealth of U.S. stock investors over the past five years than any other. What\u2019s more, the Nasdaq 100 Index is actually the only major U.S. stock benchmark still in the green this quarter.  \u201cThink of things like your thermostat that used to be pretty basic and analogue. Now you can control them with your phone,\u201d said Ognar from his office in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin. \u201cYour coffee machine, your coffee maker -- it\u2019s a huge secular shift that hopefully will continue to put up sustainable growth.\u201d  The stance on Wall Street strikes a discordant note with the backlash building in Washington. While it\u2019s too early to say whether Facebook\u2019s woes will lead to meaningful losses in users and advertisers, the drumbeat for tighter regulation has some wondering if it\u2019s a watershed moment for an industry that promised to change the world for the better.  \u201cYou have the darlings of growth stocks that are going through some tough times, and it\u2019s not going to be a short and quick story,\u201d said Jennifer Ellison, a principal of San Francisco-based Bingham, Osborn & Scarborough, which manages $4.2 billion. \u201cThis is a tip of that iceberg.\u201d  Even Amazon, largely shielded until now, was hammered on Wednesday by talk of a tougher government stance. Axios reported that U.S. President Donald Trump is contemplating ways to \u201cgo after\u201d the e-commerce giant, including whether to wield tax or antitrust legislation. The shares were down 2.1 percent Thursday as of 10:34 a.m. in New York, while the Nasdaq 100 climbed 0.5 percent.  Trump features again when it comes to Apple Inc. shares, which are more than 8 percent off their record high partly on concerns about the prospect of a trade war between the U.S. and China. In a worst-case scenario, the U.S. could impose a tariff that affects iPhones and other Chinese-manufactured electronics. And car accidents have roiled market darlings Tesla Inc. and Nvidia Corp.  Not to worry, say analysts, who\u2019ve flooded email inboxes with reports reaffirming a bullish stance on the broader industry. The bull case? Tech fundamentals remain strong and, for all the worry over privacy, fake news and tech power, the U.S. giants are still cranking out products that people want to buy.  Facebook is sitting on a pile of cash so big that fines equaling the largest corporate penalties ever would amount to less than 7 percent of it. Alongside Google, its online dominance is so complete that there are few alternatives for users or advertisers.  Scarred, Intact  \u201cThey\u2019ll come out bruised and scarred but they\u2019ll come out intact,\u201d said James Cakmak, an analyst at Monness Crespi Hardt & Co. who has maintained his buy rating and $210 price target on Facebook. \u201cRadio and TV aren\u2019t the future, we know that, digital is. And it\u2019s not going to affect the direction of the dollars, which is toward Google and Facebook. The question is what is the speed that they get there.\u201d  The damage to all these stocks over the past couple weeks remains contained if viewed through a wider lens. Even after Tuesday\u2019s 7 percent rout, Nvidia\u2019s stock is double where it was a year ago. Tesla, while losing almost a fifth of its value this year, is still up sevenfold from the start of 2013.  Analyst estimates and fund flows show few signs of panic. In fact, profit forecasts for the tech industry have been barely changed over the past two weeks despite the market turmoil. At 30 percent, the expected pace of growth exceeds all but one industry in the S&P 500 Index.  Investors in ETFs seem in no rush to bail. Take the PowerShares QQQ Trust Series, the biggest fund tracking the Nasdaq 100. Outflows peaked around $2 billion on March 19 and trickled down to less than one-tenth of that amount Tuesday, a day when Nasdaq companies lost $260 billion in market value.  \u201cTech has given us more than it has taken away,\u201d said Kim Forrest, senior portfolio manager at Fort Pitt Capital Group LLC in Pittsburgh. \u201cThe future is going to have more connected devices.\u201d  \u2014 With assistance by Tom Giles", "stock": "NVDA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-28", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-28/in-precarious-moment-for-tech-stocks-are-still-finding-friends"}, {"article": "Megacap tech shares slumped again Wednesday as pessimism about the sector showed few signs of letting up.

Store shelves have been wiped clean of the company\u2019s GPUs as would-be miners of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies seek out the chips that were once only popular among PC gamers, but are extremely effective at running the algorithms behind the digital coins.  Shares of Nvidia exploded throughout 2017, gaining 112% in the past year.

Since January 1, bitcoin has fallen 35% while the total market for cryptocurrencies has lost 30% of its value, or roughly $182 billion.  \"With crypto likely contributing larger-than-expected revenue, it is unclear if Q1 will be flattish next quarter,\u201d RBC Capital Markets analyst Mitch Steves said in a note to clients following Nvidia\u2019s record fourth quarter earnings release.  \"We think it is still doable without material crypto exposure given that GPUs are difficult to purchase due to pent-up gaming demand.\"  Despite the fears, Steves maintains an outperform rating for shares of Nvidia, with a target price of $280 \u2014 22% above where the stock was trading early Tuesday.

Cryptocurrency miners contributed about $70 million in sales during the third quarter, and Steves estimates the miners added about $180 million in sales during the fourth quarter.  AMD, Nvidia's main rival in the space, said about one-third of its graphics division growth came from cryptocurrency miners, which led some investors to worry if the company would be growing without the wildly volatile cryptocurrency market. After it's earnings report, it looks like Nvidia isn't facing the same problems.  The one blip in Nvidia's stellar report came from the sluggish growth in its automotive division. Nvidia's chips for power infotainment systems and self-driving cars are off to a slow start, but the company could just be a bit too far ahead of the curve, Steves said. In a couple years, when autonomous cars become more popular and more advanced, the 3% growth will start to be a bigger problem.  Steves rates Nvidia as an \"outperform\" and has a $280 price target, about 22% higher than the current price.

He\u2019s speaking of the keynote address he intends to give at the company\u2019s upcoming GTC conference. Held in San Jose, miles away from the company\u2019s new imposing headquarters, Nvidia is set to host thousands of attendees from the world\u2019s top artificial intelligence, automotive and gaming companies. To Huang, his address needs to inspire and entertain. That should be easy. He\u2019s naturally inspiring and entertaining.  Huang has risen to the elite among Silicon Valley\u2019s visionary leaders. Scores of reports show Nvidia employees love working for him and his addresses are often technical yet accessible. He commands an audience through his passion for the technology his company is creating.  He\u2019s been at the helm of Nvidia since co-founding the company at age 30 in 1993 and has led Nvidia from the maker of computer graphics cards to become the premier platform for artificial intelligence and machine learning. This positions Nvidia at the forefront as the computing industry contemplates a fundamental shift in processing.  Nvidia saw it coming.  In 2008 and 2009 researchers started using GPUs made by Nvidia and AMD to handle work typically performed by microprocessors. The parallel computing processors built into graphics cards made by these two companies offered distinct advantages over the X86 platform championed by Intel. At the time Nvidia was pushing hard into mobile and computing graphics, but several years earlier the company started heavily investing in designing graphics chips to handle non-graphical functions. The industry noticed, and Nvidia made a play for supercomputers.  Now, nearly ten years later, Nvidia\u2019s products are among the fastest and most efficient supercomputing platforms available. Nvidia is set to, literally, power the computing world.  \u201cWe\u2019ve been pioneering this computing approach called GPU computing for over the last decade,\u201d Jensen said. \u201cOver the last seven or eight years, it really went into turbo charge because the model is perfect for artificial intelligence.\u201d  He explained that Nvidia watched the GTC conference explode in popularity with over 22,000 attendees last year. Because of this, at this year\u2019s show, he says, every major artificial intelligence and car company will be there along with every major university. In short, this show has become the largest gathering of machine learning researchers and technologists.  The show, like most company-sponsored events, is primarily to demonstrate the capabilities of Nvidia\u2019s platforms, most of which are aimed at machine learning. With this comes developments in self-driving cars, robotics and, of course, computer graphics. Jensen stressed, in the end, Nvidia is a computer tools company, and he hopes to inspire developers with new tools and by tapping into discoveries made by other researchers.  Nvidia is soaring right now, and there\u2019s a lot to celebrate. Its stock is hovering around its all-time high of $242 up from the mid-teens in 2009, the year of the first GTC conference. The company\u2019s value of $141 billion surpassed IBM\u2019s and is sneaking up on Oracle and Cisco. Even with increasing competition, Nvidia is managing to hold onto its considerable GPU, but supply issues continue to challenge Nvidia.  Operators of distributed ledgers and cryptocurrency mining efforts favor the parallel processing found in GPUs and Nvidia\u2019s products are among the most popular in this market. This popularity has created a significant shortage of graphics cards resulting in developers and gamers often being unable to purchase the latest product from Nvidia. I asked Huang about this supply problem.  \u201cWe\u2019re sold out of many of our high-end SKUs, and so it\u2019s a real challenge keeping [graphic cards] in the marketplace for games,\u201d he said, adding \u201cAt the highest level the way to think about that is because of the philosophy of cryptocurrency \u2014 which is really about taking advantage of distributed high-performance computing \u2014 there are supercomputers in the hands of almost everybody in the world so that no singular force or entity that can control the currency.\u201d  It\u2019s about distributed control, he said, and touted the notion that Nvidia GPUs are the world\u2019s largest installed base of distributed computers, though he still attributes crypto\u2019s demands as a small percentage of Nvidia\u2019s overall business.  \u201cThis still doesn\u2019t change the fact that I\u2019m frustrated so many developers and gamers around the world cannot get access to their GeForces,\u201d Huang said.  So what is he going to do about it? \u201cWe have to build a whole lot more,\u201d he said. \u201cThe video supply chain is working really hard, and you know all of our partners are working around the clock. We\u2019ve got to come closer to the demand of the market. And right now, we\u2019re not anywhere near close to that and so we\u2019re just going to have to keep running.\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019s a good problem to have,\u201d Huang said in a more upbeat tone. \u201cI still wish that we can put more GPUs in the hands of gamers that want to play PUBG.\u201d  And Huang has every reason to be upbeat. His company is racing towards a conclusion that could result in the most significant paradigm shift in computing in decades. Parallel processing units will likely power advanced artificial intelligence which is key to self-driving cars and significant research products in healthcare, climate, and next-generation transportation.  Challenges abound, and the future isn\u2019t guaranteed for Nvidia. The company has to keep pushing deeper into critical markets, get ahead of supply issues and keep courting developers and researchers onto its platforms \u2014 but those are issues for another day. On the eve of GTC 2019 Jensen Huang seems to have a more immediate goal: deliver a rousing keynote address.

That hasn't been the case in recent years, however, as games focus less on pumping in more polygons and instead make small-but-meaningful upgrades with things like texture quality, resolution, lighting, and visual effects work.  Ray tracing looks to be another one of those seemingly modest, but potentially significant upgrades that will hit the gaming landscape in the near future.  What is ray tracing you might ask? It's a much more advanced and lifelike way of rendering light and shadows in a scene. It's what movies and TV shows use to create and blend in amazing CG work with real-life scenes. The drawback is ray tracing often requires extensive server farms to pre-render graphics. That's been too much to ask from a real-time, interactive video game running on a compact box in your home.  Well, at least until now. At the Game Developers Conference, Nvidia, Microsoft, and AMD announced initiatives that will finally make ray tracing possible in real-time games, which means dazzling effects and much more immersive game worlds. Here's a look at what to expect, who's involved in this new push, and what they're bringing to the table.  What is ray tracing?  Ray tracing is a rendering technique that can produce incredibly realistic lighting effects. Essentially, an algorithm can trace the path of light, and then simulate the way that the light interacts with the virtual objects it ultimately hits in the computer-generated world.  We've seen in-game lighting effects become more and more realistic over the years, but the benefits of ray tracing are less about the light itself and more about how it interacts with the world.  Ray tracing allows for dramatically more lifelike shadows and reflections, along with much-improved translucence and scattering. The algorithm takes into account where the light hits and calculates the interaction and interplay much like the human eye would process real light, shadows, and reflections, for example. The way light hits objects in the world also affects which colors you see.  With enough computational power available, it's possible to produce incredibly realistic CG images that are nearly indistinguishable from life. But that's the problem: even a well-equipped gaming PC only has so much GPU power to work with, let alone a modern game console.  Ray tracing is used extensively when developing computer graphics imagery for films and TV shows, but that's because studios can harness the power of an entire server farm (or cloud computing) to get the job done. And even then, it can be a long, laborious process. Doing it on the fly has been far too taxing for existing gaming hardware.  Instead, video games use rasterization, which is a much speedier way to render computer graphics. It converts the 3D graphics into 2D pixels to display on your screen, but rasterization then requires shaders to depict reasonably lifelike lighting effects.  The results just don't look quite as natural or realistic as they would with ray tracing. The benefits of this technology probably won't seem individually mind-blowing, but the collective enhancements could really elevate the realism of interactive game worlds.  Who is working on ray tracing?  Microsoft is the biggest fish in this new video game ray tracing pond, as the company announced DirectX Raytracing (DXR) in the DirectX 12 API. They've created the structure for introducing and computing rays in the world, and have made it possible for developers to begin experimenting with the technology to see what's possible in their game engines.  And they're not alone: Microsoft has been working with several of the world's biggest game makers and game engine creators to help introduce ray tracing into PC games. Electronic Arts' Frostbite and SEED engines will be compatible, along with the ubiquitous Unreal Engine and Unity engine seen throughout the industry.  Creators can get started right away, too, thanks to an experimental DXR SDK available now. Microsoft will share further insight at GDC 2018 this week.  Bringing ray tracing to life in games requires incredible GPU power, so unsurprisingly, Nvidia is also leading the charge. The company's RTX technology leverages a decade of work on graphics algorithms and GPUs, and they're working closely with Microsoft's DXR API to get developers up to speed quickly.  According to Nvidia, \"film-quality algorithms\" and updates to their GameWorks API will deliver lighting, reflections, shadows, and related effects with a previously-unseen level of fidelity. And Nvidia's incoming Volta-class GPUs will be compatible, of course.  And AMD won't be left behind, either. They haven't shared as much as Nvidia yet as of this writing, but they have announced \"real-time ray tracing\" capabilities via their ProRender rendering engine and Radeon GPU Profiler 1.2. However, AMD's announcement seems less focused on games at this point, and more about improving developers' workflows and results with a blend of ray tracing and rasterization.  When will we see the benefits?  While AMD's approach doesn't seem targeted towards games just yet, that same sort of mixed approach is probably what we'll see in the gaming world to start. As Microsoft's official blog post suggested, DirectX Raytracing will \"supplement current rendering techniques.\"  In other words, it'll make some improvements over rasterization, but not fully replace it. Even tomorrow's GPUs probably aren't fully up to that task. But ray tracing will be another tool in game developers' toolkits, and one that will become more and more important over time.  Microsoft suggests that ray tracing will gain more focus \"over the next several years\" for things that rasterization just doesn't excel in, including global illumination. \"Eventually, ray tracing may completely replace rasterization as the standard algorithm for rendering 3D scenes,\" the post concludes.  That's a far-off possibility, but these are important steps in the right direction. Nvidia's new tech demos show that companies like Remedy Entertainment (Quantum Break) and Epic Games (Fortnite) are already learning the ins and outs of ray tracing and delivering dazzling results.  It seems possible that we'll see ray tracing start to roll out in games running on high-end GPUs (like Nvidia's Volta series) in the near future, perhaps later in 2018. Nothing is concrete yet, however.  For now, though, it's exciting to think that this long-awaited ability is finally on the horizon \u2013 and it will only help bridge the gap in graphical fidelity between interactive worlds and the kind of incredible CGI work seen on the big screen.

It's a rendering technique based on how we see the world. In nature, light photons bounce off of various objects before they hit your eyes. Because simulating every photon in real-time is a little ambitious, ray tracing reverses that process, sending millions of lines outwards from the camera towards the scene in front. When a ray hits something, it then checks the object's properties as well as the light sources around it to calculate the exact color that pixel on your screen should be.  There's more to it, of course, but no one wants to read about algorithms on a Monday morning. All you need to know is that it makes scenes look much more realistic. Pretty much all pre-rendered CGI (think, any Hollywood blockbuster) utilizes ray tracing, but it's been thought of as too demanding for use in gaming outside of certain effects.  NVIDIA says lots of developers are on board and will be showing off real-time ray tracing at the GDC this week. Engine partners include Epic Games (Unreal Engine), EA (Frostbite) and Unity; in addition, EA, 4A Games (Metro series) and Remedy (Quantum Break) are signed up on the development side. As previously mentioned, Microsoft is also an API partner with DirectX. What we probably won't see on show are the new GameWorks features, which \"will support Volta and future generation GPU architectures\" and enable ray-traced area shadows, ray-traced glossy reflections and ray-traced ambient occlusion.  GameWorks, for those of you that aren't into PCs and/or controversy, is NVIDIA middleware that allows developers to add extra bells and whistles to their games. A lot of it is related to physics and lighting, but the features you've probably heard of are HairWorks and TurfWorks, which, in games like Final Fantasy XV, allow for richer grass and fluffier creatures. GameWorks is also fairly controversial in PC gaming -- the features are heavily optimized for NVIDIA cards, and running them on an AMD GPU often leads to terrible performance, as NVIDIA won't share its source code with its rival. (Some would argue they lead to terrible performance on NVIDIA cards as well, it's just not quite as pronounced.)  RTX and the as-yet-unnamed GameWorks features were announced on a briefing call last week. The short Q-and-A session that followed can essentially be summarised as \"journalists find creative ways to ask if NVIDIA is going to announce a Volta GeForce card.\" Despite some inventive phrasing, none of the question-askers were successful.  Recent rumors suggested that the next GeForce line won't even be based on Volta, but rather some sort of bridging architecture called \"Ampere.\" That seems unlikely, given the announcement of Volta-specific features, but the \"future generation GPU architectures\" mention does mean NVIDIA could announce wider compatibility if and when Ampere is announced. Now that NVIDIA's GDC is done, the next date for a graphics card announcement would be its GPU Technology Conference (GTC) at the end of the month. GTC is more focused on self-driving cars and AI, but the March 27th keynote could make a nice platform for an announcement.", "stock": "NVDA", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-19", "source": "engadget", "url": "https://www.engadget.com/2018/03/19/nvidia-rtx-ray-casting-gameworks-volta-api/"}, {"article": "On stage at the company's GPU Technology Conference (GTC) today, CEO Jensen Huang described self-driving as \"probably the hardest computing technology we've ever encountered.\" But, after the Uber accident, he says he was reminded just how important this work is. \"We have to solve it step by step by step,\" Huang said. \"We're dedicating ourselves to this problem. The grandest of computer problems.\"  On one end of the Constellation system is a server running NVIDIA's Drive Sim software. As you'd probably guess, it simulates all of the technology you'd find on a self-driving car, including sensors, cameras, radar and lidar (the light and distance measuring component). It's powered by the company's GPUs, each of which creates its own stream of sensor data. The simulation server can also render \"photoreal data streams\" to reflect all sorts of driving conditions, like a fierce blizzard or glare during a sunset.  Another server is powered by the company's Drive Pegasus software, which runs all of NVIDIA's autonomous car technology and processes the incoming sensor data. The Pegasus server sends its responses back to the simulation machine for validation. That feedback loop occurs 30 times a second, according to NVIDIA.  Using this dual server setup, car makers will be able to construct all sorts of extreme scenarios to see how their self-driving algorithms react. The obvious drawback is that it's tough to simulate every potential issue, but it's still better than relying entirely on real-world testing (especially since it can easily be run millions of times per day).  Like any machine learning algorithm, NVIDIA's self-driving technology will only get better with every simulation.

As before, it's backlit with Gigabyte's Fusion tech, which lights up each key individually with up to 16 million colors -- the laptop's only bit of gaming flash.  Like on many other Windows 10 laptops, the touchpad on Gigabyte's flagship is just okay. The level of friction is good, click pressure isn't too heavy and tapping works well. However, it occasionally mis-detected my palm, and doesn't support three- or four-finger Windows 10 gestures used for summoning Cortana and other functions. Gamers and serious graphics users will want a mouse, but the touchpad will at least do in a pinch.  Speaking of peripherals, the Aero 15X has a generous array of high-speed ports for power users. You get one Thunderbolt, three USB 3.1 ports, SD card slot, HDMI 2.0, mini-DP and even an RJ-45 ethernet port. You can squeeze in a generous amount of storage too, thanks to a pair of M.2 PCI-E slots.  The system also features a pair of 2-watt speakers with Dolby ATMOS for gaming. The quality of the sound, alas, isn't quite worthy of the name, as the Aero 15X, like many laptops, lacks anything approximating bass. The rest of the frequencies, at least, are crystal clear, and the stereo separation is better than average.  The standout design feature is the near bezel-less 15.6-inch display. On top of looking good, it keeps the Aero 15X's size about the same as many 14-inch laptops. It also helps explain how Gigabyte was able to fit so much power and battery life into such a small chassis. The downside to these small bezels is that the 720p webcam is mounted on the hinge, creating a very unflattering angle for Skype calls.  My review model had a 1080p display, but a 4K (3,840 x 2,160) screen is also available. That option gives you 100 percent Adobe RGB coverage but will no doubt drain the battery a lot quicker.  In any case, the 1080p IPS display is fantastic. It now has an excellent maximum 144Hz refresh rate, which is a big step up from the 60Hz screen that disappointed gamers on the last model, although it's still lacking NVIDIA G-Sync support, unfortunately. For graphics users, it packs X-Rite Pantone tech, meaning colors are factory calibrated out of the box.  Performance and Battery Life  Gigabyte's last Aero 15X was already near the top of the performance charts thanks to the Intel quad-core i7-7700HQ processor and NVIDIA GTX 1070 Max-Q graphics. The latest model takes it to another level, though, via Intel's freshly-announced 6-core i7-8750H CPU. Gigabyte has promised up to 50 percent more processing grunt, and my tests bear that out, showing a CPUMark score of 12,500, compared to around 8,900 on the older model.  As a reminder, Max-Q cards are a bit slower than the non-Max-Q versions, but more battery-friendly. So, you'd expect the new Aero to pack more power than an NVIDIA GTX 1060 laptop, but less than one with a GTX 1070. Sure enough, it falls just short of the Alienware 15 in the 3D Mark 11 test suite, and sits another notch below the aforementioned ASUS ROG Zephyrus. However, it smokes models like the Alienware 13 and latest Surface Book, both of which pack the GTX 1060 chip. Performance is closer to the GTX 1070 than the 1060.  To see how the Aero 15X handled games, I tested Witcher 3, Wolfenstein II and Rise of the Tomb Raider. At 1080p, it handled all of those games incredibly smoothly, hitting 120 fps on Rise of the Tomb Raider -- just a smidge below the GTX 1070-equipped Alienware 15. Even on a 4K monitor, the frame rate on Witcher 3 was well over 30 fps, more than acceptable for a laptop so small.  I also edited a couple of videos with the Aero 15X, mixing HD and 4K video, and it really shone. It was snappy and responsive with resource-hungry video, and could render stabilization and other demanding tasks rapidly. Final high-quality, full HD encoding was equally quick.

However, when gaming, video editing or running an external 4K monitor, the fans crank up and get pretty noisy. During normal use they rarely come on, though, and when they do, the sound is not obnoxious. Most importantly, parts get warm but never hot to the touch. In Gigabyte's Smart Manager, you can even tweak the fans for quiet, normal and gaming operation.  The Aero 15X's superpower is its battery life. It lasted a stellar 7:40 in our battery rundown test, nearly long enough to let me continuously watch movies on a Paris/Vancouver flight. That's about twice as long as the latest GS63VR 7RG Stealth Pro and, miles ahead of the ROG Zephyrus. How did Gigabyte pull this off?  For one thing, the Aero 15X packs a massive 94.24 Wh battery, almost double the 50 Wh unit in the ASUS ROG Zephyrus. It also offloads video playback chores to the integrated Intel UHD 630 graphics, keeping the more power-hungry GTX 1070 idle. You can expect a lot less battery life while gaming, of course, but considerably more than rivals. Again, as with other laptops, I'd expect considerably less battery life with the 4K display option.  Pricing and the Competition  The Aero 15X starts at $2,200 with a 1080p 144Hz display and Windows 10. Stepping up to the 4K screen and Windows Pro will cost you $200 more. It's also launching the slightly de-tuned Aero 15 with the same Intel i7-8750H 6-core processor and still-excellent NVIDIA GTX 1060 graphics, starting at $2,000.  You can get up to 32GB for the Aero 15/15X, and I'd recommend you do just that if you plan on doing graphics work or heavy gaming. Frankly, 16GB just isn't enough anymore for power users, thanks to memory bloat in many apps, especially browsers like Firefox and Chrome. I found that Premiere Pro 2018 CC, another memory hog, used nearly 10GB of RAM at times.  At $2,200, the Aero 15X will be competitive with the aforementioned MSI GS63VR 7RG Stealth Pro ($2,400) and $2,300 ASUS ROG Zephyrus equipped with full NVIDIA GTX 1070 graphics. If you're willing to step down to NVIDIA GTX 1060 graphics, however, the Razer Blade is now considerably cheaper at $1,700.  Wrap-up  With Gigabyte's refresh of the Aero 15X, it now has few faults, blending class-leading performance, portability and incredible battery life. It also has a wide range of ports, an excellent keyboard, and finally, a fast-refreshing 144Hz screen better suited for gaming. However, a better touchpad would have been nice, and the minimalistic design won't thrill those who want their gaming laptops to look the part.  As someone who also does a lot video editing, compositing and 3D animation, graphics performance, weight and battery life are all paramount for me. I recently covered the Geneva Motor Show, and needed something reasonably light with enough power to edit 4K video and sufficient battery life to go most of the day. That's another use case where the Aero 15X really shines, providing all three of those things at once. For people like me, the excellent gaming performance is just a bonus.  All that said, with the launch of Intel's new high-performance laptop CPU's, a wave of lightweight, powerful laptops arrived this week from ASUS, MSI, Samsung and others. The new ASUS ROG Zephyrus M laptop, for instance, has nearly identical specs to the Gigabyte Aero 15X, with the same eighth-gen Core i7 CPU, GTX 1070 Max-Q graphics and 144Hz screen. The same goes for MSI's GS65 \"Stealth Thin\" laptop, so Gigabyte has a lot of high-powered competition incoming.", "stock": "NVDA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-04-04", "source": "engadget", "url": "https://www.engadget.com/2018/04/04/gigabyte-aero-15x-review/"}, {"article": "Here are some of the companies with shares expected to trade actively in Tuesday\u2019s session.

The SEC insisted on the name changes amid a speculative frenzy for anything associated with bitcoin or blockchain, the technology behind the cryptocurrency.  \u201cYou can understand the SEC\u2019s point of view,\u201d said Eric Ervin, chief executive officer of Reality Shares, one of the firms that had to change the name of its ETF. \u201cThere are a lot of retail mom-and-pop investors buying anything blockchain without really understanding what\u2019s in it.\u201d  As a result of the SEC\u2019s prohibition, the Reality Shares Nasdaq Blockchain Economy ETF will be called the Reality Shares NexGen Economy ETF and the Amplify Blockchain Leaders ETF will instead be named the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF.

To be the first to know, please click here.  Alibaba reported its earnings for its fiscal Q3 2018 (ended December 31, 2017), which showed that its revenue grew 56% year-over-year (YoY) to $12.8 billion, its highest ever. Its core commerce continues to be the bulk of its business, bringing in $11.3 billion in the quarter, which is up 57% YoY.  The huge revenue numbers are partially due to Alibaba's performance during Singles' Day, which set records itself.  Alibaba saw the gross merchandise value (GMV) that was handled through Alipay on its marketplaces reach $25.9 billion on Singles' Day, up 39% YoY. It credits much of the sales holiday's success to its logistics and payments capabilities, which helped process as many as 325,000 orders per second. This suggests that Alibaba's move to work with and upgrade approximately 600,000 smaller physical retailers for Singles' Day paid off. These locations served as delivery and storage locations for Alibaba, and were outfitted with technologies like facial-recognition payments, helping Alibaba handle the incredible level of consumer demand, and displaying the value that brick-and-mortar locations can have for Alibaba.  Alibaba's \"New Retail\" initiatives are showing promising results, and it's preparing to expand them across China. Alibaba's category that includes New Retail initiatives\u2014 its efforts to imbue brick-and-mortar retail with technology and intertwine it with e-commerce \u2014 is still small, bringing in $129 million this quarter, but it's growing at a clip of 525% YoY. The company is working to further this promising growth by continuing to invest in physical retail, adding five new locations for its high-tech Hema grocery stores, bringing the number of locations to 25. Additionally, it recently made a $2.9 billion investment in hypermarket operator Sun Art Retail Group for a 36% stake in the company. Alibaba says its investment in Sun Art is part of its preparations to expand its New Retail initiatives on a national scale, which could be a boon for the company.  The e-commerce competition between Alibaba and JD.com is set to spill into brick-and-mortar. While Alibaba is working with convenience stores and looking to bring its retail innovations across China, JD.com is preparing to open hundreds of unmanned stores, and Tencent, its largest stakeholder, is making investments akin to Alibaba's in Sun Art. Both competitors are looking to bolster their performances online and in-store with these expansions, and they're likely to butt heads for the foreseeable future across channels.

The talks were reportedly not CEO level, and they're not guaranteed to lead to any type of cooperation, but a potential partnership could hold a lot of value for both parties.  For Kroger, a partnership with Alibaba may help it revolutionize its e-commerce and in-store experiences. Alibaba has a number of technologies that would benefit Kroger if the partnership comes to fruition. And Kroger may have an interest in such innovations, as it recently embarked on its Restock Kroger initiative to improve its digital and omnichannel capabilities.  Alibaba has expertise in e-commerce, which means that it can both advise Kroger as it looks to revamp its digital offerings, and provide some of its algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI) to help Kroger better personalize its online shopping experience.  Brick-and-mortar has been a focus for Alibaba recently, and it's developed some in-store innovations that would be valuable to Kroger. Technology including in-store AI for recommendations, in-store data analytics, automated grocery delivery help, and more could all help Kroger's in-store operations and improve its performance.  Working with Kroger could give Alibaba the ability to sell more American goods or gain data on the US market. If the potential partnership results in Kroger selling products through Alibaba's marketplace in China, Alibaba would be offering more US goods to Chinese consumers, who are very interested in them, likely bringing in new sales. But if a deal sees Alibaba working with Kroger in the US-based retailer's stores, Alibaba would be able to collect data on US consumers, a market it's shown an interest in.  Regardless of whether they ink a deal, this meeting displays Alibaba's interest in expanding its relationship with US retailers and potentially entering the market.Previously, Alibaba has been building its relationships with US merchants, and even hosted a conference in Detroit to launch an initiative to help them sell to Chinese consumers. Meeting with Kroger may mean that Alibaba is looking to bring more retailers to its marketplace to get more cross-border sales, or it could be building up its partners to make an entrance into the US market. Working with Kroger would be a significant step in both directions.  Jonathan Camhi, research analyst for BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has laid out the case for why retailers must transition to an omnichannel fulfillment model, and the challenges complicating that transition for most companies. This omnichannel fulfillment report also detail the benefits and difficulties involved with specific omnichannel fulfillment services like click-and-collect, ship-to-store, and ship-from-store, providing examples of retailers that have experienced success and struggles with these methods. Lastly, it walks through the steps retailers need to take to optimize omnichannel fulfillment for lower costs and faster delivery times.  Here are some of the key takeaways from the report:  Brick-and-mortar retailers must cut delivery times and costs to meet online shoppers' expectations of free and fast shipping.  Omnichannel fulfillment services can help retailers achieve that goal while also keeping their stores relevant.  However, few retailers have mastered these services, which has led to increasing shipping costs eating into their profit margins.  In order to optimize costs and realize the full benefits of these omnichannel services, retailers must undertake costly and time-consuming transformations of their logistics, inventory, and store systems and operations.  In full, the report:  Details the benefits of omnichannel services like click-and-collect and ship-from-store, including lowering delivery times and costs, and driving in-store traffic and sales.  Provides examples of the successes and struggles various retailers have experienced with omnichannel delivery.  Explains why retailers are having trouble managing costs with their omnichannel fulfillment efforts, which are eating into their profits.  Lays out what steps retailers need to take to optimize costs for their omnichannel operations by placing inventory where it best meets customer demand.  Interested in getting the full report?

JD.com reported its Q4 2017 results, with net revenue growing 38.7% year-over-year (YoY) to 110 billion yuan ($16.9 billion) for the quarter, while GMV grew to 403.4 billion yuan ($63.6 billion), a 33% YoY increase.  The revenue growth, while impressive, marked a deceleration from 39% YoY revenue growth in Q3 2017. Growth in revenue also failed to outpace mounting expenses in fulfillment, marketing, and most notably, in retail investments designed to head off Alibaba \u2014 the company posted a net loss for Q4 of 909 million yuan ($140 million).  The company's domestic and international growth efforts came at a heavy price:  Alibaba, Tencent, and JD.com spent billions to carve up China. In an effort to counter rival Alibaba as it forces physical retailers to give up partnerships with its competitors, JD.com and Tencent, JD.com's largest shareholder, embarked on a spending spree throughout 2017. Through investments ranging from hundreds of millions of dollars to billions, the pair secured exclusive partnerships with shopping malls, convenience stores, cinemas, hotels, and other commercial businesses across China.

Fulfillment costs rose to 8 billion yuan ($1.2 billion) in Q4, a 45.7% YoY increase. JD.com ended the year operating 486 warehouses, a 90% YoY increase from 256 warehouses in 2016. To maintain momentum in 2018, JD Logistics, JD.com's logistics arm, which was made into its own business in April 2017, raised $2.5 billion from multiple investors in a funding round announced two weeks ago.

Marketing costs to compete on Singles' Day are rising.JD.com's marketing expenses grew to 4.7 billion yuan ($0.7 billion) in the fourth quarter, up 35% YoY. A major factor behind those rising costs was marketing for Singles' Day 2017, which paid off in the form of $19.1 billion in transaction volume for JD.com, more than 50% higher than a year earlier. The leading beneficiary of Singles' Day is Alibaba, which generated $25.3 billion in revenue on that day.  International growth plans are key to JD.com's success in 2018. Outside of China, JD.com's war against Alibaba is fiercest in Southeast Asia. The region is critical because it will see its internet economy grow to $200 billion by 2025, according to Google estimates cited by TechCrunch. In 2017, JD.com's investments in Southeast Asia expanded beyond its beachhead in Indonesia, for example, through large investments in e-commerce companies in Thailand and Vietnam. A key factor behind JD.com's overall success in 2018 will be whether the firm can grow its volume in Southeast Asia against mounting competitive pressure form Alibaba and others.", "stock": "BABA", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-05", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/jdcoms-efforts-fend-off-alibaba-losses-q4-2018-3"}, {"article": "Jack Ma Ruben Sprich/Reuters  Alibaba founder Jack Ma called on Facebook to fix its privacy issues in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal.

Participants included Alibaba Innovation Ventures (the venture capital investment arm of Alibaba Group), Nationwide Insurance and returning investors Aleph, Mosaic Ventures, Slow Ventures, True Ventures and Tusk Ventures.  Nexar\u2019s dashcam app relies on computer vision and sensor fusion to detect accidents and analyze road conditions, then sends real-time alerts to other vehicles on its network. Its tech is also used by insurance companies for collision reconstructions to help with claim investigations.  The Tel Aviv-based company also made two big leadership announcements. Yoad Shraybom, the former chief financial officer of the Walt Disney Company in Turkey, Israel and Greece, is now its CFO, and Incapsula founder and former general manager Marc Gaffan will serve as its chief business officer. Though Nexar\u2019s newly-minted CFO and CBO positions might prompt speculation that it is eyeing a stock offering (Mobileye, another road safety tech company, went public in 2014), co-founder and CEO Eran Shir said there are no current plans for an IPO. Instead, the addition of Shraybom and Gaffan is meant to help the company\u2019s global expansion. Ibex partner Elan Zivotofsky also joined its board.  Nexar has now raised $45 million in total funding and is using its new capital to build its vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) network by signing partnerships with insurance companies, drivers on ride-sharing services like Uber or Lyft, automakers and municipalities that use its tech to monitor traffic and street infrastructure. For cities, Nexar\u2019s tools helps them find ways to fix traffic bottlenecks or spot potholes, cracks and other potentially dangerous road damage by creating a \u201cdigital MRI of the city,\u201d said Shir in an email.  Nexar\u2019s app launched in 2016 and is now used by drivers in 740 cities across 160 countries, the company claims. Its biggest markets are currently New York City (Nexar says its used by more than 10% of ride-sharing drivers there), San Francisco, Tel Aviv and Las Vegas. The addition of Alibaba as an investor may help Nexar add some Chinese cities to that list, too.  \u201cChina is an incredibly exciting market for us which we always have our eye on. We do already have a large number of drivers in China who drive with Nexar, and partnering with local players in the region could assist in accelerating our drivers\u2019 footprint in the region,\u201d said Shir.  Nexar\u2019s competitors include Mobileye, which was acquired by Intel for $15.3 billion last year, and Nauto, which also use AI-based dashcams to send information through V2V networks. Shir says Nexar differentiates by allowing its drivers to download a mobile app that turns their smartphones into a dashcam so they don\u2019t need to buy separate hardware.

The Chinese firm, the dominant e-commerce player in its country, gobbled up a 15 percent stake in Beijing Easyhome Furnishing for RMB 5.45 billion, or around $867 million, and pumped $486 million into a big data retail firm in two deals announced over the weekend.  Beijing Easyhome operates 223 physical home furnishing and DIY-style stores across 29 provinces in China, which it claims makes it the country\u2019s second largest in its field.  The second outlay is for a 38 percent stake in Shiji Retail Information Technology, Reuters reports, which works with hotels and high-street retailers on data-related services to increase customer footfall, grow engagement and more.  The Beijing Easyhome deal is the fourth major investment that the e-commerce giant has made in a brick and mortar chain. Last year, it bought major holdings in hypermarket firm Sun Art ($2.9 billion) and shopping mall operator InTime ($2.6 billion). Prior to that, it invested in high-profile electronics retailer Suning ($4.6 billion) having bought an initial stake in InTime back in 2014.  The company has also made its own move independently through its Hema supermarket chain, which was one of the early adopters of cashier-less checkouts.

In a notable side-note to that battle, China now has the world\u2019s highest-valued AI startup after SenseTime, a company founded in 2014, announced a $600 million Series C investment round. A source with knowledge of discussions told TechCrunch that the round values the company at over $4.5 billion, while it is also raising an extension to this round. That marks a hefty increase on the company\u2019s most recent $1.5 billion valuation when it raised a $410 million Series B last year.  SenseTime CEO Li Xu said the company plans to use the capital to expand its presence overseas and \u201cwiden the scope for more industrial application of AI.\u201d  Beyond the high figures involved \u2014 the round is a record fundraising for an AI company worldwide \u2014 SenseTime\u2019s investment efforts are notable because of the names that have backed it.  Principally that\u2019s Alibaba, the $429 billion e-commerce giant, which led this Series C round and is reportedly now SenseTime\u2019s largest single investor, according to Bloomberg.  Beyond that, U.S. chipmaker giant Qualcomm signed up last year \u2014 seemingly as an early participant in this round \u2014 while Singapore\u2019s sovereign fund Temasek and China\u2019s largest electronics retailer Suning, which has taken investment from Alibaba, entered the round as new backers. Indeed, Suning\u2019s push to for its store of the future, which was started by that Alibaba investment, uses SenseTime to power its facial recognition payment at staff-less checkouts and also for customer analysis using big data systems.  \u201cSenseTime is doing pioneering work in artificial intelligence. We are especially impressed by their R&D capabilities in deep learning and visual computing. Our business at Alibaba is already seeing tangible benefits from our investments in AI and we are committed to further investment,\u201d said Joe Tsai, Alibaba\u2019s executive vice chairman.  SenseTime said it has more than 400 customers across a range of verticals including fintech, automotive, fintech, smartphones, smart city development and more that include Honda, Nvidia, China\u2019s UnionPay, Weibo, China Merchants Bank, Huawei, Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi.  Perhaps its most visible partner is the Chinese government, which uses its systems for its national surveillance system. SenseTime process data captured by China\u2019s 170 million CCTV cameras and newer systems which include smart glasses worn by police offers on the street.  China has placed vast emphasis on tech development, with AI one of its key flagposts.

Even two years ago, the potential was evident, with Lee explaining that teaching, medicine and healthcare were obvious areas for disruption.  Perhaps the main difference between the state of AI development in the U.S. and China is that, in America, much of the technology is being developed in big tech firms like Amazon and Google.

Following up on the buzz at MWC 2018 will be tough for manufacturer HMD Global, but it will give it a try with a 4G-enabled version of the phone called the Nokia 3310 4G.  Unlike the top-secret Samsung Galaxy S9, the 3310 4G has actually already been announced in China, but isn\u2019t confirmed for arrival elsewhere \u2013 these are the sort of details we look forward to being revealed at MWC.  Even so, the device is in the open and as such, we know a lot about it. The 4G-friendly 3310 will look the same as last year\u2019s model, but the software inside is reportedly improved over a Java-based platform to an Android-based operating system made by Chinese retail giant Alibaba \u2013 though that could change if it makes it to the US, UK or AU regions.  The big 4G differences  Hopping up from 2G and 3G to 4G with the new version of the Nokia 3310 comes with its share of perks, including the ability to act as a Wi-Fi hot spot, and high-definition VoLTE calling support.  Since the phone doesn\u2019t appear to have changed, the same can presumably be said about its battery life. Based on projections, 4G looks to take a heavy toll on the 3310, bringing the lifespan down to about five hours of talk time compared to the 2G version\u2019s 15-hour target.  Global availability of the Nokia 3310 4G is unconfirmed, as is its price, but we expect at least a $20-30 premium for the feature compared to the 3G version, which sits at $59 in the US, \u00a359.99 in the UK and AU$89.95 in Australia.  If it shows up at MWC at the end of February, Nokia\u2019s nostalgia trip of a phone might not capture hearts and minds that it did last year, but a 4G-enhanced classic will certainly appeal to good amount of people.

The coalition is spearheaded by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), TRAFFIC and the International Fund for Animal Welfare. They'll collaborate directly with these tech companies in drawing up action plans to take on trafficking threats and offering staff trainings to pinpoint illegal sales.  Giavanna Grein, program officer for wildlife crime for TRAFFIC at WWF, said this will happen in two phases. First, companies will share what they have learned about addressing specific trade threats so they can learn from one another. Then, each company will develop a plan for its sites or apps.  \"Law enforcement alone cannot police the open web globally due to the sheer scale of online trade and their limited resources,\" Crawford Allan, senior director for wildlife crime at TRAFFIC at WWF, told Engadget. \"We realized if the companies can remove ads before they are posted or can look out for organized criminals that they can report to law enforcement, this will really help tackle the problem rapidly.\"  Allan said this coalition is the first of its kind, especially among companies that would traditionally be seen as competitors. Beyond Google and Alibaba, organizations that have joined the coalition are Baidu, Baixing, eBay, Etsy, Facebook, Huaxia Collection, Instagram, Kuaishou, Mall for Africa, Microsoft, Pinterest, Qyer, Ruby Lane, Shengshi Collection, Tencent, Wen Wan Tian Xia, Zhongyikupai, Zhuanzhuan and 58 Group.  When they asked these companies to be part of the coalition, WWF, TRAFFIC and IFAW laid out the issues around wildlife trade and the role of these sites in facilitating illegal trade and explained how the companies can combat this activity by setting up closed-door workshops among the businesses. You might assume it would be a challenge to corral all these competitors, but Allan said they were all willing to confront the issue as an industry.  Officials stand by a one-horned rhinoceros that was killed and de-horned by poachers in Kaziranga India, 2017.  From the tech perspective, this coalition builds on efforts to fight illegal trafficking online. Mike Carson, eBay's senior manager of global policy and regulatory management, told Engadget the retail site established a global ivory ban back in 2008. It has been working to flag and scrub listings from criminal traders, and said 45,000 illegal wildlife listings were blocked or removed last year alone.  Carson said eBay had been working with WWF, TRAFFIC and IFAW to train employees. He said he is looking forward to working with industry peers to combat the trade, but said there's always room for improvement: eBay will build on these policies through the coalition and \"define a set of areas\" where wildlife trafficking seems to be most prevalent on the site.  A big part of the coalition's work will be to educate consumers about the importance of avoiding goods like ivory that were most likely the result of illegal poaching, Carson said.  Carved pieces of confiscated ivory before being crushed in New York, 2015.  \"There should be a negative stigma attached to the purchase and sale of illegal wildlife products, just as there is for other illegal items like drugs or weapons,\" he added.  Consumer awareness is key, said Susan Lieberman, vice president of international policy at the Wildlife Conservation Society, which isn't part of the coalition.  \"You aren't going to a shopping mall -- you are buying from the comfort of home, rather anonymously. When people are home on their computers there needs to be more awareness raised among the average customer,\" she said. \"The customer needs to know that it is illegal. When companies start these awareness campaigns, it's not about nice brochures but making sure people can't even find these items to begin with. You have to make it harder for [traders].\"  She said shoppers who have doubts about an item's provenance should just not buy it -- something like a rhino horn should be a no-brainer.  Lieberman has spent 30 years monitoring wildlife trade, and said that in the past governments could target brick-and-mortar shops selling illegal goods, but internet has led to something of a free-for-all.  She said she doesn't think tech companies have done enough in the past to put an end to this, but this coalition is a step in the right direction.  \"Social media has just made it easy -- too easy -- for this kind of illegal activity. Good things are easier, too, but we just need to make sure it is extremely hard for people to buy and sell endangered species,\" Lieberman added.  Allan believes once companies start stepping up enforcement on their platforms, criminals will move more of their operations to the \"dark web,\" which will hopefully shrink their audience and stem sales.  It might be impossible to make this criminal activity go extinct, but the coalition is a step in the right direction of saving some of the Earth's most precious species.

Or otherwise underserved and rural communities that may not have access to internet connections, smartphones or even checking accounts? You know, all the things that Amazon's new store demands of shoppers just to get in the door.  As our economy embraces digital transactions while shunning cash, it's the poor that will be most harmed. \"There are many people who are unbanked and cannot receive lines of credit for a whole range of reasons,\" Rainey Reitman, activism director at the Electronic Frontiers Foundation, told Fast Company, \"and a ban on cash would particularly impact the unbanked community.\"  This community is not a small one. According to a 2014 Gallup poll, 29 percent of Americans don't have a credit card. What's more, according to the 2013 U.S. Survey of Consumer Finance, 7.5 percent of American households don't have bank accounts at all -- that's nearly 24 million people. Worldwide, 38 percent of the global population does not have access to a conventional bank account, roughly 2 billion adults. That figure has been shrinking steadily since 2011, per the World Bank, yet more than half of adults in the poorest 40 percent of households in developing countries lack access to a bank account as of 2014. For them, cash is the only way they can participate in the economy.  However, dealing in cash is costly to banks. Storing, processing and transferring stacks of cash is far more expensive for financial institutions than simply wiring digital funds, and those costs are often passed along to the customer.  Prepaid cards are one alternative to dealing in cash and a popular one for the unbanked community. In 2013, the FDIC found that among people without bank accounts, 22 percent had used a general purpose reloadable (GPR) prepaid card within the previous 12 months, compared to just five percent of people with accounts. These cards can be loaded either through direct deposit or cash and utilized like bank-issued debit cards for both online and offline purchases. And because consumers can't spend more money than the card is loaded with, it can serve as a helpful means of budgeting and controlling one's spending without the danger of overdraft fees.  However, GPR cards are not without their drawbacks. They are often saddled with numerous and steep fees for everything from using them to withdraw cash from ATMs to making online purchases -- even putting money on the card can come with a fee. What's more, these fees vary widely between providers, yet according to a 2015 Pew Charitable Trust study, only around a third of consumers actually compare the fees and features of various cards before purchasing them.  Mobile money accounts are another emerging alternative to traditional bank accounts. Mobile money is essentially an electronic wallet that allows users to send and receive funds using their phone. The technology has taken hold in both Sub-Saharan Africa and China, where Alibaba reported in 2014 that more than half of its transactions were made on mobile devices using its Alipay digital wallet. The number of adults in that region with any type of financial account rose from 24 to 34 percent between 2011 and 2014, a 10 percent increase in a region where two-thirds of adults still have no form of financial account at all.  But even as prepaid cards and mobile money accounts move into the mainstream of financial services, they are not a permanent solution to the problems facing the unbanked community. Eventually, government action may prove necessary.  \"Clearly you're going to need a way to get everybody into the system if you're going to get rid of cash,\" Susan Athey, the Economics of Technology Professor at Stanford Graduate School of Business, told Engadget in October. \"One of the things the government will have to do is ensure banking access to everyone.\"    Just as the FDIC offers insurance on both conventional bank accounts and prepaid cards, the government would not be remiss to require financial institutions to offer low-cost services like zero-interest checking accounts to their customers. Doing so would provide a direct means of entry into the world of digital finances for poorer people.  Doing so would also offer a slew of benefits to both consumers and their financial institutions. Previously unbanked customers would not only be able to more fully participate in the economy but also would then have access to safer and speedier financial transactions with less threat of corruption or theft. Meanwhile banks would be able to more accurately track a new set of customers' financial histories, thereby enabling them to create and market a new ecosystem of products such as microloans to these customers, according to the Gates Foundation Financial Services for the Poor program.  Amazon has already taken a number of steps to be as inclusive as it can when it comes to extracting money from its customers. This is the company that pioneered the Dash button (of which there are more than 250 varieties, both physical and digital), after all. For example, Amazon rolled out a new feature dubbed Amazon Pay Places last July, which enables users to pay for items at real-world stores, like TGI Fridays, and pay for them through their existing Amazon account with the mobile app.  What's more, the company already has a mechanism for paying for its wares with cash: It's this wild new thing the kids are calling gift cards, which can be purchased for physical currency at a variety of locations including Western Union, MoneyGram and Coinstar.  Additionally, the company has a separate program called Amazon Cash that enables users to pay their account balances at any of 16 different chains -- like 7-Eleven and GameStop -- by having the cashier swipe a bar code generated by their mobile app and handing over the appropriate amount of money. However, neither of these methods are quite as seamless or as streamlined as what Go shoppers with bank accounts experience, with each demanding a separate trip to a third-party vendor to make the currency exchange. And for the foreseeable future, that will simply be the cost of doing business for those living outside the formal banking system.

BABA -2.21% Executive Chairman Jack Ma is doubling down on Southeast Asia, investing another $2 billion in e-commerce subsidiary Lazada Group and naming trusted confidante Lucy Peng as its chief executive.  The investment announced Monday comes on top of the $2 billion the Chinese e-commerce giant has poured into Lazada since buying a majority stake in 2016.  Singapore-based Lazada operates online marketplaces in six Southeast Asian countries including Indonesia, selling everything from lipstick and car wax to instant coffee and smartphones.  Ms. Peng, a billionaire who helped found Alibaba in 1999, will replace Lazada founder Max Bittner as CEO. Ms. Peng is currently chairwoman of Lazada and will retain that role.  The 44-year-old Ms. Peng helped build Alibaba\u2019s mobile-payment affiliate Ant Financial Services Group\u2014previously known as Alipay\u2014serving as chief executive from 2010 to 2016, and still serves as its chairwoman.  In a 2016 letter to employees, Mr. Ma said Ms. Peng was a \u201crock-steady presence in the face of changing times,\u201d and that \u201cLucy is Alibaba\u2019s soul mate.\u201d  The new investment and the promotion of Ms. Peng show the importance of Southeast Asia to Alibaba, which has been expanding there as growth at home slows.  The region is home to about 600 million people, and is increasingly attracting the interest of global e-commerce companies eager to get a foothold as more people get internet access and shop online, largely via smartphones.  U.S. e-commerce behemoth Amazon.com Inc. launched its Prime Now fast delivery option in Singapore last July. Chinese online retailer JD.com and Tencent Holdings Ltd -backed Sea Holdings Ltd. also operate e-commerce platforms or have joint ventures in the region.  Southeast Asia\u2019s e-commerce market has grown more than 40% annually since 2015 to reach $10.9 billion in revenue last year, according to a December report co-written by Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google and Temasek Holdings. The market is expected to grow to $88.1 billion by 2025, the report forecast.  Alibaba owns about 83% of Lazada. The subsidiary helped Alibaba almost double its international commerce retail revenues to $727 million in the quarter ended Dec. 31, the company said in a statement in February, describing markets in the region as \u201cin the early innings of the game\u201d and pledging to continue investing there.  Still, international commerce retail revenues are a fraction of what Alibaba earns at home, with its Chinese commerce revenues hitting $9.2 billion in the same quarter.

Two other Chinese internet giants, Baidu Inc. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. , have led fundings of at least $2.5 billion into Chinese electric-car companies including NiO and WM Motor Technology. Beyond China, Tencent also invested $1.8 billion for a 5% stake in Tesla Inc. last March.

With a vast network of surveillance cameras, China is using facial recognition to identify criminal suspects as well as to influence behavior, such as discouraging jaywalking.  The technology also has commercial applications, with some companies now using it instead of badges to grant employees access to their workplaces. Mr. Xu said SenseTime would use the new funding to focus on expanding the technology\u2019s commercial applications and AI capabilities.

The country\u2019s securities regulator has reached out to a number of state-owned investment banks to explore ways to let already-listed companies and private businesses issue shares on the mainland, according to investment bankers briefed on the discussions.  \u2018The government has a long-term plan to wean these companies off the U.S.\u2019 \u2014Paul Gillis, Peking University\u2019s Guanghua School of Management  One option being considered is to allow such companies to issue depositary receipts, so they can bypass Chinese law prohibiting firms incorporated overseas from going public on the mainland. The likes of Tencent and Alibaba are incorporated abroad in a special corporate structure so they can get around Chinese restrictions on foreigners investing in sectors like technology.  It is part of China\u2019s longer-term goal to turn the tide on years of the country\u2019s businesses going public overseas. Beijing would like to see more Chinese companies choose the mainland capital market as their primary listing destination eventually, the investment bankers said.  \u201cAt some point, it makes sense for Alibaba and Tencent to have their primary listings in China,\u201d said Paul Gillis, an accounting professor at Peking University\u2019s Guanghua School of Management. \u201cThe government has a long-term plan to wean these companies off the U.S.\u201d  \u201cThis would be a step in that direction,\u201d he said.  Tencent and Alibaba are already among the world\u2019s most valuable companies, and China has earmarked frontier technologies such as artificial intelligence as important growth drivers for the country\u2019s economy.  Shares in Hong Kong-listed Tencent\u2014the owner of China\u2019s most popular messaging app, WeChat\u2014more than doubled last year. In the process Tencent became the first Chinese technology company to crack the $500 billion valuation club, joining industry titans such as Facebook Inc. and Apple Inc.  NYSE-listed shares of Alibaba, China\u2019s largest e-commerce company, almost doubled last year. Alibaba now has a market capitalization of more than $460 billion.  In recent days, a number of tech companies said they are open to a China listing, though executives haven\u2019t gone into details. Tencent Chief Executive Pony Ma said the company would \u201cactively consider\u201d listing inside China. Baidu Inc. Chairman Robin Li said recently that the search-engine company has \u201calways wanted to come home to China.\u201d Richard Liu, chairman of Nasdaq-listed e-commerce company JD.com Inc., said \u201cif the authorities allow it, we are willing.\u201d The executives were speaking on the sidelines of China\u2019s annual legislative meetings, currently taking place in Beijing.  Chinese technology firms have in the past often opted for overseas listings, many in the U.S., for the prestige and to benefit from rules allowing dual-class share structures that give company owners more control over the business. The Chinese regulator\u2019s tough listing rules, such as the requirement for companies to be profitable for three years before listing, have also deterred high-growth technology firms from seeking direct share sales at home.  The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month that Chinese regulators have already approached smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp., which has plans to go public in Hong Kong. Investors say it would be sensible for China\u2019s technology companies to list at home, given the brand awareness they command there and the likelihood their shares would trade at high valuations.  Still, analysts have some concerns. Depending on how contracts are drawn up, Chinese individual investors buying depository receipts could lack full shareholder rights, they say. The listings of a few hot names could also fuel speculation by Chinese individual investors, who dominate trading on the mainland.  \u201cWhen the government is supporting something, everyone rushes in,\u201d said T.J. Wong, a professor of business administration and accounting at the University of Southern California\u2019s Marshall School of Business. \u201cWhat you don\u2019t want is a huge bubble, then a burst.\u201d  Chinese companies often have to wait years before getting approval from the market regulator to list their shares. The authorities would likely expedite this process for some tech firms, the investment bankers said.  Letting a number of top-quality companies issue shares on the mainland could help the Chinese market mature, analysts said. Beijing\u2019s goal, said one foreign banker, is to \u201ctake the winners.\u201d  It isn\u2019t clear when the regulator would formally invite specific companies into its market, given that changes to Chinese securities law would need high-level leadership approval.  \u2014Yoko Kubota contributed to this article.
