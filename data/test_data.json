[{"article": "(Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google (GOOGL.O) corporate brands dropped in an annual survey while Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) maintained the top spot for the third consecutive year, and electric carmaker Telsa Inc (TSLA.O) rocketed higher after sending a red Roadster into space.  A woman looks at the screen of her mobile phone in front of an Apple logo outside its store in Shanghai, China July 30, 2017. REUTERS/Aly Song  IPhone maker Apple dropped to 29th from its previous position of No. 5, and Google dropped from 8th to No. 28. Apple had ranked No. 2 as recently as 2016, according to the annual Harris Poll Reputation Quotient poll released on Tuesday.  The poll, conducted since 1999, surveyed 25,800 U.S. adults from Dec. 11 to Jan. 12 on the reputations the \u201cmost visible\u201d corporate brands.  John Gerzema, CEO of the Harris Poll, told Reuters in an interview that the likely reason Apple and Google fell was that they have not introduced as many attention-grabbing products as they did in past years, such as when Google rolled out free offerings like its Google Docs word processor or Google Maps and Apple\u2019s then-CEO Steve Jobs introduced the iPod, iPhone and iPad.  \u201cGoogle and Apple, at this moment, are sort of in valleys,\u201d Gerzema said. \u201cWe\u2019re not quite to self-driving cars yet. We\u2019re not yet seeing all the things in artificial intelligence they\u2019re going to do.\u201d  Meanwhile, Amazon.com held on to the No. 1 spot, which it has held for five years with the exception of 2015, when it slipped to No. 2. Gerzema attributed Amazon\u2019s ranking to its expanding footprint in consumers\u2019 lives into areas like groceries via its Whole Foods acquisition.  Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla climbed from No. 9 to No. 3 on the strength of sending Tesla Roadster into space aboard a SpaceX rocket - despite fleeting success delivering cars on time on earth, Gerzema said.  \u201cHe\u2019s a modern-day carnival barker - it\u2019s incredible,\u201d Gerzema said of Musk. \u201cThis \u2018The Right Stuff\u2019 attitude is able to capture the public\u2019s imagination when every news headline is incredibly negative. They\u2019re filling a void of optimism.\u201d  For its part, Facebook Inc\u2019s (FB.O) reputation improved in the 2018 study, despite being the target of questions from U.S. lawmakers about the role of social media in Russia\u2019s efforts to influence the U.S. presidential election in 2016. Facebook ranked 51st, its best showing since 2014 when it ranked 38th, the highest the firm ever ranked in the poll.  This year, film production company The Weinstein Co made its debut at 99th out of 100 on the list after more than 70 women accused co-founder Harvey Weinstein of sexual misconduct, including rape. Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone.  Last place went to Japanese auto parts supplier Takata Corp TKTDQ.PK, whose air bags can explode with too much force and have been linked to at least 22 deaths and hundreds of injuries, prompting the largest recall in automotive history and forcing Takata and its U.S. unit, TK Holdings Inc, into bankruptcy.  1.

Apple will be told to file the transaction to the Brussels-based antitrust authority, who will take over the merger review from Austria, where it was originally declared.  Big technology mergers involving startups with insignificant revenue usually fall through the EU\u2019s usual net for checking whether deals harm competition across the bloc. However, alarmed that it nearly missed Facebook Inc.\u2019s takeover of messaging service WhatsApp, the EU is seeking to change its rules to allow it to take charge of acquisitions where a target company makes no money but holds valuable technology or intellectual property.  Apple announced its purchase of the U.K.-based app in December, for a reported $400 million, according to people familiar with the transaction, which would make it one of Apple\u2019s largest acquisitions. The Shazam app uses the microphone on a smartphone or computer to identify almost any song playing nearby, then points users to places they can listen to it, such as Apple Music or Spotify Ltd.  The acquisition would help Apple embed that capability more deeply into its music offerings. The company\u2019s digital assistant Siri was integrated with Shazam in 2014, so users could ask it what song is playing in the background.  The EU may be worried that once Shazam is under Apple\u2019s control, the iPhone maker could choose to make Apple Music the only option for listening to tracks. That could divert some of the referrals from Shazam that currently go to London-based Spotify. The acquisition also gives Apple access to a large user data base of people\u2019s musical interests.  Apple hasn\u2019t indicated that it plans to make Shazam an exclusive for Apple Music, but in the past the company has sometimes made acquired features compatible only with its products. It also has sometimes kept support for properties it\u2019s bought, for example, when Cupertino, California-based Apple acquired Beats Music to develop Apple Music, Apple released an Android version of the program.  Apple said it would work with the EU on the matter, but declined to provide further detail. The EU took up the review after Austria, Iceland, Italy, France, Norway, Spain and Sweden all asked it to do so.  The EU reviewed and approved the Facebook-WhatsApp deal after several European authorities asked the commission to step in. Facebook was later fined for misleading the EU during the merger probe. It had told the regulators it couldn\u2019t combine WhatsApp data with its other services but moved to do so shortly after the deal was finalized.  \u2014 With assistance by Mark Gurman", "stock": "AAPL", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-06", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-06/apple-shazam-deal-may-threaten-competition-in-europe-eu-says"}, {"article": "Two pairs of Beats headphones.

Matt Young\u2019s inventive, unsparing, irreverent and consistently entertaining \u201cEat the Apple\u201d is that, but it is also a useful corrective to the current idealization of the American soldier \u2014 or in this case a Marine. Patriotism and respect for the military is so high in this country that we have lately held a national debate over whether professional athletes should be required to stand for the national anthem. Men and women in uniform are given preference in boarding airplanes, and are so routinely thanked for their service that the expression has become rote. Each new season brings a crop of movies and glossy TV serials dramatizing the heroics of our Special Operations.  Young sees hollowness and potential harm in this.  \u201cEnforcing the idea that every service member is a hero is dangerous,\u201d he writes. \u201cLike creating a generation of veterans who believe everything they did was good.\u201d Young warns of \u201ccreating an army of fanatics.\u201d  Service deserves respect, of course, but it does not in itself guarantee stirring and selfless acts of bravery. Young is his own case in point. He sees his experience \u2014 three tours in Iraq \u2014 as far from heroic. He is at least as disturbed by his duty as he is proud of it. These contradictory feelings are a central theme in his book. Years removed, he both loathes and pines for the man he became in the Marine Corps.

That way we can better see what happens when they are deployed. Young writes less about war here than about the culture of being a Marine, one of the few and the proud.

The feature is to become part of Apple\u2019s popular Health app. It will enable users to transfer clinical data \u2014 like cholesterol levels and lists of medications prescribed by their doctors \u2014 directly from their medical providers to their iPhones, potentially streamlining how Americans gain access to some health information.  A dozen medical institutions across the United States \u2014 including Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore and Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles \u2014 have agreed to participate in the beta version of the new feature.

Broadcom typically slashes costs, especially research and development, and the company said it would do exactly that if it acquired Qualcomm. \u201cIn the long run that\u2019s not good for the country or for society,\u201d Mr. Dodson said.  He agreed with the Trump administration\u2019s assessment that, by cutting Qualcomm\u2019s research costs, Broadcom would be assisting Chinese rivals in the global race for dominance in 5G communications technology.  But as an investor, his reasoning can pretty much be reduced to one word: Apple.  Apple has traditionally been one of Qualcomm\u2019s biggest customers, along with Samsung and every other major handset company. But the two technology giants are also embroiled in an epic battle over licensing fees for Qualcomm\u2019s patented technology, with profound implications not only for Qualcomm\u2019s business model and Apple\u2019s profit margins, but for the future of wireless communication.  Photo  If Qualcomm and Apple can just bury the hatchet, Mr. Dodson reasons, Qualcomm\u2019s revenues would soar, and its stock price would climb well past Broadcom\u2019s offering price of $79 a share. By Mr. Dodson\u2019s reckoning, once Apple resumes paying Qualcomm, the chip maker will be worth at least $84 a share, \u201cwhich is why Broadcom\u2019s offer didn\u2019t really engage my attention,\u201d he said.  That, however, is a big \u201cif,\u201d given the intractable positions both sides have staked out.  At the heart of the dispute is the way Qualcomm calculates the licensing fee it charges customers, which is a percentage of the cost of the net selling price of the entire handset \u2014 and not the price of the chip. That means that Apple, a high-cost producer whose iPhone X sells for as much as $1,000, has paid much higher licensing fees than low-cost competitors using exactly the same chip set.  Apple has called the arrangement an \u201cextortion scheme.\u201d It infuriates Apple that Qualcomm has, in effect, been subsidizing its low-cost competitors, including the very Chinese companies that Mr. Trump says he is so concerned about.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Qualcomm has countered that its intellectual property makes many of the iPhones\u2019 distinctive features possible, features that low-cost competitors haven\u2019t replicated, and therefore Qualcomm deserves a percentage of the cost of the entire device.  Mr. Dodson made little immediate headway when he met with a delegation of top Qualcomm officials late last month and pressed his case for a settlement with Apple. The officials, including the chief executive, Steve Mollenkopf, and Paul Jacobs, a Qualcomm founder and, until recently, executive chairman, visited Mr. Dodson in San Francisco to make their case against the Broadcom bid.  In Mr. Dodson\u2019s account of the meeting, he urged the Qualcomm executives to settle with Apple rather than risk alienating it as a customer over the long term. But Qualcomm officials said that Apple was demanding more than they were prepared to give and that, on an engineering level, relations with Apple remained good. They assured him that eventually they would reach a settlement, revenues would normalize and Qualcomm stock would respond.

Still, \u201cI\u2019d like to see them budge\u201d on the licensing issue, Mr. Dodson said. \u201cI can see Apple\u2019s point.\u201d  But if Qualcomm stopped charging Apple a percentage of the device\u2019s cost, it would probably have to extend similar terms to all its major customers. It recently amended its agreement with Samsung without abandoning its approach to license fees. At the meeting, Qualcomm officials told Mr. Dodson they offered Apple similar terms, but Apple rejected them.  A Qualcomm spokeswoman declined to comment, as did an Apple spokeswoman.  Long-simmering tensions between Qualcomm and Apple reached a boiling point in 2016, when Qualcomm halted rebates it was giving Apple. Qualcomm claimed Apple had violated the terms of the rebate agreement by cooperating with South Korea\u2019s investigation into what Samsung and others said was exclusionary conduct by Qualcomm. Apple responded by withholding the license fees it paid manufacturers of iPhones, who in turn stopped passing on the payments to Qualcomm.  Photo  Lawsuits and counterclaims erupted, and Qualcomm reduced its revenue estimates by $500 million a year.  While Apple has continued to buy and deploy the latest Qualcomm chips, it also reached out to a rival chip maker, Intel, which began supplying an alternative to Qualcomm\u2019s chip for the iPhone 7. (That phone, the iPhone 8 and the X may contain either a Qualcomm or an Intel chip.)  Qualcomm claims that Apple has compromised the performance of Qualcomm-equipped handsets in order to mask their superiority over the Intel-equipped phones. (Both Intel and Apple have vehemently denied the claims.)  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Numerous lawsuits are now well underway in the United States, with some expected to go to trial later this year. Regulators in the European Union, Taiwan, South Korea and China have ruled that Qualcomm\u2019s licensing practices are unlawful and have levied fines, decisions that Qualcomm is appealing. In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission is conducting its own investigation.  While armies of patent lawyers fight over the rival claims, investors have already rendered a verdict. Qualcomm shares, after peaking at more than $80 in 2014, dropped by nearly 50 percent, hitting a low of $44 in 2016.  Qualcomm\u2019s precipitous decline is what attracted Mr. Dodson\u2019s attention along with other so-called value investors, who look for stocks trading below their intrinsic value. He said his fund\u2019s average cost per share for its Qualcomm position was about $56, so the fund was still ahead even after the deal collapsed this week. On Thursday, Qualcomm was trading at around $60.  Still, Qualcomm\u2019s performance has knocked the Endeavor fund from its perch at the top of the Morningstar rankings. So far this year, it\u2019s 61st.  Now that Mr. Trump has rescued Qualcomm from the imminent threat of a Broadcom takeover, its financial prospects \u2014 and share price \u2014 will largely follow the twists and turns in the Apple standoff. While Mr. Dodson remains optimistic about the outcome, that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s against all potential takeovers of Qualcomm.  Last week, there were rumors that Intel might launch a bid for Broadcom, which made Mr. Dodson wonder: \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t it bid for Qualcomm? If Intel bought it, Qualcomm would be in good hands.\u201d  \u201cAs a citizen, I\u2019d be very comfortable with that,\u201d he said.", "stock": "AAPL", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-15", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/15/business/with-one-battle-over-a-bigger-one-looms-for-qualcomm-apple.html"}, {"article": "Update: A trusted analyst thinks the Apple Watch 4 will come with 15% more display than previous models, more fitness sensors and a larger battery too. We've also seen a leak that suggests Face ID from the iPhone X may be ready for the wrist.  The Apple Watch 3 is the best wearable Apple has built, and, as it tops our best smartwatch list, it\u2019s arguably the best smartwatch from any manufacturer that you can buy right now.  But, like most things in the gadget world, it\u2019s still not perfect or essential in the way that a smartphone is, so naturally it's expected Apple plans to improve it with a Watch 4.  Below we've put together all of the leaks, rumors and speculation about the Apple Watch 4 we've seen so far, plus a list of things we'd like to see Apple implement in its next generation wearable.  Cut to the chase  What is it? The next generation Apple smartwatch  The next generation Apple smartwatch When is it out? Possibly September 2018 alongside new iPhones  Possibly September 2018 alongside new iPhones What will it cost? Probably upwards of \u00a3329 / $329 / AU$459  The Apple Watch 3 in both black and rose gold  Apple announced the third iteration of its smartwatch on September 22, 2017, so we expect we'll have to wait until at least September 2018 to see the launch of the Apple Watch 4.  As the Apple Watch 2 was released a year earlier in September 2016, that\u2019s our best guess - but it's quite likely. We could be waiting even longer though as the gap between the original Apple Watch and the Apple Watch 2 was over a year at 17 months.  There\u2019s no word on the Apple Watch Series 4's price, but it\u2019s likely to be around the same as the Apple Watch 3 currently is, meaning a starting price of around \u00a3329 / $329 / AU$459 for the smaller 38mm version.  That said, the Apple Watch 3 actually had a lower launch price than the Apple Watch 2, so with all the extra tech likely to be found in the Apple Watch 4 the price could equally increase or decrease a little.  Bear in mind that the price we've mentioned above is just the starting cost. If you choose the larger 42mm band or opt for LTE connectivity, the Apple Watch 3 gets more expensive, as does choosing a pricier case or strap material. All of that is likely to remain true for the Apple Watch 4.  Apple Watch 4 design and display  A trusted analyst that has previous history of predicting Apple products suggests the Apple Watch 4 is set to undergo a big design overhaul.  So far every generation of the Apple Watch has come in either 38mm or 42mm screen sizes, but KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says he believes the Apple Watch 4 will have a 15% larger display.  That doesn't necessarily mean the Apple Watch 4 is going to a much bigger watch - the Watch 3 has a lot of bezel space around the outside of the display, so it may be the company has slimmed this down to fit in the extra screen real estate.  That said, Kuo's report does suggest the company will be including a larger battery inside the Apple Watch 4 that will likely mean the body of the watch will have to be at least a touch bigger to squeeze in the larger cell.  Kuo also notes that the design of the Apple Watch 4 is set to be \"more trendy\", but exactly what the analyst means by this isn't particularly clear yet so we'll have to wait for picture leaks to know more about the look.  Before Kuo's comments, we had seen a patent for a self-adjusting watch strap. This would involve a mechanism that expands and contracts the strap as needed, so that the fit remains comfortable and not too loose at all times, which could also help ensure the sensors on the watch get accurate readings.  The Apple Watch 4 could have a strap that resizes itself. Credit: Apple Insider  It's unlikely to happen on the Apple Watch 4, but back in 2016 we also saw a patent filed by the company for a round smartwatch so we may see that in some future generations of the wearable.  Apple Watch 4 features and spec  One leak suggests Apple will use faster, more versatile circuit boards for its antenna. That's again according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo who speculates it'll mean a more stable LTE signal and better heat and moisture resistance.  Rumors for watchOS 5 (learn more about that below) suggest the upgrades to the OS will be using the LTE signal much more regularly, so it makes sense if the company plans to update it to a faster antenna.  One change that we can predict is the chipset, with a new Apple S4 one likely to be included, though we don\u2019t yet know how much difference that will make.  As for new features on the Apple Watch 4, it looks like you may able to unlock your watch by just looking at it. Apple patents show that the Apple Watch 4 may bring a Face ID camera to make the wearable more secure.  That'd mean you'd just be able to look at your watch to unlock it and avoid having to enter an annoying PIN number to be able to use certain functionalities. Additionally, it would make it a whole lot easier to make quick FaceTime calls from your wrist  Apple Watch 4 fitness  One report from late in 2017 suggests the Watch 4 could get an upgraded heart rate tracker that could embrace EKG technology for the first time.  EKGs, also known as ECGs or electrocardiograms, are more advanced than a standard heart rate monitor and provide more in depth information, by using currents of electricity to analyze your heart's behavior.  The rumor comes from Bloomberg (who spoke to people familiar with Apple Watch 4 plans) but the site also spoke to a cardiologist at the University of California who said the feature isn't intended for those who don't experience heart-related issues.  The cardiologist went as far to say if you\u2019re a \"healthy person\", \u201cthere\u2019s no reason to follow ECG\u201d activity.  There's also an older patent for a wearable that can measure your respiration rate, which could well be a feature on the Apple Watch 4, but considering we've yet to see any further leaks about the feature it may be something included on a future wearable like the Watch 5.  You can expect the return of fitness features we've seen on the Apple Watch 3 including the top-end heart rate monitor and GPS technology as well as the ability to track your swimming with the waterproof design.  Apple Watch 4 OS and battery  It\u2019s also likely that the Apple Watch 4 will run watchOS 5, although again we've got very little information on what that will feature.  One report has said the new software will bring something called StreamKit, which would allow for a Spotify app on Apple Watch. That would be a big deal for those who don't use Apple Music.  StreamKit is a framework that's set up behind the scenes to allow cellular versions of the Apple Watch to receive push notifications from apps. That would mean you'd be able to get Facebook or Twitter messages directly to your wrist, and it's another step toward having a fully functioning phone replacement.  Apple Watch 4: what we want to see  While exact details about the Apple Watch 4 remain a mystery for now, the things we want from it aren\u2019t enigmatic at all. In fact, they\u2019re right underneath these words.  1. Android compatibility  If the Apple Watch 4 supported Android it would have wider appeal  We know this is hugely unlikely to happen, but wouldn\u2019t it be great? It would also help the Apple Watch match Android Wear in one of the few areas where it doesn\u2019t already, since Android Wear offers limited compatibility with iOS devices.  It\u2019s understandable that Apple would want to keep its Watch working only with other Apple devices, since doing so keeps people in its ecosystem \u2013 you\u2019re not going to switch to an Android phone if you already have an Apple Watch.  But that could also put off anyone who doesn\u2019t want to make a long-term commitment to Apple, and it completely rules out anyone who currently uses an Android phone from having one of the best smartwatches on the market.  2. Even better battery life  The Apple Watch 3 actually has quite good battery life, at least by smartwatch standards, easily lasting at least two days if you don\u2019t use LTE.  But that still leaves plenty of room for improvement. Many fitness trackers last around a week or longer and of course a conventional watch will go for years.  It\u2019s not realistic to expect the Apple Watch 4 to do the same, but any gains would be appreciated and help make it feel like less of a downgrade from your analog watch in that area.  Improvements could also make sleep tracking more viable, since currently you\u2019re likely to plug your Watch in overnight.  3. More fitness features  The Watch 3 is a good fitness watch, the Apple Watch 4 could be a great one  The Apple Watch has become more and more a health and fitness device over the years and that\u2019s now one of its main selling points, but there\u2019s still room for improvement here.  Much of this will be handled by apps and software updates, but we\u2019d like to see more health and fitness skills from the actual Apple Watch 4 hardware too, such as sensors that can track your respiration rate and blood oxygen levels.  4. Better Siri  One of our few complaints in our Apple Watch 3 review was about the patchiness of Siri. When it works it\u2019s great, but sometimes commands won\u2019t be heard or interpreted properly and that sort of thing can put people off using it at all, since when it does fail you\u2019d usually be quicker doing the thing by hand.  So we\u2019d like Siri on the Apple Watch 4 to work better. That\u2019s probably largely a software or connectivity hurdle, which could mean any improvements will reach older models too.  Another option would be for Apple to improve the microphone so Siri can hear us better, but that's not really the main issue we faced on the Apple Watch 3.  5. Improved performance  Apple upgraded the chipset in the Apple Watch 3 but it\u2019s still not quite as speedy as we\u2019d like, especially when it comes to loading apps, which often isn\u2019t instantaneous.  Much of the time the Apple Watch\u2019s whole purpose is to be a faster, simpler alternative to getting out your phone, but if you\u2019re waiting for apps to load it\u2019s arguably not.  So we hope the chipset in the Apple Watch 4 \u2013 likely to be called the Apple S4 \u2013 will offer the sort of smooth performance we get with an iPhone 8 or iPhone X.  6. A circular option  Not everyone wants a square watch, so we'd like to see a circular option  On the scale of things that are going to happen this ranks way above Android compatibility but below most other things.  Apple seems happy with the design of the Watch and hasn\u2019t substantially changed it in the various versions it\u2019s launched so far, so we don\u2019t expect a redesign any time soon, let alone a completely different screen shape.  But having a circle as an option would be nice. Conventional watches often have a circular face, as do many Android Wear ones, so to appeal to more buyers it would make some sense to offer the choice.  The issue is it would mean reworking the interface a bit, which Apple probably doesn't want to do.  7. Heart rate insights  The heart rate monitor in the Apple Watch 3 is fairly impressive, as it can keep a record of things like your heart rate ranges when working out, your heart rate variability and your daily resting heart rate, as well as your beats per minute, but it doesn\u2019t do much with the information.  It would be good if the Apple Watch 4 \u2013 or a software update on previous models \u2013 added insights into what these stats actually mean and how you can affect them, because that would turn some graphs into genuinely usable information.  Given WatchOS 4 already brings the ability to poke you to be more active at times that are helpful to you, using this heart rate data to help you get fitter (by suggesting slightly longer walks, or congratulating you on lowering your resting heart rate with reasons it's happened) would be excellent.", "stock": "AAPL", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-28", "source": "techradar", "url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/apple-watch-4-release-date"}, {"article": "The new iPad is great tablet for those that want just that: a tablet. It's shorn of the power and performance of the iPad Pro range, but the addition of Apple Pencil compatibility and the A10 chipset bring it pretty close, and for a lot less cash. It irks that you need to buy the Pencil separately to unlock a key feature, and design-wise we're seeing something pretty old-school here\u2026 but for the price it's hard to criticize too much, and this is still the best tablet on the market.  The new iPad for 2018 is designed to achieve one thing: deliver the best of Apple\u2019s tablet efforts at a more affordable price.  Note that we say more affordable, rather than cheap \u2013 because the cost is still higher than many other tablets out there \u2013 but the new upgrades bring a lot to the iPad, bridging the gap between a \u2018standard\u2019 slate and the more impressive iPad Pro range.  Support for the Apple Pencil adds another dimension to the tablet, enabling a new method of interaction and bringing with it a slew of new apps to interact with, and the upgraded chipset inside \u2013 the same one that powered the iPhone 7 \u2013 offers more power than many will know what to do with.  The upshot? You\u2019ve now got a hugely capable tablet, one with more power and offering more possibilities, at a fairly reasonable price point.  You may be thinking that this is a \u2018student\u2019s iPad\u2019, as Apple has made a big deal about the new tablet's classroom credentials, but in reality most of the people who buy it will be those who want something to use on the commute and around the house \u2013 and as you\u2019ll see, it fares pretty well in those respects.  While this might all sound impressive, it\u2019s still not the full picture, as all these features are combined with the best tablet platform out there, iOS \u2013 there\u2019s a reason the iPad has sat atop our best tablet rankings for so long.  The new iPad was launched in March 2018, and comes with a range of storage and connectivity options.  The new iPad 2018 price starts at $329 (\u00a3319, AU$469), but schools will get a discount in the UK and US of around 10%.  At $329 (AU$469) the new iPad price is exactly the same as the starting price of the new iPad (2017) \u2013 and both come with 32GB of storage \u2013 in the US and Australia, while in the UK it looks like consumers are being treated to a discount, as currency fluctuations mean the basic 32GB version is actually \u00a320 cheaper than last year's iPad.  That's for the Wi-Fi only model, with the 32GB slate with cellular connectivity setting you back $459 (\u00a3449, AU$669).  The 128GB version begins at $429 / \u00a3409 / AU$599 for those who want more storage, with an extra premium to pay if you want some bytes of data floating in on the go.  Apple Pencil  Useful addition for artists  Costs extra to buy  The Apple Pencil\u2026 it\u2019s tough to work out whether it\u2019s a genuinely innovative tool or not. We\u2019ve been using it for a few years now, and have found that it\u2019s great for some things, but useless for others.  Also, let\u2019s not forget that it costs \u00a399 / $99 / AU$145, which means you need to pay around 33% of the price of the new iPad, on top of the cost of the slate itself, in order to access the key new feature.  It\u2019s cheaper for those in education, and there is the Logitech Crayon available in the US for half the price (and less functionality), but it\u2019s worth bearing in mind when buying the new iPad.  If you\u2019re looking for something to replace a notepad, we wouldn\u2019t recommend the new iPad \u2013 or any iPad for that matter, as it\u2019s really difficult to write legibly on them, thanks to the way the tip of the Pencil glides across the surface.  Apple could make the glass more matte and ridged to help, but that would make the display harder to see, so it\u2019s not an easily solved conundrum.  The Notepad app is fine, and allows you to write and sketch, and now the iWork Suite from Apple is collaborative, and you can mark-up documents on it (it took Apple far too long to enable this feature, with Microsoft inexplicably adding in mark-up functionality first to its iPad apps.  This would be a lovely feature if, as referenced, writing on it was easy; but notes can't simply be jotted, they require concentrated efforts of penmanship\u2026 and most of the people we work with are on Google Docs, so sharing a marked-up Pages document was useless.  In a classroom environment it will be more useful if a teacher and the students are all on the same platform\u2026 as long as the teacher has immaculate handwriting and patience to write a little slower.  If you\u2019re just underlining sections or pointing to things then the finger is just as good \u2013 so maybe make sure you really need the Pencil before forking out all that cash.  However, where the stylus does become worth the outlay is when you want to be artistic \u2013 there are a few good apps out there for the Apple Pencil that let you color, change the shading of a photo or get pretty deep into some photo / video manipulation.  We had a great time coloring and sketching during our review, and even if you\u2019re bereft of any kind of talent there\u2019s a lot you can do.  The multi-level pressure of the Pencil comes into its own here, and if you\u2019re in any way artistic then you\u2019ve got loads \u2013 and loads, and loads \u2013 of different styles of brush, pen and other drawing implements you can work with.  Just note that most of the time you\u2019ll be charging the Pencil by plugging it into the bottom of the iPad\u2026 it doesn\u2019t look good.  A10 Fusion chip  Impressive power  Comes with 2GB of RAM  We were all expecting Apple to stick with the same \u2018good enough\u2019 A9 chipset from 2017\u2019s iPad and drop the price, but it\u2019s gone up and shoved in the A10 Fusion chip that powered the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, and which is close to the A10X chip in the new iPad Pro range.  That's combined with 2GB of RAM, so there's more than enough power here for nearly any task that most users will want to do with the new iPad, and certainly for emailing, web browsing or watching video.  We noticed some slowdown with heavier apps, for example when processing and opening multiple photos, but we never had to wait too long, and rendering times were still pretty impressive.  That said, if you\u2019re going to do a lot of more demanding work, that\u2019s why Apple has the iPad Pro 10.5 , with the extra power in the CPU and double the RAM.  In our tests, the new iPad (2018) returned a similar single-core benchmarking score to the more powerful iPad Pro 10.5, showing that if you\u2019re not going to be using the cheaper iPad intensively then there\u2019s no reason to spend the extra cash.  It might seem hard to fathom why Apple has thrown in the extra power here, but users will hang onto their iPads for a long, long time (much longer than they would an iPhone), and having more power means they\u2019ll keep running smoothly, and remain upgradeable, for longer.  You\u2019ll be unlikely to use most of the power in the new iPad, to be honest, but the upshot it that it runs incredibly smoothly, and apps open and close with ease\u2026 and it\u2019s likely to keep doing that for longer, so you won\u2019t need to upgrade as soon.", "stock": "AAPL", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-23", "source": "techradar", "url": "https://www.techradar.com/news/new-ipad-expected-to-support-apple-pencil-and-future-iphones-may-as-well"}, {"article": "Developers can download iOS 11.3 now (its final version will be available in the spring), and many have noticed that iBooks has been renamed, simply, \"Books.\" It follows the example of the Apple Podcasts app, though that redesign hasn't been met with much praise.

Apple\u2019s dominance in classrooms has faded in the face of cheaper laptop options. Photo: Scott Olson/Getty Images  Apple Inc. said it is updating its entry-level iPad with capabilities designed to appeal to students and new software for teachers, as the company tries to recharge sales of the tablet and shore up its dwindling share of the U.S. education market.  The company Tuesday said its new 9.7-inch iPad includes a faster processor and works with the Apple Pencil stylus, which previously worked only with higher-end iPad Pro models.  The entry-level iPad\u2019s price remains at $329, the lowest-priced tablet available from the company. Schools, which receive discounts on pricing, can buy the device for $299.  The announcement, held at Lane Tech College Prep High School in Chicago, was coupled with software and support capabilities aimed at schools. They included more free cloud storage, a management system to assist schools with creating Apple IDs for students and a cloud-based app called Schoolwork that allows teachers to monitor students\u2019 progress on assignments.  The kindergarten-through-12 market represents a critical opportunity for tech companies to get young people accustomed to their operating systems. Introducing students to those systems could help sway future purchasing decisions that span the rest of their lives, said Scott Galloway, a marketing professor at New York University.  \u201cThe moment you get someone on your ecosystem, and they become fluent in your operating system, the switching costs become very real,\u201d Mr. Galloway said. A lot of consumers start on Apple\u2019s or Google\u2019s operating system and never switch, \u201cso it\u2019s logical to lock them in early,\u201d he said.  Technology companies have been pushing computers and other devices into the classroom since at least the 1970s, and Apple took an early lead with its easy-to-use operating system.  But the company\u2019s dominance faded in the face of cheaper laptop options such as Google Chromebooks from Alphabet Inc. or Windows-powered devices from Microsoft Corp. While many of those devices cost less than $300, Apple\u2019s MacBook starts at $999.  Apple\u2019s lowest-priced iPad, which got a $70 price cut last year, offers the company its best chance to compete in the cost-conscious education market.  But the addition of a Pencil and a keyboard\u2014which are necessary to take many computer-administered tests and could add more than $150 to the price\u2014make the iPad a costlier option than rival low-priced laptops, said Ben Davis, a senior education analyst with Futuresource Consulting.  Despite efforts by Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook to champion iPads as laptop replacements, iPad sales have fallen 40% from their peak in fiscal 2013 to $19.22 billion.  Losing ground to Chromebooks and Windows devices in the classroom contributed to the iPad\u2019s struggles, said Frank Catalano, an independent education technology analyst with Intrinsic Strategy.  The update to the entry level iPad is unlikely to reverse Apple\u2019s slump in education sales, analysts say. Over the past five years, Apple\u2019s share of computing shipments in the $18 billion U.S. education hardware market has fallen to 19% from 50%, according to Futuresource Consulting. Alphabet now has a 59% share, compared with Microsoft\u2019s 22%.  In addition to competing on price, Alphabet and Microsoft devices have gained ground in classrooms by offering a strong mobile-device management system that helps IT departments block students from exiting a browser during a test, Mr. Davis said.  Apple on Tuesday announced a system to enable students to share iPads, so they can log into any tablet and reach their own documents and apps. It said Apple\u2019s school management system would allow schools to create as many as 1,500 Apple IDs in minutes. The company also said it was expanding free iCloud storage for schools to 200 gigabytes from 5 GB.  The new Schoolwork app is coupled with a developer platform called ClassKit that developers can use to create apps that teachers can assign to students. It also announced a new curriculum called \u201cEveryone Can Create\u201d that allows teachers to integrate drawing, music, filmmaking and photography into lessons.  \u201cEducation is such a big part of who we are as a company and has been for 40 years,\u201d Mr. Cook said. \u201cTechnology can help teachers deliver a unique and personalized learning experience to all kids. We\u2019ve never stopped believing that.\u201d  While the iPad remains popular with children and teachers, educators have expressed frustration that they must seek out curriculum apps, rather than getting a simple suite of apps as Google provides, said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst with market-research firm Creative Strategies.  \u201cThey have done a lot on manageability, which will make a big difference\u201d for many schools, Ms. Milanesi said. \u201cWhile price has not changed for iPad, you get a lot more with it.\u201d  Write to Tripp Mickle at Tripp.Mickle@wsj.com", "stock": "AAPL", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-27", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-updates-ipad-with-stylus-support-1522167400"}, {"article": "BEIJING (Reuters) - A former manager for Microsoft Corp in China has been named as the first executive secretary of the Responsible Cobalt Initiative (RCI), which works to address social and environmental risks in the cobalt supply chain.  Christina Feng, who managed the U.S. tech giant\u2019s program for the responsible sourcing of raw materials until January 2017, was appointed to the full-time RCI role earlier this month and will be based in Beijing, Feng said in an interview with Reuters late on Wednesday.  The 28-member RCI, which groups high-profile cobalt users such as Apple Inc, Sony Corp and Volvo, was established under the Chinese Chamber of Commerce for Metals, Minerals & Chemicals Importers and Exporters (CCCMC) in 2016.  It is currently in the process of selecting a premises for its secretariat in the Chinese capital.  Cobalt, a metal used in lithium-ion batteries for mobile phones and electric vehicles (EVs), has shot to prominence in recent months and its price has skyrocketed due to expected growth in demand from the booming EV sector, especially in China.

Now, that group is bearing its first fruit: Microsoft Genomics, a gene-sequencing service developed with St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.  Microsoft Healthcare NExT head Dr. Peter Lee says the challenges are hard, but there are lots of benefits, tangible and otherwise, to this healthcare push.  A year ago, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella tasked Microsoft Research NExT \u2014 the company's A-team of troubleshooting scientists \u2014 with a new mission: Take the company's most cutting-edge tech and apply it to improving healthcare.  Microsoft Healthcare NExT head and corporate VP Dr. Peter Lee tells Business Insider that this new mandate was so broad, it was a little bit like being dropped in the middle of the ocean and told to find dry land.  \"There's no sign of which way is the right way, and you could swim really far in any one direction before realizing you were going astray.\" And, of course, he says, healthcare is a field that many tech companies have tried to tackle, and failed. You might think you're making progress, but \"then you look down and see the people drowning.\"  \"There was a time where we were just floundering,\" Lee says.  Now, though, Lee feels like Microsoft's efforts have finally begun to bear fruit, in the form of real, actual products that are making a difference to healthcare organizations, hospitals \u2014 and patients' lives.  For instance, on Wednesday, Microsoft announced the general availability of Microsoft Genomics, a gene-sequencing service available to doctors and researchers via the Microsoft Azure cloud platform. That platform was born directly out of joint research between Microsoft and St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.  Microsoft researchers discuss Microsoft Genomics, the company's new gene-sequencing tool, powered by the Microsoft Azure cloud. Microsoft  \"We already got one product out of this push,\" says Lee.  Similarly, Microsoft is announcing the availability and expansion of other partnership-driven services. Microsoft and India's Apollo Hospitals teamed up for a new artificially-intelligent system for detecting tell-tale signs of heart disease in patient data, for instance; it also partnered up with UPMC for Project Empower MD, a note-taking tool for doctors.  Lee says it's been extremely rewarding: The biggest motivator for his team is getting to make a difference in people's lives. Plus, Healthcare NExT gets to work with cutting-edge technology, like Microsoft's partnership with Seattle-based Adaptive Biotechnologies, which is attempting to use AI to detect cancers and other serious maladies with a simple blood test.  \"It's just cool beyond belief,\" says Lee of Adaptive.  Lee says there are more material rewards, too, as these products open new markets for Microsoft \u2014 important, as some analysts estimate that healthcare cloud computing could be a $35 billion market by 2020.  Doctors, surgeons, and researchers have long needed these kinds of tools, says Lee, and Microsoft is happy to deliver. He says healthcare is becoming a \"very large business\" for Microsoft.  \"We don't talk publicly about the dollars, but it's large,\" says Lee.  Not drowning yet  The key that helped Microsoft Healthcare NExT find its way was to take a bigger-picture approach, says Lee. The starting point was to look at the so-called \"hyperscale\" clouds from Microsoft, Amazon, and Google, and try to picture what the world would be like without them.  With that in mind, Lee says, Microsoft started making bets. The Microsoft NExT \"standard playbook\" revolves around forming individual, internal \"startups\" with their own funding and purpose-driven mandates, so the engineers and scientists on the team got organized and got moving.  Some of those self-styled \"startups\" started using the Microsoft Azure cloud to provide gene-sequencing supercomputing power, resulting in the service now known as Microsoft Genomics. Others focused on neonatal care, or better software for doctors, or improved ways to take patient measurements.  St. Jude researchers use Microsoft Genomics. St. Jude Children's Research Hospital  In all cases, Lee says, the key was for Microsoft to work closely with patients \u2014 as they did with St. Jude for Microsoft Genomics.  \"We appreciate that Microsoft is investing in genomic research and that they took the time to understand and appreciate our unique mission at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital: finding cures and saving children,\" St. Jude CIO Keith Perry told Business Insider via e-mail.  And for his part, Lee says the team has found a lot of \"inspiration\" in working directly with healthcare providers, and the patients they service. In working on Microsoft Genomics, he says, he and his team have made several pediatric cancer patients \u2014 renewing their drive to do better, faster. He says it's \"incredibly motivating.\"  Which is good, because he says Microsoft has \"found its way forward.\" There's no more floundering, he says, just promising movement in the right direction. For instance, Lee's group is now working on an intelligent chatbot for pharmacies that can help patients reorder prescriptions and answer questions about their medications.  As for himself, Lee describes himself as a \"second-year grad student\" \u2014 he's accumulated enough knowledge in the healthcare space to understand what the experts on his team are talking about and make decisions, but not enough to weigh in and participate in the research himself.  Still, he says, he's learning fast. And if he hasn't quite found dry land, he says he's beyond just treading water.  \"I haven't drowned yet,\" says Lee.", "stock": "MSFT", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-28", "source": "business-insider", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/peter-lee-microsoft-research-healthcare-next-interview-2018-2"}, {"article": "Here\u2019s a pretty good way to help spark sales in the post-holiday doldrums of early February.

The updates were spotted by Windows Central \u2014 after all, Microsoft\u2019s not exactly broadcasting the new SKUs.

A new \u201cpersonal space\u201d displays all the items that you\u2019ve been assigned across your apps, like your tasks in Planner or issues in Jira Cloud, plus those from apps you\u2019ve recently accessed, like OneNote notebooks or videos from Microsoft Stream.  Microsoft even added its own new app called Who, powered by Microsoft Graph. This lets you search across your organization for people by name or topic.  The updated version of Teams also makes it easier to launch apps.  It\u2019s adding the ability to query or command an app from the command box to speed up the process of using the apps. That way, you can search for information from an app, then add a result right into your chat in a single workflow. This process will be improved in time, Microsoft says, and will eventually allow you to do more complex tasks, like creating a new task in your PM app or starting a build in Visual Studio Team Services.  Plus, adding information from an app to a chat has been improved \u2013 as you can now add an interactive card from apps into a chat or channel with just a click, instead of having to screenshot the data then post it.  Teams added slash commands with this update, too.  Similar to Slack, the slash command ( / ) lets you perform tasks or navigate Teams. But you can also use slash commands to do things like setting your status to \u201cAway,\u201d adding users to team, or calling a coworker, the company says.  This new set of features is rolling out starting today, says Microsoft, which means you may not see them immediately, but should soon.

Shares fell as much as 5% in after-hours trading Wednesday before rebounding. Link:  Microsoft\u2014Down 0.2%: Microsoft said it recorded a $13.8 billion charge related to changes to U.S. tax law that drove the software company into a quarterly loss but posted big fiscal second-quarter gains in its cloud-computing business.  AT&T\u2014Up 3.2%: AT&T expects to keep an extra $20.42 billion in cash for 2018 thanks to new federal tax cuts, a windfall the telecom giant said it plans to spend on network enhancements.  Qualcomm\u2014Down 0.8%: The chip maker said it has entered into an expanded deal with one of its biggest customers, Samsung, and beat revenue estimates in its latest quarter, though it swung to a deep loss.  PayPal Holdings Inc.\u2014Down 6.5%: News hit that PayPal will lose a chunk of its business from eBay, as the online marketplace said it would start managing the payments flow of buyers and sellers transacting on its website. PayPal also said fourth-quarter profit rose 59% despite the mobile payments company booking a big charge related to the U.S. tax overhaul.

Now it wants to take a cut of their purchases, too.  The U.S. technology company is teaming up with retailers including Target Corp (TGT.N), Walmart Inc (WMT.N), Home Depot Inc (HD.N), Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) and Ulta Beauty Inc (ULTA.O).  Under a new program, retailers can list their products on Google Search, as well as on the Google Express shopping service, and Google Assistant on mobile phones and voice devices.  In exchange for Google listings and linking to retailer loyalty programs, the retailers pay Google a piece of each purchase, which is different from payments that retailers make to place ads on Google platforms.  The listings will appear under sponsored shopping results and will not affect regular search results on Google, the company said.  Google\u2019s pitch to retailers is a better chance to influence shoppers\u2019 purchasing decisions, a move that is likely to help them compete with rival Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O). Google hopes the program helps retailers capture more purchases on desktop, cell phones and smart home devices with voice search \u2013 the next frontier for e-commerce.  The previously unreported initiative sprang from Google\u2019s observation that tens of millions of consumers were sending image searches of products, asking \u201cWhere can I buy this?\u201d \u201cWhere can I find it?\u201d \u201cHow can I buy it?\u201d \u201cHow do I transact?\u201d Daniel Alegre, Google\u2019s president for retail and shopping, told Reuters exclusively.  Over the past two years, mobile searches asking where to buy products soared by 85 percent, Alegre said.  But the current default choice for many consumers is a Google search that ends with an Amazon purchase, analysts said. The new Google program, Shopping Actions, will be available in the United States to retailers of all sizes and could help retail chains keep those customers.  \u201cWe have taken a fundamentally different approach from the likes of Amazon because we see ourselves as an enabler of retail,\u201d Alegre said. \u201cWe see ourselves as part of a solution for retailers to be able to drive better transactions ... and get closer to the consumer.\u201d For consumers faced with a surfeit of choices, the idea is to make online buying easier by giving them a single shopping cart and instant checkout \u2013 a core feature of Amazon\u2019s retail dominance.  Retail chains can also offer products through the Google Home voice shopping device, holding on to those who may be headed to Amazon for better deals and giving them personalized recommendations based on previous purchase history.  A man checks Google devices outside its booth at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, February 27, 2018. REUTERS/Sergio Perez  For example, a shopper looking for sneakers on Google on his phone can see a retailer\u2019s listing and add that to his Google Express cart. Later, the customer can stand in the kitchen, and use the Google Home voice device to add paper towels to the same cart and buy everything at once.  Retail partners saw the average size of a customer\u2019s shopping basket increase by 30 percent, Alegre said, pointing to early results from the Shopping Actions program.  Ulta Beauty\u2019s average order value has jumped 35 percent since partnering with Google, Chief Executive Officer Mary Dillon said. Ulta sells makeup and skin care products from brands such as MAC, Estee Lauder (EL.N) and Clinique.  Over the past six months, Target said the number of items in shoppers\u2019 Google Express baskets have increased by nearly 20 percent, on average, as a result of its tie-up with the internet company.  ENEMY OF MY ENEMY IS MY FRIEND  The retailers are also eager to get in on the rapidly growing voice shopping market dominated by Amazon\u2019s popular Echo home device, analysts and consultants said.  Both Walmart and Target last year struck deals to appear in search results via Google Home.  Smart voice devices like Amazon Echo and Google Home will be installed in 55 percent of U.S. households by 2022, according to Juniper Research. Amazon\u2019s Alexa platform could generate $10 billion in revenues by 2020, a separate report from RBC Capital Markets estimated.  \u201cBrands are looking at Google as the enemy of the enemy and that makes Google their friend,\u201d said Guru Hariharan, CEO of retail technology firm Boomerang Commerce, referring to the competition between Amazon and chains like Walmart and Target.  Target shoppers \u201clove the ease and convenience of making their Target run without lifting a finger by using a voice interface,\u201d Chief Information and Digital Officer Mike McNamara said.  \u201cThis is just the beginning for Target and Google,\u201d he added. Target shoppers will soon be able to link their online account and loyalty card with their Google accounts and get 5 percent off on purchases and free shipping, McNamara said.", "stock": "GOOGL", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-19", "source": "reuters", "url": "https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-google-retail-exclusive/exclusive-where-can-i-buy-google-makes-push-to-turn-product-searches-into-cash-idUKKBN1GV0B0"}, {"article": "Leaders of Apple Inc., Google and other U.S. technology giants head to China this weekend to pursue a familiar goal: To do more business in the world\u2019s most populous nation. The effort has had mixed results, at best, in the past.  With a trade war brewing between the world\u2019s two largest economies, the goal has gotten loftier still.  Tim Cook, chief executive officer of Apple, Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, and Ginny Rometty, head of IBM, are scheduled to attend the China Development Forum, an annual gathering that helps Western corporations build relationships with the country\u2019s government officials.  Cook is co-chairing the event this year, and Apple has the most at stake in China among U.S. tech companies. Its iPhones and other gadgets have sold well in the country, but revenue from the region fell in Apple\u2019s last fiscal year. The Cupertino, California-based company has also been criticized recently for relocating the data of Chinese iCloud users to state-controlled server farms.  Last year, International Business Machines Corp. announced a deal with Chinese company Wanda Group at the forum. The deal was meant to help IBM expand in the country\u2019s cloud market, though Caixin reported recently that Wanda would stop working with the U.S. company.  Google pulled out of mainland China in 2010 over government censorship of its search results. The company has been trying to return in recent years, but has made little progress.  These hurdles will only get higher if a trade war erupts between the U.S. and China. On Thursday, President Donald Trump ordered 25 percent tariffs on at least $50 billion of Chinese imports, including information and communication technology. He also accused China of stealing intellectual property. China responded with its own duties on some U.S. imports.  Apple could see a negative effect on about 15 percent of its business if China were to retaliate with duties on imports of U.S. products, Loup Ventures\u2019 Gene Munster said in an email earlier on Thursday.  Steve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm\u2019s CEO, will attend the conference but has canceled his plan to speak.  The conference comes just days after Bloomberg News reported that Chinese regulators are seeking more protections for local companies before approving Qualcomm\u2019s proposed purchase of NXP Semiconductors NV. China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce isn\u2019t satisfied with the remedies that Qualcomm has offered so far and has told the company to propose more, people familiar with the matter have said.  China is the world\u2019s biggest market for smartphones and a crucial customer base of Qualcomm\u2019s chips for mobile phones. The San Diego, California-based company won the right to extend its technology licensing business in China in 2015 after paying a fine and agreeing to charge lower rates to local customers on phones for that market.  \u2014 With assistance by Mark Bergen, Ian King, and Gerrit De Vynck", "stock": "GOOGL", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-23", "source": "bloomberg", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-23/apple-google-ibm-ceos-head-to-china-with-trade-war-brewing"}, {"article": "To mark International Women\u2019s Day, Google will start letting business owners identify their listings as \u201cWomen led\u201d on Google My Business.

It might not be the most powerful or offer precise controls, but it more than makes up for any lack of depth in unmatched simplicity.  As devices like Netgear Orbi and Eero have shown: the age of routers and range extenders has ended. The future is tri-band or Wi-Fi mesh systems. And, surprising no one, the smart-home obsessed Google is all over it with the eponymous Google Wifi  And, it turns out that Google may have very well crafted the best Wi-Fi mesh system yet. Google\u2019s managed to create a system that offers more mesh units than competitors at a lower price, and a focus on simple setup and management. The result? We never want to look at another router again.  Price and availability  Unsurprisingly, Google doesn\u2019t ask for a lot of money for what\u2019s on offer. Google Wifi costs $279 (about \u00a3197, AU$360) for a set of three units \u2013 that\u2019s one primary \u2018WiFi Point\u2019 (the one you hook up to the modem or gateway) and two secondary WiFi Points.  In the UK, Google Wifi comes with a two unit set costing \u00a3229.  A single Google Wifi unit can be had for $119 (around \u00a384, AU$153). Google promises that three Wifi Points can cover up to 4,500 square feet (418 square meters) in a home.  Unfortunately, at the time of writing, Google has made no mentions of pricing or availability in Australia. However, when we spoke to Google just before the UK launch, it suggested that it was looking to release Google Wifi globally in the future.  Google offers more units for less money than any competitor, like the Netgear Orbi, with all others costing at least $400 (about \u00a3320, AU$520) for the same amount.

Each Google Wifi unit, a tiny, unassuming cylinder with a simple white LED band in its center, is capable of the same functionality.  This means that any of the three units could function as the \u201crouter\u201d of the system, while the others can bestow wired internet (which is beamed to the unit wirelessly) with their included Ethernet ports as well as wireless internet. All three units are powered via USB-C.  Setup is as sublime as Google\u2019s hardware design, using a free iOS and Android app to facilitate the process. While we won\u2019t belabor you with the entire procedure, but the app configures your Wi-Fi network by first scanning the QR code on the Wifi Points connected to your modem or gateway and power.  From there, the app tells you to name your network and set a password, then pair the additional Wifi Points and label them in the app for reference. Again, it takes seconds for the \u201crouter\u201d to recognize the Wifi Points and for them to begin broadcasting.  But, you\u2019re not going to get the same depth of access as even Netgear Orbi provides, so no band switching for you. However, Google Wifi handles this in the background automatically.  However, the app offers plenty more useful features, like constant monitoring of your network, its Points and the devices connected to it. The app has an included internet speed test similar to that of Ookla\u2019s, a mesh test that measures the health of your Points\u2019 connections as well as a Wi-Fi test that measures your connection strength from within the network.  You can also prioritize bandwidth to one device for a time, control smart home devices and pause internet access to certain devices in a family setting \u2013 all from within this app.  By far, this is the most complete and elegant suite of control settings we\u2019ve seen from a Wi-Fi mesh system so far, despite its lack of dropdown boxes and toggles.  Benchmarks Here is how the Google Wifi fared in our brief suite of tests (conducted on a 100Mbps service): Ookla Speed Test 5GHz (Download | Upload): Within 5 feet/1.52 meters; no obstructions: 101.41 | 117.83 Mbps Within 13 feet/3.96 meters; three plaster walls: 97.05 | 118.67 Mbps Ookla Speed Test 2.4GHz (Download | Upload): Within 5 feet/1.52 meters; no obstructions: 47.53 | 96.72 Mbps Within 13 feet/3.96 meters; three plaster walls: 50.95 | 82.98 Mbps 1.5GB Steam download 5GHz (peak speed): Within 5 feet/1.52 meters; no obstructions: 12.6 MB/s Within 13 feet/3.96 meters; three plaster walls: 12.2 MB/s 1.5GB Steam download 2.4GHz (peak speed): Within 5 feet/1.52 meters; no obstructions: 7.2 MB/s Within 13 feet/3.96 meters; three plaster walls: 8.8 MB/s  Performance  We\u2019ve seen just as impressive, if not better, performance from the Google Wifi system as we have Netgear Orbi. Google Wifi draws the absolute most from our 100Mbps Wi-Fi service that we\u2019ve seen any router able to, but can do so from every room of our, albeit small, house.  We\u2019ve been able to stream 4K video through Netflix to our Roku Premiere in the basement as well as we\u2019ve been able to play Overwatch in the office where the modem is located: without issue. Wi-Fi mesh systems like Google Wifi aren\u2019t focused so much about throughput as they are coverage, but this product delivers regardless.  The traffic prioritization feature can ensure that your gaming session is getting more of that crucial bandwidth than the other devices in your house that are Facebooking and streaming HD video.  Plus, the network can automatically repair itself should one or more of the Wifi Points be accidentally unplugged or otherwise lose power.  While we know that Google Wifi operates its mesh system over existing Wi-Fi bands (2.4GHz and 5GHz) over the 802.11s mesh protocol rather than Netgear Orbi\u2019s tri-band system that communicates over a second 5GHz Wi-Fi band, we haven\u2019t found a terrible difference between either\u2019s performance. We do see slightly faster download speeds in MB/s on the 2.4GHz band from the Orbi over the Google Wifi, but that could also be an anomaly.  The true benefit of Google Wifi over others is, simply put, its coverage for the price. You can get equal amounts of coverage in pure square footage from competing systems with fewer units, but the versatility having more units gives you in terms of shoring up dead spots can\u2019t be ignored.  We liked  Google Wifi is incredibly easy to setup and manage on a day-to-day basis despite its lack of some finer control. The fact that the system includes three units for less than some competitors charge for two or fewer is also a huge benefit. Finally, these units look even better in terms of design than systems like Netgear Orbi, and are much easier to hide in plain sight.  We disliked  While there isn\u2019t much to gripe about regarding Google Wifi, some might like finer control over Wi-Fi settings, like controlling which bands are broadcast and when. Also, as it uses AC1200 technology, Google Wifi isn\u2019t capable of the AC3000 or even AC2200 throughput that Netgear Orbi and Linksys Velop are, respectively, which might turn off those paying big for super-fast internet speeds.  Final verdict  Google Wifi is the easiest router that we\u2019ve ever set up, period. And, that\u2019s considering the two extra devices required to complete it. For a relatively affordable price, Google offers more units than most competitors and the best setup and management app by far.  For all of the finer hardware controls it lacks, Google considered every toggle and test it could present in an easily understandable way through its app. (There\u2019s even bandwidth priority control.) Couple that with a hardware design that\u2019s easier to hide in plain sight than any we\u2019ve seen yet, and you\u2019re looking one of the best Wi-Fi systems that money can buy today.

Get past the absurdity of his framing his grievance in terms of identity politics\u2014he\u2019s a victim of Google\u2019s failure to honor \u201cviewpoint diversity.\u201d Apparently under California law this is a legitimate claim.  Last year\u2019s firing episode at first seemed a case of Google clumsily suppressing dissent over race and gender policies adopted after the company\u2019s workforce was found to be overwhelmingly white and male. Now it seems like something else.  If the postings and emails cited in Mr. Damore\u2019s lawsuit are a reliable indication, founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page have lost control of the culture. Google\u2019s leaders may even be a little afraid of their employees.  Mr. Damore\u2019s firing last year by CEO Sundar Pichai certainly rang of panic at the time. Google explicitly invites freewheeling discussion and provides internal forums for it. Mr. Damore did not, in his famous memo, object to Google\u2019s diversity goals. His ruminations on biology may be jejune, but unwelcome facts are still facts. Witness the work of David Lubinski at Vanderbilt, which goes a long way toward explaining the recruiting frustrations of many a tech and engineering-based company. Prof. Lubinski and colleagues find that women who are gifted in math and science tend to be broadly gifted, and consequently have lots of opportunities in a wide range of fields, whereas men with math talents tend to be narrowly gifted, and all end up in math-science-engineering fields.  Not that Mr. Damore\u2019s lawsuit, in which he is joined by another recently fired male engineer, turns on the validity of his Darwinian musings. In the postings and emails he quotes, colleagues spew hate at Mr. Damore, apparently without consequence.  We see them giving each other employee-awarded \u201cpeer bonuses,\u201d supported by Google\u2019s \u201cRecognition Team,\u201d for denouncing him. We see Google employees explicitly reject talking to, listening to or working with colleagues whose politics they don\u2019t share.  We see them proposing blacklists. One paints as incapable of coming up with anything \u201ccreative or innovative\u201d any meeting consisting of \u201c40-something white men,\u201d and Google HR approves the sentiment. An employee asks if \u201cmen\u201d were changed to \u201cwomen,\u201d would the post still be approved? No response.  Another posting calls on Googlers to decline to participate in industry panels alongside \u201ccheesy white males.\u201d  One Googler who says he refuses to \u201ctolerate\u201d broad categories of people (e.g., Trump voters) might seem regrettable, especially after it turns out he\u2019s German and lives in Switzerland. When it becomes a competition, a cultural disease is at work. Incipient here is a world that people in Google\u2019s home state are already familiar with. It\u2019s the world of California\u2019s maximum-security prison system, where inmates survive only by kneeling to one identity-based gang or another.  If there is a lesson here for other companies\u2014and don\u2019t take this the wrong way\u2014it\u2019s the value, broadly, of \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell.\u201d  To work together on software, people don\u2019t need a company-supplied forum to discuss their politics, their sexual interests, their cultural antipathies. Offering it seems pointlessly divisive.  Perhaps the most symbolically disturbed posting is one demanding that control of Google be wrested from the \u201chorde of racist and sexist people we\u2019ve already hired.\u201d  To be white and male is not to be sexist and racist. The statement \u201cI don\u2019t want to be denied an opportunity because of my gender and race\u201d is as valid for a white male as it is for a black, gay, female or furry. (Yes, Google\u2019s internal discussion board includes consideration of the \u201cfurry\u201d lifestyle, which involves dressing up in animal costumes.)  Some predict Google will quickly settle to avoid discovery of more emails and postings, including from top management. What seems worse, from a public-relations perspective, is a culture inveterately hostile to the liberal principle \u201cI may disagree with what you say but defend your right to say it.\u201d This can\u2019t be good in a business whose mission is to organize the world\u2019s information.  Messrs. Brin, Page and Pichai likely feel a tad helpless. The U.S. legal system imposes a need to be race-aware, gender-aware, etc.\u2014to require quotas in all but name, since quotas are illegal. Google simultaneously faces lawsuits and regulatory investigations directed at its alleged shortchanging of women on pay and promotions.  Its internal mood may also partly be a victim of self-esteem run amok. It\u2019s a wonder many Googlers don\u2019t worship Donald Trump \u2014he also can\u2019t tolerate to be disagreed with. A good, old-fashioned Presbyterian horror of self-righteousness, once a feature of American life, is nowhere to be seen.  Part of growing up is learning to live with your emotions; today\u2019s shortcut is to believe whatever your feelings are, they\u2019re justified. Humanity never met a dictator or demagogue who said, \u201cI\u2019m a bad person.

FILE PHOTO: Facebook Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks on stage during the annual Facebook F8 developers conference in San Jose, California, U.S., April 18, 2017. REUTERS/Stephen Lam/File Photo  The company, which has more than 2 billion monthly users, said its members, not experts or Facebook executives, would determine how news outlets rank in terms of trustworthiness. It also said it would put an emphasis on local news sources.  The move is likely to send shockwaves through the media landscape in nearly every country, given the ubiquity of the world\u2019s largest social network and how central it has become in some places to the distribution of news.  Zuckerberg said on Friday he expects recently announced changes to shrink the amount of news on Facebook by 20 percent, to about 4 percent of all content from 5 percent currently.  The chief executive outlined the shakeup in a post on Facebook, saying that starting next week the News Feed, the company\u2019s centrepiece product, would prioritise \u201chigh quality news\u201d over less trusted sources.  \u201cThere\u2019s too much sensationalism, misinformation and polarization in the world today,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote.  \u201cSocial media enables people to spread information faster than ever before, and if we don\u2019t specifically tackle these problems, then we end up amplifying them,\u201d he wrote.  The quality of news on Facebook has been called into question after alleged Russian operatives, for-profit spammers and others spread false reports on the site, including during the 2016 U.S. election campaign.  Two years ago, Facebook users saw hoaxes saying Pope Francis endorsed Republican Donald Trump for U.S. president and that a federal agent investigating Democrat Hillary Clinton was found dead. Facebook initially proposed fighting false stories by letting users flag them.  The change will affect not only links posted by news outlets but also news stories that individuals share, Facebook said.  News organizations immediately began considering how they would fare in the ranking.  FIGHTING FAKE NEWS  The trust ranking will help to address fake news stories, said David Chavern, president of the News Media Alliance, a trade group for old-line U.S. newspapers.  \u201cFor some time, we have argued that Facebook should give priority to news from trusted sources,\u201d he said in a statement.  Tom Gara, opinion editor at BuzzFeed News, wrote on Twitter that he expected partisan outlets to fare worse: \u201cThis sounds like extremely good news for news publishers that aren\u2019t hated by one side or the other.\u201d  Facebook has had a stormy relationship with news organizations, especially those with strong political leanings. In 2016, Republican U.S. lawmakers expressed concern that Facebook, based in liberal Northern California, was suppressing news stories of interest to conservative readers.  Facebook said that ranking by trustworthiness was not intended to directly impact any specific groups of publishers based on their size or ideology.  Zuckerberg said he settled on the idea of surveying Facebook users after rejecting having the company itself rank news outlets\u2019 trustworthiness.  \u201cWe decided that having the community determine which sources are broadly trusted would be most objective,\u201d he wrote in his post.  Facebook said it did not plan to release the survey results because they will represent an incomplete picture of how a story\u2019s position in a person\u2019s feed is determined.  Many factors determine where a post appears in a Facebook user\u2019s News Feed such as subject of the post, who wrote it and who is commenting on it.  Last week, Zuckerberg said the company would change the way it filters posts and videos on News Feed to prioritise what friends and family share.  News Corp (NWSA.O), owner of the New York Post and other outlets, responded to the earlier Facebook announcement with a pledge to look for \u201cany signs that the weighting of news sites is politically motivated.\u201d  The Rupert Murdoch-led company had no immediate comment on Friday.", "stock": "FB", "label": 1, "date": "2018-01-20", "source": "reuters", "url": "https://in.reuters.com/article/facebook-media/facebook-to-prioritise-trustworthy-news-sources-idINKBN1F82M8"}, {"article": "PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen called a rival \u201ccrazy and stupid\u201d on Tuesday over his petition to try to get Facebook to release details of the way the Southeast Asian country\u2019s ruler has used social media.

REUTERS/Adnan Abidi  Former opposition leader Sam Rainsy\u2019s legal team filed the lawsuit in California last week, saying that Hun Sen was using the platform to commit human rights abuses and deceive the electorate.

Hun Sen said he had no idea who had liked his own page.  The case has drawn attention to the central role of Facebook in political discussion in Cambodia, where the government has shut the main opposition party, arrested its leader and cracked down on media and civil rights groups over the past year.

MLB owners unanimously approved the move, the league said. Neither MLB nor Facebook disclosed the financial terms, though people with knowledge of the matter put the price at $30 million to $35 million. They asked not to be identified because the terms are private.  \u201cMuch like the migration of sports from broadcast to cable, you\u2019re reaching these milestones where the combination of the financial incentive and the audience allow you to make the next great leap,\u201d said Lee Berke, an industry consultant. \u201cThis is part of the next great leap.\u201d  The games add to Facebook\u2019s growing sports lineup. Last year, the company struck deals with Fox Sports to stream the UEFA Champions League and with Univision to broadcast live games from Mexico\u2019s top soccer league. The company also had 20 non-exclusive MLB games last season and acquired exclusive rights to stream 47 college basketball games involving smaller conferences this year.  With 1.4 billion active daily users, the world\u2019s biggest social network is also still growing, in contrast with conventional TV networks that have been losing viewers and advertising. Facebook\u2019s ad revenue last year totaled $40 billion.  Weekday Afternoons  All of the games will take place on weekday afternoons, primarily Wednesdays. The agreement begins with the April 4 game between the Philadelphia Phillies and New York Mets. Viewers will be able to watch on smartphones, tablets, computers and other connected devices, including home TVs.  The games will be produced by the MLB Network, meaning they\u2019ll have a broadcast look and feel. For Facebook, however, the rights allow for experimentation with things like social integration and graphics during the broadcast, enhancements popular with younger viewers drawn to digital platforms.  Facebook will also have rights to show the baseball games globally, though they won\u2019t be exclusive outside the U.S. MLB and Facebook will update the schedule on a monthly basis.  MLB will produce and distribute specially curated content, in addition to each live game broadcast, including on-demand highlight packages for every regular season game, as well as club-specific weekly recap packages for all 30 MLB teams. These will be available on Facebook Watch in the U.S. and around the world.  Football Rights  Earlier this year, Facebook opted against bidding for the National Football League\u2019s Thursday Night package, which Amazon.com Inc. carried last season. Facebook had bid the previous two years. The company did acquire the rights to NFL recaps and highlights, giving the league a way to reach fans on the social media service.

It is true that Facebook\u2019s release of personal \u201cfriend data\u201d into the ozone through Cambridge Analytica remains in the news only because of the prevailing superstition that the Facebook monster allowed Donald Trump to be elected president. The idea that omnipotent technology manipulated the 2016 election has greater appeal to advanced progressive thinking than Hillary Clinton\u2019s explanation that married white women sold her out.  But really, all that is a sideshow. The backlash against this technology, the belief that the creature must be controlled, has been building for several years. Along with Google, Facebook is the biggest web target, so Mark Zuckerberg is about to get torched by Congress and any regulator within reach for abusing \u201cdata.\u201d  Data is the oxygen of the internet. Any online click for any reason inputs data. In the beginning this data, organized into things like family Facebook groups or Google Maps or Wikipedia, was seen as good.  For several years BTTP\u2014BTTP being human history Before The Trump Presidency \u2014articles and books poured forth describing the dark side of this technology. In the past year, that criticism has reached critical mass.  Researchers and parents agree that social media is distorting the lives of young people, especially adolescent girls. No one knows what to do about it.  Web forums fill with millions of young men exchanging sexual and political rants. No one knows what to do about it.  Terrorists wallow in jihadist videos on YouTube, brainwashing themselves into acts of mass murder. No one knows what to do about it.  People write articles saying they have forgotten how to read books.  Major advertisers accuse social-media companies of allowing their ads to appear alongside pornography, a bog beyond anyone\u2019s control.  The cyberwarfare spies of Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency ran around the U.S. uncaught for years.  Social media\u2019s contribution to the Arab Spring and Ukraine\u2019s Orange Revolution was an era ago. The technology has been captured since by dictators who use it as an instrument of surveillance and control that would startle Philip K. Dick.  In one week, Facebook the good communitarian has become Facebook the abuser of everyone\u2019s privacy.  The story of Frankenstein endures as a metaphor of good intentions gone haywire because it keeps happening. Some people used to argue that because Albert Einstein explained how energy could be released from atoms, he bore responsibility for the atomic bomb. By this logic blame should fall on Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, for electing Donald Trump.  Do not for a moment think that Mr. Zuckerberg, Mr. Berners-Lee or any of the others who created modern life online are unaware that history may conclude their creations were a mistake.  Mr. Berners-Lee, reacting to the Facebook mess, accused social-media companies of abusing his creation: \u201cThe fact that power is concentrated among so few companies has made it possible to weaponize the web at scale.\u201d  \u201cWeaponize\u201d evokes the idea of dual-use technology, which is tech that can be put to both a peaceful and military purpose, such as rocket guidance systems. The internet has finally been recognized as a dual-use technology, good and bad.  Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s CEO and inheritor of Steve Jobs\u2019s creations, weighed in this week, ironically from China, the global leader in Orwellian surveillance systems. \u201cThe ability of anyone to know what you\u2019ve been browsing about for years,\u201d said Mr. Cook, \u201cwho your contacts are, who their contacts are, things you like and dislike and every intimate detail of your life\u2014from my own point of view it shouldn\u2019t exist.\u201d Of course, the iPhone became the universal gateway into this dystopia.  One can imagine that when Sergey Brin and Larry Page created Google\u2019s early motto, \u201cDon\u2019t Be Evil,\u201d they sensed what Robert Oppenheimer and his colleagues on the Manhattan Project knew: The power of what they had created might be a problem.  Back when superstition ruled the world, the solution to a larger-than-life problem was known as forcing the genie back into the bottle. Today, when algorithms rule the world, one would think that an industry with aggregate IQ greater than any ever assembled could figure this out. But maybe IQ correlates with the problem.  If the issue is privacy, why does every app and site incentivize users to scroll past pages of legal boilerplate to hit \u201cI Agree,\u201d rather than writing up top in large type: \u201cTHIS IS THE ONE SENTENCE YOU\u2019VE GOTTA THINK ABOUT BEFORE YOU AGREE\u201d?

Elon Musk, in a testy Twitter exchange, said he is \u201cback to sleeping at the factory\u201d while trying to fix production delays with the Model 3 electric car. It\u2019s a move reminiscent of Tesla\u2019s last vehicle launch\u2014the Model X\u2014when Musk famously kept a sleeping bag near the production line so he could immediately address any hiccups.  \u201cCar biz is hell,\u201d Musk said.  The posts on Twitter came as investors await Tesla\u2019s first-quarter production numbers, which are expected to fall short of company forecasts. The exchange, with a reporter at the Information, a tech and business news site, followed a story by the outlet that Musk had taken over Model 3 production from Tesla\u2019s head of engineering, Doug Field.  For the past year, Field has managed engineering of both the vehicle and its production. Musk said Field had originally been tasked with both jobs to ensure Tesla doesn\u2019t design cars that are \u201ccrazy hard to build,\u201d but now that the company was back in the thick of production, \u201cit\u2019s better to divide and conquer.\u201d  Tesla Inc. is under enormous pressure to build the Model 3 fast enough to meet customer demand\u2014and to bring in revenue to offset billions of dollars spent preparing for its rollout. An experimental tracking model developed by Bloomberg estimates that Tesla was able to produce 9,285 Model 3s for the quarter and achieved a final burst of production of as many as 2,200 cars a week. Musk had vowed to reach 2,500 a week by the end of the first quarter\u2014a target that was already scaled back from a prior forecast of 5,000 a week by the end of 2017.  See more about the Bloomberg Model 3 Tracker here.  Tesla has built up a die-hard fan base, with some half a million people putting down $1,000 reservations for the Model 3 since it was unveiled two years ago. But the company is still trying to prove it has what it takes to be a true mass-production company. Tesla reports production and delivery results within a few days of each quarter ending.  When Tesla rolled out the Model X in late 2015, it was years behind schedule, and production was marred by problems with its complicated falcon wing doors, custom mono-post rear seats and other unique new high-tech features. Musk told investors in 2016 that he kept a sleeping bag on hand and moved his desk to wherever the factory problems were most troublesome.  It\u2019s not clear where Tesla\u2019s current bottlenecks reside. During a first-quarter earnings call, Musk said the primary holdup was with robots at the company\u2019s battery Gigafactory near Reno, Nevada. A new production line had been built for it at Tesla\u2019s Grohmann Automation labs in Germany and was scheduled to be installed at the Gigafactory last month. If Musk is instead camping out at the automaker\u2019s Fremont, California, car factory, that would suggest his attention has shifted away from the batteries to car assembly. Tesla wants to double production in the next three months, to 5,000 cars a week. Fremont is where that will, or won\u2019t, happen.  Even if Tesla reaches its first-quarter production target, it\u2019s not clear whether the company will be able to sustain and build off of it. According to Musk\u2019s latest posts on Twitter, the company hasn\u2019t emerged from production hell just yet.

Investors on Wednesday approved what may be the largest compensation deal in history for its chief executive officer, pegged on ambitions to turn Tesla into one of the world\u2019s largest companies as it ventures beyond solar panels and electric cars. If successful, the award could end up being worth more than $50 billion -- a sum so large it might just ensure that Musk\u2019s array of other passions and esoteric side projects won\u2019t steal too much time from his work at Tesla.  \u201cI expect to remain CEO for the foreseeable future,\u201d Musk said during last month\u2019s earnings call with analysts. But he didn\u2019t rule out handing over the CEO responsibilities if a suitable successor would appear, allowing him to focus on \u201cdesign and engineering, which is what I like doing best.\u201d  Musk is also the CEO of Mars-bound Space Exploration Technologies Corp. and has embarked on several other projects of late, including tunnel digger Boring Co. and a brain-computer interface startup called Neuralink. The new award -- which was approved at Tesla\u2019s special meeting in Fremont, California -- requires Musk remain at the electric-car maker either as CEO or executive chairman and chief product officer.  Tesla said in a filing that about 73 percent of the votes cast in person or by proxy at the meeting were in favor of the award, excluding those owned directly or indirectly by Musk and his brother, Kimbal.  Profit Ahead?  Tesla shares traded higher following news of the vote. The stock closed up 1.9 percent in New York. A spokesman for the company declined to comment.  The pay plan helps ensure Musk will remain at Tesla at least until 2028, but several questions loom. The award contains a number of audacious goals and no detailed plan of how to get there, including when the manufacturer will turn its first-ever annual profit. Additionally, a series of executive exits in the past year has left Tesla without a clear No. 2 -- a potential concern even if Musk stays front and center.  This quarter alone, Tesla has lost Jon McNeill, president of sales and service; its accounting chief Eric Branderiz; and Susan Repo, corporate treasurer and vice president of finance. Going back a full year, Tesla has also lost executives including Chief Financial Officer Jason Wheeler; Chris Lattner, an Apple Inc. hire who left after leading Tesla\u2019s Autopilot engineering team for less than six months; Kurt Kelty, a senior battery executive; and Diarmuid O\u2019Connell, vice president of business development.  Jamie Albertine, analyst at Consumer Edge Research, said he sees Tesla needing to hire a chief operating officer or a new head of service \u201cat some point in the near future.\u201d Musk said on the earnings call last month that McNeill\u2019s department would report directly to him and that \u201cthere are no plans to search for a replacement,\u201d even as some investors fear he\u2019s spreading himself too thin. In 2016, Musk said he was working so hard, he kept a sleeping bag in a conference room adjacent to Tesla\u2019s production line in Fremont.  Billionaire Bait  The award, which won\u2019t vest unless a set of ambitious financial goals are met, had been cheered by some large Tesla investors who said it would help the CEO drive the business forward. Critics, including the two largest proxy advisers, said it was too costly and questioned why Musk, a billionaire who has about half his wealth tied up in company stock, needed more equity to stay motivated.  The board needed majority approval to make the grant, which likely is the largest one-time compensation deal ever awarded. Tesla had said Musk and his brother, who\u2019s a company director, wouldn\u2019t vote their shares.  Tesla Targets Musk's award will pay when Tesla hits pairs of goals, with one tied to market value Source: Proxy filing  Under the new plan, Musk will earn one-12th of the options every time Tesla hits a pair of goals: one tied to its market value and the other linked to either revenue or earnings excluding certain charges. For Musk to get all the options, Tesla would have to become worth $650 billion -- more than Facebook Inc. -- and produce more revenue than Procter & Gamble Co.  Tesla has said in regulatory filings that Musk\u2019s award could yield him more than $50 billion if all goals are achieved. Some investors have said the package aligns with their interests, signaling they don\u2019t mind if Musk gets wealthier, as long as they also see big returns.  Ross Gerber tweet to Elon Musk and Tesla Inc. Source: @GerberKawasaki/Twitter Inc.  Large shareholders including Baillie Gifford & Co. and T. Rowe Price Group Inc. signaled ahead of the vote that they would probably support the package. Spokesmen for Baillie Gifford and Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. were not immediately available to comment. T. Rowe Price and shareholder Fidelity, which holds almost 10 percent of Tesla stock, declined to comment.  Potential Dilution  California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, the second-largest pension fund in the U.S., didn\u2019t support the plan, citing concerns about potential dilution and an absence of profitability goals. Large stock awards can be costly for investors in two ways: They can increase a company\u2019s expenses and they dilute the stakes of existing shareholders.

Tesla's semi-autonomous driver assist system that handles some tasks and allows drivers under certain conditions to take their hands off the wheel.  The system requires drivers to keep their hands on the steering wheel, and emits escalating alerts if they don't.  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said on Tuesday it was sending two investigators to examine the crash of a Tesla vehicle apparently traveling in semi-autonomous mode and a fire truck in California.  In a post on Twitter, the federal safety agency said the \"field investigation\" would examine both driver and vehicle factors in Monday's accident.  This is the second time the safety board has probed a Tesla crash that may be linked to Autopilot, Tesla's semi-autonomous driver assist system that handles some tasks and allows drivers under certain conditions to take their hands off the wheel for extended periods.  The Culver City, California fire department said in a Twitter post that on Monday an engine was struck by a Tesla \"traveling at 65 mph. The driver reports the vehicle was on Autopilot. Amazingly there were no injuries.\"  The NTSB faulted Tesla in a prior fatal Autopilot crash.  In September, the NTSB chairman said \"operational limitations\" in the Tesla Model S played a \"major role\" in a May 2016 crash that killed a driver using the vehicle's semi-autonomous system.  The limits on the system include factors such as Tesla being unable to ensure driver attention even when the car is traveling at high speeds, ensuring Autopilot is used only on certain roads and monitoring driver engagement, NTSB said in September.  The NTSB recommended auto safety regulators and automakers take steps to ensure that semi-autonomous systems are not misused.  \"System safeguards were lacking,\" NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said.  Tesla declined to comment Tuesday on the new probe. In September the company said, \"Autopilot significantly increases safety,\" citing an earlier government study that suggested the system reduced the incidence of crashes.  The company has emphasized that \"Autopilot is not a fully self-driving technology and drivers need to remain attentive at all times.\"  Joshua Brown, a 40-year-old Ohio man, was killed near Williston, Florida, when his Model S collided with a truck while it was engaged in the Autopilot mode.  The fatal incident raised questions about the safety of systems that can perform driving tasks for extended stretches of time with little or no human intervention, but which cannot completely replace human drivers.  The NTSB said Tesla could have taken further steps to prevent the system's misuse, and faulted the driver for not paying attention. The agency said the Autopilot system operated as designed but did not ensure drivers paid adequate attention.

In addition, the company has set a dozen revenue and adjusted profit goals. Mr. Musk would receive 1.68 million shares, or about 1 percent of the company, only after he reaches milestones for both.  But to put these numbers in perspective, Tesla is worth only about $59 billion today.  If Mr. Musk were somehow to increase the value of Tesla to $650 billion \u2014 a figure many experts would contend is laughably impossible and would make Tesla one of the five largest companies in the United States, based on current valuations \u2014 his stock award could be worth as much as $55 billion (assuming the company does not issue any more shares over the next decade, which is unrealistic). Even reaching several of the milestones would bring him billions.  Mr. Musk\u2019s critics \u2014 and there are many \u2014 are likely to contend that the new compensation plan is just the company\u2019s latest publicity stunt. He has been called a modern-day P.T. Barnum who has created the illusion of success while consistently missing production estimates. The company continues to lose money; at one point last year, it was losing almost a half-million dollars an hour, according to Bloomberg News. Jim Chanos, a short-seller who has bet against Tesla\u2019s shares \u2014 and has thus far been on the losing side of that trade \u2014 has contended that Tesla is worthless.  But Mr. Musk\u2019s compensation plan is no illusion: He gets paid only if the company succeeds over the long term with significant gains in market cap. And it\u2019s impossible for him to manipulate the system by trying to prop up the stock price for a temporary period. Under the terms of the arrangement, even once his shares vest, he has to hold them an additional five years before he is allowed to sell them.  The way the arrangement is structured, each milestone is a blunt instrument: He either reaches it or gets nothing.  \u201cIf all that happens over the next 10 years is that Tesla\u2019s value grows by 80 or 90 percent, then my amount of compensation would be zero,\u201d he said. (His calculations were based on the stock price at the beginning of this year when the company was worth about $50 billion.)  Still, he contended, \u201cI actually see the potential for Tesla to become a trillion-dollar company within a 10-year period.\u201d  Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Many other companies have installed outsize packages that often come at the expense of shareholders because the executives get paid even when they underperform their peers.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Asked how he thinks shareholders should feel about Mr. Musk\u2019s new pay package, Ira Ehrenpreis, chairman of Tesla\u2019s compensation committee, told me, \u201cIt\u2019s heads you win, tails you don\u2019t lose,\u201d meaning if Mr. Musk is gaining billions then shareholders are winning, too. And if Mr. Musk does not perform, shareholders pay nothing.  Mr. Musk\u2019s new compensation plan is similar to the previous one put in place when the company was worth $3.2 billion in 2012. Only now, the numbers are much larger. That package also paid Mr. Musk only when he reached certain market value and operational benchmarks. And virtually nobody could imagine Tesla would be worth 17 times what it was back then.  Mr. Musk has reached all but one of the metrics in that plan.  Even though Mr. Musk\u2019s shares have vested, he has not sold them except to pay the taxes on the grants. His current stake is worth $13 billion.  Mr. Musk does not take a salary, although under California State law, Tesla is required to pay him at least minimum wage. Tesla sends him checks that pay him a little more than $37,000 annually. \u201cI don\u2019t cash it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just ends up accumulating in a Tesla bank account somewhere.\u201d  To afford to live, Mr. Musk has borrowed against his shares, a practice that some corporate executives have questioned. Mr. Musk insists that the loans are such a small portion of his stake in the company that even if Tesla shares were to fall precipitously, it would not impact him or the company.  If Mr. Musk succeeds in hitting some of his benchmarks, it would also mean that the company\u2019s employees, including those who work on the factory floor, who get paid in both cash and stock, could become wealthy.  Under the terms of the deal, which is subject to shareholder approval, Mr. Musk has to remain the company\u2019s chief executive, though the agreement would allow him to become chief product officer and executive chairman with a chief executive reporting to him. He said he saw that as a possibility only if the company became so large that he needed to recruit a top person to oversee the operations.  Mr. Musk has often said he is not driven by money. So what is it about this incentive plan that appeals to him?  \u201cNone of it is intended for dynastic wealth creation,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reason that it\u2019s important to me personally is that there\u2019s some pretty big things that I want to do.\u201d  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  \u201cI want to contribute as much as possible to humanity becoming a multi-planet species,\u201d he said, alluding to a goal he has talked about often, including having people live on Mars. \u201cThat obviously requires a certain amount of capital.\u201d", "stock": "TSLA", "label": -1, "date": "2018-01-23", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/23/business/dealbook/tesla-elon-musk-pay.html"}, {"article": "\u201cYou have to have a finished car rolling off the line every couple of minutes,\u201d said Mark Wakefield, global co-head of automotive and industrial at AlixPartners, a consulting firm. \u201cAnd each one has maybe 5,000 parts that come from different suppliers and have to arrive just in time, and each car is available in a couple of thousand build combinations with different colors and features. And all this has to happen at a competitive cost. There\u2019s a lot that can trip you up.\u201d  Even as he introduced the Model 3 at an event last summer, Mr. Musk warned that the company would find itself in \u201cproduction hell\u201d \u2014 and as those words proved prescient, he has had to repeatedly dial back his forecasts for how many Tesla could churn out.  Mr. Musk once envisioned producing as many as 500,000 cars this year, and last summer he was hoping to be able to make 20,000 Model 3s a month by December. More recently, Tesla had aimed to produce at least 2,500 Model 3s per week by the end of the first quarter.  But that is more than it managed in the entire fourth quarter, and it has produced fewer than 10,000 in the first quarter, the company said Tuesday.  There have been signs of momentum, however. In the past seven days, Tesla said, it had produced 2,020 Model 3s, a rate it said it expected to sustain in the coming week.  In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Tesla said it expected its output to \u201cclimb rapidly\u201d through the second quarter and reach 5,000 per week in about three months. It added that it was \u201crapidly addressing production and supply-chain bottlenecks, including several short factory shutdowns to upgrade equipment.\u201d  Tesla has closely guarded the details of its manufacturing system, but Mr. Musk has described it as highly automated.

With a starting price of $35,000, the Model 3 is more affordable than Tesla\u2019s other models and a crucial part of its ambitions to become a mass-market automaker \u2014 as well as to stabilize its finances and turn a profit.  But Mr. Wakefield noted that working out bottlenecks and hitches in auto production often isn\u2019t as straightforward as it could appear. For example, modifying one part to make it fit better or stronger can require other parts to be modified, or can alter the car\u2019s driving characteristics.  \u201cIf you make a change to solve one problem, you can create five other problems,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople think you just find a problem and solve it, but it\u2019s not like that. There are literally millions of problems that come up and require thousands of engineers, working in teams, either at the car company or the suppliers, to deal with.\u201d  While Tesla scrambled to work out the kinks in making the Model 3 in the first quarter, deliveries of the Model S and Model X declined by 23 percent from the previous quarter \u2014 to 21,800 \u2014 even as the company reported \u201cthe most productive quarter in Tesla history.\u201d  Tesla said it had been hurt by a shortage of battery packs for its cars, made at the plant it calls the Gigafactory, near Reno, Nev.  Michelle Krebs, a senior analyst at Autotrader.com, said the decline in deliveries of the Model S and Model X might suggest that the allure of Tesla vehicles has somewhat faded. Electric cars make up fewer than 1 percent of all vehicles sold in the United States.  \u201cYou just wonder if there\u2019s enough growth in electric vehicles,\u201d she said. \u201cAt first everybody who wanted a Tesla and could afford a Tesla hopped on. But it\u2019s not the newest thing anymore.\u201d  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  In its statement on Tuesday, the company said that \u201cdemand remains strong\u201d for the Model S and Model X. But a sustained slump in sales of those vehicles could complicate Tesla\u2019s efforts to trim the losses it has been reporting every three months \u2014 including a net loss of $771 million in the fourth quarter.  Even aside from its production struggles with the Model 3, the company has been hit by a barrage of negative news in recent weeks.  Concern has grown over the safety of Autopilot, its driver-assistance system, after a fatal crash on March 23 that occurred while the system was engaged. It was at least the third fatal crash that has taken place while a driver was using Autopilot.  On Friday, Tesla said the driver had not heeded several visual and audible warnings to put his hands on the steering wheel before his Model X hit a concrete barrier. Neither the driver nor the car appeared to activate the brakes before impact.  Also last week, Moody\u2019s Investors Service downgraded Tesla\u2019s credit rating and said the company risked running short of cash by the end of the year.  The company said Tuesday that it saw no need to take special measures this year to raise cash. Its shares closed up 6 percent on Tuesday after the regulatory filing, but they have still shed 23 percent of their value in barely three weeks.", "stock": "TSLA", "label": 1, "date": "2018-04-03", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/03/business/tesla-model-3.html"}, {"article": "Despite this wave of negative publicity, it seems clear that Tesla will rise or fall based on the performance, safety, design and value of its cars. If it gets those things right, all the other issues will sort themselves out. Tesla has already defied skeptics and attracted legions of die-hard fans by surmounting seemingly impossible odds to build all-electric cars that have drawn lavish praise from automotive critics.  That includes the Model 3, which Popular Mechanics named its 2018 Car of the Year. (It was a finalist for Motor Trend\u2019s similar award. That it lost out to the Alfa Romeo Giulia has drawn howls of online protest.)  When my Model 3 test vehicle pulled up to the curb on Eighth Avenue, it didn\u2019t quite stop pedestrian traffic the way opening the gull-wing doors on the Model X had, but I could see why the automotive press is so excited. The interior features a single slab of wood sweeping around the cockpit interrupted only by a touch-screen interface that houses nearly all the controls, many of them voice activated.  With its Zen minimalism, it doesn\u2019t look or feel like any other car I\u2019ve been in. The synthetic-leather seats are comfortable, and there\u2019s ample room for someone my size (6-foot-3). This all comes at a cost: $57,500 for this luxurious long-range version, far from the $35,000 base price that has excited many potential Tesla buyers.  The Model 3 may not have the rocketlike acceleration of the X, but I found it nimble and responsive. I easily accelerated from a full stop into traffic flowing at highway speed, usually a nerve-racking maneuver in a conventional car. Driving the Model 3 was such a pleasure I was reluctant to cede any control to Autopilot.  For someone with decades of experience driving a conventional car, my first taste of semiautonomous driving last fall had come as a shock. The sensation of a vehicle moving on its own was so bizarre that I instinctively gripped the steering wheel, which immediately transferred control back to me.  This time I was more relaxed, willing to see how the car would behave. I gave the voice-activated navigation system a destination (Garden State Plaza, a New Jersey shopping mall about 20 miles away), and the car accelerated, braked, stayed in the center of the lane and maintained a comfortable three-car distance ahead of me, all without my intervention. At the mall, it detected an empty parking place, and flawlessly backed into it.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  One of its most impressive features is the ability for the driver to change lanes simply by pressing the turn-signal lever. The Tesla scans for traffic in the adjacent lane, waits for an opening and then glides into place, eliminating the danger of a blind spot. (Over the years I\u2019ve experienced several close calls involving lane changes and blind spots.)

Although I\u2019d been briefed on its limitations, so successful was Autopilot that I was tempted to let down my guard by not bothering to look in the rearview mirror. That would have been a mistake.  For all its vision capabilities (including in darkness), Autopilot became confused when lanes weren\u2019t clearly marked or split in two or at exit ramps. You can\u2019t simply program the destination and let the car find its way. It\u2019s reassuringly cautious about changing lanes, but in heavy traffic, I would have missed an exit while waiting for it to find a suitable opening, and had to assert manual control.  While heading south on the New Jersey Turnpike, I could see in the rearview mirror a BMW bearing down at high speed. I pushed the turn signal for a lane change, and despite its ultrasonic sensors, the Tesla seemed oblivious to the onrushing car. It started to move into its lane; the driver laid on his horn, and I had to grab control to avoid an accident.  Blog posts indicate that other drivers have experienced the same issue.  The Tesla owner\u2019s manual describes this situation as one that the system can\u2019t yet manage. Tesla said it expected future upgrades to solve the problem, but for now, drivers need to be as attentive to the rearview mirror as with any other car.  Tesla had no comment for this column.  At this juncture, Autopilot is a misnomer, as many others have observed. \u201cThis is not self-driving technology,\u201d said Bryan Reimer, a research scientist and expert on autonomous vehicle technology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cIt\u2019s a collaborative system that leaves responsibility for safety in the drivers\u2019 hands and isn\u2019t intended to let them sit in the back seat or pursue other activities while driving.\u201d Even though some companies have said they plan driverless ride services in as little as two years, Mr. Reimer said full automation was likely to be many years or even decades in the future.  Self-driving automation systems are ranked from zero (no automation) to 5 (full automation). Tesla\u2019s Autopilot is Level 2. It requires drivers to keep at least one hand on the wheel. The car issues a prompt if it doesn\u2019t detect a hand on the wheel, and Autopilot shuts down if there\u2019s no response. In the Mountain View accident, Tesla has said, the driver \u201creceived several visual and one audible hands-on warning,\u201d but \u201cthe driver\u2019s hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds prior to the collision.\u201d  Given that this was my first extended drive using Autopilot, I was hypervigilant, maybe even more so than in a conventional car. I\u2019m told that wears off in time, as using Autopilot becomes second nature. The risk is that complacency contributes to driver inattention. Mr. Reimer and other experts are conducting research into the issue.  \u201cAs technology supplants human performance,\u201d Mr. Reimer said, \u201cthe bigger question is how safe is safe enough. If lane-changing technology is 50 percent more effective than humans, is that good enough? That\u2019s the big question no one wants to answer.\u201d  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  At the same time, he said, he worries that \u201cintense media coverage of accidents like Mountain View will scare people off.\u201d He said it was too soon to draw any conclusions from that fatality, but noted that Tesla\u2019s excellent safety record over the many millions of miles its cars have now traveled suggested that using Autopilot \u201ccan\u2019t be substantially more risky than conventional controls.\u201d (There were more than 40,000 traffic fatalities in the United States last year.)  After investigating a fatal 2016 crash involving a Tesla S and a tractor-trailer in Florida, the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration found no flaws in the Autopilot system. The National Transportation Safety Board concluded that Autopilot had performed as intended, but that the driver had become overly reliant on the technology.  After my drive in the Model 3, my sense is that even with its flaws, Tesla\u2019s Autopilot is a vast improvement over conventional controls, and enhances (rather than supplants) the driving experience. I\u2019m tempted to join the Model 3 waiting list, which numbers over 400,000 customers.  Investors, too, seem to have reassessed Tesla\u2019s recent bad news. This past week, Tesla said it had succeeded in ramping up production of the Model 3, though it still fell short of targets, and had adequate capital for the rest of the year.

People walk by the main entrance of the Amazon Spheres at Amazon's Seattle headquarters in Seattle, Washington, U.S., January 29, 2018. REUTERS/Lindsey Wasson/Files  The job cuts, rare for the world\u2019s largest online retailer, are in the low hundreds, the person said on condition of anonymity. Amazon determined through planning for 2018 that certain mature areas of its business no longer required as much staff for the results it was seeking, the person said.  It was unclear which specific teams inside Amazon were affected. Amazon\u2019s consumer organization includes its retail and marketplace businesses, as well as programs like food delivery service Amazon Restaurants.  Seattle-based Amazon has been on a hiring tear, creating some 130,000 jobs worldwide in 2017 and announcing plans to open a second headquarters in North America, anticipating up to 50,000 more jobs there. Its full-time and part-time headcount surged 66 percent in the fourth quarter to 566,000 from a year earlier. That figure includes employees at Whole Foods Market, which Amazon acquired in a $13.7 billion deal last year.  But many of the corporate jobs are going to areas of soaring profit, like cloud-computing division Amazon Web Services, or areas where Amazon sees potential, like voice-controlled computing.  \u201cOur 2017 projections for Alexa were very optimistic, and we far exceeded them,\u201d said Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder and chief executive, in a statement earlier this month. \u201cWe don\u2019t see positive surprises of this magnitude very often \u2014 expect us to double down.\u201d  Amazon hopes Alexa will become a regular part of consumers\u2019 lives and will spur shopping orders by voice.

Though filled with less import than the company\u2019s $13.4 billion acquisition of Whole Foods Market last year, the deal was the second-largest in Amazon\u2019s history. And like all acquisitions, it gives us a rare glimpse into the way Jeff Bezos sees the future.  In the short term, Ring gives Amazon another piece in its Alexa puzzle and a leg up in its race against Google and Apple to control homes that will increasingly be filled with connected appliances. Alexa is a nice novelty now, great for serving up the weather, reading the news and hosting the occasional trivia game. But it will be really useful when it\u2019s the hub that lets people use their voice to arm their security systems, open locked doors and flash video of the person who\u2019s ringing the doorbell out front. Google understands this as well; the new $229 Nest doorbell will come with a free Google Home Mini when it starts shipping this spring.  Alexa currently works with a host of third-party smart home products. But owning Ring\u2019s varied assortment of video doorbells, security cameras and accessories allows Amazon to accelerate their development and make them exclusive to Alexa. (It bought a similar company, Blink, last year.) Amazon can also do the typical Amazon thing and lower prices, probably by incorporating the optional subscription plans for keeping recorded video into the soup of benefits that is a Prime membership.  There\u2019s also a medium-term benefit to adding Ring. Package theft, a.k.a. \u201cporch pirates,\u201d is a rampant problem in much of the country, one that has required Amazon delivery people to start emailing customers photographs of packages left by the front door, and which, in the past, has forced the company to restrict same-day delivery from neighborhoods with high crime rates. Last year, Amazon introduced a home camera and a service called Amazon Key, which automatically opens doors for verified delivery people. Amazon Key works with so-called \u201csmart locks\u201d made by other companies. Ring doesn\u2019t sell door locks just yet, but you can imagine a day when Amazon owns all the components to make such a service work.  The implications of the Amazon-Ring deal are really interesting to contemplate when we start thinking farther out. We know Amazon wants to deliver groceries. But leaving bags of kale and cartons of milk outside for hours doesn\u2019t work, and many Amazon Fresh subscribers aren\u2019t crazy about accumulating those bulky blue totes filled with dry ice. When Amazon is behind your home security system, your doorbells and door locks, Amazon workers will be able to walk in, unpack the bags and bring the milk right to the refrigerator.  But why stop with groceries? With its endless appetites, Amazon wants to expand in the massive home-services category, fertile ground for companies like Handy Technologies Inc. and Thumbtack Inc. Imagine sitting at school or in your office and being able to buzz in the cable guy or a plumber after verifying they are who they say they are with live video on your phone. Or we can go even further: The Amazon front door and security system could one day open for your trusted housekeeper, dog-walker or exterminator, and no one else.  To keep growing at 30 percent a year, Amazon has to start selling us services, not just stuff. The Ring acquisition, with its smart doorbells and security cameras, is another step along that path. Rivals should beware: Amazon\u2019s move into smart home devices is going to give all new meaning to the words \u201clock in.\u201d  This article also ran in Bloomberg Technology\u2019s Fully Charged newsletter.

He reportedly feels that Amazon is not paying its fair share of taxes, and has previously claimed that The Washington Post is being used to cover up Amazon's supposed evasion, as Jeff Bezos runs Amazon and owns the newspaper. President Trump is also unhappy with how he believes Amazon is hurting the retail industry, and brick-and-mortar retailers in particular.  President Trump does not currently have a specific plan to attack Amazon, and one may never comes to pass, but there are several ways he could go about it.  Antitrust regulation: Amazon captures a huge percentage of US e-commerce sales and e-commerce growth, without showing signs of slowing down, which has led many to consider the case that it is a monopoly that should be broken up. Such a case would not be close to a slam dunk, as it's unclear if Amazon is a threat to competition or considered to be one under antitrust laws. But if it was successful, the resulting regulations would alter Amazon significantly.

President Trump could lead the charge on finding ways to increase Amazon's federal tax bill in order to take a bigger piece of its revenue and hinder the company. Sales taxes:Amazon collects sales tax in jurisdictions where it is required to, but online sales tax laws vary from state-to-state and city-to-city, and this complexity leads to Amazon not having to collect taxes in certain places. Additionally, in many states, Amazon does not collect taxes for sales from its third-party vendors, leaving it up to them. However, many of these merchants are unclear of their responsibilities, and therefore hesitate to charge sales tax. Although some states are looking into the missing taxes, others have yet to make an effort to solve the problem; until every affected state starts cracking down, Amazon's marketplace will continue to have a price advantage over competitors. If President Trump were to make a push for tougher online sales taxes nationwide, it could give him his desired result of a weakened Amazon.  Meanwhile, the company is still selecting the location for its second headquarters, and has fielded bids that could further shield it from taxes. Amazon has received a number of bids that feature tax breaks, the ability to keep its employees' income taxes, and likely much more, all of which would make it easier for Amazon to pay less in taxes. While these deals would be valuable to Amazon, the potentially extreme level of tax immunity they provide may lead to public backlash, which could bring on new regulations and laws that would hurt the company.", "stock": "AMZN", "label": -1, "date": "2018-03-29", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-how-president-trump-could-go-after-amazon-2018-3"}, {"article": "BI Intelligence  This story was delivered to BI Intelligence \"E-Commerce Briefing\" subscribers hours before appearing on Business Insider.

Walmart is now price matching Amazon on 53% of all online products, according to data from e-commerce analytics firm Profitero, reported on by Retail Dive.  Moreover, Target is matching 37% of its products to Amazon's prices, while Jet.com is matching 35%. But, even with competitors' price-matching attempts, Amazon remains a cost leader, as its prices are 10% lower than all retailers' on average.  Walmart has been pushing to undercut Amazon, and its recent efforts have been a success.  Walmart closed the gap on pricing differences with Amazon by the end of 2017, averaging only .3% higher than Amazon from December 2016 to November 2017, down from 3% higher for the same period in the previous year. The retailer has also been using tactics, such as pickup discounts, to help customers save money on online orders.  Walmart's in-store prices are lower than the e-commerce titan's by 10.4% on average. Noteably, Walmart dominated in home goods and kitchen appliances, undercutting Amazon by 33% and 21%, respectively.  But competing on price may hurt the retailer's efforts to increase margins on online orders. Walmart requested that vendors offer more products priced at $10 or above in an effort to avoid taking a loss on shipping small orders. However, this move may counteract the price-matching efforts it's been making, especially among consumers who aren't brand-loyal, as online shoppers may turn to retailers that have a large assortment of low-priced items to shop from.  Walmart could see more success by offering an array of items under $10, but requiring that they be an \"add-on\" to a larger order. This would allow shoppers to get the low-priced items they're looking for, while increasing margins on shipping online orders for Walmart.  These price wars are likely to have a ripple effect across the entire retail industry, as Amazon ramps up efforts across all segments. Amazon is already stealing apparel sales from retailers, with its pricing and discounts being a major attraction to consumers. Apparel retailers are feeling the effect of this, as they struggle to move inventory and are forced to significantly markdown items. Meanwhile, the grocery segment has been fiercely competing to have the cheapest goods after Amazon entered the space via its acquisition of Whole Foods.

Officials from the Fair Trade Commission, Japan\u2019s antitrust watchdog, have visited the headquarters of Amazon Japan to see if any violations of the Antimonopoly Act have taken place, a government official said Thursday.  Amazon is fully cooperating with the commission, an Amazon Japan spokeswoman said, without elaborating.  The official declined to specify why the government was investigating Amazon. But he said that in general, the commission was concerned about cases in which sellers of goods may face harm from spurning the demands of powerful retailers.  The commission was interested in ways powerful online retailers can distort competition, reduce incentives to cut prices elsewhere and gain an advantage over other online shopping mall operators, he added.  Japan accounted for $11.9 billion, or nearly 7%, of Amazon\u2019s $178 billion in global sales in 2017. That made it the third-biggest market for the company after the U.S. and Germany.

WSJ's Karan Deep Singh breaks down the basics with the help of an Amazon delivery box.  As in the U.S., the company\u2019s rapid growth and aggressive pricing has generated wide ripple effects across the Japanese retail industry\u2014to the extent that the Bank of Japan has cited low e-commerce prices as one reason for the nation\u2019s sluggish inflation.  Amazon commanded the biggest portion of Japan\u2019s e-commerce market in 2016, at more than 20%, according to a survey by the Japan External Trade Organization. That scale makes it hard for sellers\u2014already fighting for customers as the population shrinks\u2014to refuse requests from Amazon, government officials have said.  The Japan Fair Trade Commission closed a previous probe of Amazon Japan just nine months ago. The commission said it found Amazon Japan had demanded that suppliers offer Amazon customers prices equal to or less than their prices on other online shopping sites such as those run by Rakuten Inc. or Yahoo Japan Corp.  The commission said the practice could give Amazon Japan the broadest lineup of goods at the lowest prices and hinder competition.  Amazon Japan said at the time that it promised Japanese regulators to stop requiring sellers to match the price offered on other sites. The commission closed its probe in exchange.

Amazon is adding Whole Foods to its one- and two-hour delivery option, Prime Now, in four markets. Photo: Elaine Thompson/Associated Press  Amazon.com Inc. AMZN -1.22% said it would start delivering Whole Foods groceries via its fastest delivery option in four markets, marking the first major integration between its e-commerce operations and its new brick-and-mortar grocery chain.  The online retail giant will add Whole Foods to its one- and two-hour delivery option, Prime Now, in the grocer\u2019s hometown of Austin, Texas, as well as Dallas, Virginia Beach, Va. and Cincinnati, Ohio.  Stephenie Landry, the Amazon vice president who oversees Prime Now, said it plans to expand the effort, but declined to say how quickly. She noted that Prime Now grew to more than 50 global markets in less than three years following its creation.  Amazon\u2019s latest move is one of the first to potentially take aim at major grocers racing to offer deliveries and pickups to better compete with Amazon, along with rival online delivery services like Instacart Inc., which currently delivers from Whole Foods. Grocer stocks were hit hard by the news of Amazon\u2019s decision to purchase Whole Foods last summer, with six major food retailers losing roughly $12 billion in value after the deal\u2019s announcement.  Still, Amazon has struggled in recent years to make its grocery delivery business work. Its grocery delivery arm AmazonFresh was scaled back late last year, ending service in some ZIP Codes. The company\u2019s acquisition of Whole Foods was viewed by some analysts as a way to help address some of those challenges.  Analysts have largely expected Amazon to start offering Whole Foods deliveries since the roughly $13.5 billion deal was announced. Already Amazon pairs with grocer Sprouts Farmers Market Inc. and other outside retailers and restaurants in some markets to offer speedy deliveries.  Amazon wants to deliver everything you want to your doorstep, anywhere in the world. But the e-commerce giant faces several challenges in its pursuit of a global empire. WSJ's Karan Deep Singh breaks down the basics with the help of an Amazon delivery box.  Ms. Landry said those partnerships will continue.  For the new Prime Now deliveries, employees will pick the orders in store from the shelves as they come in. Customers will be able to select from a variety of fresh produce and proteins, and some in-store items won\u2019t be available. Prices may also differ.  Prime Now is available only to the company\u2019s Prime members, who typically pay $99 annually. Two-hour deliveries are free on orders over $35, but tips are suggested for drivers. One-hour delivery costs $7.99.  Amazon has previously lowered prices at Whole Foods and started offering some of the grocer\u2019s private label brands on its website and via Prime Now. It also plans to introduce benefits for members of its Prime program.  Ms. Landry said that Whole Foods and Amazon have been partnering on the Prime Now initiative, allowing Amazon to take advantage of the grocers\u2019 marketing expertise and in-store operations.  \u201cYou\u2019re going to continue to see us doing lots of things together,\u201d she added.  \u2014Heather Haddon contributed to this article  Write to Laura Stevens at laura.stevens@wsj.com", "stock": "AMZN", "label": -1, "date": "2018-02-08", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-to-deliver-whole-foods-groceries-1518066000"}, {"article": "IBM\u2019s Watson Studio is the company\u2019s service for building machine learning workflows and training models, is getting a new addition today with the launch of Deep Learning as a Service (DLaaS). The general idea here, which is similar to that of competing services, is to enabled a wider range of businesses to make user of recent advances in machine learning by lowering the barrier of entry.  With these new tools, developers can develop their models with the same open source frameworks they are likely already using (think TensorFlow, Caffe, PyTorch, Keras etc.). Indeed, IBM\u2019s new service essentially offers these tools as cloud-native services and developers can use a standard Rest API to train their models with the resources they want \u2014 or within the budget they have. For this service, which offers both a command-line interface, Python library or interactive user interface, that means developers get the option to choose between different Nvidia GPUs, for example.  The idea of a managed environment for deep learning isn\u2019t necessarily new, With the Azure ML Studio, Microsoft offers a highly graphical experience for building ML models, too, after all. IBM argues that its service offers a number of distinct advantages, though.

Indeed, three years ago, this whole area of technology did not exist.  Serverless means, from a developer\u2019s point of view, that there is no need to setup or manage server infrastructure running your applications.  This doesn\u2019t mean that servers aren\u2019t involved of course \u2013 they are, but with serverless computing developers are shielded from various server management decisions and capacity planning decisions.  Without having to factor servers into their task load or having the burden of managing and maintaining an infrastructure, developers can focus on what they do best.  What\u2019s more - in the past, they have had to learn how to configure many different services and frameworks including apache, nginx, postfix or php \u2013 just to a name a few.  Now, serverless has liberated developers by allowing them to focus on coding in the languages they best understand. The net effect is that developers have more time to focus on innovation, instead of managing the servers that run their code.  Speed, ease & cost efficiency  So, how is this new tech paradigm being applied? Generally speaking, due to the fact that serverless is relatively new, it lends itself to modern cloud native or microservice applications as opposed to legacy apps. Serverless computing is most suited to low-performance computing workloads due to the limits on resource imposed by cloud providers.  A particularly compelling use case for serverless is for building APIs due to increased speed. APIs are the software intermediaries that allow two applications to talk to each other. With serverless, developers can build APIs without having to manage any back-end infrastructure. If you\u2019re a front end java script developer for example, now you can build an API much quicker as you don\u2019t have to focus on lower level infrastructure operations and understand multiple coding languages.  In addition to developing APIs more quickly and easily, the use cases for serverless computing extends to traffic flow. APIs might get busy every day, but the peaks can be hard to predict. Let\u2019s take the example of a ticketing company \u2013 they will need to cope with huge spikes in traffic when a new show is announced. They will not necessarily need this level of server capacity at all times, but will still need to be prepared for it. With serverless, greater cost efficiency can be achieved as you only pay when requests are coming in and when your code is running.  For start-ups & for large scale enterprises  With lower upfront costs, serverless is great for start-ups \u2013 because they only really start paying when they begin to get traffic. Beyond start-ups, enterprises of any size that are looking to develop APIs will find that the benefits are clear \u2013 not only is serverless better value for money, it is quick, easy to use, and doesn\u2019t involve taking on a huge amount of risk.  Software developers SiteSpirit are a good example of how serverless architecture can help solve a business challenge by optimising processes. SiteSpirit helps clients create picture-perfect marketing material with a serverless media-library-as-a-service. In highly visual industries such as travel and real estate, marketers need quick and easy access to the right images to design compelling campaigns. With this cloud based service, the pain of storing, tagging, retrieving and manipulating thousands of images is removed \u2014and is built on a serverless architecture to keep costs low.  Open-source platforms open up innovation  However, concerns remain around proprietary lock-in as code written and deployed in the cloud becomes inextricably linked with the cloud provider at that point in time. This means that applications become optimised for a specific cloud environment, and moving cloud provider could sacrifice performance and responsiveness of an application. This is why many developers are now looking to open source solutions.  Deploying this kind of higher order tool, as opposed to running numerous functions that run in parallel will be crucial to optimising time spent on actual coding and building game-changing technology in the cloud.  Serverless: Serving the developer community  As serverless architectures are improved and the parameters are broadened, they are likely to become increasingly popular with developers looking to save time, reduce costs and focus on what they do best.  Within a couple of years, serverless is likely to become a default mode for the development of cloud-based technologies, liberating developers from back-end infrastructure maintenance and opening up programming to the many not the few.  In this way, serverless has the potential to provide a whole new way of working for developers; one in which innovation is at the fore.  James Thomas is a developer advocate for IBM Cloud.

At the heart of these digital currencies is the technology of the blockchain, which dates back to 2008. This is distributed ledger tech that provides a decentralized and transparent method for transactions, while maintaining a high level of security.  To date, the most successful application of the blockchain has been in cryptocurrency. However, this same technology will certainly make itself felt across a variety of other sectors \u2013 which should brace themselves for the impending disruption. In this article, we\u2019re highlighting 10 such arenas that will certainly feel the impact of the blockchain\u2026  Check out how Microsoft is making a blockchain that\u2019s fit for business  1. Voting  A limitation to modern elections is that they require the voter to be physically present at the polling booth to cast their vote, which can often make things awkward in terms of finding the time to travel \u2013 and makes little sense in our mobile, connected society. Another bone of contention is the possibility of voter fraud, with losing candidates potentially engaging in legal battles which can delay the result, and even cost the taxpayer when it comes to conducting a recount.  The application of blockchain technology could eliminate voter fraud, providing a clear record of the votes cast, and preventing any chance of a rigged election. Furthermore, this could all be done on a mobile platform, allowing busy individuals the opportunity to cast their vote without going to a polling station. Follow My Vote promises an \u2018online voting solution for the modern age\u2019 via blockchain technology.  2. Healthcare  While healthcare has mostly moved on from paper-based records, it\u2019s still an industry which is ripe for modernization via the blockchain. Current challenges in this sector include keeping patient records private from hackers, while allowing authorized access by providers.  Applying blockchain technology to healthcare records promises improved data security, with better access for healthcare professionals and patients alike, and greater transparency for healthcare transactions. Gem has partnered with healthcare tech firm Philips in this space.  3. Photography  Photographers can face challenges when it comes to getting paid royalties for their snaps, especially in our digital world where image theft is often just a click away.  With that in mind, at the recent CES show in Las Vegas, Kodak revealed its new digital currency, KODAKCoin, which is backed by a blockchain ledger and image rights platform called KODAKOne. Kodak hopes that the new virtual currency will help protect digital image rights for photographers, allowing them to securely register their work.  4. Internet of Things (IoT)  The IoT promises an ever-growing number of online devices to monitor and contribute to our connected lifestyle. But a significant barrier to the adoption of various smart gadgets is the walled ecosystems which some manufacturers insist upon, locking out devices from other vendors, and generally making things harder for the consumer looking to use a variety of different bits of hardware.  In 2015, IBM and Samsung showed off an application of the blockchain known as ADEPT (Autonomous Decentralized Peer-to-Peer Telemetry), which is designed to decentralize the IoT, and allow devices to communicate directly, without a manufacturer\u2019s hub getting in the way and trying to lock users into a particular ecosystem.  5. Cloud storage  Storing data in the cloud has become an increasingly popular and convenient practice, although it still has potential problems \u2013 like downtime and losing access to your data temporarily, or more seriously, the cloud service being hacked.  Storj is a company that\u2019s using the blockchain for open source cloud storage. Users are connected via blockchain and peer-to-peer technology, with a distributed network to store their data on. Folks with spare storage can also rent it out for income via the Storj app, as the storage space is crowd-sourced.  6. Public records  Our governments are entrusted to store a wide variety of information about individual citizens, including a lot of sensitive material such as financial data on tax returns or property records. Much of this information still exists only in paper form, or in siloed databases, and managing this data can be complicated, as it must be available, without error, and protected from hacking and manipulation.  The use of the blockchain represents an innovative solution to encode this data in a digital ledger, keeping the info safe from being altered. In the US, Delaware-based Ubitquity has the first blockchain-based system (currently in alpha) for property record management including titles, which is in testing overseas at the Land Records Bureau in Brazil.  7. Banking  Financial institutions continue to face challenges with identity theft, cost efficiency of transactions, and just general security. The blockchain will certainly digitally disrupt this industry, and holds the potential key to faster transactions, at less cost, and with a higher degree of security. IBM has partnered with Axoni and R3 to develop and deploy distributed ledger technology to the financial industry.  8. Car leasing  Leasing a car can end up being a protracted process, with multiple parties involved in the transaction, all needing to verify information before the car rolls off the lot. DocuSign, which specializes in secure digital documents, has partnered with credit card giant Visa to apply blockchain technology to Smart Contracts that promise a streamlined \u2018click, sign and drive\u2019 approach to securely leasing a vehicle. Now if only they could reduce the price of those floor mats...  9. Music rights  Soon after music went digital with MP3 files, music piracy was close behind, with artists losing control of their work, and record companies unhappy over the lost revenue stream.  The entertainment industry is looking to blockchain technology to secure digital rights for music and other media, with the potential to recapture that income. The British company JAAK has grabbed attention with its effort to create Smart Content with a \u201cglobal view of content ownership and rights\u201d.  10. Worker credentials  When companies hire an individual for a job, they want to get the best qualified person with the most appropriate experience levels. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to discern the truth behind the average resume or CV, as more than half of folks reportedly lie on their job applications \u2013 and indeed one study showed that a quarter of applicants said they\u2019d worked for companies which in fact had never employed them.  This problem also arises at universities that need to verify the credentials of their faculty, and at hospitals that face a similar challenge when it comes to staff physicians and other healthcare professionals.  The Learning Machine is a company that hopes to change this. By applying blockchain technology, worker and professional credentials can be verified and kept in a secure digital ledger, which cannot be altered down the road to fit another position the applicant is subsequently interested in. The firm promises inherent fraud protection which could make choosing the right person for a job a good deal easier.", "stock": "IBM", "label": 1, "date": "2018-01-16", "source": "techradar", "url": "http://www.techradar.com/news/here-are-the-10-sectors-that-blockchain-will-disrupt-forever"}, {"article": "According to IBM Security's new \"Future of Identity Study,\" users of both mobile and desktop are wide awake to what's happening with each new high profile breach, and it's made them change their priorities. Strong security and privacy are now at the forefront of the average user's concerns, especially when it comes to banking, financial, online marketplaces, and their email accounts.  That's a sharp contrast to research from Gartner in 2008, which also surveyed 4,000 people and found that most consumers didn't want to change the way they did passwords or security, and were highly resistant to using password managers or adopting additional security measures around log-ins.  \"Despite widespread security concerns,\" Gartner concluded ten years ago, \"consumers continue to rely on service providers to protect their safety and persist in using unsafe password management practices, preferring to maintain the status quo rather than exploring new security methods.\"  IBM's 2018 report surveyed nearly 4,000 adults from around the world. Most respondents were in the US. Over half said they would never trade security for convenience. Like, never.  That sentiment increased with age. IBM's findings showed that 53 percent of 18-23 year olds were in the \"no trade-offs\" camp, whereas this sentiment increased in older people. At the end of the spectrum where the olds were, 84 percent of people 55 and older said that nope, they'd never ever sacrifice security for convenience.  Sadly it was only people who said this, and not corporations, who are sometimes people, but are always sacrificing our security for their convenience.  Additionally, IBM found that 74 percent of consumers said they'd prefer to use extra security like two-factor authentication, extra passwords, or any other additional step for added protection. If they could, they would. Interestingly, the study said that \"36 percent of those ages 18 - 20 say they use password managers to keep passwords and avoid having to memorize them, compared to only 26 percent of users in the general population.\"  It all comes down to trust. Between Yahoo's flaming 3 billion user security disaster, Equifax's negligent ongoing dumpster fire, and Facebook's endless compromises of our personal security, consumers have turned a corner from thinking that large companies have their security acts together.  Perhaps what's surprising is not that people would choose better security over letting some company make their logins \"frictionless,\" but that they're willing to do something about it. That includes rage-quitting whoever screwed up their security. IBM's report found that in the wake of a breach, one in five users will stop using an affected app or service, or move to a competitor's service. The younger the user, the more likely they'll dump whoever got breached and take their trust somewhere else.  I can only imagine the amount of resentment building against companies people can't switch away from, like Equifax, Anthem (BlueCross BlueShield), or government agencies such as the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).  The debate about trade-offs between security and convenience is an old one. But now it looks like the idea that users do whatever is easiest is just as dated. Now people know the risks. And no one trusts companies with their security or privacy anymore.  \"For apps related to finances (banking, investing and budgeting),\" the study detailed, \"people vastly ranked security as top priority (70 percent on average) over privacy or convenience (16 percent and 14 percent respectively) -- yet when it came to social media, convenience took a slight lead (36 percent convenience, 34 percent security, 30 percent privacy).\"  One of the extra security steps making its way into mainstream use is biometrics, like fingerprint, face, retina, and palm scanning. Samsung is working on phones that scan your palm; LG wants to use your voice; the Galaxy S8 already uses retinal scans. A Dubai airport plans to replace security counters with facial recognition scans. Mastercard is adding fingerprint scanners to its credit cards. And of course, flagship Androids and iPhones all come with fingerprint and Face ID options.  It's all been met with conflicting reactions of excitement and anxiety from consumers, security professionals, and privacy pundits. Their concerns are all well-founded, and as my colleague Cherlynn Low put it, \"After Apple first put Touch ID on the iPhone 5s in 2013, people pointed out that it didn't work very well and that it wasn't secure.\"  Yet IBM's study shows biometric security to be an inevitability consumers are starting to embrace. Its data showed that 67 percent of respondents are comfortable with using biometrics for security, with a whopping 87 percent willing to consider using different types of biometric authentication in the future.  Even still, everyone's biggest concerns with biometrics are privacy and security. According to IBM, 55 percent of respondents are worried about how their data will be collected and used, with 50 percent saying they're concerned about people using faked biometric credentials to break into their accounts.  So maybe it's time for companies and their infosec advisors to start trusting users with more options for individuating the ways we can lock down our own security on their services. Instead of trying to corral us into whatever must-be-numbers-and-letters half-baked password recipe voodoo they think is best. While their own IT decision makers bump around in the dark prioritizing patches instead of actually applying them. I dunno. It's just a thought.

Conceived in collaboration with the science-fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke, \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey\u201d was way over budget, and Hollywood rumor held that MGM had essentially bet the studio on the project.  The film\u2019s previews were an unmitigated disaster. Its story line encompassed an exceptional temporal sweep, starting with the initial contact between pre-human ape-men and an omnipotent alien civilization and then vaulting forward to later encounters between Homo sapiens and the elusive aliens, represented throughout by the film\u2019s iconic metallic-black monolith. Although featuring visual effects of unprecedented realism and power, Kubrick\u2019s panoramic journey into space and time made few concessions to viewer understanding. The film was essentially a nonverbal experience. Its first words came only a good half-hour in.  Audience walkouts numbered well over 200 at the New York premiere on April 3, 1968, and the next day\u2019s reviews were almost uniformly negative. Writing in the Village Voice, Andrew Sarris called the movie \u201ca thoroughly uninteresting failure and the most damning demonstration yet of Stanley Kubrick\u2019s inability to tell a story coherently and with a consistent point of view.\u201d And yet that afternoon, a long line\u2014comprised predominantly of younger people\u2014extended down Broadway, awaiting the first matinee.  Stung by the initial reactions and under great pressure from MGM, Kubrick soon cut almost 20 minutes from the film. Although \u201c2001\u201d remained willfully opaque and open to interpretation, the trims removed redundancies, and the film spoke more clearly. Critics began to come around. In her review for the Boston Globe, Marjorie Adams, who had seen the shortened version, called it \u201cthe world\u2019s most extraordinary film. Nothing like it has ever been shown in Boston before, or for that matter, anywhere. The film is as exciting as the discovery of a new dimension in life.\u201d  \u2018Stanley and I are laughing all the way to the bank.\u2019  Although incomprehensible by prevailing Hollywood standards, Kubrick\u2019s cryptic, mostly dialogue-free structure fit well with the radical avant-garde artistic innovations of the period, and the movie was an immediate countercultural hit. John Lennon quipped, \u201c\u20182001\u2019? I see it every week,\u201d and David Bowie was inspired to record his hit single \u201cSpace Oddity\u201d just under a year later\u2014a clear allusion to the film. \u201c2001\u201d became a genuine late-\u201960s cultural happening and a bellwether of the decade\u2019s generational divide. With ticket sales brisk from day one, the production ended up the highest-grossing film of 1968. \u201cAs for the dwindling minority who still don\u2019t like it, that\u2019s their problem, not ours,\u201d Clarke wrote. \u201cStanley and I are laughing all the way to the bank.\u201d  Fifty years later, \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey\u201d is widely recognized as ranking among the most influential movies ever made. The most respected poll of such things, conducted every decade by the British Film Institute\u2019s Sight & Sound magazine, asks the world\u2019s leading directors and critics to name the 100 greatest films of all time. The last BFI decadal survey, conducted in 2012, placed it at No. 2 among directors and No. 6 among critics. Not bad for a film that critic Pauline Kael had waited a contemptuous 10 months before dismissing as \u201ctrash masquerading as art\u201d in the pages of Harper\u2019s.  Although the film\u2019s vision of humanity expanding throughout the solar system proved overoptimistic, its portrait of a screen-based, technology-mediated future now seems almost uncannily accurate, and it devastatingly evokes the dehumanization that can result from such communication. As for the cyclopean HAL-9000 supercomputer, often considered the most human character in \u201c2001,\u201d it foreshadowed our anxious contemporary discussion about the potentially dystopian impact of artificial-intelligence technologies.  The film\u2019s extraordinary predictive realism was entirely premeditated, the result of Kubrick and Clarke\u2019s questing, cerebral commitment to scientific and technical accuracy. By all accounts the production was run less like a big-budget Hollywood production than an extended futurological R&D exercise. A broad slate of top aerospace and computer companies were brought on board as consultants and advisers, with such leading innovators as IBM , Bell Labs and Hewlett-Packard all playing important roles.  In the summer of 1965, Kubrick received two detailed Bell Labs reports written by A. Michael Noll (a trailblazer in the development of digital arts and 3-D animation) and information theorist John R. Pierce (who coined the term \u201ctransistor\u201d and headed the team that built the first communications satellite). They recommended that the spacecraft systems in \u201c2001\u201d all feature multiple \u201cfairly large, flat and rectangular\u201d screens, with \u201cno indication of the massive depth of equipment behind them.\u201d Flat screens were, of course, unknown in the \u201960s\u2014at least outside of movie theaters\u2014and they helped to ensure 2001\u2019s futuristic sheen.  The film featured forward-looking flat-screen tablet computers. Photo: Mary Evans/Everett Collection  The role of the film\u2019s sentient supercomputer, originally named Athena, grew throughout the film\u2019s development, under the influence of discussions that Kubrick and Clarke held with MIT cognitive scientist and artificial intelligence pioneer Marvin Minsky and British cryptologist and mathematician I. J. Good. The computer\u2019s physical look resulted from advice provided by IBM\u2019s influential design bureau-think-tank\u2014the Apple Industrial Design Group of its day\u2014then led by industrial designer Eliot Noyes.  In July 1965, Noyes and his team provided drawings of astronauts floating within a kind of \u201cbrain room\u201d\u2014a concept that Kubrick initially rejected but later recognized as having intriguing dramatic possibilities. The astronaut Dave Bowman\u2019s methodical lobotomization of the computer after it\u2014or rather, \u201che\u201d\u2014had killed off the rest of the crew, conducted within the dappled red confines of the film\u2019s remarkable brain-room set, remains one of the most powerfully disturbing scenes ever committed to celluloid.  HAL stood for \u201cHeuristic Algorithmic,\u201d a Minsky suggestion. The computer\u2019s homicidal tendencies emerged only gradually, forcing the production to remove its original IBM nameplate and to substitute another acronym\u2014a kind of subliminal cognate, with \u201cHAL\u201d being displaced from \u201cIBM\u201d by only one letter in each case, something that both Kubrick and Clarke strenuously denied was intentional.  Another fascinating result of the production\u2019s consultation with Big Blue was the film\u2019s forward-looking flat-screen tablet computers, which retained their IBM logos and were called \u201cNewspads.\u201d Constructed long before such technologies were feasible, the movie\u2019s seemingly portable Newspads were actually welded to the tables on which they appeared casually placed, with hidden 16mm film projectors recessed underneath to provide content for their frosted-glass displays.  In the film\u2019s final cut, the Newspads were only used by the astronauts to watch a TV program ostensibly from the BBC and were thus largely indistinguishable from the various other displays embedded in the sets. But the production had received permission from the New York Times to use its logo, and Kubrick\u2019s designers had mocked up a digital front page for the Newspads, complete with multiple story choices to be accessed by touch-screen command. If the page had been used, the movie would almost certainly now be seen as having predicted the internet.  More than four decades later, however, the predictive futurism of \u201c2001\u201d was decisively ratified when Apple released its first iPad in 2010. Samsung issued a similar device a year later, and Apple immediately sued for patent infringement. That August the Korean company filed a response in federal court in San Jose, Calif., asserting that Apple couldn\u2019t possibly have invented the iPad because the device had already been envisioned in \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey.\u201d  Samsung\u2019s unusual defense, which featured both stills and YouTube links from the film, was ultimately ruled inadmissible as evidence, but it confirmed what many fans have long appreciated: the continuing relevance and still-startling prescience of Kubrick\u2019s masterpiece.  \u2014Mr. Benson is the author of \u201cSpace Odyssey: Stanley Kubrick, Arthur Clarke and the Making of a Masterpiece,\u201d which will be published on April 3 by Simon & Schuster.", "stock": "IBM", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-09", "source": "the-wall-street-journal", "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-kubricks-2001-a-space-odyssey-saw-into-the-future-1520609361"}, {"article": "\u201909  \u201914  \u201911  \u201916  \u201908  \u201915  \u201907  A considerable number of French employees say they are ready to leave their jobs for a severance package under the new laws.

France\u2019s economy is finally in recovery, with latest figures showing unemployment at the end of 2017 at 8.9%, its lowest level since early 2009. But Mr. Macron remains under pressure to bring that rate down further, and the country\u2019s powerful unions have their guard up against any evidence that the rules could cost jobs rather than create them.  Foreign businesses that have typically viewed France as a sinkhole for investment are also watching closely. Labor lawyers in Paris are already fielding calls from firms in the U.S. and elsewhere that \u201care interested in the possibility of moving fast in a consensual framework that isn\u2019t traumatic for their teams,\u201d said Claire Toumieux, a partner at law firm Allen & Overy.  IBM, based in Armonk, New York, plans to \u201chire aggressively in key skills areas\u201d in France in parallel to conducting layoffs using the new rules, a company spokeswoman said.  In September, Mr. Macron decreed myriad changes, including capping court-ordered fines for dismissals and giving companies greater powers to negotiate working conditions with employees. One part of the broad package is a measure that absolves companies from using lengthy, complex procedures for voluntary layoffs.

Photo: Michel Stoupak/NurPhoto/ZUMA Press  Previously a firm had to prove it was in financial difficulty before embarking on layoffs, even on a voluntary basis. Publicly traded firms were loath to declare they were struggling. Penalties for missteps in the procedure were high, and a company could ultimately be forced to hire back staff who left.  The new rules allow employers to instead negotiate a rupture conventionnelle collective\u2014a voluntary severance agreement for large numbers of employees\u2014regardless of the company\u2019s health.  \u201cIt\u2019s a complete change in philosophy,\u201d said David Jonin, a partner specializing in employment law at Gide Loyrette Nouel.  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale plans to use the measure to restructure its retail operations. As customers shift to online services, the bank is scrambling to close 300 of its 2,000 retail branches in France and automate 80% of the processes linking front and back offices. The plan, dubbed \u201cTransform to Grow,\u201d will entail 3,450 job cuts from its retail network between 2016 and 2020, the bank said in November.  Many of those cuts were expected to take place through attrition or the redeployment of staff to other units of the bank, but last month the bank disclosed it would also make use of the new rules.  Balancing Act Peugeot is using President Macron's labor measures to slash jobs this year and soften the blow with new recruits. 3,000 Apprentices 2,000 2,000 1,000 New hires  1,300  0  Layoffs  \u20131,000  1,300  Early  retirement  \u20132,000  900  \u20133,000  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale has scheduled talks with unions for later this month. Under the Macron law, any firm that wants to adopt the new scheme needs to win over a majority of its union representatives. In some cases that has emerged as a significant obstacle.  \u201cManagement is going too fast. When you want to get rid of so many jobs, you\u2019ve got to explain why,\u201d said Monique Motsch, a representative of the moderate CFDT union at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.  At French clothing retailer Pimkie, unions already shot down a Jan. 9 proposal to apply the new process, forcing the company to revert to France\u2019s older, more onerous system requiring the firm to show itself as being in financial distress.  Peugeot, in contrast, secured the support of its unions in a matter of days. The car maker threaded the needle by sweetening the layoff offers and combining them with 900 early-retirement offers and a plan to recruit and train higher-skilled employees. That includes 1,300 new positions and 2,000 apprentices.  \u201cPsychologically it\u2019s softer. There\u2019s no obligation to leave, everything is voluntary and it protects workers who want to stay,\u201d said Jean-Francois Kondratiuk, an employee representative who sits on Peugeot\u2019s supervisory board.  Workers who choose to stay at Peugeot are accepting more flexibility. Jean-Louis Thirot, 50, has agreed to train for a new job testing software for car electronics. The research center in the west of Paris where he currently works ordering parts is shutting down this year.  \u201cI\u2019m able to succeed because I can move internally,\u201d said Mr. Thirot, who has worked for Peugeot for more than three decades.  Others say they have recognized that a job at Peugeot is no longer the safe bet it once was. A 40-year-old technician whose father, brother and wife have all worked for the car maker said he thought he had a job for life when he joined the company in 2003. Now that Peugeot has outsourced nearly all of his department\u2019s work, he has decided to take the severance package.  \u201cI\u2019m the last of the Mohicans,\u201d he said.

The East African country, an important player on the continent in the U.S. war on terror, has been mired in political uncertainty after two fraught elections and bursts of violence.  In a news conference, President Uhuru Kenyatta and opposition leader Raila Odinga \u2014who has refused to concede the vote\u2014promised dialogue, and said they would soon roll out a specific path to reconciliation.  \u201cWe shall bring a process of bringing of our people together, and find out what really divides our nation,\u201d Mr. Kenyatta said. \u201cWe must bring together all our people where no single person is left behind.\u201d  Mr. Tillerson\u2019s arrival, after stops in Ethiopia and Djibouti, reflects Kenya\u2019s role as a top ally in combating al-Shabaab, the al Qaeda affiliate in Somalia. Nairobi is also home to regional headquarters to some major U.S. corporations like IBM , Google and Coca-Cola .  Mr. Tillerson congratulated the two men in a news conference in Nairobi later Friday, and he played down the U.S. role in the sudden reconciliation.  \u201cThe U.S. obviously has been very supportive of Kenya\u2019s journey moving forward after what\u2019s been a difficult election period,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was very important action on their part to show that they are ready to work on behalf of all Kenyans \u2026 all the credit goes to the two leaders this morning.\u201d  Ahead of the visit, a senior State Department official said the U.S. had extensively engaged with Mr. Odinga to bring about reconciliation.  \u201cWhat we said to him ... is that you have a really tremendous opportunity for historic times to really push forward political and economic reforms,\u201d said acting assistant Secretary of State for Africa Donald Yamamoto.  The U.S. diplomatic mission has been involved in attempting mediation as the political crisis deepened.  In the past few months, anti-U.S. sentiment has been on the rise. Opposition supporters saw U.S. recognition of Mr. Kenyatta as a partisan move, and protesters demonstrated outside the U.S. embassy earlier this year over what they called U.S. interference.  Unrest following the two elections led to dozens of fatalities and has reopened the ethnic rifts that in 2007 left more than 1,000 people dead in postelection violence.  Mr. Odinga, who represents a large swath of the population who feel cut off from the country\u2019s elite, has accused Mr. Kenyatta of being a dictator and declared himself the \u201cpeople\u2019s president.\u201d  On Friday he shook Mr. Kenyatta\u2019s hand and promised to \u201cend these differences.\u201d  \u201cWe need to save our children from ourselves,\u201d Mr. Odinga said.  The surprise moves comes amid an escalation of a standoff that started last year ahead of August presidential elections.  In a first for Africa, the outcome of those elections was annulled by the country\u2019s Supreme Court, which ruled they had been marred by irregularities. Mr. Odinga boycotted new elections in October. Only one in three Kenyans took part, and Mr. Kenyatta was re-elected to another 5-year term with 98% of the vote.  Kenya\u2019s economy, a pole for international investment where Chinese-built mega infrastructure like a $4-billion dollar railway runs alongside an equally ambitious highway being built by U.S. construction giant Bechtel, felt the pain of the prolonged crisis.  Its growth rate, previously among the continent\u2019s highest at above 6%, and multiple times the world average, slowed down to 4.8% in 2017, according to the International Monetary Fund.  The Kenyan shilling inched higher against the dollar soon after the joint statement by the two leaders.

His briefings of Apple breakthroughs over the years were legendary, and featured huge visuals behind him as he paced the stage. He was not just an innovator but also a master communicator. When I had to give addresses back in my military days, I would dive into Carmine Gallo\u2019s \u201cThe Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs\u201d for inspiration.  Watching Russian President Vladimir Putin roll out a similar display of fearsome new weapons at his state of the federation speech the other day had the distinct feeling of watching a Steve Jobs-style brief put together by \"Q,\" the gadget-loving quartermaster from MI6, in a twisted James Bond movie. But this bag of tricks is neither a new iPhone nor an Aston Martin with machine guns, or even an exploding pen. Putin was talking about nuclear weapons moving toward the U.S. on a variety of new platforms. How seriously should we take this?  Let\u2019s put aside that the video's special effects seemed straight from a 1990s video game, and start with the purported weapons themselves. In each case, U.S. intelligence has been tracking the development of these systems over the past decade. There is a nuclear-tipped and nuclear-powered torpedo; a new generation intercontinental ballistic missile with longer ranges; a nuclear-powered cruise missile that could theoretically fly more or less forever and attack the U.S. from any location; an air-launched high-speed cruise missile; and a hypersonic glide missile capable of flying 20 times the speed of sound. He also mentioned new laser systems to deploy against U.S. weapons. He described several of the weapons as \u201cinvincible.\u201d  His motivation in hyping these systems is threefold. First, in the \u201call politics is local\u201d category, he has an election coming up on March 18. While he is predictably and comfortably in the lead in all the polls (fairly easy to do when your opponents are assassinated or jailed and you have complete media control), he still wants to play to his base, as the saying goes. Russians, like people everywhere, enjoy nothing so much as a big spectacle on a huge stage. Add to that a good bashing of Russia\u2019s enemy No. 1, and you have a sure winner.  Second, Putin is communicating with his circle of dictatorial allies and partners around the world. His message to Bashar al-Assad in Syria, Kim Jung Un in North Korea, and the ayatollahs in Iran (can you spell \u201caxis of evil\u201d?) is one of reassurance that someone can stand up to the U.S. in terms of global deterrence and high-end military technology. The demonstration is also a good way to enhance the sales of Russian weapons systems globally -- its producers are currently the second-largest supplier of weapons in the world and would love to surpass the U.S. Indeed, Russia exports as much as Germany, France and the U.K. combined, and triple what China sells globally.  Finally, Putin is sending a very direct signal to Washington. He hates U.S. and Western interference with Russia at any level, from the sanctions over the invasion of Ukraine and annexation of Crimea to the Olympic punishments meted out after the massive doping scandal. The intent here is simple and brutal: We are a nuclear power and can destroy your nation. The fact that the U.S. can do the same to Russia is not lost on Putin, but he will never miss a chance to remind the U.S. that Russia has an equally lethal nuclear arsenal.  In terms of serious military capability, last week's demonstration was a mixed bag. Nothing he displayed represented either a shock to the U.S. intelligence community or a significant change in the existing balance of nuclear and conventional power. Several of the systems have not been demonstrated publically, nor put into serious production. The most worrisome over time is probably the nuclear torpedo, but the idea of a Russian first-strike remains extremely remote. And it is hard to envision a scenario in which the U.S. decides to strike Russia. The odds are extremely high that we will continue along with the same deterrent regime that has kept the nuclear peace since the end of World War II: mutual assured destruction.  In terms of policy issues, Putin's display of braggadocio underscores several important points. First is that stepping up the U.S. conventional force posture in Europe is going to be critical to deterring Russia from using these kinds of weapons to threaten the Europeans. For a start, this means having a full four U.S. brigade combat teams in place and permanently stationed in Europe. We also must continue to push NATO allies to up their game in terms of forces that are combat-ready.  It also emphasizes the importance of avoiding an escalation on both sides, in terms of producing and deploying low-yield nuclear weapons, which could very quickly intensify in a tense scenario and cause Russia to use one of these strategic weapons -- what analysts refer to as the \"escalate to de-escalate\" doctrine. Finally, it will require the Pentagon to develop comparable systems to maintain deterrence, particularly hyper-sonic nuclear-tipped cruise missiles, where Russian progress is outstripping out own.  Another striking aspect of Putin's presentation was his hyper-vitriolic tone, even compared to his previous stridency on such occasions. Given that he will in all likelihood remain Russia's leader for life, we should pay significant attention to the uber-aggressive style of the display. It is hard to imagine any U.S. president in modern history, including even the current incumbent, depicting nuclear attacks on Russia on a large-screen display. It screams of a man desperate for respect, and such men can be very dangerous over time -- especially if they hold a relatively weak overall hand of cards.  And Putin does: Russia has profound demographic problems (also alluded to in Putin\u2019s speech); serious environmental challenges; a struggling economy highly concentrated on hydrocarbons; and few real allies in the world. In many ways, we should worry more about Russian weakness than Russian strength.  For the U.S., the best move with Russia remains simple and transactional: confront where we must (Ukraine, Syria, cyber-intrusions); but cooperate where we can. The latter includes counter-narcotics, counter-piracy, counterterrorism, Afghanistan, the Arctic and other mutual concerns. And there are reasonable \u201cTrack 2\u201d diplomatic options for the nations, such as exchanges between academic institutions, think tanks, laboratories and commercial entities.  We are not quite yet in a new Cold War, but it isn\u2019t hard to see one shimmering in the near distance. Most worrisome of all, U.S. and Russian military forces are in combat in close proximity in Syria, and we are watching our military jets and warships maneuvering at close quarters in the Black and Baltic Seas. We are one significant tactical mistake away from stumbling into real danger. Leaders on both sides need to take a deep breath and encourage their subordinates to do the same.

The Spectre and Meltdown attacks were a public relations nightmare for Intel. Now they've become a legal headache as well.  The chip making giant, its board members, and executives face 35 lawsuits related to the attacks, the company disclosed in its annual report on Friday. Because the suits are in their early stages, Intel said it couldn't determine how much they could potentially cost it.  \"We dispute the claims ... and intend to defend the lawsuits vigorously,\" the company said in its annual report.  A company representative declined to comment on the lawsuits.  Security researchers disclosed the Spectre and Meltdown attacks last month. Taking advantage of a particular feature found in nearly all computer processors, the attacks could allow a malicious actor to view secret data stored on PCs, tablets, and smartphones, including users' passwords. In recent weeks, chip makers, device manufacturers, and operating system vendors have been scrambling to patch their devices and software to protect them from the vulnerabilities.  The attacks were actually discovered in June, and Intel was made aware of them soon thereafter. The vulnerability the attacks exploit has been present in nearly all Intel chips made over the last 20 years. And, unlike chips made by other manufacturers, Intel's processors are vulnerable to both Spectre and Meltdown.  Intel's handling of Spectre and Meltdown has drawn criticism \u2014 and now lawsuits  Intel's handling of the situation has raised eyebrows not just because it waited more than six months to disclose the attacks to the public despite the fact that its chips were particularly at risk of them, but also because of a massive stock sale made by company CEO Brian Krzanich after the company found out about the attacks. In sale \u2014 through which Krzanich saw a $24 million windfall \u2014 the CEO sold off all of the shares of Intel he was allowed to sell under his contract.  Intel has noted that the sale, which Krzanich made in November, was done as part of a planned stock divestiture. But Krzanich only put that plan in place a month earlier, which was more than four months after Intel became aware of the attacks.  Thirty of the lawsuits filed against Intel are seeking class action status and were filed by customers who claim they were harmed by the attacks or by the company's failure to disclose them, according to the annual report. Two of the suits, also seeking class action status, were filed on behalf of shareholders who charge that the disclosure of the attacks shows that statements Intel made about its products or business were false or misleading.  Additionally, another three Intel investors have filed shareholder derivative suits in California state court, according to the annual report. Those suits charge that Intel's executives or directors failed in their duties to shareholders by delaying disclosure of the breach or not doing anything about insider trading at the company.  The Intel representative declined to say whether the company's board has investigated Krzanich's stock trade.", "stock": "INTC", "label": 1, "date": "2018-02-16", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/35-lawsuits-have-been-filed-against-intel-over-spectre-and-meltdown-2018-2"}, {"article": "Reuters/Albert Gea  Two major flaws in how modern computers process information has sent the tech world scrambling for a fix.  Amid the scramble, Intel, the company most affected by the flaws, has seen its stock price slump.  But, as the company prepares to report earnings soon, one analyst thinks the company will be fine in the near term.  Watch Intel's stock price move in real time here.    Spectre and Meltdown, arguably the two biggest flaws ever found in modern computers, might not have a big impact on the near-term earnings of Intel, the company hit the hardest by the flaws.  At least, that's the thinking of John Pitzer, an analyst at Credit Suisse.  \"While our calendar first quarter estimates embed NO negative impact to revenue from the Meltdown/Spectre security issues \u2013 near term we would highlight that the uncertainty created could cause at least some calendar first quarter server/client purchases to be deferred as IT managers look for more clarity,\" Pitzer said in a note to clients.  Spectre and Meltdown are flaws in a technique modern CPUs use to speed up computing. There are three total variations of the two flaws, and Intel is the only company whose chips have been reported to be affected by all three. The company has seen its share price decline about 8.73% so far this year after the flaws were disclosed publicly.  Pizter previously released a report the day after the flaws were disclosed that claimed everyone was making \"mountains from molehills\" regarding the flaws. A lot of new information about the flaws has surfaced since then, but Pizter is holding his ground, saying Intel's near-term revenue largely won't be affected.  There have been confusing and conflicting reports around the flaws since their public disclosure, however. AMD, which is Intel's main rival in the space, initially said its hardware would not be affected by the flaws, and later reversed its stance. Nvidia, which makes GPUs, created confusion when it issued Spectre and Meltdown patches for its products which were thought to be impervious to the flaws. Nvidia later clarified that its patches were only precautionary, and its products are not affected.  Patches to fix CPUs affected by the flaws were initially thought to slow down certain programs by as much as 30%, and an exact impact on performance has yet to be determined. Pitzer said IT managers and big data centers could delay planned purchases of Intel chips until more clarity is found, and the long-term effects of the flaws for chipmakers won't be evident for some time.  If certain companies' chips are found to be faster than others after all the final Spectre and Meltdown patches have been issued, there could be a sector-wide shift to the faster chips, Pitzer said.  Pizter has a \"neutral\" rating on Intel, but said it's mostly because he thinks the company is too expensive right now, not because of the potential risks associated with Spectre and Meltdown.  Intel reports fourth quarter earnings January 25, and Pitzer thinks the results will fall in line with Wall Street's expectations. Pizter is expecting earnings per share of $0.86 on revenue of $16.3 billion.

Essentially this means that instead of sending data to the cloud for processing, it needs to be done right on the device itself because even a little bit of latency is too much.  Intel announced a new chip today, called the Intel Xeon D-2100 processor, to help customers who want to move computing to the edge. It\u2019s part of an effort by the chip giant to stay ahead of emerging technology trends like edge computing and the Internet of Things.  Computing at the edge has some unique space and power requirements that Intel has tried to address with this announcement. For starters, it provides a stand-alone system on a chip (SoC). This means everything you need is built into the chip including compute, networking and storage. It\u2019s also low power, which might be necessary to run an edge computing device without the benefit of a data center power structure.  In a blog post announcing the new chip, Jennifer Huffstetler, vice president and general manager of data center product management in the Data Center Group at Intel, pointed out the growing need for this type of architecture. \u201cBy expanding the capabilities of the data center outward to the network edge, solution providers can process more data closer to endpoint devices, reducing application latency and opening up a whole new world of potential services and experience,\u201d Huffstetler wrote.  She added that the SoC gives customers an \u201cintegrated, hardware-enhanced network, security and acceleration capabilities in a single package.\u201d The chip achieves all of this by packing a lot into a small package including up to 18 \u2018Skylake-server\u2019 generation Intel Xeon processor cores integrated with up to 100 Gbps of built-in cryptography, decryption and encryption acceleration. Intel calls this \u2018QuickAssist Technology.\u2019  The company sees this being particularly useful for new 5G technologies being developed for smartphones like augmented and virtual reality applications and autonomous driving. They also see it being useful for communications network use cases like virtual private networks and software-defined wide area networks and also certain cloud workloads that require processing close to the edge such as content delivery networks.  Intel has already built a partner network for the new chip with a variety of companies including Dell EMC, Ericsson, NEC, NetApp and Palo Alto Networks.  And if you\u2019re concerned about the impact of the Spectre and Meltdown exploits, Intel reports that it has built in the latest patches into the new chip.

Photo  The Trump administration says it wants to level the playing field, dishing out to Chinese companies the kind of treatment that American ones have been receiving in China for some time.  \u201cChina\u2019s abilities and ambitions have shifted much further up the value-added chain, to tech that represents our crown jewels economically and that is relevant for national security,\u201d said Scott Kennedy, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \u201cSo there\u2019s no way to kick this can down the road anymore.\u201d  Still, as much as American companies complain about how they are treated in China, it could get even worse if Beijing amplifies its retaliation beyond the tariffs, announced Friday, on $3 billion worth of goods.  China could require that foreign tech companies undergo costly additional tests for new products, or simply make it more difficult to operate in the country. Apple, whose iPhones remain coveted among well-off Chinese, made nearly $18 billion in the country in the last quarter of 2017. Qualcomm, the San Diego microchip maker, has earned half its revenue in China in recent years.  It could also devise new regulatory hoops for foreign companies to jump through. China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce has not yet approved Qualcomm\u2019s proposed, $44 billion purchase of NXP Semiconductors, a Dutch chip maker. The deal, more than a year in the making, needs a signoff from Chinese antitrust authorities because the two companies count a large number of electronics makers in China as customers.  Both countries\u2019 efforts to kneecap each other\u2019s tech champions are as much about national security as economic might. Likewise with the race to dominate frontier fields such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing and next-generation wireless internet. Mr. Trump recently blocked a hostile bid by Broadcom to buy Qualcomm. He did so not because the bidder was Chinese \u2014 Broadcom is headquartered in Singapore \u2014 but because the administration said the deal would weaken Qualcomm, leaving Huawei with a stronger hand to shape 5G, or fifth-generation mobile technology.

The Soviet Union was a tech rival in defense, though a laggard in the commercial sphere.

For most of the past decade, Beijing has blocked many American internet services, including Facebook\u2019s and Google\u2019s, to control the flow of information and head off social media-fueled movements such as the Arab Spring.  Another great paroxysm of worry came in 2013, when Edward J. Snowden leaked documents showing ties between American technology providers and the National Security Agency\u2019s vast surveillance program.  For China, \u201cone of the major takeaways was, \u2018We are overly reliant on American technology over which we have very little control,\u2019\u201d said Rogier Creemers, a scholar of Chinese tech policy at Leiden University in the Netherlands.  A Communist Party-linked newsmagazine singled out the American companies that it said had penetrated most deeply into China\u2019s information infrastructure. The \u201cEight Guardian Warriors,\u201d as they were called \u2014 Apple, Cisco, Google, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Oracle and Qualcomm \u2014 had been able to \u201cdrive right into China,\u201d the article said, whereas Huawei and another Chinese equipment maker, ZTE, had been kept out of the United States.  Beijing swung into action. It banned government offices from installing the most recent version of Microsoft Windows, and antitrust investigators raided Microsoft\u2019s offices. Cisco, Apple and Intel products were removed from state lists that officials use as guides when buying equipment. Qualcomm got slapped with a $975 million fine for anticompetitive behavior.  The political pressure sent American companies scrambling to link up with Chinese partners, leading to joint ventures of the sort that the Trump administration, and some in the American business community, have decried as unfair.

But most observers believe that it is only a matter of time before Chinese factories catch up to those at industry leaders in the United States, South Korea and Taiwan.  \u201cThey are very conscious that they still have a long way to go,\u201d said Dieter Ernst, a senior fellow at the East-West Center, a research and educational organization based in Honolulu. \u201cBut they also know that in semiconductors, they are by far the most important market for American companies.\u201d  One stumbling block for China: Attempts to scoop up foreign chip makers mostly have not worked out. State-owned Tsinghua Unigroup tried to buy Micron Technology, a memory chip maker based in Idaho, for $23 billion in 2015, but regulatory worries scuttled the deal.  The Trump administration last year blocked a China-backed investor from buying Lattice Semiconductor, an Oregon-based manufacturer. And regulatory concerns scotched a Chinese investment group\u2019s plan to buy Xcerra, even though the Massachusetts-based company makes chip-testing equipment and not chips themselves.  In Washington, concern about the emerging rivalry with China has been reflected in a number of recent reports, from the likes of the Pentagon and the Department of Energy, that warn about the country\u2019s growing tech capabilities. Still, shorter-term considerations could mean that Washington would back down before Beijing in an all-out trade war.  \u201cIf the markets take a nose-dive as we move closer to the midterm elections,\u201d Mr. Kennedy of the Center for Strategic and International Studies said, \u201cthat would put some pressure on Trump to look for face-saving solutions, even if final problems haven\u2019t been addressed.\u201d", "stock": "INTC", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-23", "source": "the-new-york-times", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/23/technology/trump-china-tariffs-tech-cold-war.html"}, {"article": "When we first heard of Intel\u2019s H-series Coffee Lake processors for laptops, we had a hunch it would include some of company\u2019s first hexa-core CPUs. But, we never expected Core i9 to make the jump to laptops .  On desktops, high-end processors, like the Intel Core i9-7980XE , have brought the highest-core counts we\u2019ve seen on consumer chips and the greatest multi-core performance we\u2019ve tested.  In similar fashion, the top-of-the-line chip boasts a six-core and 12-thread arrangement for the first time on a mobile part, with the addition of higher clock speeds up to 4.8GHz, thanks to its fully unlocked status. Intel claims that its Core i9-8950HK is the best gaming and content-creation laptop processor it has ever built. Even amongst its 8th generation H-series brethren, this top-end part is claimed to deliver at least 10% more performance than the second-most powerful Intel Core i7-8850H.  Of course, there\u2019s always a greater story behind any legendary leap forward such as this, and Fredrik Hamberger, general manager of premium and gaming notebooks at Intel, is excited to tell all.  \u201cWe saw the demand from our highest-end enthusiasts for more performance,\u201d Hamberger says, explaining the origins of the first mobile Core i9 processor. \u201cThey wanted something more, different and higher-end than just what we were scaling with our entire category.\u201d  \u201cSo, we looked at that and we had an opportunity to squeeze a little more out of our process and by doing some unique things, like Thermal Velocity Boost.\u201d  Thermal Velocity Boost will require the best cooled notebooks  Going into overdrive  Just what is Thermal Velocity Boost (TVB) anyway? It\u2019s basically a feature that allows Intel\u2019s top-end processor to achieve an additional 200MHz of additional frequency on top its standard 4.6GHz Turbo Boost.  \u201cBy taking advantage of the fact that, at lower temperatures, you can actually achieve higher frequencies,\u201d Hamberger explains, \u201cwe\u2019ve done some tweaking to our process and microcode to enable an additional boost in frequency when the processor temperature allows. \u201c  Like most of Intel\u2019s Turbo Boost technology, Thermal Velocity Boost turns on automatically applies the 200 extra megahertz of additional frequency as long as a workload \u2013 such as a video encode or rendering 3D models \u2013 requires it and the chip is operating at 50-degrees Celsius or lower.  As Hamberger explains it, TVB is centered around burst workloads rather holding a sustained overclock for tasks such as gaming.  \u201cAs the part heats up, you might drop down to only 100MHz of additional frequency and when it reaches something above 70- or 80-degrees Celsius you might not get that any additional speed,\u201d Hamberger says.  Still, you can expect the chip to operate at its guaranteed turbo boost frequency of 4.6GHz up to 100-degrees Celsius. Any hotter than that, and you\u2019ll most likely have other problems on your hands.  Bringing desktop power to laptops  Following our talks with Intel, it is abundantly clear that the ultimate goal of its new Intel Core i9 chip is to bring the power of desktops to the laptop. The concept isn\u2019t exactly new to the mobile space: over the years, we\u2019ve seen plenty of manufacturers implement desktop processors into gaming laptops , such as the Origin EON15-X .  Intel, being the actual maker of the processors, wasn\u2019t about to just ramshackle a desktop-level part into a notebook. Rather, it engineered a chip completely designed for mobile with a thermal design and power delivery that notebooks could support.  \u201cWe saw the wish for power and performance and that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to deliver, giving them as much as we can in a mobile-friendly form factor,\u201d Hamberger tells us. \u201cYou get that better form factor, battery life and tuning that you wouldn\u2019t get with a socketed part in a notebook chassis.\u201d  \u201cIf you look at what we did with our highest-end performing SKU. The Core i9 is on par with last year\u2019s desktop chip.  The thinnest Intel Core i9-powered laptop  For the most part, Hamberger sees musclebook \u2013 a new phrase Intel has coined for thicker workstations and gaming notebooks \u2013 users being able to take the full advantage of Core i9\u2019s overclocking capabilities as they offer a higher level of cooling, allowing for TVB to kick in more often. That said, there will also be thinner laptops capable of supporting Intel\u2019s highest-end chip, such as the Dell XPS 15 .  \u201cIt\u2019s also going to show up in the sub 20mm category that has thinness and greater battery life than six hours,\u201d he says.  If you look at the history of silicon in computers, there\u2019s always been a trickle-down effect, especially in Intel\u2019s case. Intel Core i9, and the greater Core X series, brought server capability into a desktop format with megatasking.  Now, Intel Core i9 brings the performance of a desktop and server-borne megatasking to notebooks, all within the company\u2019s first hexa-core processors for laptops.

The purchase of Regency Outdoor Advertising, if successful, would be the largest yet for the fast-growing Silicon Valley streaming video company, which has a studio in Hollywood and is now one of the world\u2019s biggest film and TV producers.  Netflix\u2019s motivation was not immediately clear, but it could save money over time with the deal, according to industry analysts, as it ramps up spending on marketing for its original shows and movies to $2 billion this year. Netflix used Regency Outdoor billboards to promote its \u201cStranger Things\u201d and \u201cThe Crown\u201d drama series.  A billboard ad on Los Angeles\u2019s Sunset Strip can cost $140,000 per month, said Barry Lowenthal, president of The Media Kitchen, a New York-based media buyer.  \u201cThis is a smart move for Netflix because it is a very important viewing market,\u201d Lowenthal said. \u201cLos Angeles matters to the people in the industry.\u201d  Tech firms Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Hulu and Facebook Inc (FB.O) and traditional media companies such as Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) are all vying with Netflix to win subscribers.

Nope, not by a long chalk\u2026  The European Commission is holding a press conference later today to trumpet progress made on ending \u201cunjustified geoblocking\u201d, as it tells it, with the stated aim of greasing the wheels of pan-EU ecommerce in time for Christmas.  Which, from a consumer point of view, sounds great. Unfortunately it\u2019s not quite as great as it sounds. Especially if you were imagining it would apply to popular digital media streaming services like Spotify and Netflix . Nope, sorry.  Geoblocks for digital media are not being vanquished in this round of EU Digital Single Market regulation chess.  What is being agreed by EU lawmakers is an end to geoblocks for the sale of goods and services \u2014 just not if the electronic services in question happen to be stuff like, er, streaming music, TV, video and so on\u2026  Don\u2019t be fooled if a speaker says that we abolished #geoblocking, though. We didn\u2019t. Only for buying goods & services, but not for digital media like videos, games, ebooks. Progress is slow. https://t.co/T9LnFEul1y \u2014 Julia Reda (@Senficon) February 5, 2018  A crumb of comfort on that front is last year agreement was reached among EU institutions on new rules around the portability of digital content for travelers \u2014 meaning that from this year EU citizens traveling across the 28 Member State bloc can now access the online media services which they have already subscribed to when they are on holiday in another EU country.  But if you want to actually subscribe to \u2014 and continuously consume \u2014 those sorts of audio-visual digital services across EU borders, well, you\u2019re going to be out of luck. Copyright being the major blocker here.  What does this mean in practice? Well, EU geoblocks are certainly alive and well if you try to sign up to \u2014 for example \u2014 Netflix from a different Member State to the EU country where you live (or where your bank cards were issued).  Or even if you attempt to buy a Spotify gift card for a person who lives in a different EU country to the country you do.  The digital service providers will simply deny these kind of transactions \u2014 and the notion of an EU \u2018digital single market\u2019 will be shown up as rather more aspiration than actual at this point. Nor is that situation going to change this year.  The Commission does know this \u2014 because it\u2019s at least making an attempt to address the regulatory dissonance. In September 2016 it proposed additional EU legislation aimed at facilitating the provision of cross-border audiovisual services.  But an EC spokeswoman confirmed to us that those provisions remain under negotiation.  And, as MEP Julia Reda tweeted yesterday, progress is slow. The progress-blocking culprit? Take a bow Hollywood et al\u2026  That\u2019s why we will still vote in favour. It\u2019s important to note though that also the Parliament position would have left copyright and licensing regimes completely intact. It\u2019s just excluded because nobody wants to fight the powerful entertainment industry. \u2014 Julia Reda (@Senficon) February 5, 2018  In a 2016 impact assessment document attached to the Commission\u2019s proposal \u2014 and specifically discussing the licensing of video on demand rights \u2014 the EC wrote that its preferred option \u201cincludes a European stakeholders\u2019 dialogue and a negotiation mechanism that would facilitate the conclusion of licences for the online exploitation of audiovisual works by removing contractual blockages\u201d.  Which is a long-winded way of saying they need to get the entertainment industry to agree to cross-border licensing. So, frankly speaking, I wouldn\u2019t hold your breath for the arrival of that truly seamless digital single market dream.  The EC\u2019s VP for the # DigitalSingleMarket recognized the problem in comments made at a plenary meeting yesterday \u2014 saying it intends to pay \u201cparticular attention\u201d to the \u201cnon-audio visual copyright protected services like software, games, e-books and music\u201d, and admitting the current regulation only partially covers this sort of digital content.  His comments also confirm that services like Netflix represent the hardest digital content cross-border portability problem to fix. (Even \u2014 and here\u2019s the consumer kicker \u2014 as they\u2019re likely to be the kind of services EU citizens really do want \u2018seamless\u2019 access to\u2026 )  What about #geoblocking of content protected by #copyright?  \u27a1\ufe0fWe'll review the scope of #geoblocking rules 2 years after entry into force  \u27a1\ufe0fI urge MEPs & Member States to agree on #satcab rules on cross-border access to audiovisual content online & keep level of ambition pic.twitter.com/AwMSi6cPxY \u2014 Andrus Ansip (@Ansip_EU) February 6, 2018  So, for the circa 20 million EU citizens the EC says were born in a different EU Member State from the one where they live now, there will be around three years\u2019 wait before the Commission is even going to take a closer look at the kind of geoblocks they\u2019re still being saddled with.  And the Christmas 2018 consolation prize of a partial end to geoblocks is just that: A piecemeal offer that doesn\u2019t change much.  Instead of seamless cross-border access to popular streaming media services this year, EU citizens might be able to shop online for physical goods from another EU Member State which they then have to go and pick up themselves (or arrange their own shipping).  They may also be able to purchase an electronic service like web hosting from another Member State without having to pay any additional fees (though not necessarily obtaining the service at the same price).  And they could perhaps be able to purchase a service provided in a specific physical location without being redirected to a local website to do so.  All thanks to the Commission\u2019s \u2018unjustified geoblocks\u2019 regulation. (\u2018Might\u2019, \u2018may\u2019 and \u2018could\u2019 because the EC notes the regulation does not impose an obligation on companies to sell. Nor does it harmonise prices, as noted above.)  The point of this piecemeal regulation, says the EC, is to address discrimination in access to goods and services \u201cin cases where it cannot be objectively justified (e.g. by VAT obligations or different legal requirements)\u201d.  It\u2019s just a shame it\u2019s the Commission has failed to embrace a meaningful reform of digital copyright rules across the bloc.

But it is a kind of alternative TV dimension, overlaying and replicating the known world of traditional television, that tries to acquire one of everything that exists in the universe of TV.  Initially, the company did this through literal acquisition: buying streaming rights to hit TV series. Then it did it through imitation: reviving Fox\u2019s \u201cArrested Development\u201d and creating originals, like \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d in the mold of premium cable. Now it\u2019s imitating through acquisition, spiriting away the likes of Mr. Murphy and Ms. Rhimes to its well-remunerated plane.  The history of TV is one of upstarts and competitors, and my first instinct was to liken Netflix to something like cable, which rose as a serious competitor to broadcast TV in the 1980s.  But there\u2019s an important difference between cable channels and Netflix (besides whom you write your check to). Cable channels have brands. That was what made them different from broadcast networks, which tried to be, and had to be, everything. Cable channels had specialties and sensibilities: CNN was news; ESPN was sports; HBO was adult sophistication (give or take an \u201cEntourage\u201d).  Photo  A cable brand might evolve \u2014 Bravo went from an arts channel to the \u201cReal Housewives\u201d channel \u2014 but the idea was to offer a specific aesthetic to a specific audience.  Netflix doesn\u2019t have that; in fact, it is specifically anti-that. Its brand is \u201cstuff that you like to watch on TV.\u201d It developed a vast library of reruns, and with that, a proprietary trove of data on who likes to watch what and how much. Then it made more of that, or bought it. If you liked \u201c30 Rock,\u201d here\u2019s \u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.\u201d If you liked \u201cDamages,\u201d here\u2019s \u201cBloodline.\u201d  Look at just the past few months of Netflix programming. There\u2019s \u201cThe Crown,\u201d a BBC-style historical drama. \u201cWormwood,\u201d an Errol Morris docudrama. \u201cOne Day at a Time,\u201d a 21st-century reboot of a 1970s network TV multicamera sitcom. \u201cDirty Money,\u201d a \u201cFrontline\u201d-esque documentary anthology. \u201cShe\u2019s Gotta Have It,\u201d a risqu\u00e9 romantic comedy. \u201cMy Next Guest Needs No Introduction,\u201d a David Letterman interview series. Oh, and why not \u2014 let\u2019s throw in a \u201cCloverfield\u201d sequel and a Will Smith movie.

The obvious analogy, then, is that Netflix isn\u2019t cable at all; it\u2019s a broadcaster, pitching a big tent.  But, as I\u2019ve written before, there\u2019s one very important difference. Broadcasters, whose advertising model required millions of eyeballs on every individual show, had to make sure that everything they aired appealed to a broad range of people.  That business imperative had aesthetic results: It gave us family sitcoms and comfort-food cop dramas. It\u2019s less true today, in the era of smaller audiences \u2014 but it\u2019s still much more true of NBC than, say, of IFC.

It\u2019s selling a platform to everyone, but by providing products for very specific tastes.  Netflix assumes a future in which we\u2019re watching our faves on our own screens, rather than gathering around an electronic fireplace \u2014 and as long as the monthly payment clears, it\u2019s all the same to the company. It\u2019s less a big tent than a Dothraki tent city, to borrow a metaphor from \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d  What does this mean for Ryan Murphy and Shonda Rhimes? Maybe not much at all. They were both powerful producers with a lot of freedom who will now have a lot of freedom and more money.  Photo  Mr. Murphy was, in a way, the Netflix-iest of producers to begin with: He\u2019d made everything from a broadcast network sitcom (\u201cThe New Normal\u201d) to an action show (\u201c9-1-1\u201d) to a marquee cable drama (\u201cFeud\u201d) to an HBO film (\u201cThe Normal Heart\u201d). He may be able to branch out even more, but he was hardly fettered.  What Ms. Rhimes does at Netflix will be interesting. She\u2019s the consummate network TV producer, having essentially defined the current voice of ABC with \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d and \u201cScandal.\u201d  She might do something very different with the license of streaming \u2014 but if she doesn\u2019t, that will fit in all the same at Netflix, which resurrected the broadcast favorite \u201cGilmore Girls\u201d with much the same tone, give or take a few curse words. One curious thing about Netflix is that every sensibility \u2014 niche and mass, G-rated and NSFW \u2014 exists on the same platform and the same plane.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Is all the deal-making worth it? Whether Netflix is emptying its deep pockets wisely by making itself into a Hall of Fame for established stars (see also Dave Chappelle) isn\u2019t my concern as a TV critic.  What I do care about is whether Netflix can nurture original, distinctive art, especially if it continues growing into a huge, all-encompassing alterna-TV.  And I worry whether it can do that when derivation is the business strategy itself: selling people new versions of things they already like. It\u2019s fine that Netflix can toss around enough money to reactivate David Letterman. But does it have the kind of culture that could discover a new David Letterman?  In its short life as an original programmer. Netflix has made a few series I\u2019d consider legitimately great. But most of them have involved making deals with creators with limited track records (\u201cBoJack Horseman,\u201d \u201cAmerican Vandal\u201d) or talented artists relatively new to creating series (\u201cMaster of None,\u201d \u201cLady Dynamite\u201d). (As I\u2019ve also written before, these shows tend to be comedies, which may translate more directly and easily to the streaming format.)  A more familiar experience on Netflix is the good-enough version of a drama you\u2019ve seen elsewhere. \u201cGodless,\u201d say, was a perfectly decent dark western, but no \u201cDeadwood.\u201d \u201cStranger Things\u201d is a joy, but it\u2019s a pastiche by design: It\u2019s the Netflix ethos in story form, reproducing and remixing memories in ways that tickle just the right nostalgia pleasure centers.  It may be that Netflix\u2019s approach means more competence and fewer out-and-out stinkers. And I have no reason to believe that Mr. Murphy and Ms. Rhimes will become any less creative because Netflix backed up a money truck.  But if Netflix is truly becoming a parallel TV universe, I hope its algorithm finds room for the experimental and untried.

One of the most notable things the Netflix chief mentioned is that his streaming service doesn't have any plans whatsoever to do live TV, even if rivals like Hulu and Amazon's Prime Video are investing heavily in that space. \"To follow a competitor, never, never, never,\" he said. \"We have so much we want to do in our area, so we're not trying to copy others, whether that's linear cable, there's lots of things we don't do. We don't do [live] news, we don't do [live] sports. But what we do do, we try to do really well.\"  He said that while \"all of these media companies\" are trying to get into video, specifically newcomers such as Facebook, Netflix has been competing with seasons rivals like Amazon for a decade and he's happy with the success of his company thus far. Earlier this year, during its Q4 2017 earnings report, Netflix announced that it added 8.3 million new customers that quarter, its largest single-quarter growth ever. Those numbers certainly seem to bolster Hasting's confidence. He said that, while it's a very competitive market at the moment -- and it's only going to get tougher with others like Facebook and YouTube joining the fray -- he believes that if Netflix continues to produce great series and content, it has nothing to worry about.  \"If we do our own Prime service, we'll never succeed,\" he said, referring to the idea that Netflix could offer something beyond its on-demand content. He added that what hurts Netflix's competitors is that \"their strategy is to win by being broad, you know, a little bit of everything.\" Hastings said it's also key to ensure customers that they're never going to see ads on a Netflix product, despite the potential for lower prices and creating more revenue. Hastings didn't have to mention Hulu or YouTube by name to know those are the platforms he was referring to. \"Really having great experience -- no advertisements or chopping up all of the content -- vastly outweigh the fact that one company is gaining a lot of influence.\"", "stock": "NFLX", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-07", "source": "engadget", "url": "https://www.engadget.com/2018/03/07/netflix-ceo-reed-hastings-live-tv-disney-marvel/"}, {"article": "Netflix Inc.\u2019s stock price surge is finally bringing out the bears.  The streaming video giant\u2019s stock is down 4.9% in the first two days of the week to about $316, a rare pullback for shares that have more than doubled over the last 12 months and climbed 22% in the last month alone. The gains have outshone many of Netflix\u2019s high-flying tech-focused peers.  The recent drop followed remarks by short-seller Andrew Left of Citron Research, who said in a tweet Monday that shares, \u201ccan be shorted back to $300,\u201d after the company\u2019s market cap surged in the preceding week.  \u201cI think the market has become over-enthused by the product and not realistic about the economics,\u201d he said in an interview. Mr. Left, who is known for shorting such companies as Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc., said he is currently betting against the stock.  Netflix shares have a long history of momentum-driven growth that\u2019s drawn passionate arguments from both bulls and bears. The company has posted consistently strong subscriber growth and invested heavily in its original content. It\u2019s also been burning through cash and borrowing heavily. It faces a slew of upstart rivals, from Amazon.com Inc. to Walt Disney Co.  Scott Devitt, an analyst at Stifel, recently dropped his rating on the company to \u201chold,\u201d from \u201cbuy.\u201d In a report to clients last week, he wrote that the \u201cshare price may have sprinted ahead of fundamentals in the short-term.\u201d  The company\u2019s chief executive, Reed Hastings, has counted himself among the stock price skeptics in the past. In the summer of 2015, when the stock was at about $100, Mr. Hastings said in response to a question about whether the stock is overpriced: \u201cwhen the stock was half this price, I described it as euphoric. So it\u2019s a mystery to me.\u201d  Still, the recent surge has its benefits, the company has said. In a recent quarterly letter, the company noted that a thick \u201cequity cushion\u201d has been good for its borrowing in the junk bond market. The company has about $6.5 billion in total debt, according to FactSet, and its bond prices have held up relatively well recently. A spokesman for the firm declined to comment.  The Netflix critics have had a tough run recently. The stock had an average short position worth $5.5 billion so far this year, which has sustained paper losses of nearly $3 billion in 2018 through the end of last week, according to financial analytics firm S3 Partners. So far this week, they\u2019ve made back about $319 million.  Short sellers bet against a stock by borrowing from a lender and selling it, hoping to buy it back at a lower price when they return it later on. They pocket the difference if the stock has fallen, but can expose themselves to sharp losses if it rises, as Netflix has done.  The number of shorted shares has fallen recently as investors pared their positions. Many have bumped up against limits on how much risk they can take as the stock price has risen, according to Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3.

The computer-chip maker Nvidia Corp. didn't fumble an earnings forecast, but its stock tumbled this week, too. Facebook Inc.'s financial power hasn't weakened (so far), yet it has shed a Morgan Stanley worth of market value in two weeks.  Right now, investors worry technology companies might succumb not to competition or business missteps, but to consequences of their own hubris or market power. It all feels overdue, but also odd. We've been writing for so long about the looming technology reckoning that it's surprising to realize investors finally care.  Amazon's stock price fell 4.4 percent on Wednesday after Axios reported that President Donald Trump is \"obsessed\" with the e-commerce titan and imagines ways to curtail its power. In a tweet on Thursday, Trump confirmed that he's concerned about Amazon's impact on cities and states, the U.S. Postal Service and smaller retailers. In response, Amazon shares are falling in early trading.  Facebook has dropped since revelations that a political consulting firm took advantage of the company's formerly lax data rules. Nvidia shares are down almost 10 percent this week after the company said it would suspend tests of driverless cars on public roads in response to an Uber autonomous car hitting and killing a pedestrian. (Nvidia provides technology for Uber's autonomous cars.)  Feeling the Pain A half dozen prominent U.S. tech companies have lost more than $80 billion of combined stock market value this week Source: Bloomberg  These companies aren't all faultless victims. Amazon is not a cuddly charity. Years of Facebook's cavalier attitude about data privacy and the downsides of its social network have created this crisis. Right now, though, investors are realizing that tech companies are so big, pervasive and economically important that suspicion is a permanent fact of life now, and backlash has become a real cost of doing business.  I was both surprised, and not, at Amazon's stock reaction. The U.S. president's antipathy for Amazon or CEO Jeff Bezos is no secret. Last summer, Trump tweeted a not-quite-accurate criticism about Amazon's tax payments. He also said previously that Amazon had a \"huge antitrust problem,\" and tweeted that the company is hurting U.S. cities and states. In December and again in Thursday's tweet, Trump said the U.S. Postal Service's finances were hurt by its business with Amazon. (That one is more complicated than 280 characters can convey). It's tough to know whether Trump truly believes Amazon is causing harm, or whether he harbors a grudge against the Bezos-owned Washington Post. Maybe both.  Trump isn't alone in questioning Amazon's power, but there's not an easy legal weapon to wield. Axios said Trump has \"talked about changing Amazon's tax treatment,\" but it's not clear how tax changes could specifically target Amazon. The company is well-regarded by consumers. Amazon is a bogeyman of many industries, but it only captures perhaps a few percentage points of total U.S. retail spending. Conventional approaches to antitrust law don't apply easily to Amazon, although some academics have said the applications of the law need to change. And needless to say, the White House doesn't directly control U.S. antitrust authorities.  Losing Their Bite An index of 10 large global technology companies, including Facebook and Apple, has dipped 14 percent from a mid-March peak Source: Bloomberg  Assuming Trump's tweet barrage against Amazon doesn't continue, the company's stock decline is likely to be short-lived. But investors' temporary panic is understandable. It's far better for powerful tech companies like Amazon to fly under the radar right now. Apple and Amazon should have sent thank-you cards to Mark Zuckerberg for drawing 100 percent of the fire recently from members of Congress, global regulators and skeptical tech journalists. But the fresh glimpse at Trump's thinking showed that there's plenty of unwanted attention to go around for the tech giants.  There's also general investor rethinking -- not for the first time -- about the tech concentration in the stock market after several years of outsize gains in the sector. As with market reaction to the tech backlash, this has little to do with the tech superpowers' current businesses, which remain solid. Nothing has changed. Except everything has changed.

That hasn't been the case in recent years, however, as games focus less on pumping in more polygons and instead make small-but-meaningful upgrades with things like texture quality, resolution, lighting, and visual effects work.  Ray tracing looks to be another one of those seemingly modest, but potentially significant upgrades that will hit the gaming landscape in the near future.  What is ray tracing you might ask? It's a much more advanced and lifelike way of rendering light and shadows in a scene. It's what movies and TV shows use to create and blend in amazing CG work with real-life scenes. The drawback is ray tracing often requires extensive server farms to pre-render graphics. That's been too much to ask from a real-time, interactive video game running on a compact box in your home.  Well, at least until now. At the Game Developers Conference, Nvidia, Microsoft, and AMD announced initiatives that will finally make ray tracing possible in real-time games, which means dazzling effects and much more immersive game worlds. Here's a look at what to expect, who's involved in this new push, and what they're bringing to the table.  What is ray tracing?  Ray tracing is a rendering technique that can produce incredibly realistic lighting effects. Essentially, an algorithm can trace the path of light, and then simulate the way that the light interacts with the virtual objects it ultimately hits in the computer-generated world.  We've seen in-game lighting effects become more and more realistic over the years, but the benefits of ray tracing are less about the light itself and more about how it interacts with the world.  Ray tracing allows for dramatically more lifelike shadows and reflections, along with much-improved translucence and scattering. The algorithm takes into account where the light hits and calculates the interaction and interplay much like the human eye would process real light, shadows, and reflections, for example. The way light hits objects in the world also affects which colors you see.  With enough computational power available, it's possible to produce incredibly realistic CG images that are nearly indistinguishable from life. But that's the problem: even a well-equipped gaming PC only has so much GPU power to work with, let alone a modern game console.  Ray tracing is used extensively when developing computer graphics imagery for films and TV shows, but that's because studios can harness the power of an entire server farm (or cloud computing) to get the job done. And even then, it can be a long, laborious process. Doing it on the fly has been far too taxing for existing gaming hardware.  Instead, video games use rasterization, which is a much speedier way to render computer graphics. It converts the 3D graphics into 2D pixels to display on your screen, but rasterization then requires shaders to depict reasonably lifelike lighting effects.  The results just don't look quite as natural or realistic as they would with ray tracing. The benefits of this technology probably won't seem individually mind-blowing, but the collective enhancements could really elevate the realism of interactive game worlds.  Who is working on ray tracing?  Microsoft is the biggest fish in this new video game ray tracing pond, as the company announced DirectX Raytracing (DXR) in the DirectX 12 API. They've created the structure for introducing and computing rays in the world, and have made it possible for developers to begin experimenting with the technology to see what's possible in their game engines.  And they're not alone: Microsoft has been working with several of the world's biggest game makers and game engine creators to help introduce ray tracing into PC games. Electronic Arts' Frostbite and SEED engines will be compatible, along with the ubiquitous Unreal Engine and Unity engine seen throughout the industry.  Creators can get started right away, too, thanks to an experimental DXR SDK available now. Microsoft will share further insight at GDC 2018 this week.  Bringing ray tracing to life in games requires incredible GPU power, so unsurprisingly, Nvidia is also leading the charge. The company's RTX technology leverages a decade of work on graphics algorithms and GPUs, and they're working closely with Microsoft's DXR API to get developers up to speed quickly.  According to Nvidia, \"film-quality algorithms\" and updates to their GameWorks API will deliver lighting, reflections, shadows, and related effects with a previously-unseen level of fidelity. And Nvidia's incoming Volta-class GPUs will be compatible, of course.  And AMD won't be left behind, either. They haven't shared as much as Nvidia yet as of this writing, but they have announced \"real-time ray tracing\" capabilities via their ProRender rendering engine and Radeon GPU Profiler 1.2. However, AMD's announcement seems less focused on games at this point, and more about improving developers' workflows and results with a blend of ray tracing and rasterization.  When will we see the benefits?  While AMD's approach doesn't seem targeted towards games just yet, that same sort of mixed approach is probably what we'll see in the gaming world to start. As Microsoft's official blog post suggested, DirectX Raytracing will \"supplement current rendering techniques.\"  In other words, it'll make some improvements over rasterization, but not fully replace it. Even tomorrow's GPUs probably aren't fully up to that task. But ray tracing will be another tool in game developers' toolkits, and one that will become more and more important over time.  Microsoft suggests that ray tracing will gain more focus \"over the next several years\" for things that rasterization just doesn't excel in, including global illumination. \"Eventually, ray tracing may completely replace rasterization as the standard algorithm for rendering 3D scenes,\" the post concludes.  That's a far-off possibility, but these are important steps in the right direction. Nvidia's new tech demos show that companies like Remedy Entertainment (Quantum Break) and Epic Games (Fortnite) are already learning the ins and outs of ray tracing and delivering dazzling results.  It seems possible that we'll see ray tracing start to roll out in games running on high-end GPUs (like Nvidia's Volta series) in the near future, perhaps later in 2018. Nothing is concrete yet, however.  For now, though, it's exciting to think that this long-awaited ability is finally on the horizon \u2013 and it will only help bridge the gap in graphical fidelity between interactive worlds and the kind of incredible CGI work seen on the big screen.

From keyboards to mice, monitors, gaming chairs and headsets, PC gaming hardware goes much farther than your main rig.  While we\u2019re all still lusting after that ultra-wide gaming monitor or fancy keyboard, there are always new products to pine after. This year at CES 2018 , we got our first glimpse of some of the most desirable pieces of gaming gear we\u2019ve seen yet.  Asus Bezel-Free Kit  Multi-monitor setups for PC gaming can be amazing, especially for flight simulators and racing games but the only thing that sucks is seeing gaps between each of your screens. Asus\u2019 Bezel-Free monitor kit aims to eliminate the problem by optically merging two or more screens into a seamless picture.  Because it only uses prisms and the magic of light refraction, they can be slipped between practically any monitors with thin bezels and require no electronic control or power to work. If you\u2019re already using a dual or triple monitor setup, this is the easiest way to DIY an ultra-wide screen rather than outright buying a whole new display.  Expected: Late 2018  HP Omen X 65 BFGD  Nvidia Big Format Gaming Displays made a huge splash at CES 2018, and we came away most impressed by the HP version: the Omen X 65 BFGD . Just looking at specifications that include a 65-inch panel, 4K resolution, HDR compliancy, a 120Hz refresh rate and 1 millisecond response rate, it\u2019s hard not to be wowed. This truly is the ultimate display for PC gaming.  Expected: Fall 2018  Nvidia GeForce Now for PC beta  While this might not be a physical bit of kit, Nvidia GeForce Now coming to PC is something everyone will love. This gaming streaming service turns every Windows laptop, desktop and tablet into a gaming PC \u2013 whether it be a lowly netbook or a top of the line Ultrabook, almost anyone can access Nvidia\u2019s extensive online PC game library.  Expected: Available now  Corsair Dark Core RGB SE & MM1000 Qi  We\u2019ve seen a plenty of wireless mice and even a few wireless charging mice, but the Dark Core RGB SE is the first Qi-charging gaming mouse in the world. When paired with Corsair\u2019s new MM1000 Qi wireless charging mouse pad, you can practically run the Dark Core RGB SE forever. As a bonus, the whole wireless charging setup is fully compatible with Qi-charging phones, including the latest iPhone X and Samsung Galaxy Note 8 .  Expected: Available now  Cooler Master MasterKeys MK851  The Cooler Master MasterKeys MK851 might just look like another RGB backlit mechanical keyboard, but it comes with the unique feature of analog keys. Modern keyboards are fully digital inputs, but on its latest product, Cooler Master has included eight analog keys around and including the WASD keys.  These analog switches allow you to lightly press keys to move characters around more slowly. Alternatively, they could act like physical pedals for racing games and many more precise controls we\u2019ve yet to even imagine.  Expected: Mid 2018  Zotac AMP Box  We\u2019ve seen prototypes of Zotac external GPU box for well over a year now, so it was exciting to finally see it in its final form at CES 2018. Unlike the Razer Core and Asus ROG Station 2, the Zotac AMP Box is quite a bit smaller and designed for only mini GPUs. That said, this is one of the finest GPU boxes built completely out of aluminum while also featuring a fully customizable RGB lighting setup.  Expected: Early 2018  Razer Nommo Pro  Computer speakers are often overlooked for a PC gaming setup, but Razer\u2019s new Razer Nommo Pro delivers an incredible audio bang that headphones could never muster. The 2.1 THX certified speaker system features a Dupont Kevlar coated driver that projects solid mids, while silk-woven tweeters produce smooth and balanced highs.  Meanwhile, a cylindrical downward-firing subwoofer is designed to generate airflow for consistent, deep tones. Put all together, it\u2019s one of the fullest-sounding and loudest PC gaming speaker systems we\u2019ve ever heard.  Expected: Early 2018  Vertagear PL4500 RGB Gaming Chair  We never thought it would be possible, but Vertagear has integrated RGB lighting into a gaming chair. The PL4500 RGB comes with lighting built into the harness through-holes and underneath its base for an underglow effect. The whole thing is powered by batteries \u2013 that Vertagear claims can power its RGB gaming chair for 30 hours \u2013 and it can even wirelessly sync effects and colors to your PC through NZXT CAM. It\u2019s the perfect piece of furniture to complement your RGB lit PC, keyboard, mouse, mousepad and room lighting.  Expected: Spring 2018  SteelSeries Rival 600  The SteelSeries Rival 600 is one of the first dual-sensor gaming mice we\u2019ve seen. Going with two sensors not only makes it more accurate, it also reduces sensor drifting when you lift off with your mouse. This gaming mouse also comes with eight 4g weights, allowing users to increase its weight from 96g all the way to 128g.  Expected: Available now  MSI Optix MPG27CQ  We\u2019ve seen RGB lighting come to gaming monitors before, but the MSI Optix MPG27CQ might be the first display to actually put it to good use. Rather than putting the lights behind the screen or give monitors an underglow effect, they\u2019re right below the panel. This way users can set lights to signal ability cooldowns and other in-game timers or Discord chat notifications. We\u2019ve seen the same sort of utility come to keyboards, but it makes much more sense to get this information on a monitor you\u2019re already staring at.

Above, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang speaks at CES earlier this year. Photo: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg News  Nvidia NVDA -1.32% and Facebook are two very different companies. But both have recently come to learn a painful lesson: When tech is everywhere, so are the risks.  Facebook, of course, has been battered over its handling of user data. Nvidia\u2019s challenges are very different. The company, whose main business is making chips for videogames, has spent the past couple of years aggressively building chips designed to run self-driving cars. This has led to partnerships with several auto makers as well as companies like Uber, which has been developing its own fleet of autonomous vehicles.  But the problem with putting tech in the driver\u2019s seat is that the buck tends to stop there as well. One of Uber\u2019s self-driving cars was involved in a fatal accident on March 18. Nvidia\u2019s technology wasn\u2019t blamed for the incident, and CEO Jensen Huang said late Wednesday that Uber doesn\u2019t even use the company\u2019s self-driving car system.  But Nvidia still elected to temporarily suspend tests of the vehicles using its platform while investigating the matter. That has meant a lot of bucks for Nvidia\u2019s investors. The highflying stock has shed 12%\u2014nearly $18 billion in market value\u2014since the accident.  Nvidia still generates most of its sales from graphics chips used in videogames. But the company\u2019s significant advancements with artificial intelligence has opened the door to new and expansive opportunities. Companies like Google, Microsoft and Amazon are snapping up Nvidia\u2019s chips to deploy artificial intelligence capabilities in their data centers. Nvidia\u2019s sales into this segment more than doubled in the fiscal year ended January and are expected to surge more than 60% this year to about $3.2 billion. The company also told analysts on Tuesday that it now sees its total addressable market in this space as being worth about $50 billion in the next five years.  The opportunity for self-driving cars is further out. Nvidia is projected to get 5% of its total revenue from autos in the next two years, but much of that will come from infotainment systems, not autonomous vehicles. But while that may limit the actual business risk, Nvidia\u2019s name is now closely synced to the development of autonomous cars. That means mishaps involving those types of cars will likely weigh on the company\u2019s shares.  That is far different from Facebook, whose core business is under fire. Yet both stocks have fallen sharply over the past two weeks. Nvidia\u2019s was hit so hard in part because its market value has doubled over the past year.  That has put the chipmaker\u2019s value on par with that of much-larger tech names like IBM . Nvidia also is one of the more expensive chip stocks on the market at 35 times forward earnings, though its rapidly expanding bottom line has moderated that valuation a bit. The company\u2019s record to this point suggests it can still deliver on some outsize expectations. But investors should be ready for new twists in the road.

The region is critical because it will see its internet economy grow to $200 billion by 2025, according to Google estimates cited by TechCrunch. In 2017, JD.com's investments in Southeast Asia expanded beyond its beachhead in Indonesia, for example, through large investments in e-commerce companies in Thailand and Vietnam. A key factor behind JD.com's overall success in 2018 will be whether the firm can grow its volume in Southeast Asia against mounting competitive pressure form Alibaba and others.", "stock": "BABA", "label": 1, "date": "2018-03-05", "source": "business-insider", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/jdcoms-efforts-fend-off-alibaba-losses-q4-2018-3"}, {"article": "Alibaba  Alibaba is expanding Hema, a chain of cashless supermarkets.

The 13th National People\u2019s Congress has promised to accelerate the reform program once more, with a renewed commitment to put \u201cthe market\u201d at the center of the economy. We will see.  Perhaps the greatest analytical error across the West has been the view that Xi Jinping would want to continue to sustain the liberal, international rules-based order once its economic power began to rival that of the United States. Again, this hope goes against the well-known facts: China has long said that it sees the existing order as one invented by the victors of the last world war, one in which China did not have a seat at the table.  China has never shared the West\u2019s view of human rights. It has long sought to weaken the powers of the United Nations Human Rights Commission. China has at best had an ambivalent attitude to free trade \u2014 just look at its qualified support for the World Trade Organization, its opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership and its own long history of mercantilism.  And as for the global security order, China has never changed its hostility to the global system of American military alliances, in particular those in the Asia Pacific, which it has long attacked as legacies of the Cold War. That\u2019s in addition to China\u2019s assertion of its territorial claims in the South China Sea.  For these reasons, Mr. Xi has explicitly called for \u201ca new type of great power relations,\u201d \u201ca new type of international system\u201d emerging out of the \u201ccurrent struggle for the international order\u201d and a new type of activist Chinese diplomacy that puts to bed Deng Xiaoping\u2019s dictum of \u201chide your strength, bide your time, and never take the lead.\u201d Hence its efforts to foster an alternative multilateral system with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the Belt and Road Initiative.  Over time Mr. Xi would like to turn the page on the liberal Western order and write a new chapter in world history. If China in the next decade becomes the largest economy in the world with Mr. Xi still likely its leader, the country\u2019s economic success would be based on a form of state capitalism that rejects the notion that rising income parallels broader economic liberalization and political democracy.  None of us knows how much Mr. Xi will seek to apply the principles of this \u201cChina model\u201d to the wider international order. There will be tensions here. But we should be very clear about what Mr. Xi wants for China itself, rather than seeing it through the rose-colored glasses of the West, still shaped by the images of Deng Xiaoping\u2019s China, a quarter of a century ago.

BIDU -1.37% has filed for an initial public offering in the U.S., promoting its ability to use artificial intelligence and user data to deliver videos that generate billions of views.  In a U.S. regulatory filing, Baidu said it would list iQiyi on the Nasdaq exchange and is seeking to raise around $1.5 billion. Analysts at Jefferies have valued iQiyi at $17 billion.  The move comes as Baidu looks to raise money for the loss-making unit to stay ahead in the fiercely competitive video-streaming sector where tech titans Tencent Holdings Ltd. TCEHY -3.15% and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA -2.21% also have strong plays. Baidu told investors in its most recent earnings call that it would remain iQiyi\u2019s controlling shareholder.  IQiyi, which was founded in 2010 and will list under the ticker IQ, said it is China\u2019s largest video-streaming service by amount of time spent watching, with more than 50 million paid subscribers.  Two of its original series, \u201cThe Mystic Nine\u201d and \u201cBurning Ice,\u201d have together garnered more than 13 billion views, the company said in its filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  \u201cWe distinguish ourselves in the online entertainment industry by our leading technology platform powered by advanced AI, big data analytics and other core proprietary technologies,\u201d the company said in its filing. \u201cOur core proprietary technologies are critical to producing content that caters to user tastes, delivering superior entertainment experience to our users.\u201d  In China, people spend the majority of their online-entertainment time on video, and the market overall is expected to grow to 688 billion yuan ($109 billion) by 2022, up from about 51 billion yuan in 2012, iQiyi said, citing a report by iResearch Consulting Group.  But a tough competitive environment and the costs of providing content have made streaming a money-losing proposition for Baidu, as well as for its internet rivals Tencent and Alibaba.  \u201cWe incurred net losses since our inception,\u201d iQiyi said in its filing, including losses of 3.7 billion yuan in 2017.  Junwen Woo, a senior analyst at IHS Markit who tracks online video in Asia, said iQiyi has potential because of its use of AI, which helps the company differentiate from competing Chinese video platforms operated by much bigger rivals Alibaba and Tencent.  \u201cThey can know what is the most popular content and what are the most favorite things viewers like\u2014and what is coming up next,\u201d she said.  In fundraising last year, iQiyi raised $1.53 billion, an investment that came months after investors balked at a $2.3 billion buyout bid from a group led by Baidu Chief Executive Robin Li, saying the proposal undervalued the unit.  Goldman Sachs , Credit Suisse and Bank of America Merrill Lynch are the lead underwriters of the IPO.  \u2014Wayne Ma in Hong Kong contributed to this article.

The country\u2019s securities regulator has reached out to a number of state-owned investment banks to explore ways to let already-listed companies and private businesses issue shares on the mainland, according to investment bankers briefed on the discussions.  \u2018The government has a long-term plan to wean these companies off the U.S.\u2019 \u2014Paul Gillis, Peking University\u2019s Guanghua School of Management  One option being considered is to allow such companies to issue depositary receipts, so they can bypass Chinese law prohibiting firms incorporated overseas from going public on the mainland. The likes of Tencent and Alibaba are incorporated abroad in a special corporate structure so they can get around Chinese restrictions on foreigners investing in sectors like technology.  It is part of China\u2019s longer-term goal to turn the tide on years of the country\u2019s businesses going public overseas. Beijing would like to see more Chinese companies choose the mainland capital market as their primary listing destination eventually, the investment bankers said.  \u201cAt some point, it makes sense for Alibaba and Tencent to have their primary listings in China,\u201d said Paul Gillis, an accounting professor at Peking University\u2019s Guanghua School of Management. \u201cThe government has a long-term plan to wean these companies off the U.S.\u201d  \u201cThis would be a step in that direction,\u201d he said.  Tencent and Alibaba are already among the world\u2019s most valuable companies, and China has earmarked frontier technologies such as artificial intelligence as important growth drivers for the country\u2019s economy.  Shares in Hong Kong-listed Tencent\u2014the owner of China\u2019s most popular messaging app, WeChat\u2014more than doubled last year. In the process Tencent became the first Chinese technology company to crack the $500 billion valuation club, joining industry titans such as Facebook Inc. and Apple Inc.  NYSE-listed shares of Alibaba, China\u2019s largest e-commerce company, almost doubled last year. Alibaba now has a market capitalization of more than $460 billion.  In recent days, a number of tech companies said they are open to a China listing, though executives haven\u2019t gone into details. Tencent Chief Executive Pony Ma said the company would \u201cactively consider\u201d listing inside China. Baidu Inc. Chairman Robin Li said recently that the search-engine company has \u201calways wanted to come home to China.\u201d Richard Liu, chairman of Nasdaq-listed e-commerce company JD.com Inc., said \u201cif the authorities allow it, we are willing.\u201d The executives were speaking on the sidelines of China\u2019s annual legislative meetings, currently taking place in Beijing.  Chinese technology firms have in the past often opted for overseas listings, many in the U.S., for the prestige and to benefit from rules allowing dual-class share structures that give company owners more control over the business. The Chinese regulator\u2019s tough listing rules, such as the requirement for companies to be profitable for three years before listing, have also deterred high-growth technology firms from seeking direct share sales at home.  The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month that Chinese regulators have already approached smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp., which has plans to go public in Hong Kong. Investors say it would be sensible for China\u2019s technology companies to list at home, given the brand awareness they command there and the likelihood their shares would trade at high valuations.  Still, analysts have some concerns. Depending on how contracts are drawn up, Chinese individual investors buying depository receipts could lack full shareholder rights, they say. The listings of a few hot names could also fuel speculation by Chinese individual investors, who dominate trading on the mainland.  \u201cWhen the government is supporting something, everyone rushes in,\u201d said T.J. Wong, a professor of business administration and accounting at the University of Southern California\u2019s Marshall School of Business. \u201cWhat you don\u2019t want is a huge bubble, then a burst.\u201d  Chinese companies often have to wait years before getting approval from the market regulator to list their shares. The authorities would likely expedite this process for some tech firms, the investment bankers said.  Letting a number of top-quality companies issue shares on the mainland could help the Chinese market mature, analysts said. Beijing\u2019s goal, said one foreign banker, is to \u201ctake the winners.\u201d  It isn\u2019t clear when the regulator would formally invite specific companies into its market, given that changes to Chinese securities law would need high-level leadership approval.  \u2014Yoko Kubota contributed to this article.
